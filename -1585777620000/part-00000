The flag of the [[Crown of Aragon]] was a yellow flag with four red stripes (an element which is still common in the present flags of the territories that formed the Crown: [[Aragon]], [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], the [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Roussillon]] in [[France]]). The [[Crown of Castile]], since the final union between the kingdoms of [[kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] in 1230, used a [http://flagspot.net/flags/es-cl_hi.html#his quartered flag] alternating the Castilian (Gules, a tower Or, masoned sable and ajour\u00e9 azure) and Leonese (Argent, a lion rampant purpure crowned or, langued and armed gules) emblems.

It is more properly called {{lang-es|Cruz de San Andr\u00e9s|label=none}} ([[Saltire|Saint Andrew's Cross]]) or \"the Vane of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]]\". It functioned as the symbol of the Archduke. Since the reign of [[Charles I of Spain]] (1516-1556), different Spanish armies have used flags with the Cross of Burgundy on different fields. It was also incorporated in the uniforms of Burgundian archers, and later in the uniforms of the rest of the army. It also appeared on Spanish regimental flags.\n\n===Habsburg Spain===\nWhen the [[Habsburg Spain|House of Habsburg took the Spanish throne]] by mid-16th century each military company had its own flag in which appeared usually the arms of its commander over the [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|Cross of Burgundy]]. In order to represent the King, they used to have another one, the \"Coronela\", during the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] (Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor) that was made of yellow silk (the imperial color) with the embroidered [[Coat of arms of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|imperial shield]].<ref>[http://www.ejercito.mde.es/Unidades/es/unidades/Madrid/ihycm/Actividades/cursos/vexi-historia-bandera.html The flag of Spain, Spanish Army] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401153446/http://www.ejercito.mde.es/Unidades/es/unidades/Madrid/ihycm/Actividades/cursos/vexi-historia-bandera.html |date=April 1, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] came to power, he ordered that, in addition to the flags of each company, each [[Tercio]] should have another one of yellow color with the [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|Cross of Burgundy]] in red. The units of Cavalry took the same flags but of smaller size, called [[Banners]].\n\nHowever, at this time the concept of a national flag as understood nowadays did not exist, and so the true symbol of the nationality was represented by the Royal arms. The use of other flags besides the mentioned ones was frequent, with various images or symbols. Some examples are the flag of [[James, son of Zebedee|Santiago]] (Saint James the Great), the green one the Emperor took during the conquest of [[Tunisia]] or the crimson one used by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] in [[Mexico]].\n\n===Philip V and the new Bourbon dynasty===\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Bandera militar Spain 1700.jpg|Military flag of Philip V [[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] [[File:FIAV 011000.svg|20px]]\n|Bandera de Espa\u00f1a 1701-1760.svg|Bourbonic flag (1701\u20131760)[[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] [[File:FIAV 000011.svg|20px]]\n|Bandera de Espa\u00f1a 1760-1785.svg|Bourbonic flag (1760\u20131785)[[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] [[File:FIAV 000011.svg|20px]]\n}}\n\nThe arms of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon-Anjou]] were added in 1700 when [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] became king of Spain.

For this reason, he ordered to his Minister of the Navy to present several models of flags to him, having to be visible from great distances. The Minister selected twelve sketches which were shown to the king. The flag that was chosen as [[war ensign]] is the direct ancestor of the current flag. It was a triband red-yellow-red, of which the yellow band was twice the width of the red bands, a unique feature that distinguished the Spanish tribanded flag from other tribanded European flags. The flag chosen as [[civil ensign]] or for Merchant Marine use, meanwhile, consisted of five stripes of yellow-red-yellow-red-yellow, in proportions 1:1:2:1:1.\n\n===Second Spanish Republic===\n{{Main|Flag of the Second Spanish Republic}}\n[[File:Castile Arms.svg|upright|thumb|Coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Castile]]]]\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of Spain 1931 1939.svg|State flag of the Second Spanish Republic [[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] [[File:FIAV 011011.svg|20px]]\n|Flag of the Second Spanish Republic (plain).svg|Civil flag of the Second Spanish Republic [[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] [[File:FIAV 100100.svg|20px]]\n}}\n\nOn 14 April 1931, the monarchy was overthrown and replaced by the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. The regime change was symbolized by a new tricolor flag, red, yellow and [[murrey]] ({{lang-es|morado}}), instead of the previous red and yellow bicolor, considered, at the time, monarchist. The purported aim of the murrey strip was to represent [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] in the flag's colours, as the existing red and yellow represented the territories of the former [[Crown of Aragon]].\nThe Republican flag was officially adopted on 27 April and officially given to the army on 6 May. Formed by three horizontal strips of the same width, red, yellow and {{lang|es|morado}}, with the [[coat of arms of the Second Spanish Republic]] at the center (quarterly of Castile, Leon, Aragon and Navarre, Ent\u00e9 en point for Granada, stamped by a [[mural crown]] between the two [[Pillars of Hercules]]). Another novelty was the smaller dimensions of this flag in its military version, of 1&nbsp;m by 1&nbsp;m.\n\nAs for the addition of the murrey to represent Castile in the national flag, since the last quarter of the 20th century there are authors that contradict former historians sustaining that the Castilian banner was not murrey, but [[crimson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museoferias.net/abril2001.htm |title=PEND\u00d3N REAL DE CASTILLA.

The Republican regime in Spain was destroyed and [[Francisco Franco]] became the ''[[Caudillo]]'' of the country and remained in power until his death on 20 November 1975.\n\nOn 29 August 1936, the \"Junta de Defensa Nacional\", issued Decree No. 77, that declared: \"The red and gold/yellow bicolour flag is re-established as the flag of Spain\", which served as the first flag of Nationalist Spain. This flag was replaced in 1938 by a flag bearing the [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] of [[John the Evangelist]] added to the shield. The new arms were allegedly inspired in the coat of arms the [[Catholic Monarchs]] adopted after the taking of [[Granada]] (represented using a ''granada'', word that also means \"[[pomegranate]]\" in Spanish) from the [[Moors]], but replacing the arms of [[Sicily]]{{which|not seen in the pictures|date=July 2018}} for those of [[Navarre]] and adding the [[Pillars of Hercules]] on each flank of the coat of arms. In 1938 the columns were placed outside the wings.\n\nOn 26 July 1945, the commander's ensigns were suppressed by decree, and on 11 October a detailed regulation of flags was published, that fixed the model of the bi-colour flag in use, with a new version of the Saint John eagle. The models established on that decree were in force until 1977.\n\nDuring this period two more flags were usually displayed together with the national flag: the flag of [[Falange|Spanish Falange]] (three vertical strips, red, black, red, with the black stripe being wider than the red ones, and the ''[[yoke]] and arrows'' emblem in red placed on the centre of the black stripe) and the [[Carlist]] flag (the Saint Andrew [[saltire]] or [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|Cross of Burgundy]] red on white) as representation of the [[Movimiento Nacional|National Movement]].\n\n===Spanish transition===\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of Spain (1977 - 1981).svg|Flag of Spain from 1977 to 1981 [[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] [[File:FIAV 011011.svg|20px]]\n\n}}\n\nFrom the death of Franco in 1975 to 1977, the national flag remained that of the 1945 regulation. On 21 January 1977 a new flag was approved that differed from the previous one in that the eagle's wings opened further (the \"pasmada\" eagle), the [[Pillars of Hercules]] were again placed within the wings, and the ribbon with the motto UNA, GRANDE Y LIBRE (ONE, GREAT and FREE) was moved from the eagle's neck to above the eagle's head. Not many flags with this coat of arms were made. Finally, and after the restoration of the [[House of Bourbon]] to the Spanish Throne in the person of King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]], the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] was published, article 42 section 12 of which reads \"The Flag of Spain is formed by three horizontal stripes, red, yellow and red, the yellow being double the width of each of the red ones.\"\n\nThe national flag of Spain finally received its present-day coat of arms on 19 December 1981.\n\n==Unofficial flags==\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100|Bandeira_Federalista_Ib\u00e9rica_(1854).svg|Iberian Union flag proposal||Flag with Osborne bull|Flag of Spain according to command of Alphonse Charles with Sacred Heart.svg|Spanish flag with the Sacred Heart used by [[Carlism]]}}\n\n* At some point during the 1990s an unofficial version of the Spanish flag sporting an [[Osborne bull]] superimposed as some sort of \"coat of arms\" began appearing in football arenas.

It was frequently made up of other different flags, full of images and symbols that represented all the values that the troops or the King defended.\n===Standard of the Catholic monarchs===\n[[File:Bandera de la Infanter\u00eda de los Reyes Catolicos.svg|thumb|130px|[[Banner of arms|Banner]] of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]' infantry {{FIAV|historical}}{{FIAV|011000}}]]\n\nIn Spain the medieval kingdoms which merged in the sixteenth century had their own heraldic symbols and their navies used to display their own flags and standards on both the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, where the Aragonese and Castilian Crowns had their respective areas of influence. The flag of the [[Crown of Aragon]] was a yellow flag with four red stripes (an element which is still common in the present flags of the territories that formed the Crown: [[Aragon]], [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], the [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Roussillon]] in [[France]]). The [[Crown of Castile]], since the final union between the kingdoms of [[kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] in 1230, used a [http://flagspot.net/flags/es-cl_hi.html#his quartered flag] alternating the Castilian (Gules, a tower Or, masoned sable and ajour\u00e9 azure) and Leonese (Argent, a lion rampant purpure crowned or, langued and armed gules) emblems.

It is more properly called {{lang-es|Cruz de San Andr\u00e9s|label=none}} ([[Saltire|Saint Andrew's Cross]]) or \"the Vane of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]]\". It functioned as the symbol of the Archduke. Since the reign of [[Charles I of Spain]] (1516-1556), different Spanish armies have used flags with the Cross of Burgundy on different fields. It was also incorporated in the uniforms of Burgundian archers, and later in the uniforms of the rest of the army. It also appeared on Spanish regimental flags.\n\n===Habsburg Spain===\nWhen the [[Habsburg Spain|House of Habsburg took the Spanish throne]] by mid-16th century each military company had its own flag in which appeared usually the arms of its commander over the [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|Cross of Burgundy]]. In order to represent the King, they used to have another one, the \"Coronela\", during the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] (Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor) that was made of yellow silk (the imperial color) with the embroidered [[Coat of arms of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|imperial shield]].<ref>[http://www.ejercito.mde.es/Unidades/es/unidades/Madrid/ihycm/Actividades/cursos/vexi-historia-bandera.html The flag of Spain, Spanish Army] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401153446/http://www.ejercito.mde.es/Unidades/es/unidades/Madrid/ihycm/Actividades/cursos/vexi-historia-bandera.html |date=April 1, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] came to power, he ordered that, in addition to the flags of each company, each [[Tercio]] should have another one of yellow color with the [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|Cross of Burgundy]] in red. The units of Cavalry took the same flags but of smaller size, called [[Banners]].\n\nHowever, at this time the concept of a national flag as understood nowadays did not exist, and so the true symbol of the nationality was represented by the Royal arms. The use of other flags besides the mentioned ones was frequent, with various images or symbols. Some examples are the flag of [[James, son of Zebedee|Santiago]] (Saint James the Great), the green one the Emperor took during the conquest of [[Tunisia]] or the crimson one used by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] in [[Mexico]].\n\n===Philip V and the new Bourbon dynasty===\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Bandera militar Spain 1700.jpg|Military flag of Philip V [[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] [[File:FIAV 011000.svg|20px]]\n|Bandera de Espa\u00f1a 1701-1760.svg|Bourbonic flag (1701\u20131760)[[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] [[File:FIAV 000011.svg|20px]]\n|Bandera de Espa\u00f1a 1760-1785.svg|Bourbonic flag (1760\u20131785)[[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] [[File:FIAV 000011.svg|20px]]\n}}\n\nThe arms of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon-Anjou]] were added in 1700 when [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] became king of Spain.

For this reason, he ordered to his Minister of the Navy to present several models of flags to him, having to be visible from great distances. The Minister selected twelve sketches which were shown to the king. The flag that was chosen as [[war ensign]] is the direct ancestor of the current flag. It was a triband red-yellow-red, of which the yellow band was twice the width of the red bands, a unique feature that distinguished the Spanish tribanded flag from other tribanded European flags. The flag chosen as [[civil ensign]] or for Merchant Marine use, meanwhile, consisted of five stripes of yellow-red-yellow-red-yellow, in proportions 1:1:2:1:1.\n\n===Second Spanish Republic===\n{{Main|Flag of the Second Spanish Republic}}\n[[File:Castile Arms.svg|upright|thumb|Coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Castile]]]]\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of Spain 1931 1939.svg|State flag of the Second Spanish Republic [[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] [[File:FIAV 011011.svg|20px]]\n|Flag of the Second Spanish Republic (plain).svg|Civil flag of the Second Spanish Republic [[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] [[File:FIAV 100100.svg|20px]]\n}}\n\nOn 14 April 1931, the monarchy was overthrown and replaced by the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. The regime change was symbolized by a new tricolor flag, red, yellow and [[murrey]] ({{lang-es|morado}}), instead of the previous red and yellow bicolor, considered, at the time, monarchist. The purported aim of the murrey strip was to represent [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] in the flag's colours, as the existing red and yellow represented the territories of the former [[Crown of Aragon]].\nThe Republican flag was officially adopted on 27 April and officially given to the army on 6 May. Formed by three horizontal strips of the same width, red, yellow and ''morado'', with the [[coat of arms of the Second Spanish Republic]] at the center (quarterly of Castile, Leon, Aragon and Navarre, Ent\u00e9 en point for Granada, stamped by a [[mural crown]] between the two [[Pillars of Hercules]]). Another novelty was the smaller dimensions of this flag in its military version, of 1&nbsp;m by 1&nbsp;m.\n\nAs for the addition of the murrey to represent Castile in the national flag, since the last quarter of the 20th century there are authors that contradict former historians sustaining that the Castilian banner was not murrey, but [[crimson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museoferias.net/abril2001.htm |title=PEND\u00d3N REAL DE CASTILLA.

The Republican regime in Spain was destroyed and [[Francisco Franco]] became the ''[[Caudillo]]'' of the country and remained in power until his death on 20 November 1975.\n\nOn 29 August 1936, the \"Junta de Defensa Nacional\", issued Decree No. 77, that declared: \"The red and gold/yellow bicolour flag is re-established as the flag of Spain\", which served as the first flag of Nationalist Spain. This flag was replaced in 1938 by a flag bearing the [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] of [[John the Evangelist]] added to the shield. The new arms were allegedly inspired in the coat of arms the [[Catholic Monarchs]] adopted after the taking of [[Granada]] (represented using a ''granada'', word that also means \"[[pomegranate]]\" in Spanish) from the [[Moors]], but replacing the arms of [[Sicily]]{{which|not seen in the pictures|date=July 2018}} for those of [[Navarre]] and adding the [[Pillars of Hercules]] on each flank of the coat of arms. In 1938 the columns were placed outside the wings.\n\nOn 26 July 1945, the commander's ensigns were suppressed by decree, and on 11 October a detailed regulation of flags was published, that fixed the model of the bi-colour flag in use, with a new version of the Saint John eagle. The models established on that decree were in force until 1977.\n\nDuring this period two more flags were usually displayed together with the national flag: the flag of [[Falange|Spanish Falange]] (three vertical strips, red, black, red, with the black stripe being wider than the red ones, and the ''[[yoke]] and arrows'' emblem in red placed on the centre of the black stripe) and the [[Carlist]] flag (the Saint Andrew [[saltire]] or [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|Cross of Burgundy]] red on white) as representation of the [[Movimiento Nacional|National Movement]].\n\n===Spanish transition===\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of Spain (1977 - 1981).svg|Flag of Spain from 1977 to 1981 [[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] [[File:FIAV 011011.svg|20px]]\n\n}}\n\nFrom the death of Franco in 1975 to 1977, the national flag remained that of the 1945 regulation. On 21 January 1977 a new flag was approved that differed from the previous one in that the eagle's wings opened further (the \"pasmada\" eagle), the [[Pillars of Hercules]] were again placed within the wings, and the ribbon with the motto UNA, GRANDE Y LIBRE (ONE, GREAT and FREE) was moved from the eagle's neck to above the eagle's head. Not many flags with this coat of arms were made. Finally, and after the restoration of the [[House of Bourbon]] to the Spanish Throne in the person of King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]], the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] was published, article 42 section 12 of which reads \"The Flag of Spain is formed by three horizontal stripes, red, yellow and red, the yellow being double the width of each of the red ones.\"\n\nThe national flag of Spain finally received its present-day coat of arms on 19 December 1981.\n\n==Unofficial flags==\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100|Bandeira_Federalista_Ib\u00e9rica_(1854).svg|Iberian Union flag proposal||Flag with Osborne bull|Flag of Spain according to command of Alphonse Charles with Sacred Heart.svg|Spanish flag with the Sacred Heart used by [[Carlism]]}}\n\n* At some point during the 1990s an unofficial version of the Spanish flag sporting an [[Osborne bull]] superimposed as some sort of \"coat of arms\" began appearing in football arenas.

In 1850, the [[Baltimore City Council]] granted the school, then known as the \"Central High School of Baltimore\", the authority to present its graduates with certificates of completion.<ref name=\"Steiner_209\">Steiner (1894), p. 209</ref> An effort to expand that academic power and allow the then named \"Central High School of Baltimore\" to confer Bachelor of Arts degrees began following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1865, and continued the following year with the renaming of the institution as \"The Baltimore City College\", which it still holds to this day, with also the retitling of its chief academic officer from \"[[principal (academia)|principal]]\" to \"[[college president|president]]\", along with an increase in the number of years of its course of study and the expansion of its courses. However, despite this early elevation effort, it ended at that brief period unsuccessfully in 1869, although the B.C.C. continued for a number of years as a hybrid public high school and early form of [[junior college]] (later known as [[community college]]) which did not fully appear in America in different form until the beginning of the 20th century. Very often the elaborate decorative fancy engraved graduation diploma from the B.C.C. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was accepted by many other colleges and universities entitling City graduates to enter upper-division schools at the sophomore year, (which was also coincidentally a privilege also accorded to its later local academic and athletic rival for 127 years - \"Poly\", the [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]], founded 1883 as the Baltimore Manual Training School, later renamed 1893).<ref name=\"Steiner218\">Steiner (1894), p. 218.</ref>\n\nAs the importance of higher education increased in the early 20th century, the High School's priorities shifted to preparing students for college.<ref name=\"BCPSS1902p79\">Board of Commissioners of Public Schools (1902), p. 79.</ref> In 1927, only one year before the school moved from its home at Howard and Centre Streets for 53 years to the magnificent stone \"Castle on the Hill\" on \"Collegian Hill\", the academic program was further changed, when the City College divided its curriculum into two tracks: the standard college preparatory program, or \"'B' Course\", and a more rigorous stiff \"Advanced College Prep\" curriculum, the famed \"'A' Course\" of study focusing on humanities, social studies, liberal arts and the Classics.

African Americans joined City College for the first time at the end of that summer, in September 1954 and became a significant proportion of the student population by the 1960s, with over half black by 1966, reflecting similar trends in the city itself. Mr. Pierre H. Davis, also later became the first \"Negro\"/\"Colored\" teacher to join the B.C.C. faculty the following year of 1955 for only one year in the Business Education Department, along with Eugene Parker in the Physical Education Department, who went on becoming head basketball coach for three decades. Mr. Davis, coincidentally returned 15 years later to become the first Afro-American principal of the City College in September 1970.<ref name=\"hlub51\">Hlubb (1965), p. 51.</ref> The school saw further changes in the student population with the admission of women in 1978.<ref name=\"Daneker58\">Daneker (1988), p. 58.</ref>\n\nAcademic standards and enrollment numbers at the Baltimore City College (B.C.C.) after reaching a high of near 4,000 boys by the mid-1960s went through a period of decline first in the late 1960s to mid 1970s, with the rapid opening of newer additional high schools both in the outreaches of the city along with the rapidly expanding suburbs in surrounding [[Baltimore County]]. Two in the city system were [[Northwestern High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Northwestern]] in 1965 and [[Northern High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Northern]] in the following year. Three high schools were completed and opened all at one time in September 1971, with [[Southwestern High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Southwestern]], [[Walbrook High School|Walbrook]] and a massive huge complex nearby to City in [[Clifton Park, Baltimore|Clifton Park]] on the bed of the old reservoir off Harford Road, [[Lake Clifton High School|Lake Clifton]].

The most significant was the reduction of the five-year course of study to four years; though students who entered prior to 1900 were allowed to complete the five-year course.<ref>Board of Commissioners of Public Schools (1902), p. 7.</ref> The new course, like the course it replaced, allowed graduates to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University without examination, and provided students with greater flexibility. Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses, it allowed students to choose their courses, as long as they completed 150 credits.<ref>Board of Commissioners of Public Schools (1902), p. 22.</ref>\n\nThe program's explicit purpose was to provide special preparation for those wishing to attend college because of the increasing significance of college education. Though specific classes were not required, to meet the goal, students were required to complete courses in [[English literature]] and [[Composition (language)|composition]], four foreign languages, mathematics, science, history, commerce,  drawing, music, and physical culture.<ref name=\"BCPSS1902p79\"/>\n\n== \"Castle on the Hill\" ==\n\n[[File:Castle citycollege.JPG|thumb|left|The Castle on the Hill]]\n\nBy [[World War I]], attendance in the school was rapidly increasing. An annex was added on 26th Street to alleviate overcrowding in the Howard Street building, but it was insufficient. Therefore, during the 1920s, alumni began campaigning to provide a proper building for the school, and in 1926, ground was broken for a massive Collegiate [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] stone castle with a 38-acre (153,781 m\u00b2) campus, on a hill in the newly annexed northeastern suburbs at [[33rd Street (Baltimore)|33rd Street]] and [[The Alameda (Baltimore)|The Alameda]]. The four-level \"Castle on the Hill\", which was surmounted by a 150&nbsp;ft (46&nbsp;m) tower and designed by architects Buckler and Fenhagen, cost almost $3,000,000 and accommodated 2,500 students.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 120.</ref> The \"castle\" featured arched windows and [[cornice (architecture)|cornices]], [[cloisters]], [[gargoyle]]s, [[stained glass]], [[mahogany]] paneling, [[plaster]] arches, [[chandelier]]s and [[terra cotta]] tiles and [[terrazzo]] floors with two courtyards and plans for additional wings and buildings.<ref>Leonhart (1939), pp. 123\u2013124.</ref>\n\n[[File:memorial-plaqueBCC.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial plaque for BCC alumni who died in [[World War I]]]]\n\nThe following year, in 1927, the \"Advanced Academic Course\" (\"A\" Course) was introduced. Students in the \"A\" Course were able to enter their second year of college following their graduation.<ref name=\"Leonhart_121\"/>  This program of study and its counterpart, the college preparatory course (\"B\" Course), became the backbone of City College's academic program for over 60 years.  On April 10, 1928, after nearly two years of construction, \"The Castle on the Hill\" opened its doors to the students and faculty.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 181.</ref> The next year, the students published the first edition of ''The Collegian'', City College's newspaper.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 126.</ref>  The publication quickly became an indispensable part of student life and gained national attention, when it won second place in a contest sponsored by the [[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]] of [[Columbia University]].  ''The Collegian'' held the first place title between 1935\u20131939.<ref>Leonhart (1939), p. 146.</ref>\n\nWhen Japan's attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941 led to U.S. entry into [[World War II]], [[blood donor]] projects, stamp and bond drives, and the dedication of service flags gave the City College a wartime atmosphere. More than three-quarters of the students participated in the [[V Corps (United States)|Victory Corps]], which sponsored courses in communications, map reading, judo and the study of the poisonous and non-poisonous plants on [[Pacific islands]].<ref name=\"BCC57\"/> By the time the war ended in 1945, 4,667 City College students had served in the [[U.S. military|armed forces]], 204 of whom lost their lives.<ref name=\"BCC57\"/> The names of all of the fallen, including two [[Medal of Honor]] recipients, are inscribed on a bronze memorial, which sits today in the center of the school.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Strasburger | editor-first = Victor | title = The 1967 Green Bag | year = 1967 |page =20}}</ref>\n\n== Integration ==\n[[File:Main entrance, Baltimore City College (2007).jpg|left|thumb|Baltimore City College Main Entrance, 2007]]\n\nFollowing the landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the Baltimore City board of school commissioners was forced to [[Desegregation|desegregate]] the school system, which had been racially divided since the 1860s.  As a result, 10 African-American students entered City College in September 1954,<ref>Hlubb (1965), p.  10.</ref> comprising 0.5% of the student population. A decade later, in the 1964\u201365 academic year, African-American students represented 30% of the student population.<ref name=\"hlub51\"/>\n\nIn 1956 the school system also sent two African-American men to teach at the school: Eugene Parker, who coached for thirty years, and Pierre Davis, who left after one year but returned in 1971 as City College's first African-American principal.<ref>Daneker (1988), p. 38.</ref>\n\nAlthough African-American enrollment increased, the transition from the segregated system was not seamless. In 1964, enrollment in the selective \"A\" Course still skewed disproportionately to white students. Only six African Americans were enrolled that year compared with 110 Whites,<ref>Hlubb (1965), p. 20.</ref> and they were similarly underrepresented in extracurricular activities.<ref>Hlubb (1965), p. 34.</ref>\n\nSuch [[De facto segregation|''de facto'' segregation]] was a systemic problem in Baltimore throughout the 1960s.<ref name=\"Paquin\">{{cite web|title=From the Old Order to the New Order\u2013Reasons and Results, 1957\u20131997 |publisher=Baltimore City Public School System |year=2006 |url=http://vtma.baltimorecityschools.org/About/History/From_the_Oldorder1.asp |accessdate=2007-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121073045/http://vtma.baltimorecityschools.org/About/History/From_the_Oldorder1.asp |archivedate=January 21, 2016 }}</ref> To address the problem, Superintendent Laurence G. Paquin proposed a reorganization of Baltimore's high schools. He called for the creation of 13 comprehensive high schools that would offer both vocational training and college preparatory classes, and the elimination of multiple academic tracks in high school. However, Paquin's proposal met stiff opposition from City College parents and alumni, who feared that his plan threatened the foundations of City College's academic program. Councilman [[William Donald Schaefer]], an alumnus of City College, convened a City Council hearing on the proposal, which stymied Paquin's effort.<ref name=\"Paquin\"/>\n\nBy the late 1970s, the school's population, academic program, and building were all in decline, in part reflecting the economic problems of the city as a whole.<ref name=\"BCC57\"/> In 1977, the city school system allocated money to refurbish the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College [[coeducational]]; however, the all-male tradition did not end easily. Alumni argued for the uniqueness of a [[single-sex education]] system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11\u20136 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. In a stunning reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing [[U.S. constitution|constitutional]] concerns over equal rights.<ref name=\"Daneker58\"/> The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.<ref name=\"Paquin\"/>\n\n== Recent history ==\n\n[[File:The Castle on the Hill, 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Castle on the Hill, 2006]]\n\nBy 1990, the school's academic program was once again deteriorating and enrollment was declining.  The [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] raised questions about the ability of City College to offer students an academically rigorous course of study.<ref name=\"Katz-Stone\"/>  During this period of decline, the \"A\" Course was discontinued by Principal Joseph Antenson, who contended that the program was racially discriminatory\u2014an argument Paquin had made nearly three decades earlier\u2014and opted for a standardized curriculum.<ref name=\"End_IB\">{{cite web |title = A Request to End International Baccalaureate at the Baltimore City College | publisher = Baltimore City College Alumni Association |date=May 2007 | url = http://www.cityforever.org/BCCAA_Spring_2_Newsletter2007.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-07-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930040507/http://www.cityforever.org/BCCAA_Spring_2_Newsletter2007.pdf |archivedate = September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>  However, the change did little to improve the school; therefore, in 1992, the school system hired a private contractor to run City College.

A decade later, in the 1964\u201365 academic year, African-American students represented 30% of the student population.<ref name=\"hlub51\"/>\n\nIn 1956 the school system also sent two African-American men to teach at the school: Eugene Parker, who coached for thirty years, and Pierre Davis, who left after one year but returned in 1971 as City College's first African-American principal.<ref>Daneker (1988), p. 38.</ref>\n\nAlthough African-American enrollment increased, the transition from the segregated system was not seamless.

Paquin proposed a reorganization of Baltimore's high schools. He called for the creation of 13 comprehensive high schools that would offer both vocational training and college preparatory classes, and the elimination of multiple academic tracks in high school. However, Paquin's proposal met stiff opposition from City College parents and alumni, who feared that his plan threatened the foundations of City College's academic program. Councilman [[William Donald Schaefer]], an alumnus of City College, convened a City Council hearing on the proposal, which stymied Paquin's effort.<ref name=\"Paquin\"/>\n\nBy the late 1970s, the school's population, academic program, and building were all in decline, in part reflecting the economic problems of the city as a whole.<ref name=\"BCC57\"/> In 1977, the city school system allocated money to refurbish the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College [[coeducational]]; however, the all-male tradition did not end easily. Alumni argued for the uniqueness of a [[single-sex education]] system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11\u20136 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. In a stunning reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing [[U.S. constitution|constitutional]] concerns over equal rights.<ref name=\"Daneker58\"/> The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.<ref name=\"Paquin\"/>\n\n== Recent history ==\n\n[[File:The Castle on the Hill, 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Castle on the Hill, 2006]]\n\nBy 1990, the school's academic program was once again deteriorating and enrollment was declining.

The following year, shipwright Charles Gorsuch settled Whetstone Point, the present location of [[Fort McHenry]]. In 1665, the west side of the Jones Falls on the Inner Harbor was settled when 550 acres of land, thereafter named Cole's Harbor, was granted to Thomas Cole and later sold to David Jones in 1679. [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Old Saint Paul's Parish]] of [[Baltimore County]] was one of the \"Original Thirty\" parishes designated for the Colony. It included the county of Baltimore and future Baltimore Town and was part of the \"established\" or \"state\" [[Church of England]], also known as the [[Anglican Church]]. It was the first church built in the metro area, erected in 1692 on the Patapsco Neck peninsula in southeastern Baltimore County, along the [[Colgate Creek]] which flowed into the [[Patapsco River]] (present site of today's [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]] Marine Terminal of the [[Port of Baltimore]]). Jones's stepson James Todd resurveyed Cole's Harbor in 1696. The tract was renamed Todd's Range, which was then sold off in progressively smaller parcels, thereby forming the land that would become the Town of Baltimore thirty years later.\n\nAnother \"Baltimore\" existed on the Bush River as early as 1674.

The exact location of Old Baltimore was lost for years. It was certain that the location was somewhere on the site of the present-day [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] (APG), a U.S. Army testing facility. in the 1990s, APG's Cultural Resource Management Program took up the task of finding Old Baltimore. The firm of R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates was contracted for the project. After Goodwin first performed historical and archival work, they coordinated their work with existing landscape features to locate the site of Old Baltimore. APG's Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel went in with Goodwin to defuse any unexploded ordnance.

Unlike many other towns established around that time, Baltimore was more than just existence on paper. [[German American|German immigrants]] began to settle along the [[Chesapeake Bay]] by 1723, living in the Baltimore area. The General Assembly enlarged Baltimore Town in 1745 and incorporated David Jones's original settlement known as Jones Town. Baltimore sent representatives to the Assembly, and over the next two decades it acquired nine parcels of land and annexed neighboring villages including Fells Point to become an important community on the head of the [[Patapsco River]]. As the Town grew, increasing numbers of German Lutheran immigrants established [[Zion Lutheran Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Zion Church]] in 1755, and later also a German Reformed congregation was organized as the first among the [[Protestant]]s to be represented which also attracted more of these \"[[Pennsylvania Dutch]]\" settlers to the region. Early German settlers also later established the [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|German Society of Maryland]] in 1783 in order to foster the German language and German culture in Baltimore.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.immigrationbaltimore.org/historical_timeline.htm |title= Significant dates in Baltimore's immigration history |publisher= Baltimore Immigration Memorial Foundation |accessdate= 2012-08-20 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130111231058/http://www.immigrationbaltimore.org/historical_timeline.htm |archive-date= 2013-01-11 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Mount Clare Mansion - Front angle.jpg|alt=View of the front of Mount Clare Mansion.|thumb|[[Mount Clare (Maryland)|Mount Clare Mansion]], known today as the Mount Clare Museum House, is the oldest Colonial-era structure in Baltimore.]]\nThroughout the 18th Century, Baltimore drained and filled in marshes (notably Thomas \"Harrison's Marsh\" along the Jones Falls west bank), built canals around the falls and through the center of town, built bridges across the Falls and annexed neighboring [[Jonestown, Baltimore|Jones's Town]] to the northeast in 1745 and expanded southeastward towards the neighboring, bustling, shipbuilding port at [[Fells Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]]. It became by far the largest city in the Middle Atlantic colonies between [[Philadelphia]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. A political deal by the increasingly powerful financial interests in the growing town and with the rapidly growing population, was reached and the county seat with its important center of a courthouse for all Baltimore County was moved from Old Joppa over its citizens enraged protests. Baltimoreans paid some 300 pounds sterling the next year to erect a fine brick courthouse with a bell tower and steeple on a Courthouse Square (future Calvert Street, between East Lexington and Fayette Streets) along with the necessary \"whipping post\", [[stocks]] (for confining heads and arms), podium for making public announcements and news, and a nearby jail, on the northern hills overlooking the harbor basin and with its back sitting over a rugged cliff and bluffs to the northeast with \"Steiger's Meadow\" bordering the twisting loop of the [[Jones Falls]] which bended southwestward before running north again.\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], the [[Second Continental Congress]] temporarily fled from Philadelphia and held sessions in Baltimore between December 1776 and February 1777. When the Continental Congress authorized the privateering of British vessels, eager Baltimore merchants accepted the challenge, and as the war progressed, the shipbuilding industry expanded and boomed. There was no major military action near the city though, except for the passing nearby and a feint towards the town by the British [[Royal Navy]] fleet as they headed north up the Chesapeake Bay to land an army at [[Elkton, Maryland|Head of Elk]] in the northeast corner to march on the American capital at [[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and the following battles at [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]] and [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]].\n\nThe American Revolution stimulated the domestic market for wheat and iron ore, and in Baltimore flour milling increased along the [[Jones Falls|Jones]] and [[Gwynns Falls]]. Iron ore transport greatly boosted the local economy. The British naval blockade hurt Baltimore's shipping, but also freed merchants and traders from British debts, which along with the capture of British merchant vessels furthered Baltimore's economic growth. By 1800 Baltimore had become one of the major cities of the new republic.<ref>Garrett Power,  \"Parceling out Land in the Vicinity of Baltimore: 1632-1796, Part 2,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1993 88(2): 150-180,</ref>\n\nThe economic foundations laid down between 1763 and 1776 were vital to the even greater expansion seen during the Revolutionary War. Though still lagging behind Philadelphia, Baltimore merchants and entrepreneurs produced an expanding commercial community with family businesses and partnerships proliferating in shipping, the flour-milling and grain business, and the indentured servant traffic. International trade focused on four areas: Britain, Southern Europe, the West Indies, and the North American coastal towns. Credit was the essence of the system and a virtual chain of indebtedness meant that bills remained long unpaid and little cash was used among overseas correspondents, merchant wholesalers, and retail customers. Bills of exchange were used extensively, often circulating as currency. Frequent crises of credit, and the wars with France kept prices and markets in constant flux, but men such as William Lux and the Christie brothers produced a maturing economy and a thriving metropolis by the 1770s.<ref>Paul K.  Walker, \"Business and Commerce in Baltimore on the Eve of Independence,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1976 71(3): 296-309,</ref>\n\nThe population reached 14,000 in 1790, but the decade was a rough one for the city. The Bank of England's suspension of specie payments caused the network of Atlantic credit to unravel, leading to a mild recession. The [[Quasi-War]] with France in 1798-1800 caused major disruptions to Baltimore's trade in the Caribbean. Finally, a yellow fever epidemic diverted ships from the port, while much of the urban population fled into the countryside. The downturn widened to include every social class and area of economic activity. In response the business community diversified away from an economy based heavily on foreign trade.<ref>Richard S.

Baltimore grew rapidly, becoming the largest city in the American South. It dominated the American flour trade after 1800 due to the milling technology of Oliver Evans, the introduction of steam power in processing, and the merchant-millers' development of drying processes which greatly slowed spoilage. Still, by 1830 [[New York City]]'s competition was felt keenly, and Baltimoreans were hard-pressed to match the merchantability standards despite more rigorous inspection controls than earlier, nor could they match the greater financial resources of their northern rivals.\n\nThe city was the site of the [[Battle of Baltimore]] during the [[War of 1812]]. After [[Burning of Washington|burning Washington, D.C.]], the British attacked Baltimore outside the eastern outskirts of town on the \"Patapsco Neck\" on September 12, at the [[Battle of North Point]], then on the night of September 13\u201314, 1814. United States forces from [[Fort McHenry]] successfully defended the city's harbor from the British.\n\n[[Francis Scott Key]], (1779\u20131843), a Maryland lawyer from [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown]] and [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], was aboard a British ship where he had been negotiating for the release of an American prisoner, Dr. [[William Beanes]]. Key witnessed the bombardment from this ship and after seeing the huge [[Star-Spangled Banner Flag|American flag]] on the morning of September 14, 1814, he wrote \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", a poem recounting the attack. Key's poem was set to a 1780 drinking song by British composer [[John Stafford Smith]], and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" became the official [[national anthem]] of the United States in 1931.\n\nA distinctive local culture started to take shape, and a unique skyline peppered with churches and monuments developed. Baltimore acquired its moniker \"The Monumental City\" after an 1827 visit to Baltimore by President [[John Quincy Adams]]. At an evening function Adams gave the following toast: \"Baltimore: the Monumental City\u2014May the days of her safety be as prosperous and happy, as the days of her dangers have been trying and triumphant.\"<ref name=\"salgaz\">{{Cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:EANX&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10C5DE501F137990&svc_dat=HistArchive:ahnpdoc&req_dat=0F418C809CE5EA70|title=Baltimore, October&nbsp;17|last=|first=|date=October 23, 1827|newspaper=|access-date=October 27, 2008|work=[[Salem Gaz.|Salem Gazette]]|location=Salem, Massachusetts|page=2|url-access=subscription |via=NewsBank}}</ref>\n\n===Finance===\nAlexander Brown (1764\u20131834), a Protestant immigrant from Ireland, came to the city in 1800 and set up a linen business with his sons. Soon the firm [[Alex. Brown & Sons]] moved into cotton and, to a lesser extent, shipping. Brown's sons opened branches in [[Liverpool]], Philadelphia, and New York. The firm was an enthusiastic supporter of the B&O Railroad. By 1850 it was the leading foreign exchange house in the United States. Brown was a business innovator who observed social conditions carefully and was a transition figure to the era after 1819 when cash and short credits became the norms of business relations. By concentrating his capital in small-risk ventures and acquiring ships and [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] stock during the [[Panic of 1819]], he came to monopolize Baltimore's shipping trade with Liverpool by 1822. Brown next expanded into packet ships, extended his lines to Philadelphia, and began financing Baltimore importers, specializing in merchant banking from the late 1820s to his death in 1834. The emergence of a money economy and the growth of the Anglo-American cotton trade allowed him to escape Baltimore's declining position in trans-Atlantic trade. His most important innovation was the drawing up of his own bills of exchange. By 1830 his company rivaled the Bank of the United States in the American foreign exchange markets, and the transition from the 'traditional' to the 'modern' merchant was nearly complete. It became the nation's first investment bank. It was sold in 1997, but the name lives on as [[Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown]], a division of the Germany's Deutsche Bank.<ref>Gary L.

In 1827, twenty-five merchants and bankers studied the best means of restoring \"that portion of the Western trade which has recently been diverted from it by the introduction of steam navigation.\" Their answer was to build a railroad\u2014one of the first commercial lines in the world. The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) became the first [[charter]]ed railroad in the United States; twenty thousand investors purchased $5 million in stock to import the rolling stock and build the line. It was a commercial and financial success, and invented many new managerial methods that became standard practice in railroading and modern business. The B&O became the first company to operate a [[steam locomotive|locomotive]] built in America, with the ''[[Tom Thumb (locomotive)|Tom Thumb]]'' in 1829. It built the first [[train station|passenger and freight station]] (Mount Clare in 1829) and was the first railroad that earned passenger revenues (December 1829), and published a timetable (May 23, 1830). On December 24, 1852, it became the first rail line to reach the [[Ohio River]] from the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]].<ref name=\"Dilts\">{{cite book |title=The Great Road: The Building of the Baltimore and Ohio, the Nation's First Railroad, 1828\u20131853 |last=Dilts |first=James D. |year=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Palo Alto, CA |isbn=978-0-8047-2629-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JjrCWPwvHzIC }}</ref> The railroad was merged into its former rival, the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O), to create \"The Chessie System Railroad.\"  The Chessie System merged with the Seaboard System Railroad to create [[CSX]] in 1987, with the letters \"CSX\" referring to \"Chessie,\" Seaboard,\" and \"much more to come.\"\n\nFollowing the B&O's start of regular operations in 1830, other railroads were built in the city.<ref name=\"Harwood\">{{cite book |title=Impossible Challenge II: Baltimore to Washington and Harpers Ferry from 1828 to 1994 |last=Harwood, Jr. |first=Herbert H. |year=1994 |publisher=Barnard, Roberts |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-934118-22-1 }}</ref>{{rp|27}} In the early 1830s the [[Baltimore and Port Deposit Rail Road]] began running trains in the [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] area, and later in the decade it reached [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]].<ref name=\"Harwood\" />{{rp|32}} Also in the 1830s, the [[Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad]] operated trains initially to [[Owings Mills, Maryland|Ownings Mills]], and later into [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"White\">{{cite book| last = White, Jr.| first = John H.| title = A history of the American locomotive: its development, 1830-1880| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1A4iiGAz628C| year = 1980| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| location = Mineola, NY| isbn = 978-0-486-23818-0 }}</ref>{{rp|168}} Both lines were later controlled by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].

Slavery in Maryland declined steadily after the 1810s as the state's economy shifted away from plantation agriculture, as evangelicalism and a liberal [[manumission]] law encouraged slaveholders to free enslaved people held in bondage, and as other slaveholders practiced \"term slavery,\" registering deeds of manumission but postponing the actual date of freedom for a decade or more. Baltimore's shrinking population of enslaved people often lived and worked alongside the city's growing free black population as \"quasi-freedmen.\" With unskilled and semiskilled employment readily available in the shipyards and related industries, little friction with white workers occurred. Despite the overall poverty of the city's free blacks, compared with the condition of those living in Philadelphia, Charleston, and [[New Orleans]], Baltimore was a \"city of refuge,\" where enslaved and free blacks alike found an unusual amount of freedom. Churches, schools, and fraternal and benevolent associations provided a cushion against hardening white attitudes toward free people of color in the wake of [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|Nat Turner's revolt]] in Virginia in 1831. But a flood of [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|German]] and [[Irish American|Irish]] immigrants swamped Baltimore's labor market after 1840, driving free blacks deeper into poverty.<ref>Christopher Phillips ''Freedom's Port: The African American Community of Baltimore, 1791-1860'' (1997)</ref>\n\nThe Maryland Chemical Works of Baltimore used a mix of free labor, hired slave labor, and enslaved people held by the corporation to work in its factory.<ref>{{cite book|title=Maryland History In Prints 1743-1900|first=Laura|last=Rice|page=77}}</ref> Since chemicals needed constant attention, the rapid turnover of free white labor encouraged the owner to use enslaved workers. While slave labor was about 20 percent cheaper, the company began to reduce its dependence on enslaved labor in 1829 when two slaves ran away and one died.<ref>T. Stephen Whitman, \"Industrial Slavery at the Margin: the Maryland Chemical Works,\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 1993 59(1): 31-62,</ref>\n\nThe location of Baltimore in a border state created opportunities for enslaved people in the city to run away and find freedom in the north\u2014as [[Frederick Douglass]] did. Therefore, slaveholders in Baltimore frequently turned to gradual manumission as a means to secure dependable and productive labor from slaves. In promising freedom after a fixed period of years, slaveholders intended to reduce the costs associated with lifetime servitude while providing slaves incentive for cooperation. Enslaved people tried to negotiate terms of manumission that were more advantageous, and the implicit threat of flight weighed significantly in slaveholders' calculations. The dramatic decrease in the enslaved population during 1850-60 indicates that slavery was no longer profitable in the city. Slaves were still used as expensive house servants: it was cheaper to hire a free worker by the day, with the option of dropping him or replacing him with a better worker, rather than run the expense of maintaining a slave month in and month out with little flexibility.<ref>Stephen Whitman,  \"Manumission and the Transformation of Urban Slavery,\" ''Social Science History'' 1995 19(3): 333-370</ref>\n\nOn the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Baltimore had the largest free black community in the nation. About 15 schools for black people were operating, including Sabbath schools operated by Methodists, Presbyterians, and Quakers, along with several private academies. All black schools were self-sustaining, receiving no state or local government funds, and whites in Baltimore generally opposed educating the black population, continuing to tax black property holders to maintain schools from which black children were excluded by law. Baltimore's black community, nevertheless, was one of the largest and most divided in America due to this experience.<ref name=\"Collier-Thomas\">{{cite book |last=Collier-Thomas |first=Bettye |authorlink= |title=The Baltimore Black Community, 1865-1910 |url= |accessdate= |year=1974 |publisher=George Washington University |location=Washington, DC |isbn= |page= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Know-Nothing Party and Baltimore politics===\nBaltimore in the [[Third Party System]] had two-party competitive elections, with powerful bosses, carefully orchestrated political violence, and an emerging working-class consciousness at the polls. The fierce politics of the 1850s had galvanized the white workers, most of them German, who opposed slavery. The American Party emerged in the mid-1850s to represent Protestants and to counter the Democratic Party, which was increasingly controlled by [[Catholic Irish]]. When Baltimore erupted in violence at the time of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s 1861 inauguration, for example, the pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] \"Blood Tubs\" that took to the streets were veterans of political rioting. The nativist American ([[Know-Nothing]]) Party captured the Baltimore government in 1854. The party promoted modernization, including professionalizing police and fire departments, expanding the courts, and upgrading the water supply.<ref>Frank Towers, \"Mobtown\" (2012) p 470</ref> The party used [[Spoils system|patronage]] and, especially, coercion and election-day violence; its armed gangs scared off Democratic voters, but the Irish and Germans fought back. Voters elected a congressman and governor nominated by the party during its short life. In 1860 the Democrat-controlled legislature took back the city police, the [[state militia|militia]], patronage, and the electoral machinery, and prosecuted some Know-Nothings for electoral fraud. By 1861 the Know-Nothings had split over secession.<ref name=\"Towers\">{{cite book |last=Towers |first=Frank |authorlink= |title=The Urban South and the Coming of the Civil War |url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville, VA |isbn=0-8139-2297-6 |page= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Baltimore during and after the Civil War: 1861\u20141894 ==\n\n===Civil War===\n[[File:Baltimore Riot 1861.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Baltimore riot of 1861]]]]\nThe Civil War divided Baltimore and Maryland's residents. Much of the social and political elite favored the Confederacy\u2014and indeed owned house slaves. In the 1860 election the city's large German element voted not for Lincoln but for Southern Democrat [[John C. Breckinridge]]. They were less concerned with the abolition of slavery, an issue emphasized by Republicans, and much more with nativism, temperance, and religious beliefs, associated with the Know-Nothing Party and strongly opposed by the Democrats. However the Germans hated slavery and supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref name=\"Towers\" />\n\nWhen [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers from the [[6th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia|6th Massachusetts Militia]] and some unarmed [[Pennsylvania National Guard|Pennsylvania state militia]] known as the \"Washington Brigade\" from [[Philadelphia]] with their band marched through the city at the start of the war, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers attacked the troops, which led to the first bloodshed in the Civil War during the [[Baltimore riot of 1861]]. Four soldiers and twelve civilians were killed during the riot, which caused Union troops to later occupy Baltimore in May under Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] of Massachusetts. Maryland came under direct federal administration\u2014in part, to prevent the state from seceding\u2014until the end of the war in April 1865.\n\nWhen Massachusetts troops marched through the city on April 19, 1861, en route to [[Washington, D.C.]], a [[Baltimore riot of 1861|rebel mob attacked]]; 4 soldiers and 12 rioters were dead, and 36 soldiers and uncounted rioters had been injured. Governor [[Thomas Holliday Hicks|Thomas Hicks]] realized action needed to be taken. He convened a special session of the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly]] but moved its location to a site in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], a distance from the secessionist groups. In doing this and by other actions, Hicks managed to neutralize the General Assembly to avoid Maryland's secession from the Union, becoming a hero in the eyes of the Unionists in the state. Meanwhile, pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] gangs burned the bridges connecting Baltimore and Washington to the North, and cut the telegraph lines. Lincoln sent in federal troops under Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Ben Butler]]; they seized the city, imposed [[martial law]], and arrested leading Confederate spokesmen. The prisoners were later released and the rail lines reopened, making Baltimore a major Union base during the war.<ref>Browne, ''Baltimore in the Nation, 1789-1861'' (1980); Sheads and Toomey, ''Baltimore during the Civil War'' (1997).</ref>\n\n===African Americans after the Civil War===\nMaryland was not subject to [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], but the end of slavery meant heightened racial tensions as free blacks flocked to the city and many armed confrontations erupted between blacks and whites. Rural blacks who flocked to Baltimore created increased competition for skilled jobs and upset the prewar relationship between free blacks and whites. As black migrants were relegated to unskilled work or no work at all, violent strikes erupted. Denied entry into the regular state militia, armed blacks formed militias of their own. In the midst of this change, white Baltimoreans interpreted black discontent as disrespect for law and order, which justified police repression.<ref>Richard Paul Fuke,  \"Blacks, Whites, and Guns: Interracial Violence in Post-emancipation Maryland,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1997 92(3): 326-347</ref>\n[[File:Sharp Street Memorial United Methodist Church and Community House.jpg|alt=Photograph of Sharp Street Church on Dolphin Street|thumb|Sharp Street Church was established 1787 and erected existing building in 1898]]\nBaltimore had a larger population of African Americans than any northern city. The new Maryland state constitution of 1864 ended slavery and provided for the education of all children, including blacks. The Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of the Colored People established schools for blacks that were taken over by the public school system, which then restricted education for blacks beginning in 1867 when Democrats regained control of the city. Establishing an unequal system that prepared white students for citizenship while using education to reinforce black subjugation, Baltimore's postwar school system exposed the contradictions of race, education, and republicanism in an age when African Americans struggled to realize the ostensible freedoms gained by emancipation.<ref>Robert S. Wolff, \"The Problem of Race in the Age of Freedom: Emancipation and the Transformation of Republican Schooling in Baltimore, 1860-1867,\" ''Civil War History'' 2006 52(3): 229-254</ref> Thus blacks found themselves forced to support [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] legislation and urged that the \"colored schools\" be staffed only with black teachers. From 1867 to 1900 black schools grew from 10 to 27 and enrollment from 901 to 9,383. The Mechanical and Industrial Association achieved success only in 1892 with the opening of the Colored Manual Training School. Black leaders were convinced by the Rev. William Alexander and his newspaper, the ''[[Baltimore Afro-American|Afro American]]'', that economic advancement and first-class citizenship depended on equal access to schools.<ref name=\"Collier-Thomas\" />\n\n===Economic growth===\n[[File:Baltimore Street Map, 1892.jpg|thumb|Baltimore Street Map, 1892]]\nBy 1880 manufacturing replaced trade and made the city a nationally important industrial center. The port continued to ship increasing amounts of grain, flour, tobacco, and raw cotton to Europe. The new industries of men's clothing, canning, tin and sheet-iron ware products, foundry and machine shop products, cars, and tobacco manufacture had the largest labor force and largest product value.<ref>Eleanor S. Bruchey,  \"The Development of Baltimore Business, 1880-1914,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1969 64(1): 18-42</ref>\n\nThe construction of new housing was a major factor in Baltimore's economy. Vill (1986) examines the activities of major builders between 1869 and 1896, especially as they gained access to building land and capital. Most, but not all, of the major builders were craftsmen who were entrepreneurs compared with others in the building trades, but were still small businessmen who built small numbers of houses during long careers. They worked with landowners, and both groups manipulated the city's leasehold system to their own advantage. Builders obtained credit from a diverse array of sources, including sellers of land, building societies, and land companies. The most important source was individual lenders, who lent money in small amounts either on their own account or through lawyers and trustees overseeing funds held in trust. In spite of their important role in shaping the city, the contractors were small businessmen who rarely achieved citywide visibility.<ref>Martha J. Vill, \"Building Enterprise in Late Nineteenth-Century Baltimore,\" ''Journal of Historical Geograph'' 1986 12(2): 162-181,</ref> Until the 1890s, Baltimore remained a patchwork of nationalities with white natives, [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|German]] and [[History of the Irish in Baltimore|Irish immigrants]], and [[African Americans in Maryland|black Baltimoreans]] scattered throughout the 'social quilt' in heterogeneous neighborhoods.\n\n[[File:Sixth Maryland Regiment firing on the rioters in Baltimore.png|thumb|240px|[[Baltimore railroad strike of 1877]]]]\nBaltimore was the origin of a major [[Baltimore railroad strike of 1877|railroad workers' strike in 1877]] when the B&O company attempted to lower wages. On July 20, 1877, Maryland Governor [[John Lee Carroll]] called up the 5th and 6th Regiments of the [[Maryland Army National Guard|National Guard]] to end the strikes, which had disrupted train service at [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]] in western Maryland. Citizens sympathetic to the railroad workers attacked the National Guard troops as they marched from their armories in Baltimore to [[Camden Station]]. Soldiers from the 6th Regiment fired on the crowd, killing 10 and wounding 25. Rioters then damaged B&O trains and burned portions of the rail station. Order was restored in the city on July 21\u201322 when federal troops arrived to protect railroad property and end the strike.\n\n===YWCA===\nExpanded economic activity brought many immigrants from the countryside and from Europe after the Civil War. Concerns for young, single Protestant women alone in cities led to the growth of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA) movement. When the Baltimore YWCA was founded in 1883, they only offered their services to white women and so the Colored Women's YWCA was founded in 1896. They merged in 1920.<ref>{{cite|title=YWCA Greater Baltimore: Our History|url=http://www.ywcagreaterbaltimore.org/index.php/about/history|publisher=YWCA Greater Baltimore|accessdate=12 Apr 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Progressive Era: 1895\u20141928==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Population growth and decline\n|-\n!

The Rebuilding of Baltimore |pages=249ff}}</ref> Baltimore was a poorly managed city in 1890, despite its economic vitality. Already [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], and New York were moving to modernize their [[public works]] infrastructures and to support the construction of [[capital-intensive]], technologically sophisticated [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]] and [[water supply]] systems. Baltimore lagged behind the other American metropolises because of its culture of privatism and the politicization of its municipal administration. However, during the 1890-1920 period the city responded to the same concerns as Chicago, New York, and Boston. The increase in urban crises, particularly the 1904 fire and the deterioration of sanitary conditions, prompted demands for reform. Moreover, the municipal administration underwent a process of moralization and professionalization in the 20th century. Afterward, Baltimore modeled itself on the other American metropolises and chose to modernize its institutions and address the industrial and urban challenges of the era.<ref>{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Alan D. |authorlink= |title=The Origin and Resolution of an Urban Crisis: Baltimore, 1890-1930 |series=Johns Hopkins studies in urban affairs |url=https://archive.org/details/originresolution0000ande |accessdate= |year=1977 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=9780801819704 |page= |pages= |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n===Park planning===\nThe story of the Patapsco Forest Reserve (later renamed the [[Patapsco Valley State Park]]) near Baltimore reveals notable connections between the Progressive-era movements for forest conservation and urban park planning. In 1903, the Patapsco Valley site, although outside the city boundary, was nevertheless identified by the Olmstead Brothers landscape architecture firm as an ideal site to acquire property for future park development. At the same time, the Maryland State Board of Forestry, seeking to establish scientific forestry research, received donated land for this purpose in the Patapsco Valley. Over subsequent decades, a powerful alliance of urban elites, state managers, and city officials assembled thousands of acres along the Patapsco River. The site evolved into a unique hybrid of forest preserve and public park that reflected both its location on the urban fringe and its dual heritage in the conservation and parks movements.<ref>Geoffrey L. Buckley, et al. \"The Patapsco Forest Reserve: Establishing a 'City Park' for Baltimore, 1907-1941,\" ''Historical Geography'' 2006 34: 87-108</ref>\n\n===Baseball===\nWhen in 1918 the US government reversed its draft exemption for married workers and required all men to work in essential occupations or serve in the military, professional baseball players either enlisted or joined industrial baseball leagues. Company leagues included those of [[Bethlehem Steel]], which had recreational leagues on both coasts that by 1918 represented a major-league level of competition. [[Sparrows Point, Maryland]], a Bethlehem Steel company town, had a Steel League team, whose results Baltimore baseball fans followed closely. At the same time, fans also followed the draft status and 1918 season of Baltimore native [[Babe Ruth]], then playing with the Boston Red Sox and considering his own options, including joining an industrial league team. In September Bethlehem Steel, fearing competition with other leagues over professional talent, disbanded the Steel League. When the war ended in November, players such as Ruth were free to re-sign with their major league teams.<ref>Peter T. Dalleo, and J. Vincent Watchorn, III, \"Baltimore, the 'Babe,' and the Bethlehem Steel League, 1918,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1998 93(1): 88-106,</ref>\n\n==Depression and War: 1929\u20141949==\nArgersinger (1988) describes the loss of power by traditional Democratic leaders and organizations in Baltimore under the [[New Deal]]. The old-line Democrats operated in the spirit of traditional political bosses who dispensed the patronage. They were, at best, lukewarm Roosevelt supporters because the New Deal threatened their monopoly on patronage. Blacks, other ethnic groups, labor, and other former supporters turned from their patrons to other leadership. Baltimore Mayor Howard W. Jackson's support gradually eroded until he was defeated in a gubernatorial primary election to choose an opponent for a Republican who earlier defeated Governor Albert C. Richie, a conservative Democrat.<ref>Jo Ann E.  Argersinger, ''Toward a New Deal in Baltimore: People and Government in the Great Depression'' (1988)</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Construction of aircraft at the Glenn L. Martin plant at Baltimore, MD. Machine gun turrets are completely assembled... - NARA - 520744.jpg|thumb|Worker assembling an aircraft at the Glenn L. Martin plant in Baltimore]]\nBaltimore was a major war production center in [[World War II]]. The biggest operations were Bethlehem Steel's Fairfield Yard, on the southeastern edge of the harbor, which built Liberty ships; its work force peaked at 46,700 in late 1943. Even larger was [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Glenn Martin]], an aircraft plant located {{convert|10|mi|km}} northeast of downtown. By late 1943 about 150,000 to 200,000 migrant war workers had arrived. They were predominantly poor white southerners; most came from the hills of Virginia, [[North Carolina]], [[West Virginia]], Pennsylvania, [[Kentucky]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Tennessee]]. War mobilization brought federal pressure to unionize the work force, and by 1941 the leftist [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] had organized most of Baltimore's large industries, while the more conservative [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] also gained many new members. By 1945, labor unions and ethnics had taken over local politics and liberal mayors enjoyed black as well as white support. The machine was led by Italian Catholic politicians such as [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s father, [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.]], who was mayor in 1947\u201359; her brother, [[Thomas D'Alesandro III]], was mayor from 1967 to 1971.<ref>Pelosi married and moved to San Francisco in the late 1960s.</ref>\n\n[[John Francis Cronin|Father John F. Cronin]]'s early confrontations with Communists in the World War II-era labor movement turned him into a leading anti-Communist in the Catholic Church and the US government during the [[Cold War]]. Father Cronin, then a prominent Catholic parish priest, saw a united labor movement as central to his moderate, reformist vision for Baltimore's social ills, and worked closely with anti-Communist labor leaders.<ref>Joshua B. Freeman, and Steve Rosswurm, \"The Education of an Anti-Communist: Father John F. Cronin and the Baltimore Labor Movement,\" ''Labor History'' 1992 33(2): 217-247</ref>\n\n==Cold War era==\nIn 1950, the city's population topped out at 950,000 people, of whom 24 percent were black. Then the [[white flight|white movement to the suburbs]] began in earnest, and the population inside the city limits steadily declined and became proportionately more black.\n\n===Schools===\nIntegration of [[Baltimore City Public Schools|Baltimore's public schools]] at first went smoothly, as city elites suppressed working class white complaints, as white families migrated to suburban school systems. By the 1970s new problems had surfaced. Formerly white schools had become mostly black schools, though whites still made up most of the faculty and administration. Worse, the school system had become dependent on federal funding. In 1974, these circumstances led to two dramatic incidents. A teachers' strike highlighted the city's unwillingness to raise teachers' salaries because a hike in property taxes would further alienate white residents. A second crisis revolved around a federally mandated desegregation plan that also threatened to alienate the remaining white residents. \n\n===Drugs===\n[[Heroin]] supply and use in Baltimore rose explosively in the 1960s, following a trend of rising drug use across the United States. In the late 1940s there were only a few dozen African-American heroin addicts in the Pennsylvania Avenue area of the city. Heroin use began largely for reasons of prestige within a group that most middle-class blacks looked down on. When the Baltimore police formed the three-man narcotics squad in 1951 there was only moderate profit in drug dealing and shoplifting was the addict's crime of choice. By the late 1950s young whites were using the drug, and by 1960 there were over one thousand heroin addicts in the police files; this figure doubled in the 1960s. A generation of profiteering young, violent black dealers took over in the 1960s as violence increased and the price of heroin skyrocketed. Increasing drug usage was the primary reason for burglaries rising tenfold and robberies rising thirtyfold from 1950 to 1970. Soaring numbers of broken homes and Baltimore's declining economic status probably exacerbated the drug problem. Adolescents in suburban areas began using drugs in the late 1960s.<ref>Jill Jonnes, \"Everybody Must Get Stoned: The Origins Of Modern Drug Culture In Baltimore,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1996 91(2): 132-155</ref>\n\n===Civil rights===\nIn the 1930s and 1940s the local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], the black churches, and the ''Afro-American'' weekly newspaper took charge of organizing and publicizing demonstrations. There was no rioting.\n\n[[Read's Drug Store]] in Baltimore was the site of one of the nation's earliest [[sit-in]]s in January 1955.

The churches were instrumental in keeping lines of communication open between the geographically and politically divided middle-class and poor blacks, a chasm that had widened since the end of World War II. Ministers formed a network across churches and denominations and did much of the face-to-face work of motivating people to organize and protest. In many cases they also adopted King's theology of justice and freedom and altered their preaching styles.<ref>David Milobsky, \"Power from the Pulpit: Baltimore's African-American Clergy, 1950-1970,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine' '1994 89(3): 274-289,</ref>\n\n===1968 unrest===\n{{main|Baltimore riot of 1968|King assassination riots}}\nUnrest in the black inner-city exploded for four nights in April 1968, after news arrived of the assassination of the Reverend [[Martin Luther King]] in Memphis Tennessee.<ref>Peter B.

That was not enough, so President Lyndon Johnson, at the governor's request, sent in 6,000 U.S. Army combat troops to finally regain control of the city.

White Southerners came to Baltimore for factory jobs during World War II, permanently altering the city's political landscape. The new arrivals approved of the segregated system that had been in effect since the early 20th century. Working whites mobilized to prevent school integration after the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision of the Supreme Court in 1954. They believed that their interests were being sacrificed to those of black Americans. As working-class whites began to feel increasingly embattled in the face of federal intervention into local practices, many turned to the 1964 presidential primary campaign of [[George Wallace]] who swept the white working class vote. Durr (2003) explains the defection of white working-class voters in Baltimore to the Republican Party as being caused by their fears that the Democratic Party's desegregation policies posed a threat to their families, workplaces, and neighborhoods.<ref>Kenneth Durr, \"When Southern Politics Came North: the Roots of White Working-class Conservatism in Baltimore, 1940-1964,\" ''Labor History'' (1996) 37#3 pp: 309-331; Durr, ''Behind the Backlash: White Working-Class Politics in Baltimore, 1940-1980'' (2003)</ref>\n\nBetween 1950 and 1990, Baltimore's population declined by more than 200,000.

Important bishops include [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] (1735\u20131815, in office 1789-1815), [[Francis Kenrick]] (1796\u20131863, in office 1851-65), and especially Cardinal [[James Gibbons]] (1834\u20141921, in office 1877-1921).\n\nIn 1806-21 Catholics constructed the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, based on a neoclassical design by architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]]. The church completed a $34-million restoration based on Latrobe's original plans in 2006.\n\nDuring 1948\u201361, the Archdiocese of Baltimore was under the leadership of [[Francis Patrick Keough]]. The Baltimore Church identified with the anti-Communist and anti-pornography movements and with the expansion of Catholic institutions that addressed a myriad of social, economic, and educational issues. The Church also coordinated a multitude of action projects under the financial control of the Baltimore chancery.<ref>Spalding (1989)</ref>\n\n===Methodists===\nThe Methodists were well received in Maryland in the 1760-1840 era, and Baltimore became an important center.<ref>Dee E. Andrews, ''The Methodists and Revolutionary America, 1760-1800: The Shaping of an Evangelical Culture'' (2000)</ref> Sutton (1998) looks at Methodist artisans and craftsmen, showing they embraced an evangelical identity, Protestant ethic, and complex organizational structure. This enabled them to express their anti-elitist or populist \"producerist\" values of self-discipline, honesty, frugality, and industry; they denounced greed, and sought an interdependent common good. Such producerist views drew on aspects of the Wesleyan ethic, appropriated the commonweal traditions of 18th-century [[republicanism]], and initially resisted those of classical liberal, individualistic, self-interested capitalism. They also accorded well with and helped produce the emerging amalgam of American populist, restorationist, biblicistic, revivalistic activism that Sutton terms \"Arminianized Calvinism.\"<ref name=\"Sutton\">{{cite book |last=Sutton |first=William R. |authorlink= |title=Journeymen for Jesus: Evangelical Artisans Confront Capitalism in Jacksonian Baltimore |url= |accessdate= |year=1998 |publisher=Penn State Press |location= |isbn=9780271044125 |page= |pages=}}</ref>\n\nInside the Methodist Church the artisans were reformers who focused on three substantive and symbolic targets, each of which would democratize Methodist conferences: lay suffrage and representation; inclusion of the local preachers, who constituted two-thirds of Methodist leadership; and election of the officers who carried the administrative, personnel, and supervisory power, the presiding elders. The appeals made on behalf of these democratizations, Sutton shows, drew imaginatively on both producerist and Wesleyan rhetoric. By the 1850s, Sutton (1998) shows that the corporate ideals and individual disciplines of religious producerism were expressed in trade unionism, in evangelical missions to workers, in factory preaching, in workers' congregations, in temperance and Sabbatarianism, in the Sunday school movement, and in the politics of Protestant communal hegemony.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />\n\n===Baptists===\nThe Appalachians and southern whites arriving in the 1940s brought along a strong religious tradition with them.

The following year, shipwright Charles Gorsuch settled Whetstone Point, the present location of [[Fort McHenry]]. In 1665, the west side of the Jones Falls on the Inner Harbor was settled when 550 acres of land, thereafter named Cole's Harbor, was granted to Thomas Cole and later sold to David Jones in 1679. [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Old Saint Paul's Parish]] of [[Baltimore County]] was one of the \"Original Thirty\" parishes designated for the Colony. It included the county of Baltimore and future Baltimore Town and was part of the \"established\" or \"state\" [[Church of England]], also known as the [[Anglican Church]]. It was the first church built in the metro area, erected in 1692 on the Patapsco Neck peninsula in southeastern Baltimore County, along the [[Colgate Creek]] which flowed into the [[Patapsco River]] (present site of today's [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]] Marine Terminal of the [[Port of Baltimore]]). Jones's stepson James Todd resurveyed Cole's Harbor in 1696. The tract was renamed Todd's Range, which was then sold off in progressively smaller parcels, thereby forming the land that would become the Town of Baltimore thirty years later.\n\nAnother \"Baltimore\" existed on the Bush River as early as 1674.

The exact location of Old Baltimore was lost for years. It was certain that the location was somewhere on the site of the present-day [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] (APG), a U.S. Army testing facility. in the 1990s, APG's Cultural Resource Management Program took up the task of finding Old Baltimore. The firm of R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates was contracted for the project.

Regardless, the King still gave his heir Cecil the 1632 grant for the Maryland colony, named after Charles's wife, Queen [[Henrietta Marie]].

Unlike many other towns established around that time, Baltimore was more than just existence on paper. [[German American|German immigrants]] began to settle along the [[Chesapeake Bay]] by 1723, living in the Baltimore area. The General Assembly enlarged Baltimore Town in 1745 and incorporated David Jones's original settlement known as Jones Town. Baltimore sent representatives to the Assembly, and over the next two decades it acquired nine parcels of land and annexed neighboring villages including Fells Point to become an important community on the head of the [[Patapsco River]]. As the Town grew, increasing numbers of German Lutheran immigrants established [[Zion Lutheran Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Zion Church]] in 1755, and later also a German Reformed congregation was organized as the first among the [[Protestant]]s to be represented which also attracted more of these \"[[Pennsylvania Dutch]]\" settlers to the region. Early German settlers also later established the [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|German Society of Maryland]] in 1783 in order to foster the German language and German culture in Baltimore.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.immigrationbaltimore.org/historical_timeline.htm |title= Significant dates in Baltimore's immigration history |publisher= Baltimore Immigration Memorial Foundation |accessdate= 2012-08-20 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130111231058/http://www.immigrationbaltimore.org/historical_timeline.htm |archive-date= 2013-01-11 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Mount Clare Mansion - Front angle.jpg|alt=View of the front of Mount Clare Mansion.|thumb|[[Mount Clare (Maryland)|Mount Clare Mansion]], known today as the Mount Clare Museum House, is the oldest Colonial-era structure in Baltimore.]]\nThroughout the 18th Century, Baltimore drained and filled in marshes (notably Thomas \"Harrison's Marsh\" along the Jones Falls west bank), built canals around the falls and through the center of town, built bridges across the Falls and annexed neighboring [[Jonestown, Baltimore|Jones's Town]] to the northeast in 1745 and expanded southeastward towards the neighboring, bustling, shipbuilding port at [[Fells Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]]. It became by far the largest city in the Middle Atlantic colonies between [[Philadelphia]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. A political deal by the increasingly powerful financial interests in the growing town and with the rapidly growing population, was reached and the county seat with its important center of a courthouse for all Baltimore County was moved from Old Joppa over its citizens enraged protests. Baltimoreans paid some 300 pounds sterling the next year to erect a fine brick courthouse with a bell tower and steeple on a Courthouse Square (future Calvert Street, between East Lexington and Fayette Streets) along with the necessary \"whipping post\", [[stocks]] (for confining heads and arms), podium for making public announcements and news, and a nearby jail, on the northern hills overlooking the harbor basin and with its back sitting over a rugged cliff and bluffs to the northeast with \"Steiger's Meadow\" bordering the twisting loop of the [[Jones Falls]] which bended southwestward before running north again.\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], the [[Second Continental Congress]] temporarily fled from Philadelphia and held sessions in Baltimore between December 1776 and February 1777. When the Continental Congress authorized the privateering of British vessels, eager Baltimore merchants accepted the challenge, and as the war progressed, the shipbuilding industry expanded and boomed. There was no major military action near the city though, except for the passing nearby and a feint towards the town by the British [[Royal Navy]] fleet as they headed north up the Chesapeake Bay to land an army at [[Elkton, Maryland|Head of Elk]] in the northeast corner to march on the American capital at [[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and the following battles at [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]] and [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]].\n\nThe American Revolution stimulated the domestic market for wheat and iron ore, and in Baltimore flour milling increased along the [[Jones Falls|Jones]] and [[Gwynns Falls]]. Iron ore transport greatly boosted the local economy. The British naval blockade hurt Baltimore's shipping, but also freed merchants and traders from British debts, which along with the capture of British merchant vessels furthered Baltimore's economic growth. By 1800 Baltimore had become one of the major cities of the new republic.<ref>Garrett Power,  \"Parceling out Land in the Vicinity of Baltimore: 1632-1796, Part 2,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1993 88(2): 150-180,</ref>\n\nThe economic foundations laid down between 1763 and 1776 were vital to the even greater expansion seen during the Revolutionary War. Though still lagging behind Philadelphia, Baltimore merchants and entrepreneurs produced an expanding commercial community with family businesses and partnerships proliferating in shipping, the flour-milling and grain business, and the indentured servant traffic. International trade focused on four areas: Britain, Southern Europe, the West Indies, and the North American coastal towns. Credit was the essence of the system and a virtual chain of indebtedness meant that bills remained long unpaid and little cash was used among overseas correspondents, merchant wholesalers, and retail customers. Bills of exchange were used extensively, often circulating as currency. Frequent crises of credit, and the wars with France kept prices and markets in constant flux, but men such as William Lux and the Christie brothers produced a maturing economy and a thriving metropolis by the 1770s.<ref>Paul K.  Walker, \"Business and Commerce in Baltimore on the Eve of Independence,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1976 71(3): 296-309,</ref>\n\nThe population reached 14,000 in 1790, but the decade was a rough one for the city. The Bank of England's suspension of specie payments caused the network of Atlantic credit to unravel, leading to a mild recession. The [[Quasi-War]] with France in 1798-1800 caused major disruptions to Baltimore's trade in the Caribbean. Finally, a yellow fever epidemic diverted ships from the port, while much of the urban population fled into the countryside. The downturn widened to include every social class and area of economic activity. In response the business community diversified away from an economy based heavily on foreign trade.<ref>Richard S.

Baltimore grew rapidly, becoming the largest city in the American South. It dominated the American flour trade after 1800 due to the milling technology of Oliver Evans, the introduction of steam power in processing, and the merchant-millers' development of drying processes which greatly slowed spoilage. Still, by 1830 [[New York City]]'s competition was felt keenly, and Baltimoreans were hard-pressed to match the merchantability standards despite more rigorous inspection controls than earlier, nor could they match the greater financial resources of their northern rivals.\n\nThe city was the site of the [[Battle of Baltimore]] during the [[War of 1812]]. After [[Burning of Washington|burning Washington, D.C.]], the British attacked Baltimore outside the eastern outskirts of town on the \"Patapsco Neck\" on September 12, at the [[Battle of North Point]], then on the night of September 13\u201314, 1814. United States forces from [[Fort McHenry]] successfully defended the city's harbor from the British.\n\n[[Francis Scott Key]], (1779\u20131843), a Maryland lawyer from [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown]] and [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], was aboard a British ship where he had been negotiating for the release of an American prisoner, Dr. [[William Beanes]]. Key witnessed the bombardment from this ship and after seeing the huge [[Star-Spangled Banner Flag|American flag]] on the morning of September 14, 1814, he wrote \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", a poem recounting the attack. Key's poem was set to a 1780 drinking song by British composer [[John Stafford Smith]], and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" became the official [[national anthem]] of the United States in 1931.\n\nA distinctive local culture started to take shape, and a unique skyline peppered with churches and monuments developed. Baltimore acquired its moniker \"The Monumental City\" after an 1827 visit to Baltimore by President [[John Quincy Adams]]. At an evening function Adams gave the following toast: \"Baltimore: the Monumental City\u2014May the days of her safety be as prosperous and happy, as the days of her dangers have been trying and triumphant.\"<ref name=\"salgaz\">{{Cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:EANX&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10C5DE501F137990&svc_dat=HistArchive:ahnpdoc&req_dat=0F418C809CE5EA70|title=Baltimore, October&nbsp;17|last=|first=|date=October 23, 1827|newspaper=|access-date=October 27, 2008|work=[[Salem Gaz.|Salem Gazette]]|location=Salem, Massachusetts|page=2|url-access=subscription |via=NewsBank}}</ref>\n\n===Finance===\nAlexander Brown (1764\u20131834), a Protestant immigrant from Ireland, came to the city in 1800 and set up a linen business with his sons. Soon the firm [[Alex. Brown & Sons]] moved into cotton and, to a lesser extent, shipping. Brown's sons opened branches in [[Liverpool]], Philadelphia, and New York. The firm was an enthusiastic supporter of the B&O Railroad. By 1850 it was the leading foreign exchange house in the United States. Brown was a business innovator who observed social conditions carefully and was a transition figure to the era after 1819 when cash and short credits became the norms of business relations. By concentrating his capital in small-risk ventures and acquiring ships and [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] stock during the [[Panic of 1819]], he came to monopolize Baltimore's shipping trade with Liverpool by 1822. Brown next expanded into packet ships, extended his lines to Philadelphia, and began financing Baltimore importers, specializing in merchant banking from the late 1820s to his death in 1834. The emergence of a money economy and the growth of the Anglo-American cotton trade allowed him to escape Baltimore's declining position in trans-Atlantic trade. His most important innovation was the drawing up of his own bills of exchange. By 1830 his company rivaled the Bank of the United States in the American foreign exchange markets, and the transition from the 'traditional' to the 'modern' merchant was nearly complete. It became the nation's first investment bank. It was sold in 1997, but the name lives on as [[Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown]], a division of the Germany's Deutsche Bank.<ref>Gary L.

In 1827, twenty-five merchants and bankers studied the best means of restoring \"that portion of the Western trade which has recently been diverted from it by the introduction of steam navigation.\" Their answer was to build a railroad\u2014one of the first commercial lines in the world. The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) became the first [[charter]]ed railroad in the United States; twenty thousand investors purchased $5 million in stock to import the rolling stock and build the line. It was a commercial and financial success, and invented many new managerial methods that became standard practice in railroading and modern business. The B&O became the first company to operate a [[steam locomotive|locomotive]] built in America, with the ''[[Tom Thumb (locomotive)|Tom Thumb]]'' in 1829. It built the first [[train station|passenger and freight station]] (Mount Clare in 1829) and was the first railroad that earned passenger revenues (December 1829), and published a timetable (May 23, 1830). On December 24, 1852, it became the first rail line to reach the [[Ohio River]] from the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]].<ref name=\"Dilts\">{{cite book |title=The Great Road: The Building of the Baltimore and Ohio, the Nation's First Railroad, 1828\u20131853 |last=Dilts |first=James D. |year=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Palo Alto, CA |isbn=978-0-8047-2629-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JjrCWPwvHzIC }}</ref> The railroad was merged into its former rival, the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O), to create \"The Chessie System Railroad.\"  The Chessie System merged with the Seaboard System Railroad to create [[CSX]] in 1987, with the letters \"CSX\" referring to \"Chessie,\" Seaboard,\" and \"much more to come.\"\n\nFollowing the B&O's start of regular operations in 1830, other railroads were built in the city.<ref name=\"Harwood\">{{cite book |title=Impossible Challenge II: Baltimore to Washington and Harpers Ferry from 1828 to 1994 |last=Harwood, Jr. |first=Herbert H. |year=1994 |publisher=Barnard, Roberts |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-934118-22-1 }}</ref>{{rp|27}} In the early 1830s the [[Baltimore and Port Deposit Rail Road]] began running trains in the [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] area, and later in the decade it reached [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]].<ref name=\"Harwood\" />{{rp|32}} Also in the 1830s, the [[Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad]] operated trains initially to [[Owings Mills, Maryland|Ownings Mills]], and later into [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"White\">{{cite book| last = White, Jr.| first = John H.| title = A history of the American locomotive: its development, 1830-1880| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1A4iiGAz628C| year = 1980| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| location = Mineola, NY| isbn = 978-0-486-23818-0 }}</ref>{{rp|168}} Both lines were later controlled by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].

Slavery in Maryland declined steadily after the 1810s as the state's economy shifted away from plantation agriculture, as evangelicalism and a liberal [[manumission]] law encouraged slaveholders to free enslaved people held in bondage, and as other slaveholders practiced \"term slavery,\" registering deeds of manumission but postponing the actual date of freedom for a decade or more. Baltimore's shrinking population of enslaved people often lived and worked alongside the city's growing free black population as \"quasi-freedmen.\" With unskilled and semiskilled employment readily available in the shipyards and related industries, little friction with white workers occurred. Despite the overall poverty of the city's free blacks, compared with the condition of those living in Philadelphia, Charleston, and [[New Orleans]], Baltimore was a \"city of refuge,\" where enslaved and free blacks alike found an unusual amount of freedom. Churches, schools, and fraternal and benevolent associations provided a cushion against hardening white attitudes toward free people of color in the wake of [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|Nat Turner's revolt]] in Virginia in 1831. But a flood of [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|German]] and [[Irish American|Irish]] immigrants swamped Baltimore's labor market after 1840, driving free blacks deeper into poverty.<ref>Christopher Phillips ''Freedom's Port: The African American Community of Baltimore, 1791-1860'' (1997)</ref>\n\nThe Maryland Chemical Works of Baltimore used a mix of free labor, hired slave labor, and enslaved people held by the corporation to work in its factory.<ref>{{cite book|title=Maryland History In Prints 1743-1900|first=Laura|last=Rice|page=77}}</ref> Since chemicals needed constant attention, the rapid turnover of free white labor encouraged the owner to use enslaved workers. While slave labor was about 20 percent cheaper, the company began to reduce its dependence on enslaved labor in 1829 when two slaves ran away and one died.<ref>T. Stephen Whitman, \"Industrial Slavery at the Margin: the Maryland Chemical Works,\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 1993 59(1): 31-62,</ref>\n\nThe location of Baltimore in a border state created opportunities for enslaved people in the city to run away and find freedom in the north\u2014as [[Frederick Douglass]] did. Therefore, slaveholders in Baltimore frequently turned to gradual manumission as a means to secure dependable and productive labor from slaves. In promising freedom after a fixed period of years, slaveholders intended to reduce the costs associated with lifetime servitude while providing slaves incentive for cooperation. Enslaved people tried to negotiate terms of manumission that were more advantageous, and the implicit threat of flight weighed significantly in slaveholders' calculations. The dramatic decrease in the enslaved population during 1850-60 indicates that slavery was no longer profitable in the city. Slaves were still used as expensive house servants: it was cheaper to hire a free worker by the day, with the option of dropping him or replacing him with a better worker, rather than run the expense of maintaining a slave month in and month out with little flexibility.<ref>Stephen Whitman,  \"Manumission and the Transformation of Urban Slavery,\" ''Social Science History'' 1995 19(3): 333-370</ref>\n\nOn the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Baltimore had the largest free black community in the nation. About 15 schools for black people were operating, including Sabbath schools operated by Methodists, Presbyterians, and Quakers, along with several private academies. All black schools were self-sustaining, receiving no state or local government funds, and whites in Baltimore generally opposed educating the black population, continuing to tax black property holders to maintain schools from which black children were excluded by law. Baltimore's black community, nevertheless, was one of the largest and most divided in America due to this experience.<ref name=\"Collier-Thomas\">{{cite book |last=Collier-Thomas |first=Bettye |authorlink= |title=The Baltimore Black Community, 1865-1910 |url= |accessdate= |year=1974 |publisher=George Washington University |location=Washington, DC |isbn= |page= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Know-Nothing Party and Baltimore politics===\nBaltimore in the [[Third Party System]] had two-party competitive elections, with powerful bosses, carefully orchestrated political violence, and an emerging working-class consciousness at the polls. The fierce politics of the 1850s had galvanized the white workers, most of them German, who opposed slavery. The American Party emerged in the mid-1850s to represent Protestants and to counter the Democratic Party, which was increasingly controlled by [[Catholic Irish]]. When Baltimore erupted in violence at the time of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s 1861 inauguration, for example, the pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] \"Blood Tubs\" that took to the streets were veterans of political rioting. The nativist American ([[Know-Nothing]]) Party captured the Baltimore government in 1854. The party promoted modernization, including professionalizing police and fire departments, expanding the courts, and upgrading the water supply.<ref>Frank Towers, \"Mobtown\" (2012) p 470</ref> The party used [[Spoils system|patronage]] and, especially, coercion and election-day violence; its armed gangs scared off Democratic voters, but the Irish and Germans fought back. Voters elected a congressman and governor nominated by the party during its short life. In 1860 the Democrat-controlled legislature took back the city police, the [[state militia|militia]], patronage, and the electoral machinery, and prosecuted some Know-Nothings for electoral fraud. By 1861 the Know-Nothings had split over secession.<ref name=\"Towers\">{{cite book |last=Towers |first=Frank |authorlink= |title=The Urban South and the Coming of the Civil War |url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville, VA |isbn=0-8139-2297-6 |page= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Baltimore during and after the Civil War: 1861\u20141894 ==\n\n===Civil War===\n[[File:Baltimore Riot 1861.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Baltimore riot of 1861]]]]\nThe Civil War divided Baltimore and Maryland's residents. Much of the social and political elite favored the Confederacy\u2014and indeed owned house slaves. In the 1860 election the city's large German element voted not for Lincoln but for Southern Democrat [[John C. Breckinridge]]. They were less concerned with the abolition of slavery, an issue emphasized by Republicans, and much more with nativism, temperance, and religious beliefs, associated with the Know-Nothing Party and strongly opposed by the Democrats. However the Germans hated slavery and supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref name=\"Towers\" />\n\nWhen [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers from the [[6th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia|6th Massachusetts Militia]] and some unarmed [[Pennsylvania National Guard|Pennsylvania state militia]] known as the \"Washington Brigade\" from [[Philadelphia]] with their band marched through the city at the start of the war, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers attacked the troops, which led to the first bloodshed in the Civil War during the [[Baltimore riot of 1861]]. Four soldiers and twelve civilians were killed during the riot, which caused Union troops to later occupy Baltimore in May under Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] of Massachusetts. Maryland came under direct federal administration\u2014in part, to prevent the state from seceding\u2014until the end of the war in April 1865.\n\nWhen Massachusetts troops marched through the city on April 19, 1861, en route to [[Washington, D.C.]], a [[Baltimore riot of 1861|rebel mob attacked]]; 4 soldiers and 12 rioters were dead, and 36 soldiers and uncounted rioters had been injured. Governor [[Thomas Holliday Hicks|Thomas Hicks]] realized action needed to be taken. He convened a special session of the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly]] but moved its location to a site in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], a distance from the secessionist groups. In doing this and by other actions, Hicks managed to neutralize the General Assembly to avoid Maryland's secession from the Union, becoming a hero in the eyes of the Unionists in the state. Meanwhile, pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] gangs burned the bridges connecting Baltimore and Washington to the North, and cut the telegraph lines. Lincoln sent in federal troops under Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Ben Butler]]; they seized the city, imposed [[martial law]], and arrested leading Confederate spokesmen. The prisoners were later released and the rail lines reopened, making Baltimore a major Union base during the war.<ref>Browne, ''Baltimore in the Nation, 1789-1861'' (1980); Sheads and Toomey, ''Baltimore during the Civil War'' (1997).</ref>\n\n===African Americans after the Civil War===\nMaryland was not subject to [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], but the end of slavery meant heightened racial tensions as free blacks flocked to the city and many armed confrontations erupted between blacks and whites. Rural blacks who flocked to Baltimore created increased competition for skilled jobs and upset the prewar relationship between free blacks and whites. As black migrants were relegated to unskilled work or no work at all, violent strikes erupted. Denied entry into the regular state militia, armed blacks formed militias of their own. In the midst of this change, white Baltimoreans interpreted black discontent as disrespect for law and order, which justified police repression.<ref>Richard Paul Fuke,  \"Blacks, Whites, and Guns: Interracial Violence in Post-emancipation Maryland,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1997 92(3): 326-347</ref>\n[[File:Sharp Street Memorial United Methodist Church and Community House.jpg|alt=Photograph of Sharp Street Church on Dolphin Street|thumb|Sharp Street Church was established 1787 and erected existing building in 1898]]\nBaltimore had a larger population of African Americans than any northern city. The new Maryland state constitution of 1864 ended slavery and provided for the education of all children, including blacks. The Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of the Colored People established schools for blacks that were taken over by the public school system, which then restricted education for blacks beginning in 1867 when Democrats regained control of the city. Establishing an unequal system that prepared white students for citizenship while using education to reinforce black subjugation, Baltimore's postwar school system exposed the contradictions of race, education, and republicanism in an age when African Americans struggled to realize the ostensible freedoms gained by emancipation.<ref>Robert S. Wolff, \"The Problem of Race in the Age of Freedom: Emancipation and the Transformation of Republican Schooling in Baltimore, 1860-1867,\" ''Civil War History'' 2006 52(3): 229-254</ref> Thus blacks found themselves forced to support [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] legislation and urged that the \"colored schools\" be staffed only with black teachers. From 1867 to 1900 black schools grew from 10 to 27 and enrollment from 901 to 9,383. The Mechanical and Industrial Association achieved success only in 1892 with the opening of the Colored Manual Training School. Black leaders were convinced by the Rev. William Alexander and his newspaper, the ''[[Baltimore Afro-American|Afro American]]'', that economic advancement and first-class citizenship depended on equal access to schools.<ref name=\"Collier-Thomas\" />\n\n===Economic growth===\n[[File:Baltimore Street Map, 1892.jpg|thumb|Baltimore Street Map, 1892]]\nBy 1880 manufacturing replaced trade and made the city a nationally important industrial center. The port continued to ship increasing amounts of grain, flour, tobacco, and raw cotton to Europe. The new industries of men's clothing, canning, tin and sheet-iron ware products, foundry and machine shop products, cars, and tobacco manufacture had the largest labor force and largest product value.<ref>Eleanor S. Bruchey,  \"The Development of Baltimore Business, 1880-1914,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1969 64(1): 18-42</ref>\n\nThe construction of new housing was a major factor in Baltimore's economy. Vill (1986) examines the activities of major builders between 1869 and 1896, especially as they gained access to building land and capital. Most, but not all, of the major builders were craftsmen who were entrepreneurs compared with others in the building trades, but were still small businessmen who built small numbers of houses during long careers. They worked with landowners, and both groups manipulated the city's leasehold system to their own advantage. Builders obtained credit from a diverse array of sources, including sellers of land, building societies, and land companies. The most important source was individual lenders, who lent money in small amounts either on their own account or through lawyers and trustees overseeing funds held in trust. In spite of their important role in shaping the city, the contractors were small businessmen who rarely achieved citywide visibility.<ref>Martha J. Vill, \"Building Enterprise in Late Nineteenth-Century Baltimore,\" ''Journal of Historical Geograph'' 1986 12(2): 162-181,</ref> Until the 1890s, Baltimore remained a patchwork of nationalities with white natives, [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|German]] and [[History of the Irish in Baltimore|Irish immigrants]], and [[African Americans in Maryland|black Baltimoreans]] scattered throughout the 'social quilt' in heterogeneous neighborhoods.\n\n[[File:Sixth Maryland Regiment firing on the rioters in Baltimore.png|thumb|240px|[[Baltimore railroad strike of 1877]]]]\nBaltimore was the origin of a major [[Baltimore railroad strike of 1877|railroad workers' strike in 1877]] when the B&O company attempted to lower wages. On July 20, 1877, Maryland Governor [[John Lee Carroll]] called up the 5th and 6th Regiments of the [[Maryland Army National Guard|National Guard]] to end the strikes, which had disrupted train service at [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]] in western Maryland. Citizens sympathetic to the railroad workers attacked the National Guard troops as they marched from their armories in Baltimore to [[Camden Station]]. Soldiers from the 6th Regiment fired on the crowd, killing 10 and wounding 25. Rioters then damaged B&O trains and burned portions of the rail station. Order was restored in the city on July 21\u201322 when federal troops arrived to protect railroad property and end the strike.\n\n===YWCA===\nExpanded economic activity brought many immigrants from the countryside and from Europe after the Civil War. Concerns for young, single Protestant women alone in cities led to the growth of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA) movement. When the Baltimore YWCA was founded in 1883, they only offered their services to white women and so the Colored Women's YWCA was founded in 1896. They merged in 1920.<ref>{{cite|title=YWCA Greater Baltimore: Our History|url=http://www.ywcagreaterbaltimore.org/index.php/about/history|publisher=YWCA Greater Baltimore|accessdate=12 Apr 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Progressive Era: 1895\u20141928==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Population growth and decline\n|-\n!

The Rebuilding of Baltimore |pages=249ff}}</ref> Baltimore was a poorly managed city in 1890, despite its economic vitality. Already [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], and New York were moving to modernize their [[public works]] infrastructures and to support the construction of [[capital-intensive]], technologically sophisticated [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]] and [[water supply]] systems. Baltimore lagged behind the other American metropolises because of its culture of privatism and the politicization of its municipal administration. However, during the 1890-1920 period the city responded to the same concerns as Chicago, New York, and Boston. The increase in urban crises, particularly the 1904 fire and the deterioration of sanitary conditions, prompted demands for reform. Moreover, the municipal administration underwent a process of moralization and professionalization in the 20th century. Afterward, Baltimore modeled itself on the other American metropolises and chose to modernize its institutions and address the industrial and urban challenges of the era.<ref>{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Alan D. |authorlink= |title=The Origin and Resolution of an Urban Crisis: Baltimore, 1890-1930 |series=Johns Hopkins studies in urban affairs |url=https://archive.org/details/originresolution0000ande |accessdate= |year=1977 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=9780801819704 |page= |pages= |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n===Park planning===\nThe story of the Patapsco Forest Reserve (later renamed the [[Patapsco Valley State Park]]) near Baltimore reveals notable connections between the Progressive-era movements for forest conservation and urban park planning. In 1903, the Patapsco Valley site, although outside the city boundary, was nevertheless identified by the Olmstead Brothers landscape architecture firm as an ideal site to acquire property for future park development. At the same time, the Maryland State Board of Forestry, seeking to establish scientific forestry research, received donated land for this purpose in the Patapsco Valley. Over subsequent decades, a powerful alliance of urban elites, state managers, and city officials assembled thousands of acres along the Patapsco River. The site evolved into a unique hybrid of forest preserve and public park that reflected both its location on the urban fringe and its dual heritage in the conservation and parks movements.<ref>Geoffrey L. Buckley, et al. \"The Patapsco Forest Reserve: Establishing a 'City Park' for Baltimore, 1907-1941,\" ''Historical Geography'' 2006 34: 87-108</ref>\n\n===Baseball===\nWhen in 1918 the US government reversed its draft exemption for married workers and required all men to work in essential occupations or serve in the military, professional baseball players either enlisted or joined industrial baseball leagues. Company leagues included those of [[Bethlehem Steel]], which had recreational leagues on both coasts that by 1918 represented a major-league level of competition. [[Sparrows Point, Maryland]], a Bethlehem Steel company town, had a Steel League team, whose results Baltimore baseball fans followed closely. At the same time, fans also followed the draft status and 1918 season of Baltimore native [[Babe Ruth]], then playing with the Boston Red Sox and considering his own options, including joining an industrial league team. In September Bethlehem Steel, fearing competition with other leagues over professional talent, disbanded the Steel League. When the war ended in November, players such as Ruth were free to re-sign with their major league teams.<ref>Peter T. Dalleo, and J. Vincent Watchorn, III, \"Baltimore, the 'Babe,' and the Bethlehem Steel League, 1918,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1998 93(1): 88-106,</ref>\n\n==Depression and War: 1929\u20141949==\nArgersinger (1988) describes the loss of power by traditional Democratic leaders and organizations in Baltimore under the [[New Deal]]. The old-line Democrats operated in the spirit of traditional political bosses who dispensed the patronage. They were, at best, lukewarm Roosevelt supporters because the New Deal threatened their monopoly on patronage. Blacks, other ethnic groups, labor, and other former supporters turned from their patrons to other leadership. Baltimore Mayor Howard W. Jackson's support gradually eroded until he was defeated in a gubernatorial primary election to choose an opponent for a Republican who earlier defeated Governor Albert C. Richie, a conservative Democrat.<ref>Jo Ann E.  Argersinger, ''Toward a New Deal in Baltimore: People and Government in the Great Depression'' (1988)</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Construction of aircraft at the Glenn L. Martin plant at Baltimore, MD. Machine gun turrets are completely assembled... - NARA - 520744.jpg|thumb|Worker assembling an aircraft at the Glenn L. Martin plant in Baltimore]]\nBaltimore was a major war production center in [[World War II]]. The biggest operations were Bethlehem Steel's Fairfield Yard, on the southeastern edge of the harbor, which built Liberty ships; its work force peaked at 46,700 in late 1943. Even larger was [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Glenn Martin]], an aircraft plant located {{convert|10|mi|km}} northeast of downtown. By late 1943 about 150,000 to 200,000 migrant war workers had arrived. They were predominantly poor white southerners; most came from the hills of Virginia, [[North Carolina]], [[West Virginia]], Pennsylvania, [[Kentucky]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Tennessee]]. War mobilization brought federal pressure to unionize the work force, and by 1941 the leftist [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] had organized most of Baltimore's large industries, while the more conservative [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] also gained many new members. By 1945, labor unions and ethnics had taken over local politics and liberal mayors enjoyed black as well as white support. The machine was led by Italian Catholic politicians such as [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s father, [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.]], who was mayor in 1947-59; her brother, [[Thomas D'Alesandro III]], was mayor from 1967 to 1971.<ref>Pelosi married and moved to San Francisco in the late 1960s.</ref>\n\n[[John Francis Cronin|Father John F. Cronin]]'s early confrontations with Communists in the World War II-era labor movement turned him into a leading anti-Communist in the Catholic Church and the US government during the [[Cold War]]. Father Cronin, then a prominent Catholic parish priest, saw a united labor movement as central to his moderate, reformist vision for Baltimore's social ills, and worked closely with anti-Communist labor leaders.<ref>Joshua B. Freeman, and Steve Rosswurm, \"The Education of an Anti-Communist: Father John F. Cronin and the Baltimore Labor Movement,\" ''Labor History'' 1992 33(2): 217-247</ref>\n\n==Cold War era==\nIn 1950, the city's population topped out at 950,000 people, of whom 24 percent were black. Then the [[white flight|white movement to the suburbs]] began in earnest, and the population inside the city limits steadily declined and became proportionately more black.\n\n===Schools===\nIntegration of [[Baltimore City Public Schools|Baltimore's public schools]] at first went smoothly, as city elites suppressed working class white complaints, as white families migrated to suburban school systems. By the 1970s new problems had surfaced. Formerly white schools had become mostly black schools, though whites still made up most of the faculty and administration. Worse, the school system had become dependent on federal funding. In 1974, these circumstances led to two dramatic incidents. A teachers' strike highlighted the city's unwillingness to raise teachers' salaries because a hike in property taxes would further alienate white residents. A second crisis revolved around a federally mandated desegregation plan that also threatened to alienate the remaining white residents. \n\n===Drugs===\n[[Heroin]] supply and use in Baltimore rose explosively in the 1960s, following a trend of rising drug use across the United States. In the late 1940s there were only a few dozen African-American heroin addicts in the Pennsylvania Avenue area of the city. Heroin use began largely for reasons of prestige within a group that most middle-class blacks looked down on. When the Baltimore police formed the three-man narcotics squad in 1951 there was only moderate profit in drug dealing and shoplifting was the addict's crime of choice. By the late 1950s young whites were using the drug, and by 1960 there were over one thousand heroin addicts in the police files; this figure doubled in the 1960s. A generation of profiteering young, violent black dealers took over in the 1960s as violence increased and the price of heroin skyrocketed. Increasing drug usage was the primary reason for burglaries rising tenfold and robberies rising thirtyfold from 1950 to 1970. Soaring numbers of broken homes and Baltimore's declining economic status probably exacerbated the drug problem. Adolescents in suburban areas began using drugs in the late 1960s.<ref>Jill Jonnes, \"Everybody Must Get Stoned: The Origins Of Modern Drug Culture In Baltimore,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1996 91(2): 132-155</ref>\n\n===Civil rights===\nIn the 1930s and 1940s the local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], the black churches, and the ''Afro-American'' weekly newspaper took charge of organizing and publicizing demonstrations. There was no rioting.\n\n[[Read's Drug Store]] in Baltimore was the site of one of the nation's earliest [[sit-in]]s in January 1955.

The churches were instrumental in keeping lines of communication open between the geographically and politically divided middle-class and poor blacks, a chasm that had widened since the end of World War II. Ministers formed a network across churches and denominations and did much of the face-to-face work of motivating people to organize and protest. In many cases they also adopted King's theology of justice and freedom and altered their preaching styles.<ref>David Milobsky, \"Power from the Pulpit: Baltimore's African-American Clergy, 1950-1970,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine' '1994 89(3): 274-289,</ref>\n\n===1968 unrest===\n{{main|Baltimore riot of 1968|King assassination riots}}\nUnrest in the black inner-city exploded for four nights in April 1968, after news arrived of the assassination of the Reverend [[Martin Luther King]] in Memphis Tennessee.<ref>Peter B.

About a thousand businesses were ransacked or burned, especially liquor stores, supermarkets, furniture stores, and taverns. Many shops never reopened, leaving the burned-out districts permanently under-served by retail stores. Governor [[Spiro T. Agnew]] sent in 5,000 National Guardsmen and imposed an 11 p.m. curfew. That was not enough, so President Lyndon Johnson, at the governor's request, sent in 6,000 U.S. Army combat troops to finally regain control of the city. The episode was a stimulus for an exodus to the suburbs and a political backlash by white voters.<ref>Timothy Wheeler, \"City rioting evokes memories of 1968 unrest'' [http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-riots/bs-md-riots-1968-20150428-story.html ''The Baltimore Sun'' 28 April, 2015]</ref> Agnew's statement that \"evil men and not evil conditions\" caused the riots resonated with white ethnic urban voters, and Republican [[Richard Nixon]] selected Agnew as his vice presidential running mate that summer.<ref>Elizabeth Nix and Jessica Elfenbein, eds., ''Baltimore '68: Riots and Rebirth in an American City'' (2011), p. xiii [https://www.amazon.com/Baltimore-68-Riots-Rebirth-American-ebook/dp/B006JY2I2E/ excerpt]</ref>\n\n===Backlash===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, racial politics intensified in Baltimore, as in other cities. White Southerners came to Baltimore for factory jobs during World War II, permanently altering the city's political landscape. The new arrivals approved of the segregated system that had been in effect since the early 20th century. Working whites mobilized to prevent school integration after the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision of the Supreme Court in 1954. They believed that their interests were being sacrificed to those of black Americans. As working-class whites began to feel increasingly embattled in the face of federal intervention into local practices, many turned to the 1964 presidential primary campaign of [[George Wallace]] who swept the white working class vote. Durr (2003) explains the defection of white working-class voters in Baltimore to the Republican Party as being caused by their fears that the Democratic Party's desegregation policies posed a threat to their families, workplaces, and neighborhoods.<ref>Kenneth Durr, \"When Southern Politics Came North: the Roots of White Working-class Conservatism in Baltimore, 1940-1964,\" ''Labor History'' (1996) 37#3 pp: 309-331; Durr, ''Behind the Backlash: White Working-Class Politics in Baltimore, 1940-1980'' (2003)</ref>\n\nBetween 1950 and 1990, Baltimore's population declined by more than 200,000.

Important bishops include [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] (1735\u20131815, in office 1789-1815), [[Francis Kenrick]] (1796\u20131863, in office 1851-65), and especially Cardinal [[James Gibbons]] (1834\u20141921, in office 1877-1921).\n\nIn 1806-21 Catholics constructed the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, based on a neoclassical design by architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]]. The church completed a $34-million restoration based on Latrobe's original plans in 2006.\n\nDuring 1948-61, the Archdiocese of Baltimore was under the leadership of [[Francis Patrick Keough]]. The Baltimore Church identified with the anti-Communist and anti-pornography movements and with the expansion of Catholic institutions that addressed a myriad of social, economic, and educational issues. The Church also coordinated a multitude of action projects under the financial control of the Baltimore chancery.<ref>Spalding (1989)</ref>\n\n===Methodists===\nThe Methodists were well received in Maryland in the 1760-1840 era, and Baltimore became an important center.<ref>Dee E. Andrews, ''The Methodists and Revolutionary America, 1760-1800: The Shaping of an Evangelical Culture'' (2000)</ref> Sutton (1998) looks at Methodist artisans and craftsmen, showing they embraced an evangelical identity, Protestant ethic, and complex organizational structure. This enabled them to express their anti-elitist or populist \"producerist\" values of self-discipline, honesty, frugality, and industry; they denounced greed, and sought an interdependent common good. Such producerist views drew on aspects of the Wesleyan ethic, appropriated the commonweal traditions of 18th-century [[republicanism]], and initially resisted those of classical liberal, individualistic, self-interested capitalism. They also accorded well with and helped produce the emerging amalgam of American populist, restorationist, biblicistic, revivalistic activism that Sutton terms \"Arminianized Calvinism.\"<ref name=\"Sutton\">{{cite book |last=Sutton |first=William R. |authorlink= |title=Journeymen for Jesus: Evangelical Artisans Confront Capitalism in Jacksonian Baltimore |url= |accessdate= |year=1998 |publisher=Penn State Press |location= |isbn=9780271044125 |page= |pages=}}</ref>\n\nInside the Methodist Church the artisans were reformers who focused on three substantive and symbolic targets, each of which would democratize Methodist conferences: lay suffrage and representation; inclusion of the local preachers, who constituted two-thirds of Methodist leadership; and election of the officers who carried the administrative, personnel, and supervisory power, the presiding elders. The appeals made on behalf of these democratizations, Sutton shows, drew imaginatively on both producerist and Wesleyan rhetoric. By the 1850s, Sutton (1998) shows that the corporate ideals and individual disciplines of religious producerism were expressed in trade unionism, in evangelical missions to workers, in factory preaching, in workers' congregations, in temperance and Sabbatarianism, in the Sunday school movement, and in the politics of Protestant communal hegemony.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />\n\n===Baptists===\nThe Appalachians and southern whites arriving in the 1940s brought along a strong religious tradition with them. Southern Baptist churches multiplied during the mid and late 1940s.<ref>Rosalind Robinson Levering, ''Baltimore Baptists, 1773-1973: A History of the Baptist Work in Baltimore During 200 Years'' (1973) pp 97-168.</ref>\n\n===Evangelical Lutherans===\nThe Zion Evangelical Lutheran congregation was founded in 1755 in order to serve the needs of Lutheran [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|immigrants from Germany]], as well as [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Germans from Pennsylvania]] who moved to Baltimore. It has a\nbi-lingual congregation that provides sermons in both [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]]. In 1762 the congregation built its first church on Fish Street (now East Saratoga Street). It was replaced by a bigger building, the current Zion Church on North Gay Street and East Lexington Street erected from 1807 to 1808. An addition to the west along Lexington Street to Holliday Street of an \"Aldersaal\" (parish house), bell tower, parsonage, and enclosed garden in North German Hanseatic architecture under Pastor Julius K. Hoffman was made in 1912-1913.\n\n=== Jews ===\n{{Main|History of the Jews in Baltimore}}\n\nAlthough the extent of Baltimore Jewry in the 18th century is not known, the existence of a Jewish cemetery in Baltimore can be traced back to 1786. The Jewish community grew significantly in the 19th century forming synagogues including ''Nidche Yisroel'' (now the [[Baltimore Hebrew Congregation]]; 1830), [[Har Sinai Congregation]] (1842), the Fell's Point Congregation (1848), and [[Temple Oheb Shalom (Baltimore, Maryland)|Temple Oheb Shalom]] (1853).<ref>[[Cyrus Adler]] & [[Henrietta Szold]], \"[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2420-baltimore Baltimore]\", in ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', ed.

It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries.<ref name=\"hogg2002\">Hogg, Ian (2002). ''Jane's Guns Recognition Guide''.

The [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] variant of the FAL was redesigned from FN's [[metre|metrical]] FAL into British [[imperial units]] and was produced under licence as the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1946, the first FAL prototype was completed. It was designed to fire the intermediate [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]] cartridge developed and used by the forces of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] during [[World War II]] (with the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]]). After testing this prototype in 1948, the [[British Army]] urged FN to build additional prototypes, including one in [[bullpup]] configuration, chambered for their new [[.280 British]] [7x43mm] caliber intermediate cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\">{{cite web|url=http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|title=FN FAL (Belgium)|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117172148/http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|archive-date=17 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> After evaluating the single bullpup prototype, FN decided to return instead to their original, conventional design for future production.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/>\n\nIn 1950, the United Kingdom presented the redesigned FN rifle and the British [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]], both in .280 British calibre, to the United States for comparison testing against the favoured [[United States Army]] design of the time\u2014Earle Harvey's T25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html|title=Earl Harvey's T-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325165934/http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html |archivedate= 25 March 2012|work=powmadeak47.com}}</ref> It was hoped that a common cartridge and rifle could be standardized for issue to the armies of all NATO member countries. After this testing was completed, U.S. Army officials suggested that FN should redesign their rifle to fire the U.S. prototype \".30 Light Rifle\" cartridge. FN decided to hedge their bets with the U.S., and in 1951 even made a deal that the U.S. could produce FALs royalty-free, given that the UK appeared to be favouring their own EM-2.\n\nThis decision appeared to be correct when the British Army decided to adopt the EM-2 (as Rifle No.9 Mk1) and .280 British cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/> This decision was later rescinded after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] lost the 1951 General Election and [[Winston Churchill]] returned as Prime Minister. It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that there was a [[quid pro quo]] agreement between Churchill and U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] in 1952 that the British accept the .30 Light Rifle cartridge as NATO standard in return for the U.S. acceptance of the FN FAL as NATO standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|title=The FN FAL Was Almost America's Battle Rifle|first=War Is|last=Boring|date=5 October 2014|access-date=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506202808/https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|archive-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The .30 Light Rifle cartridge was in fact later standardized as the 7.62&nbsp;mm NATO; however, the U.S. insisted on continued rifle tests. The FAL chambered for the .30 Light Rifle went up against the redesigned T25 (now redesignated as the T47), and an M1 Garand variant, the T44. Eventually, the T44 won, becoming the [[M14 rifle|M14]]. However, in the meantime, most other NATO countries were evaluating and selecting the FAL.\n\nFN created what is possibly the classic post-war [[battle rifle]]. Formally introduced by its designer [[Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive]] in 1951, and produced two years later, it has been described as the \"Right Arm of the Free World.\"{{sfn|Cashner|2013|p=5}} The FAL battle rifle has its [[Warsaw Pact]] counterpart in the [[AKM]], each being fielded by dozens of countries and produced in many of them. A few, such as Israel and South Africa, manufactured and issued both designs at various times. Unlike the Soviet AKM assault rifle, the FAL utilized a heavier full-power [[rifle]] [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]].\n\n==Design details==\n[[File:PISTONM16.gif|thumb|left|Short-stroke gas piston, the action used on the FAL.]]\n[[File:L1A1 FIELD STRIPPED.jpg|thumb|left|L1A1 British FAL variant field stripped.]]\n\nThe FAL operates by means of a [[gas-operated]] [[Firearm action|action]] very similar to that of the Russian [[SVT-40]]. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston housed above the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], and the locking mechanism is what is known as a ''tilting breechblock''. To lock, it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] much like the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolts]] of the Russian [[SKS]] [[carbine]] and French [[MAS-49]] series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the gas plug, to allow for the firing of [[rifle grenade]]s and manual operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|title=Tuning the FAL's Gas System|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112160722/http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|archive-date=12 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed [[Stock (firearms)|stock]] versions of the FAL, the [[recoil]] spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the receiver cover, necessitating a slightly different receiver cover, recoil spring, and bolt carrier, and a modified lower receiver for the stock.<ref name=\"popeneker\">Popeneker, Maxim & Williams, Anthony (2005). ''Assault Rifle''. The Crowood Press Ltd. {{ISBN|1-86126-700-2}}.</ref>\nFor field stripping the FAL can be opened. During opening the rifle pivots between the trigger guard and magazine well to give access to the action and piston system. This opening method causes a suboptimal iron sight line as the rear and front sight elements of the sight line are fixed to two different movable subassemblies. The sight radius for the FAL 50.00 and FAL 50.41 models is {{cvt|553|mm|1}} and for the 50.61 and FAL 50.63 models {{cvt|549|mm|in|1}}.\n \nFAL rifles have also been manufactured in both light and heavy-barrel configurations, with the heavy barrel intended for automatic fire as a section or squad light support weapon. Most heavy barrel FALs are equipped with [[bipod]]s, although some light barrel models were equipped with bipods, such as the Austrian StG58 and the German G1, and a bipod was later made available as an accessory.\n\nAmong other 7.62\u00d751mm NATO battle rifles at the time, the FN FAL had relatively light recoil, due to the user-adjustable gas system being able to be tuned via a regulator in fore-end of the rifle, which allowed for excess gas which would simply increase recoil to bleed off. The regulator is an adjustable gas port opening that adjusts the rifle to function reliably with various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior, making the FAL not ammunition specific. In fully automatic mode, however, the shooter receives considerable abuse from recoil, and the weapon climbs off-target quickly, making automatic fire only of marginal effectiveness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small arms visual encyclopedia|last=J.|first=Dougherty, Martin|publisher=Amber Books|year=2011|isbn=9781907446986|location=London|pages=222|oclc=751804871}}</ref> Many military forces using the FAL eventually eliminated full-automatic firearms training in the light-barrel FAL.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from FN FAL -->\n\n===FN production variants===\n\nDepending on the variant and the country of adoption, the FAL was issued as either [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] only or [[selective fire|select-fire]] (capable of both semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes).\n\n====LAR 50.41 & 50.42 (FAL HBAR & FALO)====\n* Also known as FALO as an abbreviation from the French ''Fusil Automatique Lourd'';\n* Heavy barrel for sustained fire with a 30-round magazine as a [[squad automatic weapon]];\n* Known in Canada as the C2A1, it was their primary squad automatic weapon until it was phased out during the 1980s in favor of the [[FN Minimi|C9]], which has better accuracy and higher ammunition capacity than the C2;\n* Known to the Australian Army as the L2A1, it was replaced by the FN Minimi.

Although the [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]] \"bullpup\" did well, American observers protested that the small-bore .280-caliber round lacked the power and range of a medium-bore .30-caliber round. British observers in return claimed the experimental American [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|.30-caliber T65 round]] [7.62\u00d751mm] was too powerful to control in automatic fire. Britain was forced to abandon the promising .280 round and adopt the American-designed .30-caliber T65 as the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The EM-2 couldn't be rechambered for the longer and more powerful cartridge and the Americans didn't yet have a working service rifle of their own. Britain and Canada adopted the Belgian 7.62mm FN FAL instead as the L1 ''Self-Loading Rifle'' (SLR).\n* '''FAL .280 Experimental Automatic Carbine, Short Model (1951)''': A [[Bullpup|bullpup-frame]] version of the FAL chambered in .280 British designed to compete with the British EM-1 and EM-2 bullpup rifles.

It is essentially a user-customized version of the FAL and is still in use, mainly as a drill weapon in the Austrian forces. It was selected in a 1958 competition, beating the Spanish [[CETME]] and American [[Armalite AR-10|AR-10]].\n\n[[File:West German FN FAL.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Two West German soldiers on a joint exercise in 1960. West Germany used the FN FAL designated as G1.]]\n\nMost StG 58s featured a folding bipod, and differ from the FAL by using a plastic [[stock (firearms)|stock]] rather than wood in order to reduce weight in the later production rifles (although some of the early FN-built production rifles did come with wooden stocks). The rifle can be distinguished from its Belgian and Argentine counterparts by its combination [[flash suppressor]] and [[grenade launcher]]. The foregrip was a two-part steel pressing.\n\nSteyr-built StG 58s had a hammer forged barrel that was considered to be the best barrel fitted to any FAL. Some StG58s had modifications made to the fire mode selector so that the fully automatic option was removed, leaving the selector with only safe and single-shot positions. The StG 58 was replaced by the [[Steyr AUG]] in 1977, although the StG 58 served with many units as the primary service rifle through the mid-1980s.\n\n====Olin/Winchester FAL====\nA semi-automatic, twin-barrel variant chambered in the 5.56mm Duplex round during [[Project SALVO]].

It comes with a 406&nbsp;mm (16&nbsp;in), 457&nbsp;mm (18&nbsp;in) or 533&nbsp;mm (21&nbsp;in) barrel, an [[Hiduminium|aluminum-alloy]] lower receiver, and improved [[Glass-filled polymer|Glass-filled]] [[Nylon]] furniture. Civilian models are semi-automatic, but military and Law Enforcement clients can procure select-fire models that have a fully automatic [[cyclic rate]] of 750 rounds/minute. The DSA-58 can use any metric-measurement FAL magazines, which come in 5, 10, 20 or 30-round capacities.\n* The '''DSA-58 OSW (''Operational Specialist Weapon'')''' is an assault carbine version of the paratrooper model of the FAL. It has a side-folding Enhanced PARA polymer stock, shorter 279&nbsp;mm (11 inch) or 330&nbsp;mm (13 inch) barrel and an optional full-auto setting.\n* The '''DSA-58 CTC (''Compact Tactical Carbine'')''' is a carbine version of the FAL.

The FAL was also exported to many other countries, such as [[Venezuela]], where a small-arms industry produces some basically unchanged variants, as well as ammunition. By modern standards, one disadvantage of the FAL is the amount of work which goes into machining the complex receiver, bolt and bolt carrier. Some theorized that the movement of the tilting bolt mechanism tends to return differently with each shot, affecting inherent accuracy of the weapon, but this has been proven to be false. The FAL's receiver is machined, while most other modern military rifles use quicker stamping or casting techniques. Modern FALs have many improvements over those produced by FN and others in the mid-20th-century.\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 19.JPG|thumb|Weapons in the [[Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n]], [[Buenos Aires]]]]\n\nThe Argentine Armed Forces officially adopted the FN FAL in 1955, but the first FN made examples did not arrive in Argentina until the autumn of 1958. Subsequently, in 1960, licensed production of FALs began and continued until the mid-to-late 1990s, when production ceased. In 2010, a project to modernize all existing FAL and to produce an unknown number of them was approved. This project was called FAL M5.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nArgentine FALs were produced by the government-owned arsenal FM (Fabricaciones Militares) at the F\u00e1brica Militar de Armas Port\u00e1tiles \"Domingo Matheu\" (FMAP \"DM\") in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]. The acronym \"FAL\" was kept, its translation being \"Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Liviano\", (Light Automatic Rifle). Production weapons included \"Standard\" and \"Para\" (folding buttstock) versions. Military rifles were produced with the full auto fire option. The rifles were usually known as the FM FAL, for the \"Fabricaciones Militares\" brand name (FN and FM have a long-standing licensing and manufacturing agreement). A heavy barrel version, known as the ''FAP'' (''Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado'', or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon. The Argentine 'heavy barrel' FAL, also used by several other nations, was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode.\n\n[[Image:Bayoneta de FAL.JPG|thumb|left|150px|FAL [[bayonet]].]]\n\nA version of the FALMP III chambered in the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] cartridge was developed in the early 1980s. It used M16 type magazines but one version called the FALMP III 5.56mm Type 2 used [[Steyr AUG]] magazines. The [[FARA 83]] (Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Rep\u00fablica Argentina) was to replace the Argentine military's FAL rifles. The design borrowed features from the FAL such as the gas system and folding stock. It seems to have been also influenced to some degree by other rifles (the Beretta AR70/223, M16, and the [[IMI Galil|Galil]]). An estimated quantity of between 2,500 and 3,000 examples were produced for field testing, but military spending cuts killed the project in the mid-1980s.\n\nThere was also a semi-automatic\u2013only version, the ''FSL'', intended for the civilian market. Legislation changes in 1995 (namely, the enactment of ''Presidential Decree N\u00ba 64/95'') imposed a ''[[de facto]]'' ban on \"semi-automatic assault weapons\". Today, it can take up to two years to obtain a permit for the ownership of an FSL. The FSL was offered with full or folding stocks, plastic furniture and orthoptic sights.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n[[File:Soldadosargesperandodesembarco.jpg|thumb|right|Argentine soldiers armed with FAL, Falklands War]]\n\nArgentine FALs saw action during the [[Falklands War]] (Falklands-Malvinas/South Atlantic War), and in different peace-keeping operations such as in Cyprus and the former Yugoslavia. Rosario-made FALs are known to have been exported to Bolivia (in 1971), Colombia, Croatia (during the wars in former Yugoslavia during the 1990s), Honduras, Nigeria (this is unconfirmed, most Nigerian FALs are from FN in Belgium or are British-made L1A1s), Peru, and Uruguay (which reportedly took delivery of some Brazilian IMBEL-made FALs as well).{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Deactivated Argentinean FALs from the many thousands captured during the Falklands War are used by UK forces as part of the soldier's load on some training courses run over public land in the UK.\n\nThe [[Argentine Marine Corps]], a branch of the Argentine Navy, has replaced the FN/FM FAL in front line units, adopting the U.S. M16A2. The Argentine Army has expressed its desire to acquire at least 1,500 new rifles chambered for the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO SS109/U.S. M855 (.223 Remington) cartridge, to be used primarily by its peacekeeping troops on overseas deployments.\n\nThe US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) secretly purchased several thousand Argentine FAL rifles in 1981, which were supplied to the Nicaraguan [[Contras]] rebel group. These rifles have since appeared throughout Central America in use with other organizations.\n\nThese rifles are currently being modernized to a new standard, the FAL M5 (or FAL V), which uses polymer parts to reduce weight, and has [[Picatinny rails]] and optic mounts for carrying accessories, that created these variants:\n* '''FAMTD''': ''Fusil Argentino Modelo Tirador Destacado - Ca\u00f1\u00f3n Pesado'' (Argentine Designated Marksman Rifle - Heavy Barrel), [[Designated marksman rifle|DMR]] variant.

Troop field testing was performed with FN made FALs between 1958 and 1962. Then, in 1964, Brazil officially adopted the rifle, designating the rifle M964 for 1964. Licensed production started shortly thereafter at the ''[[IMBEL|Ind\u00fastria de Material B\u00e9lico do Brasil]]'' (IMBEL), in [[Itajub\u00e1]] in the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. The folding stock version was designated M964A1. By the late 1980s/early 1990s, IMBEL had manufactured some 200,000 M964 rifles. Later Brazilian made FALs have Type 3, hammer forged receivers. Early FN made FALs for Brazil are typical FN 1964 models with Type 1 or Type 2 receivers, plastic stock, handguard, and pistol grip, 22&nbsp;mm cylindrical flash hider for grenade launching, and plastic model \"D\" carrying handle. Brazilian-made FALs are thought to have been exported to Uruguay. A heavy barrel version, known as the FAP (Fuzil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado, or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon.[[File:Combatente da Caatinga (26607172042).jpg|left|thumb|[[Caatinga]] soldier of the Brazilian Army.]]\nBrazil's planned service weapon was a development of the FAL in 5.56\u00d745mm. Known as the MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, it was also manufactured by IMBEL. The first prototype, the MD-1, came out around 1983. In 1985, the MD-2 was presented and adopted by the [[Military Police]]. Its new 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambering aside, the MD-2/MD-3 is still very similar to the FAL and externally resembles it, changes include a change in the locking system, which was replaced by an M16-type rotating bolt. The MD-2 and MD-3 use [[STANAG magazine]]s, but have different buttstocks. The MD-2 features an FN 50.63 'para' side-folding stock, while the MD-3 uses the same fixed polymer stock of the standard FAL.\n\nHowever, Brazil's current service weapon is a Brazilian FAL-based assault rifle in 5.56\u00d745mm and 7.62\u00d751mm versions, with Assault Rifle and Carbine variants, including a Sniper and CQB rifle, called the [[IMBEL A2|IA2]], also produced by IMBEL.\n\nAlong with the IA2, MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, Brazil produces the M964A1/Pelopes (Special Operations Platoon), with an 11\" barrel, 3-point sling and a [[Picatinny rail]] with a [[tactical flashlight]] and sight.<ref>BASTOS, Carlos Stephani.

These weapons were intended for the ''[[German Federal Police|Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (border guard) and not the nascent ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' (army), which at the time used M1 Garands and M1/M2 carbines. In November 1956, however, West Germany ordered 100,000 additional FALs, designated the G1, for the army. FN made the rifles between April 1957 and May 1958. G1s served in the West German ''Bundeswehr'' for a relatively short time in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before they were replaced by the Spanish [[CETME]] Modelo 58 rifle in 1959 (which was extensively reworked into the later [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] rifle). The G1 featured a pressed metal handguard identical to the ones used on the Austrian Stg. 58, as well as the Dutch and Greek FALs, this being slightly slimmer than the standard wood or plastic handguards, and featuring horizontal lines running almost their entire length. G1s were also fitted with a unique removable prong flash hider, adding another external distinction. The main reason for the replacement of the G1 in Germany was the refusal of the Belgians to grant a license for production of the weapon in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|title=Europe|website=web.prm.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427012535/http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|archive-date=2017-04-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Many G1 FALs were passed on to Turkey after their withdrawal from German service.

Note the hinged butt plate.]]\n\nAfter the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) had to overcome several [[Military logistics|logistics problems]] which were a result of the wide variety of old firearms that were in service. In 1955 the IDF adopted the [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]]-produced [[Uzi]] submachine gun. To replace the German [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser Kar 98k]] and some British [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles, the IDF decided in the same year to adopt the FN FAL as its standard-issue infantry rifle, under the name ''Rov've Mitta'enn'' or ''Romat'' (\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\"\u05d8), an abbreviation of \"Self-Loading Rifle\". The FAL version ordered by the IDF came in two basic variants, both regular and heavy-barrel (automatic rifle), and were chambered for 7.62mm NATO ammunition. In common with heavy-barrel FALs used by several other nations, the Israeli 'heavy barrel' FAL (called the ''Makle'a Kal'', or ''Makleon'') was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode. The Israeli FALs were originally produced as selective-fire rifles, though later light-barrel rifle versions were altered to semi-automatic fire only. The Israeli models are recognizable by a distinctive handguard with a forward perforated sheet metal section, and a rear wood section unlike most other FALs in shape, and their higher 'Commonwealth'-type sights. Israel has been a keen user of rifle grenades, in particular the [[BT/AT 52|AT 52]] which is often seen in photographs with the FAL.<ref name=\"Cashner2013gren\">{{harvnb|Cashner|2013|pp=21\u201322|ps=:\"''The IDF has long been fond of the rifle grenade.

As far back as the 1960s, S.L.A. Marshall noted: \"Israel's infantry prefers the rifle-fired antitank grenade to the bazooka for shock effect on a group or bunker.

Following that country's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] in 1965, new rifles could not be readily procured from the UK, so Belgian FNs and South African R1s were imported instead.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The older L1s subsequently completed their service with the [[British South Africa Police]] and to a lesser extent territorial troops in the [[Rhodesia Regiment]] .<ref name=\"Fireforce\">{{cite book |last=Chris Cocks|authorlink=|title=Fireforce: One Man's War in the Rhodesian Light Infantry|edition=July 1, 2001|pages=139\u2013141 |publisher=Covos Day|isbn= 1-919874-32-1|date=2002-04-03}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], security forces fitted some standard FNs with customised [[flash suppressor]]s to reduce recoil on fully automatic fire. Rhodesian Security Forces seldom ever used the FN on automatic fire and were trained to use a \"double tap\" on semi-automatic in combat, as automatic fire was considered a total waste of ammunition. However, a few soldiers rejected these devices, which they claimed upset the balance of their weapons during close action.<ref name=\"Fireforce\"/> In this theatre, the FN was generally considered superior to the Soviet [[AK-47|Kalashnikovs]] or [[SKS]] carbines carried by communist-backed [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|PF]] insurgents.<ref name=\"Fireforce\"/>\n\nTrade sanctions and the gradual erosion of South African support in the 1970s led to serious part shortages.<ref name=\"SmithGB\">{{cite book|author= Smith, Ian|title=The Great Betrayal|pages=74\u201375|publisher= Blake Publishing Ltd.|location=London|year=1997|isbn=1-85782-176-9}}</ref> Consequently, shipments of [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3s]] were accepted from Portugal, although the security forces considered these less reliable than the FAL.<ref name=\"Fireforce\"/> Following [[Robert Mugabe]]'s ascension to power in 1980, Rhodesia's remaining FNs were passed on to [[Zimbabwe]], its successor state.<ref name=\"jones2009\">Jones, Richard D.

The FAL was originally designed to handle intermediate cartridges, but in an attempt to secure US favor for the rifle, the FAL was redesigned to use the newly developed 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The US tested several variants of the FAL to replace the M1 Garand. These rifles were tested against the T44, essentially an updated version of the basic Garand design.<ref name=\"STE\">Stevens, R.

The rifles were imported to the United States as fully automatic guns. Once in the U.S., the FAL's were \"de-militarized\" (upper receiver destroyed) to eliminate the rifles' character as an automatic rifle, as stipulated by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (GCA 68 currently prohibits the importation of foreign-made full-automatic rifles prior to the enactment of the Gun Control Act; semiautomatic versions of the same firearm were legal to import until the Semiautomatic Assault Rifle Ban of 1989). Thousands of the resulting \"parts kits\" were sold at generally low prices ($90 \u2013 $250) to hobbyists. The hobbyists rebuilt the parts kits to legal and functional semi-automatic rifles on new semi-automatic upper receivers. FAL rifles are still commercially available from a few domestic firms in semi-auto configuration: Entreprise Arms, DSArms, and [[Century International Arms]]. Century Arms created a semi-automatic version L1A1 with an [[IMBEL]] upper receiver and surplus British [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Enfield]] inch-pattern parts, while DSArms used Steyr-style metric-pattern FAL designs (this standard-metric difference means the Century Arms and DSArms firearms are not made from fully interchangeable batches of parts).\n\n===Venezuela===\nUntil recently, the FAL was the main service rifle of the Venezuelan army, made under license by [[CAVIM]].<ref name=\"CAVIM\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|title=A Recurrent Latin American Nightmare|accessdate=2010-04-01|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|author=Pablo Dreyfus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613045713/http://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-13|url-status=live}}</ref> The first batch of rifles to arrive in Venezuela were chambered in [[.280 British#Variants|7\u00d749mm]] (also known as 7&nbsp;mm Liviano or 7&nbsp;mm Venezuelan). Essentially a [[7\u00d757mm]] round shortened to intermediate length, this caliber was jointly developed by Venezuelan and Belgian engineers motivated by a global move towards intermediate calibers. The Venezuelans, who had been exclusively using the 7\u00d757mm round in their light and medium weapons since the turn of the 20th century, felt it was a perfect platform on which to base a calibre tailored to the particular rigours of the Venezuelan terrain.\n\nEventually the plan was dropped despite having ordered millions of rounds and thousands of weapons of this caliber. As the Cold War escalated, the military command felt it necessary to align with NATO despite not being a member, resulting in the adoption of the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge and the rechambering of the 5,000 or so FAL rifles that had already arrived in 7\u00d749mm by 1955-56.\n\nVenezuela has bought 100,000 [[AK-103]] assault rifles from Russia in order to replace the old FALs.<ref name=\"CAVIM\"/> Although the full shipment arrived by the end of 2006, the FAL will remain in service with the Venezuelan Reserve Forces and the Territorial Guard.\n\n==Conflicts==\n[[File:Patrol Kenya.jpg|thumb|[[British Army]] patrol crossing a stream during the [[Mau Mau rebellion]].

The [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] variant of the FAL was redesigned from FN's [[metre|metrical]] FAL into British [[imperial units]] and was produced under licence as the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1946, the first FAL prototype was completed. It was designed to fire the intermediate [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]] cartridge developed and used by the forces of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] during [[World War II]] (with the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]]). After testing this prototype in 1948, the [[British Army]] urged FN to build additional prototypes, including one in [[bullpup]] configuration, chambered for their new [[.280 British]] [7x43mm] caliber intermediate cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\">{{cite web|url=http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|title=FN FAL (Belgium)|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117172148/http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|archive-date=17 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> After evaluating the single bullpup prototype, FN decided to return instead to their original, conventional design for future production.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/>\n\nIn 1950, the United Kingdom presented the redesigned FN rifle and the British [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]], both in .280 British calibre, to the United States for comparison testing against the favoured [[United States Army]] design of the time\u2014Earle Harvey's T25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html|title=Earl Harvey's T-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325165934/http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html |archivedate= 25 March 2012|work=powmadeak47.com}}</ref> It was hoped that a common cartridge and rifle could be standardized for issue to the armies of all NATO member countries. After this testing was completed, U.S. Army officials suggested that FN should redesign their rifle to fire the U.S. prototype \".30 Light Rifle\" cartridge. FN decided to hedge their bets with the U.S., and in 1951 even made a deal that the U.S. could produce FALs royalty-free, given that the UK appeared to be favouring their own EM-2.\n\nThis decision appeared to be correct when the British Army decided to adopt the EM-2 (as Rifle No.9 Mk1) and .280 British cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/> This decision was later rescinded after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] lost the 1951 General Election and [[Winston Churchill]] returned as Prime Minister. It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that there was a [[quid pro quo]] agreement between Churchill and U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] in 1952 that the British accept the .30 Light Rifle cartridge as NATO standard in return for the U.S. acceptance of the FN FAL as NATO standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|title=The FN FAL Was Almost America's Battle Rifle|first=War Is|last=Boring|date=5 October 2014|access-date=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506202808/https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|archive-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The .30 Light Rifle cartridge was in fact later standardized as the 7.62&nbsp;mm NATO; however, the U.S. insisted on continued rifle tests. The FAL chambered for the .30 Light Rifle went up against the redesigned T25 (now redesignated as the T47), and an M1 Garand variant, the T44. Eventually, the T44 won, becoming the [[M14 rifle|M14]]. However, in the meantime, most other NATO countries were evaluating and selecting the FAL.\n\nFN created what is possibly the classic post-war [[battle rifle]]. Formally introduced by its designer [[Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive]] in 1951, and produced two years later, it has been described as the \"Right Arm of the Free World.\"{{sfn|Cashner|2013|p=5}} The FAL battle rifle has its [[Warsaw Pact]] counterpart in the [[AKM]], each being fielded by dozens of countries and produced in many of them. A few, such as Israel and South Africa, manufactured and issued both designs at various times. Unlike the Soviet AKM assault rifle, the FAL utilized a heavier full-power [[rifle]] [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]].\n\n==Design details==\n[[File:PISTONM16.gif|thumb|left|Short-stroke gas piston, the action used on the FAL.]]\n[[File:L1A1 FIELD STRIPPED.jpg|thumb|left|L1A1 British FAL variant field stripped.]]\n\nThe FAL operates by means of a [[gas-operated]] [[Firearm action|action]] very similar to that of the Russian [[SVT-40]]. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston housed above the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], and the locking mechanism is what is known as a ''tilting breechblock''. To lock, it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] much like the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolts]] of the Russian [[SKS]] [[carbine]] and French [[MAS-49]] series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the gas plug, to allow for the firing of [[rifle grenade]]s and manual operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|title=Tuning the FAL's Gas System|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112160722/http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|archive-date=12 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed [[Stock (firearms)|stock]] versions of the FAL, the [[recoil]] spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the receiver cover, necessitating a slightly different receiver cover, recoil spring, and bolt carrier, and a modified lower receiver for the stock.<ref name=\"popeneker\">Popeneker, Maxim & Williams, Anthony (2005). ''Assault Rifle''. The Crowood Press Ltd. {{ISBN|1-86126-700-2}}.</ref>\nFor field stripping the FAL can be opened. During opening the rifle pivots between the trigger guard and magazine well to give access to the action and piston system. This opening method causes a suboptimal iron sight line as the rear and front sight elements of the sight line are fixed to two different movable subassemblies. The sight radius for the FAL 50.00 and FAL 50.41 models is {{cvt|553|mm|1}} and for the 50.61 and FAL 50.63 models {{cvt|549|mm|in|1}}.\n \nFAL rifles have also been manufactured in both light and heavy-barrel configurations, with the heavy barrel intended for automatic fire as a section or squad light support weapon. Most heavy barrel FALs are equipped with [[bipod]]s, although some light barrel models were equipped with bipods, such as the Austrian StG58 and the German G1, and a bipod was later made available as an accessory.\n\nAmong other 7.62\u00d751mm NATO battle rifles at the time, the FN FAL had relatively light recoil, due to the user-adjustable gas system being able to be tuned via a regulator in fore-end of the rifle, which allowed for excess gas which would simply increase recoil to bleed off. The regulator is an adjustable gas port opening that adjusts the rifle to function reliably with various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior, making the FAL not ammunition specific. In fully automatic mode, however, the shooter receives considerable abuse from recoil, and the weapon climbs off-target quickly, making automatic fire only of marginal effectiveness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small arms visual encyclopedia|last=J.|first=Dougherty, Martin|publisher=Amber Books|year=2011|isbn=9781907446986|location=London|pages=222|oclc=751804871}}</ref> Many military forces using the FAL eventually eliminated full-automatic firearms training in the light-barrel FAL.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from FN FAL -->\n\n===FN production variants===\n\nDepending on the variant and the country of adoption, the FAL was issued as either [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] only or [[selective fire|select-fire]] (capable of both semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes).\n\n====LAR 50.41 & 50.42 (FAL HBAR & FALO)====\n* Also known as FALO as an abbreviation from the French ''Fusil Automatique Lourd'';\n* Heavy barrel for sustained fire with a 30-round magazine as a [[squad automatic weapon]];\n* Known in Canada as the C2A1, it was their primary squad automatic weapon until it was phased out during the 1980s in favor of the [[FN Minimi|C9]], which has better accuracy and higher ammunition capacity than the C2;\n* Known to the Australian Army as the L2A1, it was replaced by the FN Minimi.

Although the [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]] \"bullpup\" did well, American observers protested that the small-bore .280-caliber round lacked the power and range of a medium-bore .30-caliber round. British observers in return claimed the experimental American [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|.30-caliber T65 round]] [7.62\u00d751mm] was too powerful to control in automatic fire. Britain was forced to abandon the promising .280 round and adopt the American-designed .30-caliber T65 as the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The EM-2 couldn't be rechambered for the longer and more powerful cartridge and the Americans didn't yet have a working service rifle of their own.

The first 20,000 were manufactured by ''Fabrique Nationale d\u2019Armes de Guerre''-Herstal Belgique, but later the StG58 was manufactured under licence by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] (now [[Steyr Mannlicher]]), and was formerly the standard rifle of the [[Austrian Armed Forces|''\u00d6sterreichisches Bundesheer'']] (Austrian Federal Army). It is essentially a user-customized version of the FAL and is still in use, mainly as a drill weapon in the Austrian forces. It was selected in a 1958 competition, beating the Spanish [[CETME]] and American [[Armalite AR-10|AR-10]].\n\n[[File:West German FN FAL.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Two West German soldiers on a joint exercise in 1960. West Germany used the FN FAL designated as G1.]]\n\nMost StG 58s featured a folding bipod, and differ from the FAL by using a plastic [[stock (firearms)|stock]] rather than wood in order to reduce weight in the later production rifles (although some of the early FN-built production rifles did come with wooden stocks). The rifle can be distinguished from its Belgian and Argentine counterparts by its combination [[flash suppressor]] and [[grenade launcher]]. The foregrip was a two-part steel pressing.\n\nSteyr-built StG 58s had a hammer forged barrel that was considered to be the best barrel fitted to any FAL. Some StG58s had modifications made to the fire mode selector so that the fully automatic option was removed, leaving the selector with only safe and single-shot positions. The StG 58 was replaced by the [[Steyr AUG]] in 1977, although the StG 58 served with many units as the primary service rifle through the mid-1980s.\n\n====Olin/Winchester FAL====\nA semi-automatic, twin-barrel variant chambered in the 5.56mm Duplex round during [[Project SALVO]].

It comes with a 406&nbsp;mm (16&nbsp;in), 457&nbsp;mm (18&nbsp;in) or 533&nbsp;mm (21&nbsp;in) barrel, an [[Hiduminium|aluminum-alloy]] lower receiver, and improved [[Glass-filled polymer|Glass-filled]] [[Nylon]] furniture. Civilian models are semi-automatic, but military and Law Enforcement clients can procure select-fire models that have a fully automatic [[cyclic rate]] of 750 rounds/minute. The DSA-58 can use any metric-measurement FAL magazines, which come in 5, 10, 20 or 30-round capacities.\n* The '''DSA-58 OSW (''Operational Specialist Weapon'')''' is an assault carbine version of the paratrooper model of the FAL.

The FAL was also exported to many other countries, such as [[Venezuela]], where a small-arms industry produces some basically unchanged variants, as well as ammunition. By modern standards, one disadvantage of the FAL is the amount of work which goes into machining the complex receiver, bolt and bolt carrier. Some theorized that the movement of the tilting bolt mechanism tends to return differently with each shot, affecting inherent accuracy of the weapon, but this has been proven to be false. The FAL's receiver is machined, while most other modern military rifles use quicker stamping or casting techniques. Modern FALs have many improvements over those produced by FN and others in the mid-20th-century.\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 19.JPG|thumb|Weapons in the [[Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n]], [[Buenos Aires]]]]\n\nThe Argentine Armed Forces officially adopted the FN FAL in 1955, but the first FN made examples did not arrive in Argentina until the autumn of 1958. Subsequently, in 1960, licensed production of FALs began and continued until the mid-to-late 1990s, when production ceased. In 2010, a project to modernize all existing FAL and to produce an unknown number of them was approved. This project was called FAL M5.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nArgentine FALs were produced by the government-owned arsenal FM (Fabricaciones Militares) at the F\u00e1brica Militar de Armas Port\u00e1tiles \"Domingo Matheu\" (FMAP \"DM\") in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]. The acronym \"FAL\" was kept, its translation being \"Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Liviano\", (Light Automatic Rifle). Production weapons included \"Standard\" and \"Para\" (folding buttstock) versions. Military rifles were produced with the full auto fire option. The rifles were usually known as the FM FAL, for the \"Fabricaciones Militares\" brand name (FN and FM have a long-standing licensing and manufacturing agreement). A heavy barrel version, known as the ''FAP'' (''Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado'', or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon. The Argentine 'heavy barrel' FAL, also used by several other nations, was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode.\n\n[[Image:Bayoneta de FAL.JPG|thumb|left|150px|FAL [[bayonet]].]]\n\nA version of the FALMP III chambered in the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] cartridge was developed in the early 1980s. It used M16 type magazines but one version called the FALMP III 5.56mm Type 2 used [[Steyr AUG]] magazines. The [[FARA 83]] (Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Rep\u00fablica Argentina) was to replace the Argentine military's FAL rifles. The design borrowed features from the FAL such as the gas system and folding stock. It seems to have been also influenced to some degree by other rifles (the Beretta AR70/223, M16, and the [[IMI Galil|Galil]]). An estimated quantity of between 2,500 and 3,000 examples were produced for field testing, but military spending cuts killed the project in the mid-1980s.\n\nThere was also a semi-automatic\u2013only version, the ''FSL'', intended for the civilian market. Legislation changes in 1995 (namely, the enactment of ''Presidential Decree N\u00ba 64/95'') imposed a ''[[de facto]]'' ban on \"semi-automatic assault weapons\". Today, it can take up to two years to obtain a permit for the ownership of an FSL. The FSL was offered with full or folding stocks, plastic furniture and orthoptic sights.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n[[File:Soldadosargesperandodesembarco.jpg|thumb|right|Argentine soldiers armed with FAL, Falklands War]]\n\nArgentine FALs saw action during the [[Falklands War]] (Falklands-Malvinas/South Atlantic War), and in different peace-keeping operations such as in Cyprus and the former Yugoslavia. Rosario-made FALs are known to have been exported to Bolivia (in 1971), Colombia, Croatia (during the wars in former Yugoslavia during the 1990s), Honduras, Nigeria (this is unconfirmed, most Nigerian FALs are from FN in Belgium or are British-made L1A1s), Peru, and Uruguay (which reportedly took delivery of some Brazilian IMBEL-made FALs as well).{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Deactivated Argentinean FALs from the many thousands captured during the Falklands War are used by UK forces as part of the soldier's load on some training courses run over public land in the UK.\n\nThe [[Argentine Marine Corps]], a branch of the Argentine Navy, has replaced the FN/FM FAL in front line units, adopting the U.S. M16A2. The Argentine Army has expressed its desire to acquire at least 1,500 new rifles chambered for the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO SS109/U.S. M855 (.223 Remington) cartridge, to be used primarily by its peacekeeping troops on overseas deployments.\n\nThe US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) secretly purchased several thousand Argentine FAL rifles in 1981, which were supplied to the Nicaraguan [[Contras]] rebel group. These rifles have since appeared throughout Central America in use with other organizations.\n\nThese rifles are currently being modernized to a new standard, the FAL M5 (or FAL V), which uses polymer parts to reduce weight, and has [[Picatinny rails]] and optic mounts for carrying accessories, that created these variants:\n* '''FAMTD''': ''Fusil Argentino Modelo Tirador Destacado - Ca\u00f1\u00f3n Pesado'' (Argentine Designated Marksman Rifle - Heavy Barrel), [[Designated marksman rifle|DMR]] variant.

Troop field testing was performed with FN made FALs between 1958 and 1962. Then, in 1964, Brazil officially adopted the rifle, designating the rifle M964 for 1964. Licensed production started shortly thereafter at the ''[[IMBEL|Ind\u00fastria de Material B\u00e9lico do Brasil]]'' (IMBEL), in [[Itajub\u00e1]] in the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. The folding stock version was designated M964A1. By the late 1980s/early 1990s, IMBEL had manufactured some 200,000 M964 rifles. Later Brazilian made FALs have Type 3, hammer forged receivers. Early FN made FALs for Brazil are typical FN 1964 models with Type 1 or Type 2 receivers, plastic stock, handguard, and pistol grip, 22&nbsp;mm cylindrical flash hider for grenade launching, and plastic model \"D\" carrying handle. Brazilian-made FALs are thought to have been exported to Uruguay. A heavy barrel version, known as the FAP (Fuzil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado, or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon.[[File:Combatente da Caatinga (26607172042).jpg|left|thumb|[[Caatinga]] soldier of the Brazilian Army.]]\nBrazil's planned service weapon was a development of the FAL in 5.56\u00d745mm. Known as the MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, it was also manufactured by IMBEL. The first prototype, the MD-1, came out around 1983. In 1985, the MD-2 was presented and adopted by the [[Military Police]]. Its new 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambering aside, the MD-2/MD-3 is still very similar to the FAL and externally resembles it, changes include a change in the locking system, which was replaced by an M16-type rotating bolt. The MD-2 and MD-3 use [[STANAG magazine]]s, but have different buttstocks. The MD-2 features an FN 50.63 'para' side-folding stock, while the MD-3 uses the same fixed polymer stock of the standard FAL.\n\nHowever, Brazil's current service weapon is a Brazilian FAL-based assault rifle in 5.56\u00d745mm and 7.62\u00d751mm versions, with Assault Rifle and Carbine variants, including a Sniper and CQB rifle, called the [[IMBEL A2|IA2]], also produced by IMBEL.\n\nAlong with the IA2, MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, Brazil produces the M964A1/Pelopes (Special Operations Platoon), with an 11\" barrel, 3-point sling and a [[Picatinny rail]] with a [[tactical flashlight]] and sight.<ref>BASTOS, Carlos Stephani.

These weapons were intended for the ''[[German Federal Police|Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (border guard) and not the nascent ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' (army), which at the time used M1 Garands and M1/M2 carbines. In November 1956, however, West Germany ordered 100,000 additional FALs, designated the G1, for the army. FN made the rifles between April 1957 and May 1958. G1s served in the West German ''Bundeswehr'' for a relatively short time in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before they were replaced by the Spanish [[CETME]] Modelo 58 rifle in 1959 (which was extensively reworked into the later [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] rifle). The G1 featured a pressed metal handguard identical to the ones used on the Austrian Stg. 58, as well as the Dutch and Greek FALs, this being slightly slimmer than the standard wood or plastic handguards, and featuring horizontal lines running almost their entire length. G1s were also fitted with a unique removable prong flash hider, adding another external distinction. The main reason for the replacement of the G1 in Germany was the refusal of the Belgians to grant a license for production of the weapon in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|title=Europe|website=web.prm.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427012535/http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|archive-date=2017-04-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Many G1 FALs were passed on to Turkey after their withdrawal from German service.

Note the hinged butt plate.]]\n\nAfter the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) had to overcome several [[Military logistics|logistics problems]] which were a result of the wide variety of old firearms that were in service. In 1955 the IDF adopted the [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]]-produced [[Uzi]] submachine gun. To replace the German [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser Kar 98k]] and some British [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles, the IDF decided in the same year to adopt the FN FAL as its standard-issue infantry rifle, under the name ''Rov've Mitta'enn'' or ''Romat'' (\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\"\u05d8), an abbreviation of \"Self-Loading Rifle\". The FAL version ordered by the IDF came in two basic variants, both regular and heavy-barrel (automatic rifle), and were chambered for 7.62mm NATO ammunition. In common with heavy-barrel FALs used by several other nations, the Israeli 'heavy barrel' FAL (called the ''Makle'a Kal'', or ''Makleon'') was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode. The Israeli FALs were originally produced as selective-fire rifles, though later light-barrel rifle versions were altered to semi-automatic fire only. The Israeli models are recognizable by a distinctive handguard with a forward perforated sheet metal section, and a rear wood section unlike most other FALs in shape, and their higher 'Commonwealth'-type sights. Israel has been a keen user of rifle grenades, in particular the [[BT/AT 52|AT 52]] which is often seen in photographs with the FAL.<ref name=\"Cashner2013gren\">{{harvnb|Cashner|2013|pp=21\u201322|ps=:\"''The IDF has long been fond of the rifle grenade.

As far back as the 1960s, S.L.A. Marshall noted: \"Israel's infantry prefers the rifle-fired antitank grenade to the bazooka for shock effect on a group or bunker.

Following that country's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] in 1965, new rifles could not be readily procured from the UK, so Belgian FNs and South African R1s were imported instead.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The older L1s subsequently completed their service with the [[British South Africa Police]] and to a lesser extent territorial troops in the [[Rhodesia Regiment]] .<ref name=\"Fireforce\">{{cite book |last=Chris Cocks|authorlink=|title=Fireforce: One Man's War in the Rhodesian Light Infantry|edition=July 1, 2001|pages=139\u2013141 |publisher=Covos Day|isbn= 1-919874-32-1|date=2002-04-03}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], security forces fitted some standard FNs with customised [[flash suppressor]]s to reduce recoil on fully automatic fire. Rhodesian Security Forces seldom ever used the FN on automatic fire and were trained to use a \"double tap\" on semi-automatic in combat, as automatic fire was considered a total waste of ammunition. However, a few soldiers rejected these devices, which they claimed upset the balance of their weapons during close action.<ref name=\"Fireforce\"/> In this theatre, the FN was generally considered superior to the Soviet [[AK-47|Kalashnikovs]] or [[SKS]] carbines carried by communist-backed [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|PF]] insurgents.<ref name=\"Fireforce\"/>\n\nTrade sanctions and the gradual erosion of South African support in the 1970s led to serious part shortages.<ref name=\"SmithGB\">{{cite book|author= Smith, Ian|title=The Great Betrayal|pages=74\u201375|publisher= Blake Publishing Ltd.|location=London|year=1997|isbn=1-85782-176-9}}</ref> Consequently, shipments of [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3s]] were accepted from Portugal, although the security forces considered these less reliable than the FAL.<ref name=\"Fireforce\"/> Following [[Robert Mugabe]]'s ascension to power in 1980, Rhodesia's remaining FNs were passed on to [[Zimbabwe]], its successor state.<ref name=\"jones2009\">Jones, Richard D.

The FAL was originally designed to handle intermediate cartridges, but in an attempt to secure US favor for the rifle, the FAL was redesigned to use the newly developed 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The US tested several variants of the FAL to replace the M1 Garand. These rifles were tested against the T44, essentially an updated version of the basic Garand design.<ref name=\"STE\">Stevens, R.

The rifles were imported to the United States as fully automatic guns. Once in the U.S., the FAL's were \"de-militarized\" (upper receiver destroyed) to eliminate the rifles' character as an automatic rifle, as stipulated by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (GCA 68 currently prohibits the importation of foreign-made full-automatic rifles prior to the enactment of the Gun Control Act; semiautomatic versions of the same firearm were legal to import until the Semiautomatic Assault Rifle Ban of 1989). Thousands of the resulting \"parts kits\" were sold at generally low prices ($90 \u2013 $250) to hobbyists. The hobbyists rebuilt the parts kits to legal and functional semi-automatic rifles on new semi-automatic upper receivers. FAL rifles are still commercially available from a few domestic firms in semi-auto configuration: Entreprise Arms, DSArms, and [[Century International Arms]]. Century Arms created a semi-automatic version L1A1 with an [[IMBEL]] upper receiver and surplus British [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Enfield]] inch-pattern parts, while DSArms used Steyr-style metric-pattern FAL designs (this standard-metric difference means the Century Arms and DSArms firearms are not made from fully interchangeable batches of parts).\n\n===Venezuela===\nUntil recently, the FAL was the main service rifle of the Venezuelan army, made under license by [[CAVIM]].<ref name=\"CAVIM\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|title=A Recurrent Latin American Nightmare|accessdate=2010-04-01|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|author=Pablo Dreyfus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613045713/http://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-13|url-status=live}}</ref> The first batch of rifles to arrive in Venezuela were chambered in [[.280 British#Variants|7\u00d749mm]] (also known as 7&nbsp;mm Liviano or 7&nbsp;mm Venezuelan). Essentially a [[7\u00d757mm]] round shortened to intermediate length, this caliber was jointly developed by Venezuelan and Belgian engineers motivated by a global move towards intermediate calibers. The Venezuelans, who had been exclusively using the 7\u00d757mm round in their light and medium weapons since the turn of the 20th century, felt it was a perfect platform on which to base a calibre tailored to the particular rigours of the Venezuelan terrain.\n\nEventually the plan was dropped despite having ordered millions of rounds and thousands of weapons of this caliber. As the Cold War escalated, the military command felt it necessary to align with NATO despite not being a member, resulting in the adoption of the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge and the rechambering of the 5,000 or so FAL rifles that had already arrived in 7\u00d749mm by 1955-56.\n\nVenezuela has bought 100,000 [[AK-103]] assault rifles from Russia in order to replace the old FALs.<ref name=\"CAVIM\"/> Although the full shipment arrived by the end of 2006, the FAL will remain in service with the Venezuelan Reserve Forces and the Territorial Guard.\n\n==Conflicts==\n[[File:Patrol Kenya.jpg|thumb|[[British Army]] patrol crossing a stream during the [[Mau Mau rebellion]].

The old altar at the Assumption Orthodox Cathedral is made of special wood with the metallic decorations and the religious paintings.\n\nThe Holy Trinity Orthodox Church was founded in the early 17th century. The first written memories about the Assumption Orthodox Cathedral (the St. Uspensky Orthodox Church), which was created at the Trinity Orthodox Church place, are related to 1719. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The interesting fact is that the new architectural design of the St. Uspensky Orthodox Cathedral was developed, and then, the actual cathedral was constructed, using the stone, in 1755 \u2013 1757. As it is described in the historical documents in 1771 and 1783, the Assumption Orthodox Cathedral had a high altar with the Savior icon and the two other altars.\n\nVasyl Matkovsky was a priest at the Assumption Orthodox Church in Bar on that time. In 1795\u20131809, Ioan Sinitsky became a priest at the Assumption Orthodox Church in Bar. At the same time, Fedir Batulinsky, priest (1800\u20131802) and Stefan Batulinsky, priest (1804\u20131820) conducted their religious missions at the Assumption Orthodox Church in Bar. Pavlo Batulinsky (1838\u20131844) served as a priest at the Assumption Orthodox Church in Bar, and then he became a key owner and a cathedral bishop in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi|Kamyanets]] soon after that. Vasyl Kuzminsky, as a priest in 1844\u20131849 and Simeon Karchevsky, as a priest in 1849\u20131861 worked to continue the religious missions at the Assumption Orthodox Church in Bar. In addition, Simeon Karchevsky was a head of the Bar Orthodox Religion School at the same time. Hryhoriy Yankovsky, as a priest in 1861\u20131881, Ivan Korchynsky, as a priest (1881\u20131892), Pavlo Savluchynsky, as a priest (1892), Afanasiy Dvernytsky, as a priest (1892\u2013) were recognized for their outstanding religious mission services at the Assumption Orthodox Church in Bar.\n\nThe Assumption Orthodox Church was closed for the renovation in 1838\u20131851. The full restoration of the Assumption Cathedral was also done in 1975. The \u201cgold plated\u201d domes were installed and the fa\u00e7ade renovation works were completed at the Assumption Orthodox Cathedral in 2013. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nAt present time, there are the two old icons at the Assumption Orthodox Cathedral in Bar, Ukraine: The St. Michael Myrlikiys\u2019ky Miracle Man icon, created in Bari, Italy in the 16th century and presented by [[Bona Sforza]]; and The God's Mother icon with the silver frame, created in the 17th century, which saved the cathedral from the fire in 1737 and

The old altar at the Assumption Orthodox Cathedral is made of special wood with the metallic decorations and the religious paintings.\n\nThe Holy Trinity Orthodox Church was founded in the early 17th century. The first written memories about the Assumption Orthodox Cathedral (the St. Uspensky Orthodox Church), which was created at the Trinity Orthodox Church place, are related to 1719. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The interesting fact is that the new architectural design of the St. Uspensky Orthodox Cathedral was developed, and then, the actual cathedral was constructed, using the stone, in 1755 \u2013 1757. As it is described in the historical documents in 1771 and 1783, the Assumption Orthodox Cathedral had a high altar with the Savior icon and the two other altars.\n\nVasyl Matkovsky was a priest at the Assumption Orthodox Church in Bar on that time. In 1795\u20131809, Ioan Sinitsky became a priest at the Assumption Orthodox Church in Bar. At the same time, Fedir Batulinsky, priest (1800\u20131802) and Stefan Batulinsky, priest (1804\u20131820) conducted their religious missions at the Assumption Orthodox Church in Bar. Pavlo Batulinsky (1838\u20131844) served as a priest at the Assumption Orthodox Church in Bar, and then he became a key owner and a cathedral bishop in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi|Kamyanets]] soon after that.
