Brazilian soprano [[Bidu Say\u00e3o]] was the featured soloist on the unusual recording, which was released on both LP and reel-to-reel tape.\n\nUnited Artists releases included soundtracks from the James Bond movies, ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' starring [[the Beatles]] (1964), ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965),  ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1966), ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'' (1971), and ''[[Man of La Mancha (film)|Man of La Mancha]]'' (1972). The soundtrack album of United Artists's ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961) was released by [[Columbia Records]], which had also released the Broadway cast album. Also, the American version of the soundtrack album of United Artists's ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' (1965), also starring the Beatles, was released on [[Capitol Records]].\n\nAs [[Henry Mancini]] was signed to RCA Victor, that company handled the soundtracks of the United Artists films that he composed the music for, most notably ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]''; exceptions include ''[[Gaily, Gaily]]'', ''[[The Hawaiians (film)|The Hawaiians]]'', ''[[The Pink Panther Strikes Again]]'' and ''[[Revenge of the Pink Panther]]''. Many of these soundtracks have reverted to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], whose [[MGM Music]] unit licensed them to other labels for reissue, first [[Rykodisc]], then [[Universal Music]] and EMI. As owner of Columbia and RCA Victor, Sony released the ''West Side Story'' original cast album and film soundtrack on CD. Sony has owned most of Mancini's soundtrack albums since its music division's merger with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] in 2004.\n[[File:UnitedArtistsRecords.jpg|left|thumb|An earlier version of the United Artists Records logo used from 1960 through 1968]]\nThe label produced rock and roll and R&B hits from 1959 and into the 1960s by [[the Clovers]], [[Marv Johnson]], [[the Falcons]], [[the Exciters]], [[Patty Duke]], [[the Delicates]], [[Bobby Goldsboro]], [[Jay and the Americans]], and later [[Manfred Mann]] and [[the Easybeats]]. [[Berry Gordy]] placed a number of early [[Motown Records|Motown]] acts with United Artists, including Marv Johnson and [[Eddie Holland]] in 1959. [[Jerry Leiber]] and [[Mike Stoller]] were hired to produce artists signed to the label after they left Atlantic. These included the Exciters, [[Bobby Goldsboro]], [[Jay and the Americans]], the Clovers, and Mike Clifford. United Artists covered folk music when it added [[Gordon Lightfoot]] to its roster and easy listening with the addition of piano duo [[Ferrante & Teicher]].\n\nUnited Artists' involvement with jazz was significant. The company hired [[Alan Douglas (record producer)|Alan Douglas]] in 1960 to run its jazz division.<ref name=\"Pouncey\">{{cite magazine |last=Pouncey|first=Edwin |date=July 1997|title=The Man Who Sold the Underworld |magazine=The Wire|page=27 }}</ref>  Other producers were [[George Wein]], Jack Lewis, and [[Tom Wilson (record producer)|Tom Wilson]].

Unart was created in 1958 and was in operation until 1959, producing singles by vocal groups, then was recreated in 1967 for budget albums.\n\nIn 1966 United Artists acquired the masters of [[Sue Records]], an R&B and soul record label in New York City which produced [[Ike & Tina Turner]], [[Baby Washington]], and jazz organist [[Jimmy McGriff]]. Some material produced by Sue was reissued on Unart.\n\nUnited Artists produced a series of children's records under the \"[[Tale Spinners for Children]]\" name throughout the 1960s. These were album-length adaptations of classic fairy tales and children's stories done in an audio drama format.\n\n===Other UA labels===\n[[United Artists Special Projects]] were budget records designed for product and movie tie-ins. Examples are ''[[The Incredible World of James Bond#Record album|The Incredible World of James Bond]]'', an album sold by Pepsi Cola and Frito Lay of cover version themes and original soundtrack music of the first three James Bond films, and ''Music from Marlboro Country'', various cover versions of the theme to ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' and original soundtrack music from [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s ''[[Return of the Seven]]'' that was sold by [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] as a tie-in to its Marlboro cigarette brand.\n\n===Merger===\n[[File:UA liberty vector 1968.svg|right|thumb|United Artists Records used this logo from 1968 to 1971 when it was co-owned with Liberty Records.]]\nIn 1969, United Artists merged with co-owned [[Liberty Records]] and its subsidiary, [[Imperial Records]]. In 1971, Liberty/UA Records dropped the Liberty name in favor of United Artists.<ref name=\"absorbs\">{{cite web|title=UA Corp Absorbs Lines; UA Records Sole Disk Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3|magazine=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|accessdate=23 September 2017|date=23 January 1971}}</ref>\n\nMainstream pop acts were signed to the label, among them [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], the [[Spencer Davis Group]], [[Peter Sarstedt]], [[Shirley Bassey]], and [[War (American band)|War]]. The label attempted to update the style of 1950s rock group [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] with a 1968 single. After UA bought [[Mediarts Records]], the roster grew to include [[Don McLean]], [[Merrilee Rush]], [[Paul Anka]], [[Chris Rea]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Bill Conti]], [[Northern Calloway]], [[Johnny Rivers]], [[Ike & Tina Turner]], [[Gerry Rafferty]], and [[Crystal Gayle]]. Later, through a distribution deal with [[Jet Records]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]] was signed. UA also distributed the otherwise-independent [[Grateful Dead Records]] in the early-to-mid 1970s.\n\nIn England, [[Andrew Lauder (music executive)|Andrew Lauder]], who had been head of A&R at the UK branch of Liberty Records, transferred to UA when Liberty was shut down in 1971. His signings included [[the Groundhogs]], [[Aynsley Dunbar]] (only in the UK), [[Hawkwind]], [[Bonzo Dog Band]], [[Brinsley Schwarz]], [[Man (band)|Man]] (all originally Liberty artists), [[High Tide (band)|High Tide]], [[Help Yourself (band)|Help Yourself]], [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]], [[the Buzzcocks]], [[the Stranglers]] and [[999 (band)|999]]. He also licensed UK releases for several influential German bands during the early 70s, the best known of which were [[Can (band)|Can]], [[Neu!]] and [[Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II]]. Lauder left UA in late 1977 to help found [[Radar Records]].\n\nThe label's most successful artist was country artist [[Kenny Rogers]] who signed to UA in the mid-1970s, enjoying a long string of hit singles and albums.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1970s the company was known as United Artists Music and Records Group (UAMARG).\n\n===Sale to EMI===\nIn 1978, UA executives Artie Mogull and Jerry Rubinstein bought the record company from Transamerica with a loan from [[EMI]], which took over distribution of the label. The official name of the company was changed to Liberty/United Records, but the United Artists Records name was retained under license. The deal led to an immediate setback, as the change of ownership allowed [[Jet Records]] to end its relationship with UA and switch its distribution to [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]], with the Jet back catalog transferring to CBS distribution as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT3|title=ELO 'Out Of Blue' Hassle Heating Up|magazine=Billboard|date=10 February 1979|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|accessdate=16 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT101 |title=Jet In Global Pact |magazine=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |date=1 July 1978 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> UA dumped many ELO albums into the [[Cut-out (recording industry)|cutout]] market, which CBS was unable to prevent.<ref name=\"cutout\">{{cite web|title=Cutout Material Is Plentiful at NARM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT125|magazine=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|accessdate=7 January 2012|language=en|date=7 April 1979}}</ref> However, CBS reissues of early ELO albums through ''[[Out of the Blue (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Out of the Blue]]'' (1977) contained copyright notices for United Artists Music and Records Group.

Two significant exceptions were a couple of Beatles albums not previously controlled by EMI in the United States: the ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)#North American release|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964) soundtrack album, and ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' (1970). The ''Let It Be'' album was actually released by [[Apple Records]] in both the UK and the US but because the movie had been distributed by United Artists Pictures, in America the album was distributed by United Artists rather than EMI.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8 |title=Beatlemania Returning As 'Let It Be' Clicking |magazine=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |date=6 June 1970 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> Both previously non-EMI Beatles albums were reissued on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] label, which already controlled the rest of the Beatles' catalog in the United States.\n\n===UAR today===\nWhen producer [[Jerry Weintraub]] was enlisted to revive the [[United Artists]] movie studio in 1986, he attempted to revive the United Artists Records label as well. However, only one album was released: the soundtrack for ''[[The Karate Kid Part II]]'', a film Weintraub had produced for [[Columbia Pictures]] before being hired at UA. A single from the movie's soundtrack, Mancrab's \"Fish for Life,\" was also released on United Artists Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/ws46201us|title=Mancrab - Fish For Life|publisher=45cat|accessdate=30 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe United Artists catalog is controlled by Capitol Records, now part of [[Universal Music Group]] (who also owns the non-soundtrack catalog of [[MGM Records]], once owned by UA's current parent [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWUil8OuXS8C|title=The Music Business and Recording Industry: Delivering Music in the 21st Century|last=Hull|first=Geoffrey P.|last2=Hutchison|first2=Thomas William|last3=Strasser|first3=Richard|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9780415875608|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/mgm/mgmstory.html|title=The MGM Records Story|website=bsnpubs.com|access-date=25 March 2016}}</ref> Capitol Records also has the rights to soundtrack albums UA Records released under license from [[MGM Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ICM5O4 |title=Rocky [Original Motion Picture Score&#93;: Bill Conti: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref>  The catalog of British acts who were signed to the British branch of UA Records is today controlled by the [[Parlophone]] unit of [[Warner Music Group]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/warner-music-group-integrates-parlophone-667019 |title=Warner Music Group Integrates Parlophone Roster, Including Coldplay, David Guetta and Pink Floyd |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2016}}</ref> with North American distribution by [[Rhino Entertainment]].\n\n==Roster==\n<!-- Please add names in alphabetical order -->\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[999 (band)|999]]\n* [[A Band Called O]]\n* [[Morris Albert]]\n* [[Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II]]\n* [[The Animals]] (Jet)\n* [[The Angels (American group)|The Angels]] (Ascot)\n* [[Paul Anka]]\n* [[B.

Brazilian soprano [[Bidu Say\u00e3o]] was the featured soloist on the unusual recording, which was released on both LP and reel-to-reel tape.\n\nUnited Artists releases included soundtracks from the James Bond movies, ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' starring [[the Beatles]] (1964), ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965),  ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1966), ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'' (1971), and ''[[Man of La Mancha (film)|Man of La Mancha]]'' (1972). The soundtrack album of United Artists's ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961) was released by [[Columbia Records]], which had also released the Broadway cast album. Also, the American version of the soundtrack album of United Artists's ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' (1965), also starring the Beatles, was released on [[Capitol Records]].\n\nAs [[Henry Mancini]] was signed to RCA Victor, that company handled the soundtracks of the United Artists films that he composed the music for, most notably ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]''; exceptions include ''[[Gaily, Gaily]]'', ''[[The Hawaiians (film)|The Hawaiians]]'', ''[[The Pink Panther Strikes Again]]'' and ''[[Revenge of the Pink Panther]]''. Many of these soundtracks have reverted to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], whose [[MGM Music]] unit licensed them to other labels for reissue, first [[Rykodisc]], then [[Universal Music]] and EMI. As owner of Columbia and RCA Victor, Sony released the ''West Side Story'' original cast album and film soundtrack on CD. Sony has owned most of Mancini's soundtrack albums since its music division's merger with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] in 2004.\n[[File:UnitedArtistsRecords.jpg|left|thumb|An earlier version of the United Artists Records logo used from 1960 through 1968]]\nThe label produced rock and roll and R&B hits from 1959 and into the 1960s by [[the Clovers]], [[Marv Johnson]], [[the Falcons]], [[the Exciters]], [[Patty Duke]], [[the Delicates]], [[Bobby Goldsboro]], [[Jay and the Americans]], and later [[Manfred Mann]] and [[the Easybeats]]. [[Berry Gordy]] placed a number of early [[Motown Records|Motown]] acts with United Artists, including Marv Johnson and [[Eddie Holland]] in 1959. [[Jerry Leiber]] and [[Mike Stoller]] were hired to produce artists signed to the label after they left Atlantic. These included the Exciters, [[Bobby Goldsboro]], [[Jay and the Americans]], the Clovers, and Mike Clifford. United Artists covered folk music when it added [[Gordon Lightfoot]] to its roster and easy listening with the addition of piano duo [[Ferrante & Teicher]].\n\nUnited Artists involvement with jazz was significant. The company hired [[Alan Douglas (record producer)|Alan Douglas]] in 1960 to run its jazz division.<ref name=\"Pouncey\">{{cite web |last= Pouncey|first=Edwin |date=July 1997|title=The Man Who Sold the Underworld |magazine=The Wire|page=27 }}</ref>  Other producers were [[George Wein]], Jack Lewis, and [[Tom Wilson (record producer)|Tom Wilson]].

Unart was created in 1958 and was in operation until 1959, producing singles by vocal groups, then was recreated in 1967 for budget albums.\n\nIn 1966 United Artists acquired the masters of [[Sue Records]], an R&B and soul record label in New York City which produced [[Ike & Tina Turner]], [[Baby Washington]], and jazz organist [[Jimmy McGriff]]. Some material produced by Sue was reissued on Unart.\n\nUnited Artists produced a series of children's records under the \"[[Tale Spinners for Children]]\" name throughout the 1960s. These were album-length adaptations of classic fairy tales and children's stories done in an audio drama format.\n\n===Other UA labels===\n[[United Artists Special Projects]] were budget records designed for product and movie tie-ins. Examples are ''[[The Incredible World of James Bond#Record album|The Incredible World of James Bond]]'', an album sold by Pepsi Cola and Frito Lay of cover version themes and original soundtrack music of the first three James Bond films, and ''Music from Marlboro Country'', various cover versions of the theme to ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' and original soundtrack music from [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s ''[[Return of the Seven]]'' that was sold by [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] as a tie-in to its Marlboro cigarette brand.\n\n===Merger===\n[[File:UA liberty vector 1968.svg|right|thumb|United Artists Records used this logo from 1968 to 1971 when it was co-owned with Liberty Records.]]\nIn 1969, United Artists merged with co-owned [[Liberty Records]] and its subsidiary, [[Imperial Records]]. In 1971, Liberty/UA Records dropped the Liberty name in favor of United Artists.<ref name=\"absorbs\">{{cite web|title=UA Corp Absorbs Lines; UA Records Sole Disk Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3|magazine=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|accessdate=23 September 2017|date=23 January 1971}}</ref>\n\nMainstream pop acts were signed to the label, among them [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], the [[Spencer Davis Group]], [[Peter Sarstedt]], [[Shirley Bassey]], and [[War (American band)|War]]. The label attempted to update the style of 1950s rock group [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] with a 1968 single. After UA bought [[Mediarts Records]], the roster grew to include [[Don McLean]], [[Merrilee Rush]], [[Paul Anka]], [[Chris Rea]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Bill Conti]], [[Northern Calloway]], [[Johnny Rivers]], [[Ike & Tina Turner]], [[Gerry Rafferty]], and [[Crystal Gayle]]. Later, through a distribution deal with [[Jet Records]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]] was signed. UA also distributed the otherwise-independent [[Grateful Dead Records]] in the early-to-mid 1970s.\n\nIn England, [[Andrew Lauder (music executive)|Andrew Lauder]], who had been head of A&R at the UK branch of Liberty Records, transferred to UA when Liberty was shut down in 1971. His signings included [[the Groundhogs]], [[Aynsley Dunbar]] (only in the UK), [[Hawkwind]], [[Bonzo Dog Band]], [[Brinsley Schwarz]], [[Man (band)|Man]] (all originally Liberty artists), [[High Tide (band)|High Tide]], [[Help Yourself (band)|Help Yourself]], [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]], [[the Buzzcocks]], [[the Stranglers]] and [[999 (band)|999]]. He also licensed UK releases for several influential German bands during the early 70s, the best known of which were [[Can (band)|Can]], [[Neu!]] and [[Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II]]. Lauder left UA in late 1977 to help found [[Radar Records]].\n\nThe label's most successful artist was country artist [[Kenny Rogers]] who signed to UA in the mid-1970s, enjoying a long string of hit singles and albums.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1970s the company was known as United Artists Music and Records Group (UAMARG).\n\n===Sale to EMI===\nIn 1978, UA executives Artie Mogull and Jerry Rubinstein bought the record company from Transamerica with a loan from [[EMI]], which took over distribution of the label. The official name of the company was changed to Liberty/United Records, but the United Artists Records name was retained under license. The deal led to an immediate setback, as the change of ownership allowed [[Jet Records]] to end its relationship with UA and switch its distribution to [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]], with the Jet back catalog transferring to CBS distribution as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT3|title=ELO 'Out Of Blue' Hassle Heating Up|magazine=Billboard|date=10 February 1979|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|accessdate=16 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT101 |title=Jet In Global Pact |magazine=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |date=1 July 1978 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> UA dumped many ELO albums into the [[Cut-out (recording industry)|cutout]] market, which CBS was unable to prevent.<ref name=\"cutout\">{{cite web|title=Cutout Material Is Plentiful at NARM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT125|magazine=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|accessdate=7 January 2012|language=en|date=7 April 1979}}</ref> However, CBS reissues of early ELO albums through ''[[Out of the Blue (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Out of the Blue]]'' (1977) contained copyright notices for United Artists Music and Records Group.

The ''Let It Be'' album was actually released by [[Apple Records]] in both the UK and the US but because the movie had been distributed by United Artists Pictures, in America the album was distributed by United Artists rather than EMI.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8 |title=Beatlemania Returning As 'Let It Be' Clicking |magazine=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |date=6 June 1970 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> Both previously non-EMI Beatles albums were reissued on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] label, which already controlled the rest of the Beatles' catalog in the United States.\n\n===UAR today===\nWhen producer [[Jerry Weintraub]] was enlisted to revive the [[United Artists]] movie studio in 1986, he attempted to revive the United Artists Records label as well. However, only one album was released: the soundtrack for ''[[The Karate Kid Part II]]'', a film Weintraub had produced for [[Columbia Pictures]] before being hired at UA.

The Chinese word \n''sh\u01d4\u200b'' ([[wiktionary:\u9f20|\u9f20]]) refers to various types of [[Muroidea]], such as [[rat]]s and [[mouse|mice]]. The term \"[[wiktionary:zodiac|zodiac]]\" ultimately derives from an [[Ancient Greek]] term referring to a \"circle of little animals\". There are also a yearly month of the rat and a daily hour of the rat ([[Traditional Chinese timekeeping#Dual hour: Sh\u00ed|Chinese double hour]], midnight, 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 1:00&nbsp;a.m.). Years of the rat are cyclically differentiated by correlation to the [[Heavenly Stems]] cycle, resulting in a repeating cycle of five years of the rat (over a sixty-year period), each rat year also being associated with one of the Chinese [[wu xing]], also known as the \"five elements\", or \"phases\": the \"Five Phases\" being [[Fire (Wu Xing)|Fire]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u706b}} ''hu\u01d2''), [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u6c34}} ''shu\u01d0''), [[Wood (Wu Xing)|Wood]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u6728}} ''m\u00f9''), [[Metal (Wu Xing)|Metal]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u91d1}} ''j\u012bn''), and [[Earth (Wu Xing)|Earth]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u571f}} ''t\u01d4'').\n\n==First Year of the Rat==\n[[File:\u9f20-oracle.svg|thumb|30px|The ancient [[Oracle bone script|shell end bone]] style Chinese character ''sh\u01d4'' (\u9f20), for rat/mouse]]\n\nIn Chinese tradition, the first year was the equivalent of 2637 BCE (although others give other dates). The Prime Minister of the first emperor, [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]] is said in this year to have worked out the [[Sexagenary cycle|sixty year]] zodiacal cycle.

According to one version of this tale, the emperor's advisors selected twelve candidates from among the animal types, including the rat and the cat. The winner was to be selected based upon merit, as to personal appearance, lifestyle, and contributions to the world. Before the competition, the cat asked the rat for a wake up call in order to get to the show on time; however, the rat apprehensive of the competition, especially as to the cat's apparent beauty, did not wake the cat, who then overslept (and, ever afterwards, the embittered cat became a ratter and a mouser). The Jade Emperor mystified as to why there were only eleven candidate animals to show up inquired of his servants. These servants hastily acquired the first possible replacement animal which they encountered, (a [[pig (Zodiac)|pig]]). After the start of the competition, the rat achieved first place by performing on the flute while upon the back of the [[ox (zodiac)|ox]]. Impressed, the Jade Emperor placed the rat at the beginning of the twelve-year cycle (and the ox second, for being so generous as to allow the rat to play the flute upon the ox's back). Then the other animals were placed in order according to the Jade Emperor's judgment.<ref>Alston, Isabella and Kathryn Dixon (2014). ''Chinese Zodiac''.

The Chinese word \n''sh\u01d4\u200b'' ([[wiktionary:\u9f20|\u9f20]]) refers to various types of [[Muroidea]], such as [[rat]]s and [[mouse|mice]].

According to one version of this tale, the emperor's advisors selected twelve candidates from among the animal types, including the rat and the cat. The winner was to be selected based upon merit, as to personal appearance, lifestyle, and contributions to the world. Before the competition, the cat asked the rat for a wake up call in order to get to the show on time; however, the rat apprehensive of the competition, especially as to the cat's apparent beauty, did not wake the cat, who then overslept (and, ever afterwards, the embittered cat became a ratter and a mouser). The Jade Emperor mystified as to why there were only eleven candidate animals to show up inquired of his servants. These servants hastily acquired the first possible replacement animal which they encountered, (a [[pig (Zodiac)|pig]]). After the start of the competition, the rat achieved first place by performing on the flute while upon the back of the [[ox (zodiac)|ox]]. Impressed, the Jade Emperor placed the rat at the beginning of the twelve-year cycle (and the ox second, for being so generous as to allow the rat to play the flute upon the ox's back). Then the other animals were placed in order according to the Jade Emperor's judgment.<ref>Alston, Isabella and Kathryn Dixon (2014). ''Chinese Zodiac''.
