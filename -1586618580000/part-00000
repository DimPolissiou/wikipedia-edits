[[Submarine Warfare insignia|Qualified in submarines]] during his early years, he later oversaw the conversion of these vessels' propulsion from gasoline to diesel, and then later was key in acquiring approval to build the world's first [[Nuclear propulsion|nuclear-powered]] submarine, {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, whose propulsion system later completely superseded [[Diesel engine|diesel-powered]] submarines in the US. He also, beginning in 1917, was the Navy's leading developer of [[underway replenishment]] techniques, the tool which during the Pacific war would allow the US fleet to operate away from port almost indefinitely. The chief of the Navy's [[Bureau of Navigation (United States Navy)|Bureau of Navigation]] in 1939, Nimitz served as [[Chief of Naval Operations]] from 1945 until 1947. He was the United States' last surviving officer who served in the rank of fleet admiral.\n\n==Early life and education==\nNimitz, a [[German Texan]], was born the son of Anna Josephine (Henke) and Chester Bernhard Nimitz on February 24, 1885, in [[Fredericksburg, Texas]],<ref>Potter, p. 26.</ref> where his grandfather's hotel is now the [[Admiral Nimitz State Historic Site]].

His congressman, [[James L. Slayden]], told him that he had one appointment available for the [[United States Naval Academy]] and that he would award it to the best qualified candidate. Nimitz felt that this was his only opportunity for further education and spent extra time studying to earn the appointment. He was appointed to the Naval Academy from [[Texas's 12th congressional district]] in 1901, and he graduated with distinction on January 30, 1905, seventh in a class of 114.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Fleet Admiral Chester W.

In September 1906, he was transferred to the cruiser {{USS|Baltimore|C-3|2}}; on January 31, 1907, after the two years at sea as a [[warrant officer]] then required by law, he was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]. Remaining on Asiatic Station in 1907, he successively served on the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Panay|1899|2}}, [[destroyer]] {{USS|Decatur|DD-5|2}}, and cruiser {{USS|Denver|CL-16|2}}.\n\nThe destroyer ''Decatur'' [[Ship grounding|ran aground]] on a mud bank in the Philippines on July 7, 1908 while under the command of Ensign Nimitz.

In May of that year, he was given command of the flotilla, with additional duty in command of {{USS|Plunger|SS-2|6}}, later renamed ''A-1''.   He was promoted directly from ensign to lieutenant in January 1910.  He commanded {{USS|Snapper|SS-16|6}} (later renamed ''C-5'') when that submarine was commissioned on February 2, 1910, and on November 18, 1910 assumed command of {{USS|Narwhal|SS-17|6}} (later renamed ''D-1'').<ref name=\"navy-ship-nimitz\" />\n\nIn the latter command, he had additional duty from October 10, 1911 as Commander 3rd Submarine Division Atlantic Torpedo Fleet. In November 1911, he was ordered to the [[Boston Navy Yard]], to assist in fitting out {{USS|Skipjack|SS-24|6}} and assumed command of that submarine, which had been renamed ''E-1'', at her commissioning on February 14, 1912. On the [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]] [[USS Nevada (BM-8)|''Tonopah'']] (then employed as a submarine tender) on March 20, 1912, he rescued Fireman Second Class W. J. Walsh from drowning, receiving a [[Silver Lifesaving Medal]] for his action.<ref name=\"navy-ship-nimitz\" />\n\nAfter commanding the Atlantic Submarine Flotilla from May 1912 to March 1913, he supervised the building of [[diesel engine]]s for the fleet [[Tanker (ship)|oil tanker]] {{USS|Maumee|AO-2|2}}, under construction at the [[New London Ship and Engine Company]], [[Groton, Connecticut]].<ref>Potter, p. 124.</ref>\n\n===World War I===\nIn the summer of 1913, Nimitz (who spoke German) studied engines at the diesel engine plants in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, and [[Ghent]], Belgium. Returning to the [[New York Navy Yard]], he became [[Executive officer|executive]] and engineer officer of ''Maumee'' at her [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] on October 23, 1916.\n\nAfter the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, Nimitz was Chief Engineer of ''Maumee'' while the vessel served as a refueling ship for the first squadron of U.S. Navy destroyers to cross the Atlantic, to take part in the war. Under his supervision, ''Maumee'' conducted the first-ever [[underway replenishment|underway refuelings]]. On August 10, 1917, Nimitz became aide to Rear Admiral [[Samuel S. Robison]], Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (<small>[[ComSubLant|COMSUBLANT]]</small>).\n\nOn February 6, 1918, Nimitz was appointed chief of staff and was awarded a [[Navy Commendation Medal|Letter of Commendation]] for meritorious service as <small>COMSUBLANT</small>'s chief of staff. On September 16, he reported to the office of the Chief of Naval Operations, and on October 25 was given additional duty as Senior Member, Board of Submarine Design.\n\n===Between the wars===\nFrom May 1919 to June 1920, Nimitz served as executive officer of the battleship {{USS|South Carolina|BB-26|2}}. He then commanded the cruiser {{USS|Chicago|CA-14|2}} with additional duty in command of Submarine Division 14, based at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii. Returning to the mainland in the summer of 1922, he studied at the [[Naval War College]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]].\n\nIn June 1923, he became aide and assistant chief of staff to the Commander, [[Battle Fleet]], and later to the Commander In Chief, [[United States Fleet]]. In August 1926, he went to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], to establish the Navy's first [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps]] unit.\n\nNimitz lost part of one finger in an accident with a diesel engine, saving the rest of it only when the machine jammed against his [[United States Naval Academy|Annapolis]] ring.<ref>Potter, p. 126.</ref>\n\nIn June 1929, he took command of Submarine Division 20. In June 1931, he assumed command of the [[destroyer tender]] {{USS|Rigel|AD-13|2}} and the destroyers out of commission at [[San Diego, California]]. In October 1933, he took command of the cruiser {{USS|Augusta|CA-31|2}} and deployed to the [[Far East]], where in December, ''Augusta'' became the [[flagship]] of the [[Asiatic Fleet]].\n\nIn April 1935, Nimitz returned home for three years as assistant chief of the Bureau of Navigation, before becoming commander, Cruiser Division 2, Battle Force. In September 1938 he took command of Battleship Division 1, Battle Force. On June 15, 1939, he was appointed chief of the Bureau of Navigation. During this time, Nimitz conducted experiments in the underway refueling of large ships which would prove a key element in the Navy's success in the war to come.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1941, Nimitz served as President of the Army Navy Country Club, in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n===World War II===\n{{See also|United States Navy in World War II|Naval history of World War II}}\n[[File:nimitz and miller.jpg|thumb|250px|Admiral Chester W.

Roosevelt]] to be commander-in-chief, [[United States Pacific Fleet]] (CINCPACFLT). He was promoted to the rank of [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]], effective December 31, 1941. Nimitz immediately departed Washington for Hawaii and took command in a ceremony on the top deck of the submarine {{USS|Grayling|SS-209|2}}. The change of command ceremony would normally have taken place aboard a battleship, but every battleship in Pearl Harbor had been either sunk or damaged during the attack. Assuming command at the most critical period of the war in the Pacific, Admiral Nimitz organized his forces to halt the Japanese advance, despite the shortage of ships, planes, and supplies.<ref>Edwin Hoyt, ''How they won the war in the Pacific: Nimitz and his admirals'' (Rowman & Littlefield, 2011).</ref>  He had a significant advantage in that the United States had cracked the Japanese diplomatic naval code and had made progress on the [[Japanese naval codes#JN-25|naval code JN-25]]. The Japanese had kept radio silence before the attack on Pearl Harbor, but now events were moving so rapidly that they had to rely on coded radio messages that they did not realize were being read in Hawaii.<ref>John Winton, ''Ultra in the Pacific: how breaking Japanese codes & cyphers affected naval operations against Japan 1941-45'' (1993).</ref>\n\nOn March 24, 1942, the newly formed US-British [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] issued a directive designating the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] an area of American strategic responsibility. Six days later, the US [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (JCS) divided the theater into three areas: the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]], the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]] (commanded by General [[Douglas MacArthur]]), and the [[Southeast Pacific Area]]. The JCS designated Nimitz as \"Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas\", with operational control over all [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] units (air, land, and sea) in that area.<ref>{{cite book|title=United States Navy Office of the Chief of Naval Operations: 100th Anniversary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayExVoPZEvMC&pg=PP25|year=2015|publisher=Government Printing Office|pages=25\u201330|isbn = 9780160927799}}</ref>\n \nNimitz, in Hawaii, and his superior Admiral [[Ernest King]], the Chief of Naval Operations, in Washington, rejected the plan of General Douglas MacArthur to advance on Japan through New Guinea and the Philippines and Formosa. Instead they proposed an island-hopping plan that would allow them to bypass most of the Japanese strength in the Central Pacific until they reached Okinawa. President Roosevelt compromised, giving both MacArthur and Nimitz their own theaters. The two Pacific theaters were favored, to the dismay of generals George Marshall and Dwight Eisenhower, who favored a Germany-first strategy. King and Nimitz provided MacArthur with some naval forces, but kept most of the carriers. However, when the time came to plan an invasion of Japan, MacArthur was given overall command.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas B. Buell|title=Master of Seapower: A Biography of Fleet Admiral Ernest J.

The Battle of the Coral Sea, while a loss in terms of total damage suffered, resulted in the strategic success of turning back a Japanese invasion of [[Port Moresby]] on the island of New Guinea. Two Japanese carriers were temporarily taken out of action in the battle, which would deprive the Japanese of their use in the Midway operation that shortly followed. The Navy's intelligence team figured that the Japanese would be attacking Midway, so Nimitz moved all his available forces to the defense. The severe losses in Japanese carriers at Midway affected the balance of naval air power during the remainder of 1942, and was crucial in neutralizing Japanese offensive threats in the South Pacific. Naval engagements during the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] left both forces severely depleted. However, with the allied advantage in land-based air power, the results were sufficient to secure Guadalcanal. The US and allied forces then undertook to neutralize remaining Japanese offensive threats with the [[Solomon Islands campaign]] and the [[New Guinea Campaign]], while building capabilities for major fleet actions. In 1943, Midway became a forward submarine base, greatly enhancing US capabilities against Japanese shipping.<ref>Gordon W. Prange, Donald M. Goldstein, and Katherine V. Dillon, ''Miracle at Midway'' (1982).</ref>\n\nIn terms of combat, 1943 was a relatively quiet year, but it proved decisive inasmuch as Nimitz gained the materiel and manpower needed to launch major fleet offensives to destroy Japanese power in the central Pacific region. This drive opened with the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]] from November 1943 to February 1944, followed by the destruction of the strategic Japanese base at [[Operation Hailstone|Truk Lagoon]], and the Marianas campaign that brought the Japanese homeland within range of new strategic bombers.  Nimitz's forces inflicted a decisive defeat on the Japanese fleet in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] (June 19\u201320, 1944), which allowed the capture of [[Saipan]], [[Guam]], and [[Tinian]].<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison,  '' The Two-Ocean War; A Short History of the United States Navy in the Second World War'' (1963) pp 222-291.</ref>  His Fleet Forces isolated enemy-held bastions on the central and eastern [[Caroline Islands]] and secured in quick succession [[Peleliu]], [[Angaur]], and [[Ulithi]]. In the Philippines, his ships destroyed much of the remaining Japanese naval power at the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], October 24 to 26, 1944. With the loss of the Philippines, Japan's energy supply routes from Indonesia came under direct threat, crippling their war effort.<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''Leyte, June 1944-January 1945'' (1958)</ref>\n\nBy Act of Congress, passed on December 14, 1944, the rank of [[Fleet admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]] \u2014 the highest rank in the Navy \u2014 was established. The next day President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Nimitz to that rank.

Nimitz's wife remained in the continental United States for the duration of the war, and did not join her husband in Hawaii or Guam.   In 1945, Nimitz's forces launched successful amphibious assaults on [[Iwo Jima]] and [[Okinawa]] and his carriers raided the home waters of Japan. In addition, Nimitz also ordered the Army Air Corps to mine the Japanese ports and waterways by air with [[B-29 Superfortress]]es in a successful mission called [[Operation Starvation]], which severely interrupted the Japanese logistics.<ref>Megan  Tzeng,  \"The Battle of Okinawa, 1945: Final turning point in the Pacific.\" ''History Teacher'' (2000): 95-117.

On October 5, 1945, which had been officially designated as \"Nimitz Day\" in [[Washington, D.C.]], Nimitz was personally presented a second [[5/16 inch star|Gold Star]] for the third award of the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] by President [[Harry S.

King]]. He had assured the President that he was willing to serve as the CNO for one two-year term, but no longer. He tackled the difficult task of reducing the most powerful navy in the world to a fraction of its war-time strength, while establishing and overseeing active and reserve fleets with the strength and readiness required to support national policy.\n\nFor the postwar trial of German Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] in 1946, Nimitz furnished an affidavit in support of the practice of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], a practice that he himself had employed throughout the war in the Pacific.

However, since the rank of fleet admiral is a lifetime appointment, he remained on active duty for the rest of his life, with full pay and benefits. He and his wife, Catherine, moved to [[Berkeley, California]]. After he suffered a serious fall in 1964, he and Catherine moved to US Naval quarters on [[Yerba Buena Island]] in the [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nIn San Francisco, Nimitz served in the mostly ceremonial post as a special assistant to the Secretary of the Navy in the Western Sea Frontier. He worked to help restore goodwill with Japan after World War II by helping to raise funds for the restoration of the Japanese Imperial Navy battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}}, Admiral [[Heihachiro Togo]]'s flagship at the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905.\n\nNimitz was also appointed as the [[United Nations]] Plebiscite Administrator for [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]] on 31 December 1948. The terms of the plebiscite were that Pakistan would vacate regions of Kashmir under its control, and that India would remove additional military from Kashmir. But due to disagreements between the two nations regarding demilitarisation, the plebiscite is still pending.<ref>{{citation |last=Korbel |first=Josef |authorlink=Josef Korbel |title=Danger in Kashmir |publisher=Princeton University Press |edition=second |year=1966 |origyear=first published 1954 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Q7WCgAAQBAJ |pp=155\u2013156|isbn=9781400875238 }}</ref>\n\nNimitz became a member of the [[Bohemian Club]] of San Francisco.

[[Submarine Warfare insignia|Qualified in submarines]] during his early years, he later oversaw the conversion of these vessels' propulsion from gasoline to diesel, and then later was key in acquiring approval to build the world's first [[Nuclear propulsion|nuclear-powered]] submarine, {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, whose propulsion system later completely superseded [[Diesel engine|diesel-powered]] submarines in the US. He also, beginning in 1917, was the Navy's leading developer of [[underway replenishment]] techniques, the tool which during the Pacific war would allow the US fleet to operate away from port almost indefinitely. The chief of the Navy's [[Bureau of Navigation (United States Navy)|Bureau of Navigation]] in 1939, Nimitz served as [[Chief of Naval Operations]] from 1945 until 1947. He was the United States' last surviving officer who served in the rank of fleet admiral.\n\n==Early life and education==\nNimitz, a [[German Texan]], was born the son of Anna Josephine (Henke) and Chester Bernhard Nimitz on February 24, 1885, in [[Fredericksburg, Texas]],<ref>Potter, p. 26.</ref> where his grandfather's hotel is now the [[Admiral Nimitz State Historic Site]].

His congressman, [[James L. Slayden]], told him that he had one appointment available for the [[United States Naval Academy]] and that he would award it to the best qualified candidate. Nimitz felt that this was his only opportunity for further education and spent extra time studying to earn the appointment. He was appointed to the Naval Academy from [[Texas's 12th congressional district]] in 1901, and he graduated with distinction on January 30, 1905, seventh in a class of 114.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Fleet Admiral Chester W.

In September 1906, he was transferred to the cruiser {{USS|Baltimore|C-3|2}}; on January 31, 1907, after the two years at sea as a [[warrant officer]] then required by law, he was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]. Remaining on Asiatic Station in 1907, he successively served on the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Panay|1899|2}}, [[destroyer]] {{USS|Decatur|DD-5|2}}, and cruiser {{USS|Denver|CL-16|2}}.\n\nThe destroyer ''Decatur'' [[Ship grounding|ran aground]] on a mud bank in the Philippines on July 7, 1908 while under the command of Ensign Nimitz.

In May of that year, he was given command of the flotilla, with additional duty in command of {{USS|Plunger|SS-2|6}}, later renamed ''A-1''.   He was promoted directly from ensign to lieutenant in January 1910.  He commanded {{USS|Snapper|SS-16|6}} (later renamed ''C-5'') when that submarine was commissioned on February 2, 1910, and on November 18, 1910 assumed command of {{USS|Narwhal|SS-17|6}} (later renamed ''D-1'').<ref name=\"navy-ship-nimitz\" />\n\nIn the latter command, he had additional duty from October 10, 1911 as Commander 3rd Submarine Division Atlantic Torpedo Fleet. In November 1911, he was ordered to the [[Boston Navy Yard]], to assist in fitting out {{USS|Skipjack|SS-24|6}} and assumed command of that submarine, which had been renamed ''E-1'', at her commissioning on February 14, 1912. On the [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]] [[USS Nevada (BM-8)|''Tonopah'']] (then employed as a submarine tender) on March 20, 1912, he rescued Fireman Second Class W. J. Walsh from drowning, receiving a [[Silver Lifesaving Medal]] for his action.<ref name=\"navy-ship-nimitz\" />\n\nAfter commanding the Atlantic Submarine Flotilla from May 1912 to March 1913, he supervised the building of [[diesel engine]]s for the fleet [[Tanker (ship)|oil tanker]] {{USS|Maumee|AO-2|2}}, under construction at the [[New London Ship and Engine Company]], [[Groton, Connecticut]].<ref>Potter, p. 124.</ref>\n\n===World War I===\nIn the summer of 1913, Nimitz (who spoke German) studied engines at the diesel engine plants in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, and [[Ghent]], Belgium. Returning to the [[New York Navy Yard]], he became [[Executive officer|executive]] and engineer officer of ''Maumee'' at her [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] on October 23, 1916.\n\nAfter the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, Nimitz was Chief Engineer of ''Maumee'' while the vessel served as a refueling ship for the first squadron of U.S. Navy destroyers to cross the Atlantic, to take part in the war. Under his supervision, ''Maumee'' conducted the first-ever [[underway replenishment|underway refuelings]]. On August 10, 1917, Nimitz became aide to Rear Admiral [[Samuel S. Robison]], Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (<small>[[ComSubLant|COMSUBLANT]]</small>).\n\nOn February 6, 1918, Nimitz was appointed chief of staff and was awarded a [[Navy Commendation Medal|Letter of Commendation]] for meritorious service as <small>COMSUBLANT</small>'s chief of staff. On September 16, he reported to the office of the Chief of Naval Operations, and on October 25 was given additional duty as Senior Member, Board of Submarine Design.\n\n===Between the wars===\nFrom May 1919 to June 1920, Nimitz served as executive officer of the battleship {{USS|South Carolina|BB-26|2}}. He then commanded the cruiser {{USS|Chicago|CA-14|2}} with additional duty in command of Submarine Division 14, based at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii. Returning to the mainland in the summer of 1922, he studied at the [[Naval War College]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]].\n\nIn June 1923, he became aide and assistant chief of staff to the Commander, [[Battle Fleet]], and later to the Commander In Chief, [[United States Fleet]]. In August 1926, he went to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], to establish the Navy's first [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps]] unit.\n\nNimitz lost part of one finger in an accident with a diesel engine, saving the rest of it only when the machine jammed against his [[United States Naval Academy|Annapolis]] ring.<ref>Potter, p. 126.</ref>\n\nIn June 1929, he took command of Submarine Division 20. In June 1931, he assumed command of the [[destroyer tender]] {{USS|Rigel|AD-13|2}} and the destroyers out of commission at [[San Diego, California]]. In October 1933, he took command of the cruiser {{USS|Augusta|CA-31|2}} and deployed to the [[Far East]], where in December, ''Augusta'' became the [[flagship]] of the [[Asiatic Fleet]].\n\nIn April 1935, Nimitz returned home for three years as assistant chief of the Bureau of Navigation, before becoming commander, Cruiser Division 2, Battle Force. In September 1938 he took command of Battleship Division 1, Battle Force. On June 15, 1939, he was appointed chief of the Bureau of Navigation. During this time, Nimitz conducted experiments in the underway refueling of large ships which would prove a key element in the Navy's success in the war to come.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1941, Nimitz served as President of the Army Navy Country Club, in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n===World War II===\n{{See also|United States Navy in World War II|Naval history of World War II}}\n[[File:nimitz and miller.jpg|thumb|250px|Admiral Chester W.

Roosevelt]] to be commander-in-chief, [[United States Pacific Fleet]] (CINCPACFLT). He was promoted to the rank of [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]], effective December 31, 1941. Nimitz immediately departed Washington for Hawaii and took command in a ceremony on the top deck of the submarine {{USS|Grayling|SS-209|2}}. The change of command ceremony would normally have taken place aboard a battleship, but every battleship in Pearl Harbor had been either sunk or damaged during the attack. Assuming command at the most critical period of the war in the Pacific, Admiral Nimitz organized his forces to halt the Japanese advance, despite the shortage of ships, planes, and supplies.<ref>Edwin Hoyt, ''How they won the war in the Pacific: Nimitz and his admirals'' (Rowman & Littlefield, 2011).</ref>  He had a significant advantage in that the United States had cracked the Japanese diplomatic naval code and had made progress on the [[Japanese naval codes#JN-25|naval code JN-25]]. The Japanese had kept radio silence before the attack on Pearl Harbor, but now events were moving so rapidly that they had to rely on coded radio messages that they did not realize were being read in Hawaii.<ref>John Winton, ''Ultra in the Pacific: how breaking Japanese codes & cyphers affected naval operations against Japan 1941-45'' (1993).</ref>\n\nOn March 24, 1942, the newly formed US-British [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] issued a directive designating the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] an area of American strategic responsibility. Six days later, the US [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (JCS) divided the theater into three areas: the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]], the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]] (commanded by General [[Douglas MacArthur]]), and the [[Southeast Pacific Area]]. The JCS designated Nimitz as \"Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas\", with operational control over all [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] units (air, land, and sea) in that area.<ref>{{cite book|title=United States Navy Office of the Chief of Naval Operations: 100th Anniversary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayExVoPZEvMC&pg=PP25|year=2015|publisher=Government Printing Office|pages=25\u201330|isbn = 9780160927799}}</ref>\n \nNimitz, in Hawaii, and his superior Admiral [[Ernest King]], the Chief of Naval Operations, in Washington, rejected the plan of General Douglas MacArthur to advance on Japan through New Guinea and the Philippines and Formosa. Instead they proposed an island-hopping plan that would allow them to bypass most of the Japanese strength in the Central Pacific until they reached Okinawa. President Roosevelt compromised, giving both MacArthur and Nimitz their own theaters. The two Pacific theaters were favored, to the dismay of generals George Marshall and Dwight Eisenhower, who favored a Germany-first strategy. King and Nimitz provided MacArthur with some naval forces, but kept most of the carriers. However, when the time came to plan an invasion of Japan, MacArthur was given overall command.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas B. Buell|title=Master of Seapower: A Biography of Fleet Admiral Ernest J.

The Battle of the Coral Sea, while a loss in terms of total damage suffered, resulted in the strategic success of turning back a Japanese invasion of [[Port Moresby]] on the island of New Guinea. Two Japanese carriers were temporarily taken out of action in the battle, which would deprive the Japanese of their use in the Midway operation that shortly followed. The Navy's intelligence team figured that the Japanese would be attacking Midway, so Nimitz moved all his available forces to the defense. The severe losses in Japanese carriers at Midway affected the balance of naval air power during the remainder of 1942, and was crucial in neutralizing Japanese offensive threats in the South Pacific. Naval engagements during the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] left both forces severely depleted. However, with the allied advantage in land-based air power, the results were sufficient to secure Guadalcanal. The US and allied forces then undertook to neutralize remaining Japanese offensive threats with the [[Solomon Islands campaign]] and the [[New Guinea Campaign]], while building capabilities for major fleet actions. In 1943, Midway became a forward submarine base, greatly enhancing US capabilities against Japanese shipping.<ref>Gordon W. Prange, Donald M. Goldstein, and Katherine V. Dillon, ''Miracle at Midway'' (1982).</ref>\n\nIn terms of combat, 1943 was a relatively quiet year, but it proved decisive inasmuch as Nimitz gained the materiel and manpower needed to launch major fleet offensives to destroy Japanese power in the central Pacific region. This drive opened with the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]] from November 1943 to February 1944, followed by the destruction of the strategic Japanese base at [[Operation Hailstone|Truk Lagoon]], and the Marianas campaign that brought the Japanese homeland within range of new strategic bombers.  Nimitz's forces inflicted a decisive defeat on the Japanese fleet in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] (June 19\u201320, 1944), which allowed the capture of [[Saipan]], [[Guam]], and [[Tinian]].<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison,  '' The Two-Ocean War; A Short History of the United States Navy in the Second World War'' (1963) pp 222-291.</ref>  His Fleet Forces isolated enemy-held bastions on the central and eastern [[Caroline Islands]] and secured in quick succession [[Peleliu]], [[Angaur]], and [[Ulithi]]. In the Philippines, his ships destroyed much of the remaining Japanese naval power at the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], October 24 to 26, 1944. With the loss of the Philippines, Japan's energy supply routes from Indonesia came under direct threat, crippling their war effort.<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''Leyte, June 1944-January 1945'' (1958)</ref>\n\nBy Act of Congress, passed on December 14, 1944, the rank of [[Fleet admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]] \u2014 the highest rank in the Navy \u2014 was established. The next day President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Nimitz to that rank.

Nimitz's wife remained in the continental United States for the duration of the war, and did not join her husband in Hawaii or Guam.   In 1945, Nimitz's forces launched successful amphibious assaults on [[Iwo Jima]] and [[Okinawa]] and his carriers raided the home waters of Japan. In addition, Nimitz also ordered the Army Air Corps to mine the Japanese ports and waterways by air with [[B-29 Superfortress]]es in a successful mission called [[Operation Starvation]], which severely interrupted the Japanese logistics.<ref>Megan  Tzeng,  \"The Battle of Okinawa, 1945: Final turning point in the Pacific.\" ''History Teacher'' (2000): 95-117.

On October 5, 1945, which had been officially designated as \"Nimitz Day\" in [[Washington, D.C.]], Nimitz was personally presented a second [[5/16 inch star|Gold Star]] for the third award of the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] by President [[Harry S.

He tackled the difficult task of reducing the most powerful navy in the world to a fraction of its war-time strength, while establishing and overseeing active and reserve fleets with the strength and readiness required to support national policy.\n\nFor the postwar trial of German Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] in 1946, Nimitz furnished an affidavit in support of the practice of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], a practice that he himself had employed throughout the war in the Pacific.

However, since the rank of fleet admiral is a lifetime appointment, he remained on active duty for the rest of his life, with full pay and benefits. He and his wife, Catherine, moved to [[Berkeley, California]]. After he suffered a serious fall in 1964, he and Catherine moved to US Naval quarters on [[Yerba Buena Island]] in the [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nIn San Francisco, Nimitz served in the mostly ceremonial post as a special assistant to the Secretary of the Navy in the Western Sea Frontier. He worked to help restore goodwill with Japan after World War II by helping to raise funds for the restoration of the Japanese Imperial Navy battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}}, Admiral [[Heihachiro Togo]]'s flagship at the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905.\n\nNimitz was also appointed as the [[United Nations]] Plebiscite Administrator for [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]] on 31 December 1948. The terms of the plebiscite were that Pakistan would vacate regions of Kashmir under its control, and that India would remove additional military from Kashmir. But due to disagreements between the two nations regarding demilitarisation, the plebiscite is still pending.<ref>{{citation |last=Korbel |first=Josef |authorlink=Josef Korbel |title=Danger in Kashmir |publisher=Princeton University Press |edition=second |year=1966 |origyear=first published 1954 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Q7WCgAAQBAJ |pp=155\u2013156|isbn=9781400875238 }}</ref>\n\nNimitz became a member of the [[Bohemian Club]] of San Francisco.
