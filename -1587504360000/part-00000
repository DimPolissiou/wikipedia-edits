Tomb of [[Nakht]], [[18th dynasty]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], [[Ancient Egypt]]]]\n\n'''Human interactions with fungi''' include both beneficial uses, whether practical or symbolic, and harmful interactions such as when fungi damage crops, timber, or food.\n\n[[Yeasts]] have been used since ancient times to leaven bread and to [[fermentation|ferment]] [[beer]] and [[wine]]. More recently, [[Mold (fungus)|mould]] fungi have been exploited to create a wide range of industrial products, including [[enzyme]]s and [[drug]]s. [[Drug|Medicines]] based on fungi include [[antibiotic]]s, [[immunosuppressant]]s, [[statin]]s and many [[anti-cancer drugs]]. The yeast species ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is an important [[model organism]] in [[cell biology]]. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible [[mushroom]]s, including delicacies like the [[chanterelle]], [[cep (mushroom)|cep]], and [[truffle]], while [[edible mushroom|a few species are cultivated]]. [[Mold (fungus)|Mould]] fungi provide the [[umami|meaty (umami)]] flavour of fermented [[soybean]] products such as [[tempeh]], [[miso]] and [[soy sauce]], and contribute flavour and colour to [[blue cheese]]s including [[Roquefort]] and [[Stilton]]. Moulds also yield [[vegetarian]] [[meat substitute]]s like [[Quorn]]. Some fungi, especially the [[fly agaric]] and [[psilocybin mushroom]]s are used for the [[psychoactive drug]]s that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of [[ethnomycology]]. Fungi have appeared, too, from time to time, in literature and art.\n\nFungi create harm by [[food spoilage|spoiling food]], [[wood-decay fungi|destroying timber]], and by causing [[plant pathology#Fungi|diseases of crops]], [[Pathogenic fungus|livestock, and humans]]. Fungi, mainly moulds like ''[[Penicillium]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus]]'', spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause the majority of plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the [[Great Irish Famine]] of 1845\u20131849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by ''[[Phytophthora]]'', result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly the main cause of economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; [[Aspergillosis]] kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened [[immune system]]s.\n\n==Context==\n\n[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].<ref name=MacionisGerber2011>{{cite book |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |oclc = 652430995}}</ref> This article describes the roles played by fungi in human culture.\n\n==Practical uses==\n===Fermentation===\n[[File:V\u00fdroba chleba (29).JPG|thumb|[[Bread]] dough leavened with yeast]]\n{{main|Fermentation|Yeast|Enzyme}}\n\n[[Yeast]]s have been used since ancient times to leaven [[bread]] and to [[fermentation|ferment]] [[beer]] and [[wine]].<ref name=Legras2007>{{cite journal |vauthors=Legras JL, Merdinoglu D, Cornuet JM, Karst F |title=Bread, beer and wine: ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' diversity reflects human history |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=16 |issue=10 |pages=2091\u20132102 |year=2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03266.x |pmid=17498234|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9db23f177fab12e8c553e973e2e5af0a9e9d7833 }}</ref> More recently, fungi have been used for a wide variety of [[industrial fermentation]]s, whether working directly for their effects on materials such as processing paper pulp or [[bioremediation|bioremediating]] industrial waste, or serving as the source of [[enzyme]]s for many purposes, such as fading and softening [[denim]] for [[fashion]]able [[blue jeans]].<ref name=\"Kew\"/> Fungi yield a wide variety of [[industrial enzymes]] including [[amylase]]s, [[invertase]]s, [[cellulase]]s and [[hemicellulase]]s, [[pectinase]]s, [[protease]]s, [[laccase]]s, [[phytase]]s, [[alpha-glucuronidase]]s, [[mannanase]]s, and [[lipase]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=De Lourdes|first1=Maria |last2=Polizeli |first2=T.

More recently, [[mould]] fungi have been exploited to create a wide range of industrial products, including [[enzyme]]s and [[drug]]s. [[Drug|Medicines]] based on fungi include [[antibiotic]]s, [[immunosuppressant]]s, [[statin]]s and many [[anti-cancer drugs]]. The yeast species ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is an important [[model organism]] in [[cell biology]]. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible [[mushroom]]s, including delicacies like the [[chanterelle]], [[cep (mushroom)|cep]], and [[truffle]], while [[edible mushroom|a few species are cultivated]]. [[Mould]] fungi provide the [[umami|meaty (umami)]] flavour of fermented [[soybean]] products such as [[tempeh]], [[miso]] and [[soy sauce]], and contribute flavour and colour to [[blue cheese]]s including [[Roquefort]] and [[Stilton]]. Moulds also yield [[vegetarian]] [[meat substitute]]s like [[Quorn]]. Some fungi, especially the [[fly agaric]] and [[psilocybin mushroom]]s are used for the [[psychoactive drug]]s that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of [[ethnomycology]]. Fungi have appeared, too, from time to time, in literature and art.\n\nFungi create harm by [[food spoilage|spoiling food]], [[wood-decay fungi|destroying timber]], and by causing [[plant pathology#Fungi|diseases of crops]], [[Pathogenic fungus|livestock, and humans]]. Fungi, mainly moulds like ''[[Penicillium]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus]]'', spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause the majority of plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the [[Great Irish Famine]] of 1845\u20131849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by ''[[Phytophthora]]'', result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly the main cause of economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; [[Aspergillosis]] kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened [[immune system]]s.\n\n==Context==\n\n[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]].

Her research into dental development made major contributions to the scientific understanding of the maturation of early hominids and the evolution of human life history. Her significant publications have focused on tooth emergence, weaning, wear, and their impact on life cycle. In 1991, she published \u201cDental Development and the Evolution of Life History in Hominidae,\u201d in which she suggested that the life history of australopiths was similar to that of apes, whereas the life histories of later hominids were more similar to modern humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=B.

The [[lipolysis]] reaction is greatly enhanced by the presence of an aqueous phase, so when oil is separated from [[water]] during processing, [[lipolysis]] slows down and stops.\n\n== Measurement of free acidity ==\nFree acidity is a defect of [[olive oil]] that is tasteless and odorless, thus can not be detected by [[sensory analysis]]. Since [[vegetable oils]] are not aqueous fluids, a [[pH-meter]] can not be used for this measure. Various approaches exist that can measure oil acidity with good [[accuracy]].\n\n=== Manual titration===\nThe official technique to measure free acidity in [[olive oil]] (as defined by the [[European Commission]] regulation No. 2568/91) is a manual [[titration]] procedure: a known volume of the oil to be tested is added to a mix of [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[methanol]] and [[phenolphthalein]], known volumes of [[potassium hydroxide]] KOH 0.1M (the titrant) are added until there is a change in the color of the solution. The total volume of added titrant is then used to estimate the free acidity. The official technique for acidity measure in [[olive oil]] is accurate and reliable, but is essentially a laboratory method that must be carried out by trained personnel (mainly because of the toxic compounds used). Hence it is not suitable for ''in situ'' measurements in small [[oil mill]]s.\n\n=== Near-infrared spectroscopy===\nOne of the most promising method is based on optical [[near-infrared spectroscopy]] (NIR) where the optical [[absorbance]], i.e. the fraction of intensity of the incident light that is absorbed by the oil sample, is used to estimate the oil acidity. An oil sample is placed in a [[cuvette]] and analyzed by a [[spectrophotometer]] on a wide range of [[wavelength]]s. The results (i.e. the absorbance data for every tested wavelength) are thus processed by a statistical algorithm, such as [[Principal Component Analysis]] (PCA) or [[partial least squares regression|Partial Least Squares regression]] (PLS), to estimate the oil acidity. The  feasibility to measure [[olive oil]] free acidity and [[peroxide value]] by NIR spectroscopy in the wavenumber range 4,541 to 11,726&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> was reported.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Armenta|first1=S.|last2=Garrigues|first2=S.|last3=De la Guardia|first3=M.|title=Determination of edible oil parameters by near infrared spectrometry|journal=Analytica Chimica Acta|date=2007|volume=596|issue=2|pages=330\u2013337|doi=10.1016/j.aca.2007.06.028|pmid=17631115}}</ref> Many commercial [[spectrophotometer]]s exist <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.claudiovignoli.com/nir-olive-analyzer-t-38-mini/|title=NIR Olive Analyzer T-38 Mini|website=www.claudiovignoli.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}</ref> that can be used for analysis of different quality parameters in olive oil.  The main advantage of NIR [[spectroscopy]] is the possibility to carry out the analysis on raw olive oil samples, without any chemical pretreatment. The main drawbacks are the high cost of commercial [[spectrophotometer]] and the need of [[calibration]] for different types of oil (produced by olives of different varieties, different geographical origin, etc.).\n\n=== Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy===\nAnother approach<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Grossi|first1=Marco|last2=Di Lecce|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Gallina Toschi|first3=Tullia|last4=Ricc\u00f2|first4=Bruno|title=A novel electrochemical method for olive oil acidity determination|journal=Microelectronics Journal|date=2014|volume=45|issue=12|pages=1701\u20131707|doi=10.1016/j.mejo.2014.07.006|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01276343/file/A%20Novel%20Electrochemical%20Method%20for%20Olive%20Oil%20Acidity%20Deter%E2%80%A6.pdf}}</ref> is based on [[Dielectric spectroscopy|electrochemical impedance spectroscopy]] (EIS).

The [[lipolysis]] reaction is greatly enhanced by the presence of an aqueous phase, so when oil is separated from [[water]] during processing, [[lipolysis]] slows down and stops.\n\n== Measurement of free acidity ==\nFree acidity is a defect of [[olive oil]] that is tasteless and odorless, thus can not be detected by [[sensory analysis]]. Since [[vegetable oils]] are not aqueous fluids, a [[pH-meter]] can not be used for this measure. Various approaches exist that can measure oil acidity with good [[accuracy]].\n\n=== Manual titration===\nThe official technique to measure free acidity in [[olive oil]] (as defined by the [[European Commission]] regulation No. 2568/91) is a manual [[titration]] procedure: a known volume of the oil to be tested is added to a mix of [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[methanol]] and [[phenolphthalein]], known volumes of [[potassium hydroxide]] KOH 0.1M (the titrant) are added until there is a change in the color of the solution. The total volume of added titrant is then used to estimate the free acidity. The official technique for acidity measure in [[olive oil]] is accurate and reliable, but is essentially a laboratory method that must be carried out by trained personnel (mainly because of the toxic compounds used). Hence it is not suitable for ''in situ'' measurements in small [[oil mill]]s.\n\n=== Near-infrared spectroscopy===\nOne of the most promising method is based on optical [[near-infrared spectroscopy]] (NIR) where the optical [[absorbance]], i.e. the fraction of intensity of the incident light that is absorbed by the oil sample, is used to estimate the oil acidity. An oil sample is placed in a [[cuvette]] and analyzed by a [[spectrophotometer]] on a wide range of [[wavelength]]s. The results (i.e. the absorbance data for every tested wavelength) are thus processed by a statistical algorithm, such as [[Principal Component Analysis]] (PCA) or [[partial least squares regression|Partial Least Squares regression]] (PLS), to estimate the oil acidity. The  feasibility to measure [[olive oil]] free acidity and [[peroxide value]] by NIR spectroscopy in the wavenumber range 4,541 to 11,726&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> was reported.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Armenta|first1=S.|last2=Garrigues|first2=S.|last3=De la Guardia|first3=M.|title=Determination of edible oil parameters by near infrared spectrometry|journal=Analytica Chimica Acta|date=2007|volume=596|issue=2|pages=330\u2013337|doi=10.1016/j.aca.2007.06.028|pmid=17631115}}</ref> Many commercial [[spectrophotometer]]s exist <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.claudiovignoli.com/nir-olive-analyzer-t-38-mini/|title=NIR Olive Analyzer T-38 Mini|website=www.claudiovignoli.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}</ref> that can be used for analysis of different quality parameters in olive oil.  The main advantage of NIR [[spectroscopy]] is the possibility to carry out the analysis on raw olive oil samples, without any chemical pretreatment. The main drawbacks are the high cost of commercial [[spectrophotometer]] and the need of [[calibration]] for different types of oil (produced by olives of different varieties, different geographical origin, etc.).\n\n=== Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy===\nAnother approach<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Grossi|first1=Marco|last2=Di Lecce|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Gallina Toschi|first3=Tullia|last4=Ricc\u00f2|first4=Bruno|title=A novel electrochemical method for olive oil acidity determination|journal=Microelectronics Journal|date=2014|volume=45|issue=12|pages=1701\u20131707|doi=10.1016/j.mejo.2014.07.006|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01276343/file/A%20Novel%20Electrochemical%20Method%20for%20Olive%20Oil%20Acidity%20Deter%E2%80%A6.pdf}}</ref> is based on [[Dielectric spectroscopy|electrochemical impedance spectroscopy]] (EIS).
