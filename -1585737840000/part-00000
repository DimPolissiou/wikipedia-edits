The problems occur due to differences in outcome between administrators. There have also been issues in regards to the lack of consistent patterns and methods for each diagnosis (Milberg & Hebben, 2013). This neuropsychological flexible battery approach allows for administrators to choose which tests they want to use, however, it makes room for the lack of consistency in choosing the tests for each type of neurological issue. Accordingly, there are questions about the empirical validity of the Boston Process Approach. With that being said, the Boston Process Approach revolutionized the field of clinical psychology and is still widely used today (Milberg & Hebben, 2013).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

As a [[sky deity]], she was the mother or consort of the sky god [[Horus]] and the [[sun god]] [[Ra]], both of whom were connected with kingship, and thus she was the symbolic mother of their earthly representatives, the [[pharaoh]]s. She was one of several goddesses who acted as the [[Eye of Ra]], Ra's feminine counterpart, and in this form she had a vengeful aspect that protected him from his enemies. Her beneficent side represented music, dance, joy, love, sexuality and maternal care, and she acted as the consort of several male deities and the mother of their sons. These two aspects of the goddess exemplified the [[women in ancient Egypt|Egyptian conception]] of [[femininity]]. Hathor crossed boundaries between worlds, helping deceased [[ancient Egyptian conception of the soul|souls]] in the transition to the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]].\n\nHathor was often depicted as a [[Cattle in religion|cow]], symbolizing her maternal and celestial aspect, although her most common form was a woman wearing a headdress of cow horns and a sun disk. She could also be represented as a lioness, cobra, or [[Ficus sycomorus|sycamore tree]].\n\nCattle goddesses similar to Hathor were portrayed in [[art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]] in the fourth millennium BC, but she may not have appeared until the [[Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686\u20132181 BC). With the patronage of Old Kingdom rulers she became one of Egypt's most important deities. More [[Egyptian temple|temples]] were dedicated to her than to any other goddess; her most prominent temple was [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. She was also worshipped in the temples of her male consorts. The Egyptians connected her with foreign lands such as [[Nubia]] and [[Canaan]] and their valuable goods, such as [[incense]] and [[semiprecious]] stones, and some of the peoples in those lands adopted her worship. In Egypt, she was one of the deities commonly invoked in private prayers and [[votive offerings]], particularly by women desiring children.\n\nDuring the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC), goddesses such as [[Mut]] and [[Isis]] encroached on Hathor's position in royal ideology, but she remained one of the most widely worshipped deities. After the end of the New Kingdom, Hathor was increasingly overshadowed by Isis, but she continued to be venerated until the [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|extinction of ancient Egyptian religion]] in the early centuries AD.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Narmer Palette, Egypt, c. 3100 BC - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09726.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Stone slate carved with reliefs|Replica of the [[Narmer Palette]], c. 31st century BC. The face of a woman with the horns and ears of a cow, representing Hathor or [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], appears twice at the top of the palette and in a row below the belt of the king.]]\n[[File:Narmer palette 83d40m hathor atop columns below belt of king.png|thumb|right|Detail on the Narmar Palette below the belt of the king shows Hathor atop four columns]]\nImages of [[Ancient Egyptian cattle|cattle]] appear frequently in the [[art of ancient Egypt|artwork]] of [[Predynastic Egypt]] (before c. 3100 BC), as do images of women with upraised, curved arms reminiscent of the shape of bovine horns. Both types of imagery may represent [[ancient Egyptian deities|goddesses]] connected with [[Cattle in religion|cattle]].{{sfn|Hassan|1992|p=15}} Cows are [[cattle in religion and mythology|venerated in many cultures]], including ancient Egypt, as symbols of motherhood and nourishment, because they care for their calves and supply humans with milk. The [[list of ancient Egyptian palettes#Gerzeh Palette|Gerzeh Palette]], a [[cosmetic palette|stone palette]] from the [[Naqada II]] period of prehistory (c. 3500\u20133200 BC), shows the silhouette of a cow's head with inward-curving horns surrounded by stars. The palette suggests that this cow was also linked with the sky, as were several goddesses from later times who were represented in this form: Hathor, [[Mehet-Weret]], and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]].{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=15\u201317}}\n\nDespite these early precedents, Hathor is not unambiguously mentioned or depicted until the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (c. 2613\u20132494 BC) of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]],{{sfn|Wilkinson|1999|pp=244\u2013245}} although several artifacts that refer to her may date to the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] (c. 3100\u20132686 BC).{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=214}} When Hathor does clearly appear, her horns curve outward, rather than inward like those in Predynastic art.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=11\u201313}}\n\nA bovine deity with inward-curving horns appears on the [[Narmer Palette]] from near the start of Egyptian history, both atop the palette and on the belt or apron of the king, [[Narmer]]. The Egyptologist Henry George Fischer suggested this deity may be [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], a goddess who was later depicted with a woman's face and inward-curling horns, seemingly reflecting the curve of the cow horns.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=11\u201313}} The Egyptologist Lana Troy, however, identifies a passage in the ''[[Pyramid Texts]]'' from the late Old Kingdom that connects Hathor with the \"apron\" of the king, reminiscent of the goddess on Narmer's garments, and suggests the goddess on the Narmer Palette is Hathor rather than Bat,{{sfn|Wilkinson|1999|pp=244\u2013245}}{{sfn|Troy|1986|p=54}} and the motif resembles the head of Hathor atop the columns of temples built throughout many dynasties. \n\nIn the Fourth Dynasty, Hathor rose rapidly to prominence.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=81\u201383}} She supplanted an early crocodile god who was worshipped at [[Dendera]] in [[Upper Egypt]] to become Dendera's patron deity, and she increasingly absorbed the cult of Bat in the neighboring region of [[Hu, Egypt|Hu]], so that in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055\u20131650 BC) the two deities fused into one.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=7, 14\u201315}} The theology surrounding the [[pharaoh]] in the Old Kingdom, unlike that of earlier times, focused heavily on the sun god [[Ra]] as [[king of the gods]] and father and patron of the earthly king. Hathor ascended with Ra and became his mythological wife, and thus divine mother of the pharaoh.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=81\u201383}}\n\n==Roles==\nHathor took many forms and appeared in a wide variety of roles.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 145}} The Egyptologist Robyn Gillam suggests that these diverse forms emerged when the royal goddess promoted by the Old Kingdom court subsumed many local goddesses worshipped by the general populace, who were then treated as manifestations of her.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=217\u2013218}} Egyptian texts often speak of the manifestations of the goddess as \"Seven Hathors\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 145}} or, less commonly, of many more Hathors\u2014as many as 362.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=71\u201372}} For these reasons, Gillam calls her \"a type of deity rather than a single entity\".{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=217\u2013218}} Hathor's diversity reflects the diversity of traits that the Egyptians associated with goddesses. More than any other deity, she exemplifies the [[women in ancient Egypt|Egyptian perception]] of [[femininity]].{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n===Sky goddess===\nHathor was given the [[epithet]]s \"mistress of the sky\" and \"mistress of the stars\", and was said to dwell in the sky with Ra and other sun deities. Egyptians thought of the sky as a body of water through which the sun god sailed, and they connected it with the waters from which, according to their [[ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation myths]], the sun emerged at the beginning of time. This cosmic mother goddess was often represented as a cow. Hathor and Mehet-Weret were both thought of as the cow who birthed the sun god and placed him between her horns. Like Nut, Hathor was said to give birth to the sun god each dawn.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=31\u201334, 46\u201347}}\n\nHathor's [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name was ''\u1e25wt-\u1e25rw''{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=130}} or ''\u1e25wt-\u1e25r''.{{sfn|Billing|2004|p=39}} It is typically translated \"house of Horus\" but can also be rendered as \"my house is the sky\".{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=25, 48}} The falcon god [[Horus]] represented, among other things, the sun and sky. The \"house\" referred to may be the sky in which Horus lives, or the goddess's womb from which he, as a sun god, is born each day.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}}\n\n===Solar goddess===\n{{further|Eye of Ra}}\nHathor was a solar deity, a feminine counterpart to sun gods such as Horus and Ra, and was a member of the divine entourage that accompanied Ra as he sailed through the sky in his [[barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|barque]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}} She was commonly called the \"Golden One\", referring to the radiance of the sun, and texts from [[Dendera Temple complex|her temple at Dendera]] say \"her rays illuminate the whole earth.\"{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=128, 184\u2013185}} She was sometimes fused with another goddess, [[Nebethetepet]], whose name can mean \"Lady of the Offering\", \"Lady of Contentment\",{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=156}} or \"Lady of the Vulva\".{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=155}} At Ra's cult center of [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], Hathor-Nebethetepet was worshipped as his consort,{{sfn|Quirke|2001|pp=102\u2013105}} and the Egyptologist Rudolf Anthes argued that Hathor's name referred to a mythical \"house of Horus\" at Heliopolis that was connected with the ideology of kingship.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=218}}\n\nShe was one of many goddesses to take the role of the Eye of Ra, a feminine personification of the disk of the sun and an extension of Ra's own power. Ra was sometimes portrayed inside the disk, which Troy interprets as meaning that the Eye goddess was thought of as a womb from which the sun god was born. Hathor's seemingly contradictory roles as mother, wife, and daughter of Ra reflected the daily cycle of the sun. At sunset the god entered the body of the goddess, impregnating her and fathering the deities born from her womb at sunrise: himself and the Eye goddess, who would later give birth to him. Ra gave rise to his daughter, the Eye goddess, who in turn gave rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=21\u201323, 25\u201327}}\n\nThe Eye of Ra protected the sun god from his enemies and was often represented as a [[uraeus]], or rearing [[cobra]], or as a lioness.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=129\u2013130}} A form of the Eye of Ra known as \"Hathor of the Four Faces\", represented by a set of four cobras, was said to face in each of the [[cardinal directions]] to watch for threats to the sun god.{{sfn|Ritner|1990|p=39}} A group of myths, known from the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC) onward, describe what happens when the Eye goddess rampages uncontrolled. In the [[ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary text]] known as the ''[[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]'', Ra sends Hathor as the Eye of Ra to punish humans for plotting rebellion against his rule. She becomes the lioness goddess [[Sekhmet]] and massacres the rebellious humans, but Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state reverts to being the benign and beautiful Hathor.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=169\u2013170}} Related to this story is the myth of the Distant Goddess, from the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] periods. The Eye goddess, sometimes in the form of Hathor, rebels against Ra's control and rampages freely in a foreign land: [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] west of Egypt or [[Nubia]] to the south. Weakened by the loss of his Eye, Ra sends another god, such as [[Thoth]], to bring her back to him.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=71\u201374}} Once pacified, the goddess returns to become the consort of the sun god or of the god who brings her back.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=130}} The two aspects of the Eye goddess\u2014violent and dangerous versus beautiful and joyful\u2014reflected the Egyptian belief that women, as the Egyptologist Carolyn Graves-Brown puts it, \"encompassed both extreme passions of fury and love.\"{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\n===Music, dance, and joy===\n[[File:Funerary banquet of Nebamun.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|alt=Painting of elaborately dressed men and women. Some women clap and play flutes while others dance.|Banquet scene from the tomb chapel of [[Nebamun]], 14th century BC. Its imagery of music and dancing alludes to Hathor.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013134}}]]\nEgyptian religion celebrated the sensory pleasures of life, believed to be among the gods' gifts to humanity. Egyptians ate, drank, danced, and played music at their religious festivals. They perfumed the air with flowers and [[incense]]. Many of Hathor's epithets link her to celebration; she is called the mistress of music, dance, garlands, [[myrrh]], and drunkenness. In hymns and temple reliefs, musicians play tambourines, harps, lyres, and sistra in Hathor's honor.{{sfn|Finnestad|1999|pp=113\u2013115}} The [[sistrum]], a rattle-like instrument, was particularly important in Hathor's worship. Sistra had erotic connotations and, by extension, alluded to the creation of new life.{{sfn|Manniche|2010|pp=13\u201314, 16\u201317}}\n\nThese aspects of Hathor were linked with the myth of the Eye of Ra. The Eye was pacified by beer in the story of the Destruction of Mankind. In some versions of the Distant Goddess myth, the wandering Eye's wildness abated when she was appeased with products of civilization like music, dance, and wine. The water of the annual [[inundation of the Nile]], colored red by sediment, was likened to wine, and to the red-dyed beer in the Destruction of Mankind. Festivals during the inundation therefore incorporated drink, music, and dance as a way to appease the returning goddess.{{sfn|Poo|2009|pp=153\u2013157}} A text from the [[Temple of Edfu]] says of Hathor, \"the gods play the sistrum for her, the goddesses dance for her to dispel her bad temper.\"{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=57}} A hymn to the goddess [[Raet-Tawy]] as a form of Hathor at the temple of [[Medamud]] describes the Festival of Drunkenness as part of her mythic return to Egypt.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|p=48}} Women carry bouquets of flowers, drunken revelers play drums, and people and animals from foreign lands dance for her as she enters the temple's festival booth. The noise of the celebration drives away hostile powers and ensures the goddess will remain in her joyful form as she awaits the male god of the temple, her mythological consort [[Montu]], whose son she will bear.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=54, 62, 91\u201394}}\n\n===Sexuality, beauty, and love===\nHathor's joyful, ecstatic side indicates her feminine, procreative power. In some creation myths she helped produce the world itself.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=138}} [[Atum]], a creator god who contained all things within himself, was said to have produced his children [[Shu (Egyptian god)|Shu]] and [[Tefnut]], and thus begun the process of creation, by masturbating. The hand he used for this act, the Hand of Atum, represented the female aspect of himself and could be personified by Hathor, Nebethetepet, or another goddess, [[Iusaaset]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=99, 141, 156}} In a late creation myth from the [[Ptolemaic Period]] (332\u201330 BC), the god [[Khonsu]] is put in a central role, and Hathor is the goddess with whom Khonsu mates to enable creation.{{sfn|Cruz-Uribe|1994|pp=185, 187\u2013188}}\n\nHathor could be the consort of many male gods, of whom Ra was only the most prominent. [[Mut]] was the usual consort of [[Amun]], the preeminent deity during the New Kingdom who was often linked with Ra. But Mut was rarely portrayed alongside Amun in contexts related to sex or fertility, and in those circumstances, Hathor or Isis stood at his side instead.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=155}} In the late periods of Egyptian history, the form of Hathor from Dendera and the form of Horus from Edfu were considered husband and wife{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=127}} and in different versions of the myth of the Distant Goddess, Hathor-Raettawy was the consort of Montu{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=47, 69}} and Hathor-Tefnut the consort of Shu.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=197}}\n\nHathor's sexual side was seen in some [[Ancient Egyptian literature#Narrative tales and stories|short stories]]. In a cryptic fragment of a Middle Kingdom story, known as \"The Tale of the Herdsman\", a herdsman encounters a hairy, animal-like goddess in a marsh and reacts with terror. On another day he encounters her as a nude, alluring woman. Most Egyptologists who study this story think this woman is Hathor or a goddess like her, one who can be wild and dangerous or benign and erotic. Thomas Schneider interprets the text as implying that between his two encounters with the goddess the herdsman has done something to pacify her.{{sfn|Schneider|2007|pp=315\u2013317}} In \"[[The Contendings of Horus and Set]]\", a New Kingdom short story about the [[Osiris myth#Conflict of Horus and Set|dispute between those two gods]], Ra is upset after being insulted by another god, [[Babi (mythology)|Babi]], and lies on his back alone. After some time, Hathor exposes her genitals to Ra, making him laugh and get up again to perform his duties as ruler of the gods. Life and order were thought to be dependent on Ra's activity, and the story implies that Hathor averted the disastrous consequences of his idleness. Her act may have lifted Ra's spirits partly because it sexually aroused him, although why he laughed is not fully understood.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=198\u2013199, 201, 207}}\n\nHathor was praised for her beautiful hair. Egyptian literature contains allusions to a myth not clearly described in any surviving texts, in which Hathor lost a lock of hair that represented her sexual allure. One text compares this loss with Horus's loss of his [[Eye of Horus|divine Eye]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]]'s loss of his testicles during the struggle between the two gods, implying that the loss of Hathor's lock was as catastrophic for her as the maiming of Horus and Set was for them.{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=346\u2013348}}\n\nHathor was called \"mistress of love\", as an extension of her sexual aspect. In the series of love poems from Papyrus Chester Beatty I, from the [[Twentieth Dynasty]] (c. 1189\u20131077 BC), men and women ask Hathor to bring their lovers to them: \"I prayed to her [Hathor] and she heard my prayer. She destined my mistress [loved one] for me. And she came of her own free will to see me.\"{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===Motherhood and queenship===\n[[File:Hatshepsut temple5.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Relief of a cow with a disk between her horns. A human wearing a crown drinks from her udders.|Hathor as a cow suckling [[Hatshepsut]], a female pharaoh, at Hatshepsut's [[temple of Hatshepsut|temple at Deir el-Bahari]], 15th century BC]]\nHathor was considered the mother of various child deities. As suggested by her name, she was often thought of as both Horus's mother and consort.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=82\u201383}} As both the king's wife and his heir's mother, Hathor was the mythic counterpart of human queens.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=130}}\n\nIsis and Osiris were considered Horus's parents in the [[Osiris myth]] as far back as the late Old Kingdom, but the relationship between Horus and Hathor may be older still. If so, Horus only came to be linked with Isis and Osiris as the Osiris myth emerged during the Old Kingdom.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=62}} Even after Isis was firmly established as Horus's mother, Hathor continued to appear in this role, especially when nursing the pharaoh. Images of the Hathor-cow with a child in a papyrus thicket represented her mythological upbringing in a secluded marsh. Goddesses' milk was a sign of divinity and royal status. Thus, images in which Hathor nurses the pharaoh represent his right to rule.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=175\u2013176}} Hathor's relationship with Horus gave a healing aspect to her character, as she was said to have restored Horus's missing eye or eyes after Set attacked him.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}} In the version of this episode in \"The Contendings of Horus and Set\", Hathor finds Horus with his eyes torn out and heals the wounds with gazelle's milk.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nBeginning in the [[Late Period of Egypt|Late Period]] (664\u2013323 BC), temples focused on the worship of a divine family: an adult male deity, his wife, and their immature son. Satellite buildings, known as [[mammisis]], were built in celebration of the birth of the local child deity. The child god represented the cyclical renewal of the cosmos and an archetypal heir to the kingship.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Hathor was the mother in many of these local triads of gods. At Dendera, the mature Horus of Edfu was the father and Hathor the mother, while their child was [[Ihy]], a god whose name meant \"sistrum-player\" and who personified the jubilation associated with the instrument.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=132\u2013133}} At [[Kom Ombo]], Hathor's local form, Tasenetnofret, was mother to Horus's son Panebtawy.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=123, 168}} Other children of Hathor included a minor deity from the town of Hu, named Neferhotep,{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=132\u2013133}} and several child forms of Horus.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=71}}\n\nThe milky sap of the [[ficus sycomorus|sycamore tree]], which the Egyptians regarded as a symbol of life, became one of her symbols.{{sfn|Roberts|2000|pp=26\u201327}} The milk was equated with water of the Nile inundation and thus fertility.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=179\u2013182}} In the late Ptolemaic and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Periods]], many temples contained a creation myth that adapted long-standing ideas about creation.{{sfn|McClain|2011|pp=3\u20136}} The version from Hathor's temple at Dendera emphasizes that she, as a female solar deity, was the first being to emerge from the primordial waters that preceded creation, and her life-giving light and milk nourished all living things.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=169\u2013172, 185}}\n\nLike [[Meskhenet]], another goddess who presided over birth, Hathor was connected with ''[[shai]]'', the Egyptian concept of [[fate]], particularly when she took the form of the Seven Hathors. In two New Kingdom works of fiction, \"[[The Tale of Two Brothers]]\" and \"[[The Tale of the Doomed Prince]]\", the Hathors appear at the births of major characters and foretell the manner of their deaths.{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2001|pp=507\u2013508}}\n\nHathor's maternal aspects can be compared with those of Isis and Mut, yet there are many contrasts between them. Isis's devotion to her husband and care for their child represented a more socially acceptable form of love than Hathor's uninhibited sexuality,{{sfn|Griffiths|2001|p=189}} and Mut's character was more authoritative than sexual.{{sfn|te Velde|2001|p=455}} The text of the first century AD [[Papyrus Insinger]] likens a faithful wife, the mistress of a household, to Mut, while comparing Hathor to a strange woman who tempts a married man.{{sfn|te Velde|2001|p=455}}\n\n===Foreign lands and goods===\nEgypt maintained trade relations with the coastal cities of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Canaan]], particularly [[Byblos]], placing Egyptian religion in contact with the [[ancient Canaanite religion|religions of that region]].{{sfn|Hollis|2009|p=2}} At some point, perhaps as early as the Old Kingdom, the Egyptians began to refer to the patron goddess of Byblos, [[Baalat Gebal]], as a local form of Hathor.{{sfn|Espinel|2002|pp=117\u2013119}} So strong was Hathor's link to Byblos that texts from Dendera say she resided there.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=139}} The Egyptians sometimes equated [[Anat]], an aggressive Canaanite goddess who came to be worshipped in Egypt during the New Kingdom, with Hathor.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=137}} Some Canaanite artworks depict a nude goddess with a curling wig taken from Hathor's iconography.{{sfn|Cornelius|2004|p=45}} Which goddess these images represent is not known, but the Egyptians adopted her iconography and came to regard her as an independent deity, [[Qetesh]],{{sfn|Cornelius|2004|pp=96\u201397}} whom they associated with Hathor.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=132}}\n\nHathor's solar character may have played a role in linking her with trade: she was believed to protect ships on the Nile and in the seas beyond Egypt, as she protected the barque of Ra in the sky.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=72\u201374}} The mythological wandering of the Eye goddess in Nubia or Libya gave her a connection with those lands as well.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nHathor was closely connected with the [[Sinai Peninsula]],{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} which was not considered part of Egypt proper but was the site of Egyptian mines for copper, [[turquoise]], and [[malachite]] during the Middle and New Kingdoms.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=52}} One of Hathor's epithets, \"Lady of ''Mefkat''\", may have referred specifically to turquoise or to all blue-green minerals. She was also called \"Lady of [[Egyptian faience|Faience]]\", a blue-green ceramic that Egyptians likened to turquoise.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=143}} Hathor was also worshipped at various quarries and mining sites in Egypt's [[Eastern Desert]], such as the [[amethyst]] mines of Wadi el-Hudi, where she was sometimes called \"Lady of Amethyst\".{{sfn|Espinel|2005|pp=61, 65\u201366}}\n\nSouth of Egypt, Hathor's influence was thought to have extended over the [[land of Punt]], which lay along the Red Sea coast and was a major source for the incense with which Hathor was linked, as well as with Nubia, northwest of Punt.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=72\u201374}} The [[autobiography of Harkhuf]], an official in the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (c. 2345\u20132181 BC), describes his expedition to a land in or near Nubia, from which he brought back great quantities of [[ebony]], panther skins, and incense for the king. The text describes these exotic goods as Hathor's gift to the pharaoh.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} Egyptian expeditions to mine gold in Nubia introduced her cult to the region during the Middle and New Kingdoms,{{sfn|Yellin|2012|pp=125\u2013128}} and New Kingdom pharaohs built several temples to her in the portions of Nubia that they ruled.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=227\u2013230}}\n\n===Afterlife===\n[[Image:BD Hathor Mistress of the West.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a cow whose head protrudes from a hill, in front of which stand papyrus stalks and a pyramidal chapel|Hathor, in bovine form, emerges from a hill representing the [[Theban necropolis]], in a copy of the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' from the 13th century BC]]\nHathor was one of several goddesses believed to assist deceased souls in the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]].{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=153}} One of these was [[Imentet]], the goddess of the west, who personified the [[necropolises]], or clusters of tombs, on the west bank of the Nile, and the realm of the afterlife itself. She was often regarded as a specialized manifestation of Hathor.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nJust as she crossed the boundary between Egypt and foreign lands, Hathor passed through the boundary between the living and the [[Duat]], the realm of the dead.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=166}} She helped the spirits of deceased humans enter the Duat and was closely linked with tomb sites, where that transition began.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=88, 164}} The [[Theban necropolis]], for example, was often portrayed as a stylized mountain with the cow of Hathor emerging from it.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=179\u2013180}} Her role as a sky goddess was also linked to the afterlife. Because the sky goddess\u2014either Nut or Hathor\u2014assisted Ra in his daily rebirth, she had an important part in [[Egyptian afterlife beliefs]], according to which deceased humans were reborn like the sun god.{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=82}} Coffins, tombs, and the underworld itself were interpreted as the womb of this goddess, from which the deceased soul would be reborn.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=170\u2013173}}{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=39\u201340, 110}}\n\nNut, Hathor, and Imentet could each, in different texts, lead the deceased into a place where they would receive food and drink for eternal sustenance. Thus, Hathor, as Imentet, often appears on tombs, welcoming the deceased person as her child into a blissful afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=152\u2013154, 170\u2013173}} In New Kingdom funerary texts and artwork, the afterlife was often illustrated as a pleasant, fertile garden, over which Hathor sometimes presided.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=42\u201343}} The welcoming afterlife goddess was often portrayed as a goddess in the form of a tree, giving water to the deceased. Nut most commonly filled this role, but the tree goddess was sometimes called Hathor instead.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nThe afterlife also had a sexual aspect. In the Osiris myth, the murdered god [[Osiris]] was resurrected when he copulated with Isis and conceived Horus. In solar ideology, Ra's union with the sky goddess allowed his own rebirth. Sex therefore enabled the rebirth of the deceased, and goddesses like Isis and Hathor served to rouse the deceased to new life. But they merely stimulated the male deities' regenerative powers, rather than playing the central role.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013229}}\n\nAncient Egyptians prefixed the names of the deceased with Osiris's name to connect them with his resurrection. For example, a woman named [[Henutmehyt]] would be dubbed \"Osiris-Henutmehyt\". Over time they increasingly associated the deceased with both male and female divine powers.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013229, 235\u2013236}} As early as the late Old Kingdom, women were sometimes said to join the worshippers of Hathor in the afterlife, just as men joined the following of Osiris. In the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] (c. 1070\u2013664 BC), Egyptians began to add Hathor's name to that of deceased women in place of that of Osiris. In some cases, women were called \"Osiris-Hathor\", indicating that they benefited from the revivifying power of both deities. In these late periods, Hathor was sometimes said to rule the afterlife as Osiris did.{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=251\u2013254}}\n\n==Iconography==\nHathor was often depicted as a cow bearing the sun disk between her horns, especially when shown nursing the king. She could also appear as a woman with the head of a cow. Her most common form, however, was a woman wearing a headdress of the horns and sun disk, often with a red or turquoise sheath dress, or a dress combining both colors. Sometimes the horns stood atop a low [[modius (headdress)|modius]] or the vulture headdress that Egyptian queens often wore in the New Kingdom. Because Isis adopted the same headdress during the New Kingdom, the two goddesses can be distinguished only if labeled in writing. When in the role of Imentet, Hathor wore the [[emblem of the west]] upon her head instead of the horned headdress.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=143\u2013144, 148}} The Seven Hathors were sometimes portrayed as a set of seven cows, accompanied by a minor sky and afterlife deity called the Bull of the West.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 175}}\n\nSome animals other than cattle could represent Hathor. The uraeus was a common motif in Egyptian art and could represent a variety of goddesses who were identified with the Eye of Ra.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=198\u2013199}} When Hathor was depicted as a uraeus, it represented the ferocious and protective aspects of her character. She also appeared as a lioness, and this form had a similar meaning.{{sfn|Roberts|1997|pp=8\u201310}} In contrast, the [[domestic cat]], which was sometimes connected with Hathor, often represented the Eye goddess's pacified form.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=190\u2013197}} When portrayed as a sycamore tree, Hathor was usually shown with the upper body of her human form emerging from the trunk.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\nLike other goddesses, Hathor might carry a stalk of papyrus as a staff, though she could instead hold a ''[[Was-sceptre|was]]'' staff, a symbol of power that was usually restricted to male deities.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=143}} The only goddesses who used the ''was'' were those, like Hathor, who were linked with the Eye of Ra.{{sfn|Graham|2001|p=166}} She also commonly carried a sistrum or a ''menat'' necklace. The sistrum came in two varieties: a simple loop shape or the more complex ''naos'' sistrum, which was shaped to resemble a ''[[Cella#Egyptian temples|naos]]'' shrine and flanked by [[volute]]s resembling the antennae of the Bat emblem.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=153\u2013159}} The ''[[menat]]'' necklace, made up of many strands of beads, was shaken in ceremonies in Hathor's honor, similarly to the sistrum.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} Images of it were sometimes seen as personifications of Hathor herself.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=278}} Mirrors were another of her symbols, because in Egypt they were often made of gold or bronze and therefore symbolized the sun disk, and because they were connected with beauty and femininity. Some mirror handles were made in the shape of Hathor's face.{{sfn|Wilkinson|1993|pp=32, 83}}\n\nHathor was sometimes represented as a human face with bovine ears, seen from the front rather than in the profile-based perspective that was typical of Egyptian art. When she appears in this form, the tresses on either side of her face often curl into loops. This mask-like face was placed on the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of columns beginning in the late Old Kingdom. Columns of this style were used in many temples to Hathor and other goddesses.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=135\u2013139}} These columns have two or four faces, which may represent the duality between different aspects of the goddess or the watchfulness of Hathor of the Four Faces. The designs of Hathoric columns have a complex relationship with those of sistra.

Hathor was one of the few deities to receive such donations.{{sfn|Goedicke|1978|pp=118\u2013123}} Late Old Kingdom rulers especially promoted the cult of Hathor in the provinces, as a way of binding those regions to the royal court. She may have absorbed the traits of contemporary provincial goddesses.{{sfn|Morris|2011|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nMany female royals, though not reigning queens, held positions in the cult during the Old Kingdom.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=222\u2013226, 231}} [[Mentuhotep II]], who became the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom despite having no relation to the Old Kingdom rulers, sought to legitimize his rule by portraying himself as Hathor's son. The first images of the Hathor-cow suckling the king date to his reign, and several priestesses of Hathor were depicted as though they were his wives, although he may not have actually married them.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=231}}{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=135\u2013136}} In the course of the Middle Kingdom, queens were increasingly seen as directly embodying the goddess, just as the king embodied Ra.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=234}} The emphasis on the queen as Hathor continued through the New Kingdom. Queens were portrayed with the headdress of Hathor beginning in the late Eighteenth Dynasty. An image of the [[sed festival]] of [[Amenhotep III]], meant to celebrate and renew his rule, shows the king together with Hathor and his queen [[Tiye]], which could mean that the king symbolically married the goddess in the course of the festival.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\n[[Hatshepsut]], a woman who ruled as a pharaoh in the early New Kingdom, emphasized her relationship to Hathor in a different way.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=105\u2013107}} She used [[ancient Egyptian royal titulary|names and titles]] that linked her to a variety of goddesses, including Hathor, so as to legitimize her rule in what was normally a male position.{{sfn|Robins|1999|pp=107\u2013112}} She built several temples to Hathor and placed her own [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut|mortuary temple]], which incorporated a chapel dedicated to the goddess, at [[Deir el-Bahari]], which had been a cult site of Hathor since the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=105\u2013107}}\n\nThe preeminence of Amun during the New Kingdom gave greater visibility to his consort Mut, and in the course of the period, Isis began appearing in roles that traditionally belonged to Hathor alone, such as that of the goddess in the solar barque. Despite the growing prominence of these deities, Hathor remained important, particularly in relation to fertility, sexuality, and queenship, throughout the New Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=119\u2013120, 178\u2013179}}\n\nAfter the New Kingdom, Isis increasingly overshadowed Hathor and other goddesses as she took on their characteristics.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=129}} In the [[Ptolemaic period]] (305\u201330 BC), when [[Greeks]] governed Egypt and [[Ancient Greek religion|their religion]] developed a complex relationship with that of Egypt, the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] adopted and modified the Egyptian ideology of kingship. Beginning with [[Arsinoe II]], wife of [[Ptolemy II]], the Ptolemies closely linked their queens with Isis and with several Greek goddesses, particularly their own goddess of love and sexuality, [[Aphrodite]].{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=312, 339}} Nevertheless, when the Greeks referred to Egyptian gods by the names of their own gods (a practice called ''[[interpretatio Graeca]]''), they sometimes called Hathor Aphrodite.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=141}} Traits of Isis, Hathor, and Aphrodite were all combined to justify the treatment of Ptolemaic queens as goddesses. Thus, the poet [[Callimachus]] alluded to the myth of Hathor's lost lock of hair when praising [[Berenice II]] for sacrificing her own hair to Aphrodite,{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=346\u2013348}} and iconographic traits that Isis and Hathor shared, such as the bovine horns and vulture headdress, appeared on images portraying Ptolemaic queens as Aphrodite.{{sfn|Cheshire|2007|pp=157\u2013163}}\n\n===Temples in Egypt===\n[[File:Dendera hypostyle hall crosswise.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Room with tall stone columns topped by faces of women. The columns, walls, and ceiling are covered in painted reliefs.|[[Hypostyle]] hall of the [[Temple of Hathor at Dendera]], first century AD]]\nMore temples were dedicated to Hathor than to any other Egyptian goddess.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=166}} During the Old Kingdom her most important center of worship was in the region of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], where \"Hathor of the Sycomore\" was worshipped at many sites throughout the [[Memphite Necropolis]]. During the New Kingdom era, the temple of Hathor of the Southern Sycomore was her main temple in Memphis.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=219\u2013221}} At that site she was described as the daughter of the city's main deity, [[Ptah]].{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=82}} The cult of Ra and Atum at Heliopolis, northeast of Memphis, included a temple to Hathor-Nebethetepet that was probably built in the Middle Kingdom. A willow and a sycomore tree stood near the sanctuary and may have been worshipped as manifestations of the goddess.{{sfn|Quirke|2001|pp=102\u2013105}} A few cities farther north in the [[Nile Delta]], such as [[Yamu]] and [[Terenuthis]], also had temples to her.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=108, 111}}\n\nAs the rulers of the Old Kingdom made an effort to develop towns in Upper and [[Middle Egypt]], several cult centers of Hathor were founded across the region, at sites such as [[Cusae]], [[Akhmim]], and [[Naga ed-Der]].{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=226, 229}} In the [[First Intermediate Period]] (c. 2181\u20132055) her cult statue from Dendera was periodically carried to the Theban necropolis. During the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, Mentuhotep II established a permanent cult center for her in the necropolis at Deir el-Bahari.{{sfn|Goedicke|1991|pp=245, 252}} The nearby village of [[Deir el-Medina]], home to the tomb workers of the necropolis during the New Kingdom, also contained temples of Hathor. One continued to function and was periodically rebuilt as late as the Ptolemaic Period, centuries after the village was abandoned.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nDendera, Hathor's oldest temple in Upper Egypt, dates to at least to the Fourth Dynasty.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=227}} After the end of the Old Kingdom it surpassed her Memphite temples in importance.{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=83}} Many kings made additions to the temple complex through Egyptian history. The last version of the temple was built in the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods and is today one of the best-preserved Egyptian temples from that time.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=149\u2013151}}\n\nIn the Old Kingdom, most priests of Hathor, including the highest ranks, were women. Many of these women were members of the royal family.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=240\u2013241}} In the course of the Middle Kingdom, women were increasingly excluded from the highest priestly positions, at the same time that queens were becoming more closely tied to Hathor's cult. Thus, non-royal women disappeared from the high ranks of Hathor's priesthood,{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=233\u2013234}} although women continued to serve as musicians and singers in temple cults across Egypt.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=243\u2013244}}\n\nThe most frequent temple rite for any deity was the daily offering ritual, in which the cult image, or statue, of a deity would be clothed and given food.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=328}} The daily ritual was largely the same in every Egyptian temple,{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=328}} although the goods given as offerings could vary according to which deity received them.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126\u2013128}} Wine and beer were common offerings in all temples, but especially in rituals in Hathor's honor,{{sfn|Poo|2010|pp=2\u20133}} and she and the goddesses related to her often received sistra and ''menat'' necklaces.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126\u2013128}} In Late and Ptolemaic times, they were also offered a pair of mirrors, representing the sun and the moon.{{sfn|Derriks|2001|pp=421\u2013422}}\n\n===Festivals===\nMany of Hathor's annual festivals were celebrated with drinking and dancing that served a ritual purpose. Revelers at these festivals may have aimed to reach a state of [[religious ecstasy]], which was otherwise rare or nonexistent in ancient Egyptian religion. Graves-Brown suggests that celebrants in Hathor's festivals aimed to reach an [[altered state of consciousness]] to allow them interact with the divine realm.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=166\u2013169}} An example is the Festival of Drunkenness, commemorating the return of the Eye of Ra, which was celebrated on the twentieth day of the [[Thout|month of Thout]] at temples to Hathor and to other Eye goddesses. It was celebrated as early as the Middle Kingdom, but it is best known from Ptolemaic and Roman times.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=166\u2013169}} The dancing, eating and drinking that took place during the Festival of Drunkenness represented the opposite of the sorrow, hunger, and thirst that the Egyptians associated with death. Whereas the rampages of the Eye of Ra brought death to humans, the Festival of Drunkenness celebrated life, abundance, and joy.{{sfn|Frandsen|1999|pp=131, 142\u2013143}}\n\nIn a local Theban festival known as the [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley]], which began to be celebrated in the Middle Kingdom, the cult image of Amun from the [[Precinct of Amun-Re|Temple of Karnak]] visited the temples in the Theban Necropolis while members of the community went to the tombs of their deceased relatives to drink, eat, and celebrate.{{sfn|Teeter|2011|pp=67\u201368}} Hathor was not involved in this festival until the early New Kingdom,{{sfn|Sadek|1988|p=49}} after which Amun's overnight stay in the temples at Deir el-Bahari came to be seen as his sexual union with her.{{sfn|Teeter|2011|p=70}}\n\nSeveral temples in Ptolemaic times, including that of Dendera, observed the Egyptian new year with a series of ceremonies in which images of the temple deity were supposed to be revitalized by contact with the sun god. On the days leading up to the new year, Dendera's statue of Hathor was taken to the ''[[wabet]]'', a specialized room in the temple, and placed under a ceiling decorated with images of the sky and sun. On the first day of the new year, the first day of the [[Thoth (month)|month of Thoth]], the Hathor image was carried up to the roof to be bathed in genuine sunlight.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=193\u2013198}}\n\nThe best-documented festival focused on Hathor is another Ptolemaic celebration, the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion. It took place over fourteen days in the month of [[Epiphi]].{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=93}}{{sfn|Richter|2016|p=4}} Hathor's cult image from Dendera was carried by boat to several temple sites to visit the gods of those temples. The endpoint of the journey was the Temple of Horus at [[Edfu]], where the Hathor statue from Dendera met that of Horus of Edfu and the two were placed together.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=94}} On one day of the festival, these images were carried out to a shrine where primordial deities such as the sun god and the [[Ennead]] were said to be buried. The texts say the divine couple performed offering rites for these entombed gods.{{sfn|Verner|2013|pp=437\u2013439}} Many Egyptologists regard this festival as a [[hieros gamos|ritual marriage]] between Horus and Hathor, although Martin Stadler challenges this view, arguing that it instead represented the rejuvenation of the buried creator gods.{{sfn|Stadler|2008|pp=4\u20136}} C. J. Bleeker thought the Beautiful Reunion was another celebration of the return of the Distant Goddess, citing allusions in the temple's festival texts to the myth of the solar eye.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=98\u2013101}} Barbara Richter argues that the festival represented all three things at once. She points out that the birth of Horus and Hathor's son Ihy was celebrated at Dendera nine months after the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion, implying that Hathor's visit to Horus represented Ihy's conception.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=4, 202\u2013205}}\n\nThe third month of the [[Egyptian calendar]], [[Hathor (month)|Hathor or Athyr]], was named for the goddess. Festivities in her honor took place throughout the month, although they are not recorded in the texts from Dendera.{{sfn|Verner|2013|p=43}}\n\n===Worship outside Egypt===\n[[File:Temple of Hathor in Timna Park in summer 2011 (1).JPG|thumb|upright|right|alt=Foundations of a small stone wall at the base of a desert cliff|Remains of the Hathor shrine in the [[Timna Valley]]]]\nEgyptian kings as early as the Old Kingdom donated goods to the temple of Baalat Gebal in Byblos, using the syncretism of Baalat with Hathor to cement their close trading relationship with Byblos.{{sfn|Espinel|2002|pp=116\u2013118}} A temple to Hathor as Lady of Byblos was built during the reign of [[Thutmose III]], although it may simply have been a shrine within the temple of Baalat.{{sfn|Traunecker|2001|p=110}} After the breakdown of the New Kingdom, Hathor's prominence in Byblos diminished along with Egypt's trade links to the city. A few artifacts from the early first millennium BC suggest that the Egyptians began equating Baalat with Isis at that time.{{sfn|Zernecke|2013|pp=227\u2013230}} A myth about Isis's presence in Byblos, related by the Greek author [[Plutarch]] in his work ''On Isis and Osiris'' in the 2nd century AD, suggests that by his time Isis had entirely supplanted Hathor in the city.{{sfn|Hollis|2009|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nEgyptians in the Sinai built a few temples in the region. The largest was a complex dedicated primarily to Hathor as patroness of mining at [[Serabit el-Khadim]], on the west side of the peninsula.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=238\u2013239}} It was occupied from the middle of the Middle Kingdom to near the end of the New.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=55\u201357}} The [[Timna Valley]], on the fringes of the Egyptian empire on the east side of the peninsula, was the site of seasonal mining expeditions during the New Kingdom. It included a shrine to Hathor that was probably deserted during the off-season. The local [[Midianites]], whom the Egyptians used as part of the mining workforce, may have given offerings to Hathor as their overseers did. After the Egyptians abandoned the site in the Twentieth Dynasty, however, the Midianites converted the shrine to a tent shrine devoted to their own deities.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=59\u201369}}\n\nIn contrast, the Nubians in the south fully incorporated Hathor into their religion. During the New Kingdom, when most of Nubia was under Egyptian control, pharaohs dedicated several temples in Nubia to Hathor, such as those at [[Faras]] and [[Mirgissa]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=227\u2013230}} Amenhotep III and [[Ramesses II]] both built temples in Nubia that celebrated their respective queens as manifestations of female deities, including Hathor: Amenhotep's wife Tiye at [[Sedeinga]]{{sfn|Morkot|2012|pp=325\u2013326}} and Ramesses's wife [[Nefertari]] at the [[Abu Simbel temples#Small Temple|Small Temple of Abu Simbel]].{{sfn|Fisher|2012|pp=357\u2013358}} The independent Kingdom of Kush, which emerged in Nubia after the collapse of the New Kingdom, based its beliefs about [[List of monarchs of Kush|Kushite kings]] on the royal ideology of Egypt. Therefore, Hathor, Isis, Mut, and Nut were all seen as the mythological mother of each Kushite king and equated with his female relatives, such as the ''[[kandake]]'', the Kushite queen or [[queen mother]], who had prominent roles in Kushite religion.{{sfn|Kendall|2010b}} At [[Jebel Barkal]], a site sacred to Amun, the Kushite king [[Taharqa]] built a pair of temples, one dedicated to Hathor and [[Temple of Mut, Jebel Barkal|one to Mut]] as consorts of Amun, replacing New Kingdom Egyptian temples that may have been dedicated to these same goddesses.{{sfn|Kendall|2010a|pp=1, 12}} But Isis was the most prominent of the Egyptian goddesses worshipped in Nubia, and her status there increased over time. Thus, in the Meroitic period of Nubian history (c. 300 BC \u2013 AD 400), Hathor appeared in temples mainly as a companion to Isis.{{sfn|Yellin|2012|pp=128, 133}}\n\n===Popular worship===\n[[File:Plaque of a woman giving birth assisted by Hathor.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Plaque showing a woman squatting while cow-headed women stand at either side|Ptolemaic plaque of a woman giving birth assisted by two figures of Hathor, fourth to first century BC]]\nIn addition to formal and public rituals at temples, Egyptians privately worshipped deities for personal reasons, including at their homes. Birth was hazardous for both mother and child in ancient Egypt, yet children were much desired. Thus fertility and safe childbirth are among the most prominent concerns in their popular religion, and fertility deities such as Hathor and [[Taweret]] were commonly worshipped in household shrines. Egyptian women squatted on bricks while giving birth, and the only known surviving birth brick from ancient Egypt is decorated with an image of a woman holding her child flanked by images of Hathor.{{sfn|Ritner|2008|pp=173\u2013175, 181}} In Roman times, [[terracotta]] figurines, sometimes found in a domestic context, depicted a woman with an elaborate headdress exposing her genitals, as Hathor did to cheer up Ra.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=218\u2013219}} The meaning of these figurines is not known,{{sfn|Sandri|2012|pp=637\u2013638}} but they are often thought to represent Hathor or Isis combined with Aphrodite making a gesture that represented fertility or protection against evil.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nHathor was one of a handful of deities, including Amun, Ptah, and Thoth, who were commonly prayed to for help with personal problems.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=349\u2013351}} Many Egyptians left offerings at temples or small shrines dedicated to the gods they prayed to. Most offerings to Hathor were used for their symbolism, not for their intrinsic value. Cloths painted with images of Hathor were common, as were plaques and figurines depicting her animal forms. Different types of offerings may have symbolized different goals on the part of the donor, but their meaning is usually unknown. Images of Hathor alluded to her mythical roles, like depictions of the maternal cow in the marsh.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=119, 347, 354\u2013355}} Offerings of sistra may have been meant to appease the goddess's dangerous aspects and bring out her positive ones,{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=157\u2013158}} while [[phalli]] represented a prayer for fertility, as shown by an inscription found on one example.{{sfn|Lesko|2008|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\nSome Egyptians also left written prayers to Hathor, inscribed on [[stela]]e or written as graffiti.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=349\u2013351}} Prayers to some deities, such as Amun, show that they were thought to punish wrongdoers and heal people who repented for their misbehavior. In contrast, prayers to Hathor mention only the benefits she could grant, such as abundant food during life and a well-provisioned burial after death.{{sfn|Sadek|1988|pp=89, 114\u2013115}}\n\n===Funerary practices===\n[[File:Nuovo regno, la dea hathor accoglie seth I, dalla valle dei re, 1294-1279 ac ca..JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Relief of Hathor holding a man's hand and lifting her menat necklace for him to grasp|Hathor welcoming [[Seti I]] into the afterlife, 13th century BC]]\nAs an afterlife deity, Hathor appeared frequently in funerary texts and art. In the early New Kingdom, for instance, Osiris, [[Anubis]], and Hathor were the three deities most commonly found in royal tomb decoration.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=110}} In that period she often appeared as the goddess welcoming the dead into the afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=171}} Other images referred to her more obliquely. Reliefs in Old Kingdom tombs show men and women performing a ritual called \"shaking the papyrus\". The significance of this rite is not known, but inscriptions sometimes say it was performed \"for Hathor\", and shaking papyrus stalks produces a rustling sound that may have been likened to the rattling of a sistrum.{{sfn|Woods|2011|pp=314\u2013316}} Other Hathoric imagery in tombs included the cow emerging from the mountain of the necropolis{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=179\u2013180}} and the seated figure of the goddess presiding over a garden in the afterlife.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=42\u201343}} Images of Nut were often painted or incised inside coffins, indicating that the coffin was her womb, from which the occupant would be reborn in the afterlife. In the Third Intermediate Period, Hathor began to be placed on the floor of the coffin, with Nut on the interior of the lid.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=39\u201340, 110}}\n\nTomb art from the Eighteenth Dynasty often shows people drinking, dancing, and playing music, as well as holding ''menat'' necklaces and sistra\u2014all imagery that alluded to Hathor. These images may represent private feasts that were celebrated in front of tombs to commemorate the people buried there, or they may show gatherings at temple festivals such as the Beautiful Festival of the Valley.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013136, 144\u2013147}} Festivals were thought to allow contact between the human and divine realms, and by extension, between the living and the dead. Thus, texts from tombs often expressed a wish that the deceased would be able to participate in festivals, primarily those dedicated to Osiris.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=225}} Tombs' festival imagery, however, may refer to festivals involving Hathor, such as the Festival of Drunkenness, or to the private feasts, which were also closely connected with her.

As a [[sky deity]], she was the mother or consort of the sky god [[Horus]] and the [[sun god]] [[Ra]], both of whom were connected with kingship, and thus she was the symbolic mother of their earthly representatives, the [[pharaoh]]s. She was one of several goddesses who acted as the [[Eye of Ra]], Ra's feminine counterpart, and in this form she had a vengeful aspect that protected him from his enemies. Her beneficent side represented music, dance, joy, love, sexuality and maternal care, and she acted as the consort of several male deities and the mother of their sons. These two aspects of the goddess exemplified the [[women in ancient Egypt|Egyptian conception]] of [[femininity]]. Hathor crossed boundaries between worlds, helping deceased [[ancient Egyptian conception of the soul|souls]] in the transition to the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]].\n\nHathor was often depicted as a [[Cattle in religion|cow]], symbolizing her maternal and celestial aspect, although her most common form was a woman wearing a headdress of cow horns and a sun disk. She could also be represented as a lioness, cobra, or [[Ficus sycomorus|sycamore tree]].\n\nCattle goddesses similar to Hathor were portrayed in [[art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]] in the fourth millennium BC, but she may not have appeared until the [[Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686\u20132181 BC). With the patronage of Old Kingdom rulers she became one of Egypt's most important deities. More [[Egyptian temple|temples]] were dedicated to her than to any other goddess; her most prominent temple was [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. She was also worshipped in the temples of her male consorts. The Egyptians connected her with foreign lands such as [[Nubia]] and [[Canaan]] and their valuable goods, such as [[incense]] and [[semiprecious]] stones, and some of the peoples in those lands adopted her worship. In Egypt, she was one of the deities commonly invoked in private prayers and [[votive offerings]], particularly by women desiring children.\n\nDuring the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC), goddesses such as [[Mut]] and [[Isis]] encroached on Hathor's position in royal ideology, but she remained one of the most widely worshipped deities. After the end of the New Kingdom, Hathor was increasingly overshadowed by Isis, but she continued to be venerated until the [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|extinction of ancient Egyptian religion]] in the early centuries AD.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Narmer Palette, Egypt, c. 3100 BC - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09726.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Stone slate carved with reliefs|Replica of the [[Narmer Palette]], c. 31st century BC. The face of a woman with the horns and ears of a cow, representing Hathor or [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], appears twice at the top of the palette and in a row below the belt of the king.]]\n[[File:Narmer palette 83d40m hathor atop columns below belt of king.png|thumb|right|Detail on the Narmar Palette below the belt of the king shows Hathor atop four columns]]\nImages of [[Ancient Egyptian cattle|cattle]] appear frequently in the [[art of ancient Egypt|artwork]] of [[Predynastic Egypt]] (before c. 3100 BC), as do images of women with upraised, curved arms reminiscent of the shape of bovine horns. Both types of imagery may represent [[ancient Egyptian deities|goddesses]] connected with [[Cattle in religion|cattle]].{{sfn|Hassan|1992|p=15}} Cows are [[cattle in religion and mythology|venerated in many cultures]], including ancient Egypt, as symbols of motherhood and nourishment, because they care for their calves and supply humans with milk. The [[list of ancient Egyptian palettes#Gerzeh Palette|Gerzeh Palette]], a [[cosmetic palette|stone palette]] from the [[Naqada II]] period of prehistory (c. 3500\u20133200 BC), shows the silhouette of a cow's head with inward-curving horns surrounded by stars. The palette suggests that this cow was also linked with the sky, as were several goddesses from later times who were represented in this form: Hathor, [[Mehet-Weret]], and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]].{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=15\u201317}}\n\nDespite these early precedents, Hathor is not unambiguously mentioned or depicted until the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (c. 2613\u20132494 BC) of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]],{{sfn|Wilkinson|1999|pp=244\u2013245}} although several artifacts that refer to her may date to the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] (c. 3100\u20132686 BC).{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=214}} When Hathor does clearly appear, her horns curve outward, rather than inward like those in Predynastic art.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=11\u201313}}\n\nA bovine deity with inward-curving horns appears on the [[Narmer Palette]] from near the start of Egyptian history, both atop the palette and on the belt or apron of the king, [[Narmer]]. The Egyptologist Henry George Fischer suggested this deity may be [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], a goddess who was later depicted with a woman's face and inward-curling horns, seemingly reflecting the curve of the cow horns.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=11\u201313}} The Egyptologist Lana Troy, however, identifies a passage in the ''[[Pyramid Texts]]'' from the late Old Kingdom that connects Hathor with the \"apron\" of the king, reminiscent of the goddess on Narmer's garments, and suggests the goddess on the Narmer Palette is Hathor rather than Bat,{{sfn|Wilkinson|1999|pp=244\u2013245}}{{sfn|Troy|1986|p=54}} and the motif resembles the head of Hathor atop the columns of temples built throughout many dynasties. \n\nIn the Fourth Dynasty, Hathor rose rapidly to prominence.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=81\u201383}} She supplanted an early crocodile god who was worshipped at [[Dendera]] in [[Upper Egypt]] to become Dendera's patron deity, and she increasingly absorbed the cult of Bat in the neighboring region of [[Hu, Egypt|Hu]], so that in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055\u20131650 BC) the two deities fused into one.{{sfn|Fischer|1962|pp=7, 14\u201315}} The theology surrounding the [[pharaoh]] in the Old Kingdom, unlike that of earlier times, focused heavily on the sun god [[Ra]] as [[king of the gods]] and father and patron of the earthly king. Hathor ascended with Ra and became his mythological wife, and thus divine mother of the pharaoh.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=81\u201383}}\n\n==Roles==\nHathor took many forms and appeared in a wide variety of roles.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 145}} The Egyptologist Robyn Gillam suggests that these diverse forms emerged when the royal goddess promoted by the Old Kingdom court subsumed many local goddesses worshipped by the general populace, who were then treated as manifestations of her.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=217\u2013218}} Egyptian texts often speak of the manifestations of the goddess as \"Seven Hathors\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 145}} or, less commonly, of many more Hathors\u2014as many as 362.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=71\u201372}} For these reasons, Gillam calls her \"a type of deity rather than a single entity\".{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=217\u2013218}} Hathor's diversity reflects the diversity of traits that the Egyptians associated with goddesses. More than any other deity, she exemplifies the [[women in ancient Egypt|Egyptian perception]] of [[femininity]].{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n===Sky goddess===\nHathor was given the [[epithet]]s \"mistress of the sky\" and \"mistress of the stars\", and was said to dwell in the sky with Ra and other sun deities. Egyptians thought of the sky as a body of water through which the sun god sailed, and they connected it with the waters from which, according to their [[ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation myths]], the sun emerged at the beginning of time. This cosmic mother goddess was often represented as a cow. Hathor and Mehet-Weret were both thought of as the cow who birthed the sun god and placed him between her horns. Like Nut, Hathor was said to give birth to the sun god each dawn.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=31\u201334, 46\u201347}}\n\nHathor's [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name was ''\u1e25wt-\u1e25rw''{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=130}} or ''\u1e25wt-\u1e25r''.{{sfn|Billing|2004|p=39}} It is typically translated \"house of Horus\" but can also be rendered as \"my house is the sky\".{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=25, 48}} The falcon god [[Horus]] represented, among other things, the sun and sky. The \"house\" referred to may be the sky in which Horus lives, or the goddess's womb from which he, as a sun god, is born each day.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}}\n\n===Solar goddess===\n{{further|Eye of Ra}}\nHathor was a solar deity, a feminine counterpart to sun gods such as Horus and Ra, and was a member of the divine entourage that accompanied Ra as he sailed through the sky in his [[barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|barque]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}} She was commonly called the \"Golden One\", referring to the radiance of the sun, and texts from [[Dendera Temple complex|her temple at Dendera]] say \"her rays illuminate the whole earth.\"{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=128, 184\u2013185}} She was sometimes fused with another goddess, [[Nebethetepet]], whose name can mean \"Lady of the Offering\", \"Lady of Contentment\",{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=156}} or \"Lady of the Vulva\".{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=155}} At Ra's cult center of [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], Hathor-Nebethetepet was worshipped as his consort,{{sfn|Quirke|2001|pp=102\u2013105}} and the Egyptologist Rudolf Anthes argued that Hathor's name referred to a mythical \"house of Horus\" at Heliopolis that was connected with the ideology of kingship.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=218}}\n\nShe was one of many goddesses to take the role of the Eye of Ra, a feminine personification of the disk of the sun and an extension of Ra's own power. Ra was sometimes portrayed inside the disk, which Troy interprets as meaning that the Eye goddess was thought of as a womb from which the sun god was born. Hathor's seemingly contradictory roles as mother, wife, and daughter of Ra reflected the daily cycle of the sun. At sunset the god entered the body of the goddess, impregnating her and fathering the deities born from her womb at sunrise: himself and the Eye goddess, who would later give birth to him. Ra gave rise to his daughter, the Eye goddess, who in turn gave rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.{{sfn|Troy|1986|pp=21\u201323, 25\u201327}}\n\nThe Eye of Ra protected the sun god from his enemies and was often represented as a [[uraeus]], or rearing [[cobra]], or as a lioness.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=129\u2013130}} A form of the Eye of Ra known as \"Hathor of the Four Faces\", represented by a set of four cobras, was said to face in each of the [[cardinal directions]] to watch for threats to the sun god.{{sfn|Ritner|1990|p=39}} A group of myths, known from the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC) onward, describe what happens when the Eye goddess rampages uncontrolled. In the [[ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary text]] known as the ''[[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]'', Ra sends Hathor as the Eye of Ra to punish humans for plotting rebellion against his rule. She becomes the lioness goddess [[Sekhmet]] and massacres the rebellious humans, but Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state reverts to being the benign and beautiful Hathor.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=169\u2013170}} Related to this story is the myth of the Distant Goddess, from the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] periods. The Eye goddess, sometimes in the form of Hathor, rebels against Ra's control and rampages freely in a foreign land: [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] west of Egypt or [[Nubia]] to the south. Weakened by the loss of his Eye, Ra sends another god, such as [[Thoth]], to bring her back to him.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=71\u201374}} Once pacified, the goddess returns to become the consort of the sun god or of the god who brings her back.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=130}} The two aspects of the Eye goddess\u2014violent and dangerous versus beautiful and joyful\u2014reflected the Egyptian belief that women, as the Egyptologist Carolyn Graves-Brown puts it, \"encompassed both extreme passions of fury and love.\"{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\n===Music, dance, and joy===\n[[File:Funerary banquet of Nebamun.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|alt=Painting of elaborately dressed men and women. Some women clap and play flutes while others dance.|Banquet scene from the tomb chapel of [[Nebamun]], 14th century BC. Its imagery of music and dancing alludes to Hathor.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013134}}]]\nEgyptian religion celebrated the sensory pleasures of life, believed to be among the gods' gifts to humanity. Egyptians ate, drank, danced, and played music at their religious festivals. They perfumed the air with flowers and [[incense]]. Many of Hathor's epithets link her to celebration; she is called the mistress of music, dance, garlands, [[myrrh]], and drunkenness. In hymns and temple reliefs, musicians play tambourines, harps, lyres, and sistra in Hathor's honor.{{sfn|Finnestad|1999|pp=113\u2013115}} The [[sistrum]], a rattle-like instrument, was particularly important in Hathor's worship. Sistra had erotic connotations and, by extension, alluded to the creation of new life.{{sfn|Manniche|2010|pp=13\u201314, 16\u201317}}\n\nThese aspects of Hathor were linked with the myth of the Eye of Ra. The Eye was pacified by beer in the story of the Destruction of Mankind. In some versions of the Distant Goddess myth, the wandering Eye's wildness abated when she was appeased with products of civilization like music, dance, and wine. The water of the annual [[inundation of the Nile]], colored red by sediment, was likened to wine, and to the red-dyed beer in the Destruction of Mankind. Festivals during the inundation therefore incorporated drink, music, and dance as a way to appease the returning goddess.{{sfn|Poo|2009|pp=153\u2013157}} A text from the [[Temple of Edfu]] says of Hathor, \"the gods play the sistrum for her, the goddesses dance for her to dispel her bad temper.\"{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=57}} A hymn to the goddess [[Raet-Tawy]] as a form of Hathor at the temple of [[Medamud]] describes the Festival of Drunkenness as part of her mythic return to Egypt.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|p=48}} Women carry bouquets of flowers, drunken revelers play drums, and people and animals from foreign lands dance for her as she enters the temple's festival booth. The noise of the celebration drives away hostile powers and ensures the goddess will remain in her joyful form as she awaits the male god of the temple, her mythological consort [[Montu]], whose son she will bear.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=54, 62, 91\u201394}}\n\n===Sexuality, beauty, and love===\nHathor's joyful, ecstatic side indicates her feminine, procreative power. In some creation myths she helped produce the world itself.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=138}} [[Atum]], a creator god who contained all things within himself, was said to have produced his children [[Shu (Egyptian god)|Shu]] and [[Tefnut]], and thus begun the process of creation, by masturbating. The hand he used for this act, the Hand of Atum, represented the female aspect of himself and could be personified by Hathor, Nebethetepet, or another goddess, [[Iusaaset]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=99, 141, 156}} In a late creation myth from the [[Ptolemaic Period]] (332\u201330 BC), the god [[Khonsu]] is put in a central role, and Hathor is the goddess with whom Khonsu mates to enable creation.{{sfn|Cruz-Uribe|1994|pp=185, 187\u2013188}}\n\nHathor could be the consort of many male gods, of whom Ra was only the most prominent. [[Mut]] was the usual consort of [[Amun]], the preeminent deity during the New Kingdom who was often linked with Ra. But Mut was rarely portrayed alongside Amun in contexts related to sex or fertility, and in those circumstances, Hathor or Isis stood at his side instead.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=155}} In the late periods of Egyptian history, the form of Hathor from Dendera and the form of Horus from Edfu were considered husband and wife{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=127}} and in different versions of the myth of the Distant Goddess, Hathor-Raettawy was the consort of Montu{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=47, 69}} and Hathor-Tefnut the consort of Shu.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|p=197}}\n\nHathor's sexual side was seen in some [[Ancient Egyptian literature#Narrative tales and stories|short stories]]. In a cryptic fragment of a Middle Kingdom story, known as \"The Tale of the Herdsman\", a herdsman encounters a hairy, animal-like goddess in a marsh and reacts with terror. On another day he encounters her as a nude, alluring woman. Most Egyptologists who study this story think this woman is Hathor or a goddess like her, one who can be wild and dangerous or benign and erotic. Thomas Schneider interprets the text as implying that between his two encounters with the goddess the herdsman has done something to pacify her.{{sfn|Schneider|2007|pp=315\u2013317}} In \"[[The Contendings of Horus and Set]]\", a New Kingdom short story about the [[Osiris myth#Conflict of Horus and Set|dispute between those two gods]], Ra is upset after being insulted by another god, [[Babi (mythology)|Babi]], and lies on his back alone. After some time, Hathor exposes her genitals to Ra, making him laugh and get up again to perform his duties as ruler of the gods. Life and order were thought to be dependent on Ra's activity, and the story implies that Hathor averted the disastrous consequences of his idleness. Her act may have lifted Ra's spirits partly because it sexually aroused him, although why he laughed is not fully understood.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=198\u2013199, 201, 207}}\n\nHathor was praised for her beautiful hair. Egyptian literature contains allusions to a myth not clearly described in any surviving texts, in which Hathor lost a lock of hair that represented her sexual allure. One text compares this loss with Horus's loss of his [[Eye of Horus|divine Eye]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]]'s loss of his testicles during the struggle between the two gods, implying that the loss of Hathor's lock was as catastrophic for her as the maiming of Horus and Set was for them.{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=346\u2013348}}\n\nHathor was called \"mistress of love\", as an extension of her sexual aspect. In the series of love poems from Papyrus Chester Beatty I, from the [[Twentieth Dynasty]] (c. 1189\u20131077 BC), men and women ask Hathor to bring their lovers to them: \"I prayed to her [Hathor] and she heard my prayer. She destined my mistress [loved one] for me. And she came of her own free will to see me.\"{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===Motherhood and queenship===\n[[File:Hatshepsut temple5.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Relief of a cow with a disk between her horns. A human wearing a crown drinks from her udders.|Hathor as a cow suckling [[Hatshepsut]], a female pharaoh, at Hatshepsut's [[temple of Hatshepsut|temple at Deir el-Bahari]], 15th century BC]]\nHathor was considered the mother of various child deities. As suggested by her name, she was often thought of as both Horus's mother and consort.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=82\u201383}} As both the king's wife and his heir's mother, Hathor was the mythic counterpart of human queens.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=130}}\n\nIsis and Osiris were considered Horus's parents in the [[Osiris myth]] as far back as the late Old Kingdom, but the relationship between Horus and Hathor may be older still. If so, Horus only came to be linked with Isis and Osiris as the Osiris myth emerged during the Old Kingdom.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=62}} Even after Isis was firmly established as Horus's mother, Hathor continued to appear in this role, especially when nursing the pharaoh. Images of the Hathor-cow with a child in a papyrus thicket represented her mythological upbringing in a secluded marsh. Goddesses' milk was a sign of divinity and royal status. Thus, images in which Hathor nurses the pharaoh represent his right to rule.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=175\u2013176}} Hathor's relationship with Horus gave a healing aspect to her character, as she was said to have restored Horus's missing eye or eyes after Set attacked him.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=140}} In the version of this episode in \"The Contendings of Horus and Set\", Hathor finds Horus with his eyes torn out and heals the wounds with gazelle's milk.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nBeginning in the [[Late Period of Egypt|Late Period]] (664\u2013323 BC), temples focused on the worship of a divine family: an adult male deity, his wife, and their immature son. Satellite buildings, known as [[mammisis]], were built in celebration of the birth of the local child deity. The child god represented the cyclical renewal of the cosmos and an archetypal heir to the kingship.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Hathor was the mother in many of these local triads of gods. At Dendera, the mature Horus of Edfu was the father and Hathor the mother, while their child was [[Ihy]], a god whose name meant \"sistrum-player\" and who personified the jubilation associated with the instrument.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=132\u2013133}} At [[Kom Ombo]], Hathor's local form, Tasenetnofret, was mother to Horus's son Panebtawy.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=123, 168}} Other children of Hathor included a minor deity from the town of Hu, named Neferhotep,{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=132\u2013133}} and several child forms of Horus.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=71}}\n\nThe milky sap of the [[ficus sycomorus|sycamore tree]], which the Egyptians regarded as a symbol of life, became one of her symbols.{{sfn|Roberts|2000|pp=26\u201327}} The milk was equated with water of the Nile inundation and thus fertility.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=179\u2013182}} In the late Ptolemaic and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Periods]], many temples contained a creation myth that adapted long-standing ideas about creation.{{sfn|McClain|2011|pp=3\u20136}} The version from Hathor's temple at Dendera emphasizes that she, as a female solar deity, was the first being to emerge from the primordial waters that preceded creation, and her life-giving light and milk nourished all living things.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=169\u2013172, 185}}\n\nLike [[Meskhenet]], another goddess who presided over birth, Hathor was connected with ''[[shai]]'', the Egyptian concept of [[fate]], particularly when she took the form of the Seven Hathors. In two New Kingdom works of fiction, \"[[The Tale of Two Brothers]]\" and \"[[The Tale of the Doomed Prince]]\", the Hathors appear at the births of major characters and foretell the manner of their deaths.{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2001|pp=507\u2013508}}\n\nHathor's maternal aspects can be compared with those of Isis and Mut, yet there are many contrasts between them. Isis's devotion to her husband and care for their child represented a more socially acceptable form of love than Hathor's uninhibited sexuality,{{sfn|Griffiths|2001|p=189}} and Mut's character was more authoritative than sexual.{{sfn|te Velde|2001|p=455}} The text of the first century AD [[Papyrus Insinger]] likens a faithful wife, the mistress of a household, to Mut, while comparing Hathor to a strange woman who tempts a married man.{{sfn|te Velde|2001|p=455}}\n\n===Foreign lands and goods===\nEgypt maintained trade relations with the coastal cities of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Canaan]], particularly [[Byblos]], placing Egyptian religion in contact with the [[ancient Canaanite religion|religions of that region]].{{sfn|Hollis|2009|p=2}} At some point, perhaps as early as the Old Kingdom, the Egyptians began to refer to the patron goddess of Byblos, [[Baalat Gebal]], as a local form of Hathor.{{sfn|Espinel|2002|pp=117\u2013119}} So strong was Hathor's link to Byblos that texts from Dendera say she resided there.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=139}} The Egyptians sometimes equated [[Anat]], an aggressive Canaanite goddess who came to be worshipped in Egypt during the New Kingdom, with Hathor.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=137}} Some Canaanite artworks depict a nude goddess with a curling wig taken from Hathor's iconography.{{sfn|Cornelius|2004|p=45}} Which goddess these images represent is not known, but the Egyptians adopted her iconography and came to regard her as an independent deity, [[Qetesh]],{{sfn|Cornelius|2004|pp=96\u201397}} whom they associated with Hathor.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=132}}\n\nHathor's solar character may have played a role in linking her with trade: she was believed to protect ships on the Nile and in the seas beyond Egypt, as she protected the barque of Ra in the sky.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=72\u201374}} The mythological wandering of the Eye goddess in Nubia or Libya gave her a connection with those lands as well.{{sfn|Darnell|1995|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nHathor was closely connected with the [[Sinai Peninsula]],{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} which was not considered part of Egypt proper but was the site of Egyptian mines for copper, [[turquoise]], and [[malachite]] during the Middle and New Kingdoms.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=52}} One of Hathor's epithets, \"Lady of ''Mefkat''\", may have referred specifically to turquoise or to all blue-green minerals. She was also called \"Lady of [[Egyptian faience|Faience]]\", a blue-green ceramic that Egyptians likened to turquoise.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=143}} Hathor was also worshipped at various quarries and mining sites in Egypt's [[Eastern Desert]], such as the [[amethyst]] mines of Wadi el-Hudi, where she was sometimes called \"Lady of Amethyst\".{{sfn|Espinel|2005|pp=61, 65\u201366}}\n\nSouth of Egypt, Hathor's influence was thought to have extended over the [[land of Punt]], which lay along the Red Sea coast and was a major source for the incense with which Hathor was linked, as well as with Nubia, northwest of Punt.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=72\u201374}} The [[autobiography of Harkhuf]], an official in the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (c. 2345\u20132181 BC), describes his expedition to a land in or near Nubia, from which he brought back great quantities of [[ebony]], panther skins, and incense for the king. The text describes these exotic goods as Hathor's gift to the pharaoh.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} Egyptian expeditions to mine gold in Nubia introduced her cult to the region during the Middle and New Kingdoms,{{sfn|Yellin|2012|pp=125\u2013128}} and New Kingdom pharaohs built several temples to her in the portions of Nubia that they ruled.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=227\u2013230}}\n\n===Afterlife===\n[[Image:BD Hathor Mistress of the West.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a cow whose head protrudes from a hill, in front of which stand papyrus stalks and a pyramidal chapel|Hathor, in bovine form, emerges from a hill representing the [[Theban necropolis]], in a copy of the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' from the 13th century BC]]\nHathor was one of several goddesses believed to assist deceased souls in the [[ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|afterlife]].{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=153}} One of these was [[Imentet]], the goddess of the west, who personified the [[necropolises]], or clusters of tombs, on the west bank of the Nile, and the realm of the afterlife itself. She was often regarded as a specialized manifestation of Hathor.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nJust as she crossed the boundary between Egypt and foreign lands, Hathor passed through the boundary between the living and the [[Duat]], the realm of the dead.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|p=166}} She helped the spirits of deceased humans enter the Duat and was closely linked with tomb sites, where that transition began.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=88, 164}} The [[Theban necropolis]], for example, was often portrayed as a stylized mountain with the cow of Hathor emerging from it.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=179\u2013180}} Her role as a sky goddess was also linked to the afterlife. Because the sky goddess\u2014either Nut or Hathor\u2014assisted Ra in his daily rebirth, she had an important part in [[Egyptian afterlife beliefs]], according to which deceased humans were reborn like the sun god.{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=82}} Coffins, tombs, and the underworld itself were interpreted as the womb of this goddess, from which the deceased soul would be reborn.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=170\u2013173}}{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=39\u201340, 110}}\n\nNut, Hathor, and Imentet could each, in different texts, lead the deceased into a place where they would receive food and drink for eternal sustenance. Thus, Hathor, as Imentet, often appears on tombs, welcoming the deceased person as her child into a blissful afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|pp=152\u2013154, 170\u2013173}} In New Kingdom funerary texts and artwork, the afterlife was often illustrated as a pleasant, fertile garden, over which Hathor sometimes presided.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=42\u201343}} The welcoming afterlife goddess was often portrayed as a goddess in the form of a tree, giving water to the deceased. Nut most commonly filled this role, but the tree goddess was sometimes called Hathor instead.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nThe afterlife also had a sexual aspect. In the Osiris myth, the murdered god [[Osiris]] was resurrected when he copulated with Isis and conceived Horus. In solar ideology, Ra's union with the sky goddess allowed his own rebirth. Sex therefore enabled the rebirth of the deceased, and goddesses like Isis and Hathor served to rouse the deceased to new life. But they merely stimulated the male deities' regenerative powers, rather than playing the central role.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013229}}\n\nAncient Egyptians prefixed the names of the deceased with Osiris's name to connect them with his resurrection. For example, a woman named [[Henutmehyt]] would be dubbed \"Osiris-Henutmehyt\". Over time they increasingly associated the deceased with both male and female divine powers.{{sfn|Cooney|2010|pp=227\u2013229, 235\u2013236}} As early as the late Old Kingdom, women were sometimes said to join the worshippers of Hathor in the afterlife, just as men joined the following of Osiris. In the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] (c. 1070\u2013664 BC), Egyptians began to add Hathor's name to that of deceased women in place of that of Osiris. In some cases, women were called \"Osiris-Hathor\", indicating that they benefited from the revivifying power of both deities. In these late periods, Hathor was sometimes said to rule the afterlife as Osiris did.{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=251\u2013254}}\n\n==Iconography==\nHathor was often depicted as a cow bearing the sun disk between her horns, especially when shown nursing the king. She could also appear as a woman with the head of a cow. Her most common form, however, was a woman wearing a headdress of the horns and sun disk, often with a red or turquoise sheath dress, or a dress combining both colors. Sometimes the horns stood atop a low [[modius (headdress)|modius]] or the vulture headdress that Egyptian queens often wore in the New Kingdom. Because Isis adopted the same headdress during the New Kingdom, the two goddesses can be distinguished only if labeled in writing. When in the role of Imentet, Hathor wore the [[emblem of the west]] upon her head instead of the horned headdress.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=143\u2013144, 148}} The Seven Hathors were sometimes portrayed as a set of seven cows, accompanied by a minor sky and afterlife deity called the Bull of the West.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=77, 175}}\n\nSome animals other than cattle could represent Hathor. The uraeus was a common motif in Egyptian art and could represent a variety of goddesses who were identified with the Eye of Ra.{{sfn|Pinch|2004|pp=198\u2013199}} When Hathor was depicted as a uraeus, it represented the ferocious and protective aspects of her character. She also appeared as a lioness, and this form had a similar meaning.{{sfn|Roberts|1997|pp=8\u201310}} In contrast, the [[domestic cat]], which was sometimes connected with Hathor, often represented the Eye goddess's pacified form.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=190\u2013197}} When portrayed as a sycamore tree, Hathor was usually shown with the upper body of her human form emerging from the trunk.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\nLike other goddesses, Hathor might carry a stalk of papyrus as a staff, though she could instead hold a ''[[Was-sceptre|was]]'' staff, a symbol of power that was usually restricted to male deities.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=143}} The only goddesses who used the ''was'' were those, like Hathor, who were linked with the Eye of Ra.{{sfn|Graham|2001|p=166}} She also commonly carried a sistrum or a ''menat'' necklace. The sistrum came in two varieties: a simple loop shape or the more complex ''naos'' sistrum, which was shaped to resemble a ''[[Cella#Egyptian temples|naos]]'' shrine and flanked by [[volute]]s resembling the antennae of the Bat emblem.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=153\u2013159}} The ''[[menat]]'' necklace, made up of many strands of beads, was shaken in ceremonies in Hathor's honor, similarly to the sistrum.{{sfn|Hart|2005|p=65}} Images of it were sometimes seen as personifications of Hathor herself.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|p=278}} Mirrors were another of her symbols, because in Egypt they were often made of gold or bronze and therefore symbolized the sun disk, and because they were connected with beauty and femininity. Some mirror handles were made in the shape of Hathor's face.{{sfn|Wilkinson|1993|pp=32, 83}}\n\nHathor was sometimes represented as a human face with bovine ears, seen from the front rather than in the profile-based perspective that was typical of Egyptian art. When she appears in this form, the tresses on either side of her face often curl into loops. This mask-like face was placed on the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of columns beginning in the late Old Kingdom. Columns of this style were used in many temples to Hathor and other goddesses.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=135\u2013139}} These columns have two or four faces, which may represent the duality between different aspects of the goddess or the watchfulness of Hathor of the Four Faces. The designs of Hathoric columns have a complex relationship with those of sistra. Both styles of sistrum can bear the Hathor mask on the handle, and Hathoric columns often incorporate the ''naos'' sistrum shape above the goddess's head.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=153\u2013159}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:Hathor Amulet MET DP136527.jpg|alt=Refer to caption|Amulet of Hathor as a [[uraeus]] wearing a ''naos'' headdress, early to mid-first millennium BC\nFile:Hathor's head.

Hathor was one of the few deities to receive such donations.{{sfn|Goedicke|1978|pp=118\u2013123}} Late Old Kingdom rulers especially promoted the cult of Hathor in the provinces, as a way of binding those regions to the royal court. She may have absorbed the traits of contemporary provincial goddesses.{{sfn|Morris|2011|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nMany female royals, though not reigning queens, held positions in the cult during the Old Kingdom.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=222\u2013226, 231}} [[Mentuhotep II]], who became the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom despite having no relation to the Old Kingdom rulers, sought to legitimize his rule by portraying himself as Hathor's son. The first images of the Hathor-cow suckling the king date to his reign, and several priestesses of Hathor were depicted as though they were his wives, although he may not have actually married them.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=231}}{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=135\u2013136}} In the course of the Middle Kingdom, queens were increasingly seen as directly embodying the goddess, just as the king embodied Ra.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=234}} The emphasis on the queen as Hathor continued through the New Kingdom. Queens were portrayed with the headdress of Hathor beginning in the late Eighteenth Dynasty. An image of the [[sed festival]] of [[Amenhotep III]], meant to celebrate and renew his rule, shows the king together with Hathor and his queen [[Tiye]], which could mean that the king symbolically married the goddess in the course of the festival.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\n[[Hatshepsut]], a woman who ruled as a pharaoh in the early New Kingdom, emphasized her relationship to Hathor in a different way.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=105\u2013107}} She used [[ancient Egyptian royal titulary|names and titles]] that linked her to a variety of goddesses, including Hathor, so as to legitimize her rule in what was normally a male position.{{sfn|Robins|1999|pp=107\u2013112}} She built several temples to Hathor and placed her own [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut|mortuary temple]], which incorporated a chapel dedicated to the goddess, at [[Deir el-Bahari]], which had been a cult site of Hathor since the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=105\u2013107}}\n\nThe preeminence of Amun during the New Kingdom gave greater visibility to his consort Mut, and in the course of the period, Isis began appearing in roles that traditionally belonged to Hathor alone, such as that of the goddess in the solar barque. Despite the growing prominence of these deities, Hathor remained important, particularly in relation to fertility, sexuality, and queenship, throughout the New Kingdom.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=119\u2013120, 178\u2013179}}\n\nAfter the New Kingdom, Isis increasingly overshadowed Hathor and other goddesses as she took on their characteristics.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=129}} In the [[Ptolemaic period]] (305\u201330 BC), when [[Greeks]] governed Egypt and [[Ancient Greek religion|their religion]] developed a complex relationship with that of Egypt, the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] adopted and modified the Egyptian ideology of kingship. Beginning with [[Arsinoe II]], wife of [[Ptolemy II]], the Ptolemies closely linked their queens with Isis and with several Greek goddesses, particularly their own goddess of love and sexuality, [[Aphrodite]].{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=312, 339}} Nevertheless, when the Greeks referred to Egyptian gods by the names of their own gods (a practice called ''[[interpretatio Graeca]]''), they sometimes called Hathor Aphrodite.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=141}} Traits of Isis, Hathor, and Aphrodite were all combined to justify the treatment of Ptolemaic queens as goddesses. Thus, the poet [[Callimachus]] alluded to the myth of Hathor's lost lock of hair when praising [[Berenice II]] for sacrificing her own hair to Aphrodite,{{sfn|Selden|1998|pp=346\u2013348}} and iconographic traits that Isis and Hathor shared, such as the bovine horns and vulture headdress, appeared on images portraying Ptolemaic queens as Aphrodite.{{sfn|Cheshire|2007|pp=157\u2013163}}\n\n===Temples in Egypt===\n[[File:Dendera hypostyle hall crosswise.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Room with tall stone columns topped by faces of women.

During the New Kingdom era, the temple of Hathor of the Southern Sycomore was her main temple in Memphis.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=219\u2013221}} At that site she was described as the daughter of the city's main deity, [[Ptah]].{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=82}} The cult of Ra and Atum at Heliopolis, northeast of Memphis, included a temple to Hathor-Nebethetepet that was probably built in the Middle Kingdom. A willow and a sycomore tree stood near the sanctuary and may have been worshipped as manifestations of the goddess.{{sfn|Quirke|2001|pp=102\u2013105}} A few cities farther north in the [[Nile Delta]], such as [[Yamu]] and [[Terenuthis]], also had temples to her.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=108, 111}}\n\nAs the rulers of the Old Kingdom made an effort to develop towns in Upper and [[Middle Egypt]], several cult centers of Hathor were founded across the region, at sites such as [[Cusae]], [[Akhmim]], and [[Naga ed-Der]].{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=226, 229}} In the [[First Intermediate Period]] (c. 2181\u20132055) her cult statue from Dendera was periodically carried to the Theban necropolis. During the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, Mentuhotep II established a permanent cult center for her in the necropolis at Deir el-Bahari.{{sfn|Goedicke|1991|pp=245, 252}} The nearby village of [[Deir el-Medina]], home to the tomb workers of the necropolis during the New Kingdom, also contained temples of Hathor. One continued to function and was periodically rebuilt as late as the Ptolemaic Period, centuries after the village was abandoned.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nDendera, Hathor's oldest temple in Upper Egypt, dates to at least to the Fourth Dynasty.{{sfn|Gillam|1995|p=227}} After the end of the Old Kingdom it surpassed her Memphite temples in importance.{{sfn|Vischak|2001|p=83}} Many kings made additions to the temple complex through Egyptian history. The last version of the temple was built in the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods and is today one of the best-preserved Egyptian temples from that time.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=149\u2013151}}\n\nIn the Old Kingdom, most priests of Hathor, including the highest ranks, were women. Many of these women were members of the royal family.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=240\u2013241}} In the course of the Middle Kingdom, women were increasingly excluded from the highest priestly positions, at the same time that queens were becoming more closely tied to Hathor's cult. Thus, non-royal women disappeared from the high ranks of Hathor's priesthood,{{sfn|Gillam|1995|pp=233\u2013234}} although women continued to serve as musicians and singers in temple cults across Egypt.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=243\u2013244}}\n\nThe most frequent temple rite for any deity was the daily offering ritual, in which the cult image, or statue, of a deity would be clothed and given food.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=328}} The daily ritual was largely the same in every Egyptian temple,{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=328}} although the goods given as offerings could vary according to which deity received them.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126\u2013128}} Wine and beer were common offerings in all temples, but especially in rituals in Hathor's honor,{{sfn|Poo|2010|pp=2\u20133}} and she and the goddesses related to her often received sistra and ''menat'' necklaces.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126\u2013128}} In Late and Ptolemaic times, they were also offered a pair of mirrors, representing the sun and the moon.{{sfn|Derriks|2001|pp=421\u2013422}}\n\n===Festivals===\nMany of Hathor's annual festivals were celebrated with drinking and dancing that served a ritual purpose. Revelers at these festivals may have aimed to reach a state of [[religious ecstasy]], which was otherwise rare or nonexistent in ancient Egyptian religion. Graves-Brown suggests that celebrants in Hathor's festivals aimed to reach an [[altered state of consciousness]] to allow them interact with the divine realm.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=166\u2013169}} An example is the Festival of Drunkenness, commemorating the return of the Eye of Ra, which was celebrated on the twentieth day of the [[Thout|month of Thout]] at temples to Hathor and to other Eye goddesses. It was celebrated as early as the Middle Kingdom, but it is best known from Ptolemaic and Roman times.{{sfn|Graves-Brown|2010|pp=166\u2013169}} The dancing, eating and drinking that took place during the Festival of Drunkenness represented the opposite of the sorrow, hunger, and thirst that the Egyptians associated with death. Whereas the rampages of the Eye of Ra brought death to humans, the Festival of Drunkenness celebrated life, abundance, and joy.{{sfn|Frandsen|1999|pp=131, 142\u2013143}}\n\nIn a local Theban festival known as the [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley]], which began to be celebrated in the Middle Kingdom, the cult image of Amun from the [[Precinct of Amun-Re|Temple of Karnak]] visited the temples in the Theban Necropolis while members of the community went to the tombs of their deceased relatives to drink, eat, and celebrate.{{sfn|Teeter|2011|pp=67\u201368}} Hathor was not involved in this festival until the early New Kingdom,{{sfn|Sadek|1988|p=49}} after which Amun's overnight stay in the temples at Deir el-Bahari came to be seen as his sexual union with her.{{sfn|Teeter|2011|p=70}}\n\nSeveral temples in Ptolemaic times, including that of Dendera, observed the Egyptian new year with a series of ceremonies in which images of the temple deity were supposed to be revitalized by contact with the sun god. On the days leading up to the new year, Dendera's statue of Hathor was taken to the ''[[wabet]]'', a specialized room in the temple, and placed under a ceiling decorated with images of the sky and sun. On the first day of the new year, the first day of the [[Thoth (month)|month of Thoth]], the Hathor image was carried up to the roof to be bathed in genuine sunlight.{{sfn|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=193\u2013198}}\n\nThe best-documented festival focused on Hathor is another Ptolemaic celebration, the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion. It took place over fourteen days in the month of [[Epiphi]].{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=93}}{{sfn|Richter|2016|p=4}} Hathor's cult image from Dendera was carried by boat to several temple sites to visit the gods of those temples. The endpoint of the journey was the Temple of Horus at [[Edfu]], where the Hathor statue from Dendera met that of Horus of Edfu and the two were placed together.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|p=94}} On one day of the festival, these images were carried out to a shrine where primordial deities such as the sun god and the [[Ennead]] were said to be buried. The texts say the divine couple performed offering rites for these entombed gods.{{sfn|Verner|2013|pp=437\u2013439}} Many Egyptologists regard this festival as a [[hieros gamos|ritual marriage]] between Horus and Hathor, although Martin Stadler challenges this view, arguing that it instead represented the rejuvenation of the buried creator gods.{{sfn|Stadler|2008|pp=4\u20136}} C.

Bleeker thought the Beautiful Reunion was another celebration of the return of the Distant Goddess, citing allusions in the temple's festival texts to the myth of the solar eye.{{sfn|Bleeker|1973|pp=98\u2013101}} Barbara Richter argues that the festival represented all three things at once. She points out that the birth of Horus and Hathor's son Ihy was celebrated at Dendera nine months after the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion, implying that Hathor's visit to Horus represented Ihy's conception.{{sfn|Richter|2016|pp=4, 202\u2013205}}\n\nThe third month of the [[Egyptian calendar]], [[Hathor (month)|Hathor or Athyr]], was named for the goddess. Festivities in her honor took place throughout the month, although they are not recorded in the texts from Dendera.{{sfn|Verner|2013|p=43}}\n\n===Worship outside Egypt===\n[[File:Temple of Hathor in Timna Park in summer 2011 (1).JPG|thumb|upright|right|alt=Foundations of a small stone wall at the base of a desert cliff|Remains of the Hathor shrine in the [[Timna Valley]]]]\nEgyptian kings as early as the Old Kingdom donated goods to the temple of Baalat Gebal in Byblos, using the syncretism of Baalat with Hathor to cement their close trading relationship with Byblos.{{sfn|Espinel|2002|pp=116\u2013118}} A temple to Hathor as Lady of Byblos was built during the reign of [[Thutmose III]], although it may simply have been a shrine within the temple of Baalat.{{sfn|Traunecker|2001|p=110}} After the breakdown of the New Kingdom, Hathor's prominence in Byblos diminished along with Egypt's trade links to the city. A few artifacts from the early first millennium BC suggest that the Egyptians began equating Baalat with Isis at that time.{{sfn|Zernecke|2013|pp=227\u2013230}} A myth about Isis's presence in Byblos, related by the Greek author [[Plutarch]] in his work ''On Isis and Osiris'' in the 2nd century AD, suggests that by his time Isis had entirely supplanted Hathor in the city.{{sfn|Hollis|2009|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nEgyptians in the Sinai built a few temples in the region. The largest was a complex dedicated primarily to Hathor as patroness of mining at [[Serabit el-Khadim]], on the west side of the peninsula.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=238\u2013239}} It was occupied from the middle of the Middle Kingdom to near the end of the New.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=55\u201357}} The [[Timna Valley]], on the fringes of the Egyptian empire on the east side of the peninsula, was the site of seasonal mining expeditions during the New Kingdom. It included a shrine to Hathor that was probably deserted during the off-season. The local [[Midianites]], whom the Egyptians used as part of the mining workforce, may have given offerings to Hathor as their overseers did. After the Egyptians abandoned the site in the Twentieth Dynasty, however, the Midianites converted the shrine to a tent shrine devoted to their own deities.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=59\u201369}}\n\nIn contrast, the Nubians in the south fully incorporated Hathor into their religion. During the New Kingdom, when most of Nubia was under Egyptian control, pharaohs dedicated several temples in Nubia to Hathor, such as those at [[Faras]] and [[Mirgissa]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=227\u2013230}} Amenhotep III and [[Ramesses II]] both built temples in Nubia that celebrated their respective queens as manifestations of female deities, including Hathor: Amenhotep's wife Tiye at [[Sedeinga]]{{sfn|Morkot|2012|pp=325\u2013326}} and Ramesses's wife [[Nefertari]] at the [[Abu Simbel temples#Small Temple|Small Temple of Abu Simbel]].{{sfn|Fisher|2012|pp=357\u2013358}} The independent Kingdom of Kush, which emerged in Nubia after the collapse of the New Kingdom, based its beliefs about [[List of monarchs of Kush|Kushite kings]] on the royal ideology of Egypt. Therefore, Hathor, Isis, Mut, and Nut were all seen as the mythological mother of each Kushite king and equated with his female relatives, such as the ''[[kandake]]'', the Kushite queen or [[queen mother]], who had prominent roles in Kushite religion.{{sfn|Kendall|2010b}} At [[Jebel Barkal]], a site sacred to Amun, the Kushite king [[Taharqa]] built a pair of temples, one dedicated to Hathor and [[Temple of Mut, Jebel Barkal|one to Mut]] as consorts of Amun, replacing New Kingdom Egyptian temples that may have been dedicated to these same goddesses.{{sfn|Kendall|2010a|pp=1, 12}} But Isis was the most prominent of the Egyptian goddesses worshipped in Nubia, and her status there increased over time. Thus, in the Meroitic period of Nubian history (c. 300 BC \u2013 AD 400), Hathor appeared in temples mainly as a companion to Isis.{{sfn|Yellin|2012|pp=128, 133}}\n\n===Popular worship===\n[[File:Plaque of a woman giving birth assisted by Hathor.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Plaque showing a woman squatting while cow-headed women stand at either side|Ptolemaic plaque of a woman giving birth assisted by two figures of Hathor, fourth to first century BC]]\nIn addition to formal and public rituals at temples, Egyptians privately worshipped deities for personal reasons, including at their homes. Birth was hazardous for both mother and child in ancient Egypt, yet children were much desired. Thus fertility and safe childbirth are among the most prominent concerns in their popular religion, and fertility deities such as Hathor and [[Taweret]] were commonly worshipped in household shrines. Egyptian women squatted on bricks while giving birth, and the only known surviving birth brick from ancient Egypt is decorated with an image of a woman holding her child flanked by images of Hathor.{{sfn|Ritner|2008|pp=173\u2013175, 181}} In Roman times, [[terracotta]] figurines, sometimes found in a domestic context, depicted a woman with an elaborate headdress exposing her genitals, as Hathor did to cheer up Ra.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=218\u2013219}} The meaning of these figurines is not known,{{sfn|Sandri|2012|pp=637\u2013638}} but they are often thought to represent Hathor or Isis combined with Aphrodite making a gesture that represented fertility or protection against evil.{{sfn|Morris|2007|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nHathor was one of a handful of deities, including Amun, Ptah, and Thoth, who were commonly prayed to for help with personal problems.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=349\u2013351}} Many Egyptians left offerings at temples or small shrines dedicated to the gods they prayed to. Most offerings to Hathor were used for their symbolism, not for their intrinsic value. Cloths painted with images of Hathor were common, as were plaques and figurines depicting her animal forms. Different types of offerings may have symbolized different goals on the part of the donor, but their meaning is usually unknown. Images of Hathor alluded to her mythical roles, like depictions of the maternal cow in the marsh.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=119, 347, 354\u2013355}} Offerings of sistra may have been meant to appease the goddess's dangerous aspects and bring out her positive ones,{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=157\u2013158}} while [[phalli]] represented a prayer for fertility, as shown by an inscription found on one example.{{sfn|Lesko|2008|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\nSome Egyptians also left written prayers to Hathor, inscribed on [[stela]]e or written as graffiti.{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=349\u2013351}} Prayers to some deities, such as Amun, show that they were thought to punish wrongdoers and heal people who repented for their misbehavior. In contrast, prayers to Hathor mention only the benefits she could grant, such as abundant food during life and a well-provisioned burial after death.{{sfn|Sadek|1988|pp=89, 114\u2013115}}\n\n===Funerary practices===\n[[File:Nuovo regno, la dea hathor accoglie seth I, dalla valle dei re, 1294-1279 ac ca..JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Relief of Hathor holding a man's hand and lifting her menat necklace for him to grasp|Hathor welcoming [[Seti I]] into the afterlife, 13th century BC]]\nAs an afterlife deity, Hathor appeared frequently in funerary texts and art. In the early New Kingdom, for instance, Osiris, [[Anubis]], and Hathor were the three deities most commonly found in royal tomb decoration.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|p=110}} In that period she often appeared as the goddess welcoming the dead into the afterlife.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=171}} Other images referred to her more obliquely. Reliefs in Old Kingdom tombs show men and women performing a ritual called \"shaking the papyrus\". The significance of this rite is not known, but inscriptions sometimes say it was performed \"for Hathor\", and shaking papyrus stalks produces a rustling sound that may have been likened to the rattling of a sistrum.{{sfn|Woods|2011|pp=314\u2013316}} Other Hathoric imagery in tombs included the cow emerging from the mountain of the necropolis{{sfn|Pinch|1993|pp=179\u2013180}} and the seated figure of the goddess presiding over a garden in the afterlife.{{sfn|Billing|2004|pp=42\u201343}} Images of Nut were often painted or incised inside coffins, indicating that the coffin was her womb, from which the occupant would be reborn in the afterlife. In the Third Intermediate Period, Hathor began to be placed on the floor of the coffin, with Nut on the interior of the lid.{{sfn|Lesko|1999|pp=39\u201340, 110}}\n\nTomb art from the Eighteenth Dynasty often shows people drinking, dancing, and playing music, as well as holding ''menat'' necklaces and sistra\u2014all imagery that alluded to Hathor. These images may represent private feasts that were celebrated in front of tombs to commemorate the people buried there, or they may show gatherings at temple festivals such as the Beautiful Festival of the Valley.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013136, 144\u2013147}} Festivals were thought to allow contact between the human and divine realms, and by extension, between the living and the dead. Thus, texts from tombs often expressed a wish that the deceased would be able to participate in festivals, primarily those dedicated to Osiris.{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=225}} Tombs' festival imagery, however, may refer to festivals involving Hathor, such as the Festival of Drunkenness, or to the private feasts, which were also closely connected with her. Drinking and dancing at these feasts may have been meant to intoxicate the celebrants, as at the Festival of Drunkenness, allowing them to commune with the spirits of the deceased.{{sfn|Harrington|2016|pp=132\u2013136, 144\u2013147}}\n\nHathor was said to supply offerings to deceased people as early as the Old Kingdom, and spells to enable both men and women to join her retinue in the afterlife appeared as early as the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'' in the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=251\u2013254}} Some burial goods that portray deceased women as goddesses may depict these women as followers of Hathor, although whether the imagery refers to Hathor or Isis is not known. The link between Hathor and deceased women was maintained into the Roman Period, the last stage of ancient Egyptian religion before its [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|extinction]].{{sfn|Smith|2017|pp=384\u2013389}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Au\u00f0umbla]], a primeval cow in Norse mythology\n* [[List of solar deities]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book | last=Assmann | first=Jan |authorlink=Jan Assmann |others= Translated by David Lorton | title=Death and Salvation in Ancient Egypt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rL2y0T6ukuYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | publisher= Cornell University Press | year =2005 |origyear= German edition 2001 | isbn = 978-0801442414 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite journal |author-last=Billing |author-first=Nils |title=Writing an Image: The Formulation of the Tree Goddess Motif in the Book of the Dead, Ch. 59 |journal=Studien zur Alt\u00e4gyptischen Kultur |volume=32 |pages=35\u201350 |date=2004 |jstor=25152905 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bleeker |first=C.

Throughout the competition she continued to impress with her vocals in songs like [[Flashdance... What a Feeling]], [[I'm So Excited]], [[Young Hearts Run Free]] and [[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]].

Agnes recalls when his name first came up for the album ''\u201c''They said maybe you should just meet first and see if you like each other, as opposed to just working together.\u201d They got on \u2013 so well that Hansson ended up producing an album that helped Agnes realise her vision, Dance Love and Pop together in one album<ref name=\"ac.se\" /> \u201cA lot of things changed for me when I started to work with this album.

The first song she ever sang on Swedish television was \"Varje g\u00e5ng jag ser dig\" ''(Each time I see you)'', a soul ballad with a strong love lyrics. Throughout the competition she continued to impress with her vocals in songs like [[Flashdance... What a Feeling]], [[I'm So Excited]], [[Young Hearts Run Free]] and [[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]. Already in this early stage of her career she cited legendary soul-singer [[Stevie Wonder]] as her inspiration.<ref name=\"ac.nu\" /> Both her self-titled debut album and her second album consisted strongly of R&B, soul, and pop songs, continuing the path she began during her time in \"Idol\".\n\nBut after leaving Sony Music and signing on to Roxy, she geared towards the dance and club genre, she was introduced to the songwriter and producer Anders Hansson. Agnes recalls when his name first came up for the album ''\u201c''They said maybe you should just meet first and see if you like each other, as opposed to just working together.\u201d They got on \u2013 so well that Hansson ended up producing an album that helped Agnes realise her vision, Dance Love and Pop together in one album<ref name=\"ac.se\" /> \u201cA lot of things changed for me when I started to work with this album. I really liked it, because I knew that I wanted to do something totally different to the two others. I wanted to do uptempo, disco-orientated songs and I really wanted to work with Anders because he felt the same way.\"<ref name=\"ac.se\" /> When released the first single \"On and On\" from her third album, it immediately showed a clear change of artistic direction for her music. This was clearly observed by the critics who all homaged her new musical style. Other remarks are ''\"The album fits the dance floor at any club.

Remains of settlements are still present on the wood-covered hills to the southwest of town.\n\nAround the 1st century BC, the territory became subject to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The town center was situated on the nearby hills, but it was then moved to its current location by order of [[Julius Caesar]], who had the swamp near the southern tip of the lake drained and laid the plan of the walled city in the typical Roman grid of perpendicular streets. The newly founded town was named ''Novum Comum'' and had the status of ''municipium''. In September 2018, [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Culture Minister]] [[Alberto Bonisoli]] announced the discovery of around several hundred [[gold coin]]s in the basement of the former [[Cressoni Theater]] (Teatro Cressoni) in a two-handled [[soapstone]] [[amphora]], coins struck by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], [[Valentinian III]], [[Leo I the Thracian|Leon I]], [[Antonio]] and [[Libius Severus]] dating to 474AD.<ref name=\"2018-09-10_NPR\">[https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/646445359/hundreds-of-roman-gold-coins-found-in-theater-basement Hundreds Of Roman Gold Coins Found In Theater Basement], Shannon Van Sant, [[NPR]], 2018-09-10</ref>\n\nIn 774, the town surrendered to invading [[Carolingian Empire|Franks]] led by [[Charlemagne]], and became a center of commercial exchange.\n\nIn 1127, Como lost a decade-long war with the nearby town of [[Milan]]. A few decades later, with the help of [[Frederick Barbarossa]], the Comaschi were able to avenge their defeat when Milan was destroyed in 1162. Frederick promoted the construction of several defensive towers around the city limits, of which only one, [[Castello Baradello|the Baradello]], remains.\n\nSubsequently, the history of Como followed that of the [[Duchy of Milan]], through the French invasion and the Spanish domination, until 1714, when the territory was taken by the Austrians. [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] descended into Lombardy in 1796 and ruled it until 1815, when the Austrian rule was resumed after the [[Congress of Vienna]].

Remains of settlements are still present on the wood-covered hills to the southwest of town.\n\nAround the 1st century BC, the territory became subject to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The town center was situated on the nearby hills, but it was then moved to its current location by order of [[Julius Caesar]], who had the swamp near the southern tip of the lake drained and laid the plan of the walled city in the typical Roman grid of perpendicular streets. The newly founded town was named ''Novum Comum'' and had the status of ''municipium''. In September 2018, [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Culture Minister]] [[Alberto Bonisoli]] announced the discovery of around several hundred [[gold coin]]s in the basement of the former [[Cressoni Theater]] (Teatro Cressoni) in a two-handled [[soapstone]] [[amphora]], coins struck by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], [[Valentinian III]], [[Leo I the Thracian|Leon I]], [[Antonio]] and [[Libius Severus]] dating to 474AD.<ref name=\"2018-09-10_NPR\">[https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/646445359/hundreds-of-roman-gold-coins-found-in-theater-basement Hundreds Of Roman Gold Coins Found In Theater Basement], Shannon Van Sant, [[NPR]], 2018-09-10</ref>\n\nIn 774, the town surrendered to invading [[Carolingian Empire|Franks]] led by [[Charlemagne]], and became a center of commercial exchange.\n\nIn 1127, Como lost a decade-long war with the nearby town of [[Milan]]. A few decades later, with the help of [[Frederick Barbarossa]], the Comaschi were able to avenge their defeat when Milan was destroyed in 1162. Frederick promoted the construction of several defensive towers around the city limits, of which only one, [[Castello Baradello|the Baradello]], remains.\n\nSubsequently, the history of Como followed that of the [[Duchy of Milan]], through the French invasion and the Spanish domination, until 1714, when the territory was taken by the Austrians. [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] descended into Lombardy in 1796 and ruled it until 1815, when the Austrian rule was resumed after the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Finally in 1859, with the arrival of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], the town was freed from the Austrians and it became part of the newly formed [[Italian unification|Kingdom of Italy]] under the [[House of Savoy]].\n\nAt the end of World War II, after passing through Como on his escape towards Switzerland, [[Benito Mussolini]] was taken prisoner and then shot by partisans in [[Giulino di Mezzegra]], a small town on the north shores of [[Lake Como]].\n\nIn 2010, a motion by members of the nationalist [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP) was submitted to the Swiss parliament requesting the [[territorial evolution of Switzerland|admission of adjacent territories]] to the [[Swiss Confederation]]; Como (and its province) is one of these.<ref name=\"Figaro 22 June 2010\">{{cite news|last=Maurisse|first=Marie|title=Quand un d\u00e9put\u00e9 suisse r\u00eave d'annexer la Savoie|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2010/06/21/01003-20100621ARTFIG00751-quand-un-depute-suisse-reve-d-annexer-la-savoie.php|accessdate=22 June 2010|newspaper=[[Le Figaro]]|date=22 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Standard 21 June 2010\">{{cite news|title=SVP-Forderung: Vorarlberg soll Kanton werden|url=http://derstandard.at/1276413676440/SVP-Forderung-Vorarlberg-soll-Kanton-werden|accessdate=22 June 2010|newspaper=[[Der Standard]]|date=21 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"La Repubblica 22 June 2010\">{{cite news|last=Coen|first=Leonardo|title=L'ultima tentazione di Como: \"Vogliamo diventare svizzeri\"|url=http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2010/06/22/news/como_svizzera-5043821/|accessdate=22 June 2010|newspaper=[[La Repubblica]]|date=22 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Rockefeller fountain that today stands in the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York City was once in the main square (Piazza [[Camillo Benso|Cavour]]) by the lakeside.

As a consequence manufacturing is no longer the economic driver, and the city has been absorbed into [[Milan metropolitan area|Milan's metropolitan area]] where it mainly provides workers to the [[service industry]] sector. A significant number of residents are employed in the nearby industrial areas of the Swiss towns of [[Lugano]] and [[Mendrisio]], primarily in the [[industrial sector]], [[health care services]] and in the [[hospitality industry]]; the {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} commute is beneficial as wages in Switzerland are notably higher. For these reasons, tourism has become increasingly important for the local economy since the 1990s. The city and the lake have been [[Lake Como#Depictions in popular culture|chosen as the filming location]] for various recent popular feature films, and this, together with the increasing presence of celebrities who have bought lakeside properties, has heightened the city's international profile and given a further boost to international tourism.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe city of Como has seen its population count increase until it peaked at almost 100,000 inhabitants in the 1970s, when manufacturing, especially the silk industry, was in its boom years. As production began to decline, the population decreased by almost 20,000 people until the start of the 21st century, when the city saw its population grow again by more than six thousand, mainly because of immigration from Asia, Eastern Europe and North Africa. As of 31 December 2016, the population was 84,326 people of which 12,026 were resident aliens, that is, 14.1% of the total; the population distribution by origin was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=Cittadini Stranieri (Foreigners)|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/013/075/statistiche/stranieri.html|publisher=Comuni Italiani|accessdate= July 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n!

Sheriff Longmire's longtime friend Henry Standing Bear ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]), a [[Cheyenne]] man, provides insight to and sometimes aids in dealing with tribal police. (The [[Indian reservation]] has its own police force, which has authority within the reservation boundaries, except for capital crimes.) As the series progresses, the friends deal with issues of gambling at a casino on the reservation, issues of competing jurisdictional authority for protecting people and prosecuting crimes, and other issues of contemporary Native American life.\n\nIn the first season, Walt's adult daughter Cady ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) is concerned that her father has been stuck since the death of her mother. While preparing to run for re-election, Walt has delegated most police duties to deputies Branch Connally ([[Bailey Chase]]) and \"The Ferg\" (Adam Bartley). Branch has also entered the election, to unseat Longmire, and he is secretly dating Cady. Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti ([[Katee Sackhoff]]), a transplanted Philadelphia homicide detective, arrived in Wyoming six months prior and works as one of Walt's deputies.\n\nIn random [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes, Walt and Henry travel separately to [[Denver, Colorado]], where Walt attacks someone in a [[meth house]]. Denver Police Homicide Detective Fales ([[Charles S. Dutton]]) later comes to Wyoming to talk to Walt and Cady about Cady's mother's death. Cady is shocked to learn her mother was murdered, as Walt had told her she died of cancer. Fales tells Walt they found the murder suspect buried in a shallow grave. Walt denies killing the man; however, Detective Fales suspects that if Walt did not commit the murder, then Henry did.\n\nIn the second season, Cady goes to Denver to speak to Detective Fales, who gives her the details of her mother's murder and informs her the suspected murderer has also been killed. When Fales questions her, she says that her father confides in Henry Standing Bear, inadvertently giving Fales a new target of investigation. Henry tells Walt that he killed the murderer because Walt was unable to do so. Vic encounters Ed Gorski ([[Lee Tergesen]]), a retired cop from Philadelphia. They discuss the suicide of Gorski's former partner, whom Vic had implicated in a corruption scandal that prompted an internal affairs investigation. Gorski blames Vic for his partner's death and begins to stalk her. Frightened by Gorski's manner, Vic asks Henry for help, and Walt visits Gorski to warn him away. Gorski is subsequently beaten severely. Hector, a Cheyenne mercenary believed to have assaulted Gorski, is protected by Walt. Henry confesses to Walt that he hired Hector to kill Miller Beck, the murderer of Walt's wife, but Hector explains that he beat him and took his teeth as trophies. Fales and his team find the teeth at Henry's bar and arrest him. Walt wins the election. Cady is hospitalized after being hit by a car after hers is sabotaged. Branch investigates, leading to a confrontation with members of the local Cheyenne reservation.\n\nIn the third season, as Branch recovers from being shot, he comes to believe he was shot by David Ridges, a Cheyenne who was thought to have committed suicide and been cremated. Walt and the others do not believe him, and he begins his own investigation. In prison, Henry is abused by other Native Americans, led by former Cheyenne reservation police chief Malachi Strand ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]). Strand believes Henry contributed to his arrest through his friendship with Walt. When Malachi makes it difficult for Henry to obtain an attorney, Cady decides to represent him. Henry gets released on bail and sets out to prove his innocence.\n\nMalachi is also released and begins working as security for Jacob Nighthorse, a prominent Cheyenne businessman and developer. Both Branch and Henry uncover clues that point to Nighthorse's being involved in their cases, with Ridges as a key figure. Walt believes Nighthorse might have had a part in his wife's murder. He begins to believe that Branch is obsessed by his ideas about Ridges and suspends him temporarily, putting him in the care of his father Barlow. Walt and Henry learn that Ridges killed Miller Beck. Walt learns of Ridges' hideout location and kills him in a confrontation, in self defense. Fales drops all charges against Henry, but the investigations continue. Branch questions his father, who admits to having paid Nighthorse to hire Ridges to kill Walt's wife in hopes of helping Branch become sheriff. The season ends with the sound of a gunshot.\n\nIn the fourth season, Walt, Vic, and Ferg set out to search for Branch, after finding a disturbing typewritten note on his home computer. Walt finds him dead in a river from what appears to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound. Walt refuses to rule Branch's death a suicide after he finds soil in the shotgun shell. This shows that the shell had been ejected from firing and put back into the gun. Walt thinks that Nighthorse is behind the murder, until a drunken Barlow Connally confesses to the sheriff about killing his own son. The murder had followed Branch's finding out that his father had ordered the murder of Walt's wife. After his confession, Barlow provokes Walt to shoot and kill him, increasing official suspicion of the sheriff's behavior. Meanwhile, Walt and his department join forces with Mathias ([[Zahn McClarnon]]), chief of the Cheyenne tribal police, to investigate the rape of a Cheyenne woman, Gabriella ([[Julia Jones]]), by several oil-field workers. The men escape prosecution because of conflicting authority and the reluctance of federal officials to prosecute. Walker ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), the oil foreman, buys off Gabriella's family, who urge dropping the case. Henry takes up Hector's role of avenger and plans to exact justice on the rapists.  One is found dead, and Gabriella shoots the other as Henry is threatening him. Shot in the dark by Walt, Henry takes Gabriella into the [[Crow Nation]] territory to protect her. Both Walt and Walker seek to find her, ending up in a stand-off. Later, Mathias catches up with Henry and takes him into custody. Walt relaxes at home with his new love interest, Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan ([[Ally Walker]]), but an unknown intruder invades and shoots them.\n\nIn the fifth season, Walt conducts an intense search for the person who kidnapped Donna after the home invasion and seriously wounded him. Walt and Donna continue their relationship. Nighthorse becomes increasingly suspicious of Malachi's activities, and suspects he is skimming at the casino or otherwise earning illegal money. Mathias figures out that Henry has taken over Hector's duties as vigilante and uses that to his advantage. A heroin operation by the Irish mob is discovered in Walt's jurisdiction. Walt defends a wrongful-death suit; if he loses, he will lose everything he owns, and probably his job. Vic learns she is pregnant and suffers an assault. Walt ends his relationship with Donna. A future possibility of a relationship with Vic is suggested as they acknowledge their feelings toward each other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/longmire-season-6-cancelled-bloodline-happened-season-5-final-episode-watch/285699 |title= What Happened In Season 5 Final Episode? |last=Muppala |first=Savitha |date=September 26, 2016  |website=Movie News Guide |publisher=Tune Media |access-date=January 6, 2017 |quote=The finale sees Walt and Vic recognizing and acknowledging and their feelings for each other.}}</ref> As Henry gives a ride home to a presumably drunk woman, Malachi and his men kidnap him.

His uncle, Lucian Connally, was Walt's predecessor as sheriff, and Branch hopes to be sheriff one day, as well. He was romantically involved with Cady Longmire. After being shot by David Ridges in season two, he is shown during the next season recovering and investigating the attack. He was suspended from the force at the end of season three. \n* [[Cassidy Freeman]] as Cady Longmire is Walt's daughter, an attorney who initially works for a local law firm. Later, she works for Jacob Nighthorse, to provide representation to residents on the reservation. She was romantically involved with Branch Connally for a time.

In the series finale, her father convinces her to run for sheriff.\n* [[Adam Bartley]] as Archie \"The Ferg\" Ferguson is an awkward but hard-working young deputy, who felt unappreciated next to his more senior deputies, the handsome Branch Connally and the former Philadelphia Detective Vic Morretti. His eclectic knowledge and skills have helped solve cases, justifying Walt's hiring him, despite the fact that one reason Walt hired him was as a favor to his father. He continues to feel overlooked, even when he is promoted to a more senior deputy status. In the early seasons, he has an unrequited crush on Cady. In season five, he meets Meg, a local nurse.\n\n===Recurring===\n<!-- Recurring cast is listed in order of credits, and in order of their appearance on the show, as per [[WP:TVCAST]] -->\n* Louanne Stephens as Ruby - dispatcher and manager of the sheriff's office (seasons 1-6).\n* [[Zahn McClarnon]] as Chief Mathias - chief of the Cheyenne reservation's [[Indian tribal police|tribal police]] (seasons 1-6).\n* [[A Martinez]] as Jacob Nighthorse - a local Cheyenne businessman representing the interests of his people (seasons 1-6).

Sheriff Longmire's longtime friend Henry Standing Bear ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]), a [[Cheyenne]] man, provides insight to and sometimes aids in dealing with tribal police. (The [[Indian reservation]] has its own police force, which has authority within the reservation boundaries, except for capital crimes.) As the series progresses, the friends deal with issues of gambling at a casino on the reservation, issues of competing jurisdictional authority for protecting people and prosecuting crimes, and other issues of contemporary Native American life.\n\nIn the first season, Walt's adult daughter Cady ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) is concerned that her father has been stuck since the death of her mother. While preparing to run for re-election, Walt has delegated most police duties to deputies Branch Connally ([[Bailey Chase]]) and \"The Ferg\" (Adam Bartley). Branch has also entered the election, to unseat Longmire, and he is secretly dating Cady. Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti ([[Katee Sackhoff]]), a transplanted Philadelphia homicide detective, arrived in Wyoming six months prior and works as one of Walt's deputies.\n\nIn random [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes, Walt and Henry travel separately to [[Denver, Colorado]], where Walt attacks someone in a [[meth house]]. Denver Police Homicide Detective Fales ([[Charles S. Dutton]]) later comes to Wyoming to talk to Walt and Cady about Cady's mother's death. Cady is shocked to learn her mother was murdered, as Walt had told her she died of cancer. Fales tells Walt they found the murder suspect buried in a shallow grave. Walt denies killing the man; however, Detective Fales suspects that if Walt did not commit the murder, then Henry did.\n\nIn the second season, Cady goes to Denver to speak to Detective Fales, who gives her the details of her mother's murder and informs her the suspected murderer has also been killed. When Fales questions her, she says that her father confides in Henry Standing Bear, inadvertently giving Fales a new target of investigation. Henry tells Walt that he killed the murderer because Walt was unable to do so. Vic encounters Ed Gorski ([[Lee Tergesen]]), a retired cop from Philadelphia. They discuss the suicide of Gorski's former partner, whom Vic had implicated in a corruption scandal that prompted an internal affairs investigation. Gorski blames Vic for his partner's death and begins to stalk her. Frightened by Gorski's manner, Vic asks Henry for help, and Walt visits Gorski to warn him away. Gorski is subsequently beaten severely. Hector, a Cheyenne mercenary believed to have assaulted Gorski, is protected by Walt. Henry confesses to Walt that he hired Hector to kill Miller Beck, the murderer of Walt's wife, but Hector explains that he beat him and took his teeth as trophies. Fales and his team find the teeth at Henry's bar and arrest him. Walt wins the election. Cady is hospitalized after being hit by a car after hers is sabotaged. Branch investigates, leading to a confrontation with members of the local Cheyenne reservation.\n\nIn the third season, as Branch recovers from being shot, he comes to believe he was shot by David Ridges, a Cheyenne who was thought to have committed suicide and been cremated. Walt and the others do not believe him, and he begins his own investigation. In prison, Henry is abused by other Native Americans, led by former Cheyenne reservation police chief Malachi Strand ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]). Strand believes Henry contributed to his arrest through his friendship with Walt. When Malachi makes it difficult for Henry to obtain an attorney, Cady decides to represent him. Henry gets released on bail and sets out to prove his innocence.\n\nMalachi is also released and begins working as security for Jacob Nighthorse, a prominent Cheyenne businessman and developer. Both Branch and Henry uncover clues that point to Nighthorse's being involved in their cases, with Ridges as a key figure. Walt believes Nighthorse might have had a part in his wife's murder. He begins to believe that Branch is obsessed by his ideas about Ridges and suspends him temporarily, putting him in the care of his father Barlow. Walt and Henry learn that Ridges killed Miller Beck. Walt learns of Ridges' hideout location and kills him in a confrontation, in self defense. Fales drops all charges against Henry, but the investigations continue. Branch questions his father, who admits to having paid Nighthorse to hire Ridges to kill Walt's wife in hopes of helping Branch become sheriff. The season ends with the sound of a gunshot.\n\nIn the fourth season, Walt, Vic, and Ferg set out to search for Branch, after finding a disturbing typewritten note on his home computer. Walt finds him dead in a river from what appears to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound. Walt refuses to rule Branch's death a suicide after he finds soil in the shotgun shell. This shows that the shell had been ejected from firing and put back into the gun. Walt thinks that Nighthorse is behind the murder, until a drunken Barlow Connally confesses to the sheriff about killing his own son. The murder had followed Branch's finding out that his father had ordered the murder of Walt's wife. After his confession, Barlow provokes Walt to shoot and kill him, increasing official suspicion of the sheriff's behavior. Meanwhile, Walt and his department join forces with Mathias ([[Zahn McClarnon]]), chief of the Cheyenne tribal police, to investigate the rape of a Cheyenne woman, Gabriella ([[Julia Jones]]), by several oil-field workers. The men escape prosecution because of conflicting authority and the reluctance of federal officials to prosecute. Walker ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), the oil foreman, buys off Gabriella's family, who urge dropping the case. Henry takes up Hector's role of avenger and plans to exact justice on the rapists.  One is found dead, and Gabriella shoots the other as Henry is threatening him. Shot in the dark by Walt, Henry takes Gabriella into the [[Crow Nation]] territory to protect her. Both Walt and Walker seek to find her, ending up in a stand-off. Later, Mathias catches up with Henry and takes him into custody. Walt relaxes at home with his new love interest, Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan ([[Ally Walker]]), but an unknown intruder invades and shoots them.\n\nIn the fifth season, Walt conducts an intense search for the person who kidnapped Donna after the home invasion and seriously wounded him. Walt and Donna continue their relationship. Nighthorse becomes increasingly suspicious of Malachi's activities, and suspects he is skimming at the casino or otherwise earning illegal money. Mathias figures out that Henry has taken over Hector's duties as vigilante and uses that to his advantage. A heroin operation by the Irish mob is discovered in Walt's jurisdiction. Walt defends a wrongful-death suit; if he loses, he will lose everything he owns, and probably his job. Vic learns she is pregnant and suffers an assault. Walt ends his relationship with Donna. A future possibility of a relationship with Vic is suggested as they acknowledge their feelings toward each other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/longmire-season-6-cancelled-bloodline-happened-season-5-final-episode-watch/285699 |title= What Happened In Season 5 Final Episode? |last=Muppala |first=Savitha |date=September 26, 2016  |website=Movie News Guide |publisher=Tune Media |access-date=January 6, 2017 |quote=The finale sees Walt and Vic recognizing and acknowledging and their feelings for each other.}}</ref> As Henry gives a ride home to a presumably drunk woman, Malachi and his men kidnap him.

His uncle, Lucian Connally, was Walt's predecessor as sheriff, and Branch hopes to be sheriff one day, as well. He was romantically involved with Cady Longmire.

He was suspended from the force at the end of season three. \n* [[Cassidy Freeman]] as Cady Longmire is Walt's daughter, an attorney who initially works for a local law firm. Later, she works for Jacob Nighthorse, to provide representation to residents on the reservation. She was romantically involved with Branch Connally for a time.

His eclectic knowledge and skills have helped solve cases, justifying Walt's hiring him, despite the fact that one reason Walt hired him was as a favor to his father. He continues to feel overlooked, even when he is promoted to a more senior deputy status. In the early seasons, he has an unrequited crush on Cady.

In this transition, the sole criterion for production is [[use-value]] (i.e. direct satisfaction of human needs, or economic demands), therefore the [[law of value]] no longer directs economic activity. Marxist [[production for use]] is coordinated through conscious [[economic planning]]. Distribution of products is based on the principle of \"[[to each according to his contribution]]\". The social relations of socialism are characterized by the [[proletariat]] effectively controlling the [[means of production]], either through [[Cooperative|cooperative enterprises]] or by [[public ownership]] or private artisanal tools and [[Organizational self-management|self-management]]. [[Surplus value]] goes to the [[working class]] and hence [[society]] as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/o.htm#socialism|title=Socialism|work=Glossary of Terms|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] conception of [[socialism]] stands in contrast to other early conceptions of socialism, most notably early forms of [[market socialism]] based on [[classical economics]] such as [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Ricardian socialism]]. Unlike the Marxian conception, these conceptions of socialism retained commodity exchange ([[Market (economics)|markets]]) for labour and the means of production seeking to perfect the market process.<ref>{{cite book|last=McNally|first=David|title=Against the Market: Political Economy, Market Socialism and the Marxist Critique|publisher=Verso|year=1993|isbn=978-0-86091-606-2}}</ref> The Marxist idea of socialism was also heavily opposed to [[utopian socialism]].

The Marxist view of socialism served as a point of reference during the [[socialist calculation debate]].\n\nMarx himself did not use the term socialism to refer to this development. Instead, Marx called it a communist society that has not yet reached its higher-stage.<ref name=\"GothaCritique\"/> The term socialism was popularized during the [[Russian Revolution]] by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. This view is consistent with and helped to inform early concepts of socialism in which the law of value no longer directs economic activity. Monetary relations in the form of [[exchange-value]], [[Profit (economics)|profit]], [[interest]] and [[wage labour]] would not operate and apply to Marxist socialism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bockman|first=Johanna|title=Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8047-7566-3|page=20|quote=According to nineteenth-century socialist views, socialism would function without capitalist economic categories \u2013 such as money, prices, interest, profits and rent \u2013 and thus would function according to laws other than those described by current economic science. While some socialists recognized the need for money and prices at least during the transition from capitalism to socialism, socialists more commonly believed that the socialist economy would soon administratively mobilize the economy in physical units without the use of prices or money.}}</ref>\n\n== Mode of production ==\n{{see also|Mode of production}}\n[[Karl Marx]] described a socialist society as such:\n{{cquote|What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society \u2013 after the deductions have been made \u2013 exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.<ref name=\"GothaCritique\"/>}}\n\nSocialism is a post-[[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] economic system. and production is carried out to directly produce [[use-value]] rather than toward generating [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. The [[accumulation of capital]] is rendered insufficient in socialism as production is carried out independently of capital accumulation in a planned fashion. However, there have been other concepts of economic planning, including [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralised]] and [[participatory planning]]. One of Marx's main manuscripts is a posthumous work called ''[[Grundrisse]]'', published in 1953. In this work, Marx's thinking is explored regarding production, consumption, distribution, social impact of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]]. [[Communist society|Communism]] is considered as a living model for humans after capitalism. The emphasis is upon fair distribution of goods, equality and the optimum environment for humans to live in to develop themselves to their best capabilities (art, politics and philosophy, among others) to achieve happiness and to satisfy intrinsic needs. Marx's goal was to design a social system that eliminates the differences in [[Social class|classes]] between the [[proletariat]] and the [[bourgeoisie]]. In doing so, the tension and the power differences which force workers to labor in bad conditions for poor wages, disappear. According to Marx, capitalism is a system guaranteed to collapse because [[Big business|big companies]] would buy [[Small business|small companies]], leading to [[monopoly]]. In such a scenario, a very small number of people control most of the [[money]] and [[wikt:power|power]]. Poverty for the masses would prevail. Significant capital to buy products from the capitalist production system would be unavailable. Marx postulated that if workers are paid enough so that they still are able to buy products in a capitalist market, they will become essential contributors in assuring the [[Economic globalization|domination of capitalism worldwide]].\n\n[[Market (economics)|Market]] forces to compel capitalists to produce [[use-values]] in pursuit of exchange-value. Socialist production involves rational planning of use-values and coordination of investment decisions to attain economic goals.<ref>Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell (1998). \"The Difference Between Marxism and Market Socialism\". ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. p. 61\u201363. \"More fundamentally, a socialist society must be one in which the economy is run on the principle of the direct satisfaction of human needs. [...] Exchange-value, prices and so money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market. There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology. [...] It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality.\"</ref> In this approach, [[Business cycle|cyclical fluctuations]] that occur in a capitalist [[market economy]] do not exist in a socialist economy. The value of a good in socialism is its physical utility rather than its embodied labour, cost of production and exchange value as in a capitalist system. Socialism makes use of incentive-based systems, so inequality would still exist, but diminishingly so since workers are worker-owners. In this way, inequality is also diminished and capital and power is more widely distributed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-socialism-and-scientific.html|title=Karl Marx Socialism and Scientific Communism|publisher=Economic Theories|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref> The method of compensation and reward in a socialist society would be based on an authentic [[meritocracy]]{{citation needed|reason=The claim of meritocracy seems to be at odds with this paragraph and the Critique of the Gotha Programme from which it largely draws|date=October 2019}} along the principle of \"[[To each according to his contribution|From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution]]\".<ref name=\"GothaCritique\"/>\n\nThe advanced stage of socialism, referred to as the upper-stage communism in the ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'', is based on the socialist mode of production. However, it is different from lower-stage socialism in fundamental ways. While [[socialism]] implies [[public ownership]] (by a [[Proletarian state|proletarian semi-state]] apparatus) or [[cooperative ownership]] (by a [[worker cooperative]] enterprise), communism would be based on [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. Class distinctions based on [[ownership]] of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] cease to exist, along with the need for a state. A [[Post-scarcity economy|superabundance]] of [[goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] are made possible by [[Automation|automated production]] that allow for goods to be distributed based on need rather than merit.<ref>Marx, Karl (1875). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm \"Part 1\"]. ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]''. \"In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly \u2013 only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\"</ref>\n\n== Social relations ==\nThe fundamental goal of socialism from the view of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] was the realization of [[human freedom]] and [[individual autonomy]]. Specifically, this refers to [[Liberty|freedom]] from the [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] imposed upon [[individuals]] in the form of coercive [[social relations]] as well as material [[scarcity]], whereby the individual is compelled to engage in activities merely to survive to reproduce his or herself. The aim of socialism is to provide an environment whereby individuals are free to express their genuine interests, creative freedom and desires unhindered by forms of social control that force individuals to work for a class of owners who expropriate and live off the [[surplus product]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/ch06.htm|title=Marx's Concept Of Socialism|last=Fromm|first=Erich|year=1961|work=Marx's Concept of Man|publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs a set of social relations, socialism is defined by the degree to which economic activity in society is planned by the [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|associated producers]] so that the surplus product produced by socialised assets is controlled by a majority of the population through democratic processes. The sale of [[labour power]] would be abolished so that every individual participates in running their institution as stakeholders or members with no one having coercive power over anyone else in a vertical social [[division of labour]] which is to be distinguished from a non-social, technical division of labour which would still exist in socialism.<ref>Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell (1998). \"Definitions of market and socialism\". ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. pp. 58\u201359. \"For an Anti-Stalinist Marxist, socialism is defined by the degree to which the society is planned. Planning here is understood as the conscious regulation of society by the associated producers themselves. Put it differently, the control over the surplus product rests with the majority of the population through a resolutely democratic process. [...] The sale of labour power is abolished and labour necessarily becomes creative. Everyone participates in running their institutions and society as a whole. No one controls anyone else.\"</ref> The incentive structure changes in a socialist society given the change in the social environment so that an individual labourers' work becomes increasingly autonomous and creative, creating a sense of responsibility for his or her institution as a stakeholder.\n\n=== Role of the state ===\nIn Marxist theory, the [[State (polity)|state]] is \"the institution of organised violence which is used by the [[ruling class]] of a country to maintain the conditions of its rule. Thus, it is only in a society which is divided between hostile social classes that the state exists\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/t.htm#state|title=State|work=Glossary of Terms|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref> The state is seen as a mechanism dominated by the interests of the ruling class. It subjugates other classes, to protect and legitimize the existing [[economic system]].\n\nAfter a [[proletarian revolution]], the state would initially become the instrument of the [[proletariat]]. Conquest of the state by the proletariat is a prerequisite to establishing a socialist system. As socialism is built, the role and scope of the state changes. Class distinctions, based on ownership of the means of production, gradually deteriorate. The concentration of means of production increasingly falls into state hands. Once all means of production become state property, the primary function of the state changes. Political rule via coercion over men diminishes through the creation and enforcement of laws, scientific administration and the direction of the processes of production. As a result, the state becomes an entity of economic coordination rather than a mechanism of class or political control and is no longer a state in the Marxian sense.<ref>Engels, Friedrich (1880).

In this transition, the sole criterion for production is [[use-value]] (i.e. direct satisfaction of human needs, or economic demands), therefore the [[law of value]] no longer directs economic activity. Marxist [[production for use]] is coordinated through conscious [[economic planning]]. Distribution of products is based on the principle of \"[[to each according to his contribution]]\". The social relations of socialism are characterized by the [[proletariat]] effectively controlling the [[means of production]], either through [[Cooperative|cooperative enterprises]] or by [[public ownership]] or private artisanal tools and [[Organizational self-management|self-management]]. [[Surplus value]] goes to the [[working class]] and hence [[society]] as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/o.htm#socialism|title=Socialism|work=Glossary of Terms|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] conception of [[socialism]] stands in contrast to other early conceptions of socialism, most notably early forms of [[market socialism]] based on [[classical economics]] such as [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Ricardian socialism]]. Unlike the Marxian conception, these conceptions of socialism retained commodity exchange ([[Market (economics)|markets]]) for labour and the means of production seeking to perfect the market process.<ref>{{cite book|last=McNally|first=David|title=Against the Market: Political Economy, Market Socialism and the Marxist Critique|publisher=Verso|year=1993|isbn=978-0-86091-606-2}}</ref> The Marxist idea of socialism was also heavily opposed to [[utopian socialism]].

The Marxist view of socialism served as a point of reference during the [[socialist calculation debate]].\n\nMarx himself did not use the term socialism to refer to this development. Instead, Marx called it a communist society that has not yet reached its higher-stage.<ref name=\"GothaCritique\"/> The term socialism was popularized during the [[Russian Revolution]] by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. This view is consistent with and helped to inform early concepts of socialism in which the law of value no longer directs economic activity. Monetary relations in the form of [[exchange-value]], [[Profit (economics)|profit]], [[interest]] and [[wage labour]] would not operate and apply to Marxist socialism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bockman|first=Johanna|title=Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8047-7566-3|page=20|quote=According to nineteenth-century socialist views, socialism would function without capitalist economic categories \u2013 such as money, prices, interest, profits and rent \u2013 and thus would function according to laws other than those described by current economic science. While some socialists recognized the need for money and prices at least during the transition from capitalism to socialism, socialists more commonly believed that the socialist economy would soon administratively mobilize the economy in physical units without the use of prices or money.}}</ref>\n\n== Mode of production ==\n{{see also|Mode of production}}\n[[Karl Marx]] described a socialist society as such:\n{{cquote|What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society \u2013 after the deductions have been made \u2013 exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.<ref name=\"GothaCritique\"/>}}\n\nSocialism is a post-[[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] economic system. and production is carried out to directly produce [[use-value]] rather than toward generating [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. The [[accumulation of capital]] is rendered insufficient in socialism as production is carried out independently of capital accumulation in a planned fashion. However, there have been other concepts of economic planning, including [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralised]] and [[participatory planning]]. One of Marx's main manuscripts is a postumous work called ''[[Grundrisse]]'', published in 1953. In this work, Marx's thinking is explored regarding production, consumption, distribution, social impact of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]]. [[Communist society|Communism]] is considered as a living model for humans after capitalism. The emphasis is upon fair distribution of goods, equality and the optimum environment for humans to live in to develop themselves to their best capabilities (art, politics and philosophy, among others) to achieve happiness and to satisfy intrinsic needs. Marx's goal was to design a social system that eliminates the differences in [[Social class|classes]] between the [[proletariat]] and the [[bourgeoisie]]. In doing so, the tension and the power differences which force workers to labor in bad conditions for poor wages, disappear. According to Marx, capitalism is a system guaranteed to collapse because [[Big business|big companies]] would buy [[Small business|small companies]], leading to [[monopoly]]. In such a scenario, a very small number of people control most of the [[money]] and [[wikt:power|power]]. Poverty for the masses would prevail. Significant capital to buy products from the capitalist production system would be unavailable. Marx postulated that if workers are paid enough so that they still are able to buy products in a capitalist market, they will become essential contributors in assuring the [[Economic globalization|domination of capitalism worldwide]].\n\n[[Market (economics)|Market]] forces to compel capitalists to produce [[use-values]] in pursuit of exchange-value. Socialist production involves rational planning of use-values and coordination of investment decisions to attain economic goals.<ref>Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell (1998). \"The Difference Between Marxism and Market Socialism\". ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. p. 61\u201363. \"More fundamentally, a socialist society must be one in which the economy is run on the principle of the direct satisfaction of human needs. [...] Exchange-value, prices and so money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market. There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology. [...] It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality.\"</ref> In this approach, [[Business cycle|cyclical fluctuations]] that occur in a capitalist [[market economy]] do not exist in a socialist economy. The value of a good in socialism is its physical utility rather than its embodied labour, cost of production and exchange value as in a capitalist system. Socialism makes use of incentive-based systems, so inequality would still exist, but diminishingly so since workers are worker-owners. In this way, inequality is also diminished and capital and power is more widely distributed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-socialism-and-scientific.html|title=Karl Marx Socialism and Scientific Communism|publisher=Economic Theories|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref> The method of compensation and reward in a socialist society would be based on an authentic [[meritocracy]]{{citation needed|reason=The claim of meritocracy seems to be at odds with this paragraph and the Critique of the Gotha Programme from which it largely draws|date=October 2019}} along the principle of \"[[To each according to his contribution|From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution]]\".<ref name=\"GothaCritique\"/>\n\nThe advanced stage of socialism, referred to as the upper-stage communism in the ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'', is based on the socialist mode of production. However, it is different from lower-stage socialism in fundamental ways. While [[socialism]] implies [[public ownership]] (by a [[Proletarian state|proletarian semi-state]] apparatus) or [[cooperative ownership]] (by a [[worker cooperative]] enterprise), communism would be based on [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. Class distinctions based on [[ownership]] of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] cease to exist, along with the need for a state. A [[Post-scarcity economy|superabundance]] of [[goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] are made possible by [[Automation|automated production]] that allow for goods to be distributed based on need rather than merit.<ref>Marx, Karl (1875). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm \"Part 1\"]. ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]''. \"In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly \u2013 only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\"</ref>\n\n== Social relations ==\nThe fundamental goal of socialism from the view of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] was the realization of [[human freedom]] and [[individual autonomy]]. Specifically, this refers to [[Liberty|freedom]] from the [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] imposed upon [[individuals]] in the form of coercive [[social relations]] as well as material [[scarcity]], whereby the individual is compelled to engage in activities merely to survive to reproduce his or herself. The aim of socialism is to provide an environment whereby individuals are free to express their genuine interests, creative freedom and desires unhindered by forms of social control that force individuals to work for a class of owners who expropriate and live off the [[surplus product]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/ch06.htm|title=Marx's Concept Of Socialism|last=Fromm|first=Erich|year=1961|work=Marx's Concept of Man|publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs a set of social relations, socialism is defined by the degree to which economic activity in society is planned by the [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|associated producers]] so that the surplus product produced by socialised assets is controlled by a majority of the population through democratic processes. The sale of [[labour power]] would be abolished so that every individual participates in running their institution as stakeholders or members with no one having coercive power over anyone else in a vertical social [[division of labour]] which is to be distinguished from a non-social, technical division of labour which would still exist in socialism.<ref>Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell (1998). \"Definitions of market and socialism\". ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. pp. 58\u201359. \"For an Anti-Stalinist Marxist, socialism is defined by the degree to which the society is planned. Planning here is understood as the conscious regulation of society by the associated producers themselves. Put it differently, the control over the surplus product rests with the majority of the population through a resolutely democratic process. [...] The sale of labour power is abolished and labour necessarily becomes creative. Everyone participates in running their institutions and society as a whole. No one controls anyone else.\"</ref> The incentive structure changes in a socialist society given the change in the social environment so that an individual labourers' work becomes increasingly autonomous and creative, creating a sense of responsibility for his or her institution as a stakeholder.\n\n=== Role of the state ===\nIn Marxist theory, the [[State (polity)|state]] is \"the institution of organised violence which is used by the [[ruling class]] of a country to maintain the conditions of its rule. Thus, it is only in a society which is divided between hostile social classes that the state exists\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/t.htm#state|title=State|work=Glossary of Terms|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref> The state is seen as a mechanism dominated by the interests of the ruling class. It subjugates other classes, to protect and legitimize the existing [[economic system]].\n\nAfter a [[proletarian revolution]], the state would initially become the instrument of the [[proletariat]]. Conquest of the state by the proletariat is a prerequisite to establishing a socialist system. As socialism is built, the role and scope of the state changes. Class distinctions, based on ownership of the means of production, gradually deteriorate. The concentration of means of production increasingly falls into state hands. Once all means of production become state property, the primary function of the state changes. Political rule via coercion over men diminishes through the creation and enforcement of laws, scientific administration and the direction of the processes of production. As a result, the state becomes an entity of economic coordination rather than a mechanism of class or political control and is no longer a state in the Marxian sense.<ref>Engels, Friedrich (1880).
