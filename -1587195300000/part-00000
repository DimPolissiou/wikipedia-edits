Agne Wideheim [[Sweden]] 1918-2007.]]\nA '''tailor''' is a person who makes, repairs, or alters clothing professionally, especially suits and men's clothing.\n\nAlthough the term dates to the thirteenth century, ''tailor'' took on its modern sense in the late eighteenth century, and now refers to makers of men's and women's [[suit (clothing)|suits]], [[coat (clothing)|coat]]s, [[trousers]], and similar garments, usually of [[wool]], [[linen]], or [[silk]].\n\nThe term refers to a set of specific hand and machine sewing and pressing techniques that are unique to the construction of traditional jackets. Retailers of tailored suits often take their services internationally, traveling to various cities, allowing the client to be measured locally.\n\nTraditional tailoring is called \"[[bespoke tailoring]]\" in the United Kingdom, where the heart of the trade is London's [[Savile Row  tailoring]], and \"custom tailoring\" in the United States and [[Hong Kong]]. This is unlike [[made to measure]] which uses pre-existing patterns. A bespoke  garment or suit is completely original and unique to each customer.\n\nFamous fictional tailors include the tailor in ''[[The Tailor of Gloucester]]'', ''[[The Emperor's New Clothes]] '' and ''[[The Valiant Little Tailor]]''. A more recent example is [[John le Carr\u00e9]]'s ''[[The Tailor of Panama]]''.\n\n==Types==\n[[Image:A tailor fitting a customer (Belgrade, 1937).jpg|left|thumb|upright=.8|Fitting a customer]]\n[[Image:TailoringFirstFitFront01.jpg|right|thumb|Tailoring first fitting]]\nAs the tailoring profession has evolved, so too have the methods of tailoring. There are a number of distinctive business models which modern tailors may practice. While some may practice many, there are others who will practice only one or two.\n===Local tailoring===\nLocal tailoring is as the name implies. Typically the tailor is met locally and the garment produced locally. This method enables the tailor to take professional measurements, assess posture and body shape to make unique modifications to the garment. Local tailors will typically have a showroom or shopfront allowing clients to choose fabrics from samples or return the garment easily should it require further modification.  This is the most traditional form of tailoring. [[Hong Kong Tailors]] and London are the most famous for high quality [[bespoke]] tailoring, in average it takes about 2 to 3 fittings and about 50 to 70 working hours to handmake one suit.\n\n===Distance tailoring===\n[[File:House-of-dapper-nl.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Coat of arms|Coat of Arms]] of House of Dapper, a tailor based in [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.houseofdapper.nl|title=House of Dapper tailors|last=|first=|date=2019|website=House of Dapper|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>]]\n[[Image:John's.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Cloth merchant|Clothier]] and tailor in the [[Financial District, Boston, Massachusetts|Financial District]] of [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]]]\nDistance tailoring involves ordering a garment from an out-of-town tailor enabling cheaper labour to be used. In practice this can now be done on a global scale via e-commerce websites. Unlike local tailoring, customers must take their own measurements, fabric selection must be made from a photo and if further alterations are required the garment must be shipped.  Today, the most common platform for distance tailoring is via online tailors.\n\nOnline tailors sometimes offer to pay for needed alterations at a local tailor.  Another new option is the concept where a free test suit is made to the provided measurements and shipped to the customer first.  The test suit can be tried on and worn to see where any adjustments are wanted.  The final suit is then tailored to the new specifications provided by the test suit fitting.\n\n===Traveling tailor===\nUnlike tailors who do distance tailoring, traveling tailors provide a more personal service to their customers and give the customers an opportunity to see the fabric samples and meet the tailor in person. Traveling tailors travel between cities and station in a local luxury hotel for a short period of time to meet and provide the same tailoring services they would provide in their local store. In the hotel, the customer will be able to select the fabric from samples and the tailor will take the measurements himself. The order then will be shipped to the customer within 3\u20134 weeks time. Unlike local tailoring, if further alterations are required the garment must be shipped. Today, most traveling tailors are from Hong Kong, traveling to the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia and Japan.\n\n==Related terms==\n[[File:Brownell's trouser button.jpg|upright|thumb|Vintage tailor's button from [[Hobart, Tasmania]]]]\n[[File:Zackenschere.jpg|thumb|[[Pinking shears]]]]\n* A ''tailor-made'' is a man's suit consisting of a (usually) [[woolen]] or [[tweed (cloth)|tweed]] [[coat (clothing)|coat]] and [[pants]]; the name arose during the [[Edwardian period]].\n* As an adjective, ''tailor-made'' (from the second half of the twentieth century usually simplified to ''tailored'') refers to [[clothing]] made by or in the style of clothes made by a tailor, characterized by simplicity of [[cut (clothing)|cut]] and [[trim (sewing)|trim]] and fine (often hand) finishing; as a women's clothing style ''tailored'' as opposed to [[dressmaker]].\n*''Rodeo tailor'' is a term for a creator of the flamboyant costumes typical of [[country music|country and western]] musicians, characterized by extensive hand [[embroidery]], an abundance of [[rhinestone]]s, and [[cowboy]] details such as [[pearl]] [[Snap fastener|snaps]] and [[western wear|arrowhead pockets]].\n* In some documents, tailor means ''adjust'', and tailoring means ''adjusting''.\n\n'''''Sewing professional''''' is the most general term for those who make their living by sewing, teaching, writing about sewing, or retailing sewing supplies.

Cliffe was also occasionally connected with opera productions at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].<ref name=MT/>\n\nCliffe had a short career as a composer from 1889 to 1905. His principal works were his two symphonies, the first of which was produced  by [[August Manns]] at [[The Crystal Palace]] in 1889, and subsequently performed at a Philharmonic concert, being well received on each occasion, with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' hailing it as \"a masterpiece\". Although not overtly programmatic, its first movement was influenced by a visit to [[Norway]] by Cliffe. It was published by Novello.  His Second Symphony had its first performance at the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festival]] in 1892. Cliffe gave titles to each of its movements: I. At Sunset. II. Night. III. Fairy Revels. IV. Morning.  It has been edited (2010) by Lionel Harrison and published by Patrick Meadows.\n\nHis 'scena', ''The Triumph of Alcestis'', for contralto voice and orchestra, was composed for [[Clara Butt]], and from 1905 his setting of [[Shelley]]'s ''[[Ode to the West Wind]]'' was popular with choral societies. However, after that seventeen-year period of producing substantial works he stopped composing altogether, and subsequently his works received few performances during his lifetime.

In 1873 at the age of sixteen he was appointed organist to the [[Bradford Festival Choral Society]].<ref>Leach, Gerald. ''British Composer Profiles'', 3rd Edition (2012)</ref> As organist to the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festival]], Cliffe took part in the first performance of Sullivan's cantata [[The Golden Legend (cantata)|''The Golden Legend'']] on 6 October 1886.<ref name=MT>''Musical Times'' obituary, January 1932, p 80</ref>\n\nFrom 1884 to 1931 he held the post of Professor of Piano at the Royal College of Music.<ref name=\"RCM\"/>  Among his pupils there were [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] and [[Arthur Benjamin]]. Cliffe was also occasionally connected with opera productions at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].<ref name=MT/>\n\nCliffe had a short career as a composer from 1889 to 1905. His principal works were his two symphonies, the first of which was produced  by [[August Manns]] at [[The Crystal Palace]] in 1889, and subsequently performed at a Philharmonic concert, being well received on each occasion, with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' hailing it as \"a masterpiece\". Although not overtly programmatic, its first movement was influenced by a visit to [[Norway]] by Cliffe. It was published by Novello.  His Second Symphony had its first performance at the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festival]] in 1892. Cliffe gave titles to each of its movements: I. At Sunset. II. Night. III. Fairy Revels. IV. Morning.  It has been edited (2010) by Lionel Harrison and published by Patrick Meadows.\n\nHis 'scena', ''The Triumph of Alcestis'', for contralto voice and orchestra, was composed for [[Clara Butt]], and from 1905 his setting of [[Shelley]]'s ''[[Ode to the West Wind]]'' was popular with choral societies. However, after that seventeen-year period of producing substantial works he stopped composing altogether, and subsequently his works received few performances during his lifetime.
