These Emperors are [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]], [[Lucius Verus]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], and [[Commodus]]. The first five of them (excluding Lucius Verus) are commonly known as the \"'''Five Good Emperors'''\". \n\nThe first five of the six successions within this dynasty were notable in that the reigning Emperor [[Roman adoption|adopted]] the candidate of his choice to be his successor. Under Roman law, an adoption established a bond legally as strong as that of kinship.  Because of this, all but the first and last of the Nerva\u2013Antonine emperors are called '''Adoptive Emperors'''.\n\nThe importance of official adoption in Roman society has often been considered<ref>E.g. by Machiavelli and Gibbon</ref> as a conscious repudiation of the principle of dynastic inheritance and has been deemed one of the factors of the period's prosperity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unrv.com/five-good-emperors/adoptive-succession.php |title=Adoptive Succession |accessdate= 2007-09-18}}</ref> However, this was not a new practice. It was common for patrician families to adopt, and Roman emperors had adopted heirs in the past: the Emperor [[Augustus]] had adopted [[Tiberius]] and the Emperor [[Claudius]] had adopted [[Nero]]. [[Julius Caesar]], [[dictator perpetuo]] and considered to be instrumental in [[Roman Republic#The period of transition (49\u201329 BC)|the transition from Republic to Empire]], adopted Gaius Octavius, who would become [[Augustus]], Rome's first emperor.  Moreover, there was a family connection as Trajan adopted his first cousin once removed and great-nephew by marriage [[Hadrian]], and Hadrian made his half-nephew by marriage and heir Antoninus Pius adopt both Hadrian's second cousin three times removed and half-great-nephew by marriage Marcus Aurelius, also Antoninus' nephew by marriage, and the son of [[Lucius Aelius|his original planned successor]], Lucius Verus. The naming by Marcus Aurelius of his son Commodus was considered to be an unfortunate choice and the beginning of the Empire's decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unrv.com/decline-of-empire/decline-of-empire.php |title=Decline of the Roman Empire |accessdate= 2007-09-18}}</ref>\n\nWith Commodus' murder in 192, the Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty came to an end; it was followed by a period of turbulence known as the [[Year of the Five Emperors]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Nerva\u2013Trajan dynasty ===\n[[Nerva]] was the first of the dynasty. Though his reign was short, it saw a partial reconciliation between the army, Senate and commoners. Nerva adopted as his son the popular military leader [[Trajan]]. In turn, [[Hadrian]] succeeded Trajan; he had been the latter's heir presumptive and averred that he had been adopted by him on Trajan's deathbed.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Nerva Tivoli Massimo.jpg|Nerva\nFile:Traianus Glyptothek Munich 72.jpg|Trajan\nFile:Bust Hadrian Musei Capitolini MC817.jpg|Hadrian\n</gallery>\n\n=== Antonine dynasty ===\nThe '''Antonines''' are four [[Roman Emperors]] who ruled between 138 and 192: [[Antoninus Pius]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Lucius Verus]] and [[Commodus]].\n\nIn 138, after a long reign dedicated to the cultural unification and consolidation of the empire, the Emperor [[Hadrian]] named Antoninus Pius his son and heir, under the condition that he adopt both Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. Hadrian died that same year, and Antoninus began a peaceful, benevolent reign. He adhered strictly to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] traditions and institutions and shared his power with the [[Roman Senate]].\n\nMarcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus succeeded Antoninus Pius in 161 upon that emperor's death, and co-ruled until Verus' death in 169. Marcus continued the Antonine legacy after Verus' death as an unpretentious and gifted administrator and leader. He died in 180 and was followed by his biological son, Commodus.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Antoninus Pius (Museo del Prado) 01.jpg|Antoninus Pius\nFile:Marcus Aurelius Metropolitan Museum.png|Marcus Aurelius\nFile:Lucius verus.jpg|Lucius Verus\nFile:Commodus Musei Capitolini MC1120.jpg|Commodus\n</gallery>\n\n== Five Good Emperors ==\nThe rulers commonly known as the \"'''Five Good Emperors'''\" were [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]].<ref name = AHoWS>[[John P. McKay|McKay, John P.]]; Hill, Bennett D.; Buckler, John; Ebrey, Patricia B.; & Beck, Roger B. (2007). ''[[A History of World Societies]]'' (7th ed.). [[Boston]]: [[Houghton Mifflin Company]], v\u2013vi. {{ISBN|978-0-618-61093-8}}.</ref> The term was coined by [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] in ''[[The Discourses on Livy]]'':\n{{blockquote|From the study of this history we may also learn how a good government is to be established; for while all the emperors who succeeded to the throne by birth, except [[Titus]], were bad, all were good who succeeded by adoption, as in the case of the five from Nerva to Marcus. But as soon as the empire fell once more to the heirs by birth, its ruin recommenced.<ref name=\"Mac\">Machiavelli, ''Discourses on Livy'', Book I, Chapter 10.</ref>}}\n\nMachiavelli argued that these adopted emperors earned the respect of those around them through good governing:\n{{blockquote|Titus, Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus, and Marcus had no need of praetorian cohorts, or of countless legions to guard them, but were defended by their own good lives, the good-will of their subjects, and the attachment of the senate.<ref name=\"Mac\" />}}\n\n[[Edward Gibbon]] wrote in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' that their rule was a time when \"the Roman Empire was governed by absolute power, under the guidance of wisdom and virtue\".<ref name=\"Gib\">Gibbon, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', I.78.</ref> Gibbon believed that these benevolent monarchs and their moderate policies were unusual and contrasted with their more tyrannical and oppressive successors. \n\n=== Alternative hypothesis ===\nOne hypothesis posits that adoptive succession is thought to have arisen because of a lack of biological heirs. All but the last of the adoptive emperors had no legitimate biological sons to succeed them. They were thus obliged to pick a successor somewhere else; as soon as the Emperor could look towards a biological son to succeed him, adoptive succession was set aside.\n\nThe dynasty may be broken up into the [[#Nerva\u2013Trajan dynasty|Nerva\u2013Trajan dynasty]] (also called the [[Ulpia (gens)|Ulpian]] dynasty after Trajan's ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen gentile]]'' 'Ulpius') and [[#Antonine dynasty|Antonine dynasty]] (after their common name Antoninus).\n\n=== The Jewish viewpoint ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2019}}\nThe concept of \"The Five Good Emperors\" reflects the internal Roman point of view. As regards their treatment of Roman citizens, these five Emperors clearly seem better than other Emperors \u2013 specifically, better than Domitian who immediately preceded them and Commodus who immediately followed them \u2013 and this view was taken up by later Europeans, drawing on Roman historical sources. It is, however, not necessarily the point of view of provincials and of Rome's neighbors \u2013 particularly, of those targeted by one or more of these emperors in a war of conquest or in the suppression of a revolt. \n\nIn many cases, such diverging points of view did not leave a record; for example, there is no surviving historical source recording the [[Dacians]]' opinion of [[Trajan]], who conquered them. However, in the case of the [[Jews]], who suffered greatly at the suppression of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] by [[Hadrian]], there is an extensive [[rabbinic literature]] offering a very different perspective from that of Roman historiography. While the Roman view lumped Hadrian and Antoninus Pius together among the Five Good Emperors, Jews tended to contrast the Bad Hadrian with the Good Antoninus. When Jewish sources mention Hadrian it is always with the epitaph \"may his bones be crushed\" ({{lang-he|\u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05e7 \u05e2\u05e6\u05de\u05d5\u05ea}}, {{lang-arc|\u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d8\u05de\u05d9\u05d0}}<ref>The Aramaic version, \"\u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d8\u05de\u05d9\u05d0\", is used, e.g., in [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%A9_%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%97 Genesis Rabbah 78:1].

These Emperors are [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]], [[Lucius Verus]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], and [[Commodus]]. The first five of them (excluding Lucius Verus) are commonly known as the \"'''Five Good Emperors'''\". \n\nThe first five of the six successions within this dynasty were notable in that the reigning Emperor [[Roman adoption|adopted]] the candidate of his choice to be his successor. Under Roman law, an adoption established a bond legally as strong as that of kinship.  Because of this, all but the first and last of the Nerva\u2013Antonine emperors are called '''Adoptive Emperors'''.\n\nThe importance of official adoption in Roman society has often been considered<ref>E.g. by Machiavelli and Gibbon</ref> as a conscious repudiation of the principle of dynastic inheritance and has been deemed one of the factors of the period's prosperity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unrv.com/five-good-emperors/adoptive-succession.php |title=Adoptive Succession |accessdate= 2007-09-18}}</ref> However, this was not a new practice. It was common for patrician families to adopt, and Roman emperors had adopted heirs in the past: the Emperor [[Augustus]] had adopted [[Tiberius]] and the Emperor [[Claudius]] had adopted [[Nero]]. [[Julius Caesar]], [[dictator perpetuo]] and considered to be instrumental in [[Roman Republic#The period of transition (49\u201329 BC)|the transition from Republic to Empire]], adopted Gaius Octavius, who would become [[Augustus]], Rome's first emperor.  Moreover, there was a family connection as Trajan adopted his first cousin once removed and great-nephew by marriage [[Hadrian]], and Hadrian made his half-nephew by marriage and heir Antoninus Pius adopt both Hadrian's second cousin three times removed and half-great-nephew by marriage Marcus Aurelius, also Antoninus' nephew by marriage, and the son of [[Lucius Aelius|his original planned successor]], Lucius Verus. The naming by Marcus Aurelius of his son Commodus was considered to be an unfortunate choice and the beginning of the Empire's decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unrv.com/decline-of-empire/decline-of-empire.php |title=Decline of the Roman Empire |accessdate= 2007-09-18}}</ref>\n\nWith Commodus' murder in 192, the Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty came to an end; it was followed by a period of turbulence known as the [[Year of the Five Emperors]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Nerva\u2013Trajan dynasty ===\n[[Nerva]] was the first of the dynasty. Though his reign was short, it saw a partial reconciliation between the army, Senate and commoners. Nerva adopted as his son the popular military leader [[Trajan]]. In turn, [[Hadrian]] succeeded Trajan; he had been the latter's heir presumptive and averred that he had been adopted by him on Trajan's deathbed.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Nerva Tivoli Massimo.jpg|Nerva\nFile:Traianus Glyptothek Munich 72.jpg|Trajan\nFile:Bust Hadrian Musei Capitolini MC817.jpg|Hadrian\n</gallery>\n\n=== Antonine dynasty ===\nThe '''Antonines''' are four [[Roman Emperors]] who ruled between 138 and 192: [[Antoninus Pius]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Lucius Verus]] and [[Commodus]].\n\nIn 138, after a long reign dedicated to the cultural unification and consolidation of the empire, the Emperor [[Hadrian]] named Antoninus Pius his son and heir, under the condition that he adopt both Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. Hadrian died that same year, and Antoninus began a peaceful, benevolent reign. He adhered strictly to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] traditions and institutions and shared his power with the [[Roman Senate]].\n\nMarcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus succeeded Antoninus Pius in 161 upon that emperor's death, and co-ruled until Verus' death in 169. Marcus continued the Antonine legacy after Verus' death as an unpretentious and gifted administrator and leader. He died in 180 and was followed by his biological son, Commodus.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Antoninus Pius (Museo del Prado) 01.jpg|Antoninus Pius\nFile:Marcus Aurelius Metropolitan Museum.png|Marcus Aurelius\nFile:Lucius verus.jpg|Lucius Verus\nFile:Commodus Musei Capitolini MC1120.jpg|Commodus\n</gallery>\n\n== Five Good Emperors ==\nThe rulers commonly known as the \"'''Five Good Emperors'''\" were [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]].<ref name = AHoWS>[[John P. McKay|McKay, John P.]]; Hill, Bennett D.; Buckler, John; Ebrey, Patricia B.; & Beck, Roger B. (2007). ''[[A History of World Societies]]'' (7th ed.). [[Boston]]: [[Houghton Mifflin Company]], v\u2013vi. {{ISBN|978-0-618-61093-8}}.</ref> The term was coined by [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] in ''[[The Discourses on Livy]]'':\n{{blockquote|From the study of this history we may also learn how a good government is to be established; for while all the emperors who succeeded to the throne by birth, except [[Titus]], were bad, all were good who succeeded by adoption, as in the case of the five from Nerva to Marcus. But as soon as the empire fell once more to the heirs by birth, its ruin recommenced.<ref name=\"Mac\">Machiavelli, ''Discourses on Livy'', Book I, Chapter 10.</ref>}}\n\nMachiavelli argued that these adopted emperors earned the respect of those around them through good governing:\n{{blockquote|Titus, Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus, and Marcus had no need of praetorian cohorts, or of countless legions to guard them, but were defended by their own good lives, the good-will of their subjects, and the attachment of the senate.<ref name=\"Mac\" />}}\n\n[[Edward Gibbon]] wrote in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' that their rule was a time when \"the Roman Empire was governed by absolute power, under the guidance of wisdom and virtue\".<ref name=\"Gib\">Gibbon, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', I.78.</ref> Gibbon believed that these benevolent monarchs and their moderate policies were unusual and contrasted with their more tyrannical and oppressive successors. \n\n=== Alternative hypothesis ===\nOne hypothesis posits that adoptive succession is thought to have arisen because of a lack of biological heirs. All but the last of the adoptive emperors had no legitimate biological sons to succeed them. They were thus obliged to pick a successor somewhere else; as soon as the Emperor could look towards a biological son to succeed him, adoptive succession was set aside.\n\nThe dynasty may be broken up into the [[#Nerva\u2013Trajan dynasty|Nerva\u2013Trajan dynasty]] (also called the [[Ulpia (gens)|Ulpian]] dynasty after Trajan's ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen gentile]]'' 'Ulpius') and [[#Antonine dynasty|Antonine dynasty]] (after their common name Antoninus).\n\n=== The Jewish viewpoint ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2019}}\nThe concept of \"The Five Good Emperors\" reflects the internal Roman point of view. As regards their treatment of Roman citizens, these five Emperors clearly seem better than other Emperors \u2013 specifically, better than Domitian who immediately preceded them and Commodus who immediately followed them \u2013 and this view was taken up by later Europeans, drawing on Roman historical sources. It is, however, not necessarily the point of view of provincials and of Rome's neighbors \u2013 particularly, of those targeted by one or more of these emperors in a war of conquest or in the suppression of a revolt. \n\nIn many cases, such diverging points of view did not leave a record; for example, there is no surviving historical source recording the [[Dacians]]' opinion of [[Trajan]], who conquered them. However, in the case of the [[Jews]], who suffered greatly at the suppression of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] by [[Hadrian]], there is an extensive [[rabbinic literature]] offering a very different perspective from that of Roman historiography. While the Roman view lumped Hadrian and Antoninus Pius together among the Five Good Emperors, Jews tended to contrast the Bad Hadrian with the Good Antoninus. When Jewish sources mention Hadrian it is always with the epitaph \"may his bones be crushed\" ({{lang-he|\u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05e7 \u05e2\u05e6\u05de\u05d5\u05ea}}, {{lang-arc|\u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d8\u05de\u05d9\u05d0}}<ref>The Aramaic version, \"\u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d8\u05de\u05d9\u05d0\", is used, e.g., in [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%A9_%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%97 Genesis Rabbah 78:1].

The predecessor DB11 V12 had been in production for only 18 months and it is believed this move was substantially due to the new V8 DB11 performing better than expected, narrowing the performance gap with the V12.\n\nIt has received vast improvements over the outgoing model, such as a power increase to {{cvt|639|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} from its 5.2-litre ''AE31'' twin-turbocharged V12 engine, revised shift programming for the 8-speed automatic transmission for quicker gear changes, firmer and stiffer rear suspension, improvement in {{cvt|0-60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} acceleration time to 3.5 seconds and an increased top speed of {{cvt|208|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Other unique features include a more aggressive exhaust note in Sport & Sport+ mode, black roof, dark interior trim and new 3.5 kg lighter, 20-inch forged alloy wheels.\n\nAston Martin produced a limited run of 100 DB11 AMR Signature Edition cars at the start of production featuring a Stirling Green paint scheme with Lime Green accents; similar to that found on the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2019)|Vantage GTE]] race car, black interior trim with lime green stitching and gloss black forged 20-inch alloy wheels. The DB11 AMR is priced at GB\u00a3182,520 (US$241,000) while the Signature Edition costs GB\u00a321,963 (US$29,000) more.

The predecessor DB11 V12 had been in production for only 18 months and it is believed this move was substantially due to the new V8 DB11 performing better than expected, narrowing the performance gap with the V12.\n\nIt has received vast improvements over the outgoing model, such as a power increase to {{cvt|639|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} from its 5.2-litre ''AE31'' twin-turbocharged V12 engine, revised shift programming for the 8-speed automatic transmission for quicker gear changes, firmer and stiffer rear suspension, improvement in {{cvt|0-60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} acceleration time to 3.5 seconds and an increased top speed of {{cvt|208|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Other unique features include a more aggressive exhaust note in Sport & Sport+ mode, black roof, dark interior trim and new 3.5 kg lighter, 20-inch forged alloy wheels.\n\nAston Martin produced a limited run of 100 DB11 AMR Signature Edition cars at the start of production featuring a Stirling Green paint scheme with Lime Green accents; similar to that found on the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2019)|Vantage GTE]] race car, black interior trim with lime green stitching and gloss black forged 20-inch alloy wheels. The DB11 AMR is priced at GB\u00a3182,520 (US$241,000) while the Signature Edition costs GB\u00a321,963 (US$29,000) more.

Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]'s party ate sled dogs during his expedition to the South Pole. This allowed the party to carry less food, thus lightening the load.<ref name=southpole /> When comparing sled dogs to ponies as draught animals he also notes:\n<blockquote>there is the obvious advantage that dog can be fed on dog. One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get fresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and [[pemmican]] the whole way, and this enabled them to do splendid work. And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The dogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from. All that was left after one of these canine meals was the teeth of the victim \u2013 and if it had been a really hard day, these also disappeared.<ref name=southpole >{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|title=The South Pole|first=Roald|last=Amundsen|access-date=2009-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926120454/http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|archive-date=2009-09-26|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Douglas Mawson]] and [[Xavier Mertz]] were part of the [[Far Eastern Party]], a three-man sledging team with [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis|Lieutenant B.E.S. Ninnis]], to survey King George V Land, Antarctica. On 14 December 1912 Ninnis fell through a snow-covered crevasse along with most of the party's rations, and was never seen again. Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one and a half weeks' food for themselves and nothing at all for the dogs. Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs on their {{convert|315|mi|km|adj=on}} return journey. Their meat was tough, stringy and without a vestige of fat. Each animal yielded very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs, which ate the meat, skin and bones until nothing remained. The men also ate the dog's brains and livers.

Dog meat is also believed to increase the body temperature, so people sweat more to keep one cool during the summer (the way of dealing with heat is called ''Heal heat with heat'' (\uc774\uc5f4\uce58\uc5f4, \u4ee5\u71b1\u6cbb\u71b1, ''i-yeol-chi-yeol'').

One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get fresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and [[pemmican]] the whole way, and this enabled them to do splendid work. And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The dogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from.

Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one and a half weeks' food for themselves and nothing at all for the dogs. Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs on their {{convert|315|mi|km|adj=on}} return journey. Their meat was tough, stringy and without a vestige of fat. Each animal yielded very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs, which ate the meat, skin and bones until nothing remained. The men also ate the dog's brains and livers. Unfortunately eating the liver of sled dogs produces the condition [[hypervitaminosis A]] because canines have a much higher tolerance for vitamin A than humans do.
