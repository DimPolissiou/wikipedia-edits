Number eleven and twelve are relegated. The winners of the two groups of the [[1. divisjon]] are promoted, as well as the winner of a series of play-off matches between the two second placed teams in the two groups of the 1. divisjon and number ten in the Tippeligaen.\n\nThe season began on April 27, 1991. The season ended on October 13, 1991, with [[Viking FK|Viking]] claiming their eighth league title. Viking were thus the last club to win the league before [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]]'s 13-year domination started.\n\n==Teams and locations==\n:''Note: Table lists in alphabetical order.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

season of top division [[association football|football]] in [[Norway]]. 22 game-weeks were played with 3 points given for wins and 1 for draws. Number eleven and twelve are relegated. The winners of the two groups of the [[1. divisjon]] are promoted, as well as the winner of a series of play-off matches between the two second placed teams in the two groups of the 1. divisjon and number ten in the Tippeligaen.\n\nThe season began on April 27, 1991. The season ended on October 13, 1991, with [[Viking FK|Viking]] claiming their eighth league title. Viking were thus the last club to win the league before [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]]'s 13-year domination started.\n\n==Teams and locations==\n:''Note: Table lists in alphabetical order.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

He was the [[List of premiers of the People's Republic of China|third]] [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]] from 1980 to 1987, [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] from 1981 to 1982, and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] from 1987 to 1989. He lost power in connection with the reformative [[Neoauthoritarianism (China)|neoauthoritarianism]] current and his support of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].\n\nAs a senior government official, Zhao was critical of [[Maoist]] policies and instrumental in implementing free-market reforms, first in [[Sichuan]] and subsequently nationwide. He emerged on the national scene due to support from [[Deng Xiaoping]] after the [[Cultural Revolution]]. An advocate of the privatization of state-owned enterprises, the separation of the party and the state, and general [[market economy|market economic]] reforms, he sought measures to streamline China's bureaucracy and fight corruption, issues that challenged the party's legitimacy in the 1980s. Many of these views were shared by the then [[Hu Yaobang|General Secretary Hu Yaobang]].<ref name=\"fudandaxue\">''Economic Reform in China'' by James A. Dorn, Xi Wang, Wang Xi</ref>\n\nHis economic reform policies and sympathies with student demonstrators during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] placed him at odds with some members of the party leadership, including Chairman of the [[Central Advisory Commission]] [[Chen Yun]], [[Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|Chairman of the CPPCC]] [[Li Xiannian]] and [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Peng]]. Zhao also began to lose favor with [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] [[Deng Xiaoping]]. In the aftermath of the events, Zhao was purged politically and effectively placed under [[house arrest]] for the rest of his life.\n\nHe died from a stroke in Beijing in January 2005. Because of his political fall from grace, he was not given the funeral rites generally accorded to senior Chinese officials. His secret autobiography was smuggled out and published in English and in Chinese in 2009, but the details of his life remain censored in China.\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Zhao ziyang and Maozedong.jpg|left|Zhao (top left) pictured with [[Mao Zedong]] in Wuhan, January 1966|thumb|150px]]\nZhao was born '''Zhao Xiuye''' ({{zh|s=\u8d75\u4fee\u4e1a |t=\u8d99\u4fee\u696d |p=Zh\u00e0o Xi\u016by\u00e8}}), but changed his given name to \"Ziyang\" while attending middle school in [[Wuhan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wh14.com/Article/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=1511 |language=zh-cn |script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u7b2c\u5341\u56db\u4e2d\u5b66\u6821\u53cb\u8d75\u7d2b\u9633}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512113906/http://www.wh14.com/Article/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=1511 |date=12 May 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=\u8d99\u851a |script-title=zh:\u8d99\u7d2b\u967d\u50b3 |year=1989 |publisher=\u4e2d\u570b\u65b0\u805e\u51fa\u7248\u793e |pages=4\u201312 |script-chapter=zh:\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ae0 \u6545\u9109\u3001\u5bb6\u4e16\u548c\u7ae5\u5e74 |language=zh}}</ref> He was the son of a wealthy landlord in [[Hua County, Henan|Hua County]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xzqh.org/QUHUA/41hn/0526hx.htm |script-title=zh:\u6ed1\u53bf\uff08Hua Xian) |accessdate=26 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103190348/http://www.xzqh.org/quhua/41hn/0526hx.htm |archivedate=3 January 2009 }}</ref> [[Henan]], who was later murdered by Communist Party officials during a land reform movement in the early 1940s.<ref name=\"independent\">Becker, Jasper.

He served in the [[People's Liberation Army]], which was integrated into the Republic of China's [[National Revolutionary Army]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and the subsequent [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]], but his posts were largely administrative.<ref name=\"NYT\" /> Zhao's career was not especially notable before he emerged as a Party leader in [[Guangdong]] in the early 1950s.<ref name=\"independent\" />\n\nZhao rose to prominence in [[Guangdong]] from 1951,<ref name=\"Newrop\" /> initially following a ruthless ultra-leftist, [[Tao Zhu]], who was notable for his heavy-handed efforts to force local peasants into living and working in \"People's Communes\". When [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958\u20131961) created an artificial famine, Mao publicly blamed the nation's food shortages on the greed of rich peasants, who were supposedly hiding China's huge surplus production from the government. Zhao's faith in Mao led him to take a leading role in a local campaign aimed at torturing peasants into revealing their imaginary food supplies. Through supporting the Great Leap Forward, Zhao was partially responsible for the millions of people who died from starvation and malnutrition in Guangdong between 1958 and 1961.<ref name=\"independent\" />\n\nZhao's experiences during the Great Leap Forward led him to support moderate political and economic policies, including those supported by [[Deng Xiaoping]] and President [[Liu Shaoqi]]. He led efforts to re-introduce limited amounts of private agriculture and commerce, and dismantled the People's Communes.<ref name=\"independent\" /> Zhao's methods of returning private plots to farmers and assigning production contracts to individual households were replicated in other parts of China, helping the country's agricultural sector recover.<ref name=\"NYT\" /> After achieving senior positions in Guangdong, Zhao directed a harsh purge of cadres accused of corruption or having ties to the [[Kuomintang]].<ref name=\"Newrop\" />\n\nBy 1965 Zhao was the Party secretary of [[Guangdong]] province, despite not being a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party Central Committee]].

He was dismissed from all official positions in 1967, after which he was paraded through [[Guangzhou]] in a [[dunce cap]]<ref name=\"independent\" /> and publicly denounced as \"a stinking remnant of the landlord class\".<ref name=\"Newrop\" />\n\n==Return to government==\nZhao spent four years as a [[Machinist|fitter]] in Hunan, at the Xianzhong Mechanics Factory. Zhao Wujun, the youngest of his four sons, worked with him (Zhao also had a younger daughter). While in political exile, Zhao's family lived in a small apartment close to his factory, with a small suitcase in the living room that served as a dinner table.<ref name=\"Adixii\" />\n\nZhao's rehabilitation began in April 1971, when he and his family were woken in the middle of the night by someone banging on the door. Without much explanation, the Party chief of the factory that Zhao was working at informed Zhao that he was to go at once to [[Changsha]], the provincial capital. The factory's only means of transport was a three-wheeled motorcycle, which was ready to take him.<ref name=\"Adixiii\">Ignatius, Adi. \"Preface\". In Zhao Ziyang.

Still unaware of what was happening, Zhao boarded the plane. He was checked into the comfortable [[Beijing Hotel]], but wasn't able to get to sleep: he later claimed that, after years of living in poverty, the mattress was too soft.<ref name=\"Adixiii\" />\n\nIn the morning, Zhao was taken to a meeting with Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] at the [[Great Hall of the People]]. Soon after they met, Zhao began a speech that he had prepared over the previous night: \"I have been rethinking the Cultural Revolution during these years as a labourer...\"  Zhou cut him off, saying \"You've been called to Beijing because the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] has decided to name you as a deputy Party chief of [[Inner Mongolia]].\"<ref name=\"Adixiii\" />\n\nAfter being recalled from political exile, Zhao attempted to portray himself as a born-again [[Maoism|Maoist]], and publicly renounced any interest in encouraging private enterprise or material incentive. Zhao's late conversion to Maoism did not last long, and he later became a \"principal architect\" of the sweeping, pro-market changes that followed the death of Mao. Despite his important role in guiding the economy of China over the course of his career, Zhao had no formal training in economics.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nThroughout 1972 Zhou Enlai directed Zhao's [[political rehabilitation]]. Zhao was appointed to the Central Committee, and in Inner Mongolia became the Revolutionary Committee Secretary and vice-chairman in March 1972. Zhao was elevated to the 10th Central Committee in August 1973, and returned to Guangdong as 1st CPC Secretary and Revolutionary Committee Chair in April 1974. He became Political Commissar of the Chengdu Military Region in December 1975.<ref>Editor. ''China Directory, 1979 Edition''. Radiopress, Inc (Tokyo), September 1978. p. 479</ref>\n\nZhao was appointed Party Secretary of [[Sichuan]] in 1975, effectively the province's highest-ranking official. Earlier in the Cultural Revolution, Sichuan had been notable for the violent battles that rival organizations of local Red Guards had fought against each other. At the time, Sichuan was China's most populous province,<ref name=\"independent\" /> but it had been economically devastated by the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, whose collective policies had collapsed the province's agricultural production to levels not seen since the 1930s, despite a great increase in the province's population.<ref>Bramall, Chris.

As premier, Zhao implemented many of the policies that were successful in Sichuan at a national scale, increasingly de-centralizing industrial and agricultural production.

In the late 1980s Hu and Zhao collaborated to promote a series of large-scale political reforms with vaguely defined goals. The political reforms of Hu and Zhao included proposals to have candidates directly elected to the Politburo, more elections with more than one candidate, more government transparency, more consultation with the public on policy, and increased personal responsibility directed to officials for their mistakes.<ref name=\"independent\" />\n\nZhao and Hu also began a large-scale anti-corruption programme, and permitted the investigations of the children of high-ranking Party elders, who had grown up protected by their parents' influence. Hu's investigation of Party officials belonging to this \"[[Crown Prince Party]]\" made Hu unpopular with many powerful Party officials. In January 1987 a clique of Party elders forced Hu to resign, on the grounds that he had been too lenient to student protestors. After Hu's dismissal, Deng promoted Zhao to replace Hu as CPC general secretary, putting Zhao in the position to succeed Deng as \"paramount leader\".<ref name=\"independent\" /> One month before Zhao was appointed to the position of general secretary, Zhao was interviewed by an American reporter, stating: \"I am not fit to be the general secretary...

This precipitated a political debate, which grew more heated through the winter of 1988 to 1989.<ref name=\"Newrop\" />\n\nZhao Ziyang vigorously opposed the participation of women in the Party and State's political processes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Judd |first1=Ellen R. |title=The Chinese Women\u2019s Movement |date=2002 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Private Collection |isbn=0-8047-4406-8 |page=175}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with party elders===\nBecause Zhao had risen to power through his work in the provinces, he never enjoyed strong connections among the Party leadership in Beijing. Because he had led the [[Communist Youth League]] in the 1950s, Zhao often relied on its former members for support, and Zhao's enemies accused him of promoting a [[Tuanpai|\"Communist Youth League faction\"]] within the CCP. Among Beijing's [[Eight Elders|Party elders]], [[Chen Yun]] and [[Li Xiannian]] were notably critical of Zhao and his policies.<ref name=\"Macxix\">MacFarquhar, Roderick.  \"Foreword\". In Zhao Ziyang, ''[[Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang]]''. New York, NY: Simon and Schuster. 2009. {{ISBN|1-4391-4938-0}}. p. xix.</ref>\n\nDespite his criticism of Zhao, Chen Yun was the Party elder most respected by Zhao, and Zhao would frequently attempt to consult with Chen before implementing new policies. Li Xiannian resented Zhao personally for Zhao's interest in foreign culture, and for Zhao's willingness to learn from economic models that had been successful outside of China. According to Zhao, Li Xiannian \"hated me because I was implementing Deng Xiaoping's reforms, but since it was difficult for him to openly oppose Deng, he made me the target of the opposition.\"<ref>MacFarquhar, Roderick.  \"Foreword\". In Zhao Ziyang, ''[[Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang]]''. New York, NY: Simon and Schuster. 2009. {{ISBN|1-4391-4938-0}}. pp. xviii\u2013xix.</ref>\n\nZhao wrote warmly of Hu Yaobang in his autobiography, and generally agreed with Hu on the direction of China's economic reforms. Although Deng Xiaoping was Zhao's only firm supporter among the Party elders, Deng's support was sufficient to protect Zhao throughout Zhao's career. As late as April 1989, one month before the dramatic end of Zhao's career, Deng assured Zhao that he had secured the support of Chen Yun and Li Xiannian for Zhao to serve two more full terms as Party general secretary.<ref name=\"Macxix\" />\n\nThe second half of 1988 saw the increasing deterioration of Zhao's political support. Zhao found himself in multi-front turf battles with the Party elders, who grew increasingly dissatisfied with Zhao's hands-off approach to ideological matters. The conservative faction in the politburo, led by Premier [[Li Peng]] and Vice-premier [[Yao Yilin]], were constantly at odds with Zhao in economic and fiscal policy making. Zhao was under growing pressure to combat runaway corruption by rank-and-file officials and their family members. In the beginning of 1989, it was evident that Zhao was faced with an increasingly difficult uphill battle, and he may have seen that he was fighting for his own political survival. If Zhao was unable to turn things around rapidly, a showdown with the Party conservatives would be all but inevitable.  The student protests triggered by the sudden death of former CPC general secretary Hu Yaobang, widely admired as a reform-minded leader, created a crisis in which Zhao was forced into a confrontation with his political enemies.\n\n==Tiananmen Square protests==\n{{Main|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989}}\nZhao was general secretary for little more than a year before the death of Hu Yaobang on 15 April 1989, which, coupled with a growing sense of public outrage caused by high inflation, provided the backdrop for the large-scale protest of 1989 by students, intellectuals, and other parts of a disaffected urban population. The Tiananmen protests initially began as a spontaneous public mourning for Hu, but evolved into nationwide protests supporting political reform and demanding an end to Party corruption.<ref name=\"independent\" />\n\nStudent demonstrators, taking advantage of the loosening political atmosphere, reacted to a variety of causes of discontent. The diverse demands of protesters included greater economic liberalization, political democracy, media freedom, freedom of speech and association, rule of law, and to have the legitimacy of the movement recognized. Some protest leaders spoke against [[Crown Prince Party|official corruption]] and speculation, price stability, social security, and the democratic means to supervise the reform process.<ref>[[Wang Hui (intellectual)|Wang Hui]].

Party hard-liners increasingly came to the conclusion that the demonstrations were due to Zhao's rapid pace of reform, which they believed caused a sense of confusion and frustration among college students. The protesters may have been encouraged by the imminent collapse of other Communist governments in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Newrop\" />\n\nZhao treated the protesters sympathetically. The protests may have died down, but on 26 April he was obliged (as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Party General Secretary]]) to leave for [[North Korea]] on a state visit. While he was away, Premier [[Li Peng]] organized a meeting between Deng Xiaoping and the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Standing Committee]], in which Li and his allies convinced Deng that the protests were threatening to the Party. Following the meeting, Li had the ''[[People's Daily]]'' publish [[April 26 Editorial|an article]] (which he attributed to Deng), which criticized the protests as \"premeditated and organized turmoil with anti-Party and anti-socialist motives.\" Following the publication of Li's article, the protests grew to over 10,000 and spread to cities across China,<ref name=\"Pomfret\">Pomfret, John.

He attempted to institute numerous government reforms, including the creation of a special commission to investigate government corruption; but, according to Zhao, the commission was ineffective because \"Li Peng and others in his group actively attempted to block, delay and even sabotage the process.\" Zhao attempted to arrange a meeting with Deng in order to convince him to retract Li's \"April 26 article\". Zhao was granted a meeting with Deng on 17 May; but, instead of the private meeting he expected, he found that the entire Standing Committee was present. When Zhao advocated modifying the editorial, President [[Yang Shangkun]] proposed declaring [[martial law]] according to the decision of [[National People's Congress]].<ref name=\"Pomfret\" /> Zhao refused to order the military to crush the demonstrations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pan, Philip P. \"Chapter One: The Public Funeral\" in ''Out of Mao's Shadow: The Struggle for the Soul of a New China''.</ref>\n\nDeng eventually decided on declaring martial law. According to [[the Tiananmen Papers]], the standing committee vote was split 2-2 with one abstention, and retired CCP veterans were called in to determine the vote. According to Zhao, there was no vote, and the decision to declare martial law was illegal according to the Party's rules.<ref name=\"Pomfret\" />\n\n===\u201cWe are already old, we do not matter any more\u201d===\nShortly before 5&nbsp;am on 19 May, Zhao appeared in Tiananmen Square and wandered among the crowd of protesters. Using a bullhorn, he delivered a now-famous speech to the students gathered at the square. It was first broadcast through [[China Central Television]] nationwide. Here is a translated version:\n{{cquote\n|Students, we came too late. We are sorry. You talk about us, criticize us, it is all necessary. The reason that I came here is not to ask for your forgiveness. What I want to say is that you are all getting weak, it has been seven days since you went on a hunger strike, you can't continue like this. As time goes on, your body will be damaged beyond repair, it could be very life-threatening. Now the most important thing is to end this strike. I know, your hunger strike is to hope that the Party and the government will give you a satisfying answer. I feel that our communication is open. Some of these problems can only be solved through certain procedures. For example, you have mentioned about the nature of the incident, the question of responsibility; I feel that those problems can be resolved eventually, we can reach a mutual agreement in the end. However, you should also know that the situation is very complicated, it is going to be a long process. You can't continue the hunger strike longer than seven days, and still insist on receiving a satisfying answer before ending the hunger strike.\n\nYou are still young, we are old, you must live healthy, and see the day when China accomplishes the [[Four Modernizations]]. You are not like us. '''We are already old, we do not matter anymore.''' It is not easy for this nation and your parents to support your college studies. Now you are all about 20, and about to sacrifice your lives so easily, students, couldn't you think rationally? Now the situation is very serious, you all know, the Party and the nation is very antsy, our society is very worried. Besides, Beijing is the capital, the situation is getting worse and worse everywhere, this cannot continue. Students, you all have good will, and are for the good of our nation, but if this situation continues, loses control, it will have serious consequences elsewhere.\n\nIn conclusion, I have only one wish. If you stop this hunger strike, the government won't close the door for dialogue, never! The questions that you have raised, we can continue to discuss. Although it is a little slow, but we are reaching some agreement on some problems. Today I just want to see the students, and express our feelings. I hope students could think about this issues calmly. This thing can not be sorted out clearly under illogical situations. You all have that strength, you are young after all. We were also young before, we protested, laid our bodies on the rail tracks, we never thought about what will happen in the future at that time. Finally, I beg the students once again, think about the future calmly. There are many things that can be solved. I hope that you will all end the hunger strike soon, thank you.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theasiamag.com/cheat-sheet/zhao-ziyangs-tiananmen-square-speech |title=Zhao Ziyang's Tiananmen Square speech |last=Chua |first=Dan-Chyi |date=February 2009 |periodical=Asia!

That was Zhao's last public appearance, for Zhao had been ousted by party elders just before coming to the square (when [[Deng Xiaoping]] ordered troops, Zhao turned in his resignation).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The phrase \"{{lang|zh-hans|\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u8001\u4e86\uff0c\u65e0\u6240\u8c13\u4e86}}\" ([[Traditional Chinese]]: \"{{lang|zh-hant|\u6211\u5011\u5df2\u7d93\u8001\u4e86\uff0c\u7121\u6240\u8b02\u4e86}}\") \u2013 \"We are already old, we do not matter any more\" \u2013 became a famous quotation after that.\n\n==House arrest==\nThe protesters did not disperse. A day after Zhao's 19 May visit to Tiananmen Square, Premier [[Li Peng]] publicly declared [[martial law]], leading to the deaths of hundreds to thousands of protesters on 4 June. In the power struggle that ensued, Zhao was stripped of all his positions and was put under house arrest. Following Zhao's dismissal, [[Jiang Zemin]] replaced Zhao as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] and successor of Deng Xiaoping.<ref name=\"independent\" />   Over thirty ministers were dismissed as Zhao loyalists, and Zhao was widely criticized in the Chinese media.<ref name=\"Du1\">Du Daozheng.

Some say he went into the square hoping a conciliatory gesture would gain him leverage against hard-liners like Premier Li Peng. Others believe he supported the protesters and did not want to see them hurt when the military was called in. After the incident, Zhao was placed under indefinite house arrest.<ref>Wu Guoguang.

According to Li, \"Zhao liaised with Bao Tong immediately after his arrival in Beijing (from Pyongyang). Bao gathered some other of Zhao's supporters to hash out the situation. They feared that Zhao's political future was at stake: Zhao did not succeed in [managing] the economy, was not stellar politically, does not have a power base of his own, and his son was suspected of illegal business dealings. As such, it was likely that Zhao would become the 'scapegoat' of the student movement.

There were occasional reports of him attending the funeral of a dead comrade, visiting other parts of China or playing golf at Beijing courses, but the government rather successfully kept him hidden from news reports and history books. Over that period, only a few [[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]s of a gray-haired Zhao leaked out to the media. On at least two occasions Zhao wrote letters, addressed to the Chinese government, in which he put forward the case for a reassessment of the Tiananmen Massacre. One of those letters appeared on the eve of the Communist Party's 15th National Congress. The other came during a 1998 visit to China by U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]. Neither was ever published in mainland China.\n\nAfter 1989, Zhao remained ideologically estranged from the Chinese government. He remained popular among those who believed that the government was wrong in ordering the Tiananmen Massacre, and that the Party should reassess its position on the student protests. He continued to hold China's top leadership responsible for the assault, and refused to accept the official Party line that the demonstrations had been a part of a \"counter-revolutionary rebellion\".<ref name=\"NYT\" /> After his arrest, Zhao eventually came to hold a number of beliefs that were much more radical than any positions he had ever expressed while in power. Zhao came to believe that China should adopt a free press, freedom to organize, an independent judiciary, and a multiparty parliamentary democracy.<ref name=\"Link\" />\n\nZhao lived for fifteen years under house arrest, accompanied by his wife.

The material in his biography was largely consistent with the information from the \"[[Tiananmen Papers]]\", an unauthorized collection of Chinese government documents published in 2001. The book was also consistent with material from \"Captive Conversations\", a record of conversations between Zhao and his friend Zong Fengming, which was published only in Chinese.<ref name=\"Link\" /> According to Zhao's friend and former co-worker, Du Daozheng, Zhao only recorded the tapes after being convinced by his friends to do so.<ref name=\"Du1\" />\n\n''Prisoner of the State'' contained minor historical errors, which commenters noted may reflect how out of touch China's leaders are with Chinese society. Although the Beijing populace did spontaneously attempt to block Chinese troops' entrance into Beijing, Zhao's assertion that \"groups of old ladies and children slept in the roads\" was not correct. Zhao noted that the astrophysicist [[Fang Lizhi]] (the Chinese government's most wanted dissident following the Tiananmen Protests) was out of the country in 1989 and publicly critical of Deng Xiaoping, when in fact Fang was living just outside Beijing and deliberately kept silent about politics during the 1989 protests.<ref name=\"Link\" />\n\nAs of 2009 his memoir was being sold (in both Chinese and English) in Hong Kong but not in mainland China, though a [[Microsoft Word]] document containing the memoir's entire Chinese-language text became available on the Internet and was downloaded widely throughout mainland China.\n\nThe recordings highlighted Zhao's heavy Henan accent ([[Central Plains Mandarin]]), making his [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] at times hard to follow.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Ching\n  | first = Frank\n  | title = Another tongue that's not so common after all\n  | newspaper = SCMP\n  | location = Hong Kong\n  | date = 9 August 2010\n  | url = http://www.scmp.com/article/721717/another-tongue-thats-not-so-common-after-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|Biography}}\n* [[Politics of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[History of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading==\n* Bachman, David. \"Differing visions of China's post-Mao economy: the ideas of Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhao Ziyang.\" ''Asian Survey'' 26.3 (1986): 292-321.\n* Donnithorne, Audrey. \"Prolonged Readjustment: Zhao Ziyang on Current Economic Policy.\" ''Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs'' 8 (1982): 111-126.\n* Ji, You. \"Zhao Ziyang and the politics of inflation.\" ''Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs'' 25 (1991): 69-91.\n* Lam, Willy Wo-Lap.

high-ranking statesman in the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]]. He was the [[List of premiers of the People's Republic of China|third]] [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]] from 1980 to 1987, [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] from 1981 to 1982, and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] from 1987 to 1989. He lost power in connection with the reformative [[Neoauthoritarianism (China)|neoauthoritarianism]] current and his support of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].\n\nAs a senior government official, Zhao was critical of [[Maoist]] policies and instrumental in implementing free-market reforms, first in [[Sichuan]] and subsequently nationwide. He emerged on the national scene due to support from [[Deng Xiaoping]] after the [[Cultural Revolution]]. An advocate of the privatization of state-owned enterprises, the separation of the party and the state, and general [[market economy|market economic]] reforms, he sought measures to streamline China's bureaucracy and fight corruption, issues that challenged the party's legitimacy in the 1980s. Many of these views were shared by the then [[Hu Yaobang|General Secretary Hu Yaobang]].<ref name=\"fudandaxue\">''Economic Reform in China'' by James A. Dorn, Xi Wang, Wang Xi</ref>\n\nHis economic reform policies and sympathies with student demonstrators during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] placed him at odds with some members of the party leadership, including Chairman of the [[Central Advisory Commission]] [[Chen Yun]], [[Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|Chairman of the CPPCC]] [[Li Xiannian]] and [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Peng]]. Zhao also began to lose favor with [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] [[Deng Xiaoping]]. In the aftermath of the events, Zhao was purged politically and effectively placed under [[house arrest]] for the rest of his life.\n\nHe died from a stroke in Beijing in January 2005. Because of his political fall from grace, he was not given the funeral rites generally accorded to senior Chinese officials. His secret autobiography was smuggled out and published in English and in Chinese in 2009, but the details of his life remain censored in China.\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Zhao ziyang and Maozedong.jpg|left|Zhao (top left) pictured with [[Mao Zedong]] in Wuhan, January 1966|thumb|150px]]\nZhao was born '''Zhao Xiuye''' ({{zh|s=\u8d75\u4fee\u4e1a |t=\u8d99\u4fee\u696d |p=Zh\u00e0o Xi\u016by\u00e8}}), but changed his given name to \"Ziyang\" while attending middle school in [[Wuhan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wh14.com/Article/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=1511 |language=zh-cn |script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u7b2c\u5341\u56db\u4e2d\u5b66\u6821\u53cb\u8d75\u7d2b\u9633}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512113906/http://www.wh14.com/Article/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=1511 |date=12 May 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=\u8d99\u851a |script-title=zh:\u8d99\u7d2b\u967d\u50b3 |year=1989 |publisher=\u4e2d\u570b\u65b0\u805e\u51fa\u7248\u793e |pages=4\u201312 |script-chapter=zh:\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ae0 \u6545\u9109\u3001\u5bb6\u4e16\u548c\u7ae5\u5e74 |language=zh}}</ref> He was the son of a wealthy landlord in [[Hua County, Henan|Hua County]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xzqh.org/QUHUA/41hn/0526hx.htm |script-title=zh:\u6ed1\u53bf\uff08Hua Xian) |accessdate=26 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103190348/http://www.xzqh.org/quhua/41hn/0526hx.htm |archivedate=3 January 2009 }}</ref> [[Henan]], who was later murdered by Communist Party officials during a land reform movement in the early 1940s.<ref name=\"independent\">Becker, Jasper.

He served in the [[People's Liberation Army]], which was integrated into the Republic of China's [[National Revolutionary Army]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and the subsequent [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]], but his posts were largely administrative.<ref name=\"NYT\" /> Zhao's career was not especially notable before he emerged as a Party leader in [[Guangdong]] in the early 1950s.<ref name=\"independent\" />\n\nZhao rose to prominence in [[Guangdong]] from 1951,<ref name=\"Newrop\" /> initially following a ruthless ultra-leftist, [[Tao Zhu]], who was notable for his heavy-handed efforts to force local peasants into living and working in \"People's Communes\". When [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958\u20131961) created an artificial famine, Mao publicly blamed the nation's food shortages on the greed of rich peasants, who were supposedly hiding China's huge surplus production from the government. Zhao's faith in Mao led him to take a leading role in a local campaign aimed at torturing peasants into revealing their imaginary food supplies. Through supporting the Great Leap Forward, Zhao was partially responsible for the millions of people who died from starvation and malnutrition in Guangdong between 1958 and 1961.<ref name=\"independent\" />\n\nZhao's experiences during the Great Leap Forward led him to support moderate political and economic policies, including those supported by [[Deng Xiaoping]] and President [[Liu Shaoqi]]. He led efforts to re-introduce limited amounts of private agriculture and commerce, and dismantled the People's Communes.<ref name=\"independent\" /> Zhao's methods of returning private plots to farmers and assigning production contracts to individual households were replicated in other parts of China, helping the country's agricultural sector recover.<ref name=\"NYT\" /> After achieving senior positions in Guangdong, Zhao directed a harsh purge of cadres accused of corruption or having ties to the [[Kuomintang]].<ref name=\"Newrop\" />\n\nBy 1965 Zhao was the Party secretary of [[Guangdong]] province, despite not being a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party Central Committee]].

Still unaware of what was happening, Zhao boarded the plane. He was checked into the comfortable [[Beijing Hotel]], but wasn't able to get to sleep: he later claimed that, after years of living in poverty, the mattress was too soft.<ref name=\"Adixiii\" />\n\nIn the morning, Zhao was taken to a meeting with Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] at the [[Great Hall of the People]]. Soon after they met, Zhao began a speech that he had prepared over the previous night: \"I have been rethinking the Cultural Revolution during these years as a labourer...\"  Zhou cut him off, saying \"You've been called to Beijing because the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] has decided to name you as a deputy Party chief of [[Inner Mongolia]].\"<ref name=\"Adixiii\" />\n\nAfter being recalled from political exile, Zhao attempted to portray himself as a born-again [[Maoism|Maoist]], and publicly renounced any interest in encouraging private enterprise or material incentive. Zhao's late conversion to Maoism did not last long, and he later became a \"principal architect\" of the sweeping, pro-market changes that followed the death of Mao. Despite his important role in guiding the economy of China over the course of his career, Zhao had no formal training in economics.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nThroughout 1972 Zhou Enlai directed Zhao's [[political rehabilitation]]. Zhao was appointed to the Central Committee, and in Inner Mongolia became the Revolutionary Committee Secretary and vice-chairman in March 1972. Zhao was elevated to the 10th Central Committee in August 1973, and returned to Guangdong as 1st CPC Secretary and Revolutionary Committee Chair in April 1974.

Earlier in the Cultural Revolution, Sichuan had been notable for the violent battles that rival organizations of local Red Guards had fought against each other. At the time, Sichuan was China's most populous province,<ref name=\"independent\" /> but it had been economically devastated by the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, whose collective policies had collapsed the province's agricultural production to levels not seen since the 1930s, despite a great increase in the province's population.<ref>Bramall, Chris.

In the late 1980s Hu and Zhao collaborated to promote a series of large-scale political reforms with vaguely defined goals. The political reforms of Hu and Zhao included proposals to have candidates directly elected to the Politburo, more elections with more than one candidate, more government transparency, more consultation with the public on policy, and increased personal responsibility directed to officials for their mistakes.<ref name=\"independent\" />\n\nZhao and Hu also began a large-scale anti-corruption programme, and permitted the investigations of the children of high-ranking Party elders, who had grown up protected by their parents' influence. Hu's investigation of Party officials belonging to this \"[[Crown Prince Party]]\" made Hu unpopular with many powerful Party officials. In January 1987 a clique of Party elders forced Hu to resign, on the grounds that he had been too lenient to student protestors. After Hu's dismissal, Deng promoted Zhao to replace Hu as CPC general secretary, putting Zhao in the position to succeed Deng as \"paramount leader\".<ref name=\"independent\" /> One month before Zhao was appointed to the position of general secretary, Zhao was interviewed by an American reporter, stating: \"I am not fit to be the general secretary...

Because he had led the [[Communist Youth League]] in the 1950s, Zhao often relied on its former members for support, and Zhao's enemies accused him of promoting a [[Tuanpai|\"Communist Youth League faction\"]] within the CCP. Among Beijing's [[Eight Elders|Party elders]], [[Chen Yun]] and [[Li Xiannian]] were notably critical of Zhao and his policies.<ref name=\"Macxix\">MacFarquhar, Roderick.  \"Foreword\".

Li Xiannian resented Zhao personally for Zhao's interest in foreign culture, and for Zhao's willingness to learn from economic models that had been successful outside of China. According to Zhao, Li Xiannian \"hated me because I was implementing Deng Xiaoping's reforms, but since it was difficult for him to openly oppose Deng, he made me the target of the opposition.\"<ref>MacFarquhar, Roderick.  \"Foreword\".

Although Deng Xiaoping was Zhao's only firm supporter among the Party elders, Deng's support was sufficient to protect Zhao throughout Zhao's career. As late as April 1989, one month before the dramatic end of Zhao's career, Deng assured Zhao that he had secured the support of Chen Yun and Li Xiannian for Zhao to serve two more full terms as Party general secretary.<ref name=\"Macxix\" />\n\nThe second half of 1988 saw the increasing deterioration of Zhao's political support. Zhao found himself in multi-front turf battles with the Party elders, who grew increasingly dissatisfied with Zhao's hands-off approach to ideological matters. The conservative faction in the politburo, led by Premier [[Li Peng]] and Vice-premier [[Yao Yilin]], were constantly at odds with Zhao in economic and fiscal policy making. Zhao was under growing pressure to combat runaway corruption by rank-and-file officials and their family members. In the beginning of 1989, it was evident that Zhao was faced with an increasingly difficult uphill battle, and he may have seen that he was fighting for his own political survival. If Zhao was unable to turn things around rapidly, a showdown with the Party conservatives would be all but inevitable.  The student protests triggered by the sudden death of former CPC general secretary Hu Yaobang, widely admired as a reform-minded leader, created a crisis in which Zhao was forced into a confrontation with his political enemies.\n\n==Tiananmen Square protests==\n{{Main|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989}}\nZhao was general secretary for little more than a year before the death of Hu Yaobang on 15 April 1989, which, coupled with a growing sense of public outrage caused by high inflation, provided the backdrop for the large-scale protest of 1989 by students, intellectuals, and other parts of a disaffected urban population. The Tiananmen protests initially began as a spontaneous public mourning for Hu, but evolved into nationwide protests supporting political reform and demanding an end to Party corruption.<ref name=\"independent\" />\n\nStudent demonstrators, taking advantage of the loosening political atmosphere, reacted to a variety of causes of discontent. The diverse demands of protesters included greater economic liberalization, political democracy, media freedom, freedom of speech and association, rule of law, and to have the legitimacy of the movement recognized. Some protest leaders spoke against [[Crown Prince Party|official corruption]] and speculation, price stability, social security, and the democratic means to supervise the reform process.<ref>[[Wang Hui (intellectual)|Wang Hui]].

Party hard-liners increasingly came to the conclusion that the demonstrations were due to Zhao's rapid pace of reform, which they believed caused a sense of confusion and frustration among college students. The protesters may have been encouraged by the imminent collapse of other Communist governments in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Newrop\" />\n\nZhao treated the protesters sympathetically. The protests may have died down, but on 26 April he was obliged (as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Party General Secretary]]) to leave for [[North Korea]] on a state visit. While he was away, Premier [[Li Peng]] organized a meeting between Deng Xiaoping and the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Standing Committee]], in which Li and his allies convinced Deng that the protests were threatening to the Party. Following the meeting, Li had the ''[[People's Daily]]'' publish [[April 26 Editorial|an article]] (which he attributed to Deng), which criticized the protests as \"premeditated and organized turmoil with anti-Party and anti-socialist motives.\" Following the publication of Li's article, the protests grew to over 10,000 and spread to cities across China,<ref name=\"Pomfret\">Pomfret, John.

He attempted to institute numerous government reforms, including the creation of a special commission to investigate government corruption; but, according to Zhao, the commission was ineffective because \"Li Peng and others in his group actively attempted to block, delay and even sabotage the process.\" Zhao attempted to arrange a meeting with Deng in order to convince him to retract Li's \"April 26 article\". Zhao was granted a meeting with Deng on 17 May; but, instead of the private meeting he expected, he found that the entire Standing Committee was present.

According to [[the Tiananmen Papers]], the standing committee vote was split 2-2 with one abstention, and retired CCP veterans were called in to determine the vote.

Using a bullhorn, he delivered a now-famous speech to the students gathered at the square. It was first broadcast through [[China Central Television]] nationwide. Here is a translated version:\n{{cquote\n|Students, we came too late. We are sorry. You talk about us, criticize us, it is all necessary. The reason that I came here is not to ask for your forgiveness. What I want to say is that you are all getting weak, it has been seven days since you went on a hunger strike, you can't continue like this. As time goes on, your body will be damaged beyond repair, it could be very life-threatening. Now the most important thing is to end this strike. I know, your hunger strike is to hope that the Party and the government will give you a satisfying answer. I feel that our communication is open. Some of these problems can only be solved through certain procedures. For example, you have mentioned about the nature of the incident, the question of responsibility; I feel that those problems can be resolved eventually, we can reach a mutual agreement in the end. However, you should also know that the situation is very complicated, it is going to be a long process. You can't continue the hunger strike longer than seven days, and still insist on receiving a satisfying answer before ending the hunger strike.\n\nYou are still young, we are old, you must live healthy, and see the day when China accomplishes the [[Four Modernizations]]. You are not like us. '''We are already old, we do not matter anymore.''' It is not easy for this nation and your parents to support your college studies. Now you are all about 20, and about to sacrifice your lives so easily, students, couldn't you think rationally? Now the situation is very serious, you all know, the Party and the nation is very antsy, our society is very worried. Besides, Beijing is the capital, the situation is getting worse and worse everywhere, this cannot continue. Students, you all have good will, and are for the good of our nation, but if this situation continues, loses control, it will have serious consequences elsewhere.\n\nIn conclusion, I have only one wish. If you stop this hunger strike, the government won't close the door for dialogue, never! The questions that you have raised, we can continue to discuss. Although it is a little slow, but we are reaching some agreement on some problems. Today I just want to see the students, and express our feelings. I hope students could think about this issues calmly. This thing can not be sorted out clearly under illogical situations. You all have that strength, you are young after all. We were also young before, we protested, laid our bodies on the rail tracks, we never thought about what will happen in the future at that time. Finally, I beg the students once again, think about the future calmly. There are many things that can be solved.

A day after Zhao's 19 May visit to Tiananmen Square, Premier [[Li Peng]] publicly declared [[martial law]], leading to the deaths of hundreds to thousands of protesters on 4 June. In the power struggle that ensued, Zhao was stripped of all his positions and was put under house arrest. Following Zhao's dismissal, [[Jiang Zemin]] replaced Zhao as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] and successor of Deng Xiaoping.<ref name=\"independent\" />   Over thirty ministers were dismissed as Zhao loyalists, and Zhao was widely criticized in the Chinese media.<ref name=\"Du1\">Du Daozheng.

They feared that Zhao's political future was at stake: Zhao did not succeed in [managing] the economy, was not stellar politically, does not have a power base of his own, and his son was suspected of illegal business dealings.

There were occasional reports of him attending the funeral of a dead comrade, visiting other parts of China or playing golf at Beijing courses, but the government rather successfully kept him hidden from news reports and history books. Over that period, only a few [[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]s of a gray-haired Zhao leaked out to the media. On at least two occasions Zhao wrote letters, addressed to the Chinese government, in which he put forward the case for a reassessment of the Tiananmen Massacre. One of those letters appeared on the eve of the Communist Party's 15th National Congress. The other came during a 1998 visit to China by U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]].

He remained popular among those who believed that the government was wrong in ordering the Tiananmen Massacre, and that the Party should reassess its position on the student protests. He continued to hold China's top leadership responsible for the assault, and refused to accept the official Party line that the demonstrations had been a part of a \"counter-revolutionary rebellion\".<ref name=\"NYT\" /> After his arrest, Zhao eventually came to hold a number of beliefs that were much more radical than any positions he had ever expressed while in power.

On the day of his funeral, state television mentioned Zhao's death for the first time.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F.

She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]].

In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

Founded in 1552 and received its first Royal Charter in 1553, Christ's Hospital follows much of the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] tradition. Since its establishment, Christ's Hospital has been a [[charity school]], with a core aim to offer children from humble backgrounds the chance of a better education. It is widely recognized as one of the most prestigious boarding schools in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Charitable foundation==\n[[File:quad DH.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Christ's Hospital quad towards dining hall. Picture taken from Big School]]\nChrist's Hospital is almost unique for a British independent school in that the majority of the students receive bursaries. This stems from its founding charter as a charitable school. School fees are paid on a [[Means test|means-tested]] basis, with substantial subsidies paid by the school or their benefactors, so that pupils from all walks of life are able to have private education that would otherwise be beyond the means of their parents.\n\n[[File:CH FntAvQuad.jpg|thumb|left|Westward photo of Quad and Front Avenue. (View from Art School)]]\n\nThe trustees of the foundation are the Council of Almoners, chaired by the Treasurer of Christ's Hospital, who govern the foundation according to a Scheme of Administration granted by the [[Charity Commission]]. The historic Court of Governors survives as a formal institution consisting of over 650 benefactors but its powers have since the 19th century been largely transferred to the smaller Council of Almoners.\n\nIn 2007 Christ's Hospital was formally separated into two related [[Charitable organization|registered charities]]: Christ's Hospital Foundation<ref>{{EW charity|306975|CHRIST'S HOSPITAL FOUNDATION}}</ref> and Christ's Hospital School.<ref>{{EW charity|1120090|CHRIST'S HOSPITAL SCHOOL}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Christ's Hospital, engraved by Toms c.1770..jpg|thumb|Christ's Hospital's buildings in London in 1770]]\n[[File:Edward VI of England c. 1546.jpg|left|thumb|[[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]]]\nChrist's Hospital was the result of the foundation by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and confirmed by [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], assisted by [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]], Bishop of London, and Sir Richard Dobbs, [[Lord Mayor of London]].<ref>Thornbury, Walter. \"Christ's Hospital.\" ''Old and New London'': Volume 2.

Retrieved 18 June 2019. \n</ref> Its genesis was the earlier [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of the monasteries]] and the resultant overflow onto the streets of the poor and destitute. Encouraged by a sermon from Ridley, exhorting mercy to the poor, the King wrote to the Lord Mayor encouraging him to action. This he did via a committee of 30 merchants. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had already granted the use of Greyfriars to the City for the relief of the poor and to house the homeless children which the magistrates had taken notice of.<ref>Nichols, John Gough. (1851). ''Chronicle of the Grey Friars of London''. London: Printed for the Camden Society by J.B. Nichols and Son, Printers. 'Preface' xxvi-xxvii. [https://archive.org/details/ChronicleOfTheGreyFriarsOfLondon/page/n1 The Internet Archive website] Retrieved 18 June 2019.</ref> Edward granted [[Bridewell Palace]], his lands at the [[Savoy Palace|Savoy]], and rents and other chattels to create three Royal Hospitals \u2014 Bridewell Hospital (now the [[King Edward's School, Witley]], [[Surrey]]), [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and Christ's Hospital, which was for the education of poor children.\n\nThe first boys and girls entered the school in [[Newgate]] in 1552. The [[Royal Charter]] was granted and signed by its founder, Edward VI, the following year. The first treasurer was [[Richard Grafton]]. The Protestant foundation survived the [[Mary I of England|Marian]] period and in the 1560s it sent its first scholars to Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe school occupied Newgate as its major site for 350 years, but from time to time children were housed in other parts of the country. 32 children perished during the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague of 1665]]. In the following year the [[Great Fire of London]] destroyed much of the Hospital, except four cloisters and three wards, but there were no casualties among the children. Around 200 pupils were sent to Islington and Clerkenwell and then to Ware and Hertford.\n\nBy the end of the 17th century the buildings had been rebuilt with the assistance of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]], a governor of Christ's Hospital, and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], who designed the Writing School (1696). The church of [[Christ Church Greyfriars|Christ Church, Newgate Street]], designed by Wren, replaced the damaged choir of the former Greyfriars' church and served as a place of worship for the children of Christ's Hospital in the City until the move to Horsham. Through the will of the royal jeweller, [[George Heriot]], it also became the inspiration for the foundation of [[George Heriot's School|George Heriot's Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]], which was the first of the \"Hospital Schools\" to be founded in Scotland.\n\nChrist's Hospital was given its second [[royal charter]] by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1673. This specifically created the [[Royal Mathematical School]], the original purpose of which was to train [[mathematics|mathematicians]] and [[navigation|navigators]] who would serve as naval officers and merchant seafarers. [[Samuel Pepys]], Secretary to His Majesty's Navy and from 1699 Vice-President of Christ's Hospital, made a considerable contribution to Christ's Hospital. [[Isaac Newton]], [[Jonas Moore]], [[John Flamsteed]], and  [[Edmund Halley]] contributed to plans for the course of study of the new school within the foundation.\n\n[[File:Blue Coat School Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|This early 19th-century picture shows the Great Hall on St. Matthew's Day, 21 September. On this day, two Grecians destined for scholarships to Oxford and Cambridge Universities gave orations in praise of the school, one in [[Latin]] and the other in English. The [[Antonio Verrio|Verrio]] painting can be seen along the wall on the right.]]\n\nThe girls of the hospital settled at [[Hertford]] from 1707. The governors had been paying a teacher in Hertford from 1653, and the removal of some children from London following the Great Fire strengthened the link with the town. In 1761, 200 boys under the age of ten along with the boys from Ware were relocated to Hertford. In 1778 the last girls were moved out of London to join the others at Hertford, where the school was rebuilt 1795\u20131798 to provide accommodation for the new numbers.\n\nChrist's Hospital's most famous upper master was [[James Boyer]] who presided from 1778 to 1799 and instructed [[James Leigh Hunt]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].\n\nIn November 1815 the \u201cmost infamous Regency [[flagellant]]\u201d, an MP named [[Eyre Coote (British Army officer)|Sir Eyre Coote,]] entered Christ's Hospital mathematical school, sent away the younger boys and paid the older ones for a session of mutual flogging. The school nurse arrived to find him buttoning his breeches; England's satirical press had come of age in time to make the very most of such a moment. Coote endured a cartoon<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1646990&partId=1|title=A peep into the blue coat school !!!!!!!!!!!-|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref> by [[George Cruikshank]], a vaunted caricaturist, and national humiliation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/05/25/sex-drugs-and-the-birth-of-modernity|title=Sex, drugs and the birth of modernity|date=2019-05-23|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-06-02|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\nTwo of 19th-century London's most notable architects, [[John Shaw Sr.|John Shaw Senior]] and [[John Shaw Jr|John Shaw Junior]], were architects and surveyors to Christ's Hospital throughout the first half of the 1800s. The Shaws' work included the old school hall (c.1825).\n\n[[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]] started a tradition of Royal Presidents in 1854.\n\nA commission of inquiry in 1837 proposed reforms, and in 1864 the Taunton Commission investigated the endowed schools. As a result of this a greater number of girls were admitted. However, in the 1890s boys still outnumbered girls at Hertford.\n\nAnother commission in 1877 proposed a new site for the school, where all the boys would be taught. This proposal  was questioned by some of the Governors. The Duke of Cambridge said \"I am one of those who are perfectly prepared to go with the spirit of the age in which we live, but I confess that I am also one of those who do not love change for change\u2019s sake. To upset an old and long standing institution... is a very dangerous experiment to try.\"\n\nHowever, the proposal was carried out. {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} of land outside Horsham in Sussex was purchased from the Aylesbury Dairy Company for \u00a347,500. The foundation stone was laid by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] on 23 October 1897, on behalf of the Sovereign, the date being the anniversary of the birthday of the founder. Architectural features from the old school buildings (the Grecians' Arch and the Wren Arch) were salvaged and incorporated in the new buildings.\n\nThe boys were relocated from Newgate and Hertford to the new site in 1902. Hertford became a girls-only school.\n\nOver the centuries Christ's Hospital has continued to enjoy royal patronage. In 1919, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] became the first Royal Patron, followed by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] in 1937 and HM [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] in 1953.\n\n==Traditions==\n[[File:Constant Lambert as a Blue coat boy.jpg|thumb|The composer [[Constant Lambert]] as a pupil, wearing the traditional uniform]]\nLinks with the City and the [[Lord Mayor of London]] are well maintained, with an annual parade through the City of London on [[Matthew the Evangelist|St. Matthew's Day]] and a regular place in the [[Lord Mayor's Show]].\n\nOne of the Christ's Hospital traditions is marching into lunch with the band, which is done each day except Sunday, weather permitting.\n\nAnother is the annual speech-day parade, where the Lord Mayor of London and his procession watch the school perform a march-past through the main quad. They also join the school in chapel for a grand service, and eat lunch with the Grecian year and their parents. Lastly they move to Big School to hear the Senior Grecian's oration and witness the Grecian prize-giving. This is held on the Saturday at the start of the Summer Half Term.\n\n===Uniform===\nThe school's  Tudor [[school uniform|uniform]] consists of belted, long blue coats, knee-breeches, yellow socks, and [[bands (neckwear)|bands]] at the neck. The uniform has been in place since 1553.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stow|first=John|editor=Thoms, William J.|title=A Survey of London, written in the year 1598 by John Stow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vA9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA119|edition=New edition, 1842 |year=1598|publisher=Whittaker|page=119}}</ref> The nickname \"Blue-coat School\" comes from the blue coats worn by the students; however, the nickname used within the school community itself is \"Housey\" and the long coat is called a \"Housey coat\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/visitor-information/Documents/29-records-of-christs-hospital-and-bluecoat-schools.pdf |format=PDF |title=London Metropolitan Archives : Information Leaflet Number 29 : Records of Christ's Hospital and Bluecoats Schools |website=Cityoflondon.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref>\n\nSecond and third form pupils wear a simple leather belt with a buckle.

This consists of a knee-length pleated skirt, summer jacket, yellow socks (for the boys and junior girls), and grey socks or grey/black tights for senior girls, as well as the long coat in winter, and the bands.\n\nIn 2011 students and alumni stated that they saw the uniform as an important way of giving the school a unique identity and unifying the school. Around that time the administrators had discussed the idea of updating the uniform. Over 95% of students voted in favour of keeping the original uniform.<ref name=\"Unifvote\">\"Students Vote to Keep Tudor Uniform.\" British Heritage 32, no. 2 (May 2011): 10.

The school was rated 'excellent' (the top grade) in the report released in January 2013. The optional term 'Exceptional' was not used. The report also noted: \"The school is advised to make the following improvement.

Famous alumni of Christ's Hospital Music School include conductors Sir [[Colin Davis]], [[Charles Hazlewood]], [[Adrian Bawtree]], and Simon Joly, trumpeter [[David Mason (trumpet player)|David Mason]] (formerly Principal Trumpet of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra), composer [[Tim Benjamin]], and composer and conductor [[Constant Lambert]].\n\nThe school's chapel has a large five-manual [[Rushworth and Dreaper]] organ, one of four organs in the School (the others being a 3-manual 1829 Hill in Big School, played on by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and [[Karg-Elert]], a 2-manual [[Henry Willis & Sons|Father Willis]] in the Dining Hall, and a Flight and Robson chamber organ in the Court Room). The near 150-strong Chapel Choir has made many recordings and through these has earned an excellent reputation.\n\nThroughout the school's history, many musically gifted pupils have gone on to take up choral and organ scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge universities or have gained places at leading music conservatories. The school has a Symphony Orchestra and many other smaller choirs and instrumental ensembles, along with an annual House Singing Competition. The Music Department organises a concert every February at [[St John's, Smith Square]] in London. The school is also famous as the first place in England to host a complete cycle of the chamber music of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], under the direction of the then Head of Piano [[John Thwaites (musician)|John Thwaites]].\n\nChrist's Hospital was featured in the first series of the reality television programme ''[[Rock School]]'', in which [[Gene Simmons]] of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] helped a group of pupils form their own rock band.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/rock_school/series_about.jhtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017211313/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/rock_school/series_about.jhtml |date=17 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lord Mayor's Show 2008 Christ's Hospital.jpg|thumb|The [[Christ's Hospital Band]] participating in the Lord Mayor's Show in 2008]]\n\nThe school's most famous ensemble is its marching band, simply named [[Christ's Hospital Band]].

Leigh Hunt was originally the pair of preparatory houses, Prep A and Prep B, and were converted to junior houses on the abolition in 1964 of entry at the age of nine.\n\nThe sixteen original houses provided two dormitories (Upper Dorm and Lower Dorm) sleeping up to about 30 boys each. As the merger of the boys and girls approached, some dormitories were divided into cubicles, and subsequent developments created dormitories accommodating about twelve pupils each. Since 2001 there has been a rolling refurbishment programme, with the refurbished houses providing a range of accommodation: four-bed rooms for the junior pupils to one-bed rooms for the more senior pupils.\n\nUntil 1964, boys at Horsham lived in all-through houses from 2nd Form to Grecians (with the exception of Prep A and Prep B). Then houses were divided into senior houses (Peele, Thornton, Middleton, Coleridge and Lamb) and Junior houses (Barnes, Maine, Leigh Hunt) with boys transferring to a senior house after Little Erasmus. In conjunction with the merger, a further reorganisation occurred with each house converting to a senior side and a junior side. This system reverted to the all-through houses in 2000, now from 2nd Form to Deps.\n\n=== Grecians houses===\n\nYear 13 (Grecian) students move to Grecians houses, which provide a transitional style of life in preparation for university or life beyond school. The two Grecians houses were completed early in 2001 and have individual study bedrooms plus several general common rooms and kitchenettes shared by a group of seven to ten pupils.<ref>http://www.christs-hospital.org.uk/parents-handbook-dec09.pdf</ref> allowed them to prepare to live in mixed communal environment as they prepare themselves for university education.\n\n*Grecians West (for pupils who were previously in Peele, Thornton, Middleton, and Coleridge)\n*Grecians East (for pupils who were previously in Lamb, Barnes, Maine, and Leigh Hunt)\n\n==Controversies ==\n===Sexual abuse ===\nSexual abuse of pupils from 1969 to 2001<ref name=\"bbc20180713\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-44817719|title=Christ's Hospital School teacher jailed for pupil rape|author=|date=13 July 2018|website=BBC News}}</ref> led to six former teachers being convicted of offences after more than 20 former students made complaints to the police in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-44654838|title=Teacher guilty of raping pupil|date=5 July 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/16353070.teacher-james-husband-from-york-jailed-for-17-years-for-raping-pupil|title=Teacher James Husband, from York, jailed for 17 years for raping pupil|date=13 July 2018|work=York Press|access-date=2018-07-13}}</ref> The convicted former teachers were sentenced to prison terms of up to 17 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-44817719|title=Christ's Hospital School teacher jailed for pupil rape|date=13 July 2018|website=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Alumni==\n{{See|List of people educated at Christ's Hospital}}\nPeople educated at Christ's Hospital are called Old Blues.\n\n==Staff==\nNotable members of staff have included:\n*[[Edward Baldwin, 4th Earl Baldwin of Bewdley]]\n*[[Adrian Bawtree]]\n*[[Edward Buck (rower)|Edward Buck]]\n*[[Samuel Cobb (poet)|Samuel Cobb]]\n*[[Gerald Davies]]\n*[[Ralph Henry Carless Davis]]\n*[[John Flamsteed]] ([[Astronomer Royal]])\n*[[William Hamilton Fyfe]]\n*[[Steve Gatting]]\n*[[Bruce Grindlay]]\n*[[George Andrew Jacob]]\n*[[Craig Sellar Lang]]\n*[[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harrison |first1=Derek |title=Derrick Somerset Macnutt |url=http://www.crossword.org.uk/ximenes.htm |website=www.crossword.org.uk |accessdate=18 December 2018}}</ref>\n*[[William Wales (astronomer)]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|West Sussex|London|Schools}}\n*[[Christ's Hospital Band]]\n*[[Christ's Hospital railway station]]\n*[[Erasmus Smith]]\n*[[List of Victoria Crosses by school]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last1=Davies-Jenkins|first1=Sue|title=Hang on tight : Christ's Hospital : from girlhood to Governor|date=2010|publisher=The Memoir Club|location=Durham|isbn=978-1-84104-499-6}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Allan|first1=G.

Founded in 1552 and received its first Royal Charter in 1553, Christ's Hospital follows much of the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] tradition. Since its establishment, Christ's Hospital has been a [[charity school]], with a core aim to offer children from humble backgrounds the chance of a better education.\n\n==Charitable foundation==\n[[File:quad DH.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Christ's Hospital quad towards dining hall. Picture taken from Big School]]\nChrist's Hospital is almost unique for a British independent school in that the majority of the students receive bursaries. This stems from its founding charter as a charitable school. School fees are paid on a [[Means test|means-tested]] basis, with substantial subsidies paid by the school or their benefactors, so that pupils from all walks of life are able to have private education that would otherwise be beyond the means of their parents.\n\n[[File:CH FntAvQuad.jpg|thumb|left|Westward photo of Quad and Front Avenue. (View from Art School)]]\n\nThe trustees of the foundation are the Council of Almoners, chaired by the Treasurer of Christ's Hospital, who govern the foundation according to a Scheme of Administration granted by the [[Charity Commission]]. The historic Court of Governors survives as a formal institution consisting of over 650 benefactors but its powers have since the 19th century been largely transferred to the smaller Council of Almoners.\n\nIn 2007 Christ's Hospital was formally separated into two related [[Charitable organization|registered charities]]: Christ's Hospital Foundation<ref>{{EW charity|306975|CHRIST'S HOSPITAL FOUNDATION}}</ref> and Christ's Hospital School.<ref>{{EW charity|1120090|CHRIST'S HOSPITAL SCHOOL}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Christ's Hospital, engraved by Toms c.1770..jpg|thumb|Christ's Hospital's buildings in London in 1770]]\n[[File:Edward VI of England c. 1546.jpg|left|thumb|[[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]]]\nChrist's Hospital was the result of the foundation by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and confirmed by [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], assisted by [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]], Bishop of London, and Sir Richard Dobbs, [[Lord Mayor of London]].<ref>Thornbury, Walter. \"Christ's Hospital.\" ''Old and New London'': Volume 2.

Retrieved 18 June 2019. \n</ref> Its genesis was the earlier [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of the monasteries]] and the resultant overflow onto the streets of the poor and destitute. Encouraged by a sermon from Ridley, exhorting mercy to the poor, the King wrote to the Lord Mayor encouraging him to action. This he did via a committee of 30 merchants. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had already granted the use of Greyfriars to the City for the relief of the poor and to house the homeless children which the magistrates had taken notice of.<ref>Nichols, John Gough. (1851). ''Chronicle of the Grey Friars of London''. London: Printed for the Camden Society by J.B. Nichols and Son, Printers. 'Preface' xxvi-xxvii. [https://archive.org/details/ChronicleOfTheGreyFriarsOfLondon/page/n1 The Internet Archive website] Retrieved 18 June 2019.</ref> Edward granted [[Bridewell Palace]], his lands at the [[Savoy Palace|Savoy]], and rents and other chattels to create three Royal Hospitals \u2014 Bridewell Hospital (now the [[King Edward's School, Witley]], [[Surrey]]), [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and Christ's Hospital, which was for the education of poor children.\n\nThe first boys and girls entered the school in [[Newgate]] in 1552. The [[Royal Charter]] was granted and signed by its founder, Edward VI, the following year. The first treasurer was [[Richard Grafton]]. The Protestant foundation survived the [[Mary I of England|Marian]] period and in the 1560s it sent its first scholars to Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe school occupied Newgate as its major site for 350 years, but from time to time children were housed in other parts of the country. 32 children perished during the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague of 1665]]. In the following year the [[Great Fire of London]] destroyed much of the Hospital, except four cloisters and three wards, but there were no casualties among the children. Around 200 pupils were sent to Islington and Clerkenwell and then to Ware and Hertford.\n\nBy the end of the 17th century the buildings had been rebuilt with the assistance of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]], a governor of Christ's Hospital, and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], who designed the Writing School (1696). The church of [[Christ Church Greyfriars|Christ Church, Newgate Street]], designed by Wren, replaced the damaged choir of the former Greyfriars' church and served as a place of worship for the children of Christ's Hospital in the City until the move to Horsham. Through the will of the royal jeweller, [[George Heriot]], it also became the inspiration for the foundation of [[George Heriot's School|George Heriot's Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]], which was the first of the \"Hospital Schools\" to be founded in Scotland.\n\nChrist's Hospital was given its second [[royal charter]] by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1673. This specifically created the [[Royal Mathematical School]], the original purpose of which was to train [[mathematics|mathematicians]] and [[navigation|navigators]] who would serve as naval officers and merchant seafarers. [[Samuel Pepys]], Secretary to His Majesty's Navy and from 1699 Vice-President of Christ's Hospital, made a considerable contribution to Christ's Hospital. [[Isaac Newton]], [[Jonas Moore]], [[John Flamsteed]], and  [[Edmund Halley]] contributed to plans for the course of study of the new school within the foundation.\n\n[[File:Blue Coat School Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|This early 19th-century picture shows the Great Hall on St. Matthew's Day, 21 September. On this day, two Grecians destined for scholarships to Oxford and Cambridge Universities gave orations in praise of the school, one in [[Latin]] and the other in English. The [[Antonio Verrio|Verrio]] painting can be seen along the wall on the right.]]\n\nThe girls of the hospital settled at [[Hertford]] from 1707. The governors had been paying a teacher in Hertford from 1653, and the removal of some children from London following the Great Fire strengthened the link with the town. In 1761, 200 boys under the age of ten along with the boys from Ware were relocated to Hertford. In 1778 the last girls were moved out of London to join the others at Hertford, where the school was rebuilt 1795\u20131798 to provide accommodation for the new numbers.\n\nChrist's Hospital's most famous upper master was [[James Boyer]] who presided from 1778 to 1799 and instructed [[James Leigh Hunt]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].\n\nIn November 1815 the \u201cmost infamous Regency [[flagellant]]\u201d, an MP named [[Eyre Coote (British Army officer)|Sir Eyre Coote,]] entered Christ's Hospital mathematical school, sent away the younger boys and paid the older ones for a session of mutual flogging. The school nurse arrived to find him buttoning his breeches; England's satirical press had come of age in time to make the very most of such a moment. Coote endured a cartoon<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1646990&partId=1|title=A peep into the blue coat school !!!!!!!!!!!-|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref> by [[George Cruikshank]], a vaunted caricaturist, and national humiliation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/05/25/sex-drugs-and-the-birth-of-modernity|title=Sex, drugs and the birth of modernity|date=2019-05-23|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-06-02|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\nTwo of 19th-century London's most notable architects, [[John Shaw Sr.|John Shaw Senior]] and [[John Shaw Jr|John Shaw Junior]], were architects and surveyors to Christ's Hospital throughout the first half of the 1800s. The Shaws' work included the old school hall (c.1825).\n\n[[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]] started a tradition of Royal Presidents in 1854.\n\nA commission of inquiry in 1837 proposed reforms, and in 1864 the Taunton Commission investigated the endowed schools. As a result of this a greater number of girls were admitted. However, in the 1890s boys still outnumbered girls at Hertford.\n\nAnother commission in 1877 proposed a new site for the school, where all the boys would be taught. This proposal  was questioned by some of the Governors. The Duke of Cambridge said \"I am one of those who are perfectly prepared to go with the spirit of the age in which we live, but I confess that I am also one of those who do not love change for change\u2019s sake. To upset an old and long standing institution... is a very dangerous experiment to try.\"\n\nHowever, the proposal was carried out. {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} of land outside Horsham in Sussex was purchased from the Aylesbury Dairy Company for \u00a347,500. The foundation stone was laid by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] on 23 October 1897, on behalf of the Sovereign, the date being the anniversary of the birthday of the founder. Architectural features from the old school buildings (the Grecians' Arch and the Wren Arch) were salvaged and incorporated in the new buildings.\n\nThe boys were relocated from Newgate and Hertford to the new site in 1902. Hertford became a girls-only school.\n\nOver the centuries Christ's Hospital has continued to enjoy royal patronage. In 1919, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] became the first Royal Patron, followed by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] in 1937 and HM [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] in 1953.\n\n==Traditions==\n[[File:Constant Lambert as a Blue coat boy.jpg|thumb|The composer [[Constant Lambert]] as a pupil, wearing the traditional uniform]]\nLinks with the City and the [[Lord Mayor of London]] are well maintained, with an annual parade through the City of London on [[Matthew the Evangelist|St. Matthew's Day]] and a regular place in the [[Lord Mayor's Show]].\n\nOne of the Christ's Hospital traditions is marching into lunch with the band, which is done each day except Sunday, weather permitting.\n\nAnother is the annual speech-day parade, where the Lord Mayor of London and his procession watch the school perform a march-past through the main quad. They also join the school in chapel for a grand service, and eat lunch with the Grecian year and their parents. Lastly they move to Big School to hear the Senior Grecian's oration and witness the Grecian prize-giving. This is held on the Saturday at the start of the Summer Half Term.\n\n===Uniform===\nThe school's  Tudor [[school uniform|uniform]] consists of belted, long blue coats, knee-breeches, yellow socks, and [[bands (neckwear)|bands]] at the neck. The uniform has been in place since 1553.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stow|first=John|editor=Thoms, William J.|title=A Survey of London, written in the year 1598 by John Stow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vA9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA119|edition=New edition, 1842 |year=1598|publisher=Whittaker|page=119}}</ref> The nickname \"Blue-coat School\" comes from the blue coats worn by the students; however, the nickname used within the school community itself is \"Housey\" and the long coat is called a \"Housey coat\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/visitor-information/Documents/29-records-of-christs-hospital-and-bluecoat-schools.pdf |format=PDF |title=London Metropolitan Archives : Information Leaflet Number 29 : Records of Christ's Hospital and Bluecoats Schools |website=Cityoflondon.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref>\n\nSecond and third form pupils wear a simple leather belt with a buckle.

This consists of a knee-length pleated skirt, summer jacket, yellow socks (for the boys and junior girls), and grey socks or grey/black tights for senior girls, as well as the long coat in winter, and the bands.\n\nIn 2011 students and alumni stated that they saw the uniform as an important way of giving the school a unique identity and unifying the school. Around that time the administrators had discussed the idea of updating the uniform. Over 95% of students voted in favour of keeping the original uniform.<ref name=\"Unifvote\">\"Students Vote to Keep Tudor Uniform.\" British Heritage 32, no. 2 (May 2011): 10.

Famous alumni of Christ's Hospital Music School include conductors Sir [[Colin Davis]], [[Charles Hazlewood]], [[Adrian Bawtree]], and Simon Joly, trumpeter [[David Mason (trumpet player)|David Mason]] (formerly Principal Trumpet of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra), composer [[Tim Benjamin]], and composer and conductor [[Constant Lambert]].\n\nThe school's chapel has a large five-manual [[Rushworth and Dreaper]] organ, one of four organs in the School (the others being a 3-manual 1829 Hill in Big School, played on by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and [[Karg-Elert]], a 2-manual [[Henry Willis & Sons|Father Willis]] in the Dining Hall, and a Flight and Robson chamber organ in the Court Room). The near 150-strong Chapel Choir has made many recordings and through these has earned an excellent reputation.\n\nThroughout the school's history, many musically gifted pupils have gone on to take up choral and organ scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge universities or have gained places at leading music conservatories. The school has a Symphony Orchestra and many other smaller choirs and instrumental ensembles, along with an annual House Singing Competition.

The school [[House system|houses]] are named after notable Old Blues (the CH-specific term for alumni), primarily writers. Each house has an \"A\" and \"B\" side, home to roughly 45 pupils. The houses are arranged from west to east as follows:\n\n===Avenue houses===\n\n*Peele \u2013 [[George Peele]] (boys)\n*Thornton \u2013 [[Edward Thornton (1766\u20131852)|Edward Thornton]]<ref>''Christ's Hospital'', G.A.T.

Leigh Hunt was originally the pair of preparatory houses, Prep A and Prep B, and were converted to junior houses on the abolition in 1964 of entry at the age of nine.\n\nThe sixteen original houses provided two dormitories (Upper Dorm and Lower Dorm) sleeping up to about 30 boys each. As the merger of the boys and girls approached, some dormitories were divided into cubicles, and subsequent developments created dormitories accommodating about twelve pupils each. Since 2001 there has been a rolling refurbishment programme, with the refurbished houses providing a range of accommodation: four-bed rooms for the junior pupils to one-bed rooms for the more senior pupils.\n\nUntil 1964, boys at Horsham lived in all-through houses from 2nd Form to Grecians (with the exception of Prep A and Prep B). Then houses were divided into senior houses (Peele, Thornton, Middleton, Coleridge and Lamb) and Junior houses (Barnes, Maine, Leigh Hunt) with boys transferring to a senior house after Little Erasmus. In conjunction with the merger, a further reorganisation occurred with each house converting to a senior side and a junior side. This system reverted to the all-through houses in 2000, now from 2nd Form to Deps.\n\n=== Grecians houses===\n\nYear 13 (Grecian) students move to Grecians houses, which provide a transitional style of life in preparation for university or life beyond school. The two Grecians houses were completed early in 2001 and have individual study bedrooms plus several general common rooms and kitchenettes shared by a group of seven to ten pupils.<ref>http://www.christs-hospital.org.uk/parents-handbook-dec09.pdf</ref> allowed them to prepare to live in mixed communal environment as they prepare themselves for university education.\n\n*Grecians West (for pupils who were previously in Peele, Thornton, Middleton, and Coleridge)\n*Grecians East (for pupils who were previously in Lamb, Barnes, Maine, and Leigh Hunt)\n\n==Controversies ==\n===Sexual abuse ===\nSexual abuse of pupils from 1969 to 2001<ref name=\"bbc20180713\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-44817719|title=Christ's Hospital School teacher jailed for pupil rape|author=|date=13 July 2018|website=BBC News}}</ref> led to six former teachers being convicted of offences after more than 20 former students made complaints to the police in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-44654838|title=Teacher guilty of raping pupil|date=5 July 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/16353070.teacher-james-husband-from-york-jailed-for-17-years-for-raping-pupil|title=Teacher James Husband, from York, jailed for 17 years for raping pupil|date=13 July 2018|work=York Press|access-date=2018-07-13}}</ref> The convicted former teachers were sentenced to prison terms of up to 17 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-44817719|title=Christ's Hospital School teacher jailed for pupil rape|date=13 July 2018|website=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Alumni==\n{{See|List of people educated at Christ's Hospital}}\nPeople educated at Christ's Hospital are called Old Blues.\n\n==Staff==\nNotable members of staff have included:\n*[[Edward Baldwin, 4th Earl Baldwin of Bewdley]]\n*[[Adrian Bawtree]]\n*[[Edward Buck (rower)|Edward Buck]]\n*[[Samuel Cobb (poet)|Samuel Cobb]]\n*[[Gerald Davies]]\n*[[Ralph Henry Carless Davis]]\n*[[John Flamsteed]] ([[Astronomer Royal]])\n*[[William Hamilton Fyfe]]\n*[[Steve Gatting]]\n*[[Bruce Grindlay]]\n*[[George Andrew Jacob]]\n*[[Craig Sellar Lang]]\n*[[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harrison |first1=Derek |title=Derrick Somerset Macnutt |url=http://www.crossword.org.uk/ximenes.htm |website=www.crossword.org.uk |accessdate=18 December 2018}}</ref>\n*[[William Wales (astronomer)]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|West Sussex|London|Schools}}\n*[[Christ's Hospital Band]]\n*[[Christ's Hospital railway station]]\n*[[Erasmus Smith]]\n*[[List of Victoria Crosses by school]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last1=Davies-Jenkins|first1=Sue|title=Hang on tight : Christ's Hospital : from girlhood to Governor|date=2010|publisher=The Memoir Club|location=Durham|isbn=978-1-84104-499-6}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Allan|first1=G.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days.

This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

Indeed, cultural, ethnic, and religious differences between Anglos and Hispanics persisted in the decades after the Mexican War.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 36}}</ref> Although the episodes of ethnic violence were episodic,<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 133}}</ref> the historian Alonzo argues that \"Anglo superiority also served to rationalize the very common idea in Texas that it is no wrong to kill a Mexican and, worse still, that killing an ethnic Mexican was an act to be proud of.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 134}}</ref>\n\nIn his book about Gregorio Cortez's life, Am\u00e9rico Paredes highlights the role of the Texas Rangers division in exacerbating the cultural conflicts on the border due to their alleged violent methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|pages= 23-32}}</ref>. An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Sometime in this period, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting lang from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. At the Robledo residence, a couple of days past, authorities had found Cortez and thus begun the Battle of Belmont (see above).  \n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his mare jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. Suspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio.\n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The fund, largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]], saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\" (ranchers).<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, many [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe battle of the courts began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> waiting with anticipation to see Cortez sentenced to death. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. Though they originally claimed the murder to have been done by a Mrs. Robledo during the fight, Robledo was coaxed into testifying that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Sheriff of Gonzales County, Robert M. Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home, Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure, ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense his story and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a rushed decision emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nThe criminalization of Cortez continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris, as they understood he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, as the Columbus trial sentenced Cortez for Glover's murder assuming he had already killed Morris, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref> The defense's claim was denied by many witnesses, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v.

Glover, who was killed during the pursuit. Efforts to have Cortez pardoned began with his incarceration and finally succeeded in 1913 when Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] issued him a conditional [[pardon]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> At long last, in July 1913, Governor Colquitt granted Gregorio an official pardon, and he was freed on July 14 of that year.\n\n== Post-prison life and death ==\n\nAfter his pardon in 1913, Cortez thanked those who helped secure his freedom, spent his later years in [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico]], and joined the losing [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertist]] forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> After being wounded in the war, Cortez began living with one of his sons in [[Manor, Texas]] then later resided in [[Anson, Texas]].<ref>Brown, 150</ref><ref name= Deutsch2012>[https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19510/cfch_Deutsch_GregorioCortez.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Deutsch, James I. 2012. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" in Great Lives from History: Latinos.]</ref>.

In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 175}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks.

''Am\u00e9rico Paredes.'']</ref>. The particularity of the work is that it constitutes a hybrid of genres. The first chapter and the third chapters are historical. In the first one, he retraces the social and political background of the former Spanish province of [[Nuevo Santander]] to explain the origin of ethnic tensions. In the third chapter, through extensive corpus sources (judicial reports, newspapers, and testimonies) he reconstructs in detail the whole life of Cortez.

It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n* [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]\n* [[manifest destiny]]\n* [[Mexican-American]]\n* [[Texas Ranger Division]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

Duke University Press, Durham, NC, 2013;2012;.</ref> The vast majority of [[Mexican-Americans]] also suffered racial discrimination. Indeed, cultural, ethnic, and religious differences between Anglos and Hispanics persisted in the decades after the Mexican War.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 36}}</ref> Although the episodes of ethnic violence were episodic,<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 133}}</ref> the historian Alonzo argues that \"Anglo superiority also served to rationalize the very common idea in Texas that it is no wrong to kill a Mexican and, worse still, that killing an ethnic Mexican was an act to be proud of.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 134}}</ref>\n\nIn his book about Gregorio Cortez's life, Am\u00e9rico Paredes highlights the role of the Texas Rangers division in exacerbating the cultural conflicts on the border due to their alleged violent methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|pages= 23-32}}</ref>. An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Sometime in this period, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting lang from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. At the Robledo residence, a couple of days past, authorities had found Cortez and thus begun the Battle of Belmont (see above).  \n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his mare jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. Suspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio.\n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The fund, largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]], saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\" (ranchers).<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, many [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe battle of the courts began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> waiting with anticipation to see Cortez sentenced to death. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. Though they originally claimed the murder to have been done by a Mrs. Robledo during the fight, Robledo was coaxed into testifying that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Sheriff of Gonzales County, Robert M. Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home, Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure, ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense his story and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a rushed decision emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nThe criminalization of Cortez continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris, as they understood he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, as the Columbus trial sentenced Cortez for Glover's murder assuming he had already killed Morris, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref> The defense's claim was denied by many witnesses, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v. State, 83 S.W. 812 (Tex. Crim. App. 1904)] </ref>\n\nThe legal plight of Gregorio Cortez lasted upwards of three years and though he was sentenced to life behind bars, the outcry for his justice and eventual [[pardon]] began as soon as the court proceedings had concluded.\n\n=== Prison and pardon ===\nCortez was sentenced not for the death of Morris (which sparked the entire escapade), but for his alleged murder of Sheriff Robert M. Glover, who was killed during the pursuit. Efforts to have Cortez pardoned began with his incarceration and finally succeeded in 1913 when Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] issued him a conditional [[pardon]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> At long last, in July 1913, Governor Colquitt granted Gregorio an official pardon, and he was freed on July 14 of that year.\n\n== Post-prison life and death ==\n\nAfter his pardon in 1913, Cortez thanked those who helped secure his freedom, spent his later years in [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico]], and joined the losing [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertist]] forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> After being wounded in the war, Cortez began living with one of his sons in [[Manor, Texas]] then later resided in [[Anson, Texas]].<ref>Brown, 150</ref><ref name= Deutsch2012>[https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19510/cfch_Deutsch_GregorioCortez.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Deutsch, James I. 2012. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" in Great Lives from History: Latinos.]</ref>. Then on February 28, 1916, having been recently married for the third time to an assumed Esther Mart\u00ednez, Cortez died suddenly at the age of 40.<ref name=\"orozco\" /><ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />\n\nTo this day, the [[cause of death]] of Cortez is contested. There are assumptions of [[natural causes]], [[heart attack]], [[pneumonia]],<ref>Brown, 150</ref> or possible [[poisoning]] done unto him by \"enemies who did not want to see him free.\"<ref name= Deutsch2012 /> He was buried eight miles outside of [[Anson, Texas|Anson]], and as Paredes notes his grave lies approximately \"five hundred miles from the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Border]] on which he was born.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 104}}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n=== El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez ===\n\nAs Cortez's story spread to [[Mexican-American]] settlements across the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]], it was transformed into a [[ballad]] where he was often revered as a hero of the border Mexican community and whose resilience against persecutory law enforcement inspired many. In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 175}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks. The Legacy of Am\u00e9rico Paredes. vol. no. 10, Texas A & M University Press, College Station, 2006. p71 </ref> <ref> [https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/benson/paredes/biography.html Meier, Matt. ''Am\u00e9rico Paredes.'']</ref>. The particularity of the work is that it constitutes a hybrid of genres. The first chapter and the third chapters are historical. In the first one, he retraces the social and political background of the former Spanish province of [[Nuevo Santander]] to explain the origin of ethnic tensions. In the third chapter, through extensive corpus sources (judicial reports, newspapers, and testimonies) he reconstructs in detail the whole life of Cortez. The second chapter could be classified as a study of regional folklore because he describes \"an idealized and formalized version of the legend.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 108}}</ref> In the second part of the book \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez, a Ballad of Border Conflict,\u201d Paredes provides a study of the narrative form of the corrido. This part integrates elements of sociolinguistics, through an analysis of the choice of words and the mixing of English and Spanish, anthropology, through an ethnographic description of the border culture, ethnomusicology with a study of the different variants of Gregorio Cortez's Ballad and their meanings <ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks. The Legacy of Am\u00e9rico Paredes. vol. no. 10, Texas A & M University Press, College Station, 2006.pp 71-82</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== In Film ===\n\nThe legend was turned into the film ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]], in 1983. It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n* [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]\n* [[manifest destiny]]\n* [[Mexican-American]]\n* [[Texas Ranger Division]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.
