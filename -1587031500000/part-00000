[[Sumner Redstone]], whose Viacom conglomerate then owned Blockbuster, personally pioneered a new revenue-sharing arrangement for video in the mid-1980s. Blockbuster obtained videos for little cost and kept 60% of the rental fee, paying the other 40% to the studio, and reporting rental information through the global media measurement and research company [[Rentrak]]. In addition to benefiting from a lower initial price, Blockbuster also capitalized on the fact that movies were generally not available for purchase at affordable price points during initial release periods. Thus customers had a choice to rent, wait, or buy the film on tape at the much higher [[Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price|manufacturer's suggested retail price]] targeted at other rental chains and film enthusiasts, which at that time ranged between $70\u2013$100 per title.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Quantity and selection of titles===\nBlockbuster stores followed a strategy of emphasizing access to the most popular new releases, obtaining early access and stocking many copies of the new-release titles, with a relatively smaller depth of selection than traditional independent video stores.<ref name=Adams>{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Nathan |date=February 22, 2011 |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/anyone-want-to-buy-blockbuster-d8b5d4d0e8b7/ |title=Anyone Want to Buy Blockbuster? |access-date=April 1, 2018}}</ref> Much of the shelf space in the stores was devoted to popular titles that were placed relatively sparsely on the shelves with the entire front cover visible, so customers could browse casually and quickly, rather than having a more diverse selection with fewer copies of each title. Blockbuster sometimes contracted with studios to obtain earlier access to new titles than other companies could achieve. Examples of such contracts were those in which Blockbuster became the exclusive rental chain for new releases from the World Wrestling Federation (now known as [[WWE]]),  [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]], [[Universal Studios]], [[The Weinstein Company]], [[Miramax]], [[Lionsgate]], [[Disney]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[MGM]], [[Sony]], [[Image Entertainment]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[New Line Cinema]] and Allumination FilmWorks.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2006-11-15-blockbuster-weinsteins_x.htm | work=[[USA Today]] |agency=[[Reuters]] | title=Blockbuster signs deal to be exclusive renter for Weinsteins | date=November 15, 2006 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.times-news.com/news/local_news/agreement-gives-blockbuster-exclusive-access-to-new-release-warner-bros/article_b70de4b8-a4c7-5355-93be-e6c4ee46b57e.html|title=Agreement gives Blockbuster exclusive access to new release Warner Bros. films|first=Cory GalliherCumberland|last=Times-News|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}</ref> As one commentator complained, \"Blockbuster was once an unstoppable giant whose franchises swept across the country putting mom and pop video stores out of business left and right by offering a larger selection of new releases, pricing them at a lower point due to the volume they worked in...

In 1992, the [[Virgin Group]] and Blockbuster Inc entered into a joint venture to set up Australia's first [[Virgin Megastores]] in [[Sydney]], Melbourne, and [[Adelaide]]. This lasted until Virgin sold its interest in the six stores to Blockbuster, which promptly rebranded them in 1993 as Blockbuster Music. In 1994, Australian store numbers rose to 54 with the acquisition of Major Video and Focus chains in both [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]]. In 1995, the growth continued with the opening of the 100th video store in the country. By the end of 1998, Blockbuster Australia opened over 125 stores. In July 1998, Blockbuster Australia launched into [[franchising]] with the conversion of the former Video Flicks franchise group in [[Queensland]], and the former Movieland group in [[Western Australia]] six months later. Also in 1998, the company sold its last two Australian Blockbuster Music stores in [[Pitt Street]], Sydney, and [[Chapel Street, Melbourne]] to Brazin Limited, which incorporated them under its [[Sanity Entertainment]] brand. Throughout 1999 and 2000, Blockbuster Australia quickly expanded its franchise store network through the conversion of smaller groups and the granting of individual franchises. Before 2005, this was done through the acquisition of the Movies Plus Group and the conversion of some individual Movies 4U and Movieland outlets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlysydney.com.au/shopping-services/music-video-dvd/rental-outlets/blockbuster |title=Blockbuster Australia: New South Wales stores |publisher=Only Sydney |accessdate=March 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327131536/http://www.onlysydney.com.au/shopping-services/music-video-dvd/rental-outlets/blockbuster |archivedate=March 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/116624/brazin_acquires_brashs/ |title=Brazin acquires Brashs |first=Ellen |last=Cresswell |work=[[International Data Group|ARN]] |date=April 22, 1998 |accessdate=March 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/blockbuster-inc-history/ |title=Blockbuster Inc.

[[Video Ezy]] had 518 Australian outlets, all of them being owned by franchisees, pushing the combined group's [[market share]] to 40% of the country's video rental sector. Video Ezy committed to the [[master franchise]] agreement with Blockbuster for 10 years operating the brand with the possibility of renewal for a further 10 years after that.

The program sparked investigations and charges of misrepresentation in 48 states and the District of Columbia: state attorneys general including [[Bill Lockyer]] of California, [[Greg Abbott]] of Texas, and [[Eliot Spitzer]] of New York argued that customers were being automatically charged the full purchase price of late rentals and a restocking fee for rentals returned after 30 days. In a settlement, Blockbuster agreed to reimburse the states the cost of their investigation, clarify communication to customers on the terms of the program, and offer reimbursement to customers charged fees prior to the clarification. New Jersey filed a separate lawsuit and was not a party to the settlement.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/18/entertainment/main675086.shtml |publisher=CBS News |date=February 18, 2005 |title=Blockbuster Sued Over Late Fees}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7327309 |publisher=NBC News |date=March 30, 2005 |title=Blockbuster settles \"no late fees\" claims}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36767-2005Feb18.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Blockbuster sued over return policy |date=February 19, 2005 |author=Caroline Mayer}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2005-02-27-track_x.htm |author=Michael McCarthy |date=February 27, 2005 |work=[[USA Today]] |title='No late fees' ads cause a stir}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/30/business/fi-blockbuster30 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 30, 2005 |author=Lorenza Munoz |title=Blockbuster Settles State Probes Into Late Fee Ads}}</ref>\n\nThe 2005 controversy came after a related lawsuit settled in 2002 in Texas. That lawsuit, alleging exorbitant late fees, led the company to pay $9.25 million in attorney fees and offer $450 million in late fee refund coupons (which were rent-one get-one-free coupons, and thus required the customer to make an initial expenditure). The company estimated that the coupons would ultimately cost about $45 million depending on the redemption rate; an attorney for the plaintiffs estimated the final cost at closer to $100 million at a redemption rate of about 20% (calculated based on a similar case in Michigan).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.courant.com/topic/sns-blockbuster,0,5496993.story |date=June 6, 2001|author=Sarah Hale|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|via=[[Hartford Courant]]|title=Blockbuster to settle lawsuit over late fees}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,42827,00.html |publisher=Fox News |date=January 11, 2002 |title=Blockbuster customers to be reimbursed for late fees |access-date=January 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518232511/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,42827,00.html |archive-date=May 18, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nSuch corrections were also sent to international stores such as those in Canada to prevent further lawsuits.\n\nBlockbuster reintroduced late fees in the United States in 2010 under the name of \"Additional Daily Rates\".

[[Sumner Redstone]], whose Viacom conglomerate then owned Blockbuster, personally pioneered a new revenue-sharing arrangement for video in the mid-1980s. Blockbuster obtained videos for little cost and kept 60% of the rental fee, paying the other 40% to the studio, and reporting rental information through the global media measurement and research company [[Rentrak]]. In addition to benefiting from a lower initial price, Blockbuster also capitalized on the fact that movies were generally not available for purchase at affordable price points during initial release periods. Thus customers had a choice to rent, wait, or buy the film on tape at the much higher [[Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price|manufacturer's suggested retail price]] targeted at other rental chains and film enthusiasts, which at that time ranged between $70\u2013$100 per title.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Quantity and selection of titles===\nBlockbuster stores followed a strategy of emphasizing access to the most popular new releases, obtaining early access and stocking many copies of the new-release titles, with a relatively smaller depth of selection than traditional independent video stores.<ref name=Adams>{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Nathan |date=February 22, 2011 |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/anyone-want-to-buy-blockbuster-d8b5d4d0e8b7/ |title=Anyone Want to Buy Blockbuster? |access-date=April 1, 2018}}</ref> Much of the shelf space in the stores was devoted to popular titles that were placed relatively sparsely on the shelves with the entire front cover visible, so customers could browse casually and quickly, rather than having a more diverse selection with fewer copies of each title. Blockbuster sometimes contracted with studios to obtain earlier access to new titles than other companies could achieve. Examples of such contracts were those in which Blockbuster became the exclusive rental chain for new releases from the World Wrestling Federation (now known as [[WWE]]),  [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]], [[Universal Studios]], [[The Weinstein Company]], [[Miramax]], [[Lionsgate]], [[Disney]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[MGM]], [[Sony]], [[Image Entertainment]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[New Line Cinema]] and Allumination FilmWorks.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2006-11-15-blockbuster-weinsteins_x.htm | work=[[USA Today]] |agency=[[Reuters]] | title=Blockbuster signs deal to be exclusive renter for Weinsteins | date=November 15, 2006 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.times-news.com/news/local_news/agreement-gives-blockbuster-exclusive-access-to-new-release-warner-bros/article_b70de4b8-a4c7-5355-93be-e6c4ee46b57e.html|title=Agreement gives Blockbuster exclusive access to new release Warner Bros. films|first=Cory GalliherCumberland|last=Times-News|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}</ref> As one commentator complained, \"Blockbuster was once an unstoppable giant whose franchises swept across the country putting mom and pop video stores out of business left and right by offering a larger selection of new releases, pricing them at a lower point due to the volume they worked in...

In 1992, the [[Virgin Group]] and Blockbuster Inc entered into a joint venture to set up Australia's first [[Virgin Megastores]] in [[Sydney]], Melbourne, and [[Adelaide]]. This lasted until Virgin sold its interest in the six stores to Blockbuster, which promptly rebranded them in 1993 as Blockbuster Music. In 1994, Australian store numbers rose to 54 with the acquisition of Major Video and Focus chains in both [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]]. In 1995, the growth continued with the opening of the 100th video store in the country. By the end of 1998, Blockbuster Australia opened over 125 stores. In July 1998, Blockbuster Australia launched into [[franchising]] with the conversion of the former Video Flicks franchise group in [[Queensland]], and the former Movieland group in [[Western Australia]] six months later. Also in 1998, the company sold its last two Australian Blockbuster Music stores in [[Pitt Street]], Sydney, and [[Chapel Street, Melbourne]] to Brazin Limited, which incorporated them under its [[Sanity Entertainment]] brand. Throughout 1999 and 2000, Blockbuster Australia quickly expanded its franchise store network through the conversion of smaller groups and the granting of individual franchises. Before 2005, this was done through the acquisition of the Movies Plus Group and the conversion of some individual Movies 4U and Movieland outlets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlysydney.com.au/shopping-services/music-video-dvd/rental-outlets/blockbuster |title=Blockbuster Australia: New South Wales stores |publisher=Only Sydney |accessdate=March 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327131536/http://www.onlysydney.com.au/shopping-services/music-video-dvd/rental-outlets/blockbuster |archivedate=March 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/116624/brazin_acquires_brashs/ |title=Brazin acquires Brashs |first=Ellen |last=Cresswell |work=[[International Data Group|ARN]] |date=April 22, 1998 |accessdate=March 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/blockbuster-inc-history/ |title=Blockbuster Inc.

[[Video Ezy]] had 518 Australian outlets, all of them being owned by franchisees, pushing the combined group's [[market share]] to 40% of the country's video rental sector. Video Ezy committed to the [[master franchise]] agreement with Blockbuster for 10 years operating the brand with the possibility of renewal for a further 10 years after that.

That lawsuit, alleging exorbitant late fees, led the company to pay $9.25 million in attorney fees and offer $450 million in late fee refund coupons (which were rent-one get-one-free coupons, and thus required the customer to make an initial expenditure). The company estimated that the coupons would ultimately cost about $45 million depending on the redemption rate; an attorney for the plaintiffs estimated the final cost at closer to $100 million at a redemption rate of about 20% (calculated based on a similar case in Michigan).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.courant.com/topic/sns-blockbuster,0,5496993.story |date=June 6, 2001|author=Sarah Hale|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|via=[[Hartford Courant]]|title=Blockbuster to settle lawsuit over late fees}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,42827,00.html |publisher=Fox News |date=January 11, 2002 |title=Blockbuster customers to be reimbursed for late fees |access-date=January 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518232511/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,42827,00.html |archive-date=May 18, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nSuch corrections were also sent to international stores such as those in Canada to prevent further lawsuits.\n\nBlockbuster reintroduced late fees in the United States in 2010 under the name of \"Additional Daily Rates\".

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

Ottawa played A. Cope instead and lost 9\u20135. The fans in attendance heckled the defence pair of [[Harvey Pulford]] and [[Weldy Young]], and in response Mr. Young went into the crowd to attack a spectator.\n\n===Final Standing===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The objective of this development program was to further modernize the [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean army]], despite the superior capability of existing [[K1 88-Tank|K1 and K1A1]] designs versus North Korean tanks, most of which are aging [[T-55]]s and [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]]s. Emphasis upon indigenous technologies would also allow the proposed vehicle to enter the export market without licensing difficulties.\n\nEarly design variants included a version with an unmanned turret, which was later scrapped in favor of manned turret designs. It was also planned for the vehicle to be equipped with [[Rheinmetall]]'s experimental 140&nbsp;mm smoothbore gun, though the K2 was subsequently reconfigured for the [[Rheinmetall 120&nbsp;mm gun|120&nbsp;mm/L55]] when Rheinmetall ceased development of the new weapon, determining that the 120&nbsp;mm/L55 would be more than capable of defeating prospective armored threats into the foreseeable future. The 120&nbsp;mm/L55 is equipped with a 6.6 m-length barrel that is {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} longer than the 120 mm main gun in the K1A1. This results in a higher muzzle velocity of {{convert|1,400|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} for greater accuracy and armor penetration (compared to {{convert|1,140|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} for the K1A1). The K2's autoloader also allows it to reload its main gun more quickly compared to its predecessor.\n\nThe K2 is capable of [[deep wading|fording]] {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}-deep rivers, is equipped with a posture control function that can tilt the chassis or lower its overall height by {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} and deploys a laser warning system that can turn the turret towards the source of hostile fire almost instantaneously.<ref>[http://www.mnd.go.kr/user/boardList.action?command=view&page=1&boardId=O_47261&boardSeq=O_104438&titleId=null&id=mnd_eng_030100000000 True worth of masterwork, \"great power\" during performance demonstration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016214630/http://www.mnd.go.kr/user/boardList.action?command=view&page=1&boardId=O_47261&boardSeq=O_104438&titleId=null&id=mnd_eng_030100000000 |date=2014-10-16 }} - MND.go.kr, 8 October 2014</ref>\n\n===Engines and powertrains===\n\nIn March 2011, South Korea's [[Defense Acquisition Program Administration]] (DAPA) announced that mass production of the K2, which the Army was expecting to deploy in 2012, would not happen due to problems concerning its engine and transmission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/03/116_83997.html|title=Made-in-Korea arms struggle with defects|publisher=The Korea Times|date=28 March 2011|author=Lee Tae-hoon|access-date=29 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002074000/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/03/116_83997.html|archive-date=2 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In April 2012, DAPA announced that due to ongoing issues with the reliability and durability of the domestically-produced powerpack, the first 100 production K2s would use German-made MTU powerpack and that service entry would be delayed until March 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/04/116_108229.html|title=Korea to buy German engines for K2 tanks|publisher=The Korea Times|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=3 April 2012|author=Lee Tae-hoon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403122431/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/04/116_108229.html|archive-date=3 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe first 15 K2 Black Panther tanks were put into service in June 2014.

This is complemented by an autoloader, similar to that designed for the [[Leclerc tank|Leclerc]] tank; it can fire up to 10 rounds a minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.daum.net/politics/dipdefen/newsview?newsid=20150206030531423|title=\ud30c\uc6cc\ud329 \ub17c\ub780 K2\uc804\ucc28 \"\uc804\ub825\ud654 \uc774\uc0c1\ubb34\".. 1.2km \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4 1.2m \ud45c\uc801\uc9c0\uc5d0 '\ucf85\ucf85'|work=daum.net|accessdate=7 September 2016|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150210082559/http://media.daum.net/politics/dipdefen/newsview?newsid=20150206030531423|archive-date=10 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The ammunition for the main gun is loaded in a 16-shell magazine. The tank has a total ammunition capacity of 40 rounds for its main armament.\n\nSecondary weapons include a 12.7&nbsp;mm [[M2 Browning|K6 Machine Gun]] heavy machine gun and a 7.62&nbsp;mm coaxial machine gun.\n\n=== Fire-control system and optics ===\nThe K2 is equipped with an advanced [[fire-control system]] linked to an [[Extremely High Frequency]] [[radar]] system deployed on the frontal arc of the turret, along with a traditional [[laser rangefinder]] and crosswind sensor. The system is capable of a \"lock-on\" mode, which can acquire and track specific targets up to a range of {{convert|9.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} using a [[thermographic camera]]. This allows the crew to fire accurately while moving as well as engage low-flying aircraft.\n\nThe fire-control system is also linked to an advanced gun stabilizer and trigger-delay mechanism to optimise accuracy while moving in uneven terrain. If the trigger on the main gun is pulled at the same time the tank encounters an irregularity in the terrain, oscillation of the gun barrel will cause temporary misalignment between a laser emitter at the top of the barrel and a sensor at the base. This will delay the fire-control system from activating until the beam is re-aligned, improving the chances of hitting the intended target.\n\nThe Korean Gunner's Primary Sight (KGPS) and the [[Korean Commander's Panoramic Sight]] (KCPS) are present in the Black Panther as in the original series of K1A1 tanks, though modified to utilise the more advanced sensors and armaments deployed on the K2.\n\nThe commander of the tank has the ability to override the command to take control of the turret and gun from the gunner. Moreover, unconfirmed reports state that, in the event of an emergency, the vehicle can be operated by only two crew members, or even a single one. It is speculated that the fire-control system can automatically spot and track visible targets, compare them using the data link established with other friendly vehicles to prevent redundant target engagements, and fire its main gun without manual input.\n[[File:2014 \ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d \ubc29\uc704\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc804(DX Korea) \uc721\uad70\uc758 \uba85\ud488 \ubb34\uae30\uc640 \uc7a5\ube44 \uc18c\uac1c (15393852929).jpg|thumb|250px|K-2 tank on display along with its APFSDS munition rounds and K6 heavy machine gun rounds.]]\n\n=== Munitions ===\nThe K2's primary anti-tank munition is an indigenously developed improved [[tungsten]] [[APFSDS]] [[kinetic energy penetrator]]. For attacking unhardened targets, the K2 can use a multi-purpose [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|HEAT]] chemical energy round, similar to the U.S. [[M830]]A1 HEAT MP-T, providing good offensive capabilities against personnel, unarmored and lightly armored vehicles on the ground as well as low-flying helicopters.\n\nThe Korean Smart Top-Attack Munition ([[KSTAM]]) is a [[fire-and-forget]], top-attack anti-tank munition with an effective operating range of {{convert|2\u20138|km|mi|abbr=on}}, developed specifically for use with the K2. It is launched as a kinetic energy projectile, fired from the main gun in a high trajectory profile comparable to that of a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]. Upon reaching its designated target area, a parachute deploys, giving on-board [[millimeter band]] [[radar]], [[infrared]] and [[radiometer]] sensors time to seek and acquire stationary or moving targets. When a target is acquired, an [[explosively formed penetrator]] is fired from a top-down position, to exploit the weaker top armor of tanks. Target acquisition can also be directed manually by the tank crew via a remote link. These characteristics allow the launch vehicle to remain concealed behind cover while firing successive rounds towards the known location of an enemy, or provide effective indirect fire support against targets hidden behind obstacles and structures.\n\n== Defensive capabilities ==\n[[File:20\uc0ac\ub2e8 \ub0a8\ud55c\uac15 \ud639\ud55c\uae30 \ud6c8\ub828- (1) (24487615636).jpg|thumb|250px|K-2 tanks deploy smoke grenades during a manoeuvre drill.]]\nDetails of the composite armor of the Black Panther are classified. The frontal armor has been claimed to be effective against the 120&nbsp;mm APFSDS round fired from the [[L55]] gun.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Explosive Reactive Armor]] blocks are also present, with the addition of [[Reactive armour|Non-Explosive Reactive Armor]] planned for the K2 PIP (Product Improvement Program) version.\n\nDefense against incoming missiles is provided by a soft-kill anti-missile system.\n\nThe millimeter band radar system mounted on the turret is capable of operating as a [[Missile Approach Warning]] System (MAWS). The vehicle's computer in turn can triangulate incoming projectiles, immediately warn the vehicle crew and fire off [[Smoke screen|Visual and Infrared Screening Smoke]] (VIRSS) grenades, which can effectively block optical, infrared and radar signatures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Once the hard-kill AMS is installed, the radar system will also be responsible for tracking and targeting the incoming missiles for the AMS.\n\nThe K2 also has a [[Radar Warning Receiver]] (RWR) and [[radar jammer]]. Four all-bearing [[Laser warning receiver]]s (LWR) are also present to alert the crew should the vehicle become \"painted\", and the computer can also deploy VIRSS grenades towards the direction of the beam.\n\nAn [[automatic fire suppression]] system is programmed to detect and put out any internal fires that may occur, and atmospheric sensors alert the crew if the tank enters a hazardous environment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Mobility and maneuverability ==\n[[File:2014_%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD_%EB%B0%A9%EC%9C%84%EC%82%B0%EC%97%85%EC%A0%84%28DX_Korea%29_%EC%9C%A1%EA%B5%B0%EC%9D%98_%EB%AA%85%ED%92%88_%EB%AC%B4%EA%B8%B0%EC%99%80_%EC%9E%A5%EB%B9%84_%EC%86%8C%EA%B0%9C_%2815556786856%29.jpg|thumb|250px|K2 tank about to cross a water pool submerged with snorkel]]\nThe K2 can travel at speeds of up to 70&nbsp;km/h on road surfaces, accelerate from 0 to 32&nbsp;km/h within 8.7 seconds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hankookilbo.com/v/7be857028eda4f758e3e4b89d20f1897|title=\"\ud0f1\ud06c \uac00\uc18d\uc131\ub2a5 \uae30\uc900 \uc644\ud654\" \u8ecd, K2 \uad6d\uc0b0\ud654 \uc644\ub8cc \uac00\ub2e5|work=hankookilbo.com|accessdate=7 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306094221/http://hankookilbo.com/v/7be857028eda4f758e3e4b89d20f1897|archive-date=6 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunyerang.com/archives/857|title=sunyerang.com|work=sunyerang.com|accessdate=7 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006091057/http://www.sunyerang.com/archives/857|archivedate=6 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bemil.chosun.com/nbrd/bbs/view.html?b_bbs_id=10040&pn=1&num=81034|title=\ud751\ud45c\uc5d4\uc9c4 \uac00\uc18d\uc131\ub2a5 2011\ub144\uc5d0\ub3c4 8.77\ucd08 \ub098\uc628\uac70 \uac19\uc740\ub370\uc694.|last=BEMIL|access-date=2014-10-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007145939/http://bemil.chosun.com/nbrd/bbs/view.html?b_bbs_id=10040&pn=1&num=81034|archive-date=2014-10-07|url-status=live}}</ref> and maintain speeds of up to 52&nbsp;km/h in off-road conditions. It can also climb 60-degree slopes and vertical obstacles 1.8 meters in height. Due to the relatively compact design of the engine, the designers were able to fit an additional Samsung Techwin gas-turbine engine into the remaining compartment space. This is capable of producing {{convert|100|hp}}, and intended to act as an auxiliary power unit with which the tank may power its on-board systems when its main engines are turned off. It will also allow the tank to conserve fuel when idling and minimise the vehicle's thermal and acoustic signatures.\n\nThe vehicle can cross rivers as deep as 4.1 meters using a snorkel system, which also serves as a conning tower for the tank commander. The system takes approximately 20~30 minutes to prepare. The turret becomes watertight while fording, but the chassis can take in 500 gallons of water to prevent excessive buoyancy from air inside the vehicle and keep the tracks planted firmly on the ground. Furthermore, the tank can enter combat-ready status as soon as it resurfaces. It is said that K2's predecessor, K1, can cross a river of 2 meter depth after 2 hours of preparation, which also requires assistance from military engineers. However, a K2 tank does not require outside assistance for river crossing.\n\nThe Black Panther fields an advanced suspension system, called the In-arm Suspension Unit (ISU), which allows for individual control of every bogie on the tracks. This allows the K2 to \"sit\", \"stand\" and \"kneel\", as well as \"lean\" towards one side or a corner. \"Sitting\" gives the tank a lower profile and offers superior handling over roads. \"Standing\" gives the vehicle higher ground clearance for maneuverability over rough terrain. \"Kneeling\" augments the angular range in which the tank's gun barrel can elevate and depress, allowing the vehicle to fire its main gun downhill as well as engage low-flying aircraft more effectively. The suspension unit also cushions the chassis from vibrations when travelling over uneven terrain, as the bogies can be adjusted individually on-the-fly.\n\nUsing the suspension system, K2 is able to elevate its main gun up to 24 degrees, which allows a curved trajectory attack at a hovering helicopter target {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20141003500213|title=[\uc2e0\uc778\uade0\uc758 \ubc00\ub9ac\ud130\ub9ac \ub974\ud3ec] K-2\ud751\ud45c\uc804\ucc28\uc640 \uae30\ub3d9\uad70\ub2e8|work=seoul.co.kr|accessdate=7 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629140055/http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20141003500213|archive-date=29 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe K2 also has advanced track system called Dynamic Track Tensioning System. DTTS allows computer to keep the track's tension optimally by constantly changing its suspension automatically, making it hard to breakaway even in extreme maneuver.\n\n== Network-centric considerations ==\nThe K2 houses the following features which help to improve situational awareness for the crew:\n\n*[[C4I]] (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) uplink.\n*[[GPS]] (Global Positioning Satellite) uplink.\n*[[Identification Friend or Foe|IFF/SIF]] (Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature) system compliant with [[STANAG]] 4579. Located on the main gun mantlet, just above the gun, the system fires a 38&nbsp;GHz beam in the direction of the gun for a response from the targeted vehicle. If a proper response signal is shown by the target, the fire control system automatically identifies it as a friendly. If the target fails to respond to the identification signal, it is then declared as a hostile.\n*Battle Management System (Similar to the Inter-Vehicular Information System used in the United States military) allows the vehicle to share its data with friendly units, including other armored vehicles and helicopters.\n\nWork is also under way to integrate the [[XAV|experimental autonomous vehicles]], unmanned wheeled reconnaissance vehicle into the Black Panther's systems, giving the tank's crew the ability to remotely scout an area without exposing its position.\n\n== K2 product improvement program ==\nThe K2 PIP is an improved version of the initial production model of the K2 that will be released within the next few years. Improvements will include:\n\n* Upgrading the Semi-Active In-arm Suspension Unit to an Active In-arm Suspension Unit\n* Integration of a high-resolution terrain-scanning system to the vehicle's suspension system. This is purported to allow the vehicle to \"plan ahead\" by scanning nearby terrain up to 50 meters away in all directions and calculate the optimal position of the bogies in order to improve vehicle handling over uneven terrain.\n* Integration of a hard-kill anti-missile system.\n* Addition of [[Reactive armour#Non-explosive and non-energetic reactive armour|Non-Explosive Reactive Armor]].\n* Potentially replacing the 120&nbsp;mm / L55 gun with an [[Electrothermal-chemical technology|electrothermal-chemical gun]], which will significantly increase the vehicle's firepower and potential payload.\n\n=== Korean Active Protection System ===\nThe Korean Active Protection System is an indigenously developed hard-kill [[active protection system]] designed to protect the K2 from anti-tank threats.  It uses a three-dimensional detection and tracking radar and a thermal imager to detect incoming threats.  Warheads can be detected out to 150 meters from the tank, and a defensive rocket is fired to destroy them at 10\u201315 meters away.  The system can neutralize [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s and [[anti-tank guided missile]]s.  It may be installed on other platforms in the future like warships, helicopters, and buildings.  Unit price per system is [[South Korean won|\u20a9]]670 million ($600,000).<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120228/DEFREG02/302280010/S-Korea-Develops-Active-Protection-System-Armor S.

Developed as a modern main battle tank that will replace most of the remaining [[M48 Patton#South Korean|M48 Patton]] tanks and complement the [[K1 88-Tank|K1]] series of main battle tanks currently fielded by the [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|South Korean military]], the K2 Black Panther combines an auto-loaded 55 calibre 120 mm main gun, advanced composite armour along with hard and soft-kill [[Active protection system|active protection systems]].

The objective of this development program was to further modernize the [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean army]], despite the superior capability of existing [[K1 88-Tank|K1 and K1A1]] designs versus North Korean tanks, most of which are aging [[T-55]]s and [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]]s. Emphasis upon indigenous technologies would also allow the proposed vehicle to enter the export market without licensing difficulties.\n\nEarly design variants included a version with an unmanned turret, which was later scrapped in favor of manned turret designs. It was also planned for the vehicle to be equipped with [[Rheinmetall]]'s experimental 140&nbsp;mm smoothbore gun, though the K2 was subsequently reconfigured for the [[Rheinmetall 120&nbsp;mm gun|120&nbsp;mm/L55]] when Rheinmetall ceased development of the new weapon, determining that the 120&nbsp;mm/L55 would be more than capable of defeating prospective armored threats into the foreseeable future. The 120&nbsp;mm/L55 is equipped with a 6.6 m-length barrel that is {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} longer than the 120 mm main gun in the K1A1. This results in a higher muzzle velocity of {{convert|1,400|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} for greater accuracy and armor penetration (compared to {{convert|1,140|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} for the K1A1). The K2's autoloader also allows it to reload its main gun more quickly compared to its predecessor.\n\nThe K2 is capable of [[deep wading|fording]] {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}-depth rivers, is equipped with a posture control function that can tilt the chassis or lower its overall height by {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} and deploys a laser warning system that can turn the turret towards the source of hostile fire almost instantaneously.<ref>[http://www.mnd.go.kr/user/boardList.action?command=view&page=1&boardId=O_47261&boardSeq=O_104438&titleId=null&id=mnd_eng_030100000000 True worth of masterwork, \"great power\" during performance demonstration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016214630/http://www.mnd.go.kr/user/boardList.action?command=view&page=1&boardId=O_47261&boardSeq=O_104438&titleId=null&id=mnd_eng_030100000000 |date=2014-10-16 }} - MND.go.kr, 8 October 2014</ref>\n\n===Engines and powertrains===\n\nIn March 2011, South Korea's [[Defense Acquisition Program Administration]] (DAPA) announced that mass production of the K2, which the Army was expecting to deploy in 2012, would not happen due to problems concerning its engine and transmission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/03/116_83997.html|title=Made-in-Korea arms struggle with defects|publisher=The Korea Times|date=28 March 2011|author=Lee Tae-hoon|access-date=29 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002074000/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/03/116_83997.html|archive-date=2 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In April 2012, DAPA announced that due to ongoing issues with the reliability and durability of the domestically-produced powerpack, the first 100 production K2s would use German-made MTU powerpack and that service entry would be delayed until March 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/04/116_108229.html|title=Korea to buy German engines for K2 tanks|publisher=The Korea Times|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=3 April 2012|author=Lee Tae-hoon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403122431/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/04/116_108229.html|archive-date=3 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe first 15 K2 Black Panther tanks were put into service in June 2014.

The tank has a total ammunition capacity of 40 rounds for its main armament.\n\nSecondary weapons include a 12.7&nbsp;mm [[M2 Browning|K6 Machine Gun]] heavy machine gun and a 7.62&nbsp;mm coaxial machine gun.\n\n=== Fire-control system and optics ===\nThe K2 is equipped with an advanced [[fire-control system]] linked to an [[Extremely High Frequency]] [[radar]] system deployed on the frontal arc of the turret, along with a traditional [[laser rangefinder]] and crosswind sensor. The system is capable of a \"lock-on\" mode, which can acquire and track specific targets up to a range of {{convert|9.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} using a [[thermographic camera]]. This allows the crew to fire accurately while moving as well as engage low-flying aircraft.\n\nThe fire-control system is also linked to an advanced gun stabilizer and trigger-delay mechanism to optimise accuracy while moving in uneven terrain. If the trigger on the main gun is pulled at the same time the tank encounters an irregularity in the terrain, oscillation of the gun barrel will cause temporary misalignment between a laser emitter at the top of the barrel and a sensor at the base. This will delay the fire-control system from activating until the beam is re-aligned, improving the chances of hitting the intended target.\n\nThe Korean Gunner's Primary Sight (KGPS) and the [[Korean Commander's Panoramic Sight]] (KCPS) are present in the Black Panther as in the original series of K1A1 tanks, though modified to utilise the more advanced sensors and armaments deployed on the K2.\n\nThe commander of the tank has the ability to override the command to take control of the turret and gun from the gunner. Moreover, unconfirmed reports state that, in the event of an emergency, the vehicle can be operated by only two crew members, or even a single one. It is speculated that the fire-control system can automatically spot and track visible targets, compare them using the data link established with other friendly vehicles to prevent redundant target engagements, and fire its main gun without manual input.\n[[File:2014 \ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d \ubc29\uc704\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc804(DX Korea) \uc721\uad70\uc758 \uba85\ud488 \ubb34\uae30\uc640 \uc7a5\ube44 \uc18c\uac1c (15393852929).jpg|thumb|250px|K-2 tank on display along with its APFSDS munition rounds and K6 heavy machine gun rounds.]]\n\n=== Munitions ===\nThe K2's primary anti-tank munition is an indigenously developed improved [[tungsten]] [[APFSDS]] [[kinetic energy penetrator]]. For attacking unhardened targets, the K2 can use a multi-purpose [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|HEAT]] chemical energy round, similar to the U.S. [[M830]]A1 HEAT MP-T, providing good offensive capabilities against personnel, unarmored and lightly armored vehicles on the ground as well as low-flying helicopters.\n\nThe Korean Smart Top-Attack Munition ([[KSTAM]]) is a [[fire-and-forget]], top-attack anti-tank munition with an effective operating range of {{convert|2\u20138|km|mi|abbr=on}}, developed specifically for use with the K2. It is launched as a kinetic energy projectile, fired from the main gun in a high trajectory profile comparable to that of a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]. Upon reaching its designated target area, a parachute deploys, giving on-board [[millimeter band]] [[radar]], [[infrared]] and [[radiometer]] sensors time to seek and acquire stationary or moving targets. When a target is acquired, an [[explosively formed penetrator]] is fired from a top-down position, to exploit the weaker top armor of tanks. Target acquisition can also be directed manually by the tank crew via a remote link. These characteristics allow the launch vehicle to remain concealed behind cover while firing successive rounds towards the known location of an enemy, or provide effective indirect fire support against targets hidden behind obstacles and structures.\n\n== Defensive capabilities ==\n[[File:20\uc0ac\ub2e8 \ub0a8\ud55c\uac15 \ud639\ud55c\uae30 \ud6c8\ub828- (1) (24487615636).jpg|thumb|250px|K-2 tanks deploy smoke grenades during a manoeuvre drill.]]\nDetails of the composite armor of the Black Panther are classified. The frontal armor has been claimed to be effective against the 120&nbsp;mm APFSDS round fired from the [[L55]] gun.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Explosive Reactive Armor]] blocks are also present, with the addition of [[Reactive armour|Non-Explosive Reactive Armor]] planned for the K2 PIP (Product Improvement Program) version.\n\nDefense against incoming missiles is provided by a soft-kill anti-missile system.\n\nThe millimeter band radar system mounted on the turret is capable of operating as a [[Missile Approach Warning]] System (MAWS). The vehicle's computer in turn can triangulate incoming projectiles, immediately warn the vehicle crew and fire off [[Smoke screen|Visual and Infrared Screening Smoke]] (VIRSS) grenades, which can effectively block optical, infrared and radar signatures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Once the hard-kill AMS is installed, the radar system will also be responsible for tracking and targeting the incoming missiles for the AMS.\n\nThe K2 also has a [[Radar Warning Receiver]] (RWR) and [[radar jammer]]. Four all-bearing [[Laser warning receiver]]s (LWR) are also present to alert the crew should the vehicle become \"painted\", and the computer can also deploy VIRSS grenades towards the direction of the beam.\n\nAn [[automatic fire suppression]] system is programmed to detect and put out any internal fires that may occur, and atmospheric sensors alert the crew if the tank enters a hazardous environment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Mobility and maneuverability ==\n[[File:2014_%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD_%EB%B0%A9%EC%9C%84%EC%82%B0%EC%97%85%EC%A0%84%28DX_Korea%29_%EC%9C%A1%EA%B5%B0%EC%9D%98_%EB%AA%85%ED%92%88_%EB%AC%B4%EA%B8%B0%EC%99%80_%EC%9E%A5%EB%B9%84_%EC%86%8C%EA%B0%9C_%2815556786856%29.jpg|thumb|250px|K2 tank about to cross a water pool submerged with snorkel]]\nThe K2 can travel at speeds of up to 70&nbsp;km/h on road surfaces, accelerate from 0 to 32&nbsp;km/h within 8.7 seconds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hankookilbo.com/v/7be857028eda4f758e3e4b89d20f1897|title=\"\ud0f1\ud06c \uac00\uc18d\uc131\ub2a5 \uae30\uc900 \uc644\ud654\" \u8ecd, K2 \uad6d\uc0b0\ud654 \uc644\ub8cc \uac00\ub2e5|work=hankookilbo.com|accessdate=7 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306094221/http://hankookilbo.com/v/7be857028eda4f758e3e4b89d20f1897|archive-date=6 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunyerang.com/archives/857|title=sunyerang.com|work=sunyerang.com|accessdate=7 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006091057/http://www.sunyerang.com/archives/857|archivedate=6 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bemil.chosun.com/nbrd/bbs/view.html?b_bbs_id=10040&pn=1&num=81034|title=\ud751\ud45c\uc5d4\uc9c4 \uac00\uc18d\uc131\ub2a5 2011\ub144\uc5d0\ub3c4 8.77\ucd08 \ub098\uc628\uac70 \uac19\uc740\ub370\uc694.|last=BEMIL|access-date=2014-10-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007145939/http://bemil.chosun.com/nbrd/bbs/view.html?b_bbs_id=10040&pn=1&num=81034|archive-date=2014-10-07|url-status=live}}</ref> and maintain speeds of up to 52&nbsp;km/h in off-road conditions. It can also climb 60-degree slopes and vertical obstacles 1.8 meters in height. Due to the relatively compact design of the engine, the designers were able to fit an additional Samsung Techwin gas-turbine engine into the remaining compartment space. This is capable of producing {{convert|100|hp}}, and intended to act as an auxiliary power unit with which the tank may power its on-board systems when its main engines are turned off. It will also allow the tank to conserve fuel when idling and minimise the vehicle's thermal and acoustic signatures.\n\nThe vehicle can cross rivers as deep as 4.1 meters using a snorkel system, which also serves as a conning tower for the tank commander. The system takes approximately 20~30 minutes to prepare. The turret becomes watertight while fording, but the chassis can take in 500 gallons of water to prevent excessive buoyancy from air inside the vehicle and keep the tracks planted firmly on the ground. Furthermore, the tank can enter combat-ready status as soon as it resurfaces. It is said that K2's predecessor, K1, can cross a river of 2 meter depth after 2 hours of preparation, which also requires assistance from military engineers. However, a K2 tank does not require outside assistance for river crossing.\n\nThe Black Panther fields an advanced suspension system, called the In-arm Suspension Unit (ISU), which allows for individual control of every bogie on the tracks. This allows the K2 to \"sit\", \"stand\" and \"kneel\", as well as \"lean\" towards one side or a corner. \"Sitting\" gives the tank a lower profile and offers superior handling over roads. \"Standing\" gives the vehicle higher ground clearance for maneuverability over rough terrain. \"Kneeling\" augments the angular range in which the tank's gun barrel can elevate and depress, allowing the vehicle to fire its main gun downhill as well as engage low-flying aircraft more effectively. The suspension unit also cushions the chassis from vibrations when travelling over uneven terrain, as the bogies can be adjusted individually on-the-fly.\n\nUsing the suspension system, K2 is able to elevate its main gun up to 24 degrees, which allows a curved trajectory attack at a hovering helicopter target {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20141003500213|title=[\uc2e0\uc778\uade0\uc758 \ubc00\ub9ac\ud130\ub9ac \ub974\ud3ec] K-2\ud751\ud45c\uc804\ucc28\uc640 \uae30\ub3d9\uad70\ub2e8|work=seoul.co.kr|accessdate=7 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629140055/http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20141003500213|archive-date=29 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe K2 also has advanced track system called Dynamic Track Tensioning System. DTTS allows computer to keep the track's tension optimally by constantly changing its suspension automatically, making it hard to breakaway even in extreme maneuver.\n\n== Network-centric considerations ==\nThe K2 houses the following features which help to improve situational awareness for the crew:\n\n*[[C4I]] (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) uplink.\n*[[GPS]] (Global Positioning Satellite) uplink.\n*[[Identification Friend or Foe|IFF/SIF]] (Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature) system compliant with [[STANAG]] 4579. Located on the main gun mantlet, just above the gun, the system fires a 38&nbsp;GHz beam in the direction of the gun for a response from the targeted vehicle. If a proper response signal is shown by the target, the fire control system automatically identifies it as a friendly. If the target fails to respond to the identification signal, it is then declared as a hostile.\n*Battle Management System (Similar to the Inter-Vehicular Information System used in the United States military) allows the vehicle to share its data with friendly units, including other armored vehicles and helicopters.\n\nWork is also under way to integrate the [[XAV|experimental autonomous vehicles]], unmanned wheeled reconnaissance vehicle into the Black Panther's systems, giving the tank's crew the ability to remotely scout an area without exposing its position.\n\n== K2 product improvement program ==\nThe K2 PIP is an improved version of the initial production model of the K2 that will be released within the next few years. Improvements will include:\n\n* Upgrading the Semi-Active In-arm Suspension Unit to an Active In-arm Suspension Unit\n* Integration of a high-resolution terrain-scanning system to the vehicle's suspension system. This is purported to allow the vehicle to \"plan ahead\" by scanning nearby terrain up to 50 meters away in all directions and calculate the optimal position of the bogies in order to improve vehicle handling over uneven terrain.\n* Integration of a hard-kill anti-missile system.\n* Addition of [[Reactive armour#Non-explosive and non-energetic reactive armour|Non-Explosive Reactive Armor]].\n* Potentially replacing the 120&nbsp;mm / L55 gun with an [[Electrothermal-chemical technology|electrothermal-chemical gun]], which will significantly increase the vehicle's firepower and potential payload.\n\n=== Korean Active Protection System ===\nThe Korean Active Protection System is an indigenously developed hard-kill [[active protection system]] designed to protect the K2 from anti-tank threats.  It uses a three-dimensional detection and tracking radar and a thermal imager to detect incoming threats.  Warheads can be detected out to 150 meters from the tank, and a defensive rocket is fired to destroy them at 10\u201315 meters away.  The system can neutralize [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s and [[anti-tank guided missile]]s.  It may be installed on other platforms in the future like warships, helicopters, and buildings.  Unit price per system is [[South Korean won|\u20a9]]670 million ($600,000).<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120228/DEFREG02/302280010/S-Korea-Develops-Active-Protection-System-Armor S.

A relative latecomer to the sport, Cowan did not play football until he was 17 and was 22 by the time he turned professional. He made his league debut for [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in 1923, and signed for [[Football League First Division|First Division]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] the following season.\n\nCowan played [[defender (football)|centre half]] for Manchester City for 11&nbsp;seasons, captaining the team in the early to mid-1930s. He is the only player to have represented Manchester City in three [[FA Cup]] finals, as a runner-up in [[1926 FA Cup Final|1926]] and [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]], and as a winner in [[1934 FA Cup Final|1934]]. Internationally, he gained three [[England national football team|England]] [[Cap (sport)|caps]] between 1926 and 1931. In total he played 407&nbsp;times for Manchester City, putting him 12th in terms of all-time appearances. In 1935, he transferred to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], and subsequently moved to [[Mossley A.F.C.|Mossley]] as [[player-manager]].\n\nIn 1938, Cowan joined [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] as a coach, and set up a physiotherapy business. He returned to Manchester City as manager in 1946, winning the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in his only season in charge. He continued to work in sports and physiotherapy until his death in 1964.\n\n==Football career==\n===Early career===\nCowan was born on 10 May 1901 in [[Chesterfield]], but moved further north in his early years and was raised in [[Adwick le Street]] near [[Doncaster]].<ref name=\"halloffame\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p.&nbsp;152.</ref> He did not play football as a child, only gaining an interest in the sport when he took part in a game at a local park aged 17.<ref name=\"azmanc\">{{cite book |last=Brandon |first=Derek <!--Invalid ISBN |isbn=0-86148-001-7 -->|ol=13768775M  | title=A\u2013Z of Manchester Football: 100 Years of Rivalry |publisher=Boondoggle |location=London |year=1978|page= 46}}</ref> He then started to play for local teams, including Adwick Juniors, [[Bullcroft Main Colliery F.C.|Bullcroft Main Colliery]] and [[Denaby United F.C.|Denaby United]] and had an unsuccessful trial at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].<ref name=\"halloffame\"/>\n\nIn 1923, Cowan gained his first professional contract following a successful trial at his local league club, [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] of the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division (North)]].<ref name=\"halloffame\"/> Despite playing as a defender, during his time at Doncaster he scored regularly, including a [[hat-trick]] of headed goals against [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] in March 1924.<ref name=\"Clayton\">{{cite book |first=David |last=Clayton |title=Everything Under the Blue Moon |isbn=1-84018-687-9 | publisher=Mainstream Publishing |year=2002 |page= 60}}</ref> His performances gained the attention of bigger clubs, and in December 1924 he joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], who sought a successor to the likes of [[Mick Hamill]] and [[Max Woosnam]].<ref name=\"mre\">{{cite book |last=Penney |first=Ian |title=The Maine Road Encyclopedia |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |location=Edinburgh |year=1995 |isbn=1-85158-710-1 |pages= 49\u201350}}</ref>\n\n===Manchester City===\nCowan made his Manchester City debut in a 2\u20132 draw against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 20 December 1924,<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn=1-85983-512-0 |page= 169}}</ref> and scored his first goal for the club two weeks later, against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He played in all but one of the remaining league matches that season, 21 in total.\n\nStarting all but four of Manchester City's matches in the [[1925-26 in English football|1925\u201326 season]], Cowan was a key part of the team which reached the [[1926 FA Cup Final]], winning several ties by wide margins en route. However, in the final City were beaten 1\u20130 by [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. Further disappointment followed in the [[English football league system|league]], when after a campaign characterised by erratic form, City were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] on the final day of the season. By this time Cowan's reputation as a competent centre-back had grown, and he received an international call-up. He made his [[England national football team|England]] debut on 24 May 1926 playing an unfamiliar left-half role in a 5\u20133 win against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].<ref name=\"hof156\"/> By 1931, he had earned three international [[cap (sport)|caps]], the others gained in matches against [[France national football team|France]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.englandstats.com/playerreport.php?pid=266\n|title=Sam Cowan\n|accessdate=11 May 2008\n|publisher=Englandstats.com}}</ref> He also made appearances for the [[The Football League XI|Football League team]], including a trial match against England in 1931.\n\nIn the [[1926-27 in English football|1926\u201327 season]], Cowan made 27 appearances as his club sought an immediate return to the top division. The race for promotion went to the final match, with Manchester City and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] both in contention for the second of the two promotion places. Cowan played in a resounding City win, an 8\u20130 victory against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]. The watching crowd believed the result to be sufficient for promotion, but Portsmouth's match had been delayed by 15 minutes and was still in progress. A late Portsmouth goal meant the final scoreline in their match was a 5\u20131 win, enough to give Portsmouth second place on [[goal average]] by a margin of one two-hundredth of a goal.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p.&nbsp;116.</ref> The club won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] championship the following season, gaining [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the top flight. The Second Division championship was Cowan's first honour in professional football.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Cowan became Manchester City captain, succeeding [[Jimmy McMullan]]. During his captaincy the club reached two further [[FA Cup Final]]s. The first of these was in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]], against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. During the match Cowan was up against Everton captain [[Dixie Dean]]. Both players were renowned for their heading ability. [[Matt Busby]] claimed that Cowan could \"head a ball as far as most of us could kick it\",<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p.&nbsp;170.</ref> but Dean prevailed in the aerial battle, scoring Everton's second goal with a header. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' observed that Dean's presence gave Cowan a dilemma: \"He was torn between a determination not to leave Dean and a desire to help his forwards. He broke down between the two.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=Gary | last=James| coauthors= | title=Manchester: The Greatest City | publisher=Polar | location=Leicester | year=2002 | editor= | isbn=1-899538-22-4}} p136</ref> Everton were 3\u20130 victors, but when Cowan received his runner's up medal from the [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Duke of York]], he remarked that he would come back next year to win.<ref>Some sources mistakenly state that the remark was made to [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], who did not attend the 1933 final.</ref> True to Cowan's word, City returned to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] the following year.

Cowan made his debut for them on 19 October 1935 in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], but it was not until Cowan's third game that Bradford won for the second time that season.

A relative latecomer to the sport, Cowan did not play football until he was 17 and was 22 by the time he turned professional. He made his league debut for [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in 1923, and signed for [[Football League First Division|First Division]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] the following season.\n\nCowan played [[defender (football)|centre half]] for Manchester City for 11&nbsp;seasons, captaining the team in the early to mid-1930s. He is the only player to have represented Manchester City in three [[FA Cup]] finals, as a runner-up in [[1926 FA Cup Final|1926]] and [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]], and as a winner in [[1934 FA Cup Final|1934]]. Internationally, he gained three [[England national football team|England]] [[Cap (sport)|caps]] between 1926 and 1931. In total he played 407&nbsp;times for Manchester City, putting him 12th in terms of all-time appearances. In 1935, he transferred to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], and subsequently moved to [[Mossley A.F.C.|Mossley]] as [[player-manager]].\n\nIn 1938, Cowan joined [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] as a coach, and set up a physiotherapy business. He returned to Manchester City as manager in 1946, winning the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in his only season in charge. He continued to work in sports and physiotherapy until his death in 1964.\n\n==Football career==\n===Early career===\nCowan was born on 10 May 1901 in [[Chesterfield]], but moved further north in his early years and was raised in [[Adwick le Street]] near [[Doncaster]].<ref name=\"halloffame\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p.&nbsp;152.</ref> He did not play football as a child, only gaining an interest in the sport when he took part in a game at a local park aged 17.<ref name=\"azmanc\">{{cite book |last=Brandon |first=Derek <!--Invalid ISBN |isbn=0-86148-001-7 -->|ol=13768775M  | title=A\u2013Z of Manchester Football: 100 Years of Rivalry |publisher=Boondoggle |location=London |year=1978|page= 46}}</ref> He then started to play for local teams, including Adwick Juniors, [[Bullcroft Main Colliery F.C.|Bullcroft Main Colliery]] and [[Denaby United F.C.|Denaby United]] and had an unsuccessful trial at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].<ref name=\"halloffame\"/>\n\nIn 1923, Cowan gained his first professional contract following a successful trial at his local league club, [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] of the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division (North)]].<ref name=\"halloffame\"/> Despite playing as a defender, during his time at Doncaster he scored regularly, including a [[hat-trick]] of headed goals against [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] in March 1924.<ref name=\"Clayton\">{{cite book |first=David |last=Clayton |title=Everything Under the Blue Moon |isbn=1-84018-687-9 | publisher=Mainstream Publishing |year=2002 |page= 60}}</ref> His performances gained the attention of bigger clubs, and in December 1924 he joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], who sought a successor to the likes of [[Mick Hamill]] and [[Max Woosnam]].<ref name=\"mre\">{{cite book |last=Penney |first=Ian |title=The Maine Road Encyclopedia |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |location=Edinburgh |year=1995 |isbn=1-85158-710-1 |pages= 49\u201350}}</ref>\n\n===Manchester City===\nCowan made his Manchester City debut in a 2\u20132 draw against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 20 December 1924,<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn=1-85983-512-0 |page= 169}}</ref> and scored his first goal for the club two weeks later, against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He played in all but one of the remaining league matches that season, 21 in total.\n\nStarting all but four of Manchester City's matches in the [[1925-26 in English football|1925\u201326 season]], Cowan was a key part of the team which reached the [[1926 FA Cup Final]], winning several ties by wide margins en route. However, in the final City were beaten 1\u20130 by [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. Further disappointment followed in the [[English football league system|league]], when after a campaign characterised by erratic form, City were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] on the final day of the season. By this time Cowan's reputation as a competent centre-back had grown, and he received an international call-up. He made his [[England national football team|England]] debut on 24 May 1926 playing an unfamiliar left-half role in a 5\u20133 win against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].<ref name=\"hof156\"/> By 1931, he had earned three international [[cap (sport)|caps]], the others gained in matches against [[France national football team|France]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.englandstats.com/playerreport.php?pid=266\n|title=Sam Cowan\n|accessdate=11 May 2008\n|publisher=Englandstats.com}}</ref> He also made appearances for the [[The Football League XI|Football League team]], including a trial match against England in 1931.\n\nIn the [[1926-27 in English football|1926\u201327 season]], Cowan made 27 appearances as his club sought an immediate return to the top division. The race for promotion went to the final match, with Manchester City and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] both in contention for the second of the two promotion places. Cowan played in a resounding City win, an 8\u20130 victory against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]. The watching crowd believed the result to be sufficient for promotion, but Portsmouth's match had been delayed by 15 minutes and was still in progress. A late Portsmouth goal meant the final scoreline in their match was a 5\u20131 win, enough to give Portsmouth second place on [[goal average]] by a margin of one two-hundredth of a goal.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p.&nbsp;116.</ref> The club won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] championship the following season, gaining [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the top flight. The Second Division championship was Cowan's first honour in professional football.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Cowan became Manchester City captain, succeeding [[Jimmy McMullan]]. During his captaincy the club reached two further [[FA Cup Final]]s. The first of these was in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]], against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. During the match Cowan was up against Everton captain [[Dixie Dean]]. Both players were renowned for their heading ability. [[Matt Busby]] claimed that Cowan could \"head a ball as far as most of us could kick it\",<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p.&nbsp;170.</ref> but Dean prevailed in the aerial battle, scoring Everton's second goal with a header. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' observed that Dean's presence gave Cowan a dilemma: \"He was torn between a determination not to leave Dean and a desire to help his forwards. He broke down between the two.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=Gary | last=James| coauthors= | title=Manchester: The Greatest City | publisher=Polar | location=Leicester | year=2002 | editor= | isbn=1-899538-22-4}} p136</ref> Everton were 3\u20130 victors, but when Cowan received his runner's up medal from the [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Duke of York]], he remarked that he would come back next year to win.<ref>Some sources mistakenly state that the remark was made to [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], who did not attend the 1933 final.</ref> True to Cowan's word, City returned to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] the following year. In the [[1934 FA Cup Final]], Cowan became the first and thus far only Manchester City player to represent the club in three FA Cup finals.<ref>James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p.&nbsp;153.</ref> He captained City to a 2\u20131 victory over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. As team captain Cowan held primary responsibility for motivating his fellow players and match tactics.<ref name=\"Kelly\">{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Graham |title=Terrace Heroes: The Life and Times of the 1930s Professional Footballer |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=0-7146-5359-4 |page= 94}}</ref> This was typical for a captain of his era, as [[Coach (sport)|managers]] of the period were chiefly administrators who had little input into coaching and tactics.<ref name=\"Kelly\"/>\n\nCowan's final season at [[Maine Road]] was [[1934-35 in English football|1934\u201335]], in which he was ever-present. His final match for the club was a 5\u20130 defeat of [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 4 May 1935.<ref>James, ''Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record'', p.&nbsp;348.</ref> In total he made 407 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 24 goals. As of 2008 he ranks 12th all-time for Manchester City appearances. [[Bob Donnelly]] was signed to replace him in the 1935 close season, and [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] signed Cowan for a fee of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]2,000 in October 1935. At the time the transfer fee was the second highest ever paid by the club.<ref name=\"hof156\">James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p.&nbsp;156.</ref>\n\n===Bradford City===\nBradford City were struggling in the [[Football League Division Two|Second Division]] at the time of Cowan's signing, having won just one of their first ten games of the [[1935-36 in English football|1935\u201336]] season. Cowan made his debut for them on 19 October 1935 in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], but it was not until Cowan's third game that Bradford won for the second time that season. Cowan missed just three of the club's remaining fixtures that season, playing 29 times in the league and three in the FA Cup as City finished 12th.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Frost\n|first=Terry\n|title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n|publisher=Breedon Books Sport\n|year=1988\n|pages=226\u2013227\n|isbn=0-907969-38-0}}</ref> The following season, City again struggled. Cowan missed just one of the first 23 games, but after Christmas, he was restricted to just six; and without Cowan, Bradford finished 21st and were relegated to the Third Division (North).<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Frost\n|title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n|pages=228\u2013229}}</ref>\n\n===Managerial career===\nIn 1937, Cowan was appointed player-manager at [[Mossley A.F.C.|Mossley]]. He led the club to the seventh place in the [[Cheshire County League|Cheshire League]] and to the [[Manchester Challenge Shield]] title. On the pitch, he played 39 matches and scored one goal.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.mossleyweb.com/Managers1.htm\n|title=The Mossley Managers\n|accessdate=12 May 2008\n|publisher=Mossley AFC}}</ref> At the end of the season Cowan resigned to join [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] coaching staff. In October 1945, a shortage of players resulted in Cowan taking to the field in a wartime match against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]]. Aged 44 years and 156 days, he became the oldest ever Brighton player.<ref>{{cite news\n |title      = Seagulls move for Beasant\n |url        = http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/5117287.Seagulls_move_for_Beasant/\n |publisher  = The Argus\n |date       = 30 January 2003\n |accessdate = 13 December 2017\n}}</ref> While at Brighton, Cowan started a [[physiotherapy]] business based near the [[Goldstone Ground]].<ref name=\"Clayton\"/>\n\nIn November 1946, Cowan became Manchester City manager, succeeding [[Wilf Wild]], who moved to a purely administrative role.<ref name=\"mre\"/> Cowan had been known for his motivational skills as a player, and was part of a new generation of managers who took responsibility for tactics and team selection, of which Cowan's contemporary and former teammate [[Matt Busby]] became the most well-known.

Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into camps headed by Marx and Bakunin.<ref>\"It is unnecessary to repeat the accounts of the Geneva and Hague Congresses of the International in which the issues between Marx and Bakunin were fought out and the organisation itself split apart into the dying Marxist rump centered around the New York General Council and the anti-authoritarian majority centred around the Bakuninist Jura Federation. But it is desirable to consider some of the factors underlying the final emergence of a predominantly anarchist International in 1872.\" [[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962). p. 243.</ref> The clearest differences between the groups emerged over their proposed strategies for achieving their visions. The First International became the first major international forum for the promulgation of socialist ideas.\n\nBakunin's followers were called [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] and sought to collectivise ownership of the means of production while retaining payment proportional to the amount and kind of labour of each individual. Like Proudhonists, they asserted the right of each individual to the product of his labour and to be remunerated for his particular contribution to production. By contrast, [[anarcho-communists]] sought collective ownership of both the means and the products of labour. [[Errico Malatesta]] put it: \"[I]nstead of running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I each do, let us all work and put everything in common. In this way each will give to society all that his strength permits until enough is produced for every one; and each will take all that he needs, limiting his needs only in those things of which there is not yet plenty for every one\".<ref name=\"dwardmac.pitzer.edu\">{{cite web |title=A Talk About Anarchist Communism Between Two Workers |author=Errico Malatesta |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_Archives/malatesta/MalatestaATAC.html |website=Anarchy Archives |accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref> Anarcho-communism as a coherent economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the First International by Malatesta, [[Carlo Cafiero]], [[Emilio Covelli]], [[Andrea Costa]] and other ex-[[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzinian]] republicans.<ref name=\"Nunzio Pernicious pp. 111-113\">Nunzio Pernicone, \"Italian Anarchism 1864\u20131892\", pp. 111\u201313, AK Press 2009.</ref> Out of respect for Bakunin, they did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after his death.<ref name=\"marxists.org\">James Guillaume, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/bakunin.htm \"Michael Bakunin \u2013 A Biographical Sketch\"]</ref>\n\n[[Syndicalism]] emerged in France inspired in part by Proudhon and later by Pelloutier and [[Georges Sorel]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551569/socialism \"Socialism\"] at ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]''</ref> It developed at the end of the 19th century out of the French trade-union movement (''syndicat'' is the French word for trade union).

In 1889 (the centennial of the French Revolution), the [[Second International]] was founded, with 384 delegates from twenty countries representing about 300 labour and socialist organisations.<ref>[http://www.marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/secondinternational.html ''The Second (Socialist) International 1889\u20131923''].

Revolutionary socialists quickly targeted reformism: [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Social Reform or Revolution]]?'' [[Revolutionary socialism]] encompasses multiple social and political movements that may define \"revolution\" differently. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections, it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels.

Workers, soldiers and peasants established [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] (councils), the monarchy fell and a [[Provisional Government of Russia, 1917|provisional government]] convened pending the election of a [[constituent assembly]]. In April of that year, [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|socialists in Russia]] and known for his [[Leninism|profound and controversial expansions]] of [[Marxism]], was allowed to cross Germany to return from exile in Switzerland.\n\nLenin had published [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|essays]] on his analysis of [[Leninism#Imperialism|imperialism]], the monopoly and [[globalisation]] phase of capitalism, as well as analyses on social conditions. He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain [[class consciousness]] so long as they were too busy working to pay their expenses. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_leninscritique.html |title=Commanding Heights: Lenin's Critique of Global Capitalism |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nUpon arriving in [[Petrograd]], Lenin declared that the revolution in Russia had only begun, and that the next step was for the workers' [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s to take full authority. He issued a [[April Thesis|thesis]] outlining the Bolshevik programme, including rejection of any legitimacy in the provisional government and advocacy for state power to be administered through the soviets. The Bolsheviks became the most influential force. On 7 November, the [[Winter Palace|capitol of the provisional government]] was stormed by [[Red Guards (Russia)|Bolshevik Red Guards]] in what afterwards became known as the [[Great October Socialist Revolution]]. The provisional government ended and the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]]\u2014the world's first constitutionally socialist state\u2014was established.

By the 1980s, with the rise of conservative neoliberal politicians such as [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States, [[Margaret Thatcher]] in Britain, [[Brian Mulroney]] in Canada and [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile, the Western [[welfare state]] was attacked from within, but state support for the corporate sector was maintained.<ref>Gary Teeple (2000).

In the United Kingdom, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Neil Kinnock]] made a public attack against the [[Entryism|entryist]] group [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] at the 1985 Labour Party conference. The Labour Party ruled that Militant was ineligible for affiliation with the Labour Party, and the party gradually expelled Militant supporters. The Kinnock leadership had refused to support the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u20131985 miner's strike]] over pit closures, a decision that the party's left wing and the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] blamed for the strike's eventual defeat. In 1989 at Stockholm, the 18th Congress of the Socialist International adopted a new Declaration of Principles, saying: <blockquote>Democratic socialism is an international movement for freedom, social justice, and solidarity. Its goal is to achieve a peaceful world where these basic values can be enhanced and where each individual can live a meaningful life with the full development of his or her personality and talents, and with the guarantee of human and civil rights in a democratic framework of society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070726/http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html|url-status=dead|title=Socialist International \u2013 Progressive Politics for a Fairer World|archive-date=22 February 2008}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 1990s, the British Labour Party under [[Tony Blair]] enacted policies based on the free market economy to deliver public services via the [[private finance initiative]]. Influential in these policies was the idea of a \"[[Third Way]]\" which called for a re-evaluation of welfare state policies.<ref>Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?''. Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 3\u20134, 16.</ref> In 1995, the Labour Party re-defined its stance on socialism by re-wording [[Clause IV]] of its constitution, effectively rejecting socialism by removing all references to public, direct worker or municipal ownership of the means of production. The Labour Party stated: \"The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that, by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create, for each of us, the means to realise our true potential, and, for all of us, a community in which power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |title=Labour Party Clause Four |publisher=Labour.org.uk |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081023/http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |archivedate=11 July 2007 |df=}}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary socialist politics ==\n[[File:1989 CPA 6101.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first [[president of Ghana]] and theorist of [[African socialism]], on a [[Soviet Union]] commemorative postage stamp]]\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{main|African socialism}}\nAfrican socialism has been and continues to be a major ideology around the continent.

Essentially he believed Africans were already socialists. Other African socialists include [[Jomo Kenyatta]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. [[Fela Kuti]] was inspired by socialism and called for a democratic African republic. In South Africa the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) abandoned its partial socialist allegiances after taking power and followed a standard neoliberal route. From 2005 through to 2007, the country was wracked by many thousands of protests from poor communities. One of these gave rise to a mass movement of shack dwellers, [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] that despite major police suppression continues to work for popular people's planning and against the creation of a market economy in land and housing.\n\n=== Asia ===\n{{main|Arab socialism|History of the People's Republic of China|Socialist market economy|Socialist-oriented market economy}}\nIn Asia, states with socialist economies\u2014such as the People's Republic of China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam\u2014have largely moved away from centralised economic planning in the 21st century, placing a greater emphasis on markets.

For Marx and Engels, conditions determine consciousness and ending the role of the capitalist class leads eventually to a [[classless society]] in which the [[withering away of the state|state would wither away]]. The Marxist conception of socialism is that of a specific historical phase that would displace capitalism and precede [[communism]].

In contrast to Karl Marx's perspective of the state, Lassalle rejected the concept of the state as a class-based power structure whose main function was to preserve existing class structures. Lassalle also rejected the Marxist view that the state was destined to \"wither away\". Lassalle considered the state to be an entity independent of class allegiances and an instrument of justice that would therefore be essential for achieving socialism.{{sfn|Berlau|1949|p=21}}\n\nPreceding the Bolshevik-led revolution in Russia, many socialists including [[reformists]], [[orthodox Marxist]] currents such as [[council communism]], anarchists and [[libertarian socialists]] criticised the idea of using the state to conduct central planning and own the means of production as a way to establish socialism. Following the victory of Leninism in Russia, the idea of \"state socialism\" spread rapidly throughout the socialist movement and eventually state socialism came to be identified with the [[Soviet economic model]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Screpanti and Zamagni|title=An Outline on the History of Economic Thought |edition=2nd |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford|quote=It should not be forgotten, however, that in the period of the Second International, some of the reformist currents of Marxism, as well as some of the extreme left-wing ones, not to speak of the anarchist groups, had already criticised the view that State ownership and central planning is the best road to socialism. But with the victory of Leninism in Russia, all dissent was silenced, and socialism became identified with 'democratic centralism', 'central planning', and State ownership of the means of production. |ref=p. 295}}</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Schumpeter]] rejected the association of socialism and social ownership with state ownership over the means of production because the state as it exists in its current form is a product of capitalist society and cannot be transplanted to a different institutional framework. Schumpeter argued that there would be different institutions within socialism than those that exist within modern capitalism, just as [[feudalism]] had its own distinct and unique institutional forms. The state, along with concepts like [[Private property|property]] and [[taxation]], were concepts exclusive to commercial society (capitalism) and attempting to place them within the context of a future socialist society would amount to a distortion of these concepts by using them out of context.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy |publisher=Harper Perennial |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-06-156161-0 |page=169 |quote=But there are still others (concepts and institutions) which by virtue of their nature cannot stand transplantation and always carry the flavor of a particular institutional framework.

Similarly, modern [[intentional communities]] based on socialist ideas could also be categorised as \"utopian socialist\".\n\nFor Marxists, the development of capitalism in Western Europe provided a material basis for the possibility of bringing about socialism because according to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' \"[w]hat the bourgeoisie produces above all is its own grave diggers\",<ref>Marx and Engels, ''The Communist Manifesto''.</ref> namely the working class, which must become conscious of the historical objectives set it by society.\n\n=== Reform versus revolution ===\n{{main|Reformism|Revolutionary socialism}}\nRevolutionary socialists believe that a social revolution is necessary to effect structural changes to the socioeconomic structure of society. Among revolutionary socialists there are differences in strategy, theory and the definition of \"revolution\". Orthodox Marxists and left communists take an [[impossibilist]] stance, believing that revolution should be spontaneous as a result of contradictions in society due to technological changes in the productive forces. Lenin theorised that under capitalism the workers cannot achieve class consciousness beyond organising into [[trade union]]s and making demands of the capitalists. Therefore, [[Leninists]] advocate that it is historically necessary for a [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] of class conscious revolutionaries to take a central role in coordinating the social revolution to overthrow the capitalist state and eventually the institution of the state altogether.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Leninist Concept of the Revolutionary Vanguard Party |url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/socialistvoice/partyPR46.html |website=WRG |accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref> \"Revolution\" is not necessarily defined by revolutionary socialists as violent insurrection,<ref>Schaff, Adam, 'Marxist Theory on Revolution and Violence', p. 263. in Journal of the history of ideas, Vol 34, no. 2 (April\u2013June 1973)</ref> but as a complete dismantling and rapid transformation of all areas of class society led by the majority of the masses: the working class.\n\nReformism is generally associated with [[social democracy]] and [[gradualist]] democratic socialism.

A socialist form of organisation would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains. Every member would have decision-making power in the firm and would be able to participate in establishing its overall policy objectives. The policies/goals would be carried out by the technical specialists that form the coordinating hierarchy of the firm, who would establish plans or directives for the work community to accomplish these goals.<ref name=\"The Political Economy of Socialism, 1982. p. 197\">''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982.

In the second, technical decisions are made on the basis of technical competence and expertise. The decisions of the first sphere are policy directives; those of the second, technical directives. The former are based on political authority as exercised by all members of the organisation; the latter, on professional authority specific to each member and growing out of the division of labour. Such an organisation involves a clearly defined coordinating hierarchy but eliminates a power hierarchy.\"</ref>\n\nThe role and use of money in a hypothetical socialist economy is a contested issue.

Bolshevik revolutionary [[Leon Trotsky]] argued that money could not be arbitrarily abolished following a socialist revolution.

I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilised in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.| [[Albert Einstein]], ''[[Why Socialism?]]'', 1949<ref>[http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einstein.php ''Why Socialism?''] by [[Albert Einstein]], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', May 1949</ref>}}\n\n=== Planned economy ===\n{{main|Planned economy}}\nA planned economy is a type of economy consisting of a mixture of public ownership of the means of production and the coordination of production and distribution through [[economic planning]]. A planned economy can be either decentralised or centralised. [[Enrico Barone]] provided a comprehensive theoretical framework for a planned socialist economy. In his model, assuming perfect computation techniques, simultaneous equations relating inputs and outputs to ratios of equivalence would provide appropriate valuations in order to balance supply and demand.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gregory and Stuart|first=Paul and Robert|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition|publisher=George Hoffman|year=2004|isbn=978-0-618-26181-9|pages=120\u201321}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent example of a planned economy was the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic system of the Soviet Union]] and as such the centralised-planned economic model is usually associated with the [[communist state]]s of the 20th century, where it was combined with a single-party political system. In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency (see also the [[analysis of Soviet-type economic planning]]). The economic systems of the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] are further classified as \"command economies\", which are defined as systems where economic coordination is undertaken by commands, directives and production targets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ericson|first=Richard E.|title=Command Economy|url=http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf|website=|accessdate=9 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125010605/http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf|archivedate=25 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Studies by economists of various political persuasions on the actual functioning of the Soviet economy indicate that it was not actually a planned economy. Instead of conscious planning, the Soviet economy was based on a process whereby the plan was modified by localised agents and the original plans went largely unfulfilled. Planning agencies, ministries and enterprises all adapted and bargained with each other during the formulation of the plan as opposed to following a plan passed down from a higher authority, leading some economists to suggest that planning did not actually take place within the Soviet economy and that a better description would be an \"administered\" or \"managed\" economy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nove|first=Alec|title=The Economics of Feasible Socialism, Revisited|publisher=Routledge|year=1991|isbn=978-0-04-335049-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsoffeasi00nove/page/78 78]|quote=Several authors of the most diverse political views have stated that there is in fact no planning in the Soviet Union: Eugene Zaleski, J.

Leon Trotsky rejected central planning in favour of decentralised planning. He argued that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, would be unable to coordinate effectively all economic activity within an economy because they operated without the input and tacit knowledge embodied by the participation of the millions of people in the economy. As a result, central planners would be unable to respond to local economic conditions.<ref>''Writings 1932\u201333, p. 96'', Leon Trotsky.</ref> [[State socialism]] is unfeasible in this view because information cannot be aggregated by a central body and effectively used to formulate a plan for an entire economy, because doing so would result in [[Economic calculation problem|distorted or absent price signals]].<ref name=\"hayek\">F.

This model has found support in notable classical and neoclassical economists including [[Alfred Marshall]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Jaroslav Vanek]].

Typically it refers to a form of technocratic management, whereby technical specialists administer or manage economic enterprises on behalf of society (and the public interest) instead of workers' councils or workplace democracy.\n\nA state-directed economy may refer to a type of mixed economy consisting of public ownership over large industries, as promoted by various Social democratic political parties during the 20th century. This ideology influenced the policies of the British Labour Party during Clement Attlee's administration.

It is a system that uses the market and [[Price system|monetary prices]] for the allocation and accounting of the [[means of production]], thereby retaining the process of [[capital accumulation]]. The profit generated would be used to directly remunerate employees, collectively sustain the enterprise or finance public institutions.<ref>''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. p. 142: \"It is an economic system that combines social ownership of capital with market allocation of capital...The state owns the means of production, and returns accrue to society at large.\"</ref> In state-oriented forms of market socialism, in which state enterprises attempt to maximise profit, the profits can be used to fund government programs and services through a [[social dividend]], eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems.

Socialism, in Walras's view, entailed state ownership of land and natural resources and the abolition of income taxes. As owner of land and natural resources, the state could then lease these resources to many individuals and groups, which would eliminate monopolies and thus enable free competition. The leasing of land and natural resources would also provide enough state revenue to make income taxes unnecessary, allowing a worker to invest his savings and become 'an owner or capitalist at the same time that he remains a worker.}}</ref> Yugoslavia implemented a market socialist economy based on cooperatives and worker self-management.\n\n[[File:Proudhon-children.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], main theorist of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and influential French socialist thinker]]\n[[Mutualism (economy)|Mutualism]] is an [[Economics|economic theory]] and [[anarchist school of thought]] that advocates a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labour in the [[free market]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutualist.org/ |title=Introduction |publisher=Mutualist.org |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

Rappoport analysed forty definitions of socialism to conclude that common elements of socialism include: general criticisms of the social effects of [[private ownership]] and control of capital\u2014as being the cause of poverty, low wages, unemployment, economic and social inequality and a lack of economic security; a general view that the solution to these problems is a form of collective control over the [[means of production]], [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] and [[Means of exchange|exchange]] (the degree and means of control vary amongst socialist movements); an agreement that the outcome of this collective control should be a society based upon [[social justice]], including social equality, economic protection of people and should provide a more satisfying life for most people.<ref>{{harvnb|Lamb|Docherty|2006|pp=1\u20132}}</ref> In ''The Concepts of Socialism'' (1975), [[Bhikhu Parekh]] identifies four core principles of socialism and particularly socialist society: sociality, social responsibility, cooperation and planning.<ref name=\"Peter Lamb 2006. p. 2\">{{harvnb|Lamb|Docherty|2006|p=2}}</ref> In his study ''Ideologies and Political Theory'' (1996), [[Michael Freeden]] states that all socialists share five themes: the first is that socialism posits that society is more than a mere collection of individuals; second, that it considers human welfare a desirable objective; third, that it considers humans by nature to be active and productive; fourth, it holds the belief of human equality; and fifth, that history is progressive and will create positive change on the condition that humans work to achieve such change.<ref name=\"Peter Lamb 2006. p. 2\"/>\n\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{main|Anarchism}}\nAnarchism is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[Stateless society|stateless societies]] often defined as [[Self-governance|self-governed]] voluntary institutions,<ref>\"ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies.\" George Woodcock. \"Anarchism\" at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref><ref>\"In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions.\" [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin___Anarchism__from_the_Encyclopaedia_Britannica.html Peter Kropotkin. \"Anarchism\" from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]</ref><ref>\"Anarchism.\" The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. p. 14 \"Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.\"</ref><ref>Sheehan, Sean.

Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\" [[Benjamin Tucker]].

Some democratic socialists support [[social democracy]] as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane, while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is either completely forgotten or redefined in a pro-capitalist way. The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences.\n\nThe major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics: contemporary social democrats support a [[welfare state]] and unemployment insurance as a means to \"humanise\" capitalism, whereas democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to \"humanise\" capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice |year=2006 |url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labour movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanised, and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere. (E.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labour discipline breaks down; etc.)\"</ref>\n\nDemocratic socialism generally refers to any political movement that seeks to establish an economy based on [[economic democracy]] by and for the working class. Democratic socialism is difficult to define and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral, [[Reformism|reformist]] or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one.<ref>This definition is captured in this statement by [[Anthony Crosland]], who \"argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the [[Marxist]]s, but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant\". {{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Pierson |title=Lost property: What the Third Way lacks |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=145\u201363 |doi=10.1080/13569310500097265}} Other texts which use the terms \"democratic socialism\" in this way include Malcolm Hamilton ''Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden'' (St Martin's Press 1989).</ref>\n\n{{quotation|You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums.

Blanquism did not count on the [[direct action]] of the working class. It, therefore, did not need to organise the people for the revolution. The people were expected to play their part only at the moment of revolution. Preparation for the revolution concerned only the little group of revolutionists armed for the coup.

Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\" [[Benjamin Tucker]].

The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The Commune elections were held on 26 March. They elected a Commune council of 92 members, one member for each 20,000 residents.<ref>Rougerie, Jacques, ''La Commune de Paris''. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France. {{ISBN|978-2-13-062078-5}}.</ref> Despite internal differences, the council began to organise public services. It reached a consensus on certain policies that tended towards a progressive, secular and highly democratic [[social democracy]].\n\nBecause the Commune was able to meet on fewer than 60 days in total, only a few decrees were actually implemented. These included the [[separation of church and state]]; the remission of rents owed for the period of the siege (during which payment had been suspended); the abolition of [[Shift work|night work]] in the hundreds of Paris [[bakeries]]; the granting of pensions to the unmarried companions and children of National Guards killed on active service; and the free return of all workmen's tools and household items valued up to 20 francs that had been pledged during the siege.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre, La Commune\">Milza, Pierre, ''La Commune''.</ref> The Commune was concerned that skilled workers had been forced to pawn their tools during the war; the postponement of commercial [[debt]] obligations and the abolition of interest on the debts; and the [[workers' self-management|right of employees to take over and run an enterprise]] if it were deserted by its owner.

In 1865 and 1866, it held a preliminary conference and had its first congress in [[Geneva]], respectively. Due to their wide variety of philosophies, conflict immediately erupted. The first objections to Marx came from the mutualists who opposed [[state socialism]]. Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into camps headed by Marx and Bakunin.<ref>\"It is unnecessary to repeat the accounts of the Geneva and Hague Congresses of the International in which the issues between Marx and Bakunin were fought out and the organisation itself split apart into the dying Marxist rump centered around the New York General Council and the anti-authoritarian majority centred around the Bakuninist Jura Federation.

Like Proudhonists, they asserted the right of each individual to the product of his labour and to be remunerated for his particular contribution to production. By contrast, [[anarcho-communists]] sought collective ownership of both the means and the products of labour.

Revolutionary socialists quickly targeted reformism: [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Social Reform or Revolution]]?'' [[Revolutionary socialism]] encompasses multiple social and political movements that may define \"revolution\" differently. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections, it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels.

He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain [[class consciousness]] so long as they were too busy working to pay their expenses. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_leninscritique.html |title=Commanding Heights: Lenin's Critique of Global Capitalism |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nUpon arriving in [[Petrograd]], Lenin declared that the revolution in Russia had only begun, and that the next step was for the workers' [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s to take full authority. He issued a [[April Thesis|thesis]] outlining the Bolshevik programme, including rejection of any legitimacy in the provisional government and advocacy for state power to be administered through the soviets.

Major reforms in the Nordic countries are the results of consensus and compromise across the political spectrum. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, key reforms were implemented under social democratic cabinets while in Finland and Iceland centre-right parties dominated during the implementation of the model. Since World War II, Nordic countries have largely maintained a [[Mixed economy#European social democracy|mixed-market economy]].

In 1989 at Stockholm, the 18th Congress of the Socialist International adopted a new Declaration of Principles, saying: <blockquote>Democratic socialism is an international movement for freedom, social justice, and solidarity.

It believes that, by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create, for each of us, the means to realise our true potential, and, for all of us, a community in which power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |title=Labour Party Clause Four |publisher=Labour.org.uk |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081023/http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |archivedate=11 July 2007 |df=}}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary socialist politics ==\n[[File:1989 CPA 6101.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first [[president of Ghana]] and theorist of [[African socialism]], on a [[Soviet Union]] commemorative postage stamp]]\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{main|African socialism}}\nAfrican socialism has been and continues to be a major ideology around the continent.

[[Fela Kuti]] was inspired by socialism and called for a democratic African republic. In South Africa the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) abandoned its partial socialist allegiances after taking power and followed a standard neoliberal route. From 2005 through to 2007, the country was wracked by many thousands of protests from poor communities.

For Marx and Engels, conditions determine consciousness and ending the role of the capitalist class leads eventually to a [[classless society]] in which the [[withering away of the state|state would wither away]].

In contrast to Karl Marx's perspective of the state, Lassalle rejected the concept of the state as a class-based power structure whose main function was to preserve existing class structures. Thus Lassalle also rejected the Marxist view that the state was destined to \"wither away\".

They have been categorised as [[Religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some. Likewise, modern [[intentional communities]] based on socialist ideas could also be categorised as \"utopian socialist\".\n\nFor Marxists, the development of capitalism in Western Europe provided a material basis for the possibility of bringing about socialism because according to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' \"[w]hat the bourgeoisie produces above all is its own grave diggers\",<ref>Marx and Engels, Communist Manifesto</ref> namely the working class, which must become conscious of the historical objectives set it by society.\n\n=== Reform versus revolution ===\n{{main|Reformism|Revolutionary socialism}}\nRevolutionary socialists believe that a social revolution is necessary to effect structural changes to the socioeconomic structure of society. Among revolutionary socialists there are differences in strategy, theory and the definition of \"revolution\". Orthodox Marxists and left communists take an [[Impossibilism|impossibilist]] stance, believing that revolution should be spontaneous as a result of contradictions in society due to technological changes in the productive forces. Lenin theorised that under capitalism the workers cannot achieve class consciousness beyond organising into [[Trade union|unions]] and making demands of the capitalists. Therefore, [[Leninism|Leninists]] advocate that it is historically necessary for a [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] of class conscious revolutionaries to take a central role in coordinating the social revolution to overthrow the capitalist state and eventually the institution of the state altogether.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Leninist Concept of the Revolutionary Vanguard Party |url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/socialistvoice/partyPR46.html |website=WRG |accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref> \"Revolution\" is not necessarily defined by revolutionary socialists as violent insurrection,<ref>Schaff, Adam, 'Marxist Theory on Revolution and Violence', p. 263. in Journal of the history of ideas, Vol 34, no. 2 (April\u2013June 1973)</ref> but as a complete dismantling and rapid transformation of all areas of class society led by the majority of the masses: the working class.\n\nReformism is generally associated with [[social democracy]] and [[gradualist]] democratic socialism.

There are two major types of planning: decentralised-planning and centralised-planning. [[Enrico Barone]] provided a comprehensive theoretical framework for a planned socialist economy. In his model, assuming perfect computation techniques, simultaneous equations relating inputs and outputs to ratios of equivalence would provide appropriate valuations in order to balance supply and demand.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gregory and Stuart |first=Paul and Robert |title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition |publisher=George Hoffman |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-618-26181-9 |pages=120\u201321}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent example of a planned economy was the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic system of the Soviet Union]] and as such the centralised-planned economic model is usually associated with the [[communist state]]s of the 20th century, where it was combined with a single-party political system. In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency (see also the [[analysis of Soviet-type economic planning]]). The economic systems of the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] are further classified as \"command economies\", which are defined as systems where economic coordination is undertaken by commands, directives and production targets.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ericson |first=Richard E. |title=Command Economy |url=http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf |website= |access-date=9 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125010605/http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf |archive-date=25 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Studies by economists of various political persuasions on the actual functioning of the Soviet economy indicate that it was not actually a planned economy. Instead of conscious planning, the Soviet economy was based on a process whereby the plan was modified by localised agents and the original plans went largely unfulfilled. Planning agencies, ministries and enterprises all adapted and bargained with each other during the formulation of the plan as opposed to following a plan passed down from a higher authority, leading some economists to suggest that planning did not actually take place within the Soviet economy and that a better description would be an \"administered\" or \"managed\" economy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nove |first=Alec |title=The Economics of Feasible Socialism, Revisited |publisher=Routledge |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-04-335049-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsoffeasi00nove/page/78 78] |quote=Several authors of the most diverse political views have stated that there is in fact no planning in the Soviet Union: Eugene Zaleski, J.

Leon Trotsky rejected central planning in favour of decentralised planning. He argued that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, would be unable to coordinate effectively all economic activity within an economy because they operated without the input and tacit knowledge embodied by the participation of the millions of people in the economy. As a result, central planners would be unable to respond to local economic conditions.<ref>''Writings 1932\u201333, p. 96'', Leon Trotsky.</ref> [[State socialism]] is unfeasible in this view because information cannot be aggregated by a central body and effectively used to formulate a plan for an entire economy, because doing so would result in [[Economic calculation problem|distorted or absent price signals]].<ref name=\"hayek\">F.

These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\" [[Benjamin Tucker]].

Some democratic socialists support [[social democracy]] as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane, while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is either completely forgotten or redefined in a pro-capitalist way. The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences.\n\nThe major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics: contemporary social democrats support a [[welfare state]] and unemployment insurance as a means to \"humanise\" capitalism, whereas democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to \"humanise\" capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice |year=2006 |url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labour movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanised, and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere. (E.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labour discipline breaks down; etc.)\"</ref>\n\nDemocratic socialism generally refers to any political movement that seeks to establish an economy based on [[economic democracy]] by and for the working class. Democratic socialism is difficult to define and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral, [[Reformism|reformist]] or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one.<ref>This definition is captured in this statement by [[Anthony Crosland]], who \"argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the [[Marxist]]s, but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant\". {{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Pierson |title=Lost property: What the Third Way lacks |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=145\u201363 |doi=10.1080/13569310500097265}} Other texts which use the terms \"democratic socialism\" in this way include Malcolm Hamilton ''Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden'' (St Martin's Press 1989).</ref>\n\n{{quotation|You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums.

The people were expected to play their part only at the moment of revolution. Preparation for the revolution concerned only the little group of revolutionists armed for the coup.

He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused and that \"affirming one's difference\" can actually enhance social integration.<ref>[[Charles Fourier]], ''Le Nouveau Monde amoureux'' (written 1816\u201318, not published widely until 1967: Paris: \u00c9ditions Anthropos). pp. 389, 391, 429, 458, 459, 462, and 463.</ref> In [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man Under Socialism]]'', he passionately advocates for an [[egalitarian]] society where wealth is shared by all, while warning of the dangers of social systems that crush individuality. Wilde's [[libertarian socialist]] politics were shared by other figures who actively campaigned for homosexual emancipation in the late 19th century such as [[Edward Carpenter]].<ref>According to his biographer Neil McKenna, Wilde was part of a secret organisation that aimed to legalise homosexuality, and was known among the group as a leader of \"the Cause\".

An important early influence was the thought of the American [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''<ref name=\"Thoreau\">\"Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html \"La Insumisi\u00f3n voluntaria.
