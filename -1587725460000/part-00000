Elves generally used straight swords while Orcs generally used curved swords. Both races have exceptions: Egalmoth of [[Gondolin]] used a curved sword and the [[Uruk-hai]] of [[Isengard]] used short, broad blades. Tolkien often mentions the use of shields together with (one-handed) swords.<ref name=\"piela\"/>\n\nIn ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy most Elvish swords are curved but some named swords are interpreted as two-handed [[longsword]]s. The films also embellished upon Tolkien's descriptions of swords (and other weapons) by making up inscriptions for these items.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\n===Knives===\nKnives are mentioned in Tolkien's works, sometimes as backup weapons\u2014such as the nondescript long knife of [[Legolas]] the archer.<ref name=\"piela\"/> However, some individual knives are given more significance through naming (e.g. [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], see below).<ref name=\"burdge\"/> Weapons that were only knives or short swords for adult [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] or [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] could function as formidable swords in the hands of [[Hobbits]], a diminutive people.\n\nIn \"[[The Scouring of the Shire]]\", [[Saruman]] attempts to stab Frodo with a knife, but is foiled by [[Mithril#The mithril-coat|the mithril shirt]] Frodo wore under his jacket. Shortly afterwards Saruman's throat was fatally cut with a knife born by [[Wormtongue]].\n\nFor ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, some characters such as [[Aragorn]] was gifted with an Elven hunting knife which he retained well towards the Battle of the Black Gate. [[Boromir]]'s costume design included [[throwing knives]], and Legolas now possessed twin fighting knives carried in sheaths near his quiver.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\n====Special unnamed knives====\nThere are some knives in Tolkien's fiction which do not have proper formal names, but nevertheless play important roles in the plot.\n\n=====Morgul-blades=====\n{{anchor|Morgul-blade}}\nThe [[Witch-king of Angmar]], leader of the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], used a magical [[dagger]] called a \"[[Minas Morgul|Morgul]]-blade\" to wound [[Frodo Baggins]] at [[Weathertop]]. The dark magic of the knife gravely affects Frodo's well-being, threatening to turn him into a wraith, especially because its detachable point migrated in Frodo's body for more than two weeks before it could be extracted, thus causing great damage. Recurring ill effects from the wound contribute to Frodo's eventual departure to [[Valinor]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', p. 208, 210; ''[[The Return of the King]]'', p. 333</ref> The weapon may owe something to the Old English tradition of the \"[[elf-shot]]\". The term appears in Old English medical texts and charms and refers to illnesses of presumed supernatural origin.<ref name=\"morgul\">{{cite book|title=[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]]|editor1-first=Michael|editor1-last=Drout|editor1-link=Michael Drout|chapter=Elf-shot|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-96942-0}}</ref>\n\n=====Barrow-blades=====\nFour magical daggers, which had been forged by the Men of [[N\u00famenor|Westernesse]] to fight the powers of [[Mordor]], are recovered from a tomb in the [[Barrow-downs]] by [[Tom Bombadil]]. He gives them to [[Frodo Baggins]] and his Hobbit companions, for whom the daggers are effectively swords. One of these \"Barrow-blades\" \u2013 that given to [[Merry Brandybuck]] \u2013 proves instrumental in bringing about the death of the [[Witch-king]].<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"The [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]\", p. 117: \"No other blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter, cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will.\"</ref>\n\nThe three other daggers had varying fates in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. When the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] attacked [[Aragorn]] and the hobbits on [[Weathertop]], Frodo slashed at one of them with his dagger but only damaged its cloak. He broke the blade when he fell from a horse, and left it behind in Rivendell, taking Bilbo's sword Sting instead. [[Sam Gamgee]] left his beside Frodo in [[Cirith Ungol]] and later had it returned to him by [[Gandalf]]. [[Pippin Took]] made use of his dagger in the [[Battle of the Black Gate]] to slay a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Troll]]-chief.\n\n===Axes===\n[[Battle axe]]s are especially favoured by [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] in Tolkien's writings;<ref name=\"piela\"/> they famously used the [[battle cry]]: ''Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!'' ([[Khuzdul]]: ''Baruk Khaz\u00e2d! Khaz\u00e2d ai-m\u00eanu!'').<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"The Battle of Helm's Deep\"</ref> For ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] the Dwarf was assigned various axes of different makes during the course of the films.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nThe use of battle axes in other races tended to be more exceptional. The Sindarin Elves of [[Doriath]] favoured axes as weapons during the [[First Age]]. Other notable axe-bearers were [[Tuor]] (the wielder of [[#Dramboleg|Dramborleg]]), the [[White Mountains (Middle-earth)#Peoples and history|Men of the White Mountains]] who marched to the defence of [[Minas Tirith]] in ''The Lord of the Rings'', and a contingent of [[Easterlings#\"Easterlings with axes\"|Easterlings]] among the besiegers of Minas Tirith.\n\n===Bows and arrows===\n[[Bow and arrow|Bow]]s of different sizes and construction are featured in Tolkien's works. [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], and [[Uruk-hai]] used [[longbow]]s, while Elves of [[Mirkwood]] and [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] of [[Mordor]] used smaller ones. These bows are said to be made of wood, horn and even steel.<ref name=\"piela\"/>\n\nThe most famous bowman in Tolkien's stories of the [[First Age]] of Middle-earth is the Elf [[Beleg]]; his bow was named [[#Belthronding|Belthronding]], and his arrow [[#Dailir|Dailir]]. Infamously Curufin, a lord of the [[Noldor]], attempts to shoot the Elf-princess [[L\u00fathien]] with the bow of his brother [[Celegorm]]. His first arrow is intercepted by [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]; [[Beren]] attempts to intercept the second shot, and is wounded.<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'' ch. 19 \"Of Beren and Luthien\" p.177; {{ISBN|0 04 823139 8}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in the late [[Third Age]], a bow is the main weapon of [[Legolas]], the Elf-member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]]. When the Fellowship meet [[Galadriel]], she gives Legolas a new bow. He later uses it to shoot all the way across the great river [[Anduin]] and bring down an airborne [[Nazg\u00fbl]].\n\n[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The films of ''The Lord of the Rings'']] assign a bow to [[Aragorn]] and [[crossbow]]s to the Uruk-hai. However, in Tolkien's writings Aragorn is armed only with the sword [[And\u00faril]] (below), and crossbows are nowhere mentioned.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nSometimes individual [[arrow]]s are given special mention in Tolkien's works. In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the ''[[#Black Arrow|Black Arrow]]'' was a royal heirloom used by [[Bard the Bowman]] to kill the dragon [[Smaug]].<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]''</ref> In ''The Lord of the Rings'', the [[Red Arrow (Middle-earth)|''Red Arrow'']] was a token used by [[Gondor]] to summon its allies in time of need.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', p. 72; ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', p. 364, 411</ref> In the '' Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, the Red Arrow is omitted and its role is conflated with the [[Beacons of Gondor]].<ref name=\"timmons\">{{cite book|title=[[J.R.R.

As with other items of war, Elves and Dwarves produced the best armour. [[Mithril#The mithril-coat|The mail shirt]] forged by Dwarves from the fictional metal ''[[mithril]]'' appears in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', worn in turn by the protagonists [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and Frodo Baggins.<ref name=\"piela\"/><ref name=\"mithril\" group=T>{{cite book|title=[[J.R.R.

The [[Rohirrim]] were partly modeled on the [[Anglo-Saxons]], who wore [[Weaponry in Anglo-Saxon England|elaborate helmets]]; [[\u00c9omer]]'s helmet had a long white horse-tail. The Crown of Gondor was a jewelled battle-helmet; [[Aragorn]] received it at his coronation. [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Sam Gamgee]] use [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]]-helmets as part of their disguise in [[Mordor]].\n\nIn the [[First Age]], [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] made dragon-helms, which were said to protect against [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]]. The most famous of these was the [[#Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min|Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min]].\n\nThe [[Second Age]] was dominated by [[N\u00famenor]]. The N\u00famen\u00f3rean helmet, the '''''karma''''', reached particularly elaborate forms. Those of the [[N\u00famenor#Uinendili|Uinendili]], a guild of mariners, were \"made of overlapping plates of metal, the 'fish-crest' of leather embossed and coloured\".<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', inside rear dust-jacket</ref> Tolkien's coloured drawing of the ''karma'' of a Uinendili captain features on the cover of ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.\n\n==Named items==\nTolkien emulated his Northern European mythological and literary sources in creating weapons and armour with names (real examples of named weapons include [[Hrunting]] and [[N\u00e6gling]] in ''Beowulf'', [[Tyrfing]] in the ''[[Elder Edda]]'' and [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]] in the ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]''). The items illustrate the passage of time and the transfer of power or fate to their future bearers.<ref name=\"burdge\"/>\n\n===Named swords and knives===\n====Anglachel====\n\nAnglachel ([[Sindarin]]: ''Iron of the Flaming Star'') was a sword forged of [[meteoritic iron]] by E\u00f6l the Dark [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]], given to [[Thingol]] King of [[Doriath]] as a fee for leave to dwell in Nan Elmoth. It could cleave all earth-delved iron. Later wielded by [[Beleg]] Strongbow and ultimately [[T\u00farin]];<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 201-202, 206-210, 316; ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', p. 148, 419</ref><ref>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 226</ref><ref group=T>''The Silmarillion'', p. 225.</ref> Anglachel was reforged and renamed '''Gurthang''' ([[Sindarin]]: ''Iron of Death''<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. p. 443</ref>). T\u00farin used Gurthang to kill Glaurung, the Father of [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]], and later used the sword to take his own life in recompense for the accidental slaying of Beleg and the unjust slaying of Brandir. The stories endow the sword with a personality; Melian the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]] perceived malice in it as it was given to Beleg C\u00fathalion, and the elf Gwindor observed that Anglachel (so named then) seemed to mourn the death of Beleg at the hand of his friend T\u00farin by Anglachel itself. T\u00farin asked the sword whether it would slay him swiftly if he cast himself on its point, and it responded at length (the only instance of Gurthang speaking with voice). The depiction of the sword was influenced by that of the sword of the Finnish character [[Kullervo]] in the ''[[Kalevala]]''.<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref name=\"petty\">{{cite book |title=[[J.R.R.

[[Beren]], who had taken it from Curufin, used it to cut a magical [[Silmaril]] jewel out of [[Morgoth]]'s Iron Crown; as Beren attempted to remove another, the knife snapped.<ref name=\"burdge\" /><ref>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', pp. 177, 181</ref> In the earliest version of Beren's story in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', he uses an ordinary household knife; the element of Curufin's involvement in Beren's affairs came later.<ref group=T>{{ME-ref|BOLT2|\"The Tale of Tin\u00faviel}}</ref>\n\n====Anguirel====\n\nAnguirel ([[Sindarin]]: ''Iron of Eternity'') is the sword forged by E\u00f6l the Dark Elf, similar to Anglachel which was given to [[Thingol]] of Doriath in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. It was the mate of Anglachel, was made of the same meteoritic iron, and had the same physical properties and capabilities as Anglachel, but there is no evidence of sentience in Anguirel. Anguirel was kept by E\u00f6l until it was stolen by his son, Maeglin.<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 202</ref>\n\n====Aranr\u00fath====\n\nAranr\u00fath ([[Sindarin]]: ''King's Ire''<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]''. p. 317</ref>) is the sword wielded by King [[Thingol]] of Doriath in ''The Silmarillion''.<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 201, 279; ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', p. 171</ref> Later the sword of the Kings of N\u00famenor.\n\n====Glamdring====\n\n[[File:Glamdring-no-bg.png|thumb|75 px|An example of the sword Glamdring forged after the description in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\nGlamdring ([[Sindarin]]: '''Foe-hammer'''<ref name=\"The Hobbit. p. 62\" group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]''. \"A Short Rest\", p. 62</ref>) is a sword in ''The Hobbit'', ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''Unfinished Tales''<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', p. 53; ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', p. 293, 324; ''[[The Two Towers]]'', p. 115; ''[[The Return of the King]]'', p. 272; ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', p. 54</ref> forged in the [[First Age]] by the [[Noldor|High Elves]] of the hidden city of [[Gondolin]].

It was the mate of [[#Orcrist|Orcrist]], and like Orcrist would glow blue whenever orcs were nearby.

By the end of the [[Second Age]] Narsil was borne by [[Elendil]]; it was broken in the struggle of Elendil and [[Gil-galad]] against [[Sauron]]. [[Isildur]] used the hilt-shard to cut the [[One Ring]] from Sauron's hand. The shards, acquiring the additional name '''the Sword that was Broken''', remained an heirloom of Isildur's heirs throughout the [[Third Age]], and were thus inherited by [[Aragorn]]. In T. A. 3018 the sword was reforged as '''And\u00faril''' (Quenya: ''Flame of the West''<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', p. 437</ref>).\n\nIn the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|motion picture series]] directed by [[Peter Jackson]], Narsil was broken into six parts (rather than two), which were kept in [[Rivendell]], and broke not when [[Elendil]] fell but rather when Isildur reached for it and Sauron stomped on it. It is also not reforged into And\u00faril until the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|third film]], when [[Arwen]] persuades [[Elrond]] to have [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elven]] smiths reforge it from the shards of Narsil and bring it to Aragorn. In the book<!--LOTR is one book in three published parts-->, he actually wears the broken blade and shows it to the [[Hobbit]]s when they meet at the ''[[Prancing Pony]]'' in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], and its reforging prior to the departure of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] is a decisive move toward kingship.\n\nThe incident involving Aragorn disarming reluctantly before entering King [[Th\u00e9oden]]'s palace [[Meduseld]] is omitted from the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|second film]] on the grounds that the sword he surrenders there is not And\u00faril. However, the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|first film]] does include an invented scene of Aragorn reverently placing the hilt of Narsil back into the display after [[Boromir]] knocks it from its podium onto the floor.\n\nIn the ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship of the Ring]]''<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book II, Chapter III, \"The RIng Goes South\"</ref> And\u00faril is described as a [[Longsword|long sword]], and Boromir's sword is like And\u00faril but of less lineage. And in the [[The Return of the King|Return of the King]] And\u00faril is described as a great sword (a longsword) when seen on Aragorn's lap by Frodo at the Field of Cormallen,<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Book VI, Chapter IV, \"The Field of Cormallen\"</ref> In ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Aragorn obtains a shield from [[Th\u00e9oden]]'s armoury during the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. However it is never explicitly stated (nor is it impossible to use a long sword with a shield) that he uses the shield he received, and it is never referenced again (but the mail he received is), and it is quite likely that he intended to use the shield in his off-hand while mounted since a sword long or short can only be used in one-hand while mounted, but a shield may still be used in the off-hand while holding the reins of a horse, and as the host of Th\u00e9oden rode out from Edoras with the intention of engaging the hordes of Isengard in open battle the lack of a shield being mentioned could be explained by the changed course to Helm's Deep, this would explain why no reference to the shield is made, while many other shields most notably Th\u00e9oden's Golden shield are mentioned. The idea that technology in Middle-Earth is the same as [[Dark Age]] Europe is often misinterpreted from an incomplete understanding of letter 211 in which Tolkien compared the clothing of the Rohirrim and only the Rohirrim to the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], but he viewed the knights and general technology of his story to be Arthurian (e.g. long swords, chain mail, great shields, spears, longbows, [[vambrace]]s, greaves).<ref name=\"Tolkien Bayeux\" group=T>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', p. 295 \"The Rohirrim were not 'mediaeval', in our sense. The styles of the Bayeux Tapestry (made in England) fit them well enough, if one remembers that the kind of tennis-nets [the] soldiers seem to have on are only a clumsy conventional sign for chainmail of small rings\"</ref> Technology works backwards in Middle-Earth with the First Age being the time of the most skilled and incredible creations in crafting, and the later Ages being periods of decline eventually leading to the Last Battle and the breaking of the World eventually leading to our world, and would suggest that And\u00faril was depicted correctly as a long sword in the ''Lord of the Rings'' motion picture series. \n\nThe filmmakers opted not to make And\u00faril glow at all, keeping that property only for [[#Sting|Sting]]. ([[Gandalf]]'s sword [[#Glamdring|Glamdring]] also did not glow in the presence of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]]. Peter Jackson notes, in his DVD commentary on ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', that this was an oversight, not a deliberate change from the books.) The filmmakers had Anduril made with runes engraved on the blade of the sword that read as \"''Anar N\u00e1ny\u00eb And\u00faril i n\u00e9 Narsil i macil Elendilo. Lercuvanten i m\u00f3li Mord\u00f3r\u00ebo. Isil''\" (Quenya. 'Sun. I am And\u00faril who once was Narsil, sword of Elendil. The slaves of Mordor shall flee from me. Moon.'), and another inscription on the hilt ''Narsil essenya, macil meletya; Telchar carn\u00e9ron N\u00e1varotesse'' (Quenya. Narsil is my name, a mighty sword; Telchar made me in Nogrod)\n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] suggested that Narsil was introduced during the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' rather spontaneously: \"It is possible that the Sword that was Broken actually emerged from the verse '[[All that is Gold Does Not Glitter|All that is gold does not glitter]]': on this view, in the earliest form of the verse ... the words ''a king may yet be without crown, A blade that was broken be brandished'' were no more than a further exemplification of the general moral [that not everything is what it appears to be].\"<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', p. 137</ref> Following this, references to the Sword were introduced during major recastings of \"At the Sign of the [[Prancing Pony]]\" and \"The [[Council of Elrond]]\" chapters.<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', pp. 77-80, 120.</ref>\n\nOriginally the sword was only referred to as \"the Sword of Elendil\" or \"the Broken Sword\"; later the name '''''Branding''''' (from [[Old English]] ''brand'' 'sword') was devised for the Sword Reforged.<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', p. 290</ref> This was replaced by ''And\u00faril'' after the emergence of ''Narsil''.\n\n====Orcrist====\nOrcrist ([[Sindarin]]: '''[[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblin]]-cleaver'''<ref name=\"The Hobbit. p. 62\" group=T/>), a sword in ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', p. 53, 303</ref> was originally forged in [[Gondolin]] and was nicknamed \"'''Biter'''\" by the goblins of the [[Misty Mountains]]. After finding it in a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll]]-hoard, [[Thorin Oakenshield]] carried the sword through the Misty Mountains and [[Mirkwood]] before being taken prisoner by the [[Silvan Elves#Mirkwood|Elves]], and it was laid on his tomb after he died in the Battle of Five Armies. It is the mate of [[#Glamdring|Glamdring]].\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' films]], the sword is found and wielded by Thorin Oakenshield but ends up in the possession of [[Legolas]], who uses it in battle with the Orc Bolg but later returns it to Thorin so that the Dwarf may wield it against Azog the Defiler. Like [[#And\u00faril|And\u00faril]] and Glamdring in the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'' films]], it was not shown to glow in the presence of orcs due to the film-makers fearing that doing that made it resemble a [[lightsaber]]. Although described as the mate of Glamdring in the books, Orcrist in the films takes on a significantly different appearance akin to that of a [[Messer (weapon)|kriegsmesser]], being a two-handed, single-edged sword, with a deep, heavy belly and pronounced curve.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ringil====\n\nRingil ([[Sindarin]]: ''Cold-Star / Cold-Spark'') is a sword wielded by [[Fingolfin]] in ''The Silmarillion'' and ''The Lays of Beleriand''. It bit with chilling cold, and glittered like ice with a pale light.<ref name=\"burdge\"/> This was the sword with which Fingolfin wounded [[Morgoth]] seven times, causing the first dark lord to limp forever afterward.<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', pp. 153\u2013154, 347</ref><ref group=T>''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'', \"The Lay of Leithian\", Canto XII}}</ref>\n\nIn Tolkien's early writings, Ringil was the name of one of the two pillars supporting the Two Lamps of primeval Middle-earth.<ref group=T>''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' (Part I) pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n====Sting====\n{{Main|Sting (Middle-earth)|l1=Sting}}\n\nSting is a knife in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.

The arrow was lost with the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragon]]'s corpse in the [[Long Lake (Middle-earth)|Long Lake]].\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' films]], the Black Arrow's significance was elaborated on. Instead of being a regular-sized arrow, the Black Arrow was the size of a short spear, and was used as ammunition for a windlance (a [[Ballista|ballista-type weapon]]) in Dale. All but one were used to defend the city from Smaug during his invasion, but it only broke one of his scales, and Dale was subsequently destroyed. The final Black Arrow was kept by Bard's family as an heirloom. When Smaug attacks Lake Town, Bard attempts to shoot Smaug with a normal longbow, but his arrows inflict no harm to Smaug. After receiving the Black Arrow from his son Bain, Bard constructs an improvised ballista and fires the Black Arrow at Smaug's weak spot, which successfully hits its mark and kills Smaug.\n\n====Dailir====\nDailir is the arrow favoured by [[Beleg]], the great bowman of the [[First Age]] of Middle-earth.

Elves generally used straight swords while Orcs generally used curved swords. Both races have exceptions: Egalmoth of [[Gondolin]] used a curved sword and the [[Uruk-hai]] of [[Isengard]] used short, broad blades. Tolkien often mentions the use of shields together with (one-handed) swords.<ref name=\"piela\"/>\n\nIn ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy most Elvish swords are curved but some named swords are interpreted as two-handed [[longsword]]s.

Shortly afterwards Saruman's throat was fatally cut with a knife born by [[Wormtongue]].\n\nFor ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, some characters such as [[Aragorn]] was gifted with an Elven hunting knife which he retained well towards the Battle of the Black Gate. [[Boromir]]'s costume design included [[throwing knives]], and Legolas now possessed twin fighting knives carried in sheaths near his quiver.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\n====Special unnamed knives====\nThere are some knives in Tolkien's fiction which do not have proper formal names, but nevertheless play important roles in the plot.\n\n=====Morgul-blades=====\n{{anchor|Morgul-blade}}\nThe [[Witch-king of Angmar]], leader of the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], used a magical [[dagger]] called a \"[[Minas Morgul|Morgul]]-blade\" to wound [[Frodo Baggins]] at [[Weathertop]]. The dark magic of the knife gravely affects Frodo's well-being, threatening to turn him into a wraith, especially because its detachable point migrated in Frodo's body for more than two weeks before it could be extracted, thus causing great damage.

When the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] attacked [[Aragorn]] and the hobbits on [[Weathertop]], Frodo slashed at one of them with his dagger but only damaged its cloak. He broke the blade when he fell from a horse, and left it behind in Rivendell, taking Bilbo's sword Sting instead. [[Sam Gamgee]] left his beside Frodo in [[Cirith Ungol]] and later had it returned to him by [[Gandalf]]. [[Pippin Took]] made use of his dagger in the [[Battle of the Black Gate]] to slay a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Troll]]-chief.\n\n===Axes===\n[[Battle axe]]s are especially favoured by [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] in Tolkien's writings;<ref name=\"piela\"/> they famously used the [[battle cry]]: ''Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!'' ([[Khuzdul]]: ''Baruk Khaz\u00e2d! Khaz\u00e2d ai-m\u00eanu!'').<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"The Battle of Helm's Deep\"</ref> For ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] the Dwarf was assigned various axes of different makes during the course of the films.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nThe use of battle axes in other races tended to be more exceptional. The Sindarin Elves of [[Doriath]] favoured axes as weapons during the [[First Age]]. Other notable axe-bearers were [[Tuor]] (the wielder of [[#Dramboleg|Dramborleg]]), the [[White Mountains (Middle-earth)#Peoples and history|Men of the White Mountains]] who marched to the defence of [[Minas Tirith]] in ''The Lord of the Rings'', and a contingent of [[Easterlings#\"Easterlings with axes\"|Easterlings]] among the besiegers of Minas Tirith.\n\n===Bows and arrows===\n[[Bow and arrow|Bow]]s of different sizes and construction are featured in Tolkien's works. [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], and [[Uruk-hai]] used [[longbow]]s, while Elves of [[Mirkwood]] and [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] of [[Mordor]] used smaller ones. These bows are said to be made of wood, horn and even steel.<ref name=\"piela\"/>\n\nThe most famous bowman in Tolkien's stories of the [[First Age]] of Middle-earth is the Elf [[Beleg]]; his bow was named [[#Belthronding|Belthronding]], and his arrow [[#Dailir|Dailir]]. Infamously Curufin, a lord of the [[Noldor]], attempts to shoot the Elf-princess [[L\u00fathien]] with the bow of his brother [[Celegorm]]. His first arrow is intercepted by [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]; [[Beren]] attempts to intercept the second shot, and is wounded.<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'' ch. 19 \"Of Beren and Luthien\" p.177; {{ISBN|0 04 823139 8}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in the late [[Third Age]], a bow is the main weapon of [[Legolas]], the Elf-member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]]. When the Fellowship meet [[Galadriel]], she gives Legolas a new bow. He later uses it to shoot all the way across the great river [[Anduin]] and bring down an airborne [[Nazg\u00fbl]].\n\n[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The films of ''The Lord of the Rings'']] assign a bow to [[Aragorn]] and [[crossbow]]s to the Uruk-hai. However, in Tolkien's writings Aragorn is armed only with the sword [[And\u00faril]] (below), and crossbows are nowhere mentioned.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nSometimes individual [[arrow]]s are given special mention in Tolkien's works. In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the ''[[#Black Arrow|Black Arrow]]'' was a royal heirloom used by [[Bard the Bowman]] to kill the dragon [[Smaug]].<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]''</ref> In ''The Lord of the Rings'', the [[Red Arrow (Middle-earth)|''Red Arrow'']] was a token used by [[Gondor]] to summon its allies in time of need.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', p. 72; ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', p. 364, 411</ref> In the '' Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, the Red Arrow is omitted and its role is conflated with the [[Beacons of Gondor]].<ref name=\"timmons\">{{cite book|title=[[J.R.R.

As with other items of war, Elves and Dwarves produced the best armour. [[Mithril#The mithril-coat|The mail shirt]] forged by Dwarves from the fictional metal ''[[mithril]]'' appears in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', worn in turn by the protagonists [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and Frodo Baggins.<ref name=\"piela\"/><ref name=\"mithril\" group=T>{{cite book|title=[[J.R.R.

The [[Rohirrim]] were partly modeled on the [[Anglo-Saxons]], who wore [[Weaponry in Anglo-Saxon England|elaborate helmets]]; [[\u00c9omer]]'s helmet had a long white horse-tail. The Crown of Gondor was a jewelled battle-helmet; [[Aragorn]] received it at his coronation. [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Sam Gamgee]] use [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]]-helmets as part of their disguise in [[Mordor]].\n\nIn the [[First Age]], [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] made dragon-helms, which were said to protect against [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]]. The most famous of these was the [[#Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min|Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min]].\n\nThe [[Second Age]] was dominated by [[N\u00famenor]]. The N\u00famen\u00f3rean helmet, the '''''karma''''', reached particularly elaborate forms. Those of the [[N\u00famenor#Uinendili|Uinendili]], a guild of mariners, were \"made of overlapping plates of metal, the 'fish-crest' of leather embossed and coloured\".<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', inside rear dust-jacket</ref> Tolkien's coloured drawing of the ''karma'' of a Uinendili captain features on the cover of ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.\n\n==Named items==\nTolkien emulated his Northern European mythological and literary sources in creating weapons and armour with names (real examples of named weapons include [[Hrunting]] and [[N\u00e6gling]] in ''Beowulf'', [[Tyrfing]] in the ''[[Elder Edda]]'' and [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]] in the ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]''). The items illustrate the passage of time and the transfer of power or fate to their future bearers.<ref name=\"burdge\"/>\n\n===Named swords and knives===\n====Anglachel====\n\nAnglachel ([[Sindarin]]: ''Iron of the Flaming Star'') was a sword forged of [[meteoritic iron]] by E\u00f6l the Dark [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]], given to [[Thingol]] King of [[Doriath]] as a fee for leave to dwell in Nan Elmoth. It could cleave all earth-delved iron. Later wielded by [[Beleg]] Strongbow and ultimately [[T\u00farin]];<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 201-202, 206-210, 316; ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', p. 148, 419</ref><ref>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 226</ref><ref group=T>''The Silmarillion'', p. 225.</ref> Anglachel was reforged and renamed '''Gurthang''' ([[Sindarin]]: ''Iron of Death''<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. p. 443</ref>). T\u00farin used Gurthang to kill Glaurung, the Father of [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]], and later used the sword to take his own life in recompense for the accidental slaying of Beleg and the unjust slaying of Brandir. The stories endow the sword with a personality; Melian the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]] perceived malice in it as it was given to Beleg C\u00fathalion, and the elf Gwindor observed that Anglachel (so named then) seemed to mourn the death of Beleg at the hand of his friend T\u00farin by Anglachel itself. T\u00farin asked the sword whether it would slay him swiftly if he cast himself on its point, and it responded at length (the only instance of Gurthang speaking with voice). The depiction of the sword was influenced by that of the sword of the Finnish character [[Kullervo]] in the ''[[Kalevala]]''.<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref name=\"petty\">{{cite book |title=[[J.R.R.

It was the mate of Anglachel, was made of the same meteoritic iron, and had the same physical properties and capabilities as Anglachel, but there is no evidence of sentience in Anguirel.

It was the mate of [[#Orcrist|Orcrist]], and like Orcrist would glow blue whenever orcs were nearby.

By the end of the [[Second Age]] Narsil was borne by [[Elendil]]; it was broken in the struggle of Elendil and [[Gil-galad]] against [[Sauron]]. [[Isildur]] used the hilt-shard to cut the [[One Ring]] from Sauron's hand. The shards, acquiring the additional name '''the Sword that was Broken''', remained an heirloom of Isildur's heirs throughout the [[Third Age]], and were thus inherited by [[Aragorn]]. In T. A. 3018 the sword was reforged as '''And\u00faril''' (Quenya: ''Flame of the West''<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', p. 437</ref>).\n\nIn the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|motion picture series]] directed by [[Peter Jackson]], Narsil was broken into six parts (rather than two), which were kept in [[Rivendell]], and broke not when [[Elendil]] fell but rather when Isildur reached for it and Sauron stomped on it. It is also not reforged into And\u00faril until the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|third film]], when [[Arwen]] persuades [[Elrond]] to have [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elven]] smiths reforge it from the shards of Narsil and bring it to Aragorn. In the book<!--LOTR is one book in three published parts-->, he actually wears the broken blade and shows it to the [[Hobbit]]s when they meet at the ''[[Prancing Pony]]'' in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], and its reforging prior to the departure of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] is a decisive move toward kingship.\n\nThe incident involving Aragorn disarming reluctantly before entering King [[Th\u00e9oden]]'s palace [[Meduseld]] is omitted from the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|second film]] on the grounds that the sword he surrenders there is not And\u00faril. However, the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|first film]] does include an invented scene of Aragorn reverently placing the hilt of Narsil back into the display after [[Boromir]] knocks it from its podium onto the floor.\n\nIn the ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship of the Ring]]''<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book II, Chapter III, \"The RIng Goes South\"</ref> And\u00faril is described as a [[Longsword|long sword]], and Boromir's sword is like And\u00faril but of less lineage. And in the [[The Return of the King|Return of the King]] And\u00faril is described as a great sword (a longsword) when seen on Aragorn's lap by Frodo at the Field of Cormallen,<ref group=T>''[[The Return of The King]]'', Book VI, Chapter IV, \"The Field of Cormallen\"</ref> In ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Aragorn obtains a shield from [[Th\u00e9oden]]'s armoury during the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. However it is never explicitly stated (nor is it impossible to use a long sword with a shield) that he uses the shield he received, and it is never referenced again (but the mail he received is), and it is quite likely that he intended to use the shield in his off-hand while mounted since a sword long or short can only be used in one-hand while mounted, but a shield may still be used in the off-hand while holding the reins of a horse, and as the host of Th\u00e9oden rode out from Edoras with the intention of engaging the hordes of Isengard in open battle the lack of a shield being mentioned could be explained by the changed course to Helm's Deep, this would explain why no reference to the shield is made, while many other shields most notably Th\u00e9oden's Golden shield are mentioned. The idea that technology in Middle-Earth is the same as [[Dark Age]] Europe is often misinterpreted from an incomplete understanding of letter 211 in which Tolkien compared the clothing of the Rohirrim and only the Rohirrim to the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], but he viewed the knights and general technology of his story to be Arthurian (e.g. long swords, chain mail, great shields, spears, longbows, [[vambrace]]s, greaves).<ref name=\"Tolkien Bayeux\" group=T>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', p. 295 \"The Rohirrim were not 'mediaeval', in our sense. The styles of the Bayeux Tapestry (made in England) fit them well enough, if one remembers that the kind of tennis-nets [the] soldiers seem to have on are only a clumsy conventional sign for chainmail of small rings\"</ref> Technology works backwards in Middle-Earth with the First Age being the time of the most skilled and incredible creations in crafting, and the later Ages being periods of decline eventually leading to the Last Battle and the breaking of the World eventually leading to our world, and would suggest that And\u00faril was depicted correctly as a long sword in the ''Lord of the Rings'' motion picture series. \n\nThe filmmakers opted not to make And\u00faril glow at all, keeping that property only for [[#Sting|Sting]]. ([[Gandalf]]'s sword [[#Glamdring|Glamdring]] also did not glow in the presence of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]]. Peter Jackson notes, in his DVD commentary on ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', that this was an oversight, not a deliberate change from the books.) The filmmakers had Anduril made with runes engraved on the blade of the sword that read as \"''Anar N\u00e1ny\u00eb And\u00faril i n\u00e9 Narsil i macil Elendilo. Lercuvanten i m\u00f3li Mord\u00f3r\u00ebo. Isil''\" (Quenya. 'Sun. I am And\u00faril who once was Narsil, sword of Elendil. The slaves of Mordor shall flee from me. Moon.'), and another inscription on the hilt ''Narsil essenya, macil meletya; Telchar carn\u00e9ron N\u00e1varotesse'' (Quenya. Narsil is my name, a mighty sword; Telchar made me in Nogrod)\n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] suggested that Narsil was introduced during the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' rather spontaneously: \"It is possible that the Sword that was Broken actually emerged from the verse '[[All that is Gold Does Not Glitter|All that is gold does not glitter]]': on this view, in the earliest form of the verse ... the words ''a king may yet be without crown, A blade that was broken be brandished'' were no more than a further exemplification of the general moral [that not everything is what it appears to be].\"<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', p. 137</ref> Following this, references to the Sword were introduced during major recastings of \"At the Sign of the [[Prancing Pony]]\" and \"The [[Council of Elrond]]\" chapters.<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', pp. 77-80, 120.</ref>\n\nOriginally the sword was only referred to as \"the Sword of Elendil\" or \"the Broken Sword\"; later the name '''''Branding''''' (from [[Old English]] ''brand'' 'sword') was devised for the Sword Reforged.<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', p. 290</ref> This was replaced by ''And\u00faril'' after the emergence of ''Narsil''.\n\n====Orcrist====\nOrcrist ([[Sindarin]]: '''[[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblin]]-cleaver'''<ref name=\"The Hobbit. p. 62\" group=T/>), a sword in ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', p. 53, 303</ref> was originally forged in [[Gondolin]] and was nicknamed \"'''Biter'''\" by the goblins of the [[Misty Mountains]]. After finding it in a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll]]-hoard, [[Thorin Oakenshield]] carried the sword through the Misty Mountains and [[Mirkwood]] before being taken prisoner by the [[Silvan Elves#Mirkwood|Elves]], and it was laid on his tomb after he died in the Battle of Five Armies. It is the mate of [[#Glamdring|Glamdring]].\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' films]], the sword is found and wielded by Thorin Oakenshield but ends up in the possession of [[Legolas]], who uses it in battle with the Orc Bolg but later returns it to Thorin so that the Dwarf may wield it against Azog the Defiler. Like [[#And\u00faril|And\u00faril]] and Glamdring in the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'' films]], it was not shown to glow in the presence of orcs due to the film-makers fearing that doing that made it resemble a [[lightsaber]]. Although described as the mate of Glamdring in the books, Orcrist in the films takes on a significantly different appearance akin to that of a [[Messer (weapon)|kriegsmesser]], being a two-handed, single-edged sword, with a deep, heavy belly and pronounced curve.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ringil====\n\nRingil ([[Sindarin]]: ''Cold-Star / Cold-Spark'') is a sword wielded by [[Fingolfin]] in ''The Silmarillion'' and ''The Lays of Beleriand''.

An heirloom from many generations of Bard's family and believed by him to have been made in the forges of the [[Durin's folk#Kings of Durin's folk|King under the Mountain]]; Bard recites its history before urging it to \"go now and speed well\" and successfully shooting [[Smaug]]. The arrow was lost with the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragon]]'s corpse in the [[Long Lake (Middle-earth)|Long Lake]].\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' films]], the Black Arrow's significance was elaborated on. Instead of being a regular-sized arrow, the Black Arrow was the size of a short spear, and was used as ammunition for a windlance (a [[Ballista|ballista-type weapon]]) in Dale. All but one were used to defend the city from Smaug during his invasion, but it only broke one of his scales, and Dale was subsequently destroyed. The final Black Arrow was kept by Bard's family as an heirloom. When Smaug attacks Lake Town, Bard attempts to shoot Smaug with a normal longbow, but his arrows inflict no harm to Smaug. After receiving the Black Arrow from his son Bain, Bard constructs an improvised ballista and fires the Black Arrow at Smaug's weak spot, which successfully hits its mark and kills Smaug.\n\n====Dailir====\nDailir is the arrow favoured by [[Beleg]], the great bowman of the [[First Age]] of Middle-earth.

Initially raised as an infantry battalion of the [[East Yorkshire Regiment]], it transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1942. It served as the LAA component of [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Division]] in the [[Tunisian Campaign]], at the [[Operation Avalanche|Salerno]] landings, and through the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] until it was disbanded in 1945.\n\n==8th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment==\n::''For the [[World War I]] equivalent, see [[8th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment]]''\nThe unit was originally formed in May 1940 as '''50th (Holding) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment''', as part of the rapid expansion of the Army with wartime conscripts. On 9 October 1940 it was redesignated '''8th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment''' and it joined [[217th Brigade (United Kingdom)|217th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home)]] when that was formed on 20 October 1940.<ref name = Frederick182>Frederick, p. 182.</ref><ref name = Joslen217>Joslen, p. 380.</ref>\n\n'Home' brigades had a purely static coast defence role. 217th served in Northumbrian Area, then from 12 March 1941 became part of the [[Durham and North Riding County Division]], deployed around [[Teesside]].<ref>Joslen, p. 223.</ref><ref>Collier, Map 20.</ref> During 1941 the battalions progressively left the brigade, mainly to be converted to other roles such as armour or light anti-aircraft (LAA). 8th East Yorkshires was the last remaining unit in the brigade when it left on 24 November 1941.<ref name = Joslen217/> The battalion then briefly served with [[224th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home)]] until 15 December 1941.<ref>Joslen, p. 387.</ref>\n\n==Anti-Aircraft conversion==\nThe battalion was retrained as an LAA unit and officially transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]] on 1 January 1942 as '''115th LAA Regiment''', with 377, 378 and 379 LAA Batteries.<ref name = Frederick182/><ref name = Frederick805>Frederick, pp. 805, 838.</ref><ref name = FarnM>Farndale, Annexes K & M.</ref> [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] was responsible for AA defence of the UK, and 115th LAA Rgt was initially included in its order of battle, but it was deleted on 23 February 1942 and joined [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Division]] the following day.<ref>Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (TNA), Kew]], file WO 212/80.</ref><ref name = Joslen46>Joslen, pp. 75\u20136.</ref>\n[[File:46 inf div -vector.svg|thumb|200px|right|46th Division's formation sign]]\n46th Division was a 'Second Line' formation of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) formed just before the outbreak of war. Its virtually untrained infantry had briefly served in the [[Battle of France]] before being [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated from Dunkirk]]. Lessons from that campaign and the early fighting in the [[Western Desert Campaign|Western Desert]] had been learned, and now every infantry division was to have its own air defence unit, equipped with 48 (later 54) towed [[Bofors 40 mm gun]]s to protect against ground-attack aircraft such as the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' 's feared ''[[Stuka]]''. The plan was to equip one battery in each divisional LAA  regiment with self-propelled guns on truck chassis, but few of these were available until later in the war.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Joslen, p. 130\u20132.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp. 133\u20134, 184.</ref>\n\nWhen 115th LAA Rgt joined, the division was training with [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]] in [[South East England]]. However, in August 1942 it was transferred to [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]], which was preparing for the Allied landings in North Africa ([[Operation Torch]]).<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Collier, Map, 27.</ref>\n\n==Tunisia==\n[[File:British_Army_40_mm_Bofors_near_Tunis_1943.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bofors gun and crew in action near Tunis, May 1943.]]\nThe Torch landings began on 8 November 1942, and First Army's units and formations were progressively fed into the fighting. 46th Division's [[139th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|139th Brigade]] sailed on 24 December, accompanied by 379 LAA Bty; the rest of the division embarked on 6 January 1943 and landed on 17 January, by which time the focus of the campaign was in [[Tunisian Campaign|Tunisia]].<ref name = Joslen46/> By midnight on 13/14 February, the division was in the line, holding the sector nearest the coast.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 284.</ref> During the hurried reorganisation caused by the [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]] the division's brigades were split up, each with attached artillery units. When the [[Axis powers|Axis]] launched [[Operation Ochsenkopf]] on 26 February the main weight fell on 139th Bde on the coast, which was forced back from a number of positions over the next month. Harder fighting came against [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th Bde]] in the Hunt's Gap area. The division counter-attacked on 29 March and had regained all its positions by 1 April.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 326\u20138, 389.</ref>\n\nMoving and deploying AA guns in the rough country with underpowered gun tractors was difficult but necessary as units in the forward areas were subjected to regular dive-bombing and ground attacks. Ammunition expenditure by the LAA batteries was high, and supply was sometimes  erratic. With greater experience of 'snap' actions against fast low-flying aircraft, Bofors gun units increasingly abandoned using the [[Kerrison Predictor]] in favour of the simple 'Stiffkey Stick' deflection sight.<ref>Routledge, pp. 182-4.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]'s victory at [[Battle of Wadi Akarit|Wadi Akarit]], 128th Bde was part of the force sent by First Army to cut the retreat of the Axis forces, even though Army HQ did not consider it completely ready for battle. As a preliminary to the main attack on the Fondouk Pass, it was tasked with capturing and holding crossings over Wadi Marguellil and then the high ground beyond, which it successfully achieved on 7/8 April.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 379\u201382.</ref> First Army began its final offensive on [[Tunis]] ([[Operation Vulcan]]) on 22 April. 46th Division attacked with strong artillery and tank support towards some hills near Sebkret el Kourzia in an effort to crack open the position for the armour to pass through. In the event the armoured formtions had five days' hard fighting before they could get through. Axis air attacks were maintained until 25 April, doing considerable damage, but tailed off thereafter.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 434\u20136, 440\u20131.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp 184\u20135.</ref>\n\nBy early May the Axis forces were crumbling, and a final thrust ([[Operation Strike]]) took the First Army into Tunis on 7 May; the Axis forces surrendered on 13 May.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 448\u201357.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp 185\u20136.</ref> At the end of the campaign 115th LAA Rgt claimed 58 enemy aircraft destroyed for the expenditure of 22,748 rounds (some of the rounds fired would have been against ground targets).<ref>Routledge, p. 187.</ref>\n\n==Italy==\n===Salerno===\n46th Division was assigned to Force 141 (later [[15th Army Group]]) for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] but was not employed.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Instead it was used to carry out the assault landing at [[Salerno]] on the Italian mainland ([[Operation Avalanche]]) on 9 September. The division concentrated at [[Bizerte]] from its training areas in mid-August.{{efn|Among the AA defences planned for the beachheads were smokescreens. There was an air raid alert while 46th Division carried out a practice landing at Bizerte and the smokescreen was activated. A low-flying German fighter flew through the screen firing at random, and seriously wounded the corps commander, Lt-Gen [[Brian Horrocks]].<ref>Horrocks, p. 175.</ref> The smoke screen did, however, protect 46th Division's convoy when it was bombed while laying at anchor in Bizerte Bay on the night of 6/7 September.<ref>Molony, Vol V, p. 273.</ref>}} The division was to land a brigade on beaches at the northern (left hand) end of the landing area. The beaches would be secured by specialist 'Beach Bricks' including heavy and light AA batteries, and the infantry division's own LAA batteries would then assist with beach defence as they arrived, paying particular attention to exit routes and assembly areas. In 46th Division's sector this worked reasonably well: although the invasion convoy was bombed during the preceding night and the leading infantry and Beach Brick troops landed under shellfire and into immediate firefights, the AA guns got ashore and long-range [[P-38 Lightning]] fighters kept off most ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' air attacks by day. By 23.00 46th Division was landing in waves and no counter-attack had yet developed. However, a week-long battle for Salerno and its hinterland developed, with more and more reinforcements squeezing onto the beaches, and the ''Luftwaffe'' concentrating its attacks on the beaches and shipping. Finally, on 16 September the Germans withdrew and 46th Division swung northwards towards [[Naples]].<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 259\u201360, 274, 278\u201380, 284\u20137, 292, 318, 331.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp. 270\u20133.</ref>\n\n===Naples to the Garigliano===\n46th Division fought its way through the high ground north of Salerno, and then the armour drove across the Plain of Naples to the city itself on 1 October.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 337\u201344.</ref> Next the force moved up for the assault crossing of the [[Volturno]]. The division's attack on the night of 12/13 October was almost unopposed except in one sector, and it had two brigade bridgeheads by nightfall on 13 October. However, this was partly because the Germans had chosen to defend the wide marshy area across the river, and meanwhile their aircraft were very active in attempting to deny the other crossings and to disrupt the bridging operations, with frequent attacks using [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] [[Fighter-bomber]]s.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 438, 443\u20134.</ref><ref>Routledge, p. 283.</ref>\n[[File:The_British_Army_in_Italy_1944_NA10708.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bofors gun of 379 Bty, 115 LAA Rgt, in Italy, 7 January 1944.]]\nAfter the Volturno, the ''Luftwaffe'' was rarely seen and AA engagements became uncommon as 46th Division worked its way up the coastal plain past Monte Camino to the German [[Winter Line]].<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Routledge, p. 281.</ref><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 445\u20136, 450.</ref> The division's next major operation was a failed assault crossing of the [[Garigliano]] on the night of 19/20 January 1944 intended to assist [[II Corps (United States)|II US Corps]] crossing of the [[Battle of the Rapido River|Rapido]] (part of the attacks on [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]).<ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 616\u20137.</ref> Afterwards the division was involved in hill fighting between 26 January and 9 February, taking Monte Furlito and Monte Purgatorio but failing at Monte Faito. The attacks were then called off in rain, sleet and snow.<ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 634\u20136.</ref>\n\n===Rest and retraining===\nIn early 1944 [[Allied Armies in Italy]] (AAI) instituted a procedure of shipping exhausted British formations (without their equipment) to [[Middle East Command]] for rest and retraining. The first of these was 46th Division, which embarked on 16 March, arriving in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] on 22 March and moving up into [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] at the end of the month. Rested and reinforced, the division retraced its journey in June, landing back in Italy on 3 July and taking over [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]]'s guns and vehicles. However, because of AAI's increasing manpower shortage, many of the infantry reinforcements were former AA gunners who had been redeployed. Even divisional LAA units like 115th LAA Rgt had to give up one troop per battery, reducing the number of guns from 54 to 36 guns. This was made possible by the near total air supremacy now enjoyed by the Allies in Italy.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 13, 423, 448\u20139.</ref><ref>Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, p. 231.</ref><ref>Routledge, p. 278.</ref> Meanwhile, the lack of AA targets meant that the Bofors guns could be used for other purposes. They were incorporated into ground defence fireplans, and were also used to harass known enemy machine guns or mortar posts, or to engage buildings and bunkers. A useful role was to fire on fixed lines to mark boundaries in an advance, the troops being able to watch the lines of tracer. Some infantry commanders requested their LAA units to 'brown' an area from which an attack seemed imminent.<ref>Routledge, p. 280.</ref>\n\n===Gothic Line===\nOn its return 46th Division joined Eighth Army on the east side of Italy to take part in breaching the [[Gothic Line]] (Operation Olive). The initial operations starting on 26 August began well, with 46th Division taking the [[Montegridolfo]] village complex on 31 August and then continuing its advance to the [[Conca (river)|Conca]] and [[Morciano di Romagna|Morciano]]. It then moved to clear the Croce\u2013[[Gemmano]] high ground to protect Eighth Army's flank as it advanced on [[Coriano]], but here the division ran into stiff opposition in the [[Battle of Gemmano]]. Only on 17 September were the Germans cleared out of their defences and Eighth Army able to close up to the next line of defences, the [[Rimini Line]]. This was taken at a rush by 21 September.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 128\u201330, 225, 238, 243\u20134, 249\u201351, 266\u20139, 277\u201380, 288\u201396.</ref>\n\nEighth Army continued its advance, struggling as much with bad weather and swollen rivers as with stubborn enemy opposition. 46th Division was now due for a rest, having been in almost continuous operations for two months, and it was relieved in mid-October, though it was back in the line on 31 October.<ref>Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 352\u20134, 400, 406\u20137, 409, 427.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nBy now the continuing manpower crisis and the near-total absence of the ''Luftwaffe'' meant that deeper cuts were made in AA provision. In November 1944 the British infantry divisions in Italy lost their LAA regiments, with 115th LAA Rgt leaving 46th Division on 8 November.

Initially raised as an infantry battalion of the [[East Yorkshire Regiment]], it transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1942. It served as the LAA component of [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Division]] in the [[Tunisian Campaign]], at the [[Operation Avalanche|Salerno]] landings, and through the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] until it was disbanded in 1945.\n\n==8th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment==\n::''For the [[World War I]] equivalent, see [[8th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment]]''\nThe unit was originally formed in May 1940 as '''50th (Holding) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment''', as part of the rapid expansion of the Army with wartime conscripts. On 9 October 1940 it was redesignated '''8th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment''' and it joined [[217th Brigade (United Kingdom)|217th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home)]] when that was formed on 20 October 1940.<ref name = Frederick182>Frederick, p. 182.</ref><ref name = Joslen217>Joslen, p. 380.</ref> \n\n'Home' brigades had a purely static coast defence role. 217th served in Northumbrian Area, then from 12 March 1941 became part of the [[Durham and North Riding County Division]], deployed around [[Teesside]].<ref>Joslen, p. 223.</ref><ref>Collier, Map 20.</ref> During 1941 the battalions progressively left the brigade, mainly to be converted to other roles such as armour or light anti-aircraft (LAA). 8th East Yorkshires was the last remaining unit in the brigade when it left on 24 November 1941.<ref name = Joslen217/> The battalion then briefly served with [[224th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home)]] until 15 December 1941.<ref>Joslen, p. 387.</ref>\n\n==Anti-Aircraft conversion==\nThe battalion was retrained as an LAA unit and officially transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]] on 1 January 1942 as '''115th LAA Regiment''', with 377, 378 and 379 LAA Batteries.<ref name = Frederick182/><ref name = Frederick805>Frederick, pp. 805, 838.</ref><ref name = FarnM>Farndale, Annexes K & M.</ref> [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] was responsible for AA defence of the UK, and 115th LAA Rgt was initially included in its order of battle, but it was deleted on 23 February 1942 and joined [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Division]] the following day.<ref>Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (TNA), Kew]], file WO 212/80.</ref><ref name = Joslen46>Joslen, pp. 75\u20136.</ref>\n[[File:46 inf div -vector.svg|thumb|200px|right|46th Division's formation sign]]\n46th Division was a 'Second Line' formation of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) formed just before the outbreak of war. Its virtually untrained infantry had briefly served in the [[Battle of France]] before being [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated from Dunkirk]]. Lessons from that campaign and the early fighting in the [[Western Desert Campaign|Western Desert]] had been learned, and now every infantry division was to have its own air defence unit, equipped with 48 (later 54) towed [[Bofors 40 mm gun]]s to protect against ground-attack aircraft such as the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' 's feared ''[[Stuka]]''. The plan was to equip one battery in each divisional LAA  regiment with self-propelled guns on truck chassis, but few of these were available until later in the war.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Joslen, p. 130\u20132.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp. 133\u20134, 184.</ref>\n\nWhen 115th LAA Rgt joined, the division was training with [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]] in [[South East England]]. However, in August 1942 it was transferred to [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]], which was preparing for the Allied landings in North Africa ([[Operation Torch]]).<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Collier, Map, 27.</ref>\n\n==Tunisia==\n[[File:British_Army_40_mm_Bofors_near_Tunis_1943.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bofors gun and crew in action near Tunis, May 1943.]]\nThe Torch landings began on 8 November 1942, and First Army's units and formations were progressively fed into the fighting. 46th Division's [[139th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|139th Brigade]] sailed on 24 December, accompanied by 379 LAA Bty; the rest of the division embarked on 6 January 1943 and landed on 17 January, by which time the focus of the campaign was in [[Tunisian Campaign|Tunisia]].<ref name = Joslen46/> By midnight on 13/14 February, the division was in the line, holding the sector nearest the coast.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 284.</ref> During the hurried reorganisation caused by the [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]] the division's brigades were split up, each with attached artillery units. When the [[Axis powers|Axis]] launched [[Operation Ochsenkopf]] on 26 February the main weight fell on 139th Bde on the coast, which was forced back from a number of positions over the next month. Harder fighting came against [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th Bde]] in the Hunt's Gap area. The division counter-attacked on 29 March and had regained all its positions by 1 April.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 326\u20138, 389.</ref>\n\nMoving and deploying AA guns in the rough country with underpowered gun tractors was difficult but necessary as units in the forward areas were subjected to regular dive-bombing and ground attacks. Ammunition expenditure by the LAA batteries was high, and supply was sometimes  erratic. With greater experience of 'snap' actions against fast low-flying aircraft, Bofors gun units increasingly abandoned using the [[Kerrison Predictor]] in favour of the simple 'Stiffkey Stick' deflection sight.<ref>Routledge, pp. 182-4.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]'s victory at [[Battle of Wadi Akarit|Wadi Akarit]], 128th Bde was part of the force sent by First Army to cut the retreat of the Axis forces, even though Army HQ did not consider it completely ready for battle. As a preliminary to the main attack on the Fondouk Pass, it was tasked with capturing and holding crossings over Wadi Marguellil and then the high ground beyond, which it successfully achieved on 7/8 April.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 379\u201382.</ref> First Army began its final offensive on [[Tunis]] ([[Operation Vulcan]]) on 22 April. 46th Division attacked with strong artillery and tank support towards some hills near Sebkret el Kourzia in an effort to crack open the position for the armour to pass through. In the event the armoured formtions had five days' hard fighting before they could get through. Axis air attacks were maintained until 25 April, doing considerable damage, but tailed off thereafter.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 434\u20136, 440\u20131.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp 184\u20135.</ref>\n\nBy early May the Axis forces were crumbling, and a final thrust ([[Operation Strike]]) took the First Army into Tunis on 7 May; the Axis forces surrendered on 13 May.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 448\u201357.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp 185\u20136.</ref> At the end of the campaign 115th LAA Rgt claimed 58 enemy aircraft destroyed for the expenditure of 22,748 rounds (some of the rounds fired would have been against ground targets).<ref>Routledge, p. 187.</ref>\n\n==Italy==\n===Salerno===\n46th Division was assigned to Force 141 (later [[15th Army Group]]) for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] but was not employed.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Instead it was used to carry out the assault landing at [[Salerno]] on the Italian mainland ([[Operation Avalanche]]) on 9 September. The division concentrated at [[Bizerte]] from its training areas in mid-August.{{efn|Among the AA defences planned for the beachheads were smokescreens. There was an air raid alert while 46th Division carried out a practice landing at Bizerte and the smokescreen was activated. A low-flying German fighter flew through the screen firing at random, and seriously wounded the corps commander, Lt-Gen [[Brian Horrocks]].<ref>Horrocks, p. 175.</ref> The smoke screen did, however, protect 46th Division's convoy when it was bombed while laying at anchor in Bizerte Bay on the night of 6/7 September.<ref>Molony, Vol V, p. 273.</ref>}} The division was to land a brigade on beaches at the northern (left hand) end of the landing area. The beaches would be secured by specialist 'Beach Bricks' including heavy and light AA batteries, and the infantry division's own LAA batteries would then assist with beach defence as they arrived, paying particular attention to exit routes and assembly areas. In 46th Division's sector this worked reasonably well: although the invasion convoy was bombed during the preceding night and the leading infantry and Beach Brick troops landed under shellfire and into immediate firefights, the AA guns got ashore and long-range [[P-38 Lightning]] fighters kept off most ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' air attacks by day. By 23.00 46th Division was landing in waves and no counter-attack had yet developed. However, a week-long battle for Salerno and its hinterland developed, with more and more reinforcements squeezing onto the beaches, and the ''Luftwaffe'' concentrating its attacks on the beaches and shipping. Finally, on 16 September the Germans withdrew and 46th Division swung northwards towards [[Naples]].<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 259\u201360, 274, 278\u201380, 284\u20137, 292, 318, 331.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp. 270\u20133.</ref>\n\n===Naples to the Garigliano===\n46th Division fought its way through the high ground north of Salerno, and then the armour drove across the Plain of Naples to the city itself on 1 October.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 337\u201344.</ref> Next the force moved up for the assault crossing of the [[Volturno]]. The division's attack on the night of 12/13 October was almost unopposed except in one sector, and it had two brigade bridgeheads by nightfall on 13 October. However, this was partly because the Germans had chosen to defend the wide marshy area across the river, and meanwhile their aircraft were very active in attempting to deny the other crossings and to disrupt the bridging operations, with frequent attacks using [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] [[Fighter-bomber]]s.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 438, 443\u20134.</ref><ref>Routledge, p. 283.</ref>\n[[File:The_British_Army_in_Italy_1944_NA10708.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bofors gun of 379 Bty, 115 LAA Rgt, in Italy, 7 January 1944.]]\nAfter the Volturno, the ''Luftwaffe'' was rarely seen and AA engagements became uncommon as 46th Division worked its way up the coastal plain past Monte Camino to the German [[Winter Line]].<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Routledge, p. 281.</ref><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 445\u20136, 450.</ref> The division's next major operation was a failed assault crossing of the [[Garigliano]] on the night of 19/20 January 1944 intended to assist [[II Corps (United States)|II US Corps]] crossing of the [[Battle of the Rapido River|Rapido]] (part of the attacks on [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]).<ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 616\u20137.</ref> Afterwards the division was involved in hill fighting between 26 January and 9 February, taking Monte Furlito and Monte Purgatorio but failing at Monte Faito. The attacks were then called off in rain, sleet and snow.<ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 634\u20136.</ref>\n\n===Rest and retraining===\nIn early 1944 [[Allied Armies in Italy]] (AAI) instituted a procedure of shipping exhausted British formations (without their equipment) to [[Middle East Command]] for rest and retraining. The first of these was 46th Division, which embarked on 16 March, arriving in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] on 22 March and moving up into [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] at the end of the month. Rested and reinforced, the division retraced its journey in June, landing back in Italy on 3 July and taking over [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]]'s guns and vehicles. However, because of AAI's increasing manpower shortage, many of the infantry reinforcements were former AA gunners who had been redeployed. Even divisional LAA units like 115th LAA Rgt had to give up one troop per battery, reducing the number of guns from 54 to 36 guns. This was made possible by the near total air supremacy now enjoyed by the Allies in Italy.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 13, 423, 448\u20139.</ref><ref>Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, p. 231.</ref><ref>Routledge, p. 278.</ref> Meanwhile the lack of AA targets meant that the Bofors guns could be used for other purposes. They were incorporated into ground defence fireplans, and were also used to harass known enemy machine guns or mortar posts, or to engage buildings and bunkers. A useful role was to fire on fixed lines to mark boundaries in an advance, the troops being able to watch the lines of tracer. Some infantry commanders requested their LAA units to 'brown' an area from which an attack seemed imminent.<ref>Routledge, p. 280.</ref>\n\n===Gothic Line===\nOn its return 46th Division joined Eighth Army on the east side of Italy to take part in breaching the [[Gothic Line]] (Operation Olive). The initial operations starting on 26 August began well, with 46th Division taking the [[Montegridolfo]] village complex on 31 August and then continuing its advance to the [[Conca (river)|Conca]] and [[Morciano di Romagna|Morciano]]. It then moved to clear the Croce\u2013[[Gemmano]] high ground to protect Eighth Army's flank as it advanced on [[Coriano]], but here the division ran into stiff opposition in the [[Battle of Gemmano]]. Only on 17 September were the Germans cleared out of their defences and Eighth Army able to close up to the next line of defences, the [[Rimini Line]]. This was taken at a rush by 21 September.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 128\u201330, 225, 238, 243\u20134, 249\u201351, 266\u20139, 277\u201380, 288\u201396.</ref>\n\nEighth Army continued its advance, struggling as much with bad weather and swollen rivers as with stubborn enemy opposition. 46th Division was now due for a rest, having been in almost continuous operations for two months, and it was relieved in mid-October, though it was back in the line on 31 October.<ref>Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 352\u20134, 400, 406\u20137, 409, 427.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nBy now the continuing manpower crisis and the near-total absence of the ''Luftwaffe'' meant that deeper cuts were made in AA provision. In November 1944 the British infantry divisions in Italy lost their LAA regiments, with 115th LAA Rgt leaving 46th Division on 8 November. It was then disbanded on 8 January 1945 and its personnel drafted to other roles.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref name = Frederick805/><ref name = FarnM/>{{efn|A new 115 LAA Rgt was reformed in April 1947 from the war-raised personnel of [[129th (First Surrey Rifles) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|129th (First Surrey Rifles) LAA Rgt]] (TA), but this only lasted a month before it was disbanded.<ref>Frederick, pp. 840, 963.</ref>}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/index.html Basil Collier, ''History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Military Series: The Defence of the United Kingdom'', London: HM Stationery Office, 1957/Uckfield: Naval & Military, 2004, ISBN 978-1-84574-055-9.]\n* Gen Sir [[Martin Farndale]], ''History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery: The Years of Defeat: Europe and North Africa, 1939\u20131941'', Woolwich: Royal Artillery Institution, 1988/London: Brasseys, 1996, ISBN 1-85753-080-2.\n* J.B.M.

{"title_page": "1913 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Cleanup|reason=drop caps as per [[MOS:HEADINGS]]|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1913 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was the 5th season of the Auckland Rugby league. It followed the [[1912 Auckland Rugby League season]].\n\nThe first grade competition began on 3 May with the same 6 teams that had competed in the 1912 season, however [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] pulled out of the competition midway through the season as they struggled to put a full team on the field. The Eden Ramblers also pulled out at the same time. [[North Shore Albions]] were crowned champions for the first time.\n\nOther clubs competing in lower grades were [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote Ramblers]] now known as the Northcote Tigers, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie Wanderers]], who later became known as the Ellerslie Eagles. A match was also played between Avondale and New Lynn in [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] on 13 September. The match was won by New Lynn by 23 points to 8.\n\n===Charles Savory Controversy===\nIn a match involving Ponsonby and Manukau in Onehunga, [[Charles Savory]] was accused of kicking an opponent. The incident was not seen by the referee but an [[Auckland Rugby League]] official claimed to have seen it and as a result Savory was banned for life by Auckland Rugby League. Savory had been selected to play for New Zealand on their tour of Australia and as a result of the ban was unable to make the trip. When the evidence was presented to New Zealand League they said that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the penalty and refused to confirm it. Auckland Rugby League then decided to strike Savory off the list of registered players thus making him ineligible to play in Auckland. Auckland selector [[Ronald MacDonald (rugby league)|Ronald MacDonald]] chose Savory to play against Wellington in their match on 23 August but was told at an Auckland Rugby League meeting that he was ineligible and they questioned why he had chosen him to play. MacDonald replied \"one reason is because he is one of the best forwards in the Dominion. What was he suspended for?\". A lengthy discussion followed and MacDonald refused to withdraw Savory's name from selection and a motion was then passed that MacDonald be removed from his position as Auckland selector. This was carried unanimously with Mr Angus Campbell appointed selector, and [[Morgan Hayward]] chosen to replace Savory in the side for the match with Wellington.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Football Resentment/League Selector Replaced/\"Savory Shall Not Play\"\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=199\n| date = 1913-08-21\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130821.2.87\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===Death of a Player===\nTragedy struck in May in a 3rd grade match between [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] when 26 year old Adolphus Theodore Bust was killed.

The other two men rose to their feet to carry on playing but Bust remained stationary on the ground. Dr. Baber was called to attend from his residence in Remuera but he found that Bust's spinal cord was fractured near the base of the skull and he recommended he be taken to hospital however Bust's father decided to have him taken to his home in Ellerslie.

North Shore sent a strong team south but were without [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Stan Walters]] who were representing New Zealand against the touring New South Wales side.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 7 September\n| time =3:00\n| home =Sydenham\n| score =13\u20138\n| report =<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Thacker Shield Match\n| page =4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=L| issue=15400\n| date = 1913-09-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19130908.2.8.1\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n| away =North Shore Albions\n| try1 =Kirton, Smythe 2\n| con1 =Smith 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =Pullen, Rogers\n| con2 =[[George Seagar]]\n| pen2 =\n| stadium =Christchurch Showgrounds\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n==Representative Season==\n1913 was a busy year for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative team as they played 8 matches for a 7 win, 1 loss record.

"text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Cleanup|reason=drop caps as per [[MOS:HEADINGS]]|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1913 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was the 5th season of the Auckland Rugby league. It followed the [[1912 Auckland Rugby League season]].\n\nThe first grade competition began on 3 May with the same 6 teams that had competed in the 1912 season, however [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] pulled out of the competition midway through the season as they struggled to put a full team on the field. The Eden Ramblers also pulled out at the same time. [[North Shore Albions]] were crowned champions for the first time.\n\nOther clubs competing in lower grades were [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote Ramblers]] now known as the Northcote Tigers, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie Wanderers]], who later became known as the Ellerslie Eagles. A match was also played between Avondale and New Lynn in [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] on 13 September. The match was won by New Lynn by 23 points to 8.\n\n===Charles Savory Controversy===\nIn a match involving Ponsonby and Manukau in Onehunga, [[Charles Savory]] was accused of kicking an opponent. The incident was not seen by the referee but an [[Auckland Rugby League]] official claimed to have seen it and as a result Savory was banned for life by Auckland Rugby League. Savory had been selected to play for New Zealand on their tour of Australia and as a result of the ban was unable to make the trip. When the evidence was presented to New Zealand League they said that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the penalty and refused to confirm it. Auckland Rugby League then decided to strike Savory off the list of registered players thus making him ineligible to play in Auckland. Auckland selector [[Ronald MacDonald (rugby league)|Ronald MacDonald]] chose Savory to play against Wellington in their match on 23 August but was told at an Auckland Rugby League meeting that he was ineligible and they questioned why he had chosen him to play. MacDonald replied \"one reason is because he is one of the best forwards in the Dominion. What was he suspended for?\". A lengthy discussion followed and MacDonald refused to withdraw Savory's name from selection and a motion was then passed that MacDonald be removed from his position as Auckland selector. This was carried unanimously with Mr Angus Campbell appointed selector, and [[Morgan Hayward]] chosen to replace Savory in the side for the match with Wellington.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Football Resentment/League Selector Replaced/\"Savory Shall Not Play\"\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=199\n| date = 1913-08-21\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130821.2.87\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===Death of a Player===\nTragedy struck in May in a 3rd grade match between [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] when 26 year old Adolphus Theodore Bust was killed. The death occurred at Ellerslie. He was said to have collided with an opposing player and the two of them fell to the ground with a third player falling on top of them. The other two men rose to their feet to carry on playing but Bust remained stationary on the ground. Dr. Baber was called to attend from his residence in Remuera but he found that Bust's spinal cord was fractured near the base of the skull and he recommended he be taken to hospital however Bust's father decided to have him taken to his home in Ellerslie. He was unable to be revived and died at 8.30am the following morning.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Footballers Death/Spinal Cord Fractured/Accident at Ellerslie\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=124\n| date = 1913-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130526.2.59\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref> After the incident the deceased father said he witnessed the incident and was satisfied that it was an accident. Martin Ellis, the player involved in the tackle said that he was running down the field and Bust was waiting to tackle him and had dived and caught Ellis by the legs but his neck struck him on the hip and they both fell to the ground. The coroner returned the verdict that nobody was to blame for the death.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Killed at Football\n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=125\n| date = 1913-05-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130527.2.86\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1912 Auckland Rugby League season|1912]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=5th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=\t1913}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1914 Auckland Rugby League season|1914]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Myers Cup (First Grade Competition)==\nEighteen regular season matches were played before [[North Shore Albions]] were awarded the title.\n\n===Final Standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Albions]]\n|7||5||1||1||80||55||'''11'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|7||4||0||3||117||53||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|7||3||2||2||60||46||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby RFC|Ponsonby United]]\n|7||4||0||3||103||65||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Eden Ramblers]]\n|5||1||0||4||18||124||'''2'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]]\n|5||0||1||4||21||56||'''1'''\n|-\n|}\n\n===Myers Cup Fixtures===\n======Round 1======\n[[Karl Ifwersen]] had switched codes and made his debut appearance for North Shore.
