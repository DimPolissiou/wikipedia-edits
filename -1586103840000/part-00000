Beads can be woven together with specialized [[yarn|thread]], strung onto thread or soft, flexible [[wire]], or adhered to a surface (e.g. [[Cloth|fabric]], [[clay]]).\n\n==Types of beads==\n[[Image:Cloisonnebeads.jpg|thumb|right|Cloisonn\u00e9 beads]]\nBeads can be divided into several types of overlapping categories based on different criteria such as the materials from which they are made, the process used in their manufacturing, the place or period of origin, the patterns on their surface, or their general shape. In some cases, such as [[millefiori]] and [[cloisonn\u00e9]] beads, multiple categories may overlap in an interdependent fashion.\n\n==Components==\nBeads can be made of many different materials. The earliest beads were made of a variety of natural materials which, after they were gathered, could be readily drilled and shaped. As humans became capable of obtaining and working with more difficult materials, those materials were added to the range of available substances. But nowadays synthetic materials were added.\n\nIn modern manufacturing, the most common bead materials are wood, [[plastic]], [[glass]], [[metal]], and [[Rock (geology)|stone]].\n\n=== Natural materials ===\nBeads are still made from many naturally occurring materials, both organic (i.e., of [[animal]]- or [[plant]]-based origin) and inorganic (purely [[mineral]] origin). However, some of these materials now routinely undergo some extra processing beyond mere shaping and drilling such as color enhancement via [[dyes]] or irradiation.\n\nThe natural organics include [[bone]], [[Coral (precious)|coral]], [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], [[ivory]], [[seed]]s (such as [[tagua]] nuts), [[animal shell]], and [[wood]]. For most of human history [[pearl]]s were the ultimate precious beads of natural origin because of their rarity; the modern [[cultured pearl|pearl-culturing process]] has made them far more common. [[Amber]] and [[jet (lignite)|jet]] are also of natural organic origin although both are the result of partial [[fossil]]ization.\n\nThe natural inorganics include various types of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s, ranging from [[gemstone]]s to common [[mineral]]s, and [[metal]]s. Of the latter, only a few [[precious metal]]s occur in pure forms, but other purified [[base metal]]s may as well be placed in this category along with certain naturally occurring alloys such as [[electrum]]. There are also paper beads.\n\n=== Synthetic materials ===\n[[Image:Crystbeads.jpg|thumb|right|[[Swarovski]] crystal beads ({{nowrap|6 mm&ndash;8 mm}}), pendant 3 cm]]\n\n[[File:Swedish patent 217875 S\u00e4tt att f\u00f6r arbetsterapi.pdf|thumb|upright|page=3|Swedish patent 217875: The plastic bead pegboard (1962).]]\n\nThe oldest-surviving synthetic materials used for beadmaking have generally been [[ceramic]]s: [[pottery]] and [[glass]]. Beads were also made from ancient alloys such as [[bronze]] and [[brass]], but as those were more vulnerable to [[oxidation]] they have generally been less well-preserved at archaeological sites.\n\nMany different subtypes of [[glass]] are now used for beadmaking, some of which have their own component-specific names. [[Lead crystal]] beads have a high percentage of [[lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] in the glass formula, increasing the [[refractive index]]. Most of the other named glass types have their formulations and patterns inseparable from the manufacturing process.\n\nSmall, colourful, [[fusible plastic beads]] (some brands are Nabbi, Hama, Perler, and Pyssla) can be placed on a solid plastic-backed peg array to form designs and then melted together with a [[Ironing|clothes iron]]; alternatively, they can be strung into necklaces and bracelets or woven into keychains. Fusible beads come in many colors and degrees of [[transparency and translucency|transparency]]/[[opacity (optics)|opacity]], including varieties that glow in the dark or have internal [[glitter]]; peg boards come in various shapes and several geometric patterns. Plastic toy beads, made by chopping plastic tubes into short pieces, were introduced in 1958 by Munkplast AB in [[Munka-Ljungby]], Sweden. Known as [[Indian bead]]s, they were originally sewn together to form ribbons. The pegboard for bead designs was invented in the early 1960s (patented 1962, patent granted 1967) by Gunnar Knutsson in V\u00e4llingby, Sweden, as a therapy for elderly homes; the pegboard later gained popularity as a toy for children.<ref>[http://was.prv.se/spd/search?content=SE+217875&lang=en&tab=1&hits=true Swedish patent 217875: S\u00e4tt att f\u00f6r arbetsterapi e.d. framst\u00e4lla permanenta, m\u00f6nstrade skivor samt m\u00f6strad skiva framst\u00e4lld enligt s\u00e4ttet], applied April 24, 1962; granted July 6, 1967; published December 19, 1967.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2YdeOnMtPI|title=Danya's Perler beads 2014 (four year old)|last=Arun Jagatheesan|date=30 October 2014|accessdate=23 October 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The bead designs were glued to cardboard or [[Masonite]] boards and used as [[trivet]]s. Later, when the beads were made of [[polyethylene]], it became possible to fuse them with a flat iron. Hama come in three sizes: mini (diameter 2.5&nbsp;mm), midi (5&nbsp;mm) and maxi (10&nbsp;mm). Perler beads come in two sizes called classic (5&nbsp;mm) and biggie (10&nbsp;mm). Pyssla beads (by [[IKEA]]) only come in one size (5&nbsp;mm).\n\n==Manufacturing==\nModern [[mass production|mass-produced]] beads are generally shaped by [[carving]] or [[casting]], depending on the material and desired effect. In some cases, more specialized [[metalworking]] or [[glass]]working techniques may be employed, or a combination of multiple techniques and materials may be used such as in [[cloisonn\u00e9]].\n\n=== Glassworking ===\n[[Image:Pressedglass.jpg|thumb|right|Pressed glass beads (matte finish with an AB coating)]]\n[[File:Assorted beads in a box 23June2019 arp.jpg|thumb|left|A box of assorted beads]]\nMost glass beads are [[pressed glass]], mass-produced by preparing a molten batch of [[Glass coloring and color marking|glass of the desired color]] and pouring it into molds to form the desired shape. This is also true of most [[plastic]] beads.\n\nA smaller and more expensive subset of glass and lead crystal beads are cut into precise faceted shapes on an individual basis. This was once done by hand but has largely been taken over by precision machinery.\n\n\"Fire-polished\" faceted beads are a less expensive alternative to hand-cut faceted glass or crystal. They derive their name from the second half of a two-part process: first, the glass batch is poured into round bead molds, then they are faceted with a grinding wheel. The faceted beads are then poured onto a tray and briefly reheated just long enough to melt the surface, \"polishing\" out any minor surface irregularities from the grinding wheel.\n\n==== Specialized glass techniques and types ====\n[[Image:Dichroicclose.jpg|thumb|upright|Dichroic beads ({{convert|10|mm}})]]\n[[Image:Furnaceglass.jpg|thumb|Furnace glass beads]]\nThere are several specialized glassworking techniques that create a distinctive appearance throughout the body of the resulting beads, which are then primarily referred to by the glass type.\n\nIf the glass batch is used to create a large massive block instead of pre-shaping it as it cools, the result may then be carved into smaller items in the same manner as stone. Conversely, glass artisans may make beads by [[lampworking]] the glass on an individual basis; once formed, the beads undergo little or no further shaping after the layers have been properly [[annealing (glass)|anneal]]ed.\n\nMost of these glass subtypes are some form of [[fused glass]], although [[Goldstone (gemstone)|goldstone]] is created by controlling the reductive atmosphere and cooling conditions of the glass batch rather than by fusing separate components together.\n\n[[Dichroic glass]] beads incorporate a semitransparent microlayer of metal between two or more layers. [[Fibre optic]] glass beads have an eyecatching [[chatoyant]] effect across the grain.\n\nThere are also several ways to fuse many small glass canes together into a multicolored pattern, resulting in [[millefiori]] beads or [[chevron bead]]s (sometimes called \"trade beads\"). \"Furnace glass\" beads encase a multicolored core in a transparent exterior layer which is then annealed in a furnace.\n\nMore economically, millefiori beads can also be made by limiting the patterning process to long, narrow canes or rods known as murrine. Thin cross-sections, or \"decals\", can then be cut from the murrine and fused into the surface of a plain glass bead.\n\n== Shapes ==\n\n'''Round'''\n\nThis is the most common shape of beads that are strung on wire to create necklaces, and bracelets. The shape of the round beads lay together and are pleasing to the eye. Rounds beads can be made of glass, stone, ceramic, metal, or wood.\n\n'''Square or Cubed'''\n\nSquare beads can be to enhance a necklace design as a spacer however a necklace can be strung with just square beads. The necklaces with square beads are used in [[Rosary]] necklaces/prayer necklaces, and wooden or shell ones are made for beachwear.\n\n'''Oval'''\n\n'''Tube'''\n\n'''Potato'''\n'''Hair pipe beads'''\nElk rib bones were the original material for the long, tubular [[hair pipe]] beads.<ref>Dubin 43, 44</ref> Today these beads are commonly made of [[bison]] and [[water buffalo]] bones and are popular for breastplates and chokers among [[Plains Indians]]. Black variations of these beads are made from the animals' horns.\n\n'''Seed beads'''\n{{Main|Seed bead}}\nSeed beads are uniformly shaped spheroidal or tube shaped beads ranging in size from under a millimetre to several millimetres. \"Seed bead\" is a generic term for any small bead. Usually rounded in shape, seed beads are most commonly used for [[Bead weaving|loom]] and [[Bead weaving|off-loom]] bead weaving.\n\n== Place or period of origin ==\n[[Image:Cinnabarbead.jpg|thumb|right|Carved [[Cinnabar]] [[lacquer]] beads]]\n'''African trade beads''' or '''[[slave beads]]''' may be antique beads that were manufactured in Europe and used for trade during the colonial period, such as chevron beads; or they may have been made in West Africa by and for Africans, such as Mauritanian [[Kiffa beads]], Ghanaian and Nigerian [[powder glass beads]], or African-made brass beads.\n\n'''Austrian crystal''' is a generic term for cut lead-crystal beads, based on the location and prestige of the [[Swarovski]] firm.\n\n'''Czech glass''' beads are made in [[Czechia]], in particular an area called [[Jablonec nad Nisou]]. Production of glass beads in the area dates back to the 14th century, though production was depressed under communist rule. Because of this long tradition, their workmanship and quality has an excellent reputation.\n\n'''Vintage beads''', in the collectibles and antique market, refers to items that are at least 25 or more years old. Vintage beads are available in materials that include lucite, plastic, crystal, metal and glass.\n\n=== Miscellaneous ethnic beads ===\n[[Tibet]]an [[Dzi bead]]s and [[Rudraksha bead]]s are used to make Buddhist and Hindu rosaries ([[Prayer beads|malas]]). [[Magatama]] are traditional [[Japan]]ese beads, and [[cinnabar]] was often used for making beads<!--It would be good to add the name of these beads.--> in [[China]]. [[Wampum]] are cylindrical white or purple beads made from [[quahog]] or North Atlantic [[channeled whelk]] shells by northeastern Native American tribes, such as the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] and [[Shinnecock Indian Nation|Shinnecock]].<ref>Dubin, 170-171</ref> [[Job's tears]] are seed beads popular among southeastern Native American tribes. [[Heishe]] are beads made of shells or stones by the [[Kewa Pueblo, New Mexico|Kewa Pueblo people]] of [[New Mexico]].\n[[File:Pomegranate carved in the round MET DP110584.jpg|thumb|[[Pomegranate carved in the round|Bead, depicting a pomegranate]], dated to the [[Assyrian Empire]] of the 8th-century.]]\n\n==Symbolic meaning of beads==\nIn many parts of the world, beads are used for symbolic purposes, for example:\n* [[Prayer beads|use for prayer or devotion]] - e.g. [[rosary beads]] for Roman Catholics, [[misbaha]] for Muslims, [[japamala]]/[[Buddhist prayer beads]]/nenju for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, some Sikhs, [[Confucianism]], [[Tao]]ists/[[Dao]]ists, [[Shinto]], etc.\n* use for anti-tension devices, e.g. [[worry beads]]\n* use as currency e.g. [[Aggrey beads]] from [[Ghana]]\n* use for gaming e.g. [[owari beads]] for [[mankala]]\n* Greek [[komboloi]] beads as in [[Crete]]\n\n==History==\nBeads are thought to be one of the earliest forms of trade between members of the human race.

Beads can be woven together with specialized [[yarn|thread]], strung onto thread or soft, flexible [[wire]], or adhered to a surface (e.g. [[Cloth|fabric]], [[clay]]).\n\n==Types of beads==\n[[Image:Cloisonnebeads.jpg|thumb|right|Cloisonn\u00e9 beads]]\nBeads can be divided into several types of overlapping categories based on different criteria such as the materials from which they are made, the process used in their manufacturing, the place or period of origin, the patterns on their surface, or their general shape. In some cases, such as [[millefiori]] and [[cloisonn\u00e9]] beads, multiple categories may overlap in an interdependent fashion.\n\n==Components==\nBeads can be made of many different materials. The earliest beads were made of a variety of natural materials which, after they were gathered, could be readily drilled and shaped. As humans became capable of obtaining and working with more difficult materials, those materials were added to the range of available substances. But nowadays synthetic materials were added.\n\nIn modern manufacturing, the most common bead materials are wood, [[plastic]], [[glass]], [[metal]], and [[Rock (geology)|stone]].\n\n=== Natural materials ===\nBeads are still made from many naturally occurring materials, both organic (i.e., of [[animal]]- or [[plant]]-based origin) and inorganic (purely [[mineral]] origin). However, some of these materials now routinely undergo some extra processing beyond mere shaping and drilling such as color enhancement via [[dyes]] or irradiation.\n\nThe natural organics include [[bone]], [[Coral (precious)|coral]], [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], [[ivory]], [[seed]]s (such as [[tagua]] nuts), [[animal shell]], and [[wood]]. For most of human history [[pearl]]s were the ultimate precious beads of natural origin because of their rarity; the modern [[cultured pearl|pearl-culturing process]] has made them far more common. [[Amber]] and [[jet (lignite)|jet]] are also of natural organic origin although both are the result of partial [[fossil]]ization.\n\nThe natural inorganics include various types of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s, ranging from [[gemstone]]s to common [[mineral]]s, and [[metal]]s. Of the latter, only a few [[precious metal]]s occur in pure forms, but other purified [[base metal]]s may as well be placed in this category along with certain naturally occurring alloys such as [[electrum]]. There are also paper beads.\n\n=== Synthetic materials ===\n[[Image:Crystbeads.jpg|thumb|right|[[Swarovski]] crystal beads ({{nowrap|6 mm&ndash;8 mm}}), pendant 3 cm]]\n\n[[File:Swedish patent 217875 S\u00e4tt att f\u00f6r arbetsterapi.pdf|thumb|upright|page=3|Swedish patent 217875: The plastic bead pegboard (1962).]]\n\nThe oldest-surviving synthetic materials used for beadmaking have generally been [[ceramic]]s: [[pottery]] and [[glass]]. Beads were also made from ancient alloys such as [[bronze]] and [[brass]], but as those were more vulnerable to [[oxidation]] they have generally been less well-preserved at archaeological sites.\n\nMany different subtypes of [[glass]] are now used for beadmaking, some of which have their own component-specific names. [[Lead crystal]] beads have a high percentage of [[lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] in the glass formula, increasing the [[refractive index]]. Most of the other named glass types have their formulations and patterns inseparable from the manufacturing process.\n\nSmall, colourful, [[fusible plastic beads]] (some brands are Nabbi, Hama, Perler, and Pyssla) can be placed on a solid plastic-backed peg array to form designs and then melted together with a [[Ironing|clothes iron]]; alternatively, they can be strung into necklaces and bracelets or woven into keychains. Fusible beads come in many colors and degrees of [[transparency and translucency|transparency]]/[[opacity (optics)|opacity]], including varieties that glow in the dark or have internal [[glitter]]; peg boards come in various shapes and several geometric patterns. Plastic toy beads, made by chopping plastic tubes into short pieces, were introduced in 1958 by Munkplast AB in [[Munka-Ljungby]], Sweden. Known as [[Indian bead]]s, they were originally sewn together to form ribbons. The pegboard for bead designs was invented in the early 1960s (patented 1962, patent granted 1967) by Gunnar Knutsson in V\u00e4llingby, Sweden, as a therapy for elderly homes; the pegboard later gained popularity as a toy for children.<ref>[http://was.prv.se/spd/search?content=SE+217875&lang=en&tab=1&hits=true Swedish patent 217875: S\u00e4tt att f\u00f6r arbetsterapi e.d. framst\u00e4lla permanenta, m\u00f6nstrade skivor samt m\u00f6strad skiva framst\u00e4lld enligt s\u00e4ttet], applied April 24, 1962; granted July 6, 1967; published December 19, 1967.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2YdeOnMtPI|title=Danya's Perler beads 2014 (four year old)|last=Arun Jagatheesan|date=30 October 2014|accessdate=23 October 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The bead designs were glued to cardboard or [[Masonite]] boards and used as [[trivet]]s. Later, when the beads were made of [[polyethylene]], it became possible to fuse them with a flat iron. Hama come in three sizes: mini (diameter 2.5&nbsp;mm), midi (5&nbsp;mm) and maxi (10&nbsp;mm). Perler beads come in two sizes called classic (5&nbsp;mm) and biggie (10&nbsp;mm). Pyssla beads (by [[IKEA]]) only come in one size (5&nbsp;mm).\n\n==Manufacturing==\nModern [[mass production|mass-produced]] beads are generally shaped by [[carving]] or [[casting]], depending on the material and desired effect. In some cases, more specialized [[metalworking]] or [[glass]]working techniques may be employed, or a combination of multiple techniques and materials may be used such as in [[cloisonn\u00e9]].\n\n=== Glassworking ===\n[[Image:Pressedglass.jpg|thumb|right|Pressed glass beads (matte finish with an AB coating)]]\n[[File:Assorted beads in a box 23June2019 arp.jpg|thumb|left|A box of assorted beads]]\nMost glass beads are [[pressed glass]], mass-produced by preparing a molten batch of [[Glass coloring and color marking|glass of the desired color]] and pouring it into molds to form the desired shape. This is also true of most [[plastic]] beads.\n\nA smaller and more expensive subset of glass and lead crystal beads are cut into precise faceted shapes on an individual basis. This was once done by hand but has largely been taken over by precision machinery.\n\n\"Fire-polished\" faceted beads are a less expensive alternative to hand-cut faceted glass or crystal. They derive their name from the second half of a two-part process: first, the glass batch is poured into round bead molds, then they are faceted with a grinding wheel. The faceted beads are then poured onto a tray and briefly reheated just long enough to melt the surface, \"polishing\" out any minor surface irregularities from the grinding wheel.\n\n==== Specialized glass techniques and types ====\n[[Image:Dichroicclose.jpg|thumb|upright|Dichroic beads ({{convert|10|mm}})]]\n[[Image:Furnaceglass.jpg|thumb|Furnace glass beads]]\nThere are several specialized glassworking techniques that create a distinctive appearance throughout the body of the resulting beads, which are then primarily referred to by the glass type.\n\nIf the glass batch is used to create a large massive block instead of pre-shaping it as it cools, the result may then be carved into smaller items in the same manner as stone. Conversely, glass artisans may make beads by [[lampworking]] the glass on an individual basis; once formed, the beads undergo little or no further shaping after the layers have been properly [[annealing (glass)|anneal]]ed.\n\nMost of these glass subtypes are some form of [[fused glass]], although [[Goldstone (gemstone)|goldstone]] is created by controlling the reductive atmosphere and cooling conditions of the glass batch rather than by fusing separate components together.\n\n[[Dichroic glass]] beads incorporate a semitransparent microlayer of metal between two or more layers. [[Fibre optic]] glass beads have an eyecatching [[chatoyant]] effect across the grain.\n\nThere are also several ways to fuse many small glass canes together into a multicolored pattern, resulting in [[millefiori]] beads or [[chevron bead]]s (sometimes called \"trade beads\"). \"Furnace glass\" beads encase a multicolored core in a transparent exterior layer which is then annealed in a furnace.\n\nMore economically, millefiori beads can also be made by limiting the patterning process to long, narrow canes or rods known as murrine. Thin cross-sections, or \"decals\", can then be cut from the murrine and fused into the surface of a plain glass bead.\n\n== Shapes ==\n\n'''Round'''\n\nThis is the most common shape of beads that are strung on wire to create necklaces, and bracelets. The shape of the round beads lay together and are pleasing to the eye. Rounds beads can be made of glass, stone, ceramic, metal, or wood.\n\n'''Square or Cubed'''\n\nSquare beads can be to enhance a necklace design as a spacer however a necklace can be strung with just square beads. The necklaces with square beads are used in [[Rosary]] necklaces/prayer necklaces, and wooden or shell ones are made for beachwear.\n\n'''Oval'''\n\n'''Tube'''\n\n'''Potato'''\n'''Hair pipe beads'''\nElk rib bones were the original material for the long, tubular [[hair pipe]] beads.<ref>Dubin 43, 44</ref> Today these beads are commonly made of [[bison]] and [[water buffalo]] bones and are popular for breastplates and chokers among [[Plains Indians]]. Black variations of these beads are made from the animals' horns.\n\n'''Seed beads'''\n{{Main|Seed bead}}\nSeed beads are uniformly shaped spheroidal or tube shaped beads ranging in size from under a millimetre to several millimetres. \"Seed bead\" is a generic term for any small bead. Usually rounded in shape, seed beads are most commonly used for [[Bead weaving|loom]] and [[Bead weaving|off-loom]] bead weaving.\n\n== Place or period of origin ==\n[[Image:Cinnabarbead.jpg|thumb|right|Carved [[Cinnabar]] [[lacquer]] beads]]\n'''African trade beads''' or '''[[slave beads]]''' may be antique beads that were manufactured in Europe and used for trade during the colonial period, such as chevron beads; or they may have been made in West Africa by and for Africans, such as Mauritanian [[Kiffa beads]], Ghanaian and Nigerian [[powder glass beads]], or African-made brass beads.\n\n'''Austrian crystal''' is a generic term for cut lead-crystal beads, based on the location and prestige of the [[Swarovski]] firm.\n\n'''Czech glass''' beads are made in the [[Czech Republic]], in particular an area called [[Jablonec nad Nisou]]. Production of glass beads in the area dates back to the 14th century, though production was depressed under communist rule. Because of this long tradition, their workmanship and quality has an excellent reputation.\n\n'''Vintage beads''', in the collectibles and antique market, refers to items that are at least 25 or more years old. Vintage beads are available in materials that include lucite, plastic, crystal, metal and glass.\n\n=== Miscellaneous ethnic beads ===\n[[Tibet]]an [[Dzi bead]]s and [[Rudraksha bead]]s are used to make Buddhist and Hindu rosaries ([[Prayer beads|malas]]). [[Magatama]] are traditional [[Japan]]ese beads, and [[cinnabar]] was often used for making beads<!--It would be good to add the name of these beads.--> in [[China]]. [[Wampum]] are cylindrical white or purple beads made from [[quahog]] or North Atlantic [[channeled whelk]] shells by northeastern Native American tribes, such as the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] and [[Shinnecock Indian Nation|Shinnecock]].<ref>Dubin, 170-171</ref> [[Job's tears]] are seed beads popular among southeastern Native American tribes. [[Heishe]] are beads made of shells or stones by the [[Kewa Pueblo, New Mexico|Kewa Pueblo people]] of [[New Mexico]].\n[[File:Pomegranate carved in the round MET DP110584.jpg|thumb|[[Pomegranate carved in the round|Bead, depicting a pomegranate]], dated to the [[Assyrian Empire]] of the 8th-century.]]\n\n==Symbolic meaning of beads==\nIn many parts of the world, beads are used for symbolic purposes, for example:\n* [[Prayer beads|use for prayer or devotion]] - e.g. [[rosary beads]] for Roman Catholics, [[misbaha]] for Muslims, [[japamala]]/[[Buddhist prayer beads]]/nenju for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, some Sikhs, [[Confucianism]], [[Tao]]ists/[[Dao]]ists, [[Shinto]], etc.\n* use for anti-tension devices, e.g. [[worry beads]]\n* use as currency e.g. [[Aggrey beads]] from [[Ghana]]\n* use for gaming e.g. [[owari beads]] for [[mankala]]\n* Greek [[komboloi]] beads as in [[Crete]]\n\n==History==\nBeads are thought to be one of the earliest forms of trade between members of the human race.

Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism, and yet this precise inability is what makes silicon less susceptible to bond with all sorts of impurities from which carbon, in comparison, is not shielded. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.<ref name=\"Pace\"/> Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as \"monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules\".<ref name=\"Pace\"/> This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double-bonded carbon is part of the [[carbonyl]] group, a fundamental motif of carbon-based bio-organic chemistry).\n\n[[Silanes]], which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable.

Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in Earth's crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets.

This complexity offers a large number of pathways for evolution to produce life, many other solvents{{which|date=November 2018}} have dramatically fewer possible reactions, which severely limits evolution.\n* Thermodynamic stability:  the free energy of formation of liquid water is low enough (\u2212237.24 kJ/mol) that water undergoes few reactions.  Other solvents are highly reactive, particularly with oxygen.\n* Water does not combust in oxygen because it is already the combustion product of hydrogen with oxygen.

Cryogenic liquids (such as liquid methane) have exponentially lower transition state populations which are needed for life based on chemical reactions. This leads to chemical reaction rates which may be so slow as to preclude the development of any life based on chemical reactions.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n* Spectroscopic transparency allowing solar radiation to penetrate several meters into the liquid (or solid), greatly aiding the evolution of aquatic life.\n* A large [[heat of vaporization]] leading to stable lakes and oceans.\n* The ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds.\n* The solid (ice) has lower density than the liquid, so ice floats on the liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.\n\nWater as a compound is cosmically abundant, although much of it is in the form of vapour or ice. Subsurface liquid water is considered likely or possible on several of the outer moons: [[Enceladus]] (where geysers have been observed), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Earth and Titan are the only worlds currently known to have stable bodies of liquid on their surfaces.\n\nNot all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however.<ref name=\"barosswater\">Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=70 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 70.</ref> For instance, water ice has a high [[albedo]],<ref name=\"barosswater\"/> meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During [[ice age]]s, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.<ref name=\"barosswater\"/>\n\nThere are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid-phase temperature range at 1&nbsp;atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|atm}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.\n\n====Ammonia====\n[[File:Ammonia World.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Artist's conception of how a planet with ammonia-based life might look]]\nThe [[ammonia]] molecule (NH<sub>3</sub>), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen.<ref name=\"asimov\"/> The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when [[J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S.

Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related [[amine]] group (\u2212NH<sub>2</sub>) is analogous to the water-related [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2212OH).<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H<sup>+</sup> ion. When ammonia accepts an H<sup>+</sup>, it forms the [[ammonium]] cation (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), analogous to [[hydronium]] (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). When it donates an H<sup>+</sup> ion, it forms the [[metal amides|amide]] anion (NH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>), analogous to the [[hydroxide]] anion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H<sup>+</sup> ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger [[nucleophile]].<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Ammonia added to water functions as [[Arrhenius base]]: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a [[Acid-base reaction#Solvent system definition|solvent system definition]] of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium.<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/> The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous [[imine]] group (C=NH) could be used instead.<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nHowever, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's [[heat of vaporization]] to be half that of water, its [[surface tension]] to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a [[hydrophobic]] effect. Gerald Feinberg and [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] have questioned whether ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together well enough to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life Beyond Earth |url=https://archive.org/details/lifebeyondearthi0000fein |url-access=registration |first=Gerald |last= Feinberg |author2=Robert Shapiro |publisher=Morrow |date=1980 |isbn=9780688036423}} cited in {{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html/ | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018095038/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html | archivedate = 2012-10-18 }}</ref> Ammonia is also flammable in oxygen and could not exist sustainably in an environment suitable for [[aerobic metabolism]].<ref name=\"dsmammonia\">{{cite book |title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints |first=Dirk |last= Schulze-Makuch |first2=Louis Neal |last2=Irwin |publisher=Springer |edition=2 |date=2008 |isbn= 9783540768166 |page=119}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Layers of titan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Titan's theorized internal structure, subsurface ocean shown in blue]]\nA [[biosphere]] based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual in relation to life on Earth.

Chemical reactions generally proceed more slowly at a lower temperature. Therefore, ammonia-based life, if it exists, might metabolize more slowly and evolve more slowly than life on Earth.<ref name=\"dsmammonia\"/> On the other hand, lower temperatures could also enable living systems to use chemical species that would be too unstable at Earth temperatures to be useful.<ref name=\"asimov\"/>\n\nAmmonia could be a liquid at Earth-like temperatures, but at much higher pressures; for example, at 60&nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], ammonia melts at \u221277&nbsp;\u00b0C (196&nbsp;K) and boils at 98&nbsp;\u00b0C (371&nbsp;K).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia and ammonia\u2013water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based [[habitability zone]].

Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism, and yet this precise inability is what makes silicon less susceptible to bond with all sorts of impurities from which carbon, in comparison, is not shielded. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.<ref name=\"Pace\"/> Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as \"monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules\".<ref name=\"Pace\"/> This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double-bonded carbon is part of the [[carbonyl]] group, a fundamental motif of carbon-based bio-organic chemistry).\n\n[[Silanes]], which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable.

Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in Earth's crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets.

This complexity offers a large number of pathways for evolution to produce life, many other solvents{{which|date=November 2018}} have dramatically fewer possible reactions, which severely limits evolution.\n* Thermodynamic stability:  the free energy of formation of liquid water is low enough (\u2212237.24 kJ/mol) that water undergoes few reactions.  Other solvents are highly reactive, particularly with oxygen.\n* Water does not combust in oxygen because it is already the combustion product of hydrogen with oxygen. Most alternative solvents are not stable in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, so it is highly unlikely that those liquids could support aerobic life.\n* A large temperature range over which it is [[liquid phase|liquid]].\n* High solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide at room temperature supporting the evolution of aerobic aquatic plant and animal life.\n* A high [[heat capacity]] (leading to higher environmental temperature stability).\n* Water is a room-temperature liquid leading to a large population of quantum transition states required to overcome reaction barriers. Cryogenic liquids (such as liquid methane) have exponentially lower transition state populations which are needed for life based on chemical reactions. This leads to chemical reaction rates which may be so slow as to preclude the development of any life based on chemical reactions.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n* Spectroscopic transparency allowing solar radiation to penetrate several meters into the liquid (or solid), greatly aiding the evolution of aquatic life.\n* A large [[heat of vaporization]] leading to stable lakes and oceans.\n* The ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds.\n* The solid (ice) has lower density than the liquid, so ice floats on the liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.\n\nWater as a compound is cosmically abundant, although much of it is in the form of vapour or ice. Subsurface liquid water is considered likely or possible on several of the outer moons: [[Enceladus]] (where geysers have been observed), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Earth and Titan are the only worlds currently known to have stable bodies of liquid on their surfaces.\n\nNot all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however.<ref name=\"barosswater\">Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=70 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 70.</ref> For instance, water ice has a high [[albedo]],<ref name=\"barosswater\"/> meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During [[ice age]]s, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.<ref name=\"barosswater\"/>\n\nThere are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid-phase temperature range at 1&nbsp;atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|atm}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.\n\n====Ammonia====\n[[File:Ammonia World.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Artist's conception of how a planet with ammonia-based life might look]]\nThe [[ammonia]] molecule (NH<sub>3</sub>), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen.<ref name=\"asimov\"/> The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when [[J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S. Haldane]] raised the topic at a symposium about life's origin.<ref name=\"haldane\">{{Cite journal |author=J. B. S.

Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related [[amine]] group (\u2212NH<sub>2</sub>) is analogous to the water-related [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2212OH).<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H<sup>+</sup> ion. When ammonia accepts an H<sup>+</sup>, it forms the [[ammonium]] cation (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), analogous to [[hydronium]] (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). When it donates an H<sup>+</sup> ion, it forms the [[metal amides|amide]] anion (NH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>), analogous to the [[hydroxide]] anion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H<sup>+</sup> ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger [[nucleophile]].<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Ammonia added to water functions as [[Arrhenius base]]: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a [[Acid-base reaction#Solvent system definition|solvent system definition]] of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium.<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/> The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous [[imine]] group (C=NH) could be used instead.<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nHowever, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's [[heat of vaporization]] to be half that of water, its [[surface tension]] to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a [[hydrophobic]] effect. Gerald Feinberg and [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] have questioned whether ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together well enough to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life Beyond Earth |url=https://archive.org/details/lifebeyondearthi0000fein |url-access=registration |first=Gerald |last= Feinberg |author2=Robert Shapiro |publisher=Morrow |date=1980 |isbn=9780688036423}} cited in {{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html/ | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018095038/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html | archivedate = 2012-10-18 }}</ref> Ammonia is also flammable in oxygen and could not exist sustainably in an environment suitable for [[aerobic metabolism]].<ref name=\"dsmammonia\">{{cite book |title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints |first=Dirk |last= Schulze-Makuch |first2=Louis Neal |last2=Irwin |publisher=Springer |edition=2 |date=2008 |isbn= 9783540768166 |page=119}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Layers of titan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Titan's theorized internal structure, subsurface ocean shown in blue]]\nA [[biosphere]] based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual in relation to life on Earth. Life on Earth usually exists within the melting point and [[boiling point]] of water at [[normal pressure]], between 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (273&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) and 100&nbsp;\u00b0C (373&nbsp;K); at normal pressure ammonia's melting and boiling points are between \u221278&nbsp;\u00b0C (195&nbsp;K) and \u221233&nbsp;\u00b0C (240&nbsp;K). Chemical reactions generally proceed more slowly at a lower temperature. Therefore, ammonia-based life, if it exists, might metabolize more slowly and evolve more slowly than life on Earth.<ref name=\"dsmammonia\"/> On the other hand, lower temperatures could also enable living systems to use chemical species that would be too unstable at Earth temperatures to be useful.<ref name=\"asimov\"/>\n\nAmmonia could be a liquid at Earth-like temperatures, but at much higher pressures; for example, at 60&nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], ammonia melts at \u221277&nbsp;\u00b0C (196&nbsp;K) and boils at 98&nbsp;\u00b0C (371&nbsp;K).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia and ammonia\u2013water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based [[habitability zone]].

At its peak, US&nbsp;80 traveled from the [[California]] border in [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] to the [[New Mexico]] state line near [[Lordsburg, New Mexico|Lordsburg]]. US&nbsp;80 was an important highway in the development of Arizona's car culture. Like its northern counterpart, [[U.S. Route 66 in Arizona|US&nbsp;66]], the popularity of travel along US&nbsp;80 helped lead to the establishment of many unique road side businesses and attractions, including many iconic motor hotels and restaurants. US&nbsp;80 was a particularly long highway, reaching a length of almost {{convert|500|mi|km}} within the state of Arizona alone for most of the route's existence.\n\nAlong with US&nbsp;66, US&nbsp;80 was one of the first [[United States Numbered Highway System|U.S. Highways]] to span Arizona. Where US&nbsp;66 served northern Arizona, US&nbsp;80 acted the main interstate highway for the southern half of the state, serving the major cities of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona]], along with other small towns and cities. The condition of the highway was modernized and improved during the [[Great Depression]], largely through manual labor and funding provided by the [[Works Progress Administration]], which included the grade separation of railroad crossings and paving of the highway. Tourism and traffic along US&nbsp;80 greatly increased following the end of [[World War II]], creating a temporary economic boom for businesses along the highway. Several areas of the highway were also bypassed or straightened during this time to help alleviate the increasing traffic.\n\nDue to the creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1956, both [[Interstate 10]] and [[Interstate 8]] gradually replaced US&nbsp;80 as a major highway. Many towns and communties along the highway fell into an economic decline after Interstate bypasses caused a decrease in tourism and patronage. Since US&nbsp;80 was largely concurrent or bypassed by Interstate Highways across Arizona, the older U.S. Highway was seen as a redundant designation. The US&nbsp;80 designation was removed from Arizona between 1977 and 1989. The remaining stand-alone sections of US&nbsp;80 in Arizona, not concurrent with other highways, were re-designated as [[Arizona State Route 80|State Route 80]], a northern extension of [[Arizona State Route 85|SR&nbsp;85]] and various Interstate business loops. In September 2018, the [[Arizona Department of Transportation]] designated many surviving segments of the former highway as '''Historic U.S. Route 80''', making it the fourth state-recognized historic route in Arizona's history.\n\n==Route description==\nWithin the state of Arizona, US&nbsp;80 made two indirect loops to both [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Douglas, Arizona|Douglas]]. Both loops were often bypassed by travelers, using the more direct routes of [[Arizona State Route 84|SR&nbsp;84]] and [[Arizona State Route 86|SR&nbsp;86]] respectively to decrease travel time between California and New Mexico.<ref name=\"PHXMag\" /> The odd shape created by the two \"loops\" gave US&nbsp;80 a long length through the state of Arizona, which was around {{convert|500|mi|km}} in total. In 1935, US&nbsp;80 was {{convert|500.5|mi|km}} long.<ref name=\"AARoadsMap1935\" /> By 1951, the total length had reduced to about {{convert|498|mi|km}}, shrinking further to {{convert|488|mi|km}} in 1956 with the bypass of Arlington and the Gillespie Dam.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey01\" /> The following route description roughly describes the path of US&nbsp;80 as it would have been in 1951.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" />\n\n===Yuma to Phoenix===\n[[File:Ocean to Ocean Bridge, Yuma, AZ.jpg|thumb|left|The 1914 [[Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge]] in Yuma]]\nNorth of the 1914 [[Ocean to Ocean Bridge|Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge]], the state border between [[California]] and Arizona briefly exits the [[Colorado River]] and makes its way through the [[Fort Yuma Indian Reservation]], placing several acres of land on the California side of the river in [[Yuma County, Arizona]]. It is at this land border that US&nbsp;80 entered Arizona on present-day Quechan Road in front of a now-abandoned [[California Department of Food and Agriculture#Agriculture inspection stations|Agricultural Inspection Station]]. The highway turned to head south across the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge, entering [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] on Penitentiary Avenue. Penitentiary curves west at the remains of [[Yuma Territorial Prison]], becoming 1st Street, passing the downtown district of Yuma. The historic Hotel San Carlos, now an apartment building, is located at the curve where Penitentiary becomes 1st.<ref name=\"Jensen\">{{cite book |title=Drive the Broadway of America! |publisher=Bygone Byways |last=Jensen |first= Jeff |year=2013 |location=Tucson |isbn=9780978625900}}</ref>\n\nA few blocks west at 4th Avenue, US&nbsp;80 had its first major highway junction in Arizona with [[Arizona State Route 95|State Route&nbsp;95]], which came in from the west on 1st Street.

Past South Avenue 8\u00bd East, [[Interstate 8|I-8]] takes over the route of US&nbsp;80, save for a small area near Exit&nbsp;14, where US&nbsp;80 followed the South [[Frontage Road]] for less than a mile. US&nbsp;80 mostly followed the route taken by the I-8 westbound lanes over Telegraph Pass, before splitting off onto East Highway 80 through [[Ligurta, Arizona|Ligurta]]. The highway then used an underpass to clear the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]] mainline (now part of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]), paralleling the tracks east into [[Wellton, Arizona|Wellton]] and becoming Los Angeles Avenue through town.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\nEast of Wellton, US&nbsp;80 continued to parallel the Southern Pacific into Mohawk Pass, where it once again took on the route of I-8, then continued straight ahead onto Old Highway 80 into the town of [[Dateland, Arizona|Dateland]], iconic for its large [[date palm]] [[orchard]]. The highway continued east from Dateland on what is now the south frontage road of I-8. Around Tenmile Wash was where the small highway and railroad town of [[Aztec, Arizona|Aztec]] once stood. Today, all that remains of Aztec is an isolated water tower between old US&nbsp;80 and the tracks. Past Aztec, US&nbsp;80 used the eastbound lanes of I-8 crossing the [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] line before heading through [[Sentinel, Arizona|Sentinel]].

Today Pima Street acts as both [[Business routes of Interstate 8#Gila Bend loop|I-8 Business]] and [[Arizona State Route 85|SR&nbsp;85]]. The intersection of Martin Avenue and Pima Street served as the northern terminus of SR&nbsp;85, which itself has since replaced US&nbsp;80 to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Gila Bend is home to the iconic 1961 vintage Space Age Lodge, a motel with an [[outer space]] theme sporting a fake alien spaceship on its roof.

The rest of the I-8 Business loop east of this point was formerly [[Arizona State Route 84|SR&nbsp;84]] to [[Casa Grande, Arizona|Casa Grande]]. The old highway parallels the Gila Bend Canal through [[Cotton Center, Arizona|Cotton Center]] and crossed over an old concrete bridge (now destroyed with only one span left standing) then curved northwest, arriving at the eastern bank of the [[Gila River]] near the ruins of the [[Gillespie Dam]].<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\n[[File:AZ State Capitol Building 80566.JPG|thumb|right|Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix]]\nUS&nbsp;80 crossed the 1927 [[Gillespie Dam Bridge]] over the Gila River, where it immediately turned north on the other side of the river. After heading north a short distance, the highway turned northeast near [[Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station]] and passed through [[Arlington, Arizona|Arlington]]. East of Arlington, US&nbsp;80 then before turned east, crossing over the [[Hassayampa River]] into the town of Hassayampa. At Wilson Road, US&nbsp;80 turned north, then east onto Hazen Road. At SR&nbsp;85, the highway traveled north to the next major intersection with MC&nbsp;85, then curved east into the town of [[Buckeye, Arizona|Buckeye]] as Monroe Avenue. Buckeye marks the western end of the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] metropolitan area. Heading east from Buckeye, US&nbsp;80 used both MC&nbsp;85 and Buckeye Road, through the Phoenix suburbs of [[Goodyear, Arizona|Goodyear]] and [[Avondale, Arizona|Avondale]]. East of Avondale and present-day [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]], US&nbsp;80 entered Phoenix proper. At 17th Avenue, US&nbsp;80 left Buckeye Road, heading north past the [[Arizona State Capitol]] to Van Buren Street. At Van Buren, the highway headed east again to an intersection with 7th Avenue and Grand Avenue, where it met [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US&nbsp;60]], [[U.S. Route 70 in Arizona|US&nbsp;70]] and [[U.S. Route 89 in Arizona|US&nbsp;89]].

US&nbsp;80, US&nbsp;89 and SR&nbsp;84 continued on Stone Avenue through downtown to the Five Points intersection at 18th Street and 6th Avenue, where Stone ended. The highways from this point used 6th Avenue to continue south through the enclave of [[South Tucson, Arizona|South Tucson]], passing a few more historic 1930s era motels. Sixth Avenue met Benson Highway at an intersection just north of the Southern Arizona Veterans Affairs Hospital. Today, this part of Benson Highway is now [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]]. SR&nbsp;84 ended at this intersection, while US&nbsp;89 continued south on 6th Avenue to [[Tubac, Arizona|Tubac]] and [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]].

Near Vail, US&nbsp;80 diverged from I-10 onto the north frontage road, crossing a decorative wash bridge. Going south of Vail past the northern terminus of [[Arizona State Route 83|SR&nbsp;83]], US&nbsp;80 went northeast through small foothills on Marsh Station Road, crossing [[Ci\u00e9nega Creek]] over the historic 1921 [[Ci\u00e9nega Bridge]]. The highway then arrived in the small town of [[Pantano, Arizona|Pantano]]. Today, Pantano is a [[ghost town]], with few structures still standing. US&nbsp;80 continued southeast on Marsh Station Road, returning to the routing of I-10, then crossed the [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] line. Just across the county line, US&nbsp;80 made a small curve onto Titan Drive, crossing under the now-abandoned [[El Paso and Southwestern Railroad]] before returning once again to the route of I-10. Arriving in [[Benson, Arizona|Benson]], US&nbsp;80 headed east onto 4th Street (now [[Business routes of Interstate 10#Benson business loop|I-10 Business]]) through the town center. US&nbsp;80 met the western terminus of the eastern section of [[Arizona State Route 86|SR&nbsp;86]] at a 1941 interchange/underpass complex. SR&nbsp;86 continued east on I-10 Business and I-10 towards [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]] and New Mexico, while US&nbsp;80 turned south on what is now [[Arizona State Route 80|SR&nbsp;80]].

At its peak, US&nbsp;80 traveled from the [[California]] border in [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] to the [[New Mexico]] state line near [[Lordsburg, New Mexico|Lordsburg]]. US&nbsp;80 was an important highway in the development of Arizona's car culture. Like its northern counterpart, [[U.S. Route 66 in Arizona|US&nbsp;66]], the popularity of travel along US&nbsp;80 helped lead to the establishment of many unique road side businesses and attractions, including many iconic motor hotels and restaurants. US&nbsp;80 was a particularly long highway, reaching a length of almost {{convert|500|mi|km}} within the state of Arizona alone for most of the route's existence.\n\nAlong with US&nbsp;66, US&nbsp;80 was one of the first [[United States Numbered Highway System|U.S. Highways]] to span Arizona. Where US&nbsp;66 served northern Arizona, US&nbsp;80 acted the main interstate highway for the southern half of the state, serving the major cities of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona]], along with other small towns and cities. The condition of the highway was modernized and improved during the [[Great Depression]], largely through manual labor and funding provided by the [[Works Progress Administration]], which included the grade separation of railroad crossings and paving of the highway. Tourism and traffic along US&nbsp;80 greatly increased following the end of [[World War II]], creating a temporary economic boom for businesses along the highway. Several areas of the highway were also bypassed or straightened during this time to help alleviate the increasing traffic.\n\nDue to the creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1956, both [[Interstate 10]] and [[Interstate 8]] gradually replaced US&nbsp;80 as a major highway. Many towns and communties along the highway fell into an economic decline after Interstate bypasses caused a decrease in tourism and patronage. Since US&nbsp;80 was largely concurrent or bypassed by Interstate Highways across Arizona, the older U.S. Highway was seen as a redundant designation. The US&nbsp;80 designation was removed from Arizona between 1977 and 1989. The remaining stand-alone sections of US&nbsp;80 in Arizona, not concurrent with other highways, were re-designated as [[Arizona State Route 80|State Route 80]], a northern extension of [[Arizona State Route 85|SR&nbsp;85]] and various Interstate business loops. In September 2018, the [[Arizona Department of Transportation]] designated many surviving segments of the former highway as '''Historic U.S. Route 80''', making it the fourth state-recognized historic route in Arizona's history.\n\n==Route description==\nWithin the state of Arizona, US&nbsp;80 made two indirect loops to both [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Douglas, Arizona|Douglas]]. Both loops were often bypassed by travelers, using the more direct routes of [[Arizona State Route 84|SR&nbsp;84]] and [[Arizona State Route 86|SR&nbsp;86]] respectively to decrease travel time between California and New Mexico.<ref name=\"PHXMag\" /> The odd shape created by the two \"loops\" gave US&nbsp;80 a long length through the state of Arizona, which was around {{convert|500|mi|km}} in total. In 1935, US&nbsp;80 was {{convert|500.5|mi|km}} long.<ref name=\"AARoadsMap1935\" /> By 1951, the total length had reduced to about {{convert|498|mi|km}}, shrinking further to {{convert|488|mi|km}} in 1956 with the bypass of Arlington and the Gillespie Dam.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey01\" /> The following route description roughly describes the path of US&nbsp;80 as it would have been in 1951.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" />\n\n===Yuma to Phoenix===\n[[File:Ocean to Ocean Bridge, Yuma, AZ.jpg|thumb|left|The 1914 [[Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge]] in Yuma]]\nNorth of the 1914 [[Ocean To Ocean Bridge|Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge]], the state border between [[California]] and Arizona briefly exits the [[Colorado River]] and makes its way through the [[Fort Yuma Indian Reservation]], placing several acres of land on the California side of the river in [[Yuma County, Arizona]]. It is at this land border that US&nbsp;80 entered Arizona on present-day Quechan Road in front of a now-abandoned [[California Department of Food and Agriculture#Agriculture inspection stations|Agricultural Inspection Station]]. The highway turned to head south across the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge, entering [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] on Penitentiary Avenue. Penitentiary curves west at the remains of [[Yuma Territorial Prison]], becoming 1st Street, passing the downtown district of Yuma. The historic Hotel San Carlos, now an apartment building, is located at the curve where Penitentiary becomes 1st.<ref name=\"Jensen\">{{cite book |title=Drive the Broadway of America! |publisher=Bygone Byways |last=Jensen |first= Jeff |year=2013 |location=Tucson |isbn=9780978625900}}</ref>\n\nA few blocks west at 4th Avenue, US&nbsp;80 had its first major highway junction in Arizona with [[Arizona State Route 95|State Route&nbsp;95]], which came in from the west on 1st Street. Both US&nbsp;80 and SR&nbsp;95 turned south joining the route of present-day [[Business routes of Interstate 8#Winterhaven\u2013Yuma loop|I-8 Business]], sharing a [[Concurrency (road)#Wrong-way concurrencies|wrong-way concurrency]]. At 16th Street, SR&nbsp;95 split off and headed east towards [[Quartzsite, Arizona|Quartzsite]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/118377134/ |title=Notice of Public Hearing |date=June 24, 1958 |work=Arizona Republic |access-date=August 1, 2019 |page=2 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Today, 16th Street carries [[U.S. Route 95 in Arizona|US&nbsp;95]], the successor to SR&nbsp;95. At 32nd Street, US&nbsp;80 curved east, skirting the north end of [[Yuma International Airport]]. Past South Avenue 8\u00bd East, [[Interstate 8|I-8]] takes over the route of US&nbsp;80, save for a small area near Exit&nbsp;14, where US&nbsp;80 followed the South [[Frontage Road]] for less than a mile. US&nbsp;80 mostly followed the route taken by the I-8 westbound lanes over Telegraph Pass, before splitting off onto East Highway 80 through [[Ligurta, Arizona|Ligurta]]. The highway then used an underpass to clear the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]] mainline (now part of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]), paralleling the tracks east into [[Wellton, Arizona|Wellton]] and becoming Los Angeles Avenue through town.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\nEast of Wellton, US&nbsp;80 continued to parallel the Southern Pacific into Mohawk Pass, where it once again took on the route of I-8, then continued straight ahead onto Old Highway 80 into the town of [[Dateland, Arizona|Dateland]], iconic for its large [[date palm]] [[orchard]]. The highway continued east from Dateland on what is now the south frontage road of I-8. Around Tenmile Wash was where the small highway and railroad town of [[Aztec, Arizona|Aztec]] once stood. Today, all that remains of Aztec is an isolated water tower between old US&nbsp;80 and the tracks. Past Aztec, US&nbsp;80 used the eastbound lanes of I-8 crossing the [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] line before heading through [[Sentinel, Arizona|Sentinel]]. Sentinel was a common stop for highway travelers using US&nbsp;80, being home to a gas station. Today, a different gas station at Sentinel serves I-8 travelers.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\n[[File:Old US 80 Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The 1927 [[Gillespie Dam Bridge]]]]\nUS&nbsp;80 then continued onto the south frontage road from [[Piedra, Arizona|Piedra]] through [[Theba, Arizona|Theba]] and [[Smurr, Arizona|Smurr]] before finally reaching [[Gila Bend, Arizona|Gila Bend]], becoming Pima Street. Today Pima Street acts as both [[Business routes of Interstate 8#Gila Bend loop|I-8 Business]] and [[Arizona State Route 85|SR&nbsp;85]]. The intersection of Martin Avenue and Pima Street served as the northern terminus of SR&nbsp;85, which itself has since replaced US&nbsp;80 to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Gila Bend is home to the iconic 1961 vintage Space Age Lodge, a motel with an [[outer space]] theme sporting a fake alien spaceship on its roof. The oldest remaining building in Gila Bend, the former Stout Hotel, is also located on former US&nbsp;80 in town.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" /> US&nbsp;80 turned north towards Phoenix, leaving Pima Street at Old Highway&nbsp;80. The rest of the I-8 Business loop east of this point was formerly [[Arizona State Route 84|SR&nbsp;84]] to [[Casa Grande, Arizona|Casa Grande]]. The old highway parallels the Gila Bend Canal through [[Cotton Center, Arizona|Cotton Center]] and crossed over an old concrete bridge (now destroyed with only one span left standing) then curved northwest, arriving at the eastern bank of the [[Gila River]] near the ruins of the [[Gillespie Dam]].<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\n[[File:AZ State Capitol Building 80566.JPG|thumb|right|Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix]]\nUS&nbsp;80 crossed the 1927 [[Gillespie Dam Bridge]] over the Gila River, where it immediately turned north on the other side of the river. After heading north a short distance, the highway turned northeast near [[Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station]] and passed through [[Arlington, Arizona|Arlington]]. East of Arlington, US&nbsp;80 then before turned east, crossing over the [[Hassayampa River]] into the town of Hassayampa. At Wilson Road, US&nbsp;80 turned north, then east onto Hazen Road. At SR&nbsp;85, the highway traveled north to the next major intersection with MC&nbsp;85, then curved east into the town of [[Buckeye, Arizona|Buckeye]] as Monroe Avenue. Buckeye marks the western end of the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] metropolitan area. Heading east from Buckeye, US&nbsp;80 used both MC&nbsp;85 and Buckeye Road, through the Phoenix suburbs of [[Goodyear, Arizona|Goodyear]] and [[Avondale, Arizona|Avondale]]. East of Avondale and present-day [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]], US&nbsp;80 entered Phoenix proper. At 17th Avenue, US&nbsp;80 left Buckeye Road, heading north past the [[Arizona State Capitol]] to Van Buren Street. At Van Buren, the highway headed east again to an intersection with 7th Avenue and Grand Avenue, where it met [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US&nbsp;60]], [[U.S. Route 70 in Arizona|US&nbsp;70]] and [[U.S. Route 89 in Arizona|US&nbsp;89]]. From Grand Avenue east, US&nbsp;80 shared a long concurrency with the other three U.S. Highways through the eastern half of the Phoenix area.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\n===Phoenix to Tucson===\n[[File:Historic US 80 and SR 77 in Tucson, Arizona.jpg|thumb|Historic US 80 sign on SR&nbsp;77 (Oracle Road) in Tucson]]\nPassing through downtown Phoenix on Van Buren Street, US&nbsp;60/US&nbsp;70/US&nbsp;80/US&nbsp;89 turned southwest where the [[Phoenix Zoo]] is today, arriving at an interchange with Washington Street (now Center Parkway). Washington Street was an unsigned [[bannered route]] of US&nbsp;80 known as [[Special routes of U.S. Route 80#Phoenix alternate routes|US&nbsp;80 Alternate]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.azdot.gov/files/ROW/Plans/County_Key_Maps/Maricopa_County.pdf |title=Washington Boulevard Alternate U.S. 80 - Arizona State Highway Department - Right of Way Maps - Maricopa County |last=Stanhagen |first=W.H. |website=Existing Right of Way Plans Index - Arizona Department of Transportation |publisher=Arizona State Highway Department |location=Phoenix |pages=33 to 38 |date=August 1939}}</ref> South of the intersection, the highways used the 1931 [[Mill Avenue Bridges|Mill Avenue Bridge]] to cross the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] into downtown [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]. At 13th Street, the four highways curved east, passing the [[Arizona State University]] main campus onto Apache Boulevard. Apache Boulevard becomes Main Street through downtown [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]]. This was where the quartet of U.S. Highways met [[Arizona State Route 87|SR&nbsp;87]]. In 1951, the junction with Main Street and SR&nbsp;87 was the northern terminus of the latter highway.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\nUS&nbsp;60/US&nbsp;70/US&nbsp;80/US&nbsp;89 continued east across the [[Pinal County, Arizona|Pinal County]] line onto the beginning of the Apache Trail into [[Apache Junction, Arizona|Apache Junction]]. Apache Trail split from the old highway, becoming [[Arizona State Route 88|SR&nbsp;88]] as it headed to [[Tortilla Flat, Arizona|Tortilla Flat]]. From the junction with SR&nbsp;88, US&nbsp;60/US&nbsp;70/US&nbsp;80/US&nbsp;89 angled southeast down Old West Highway and continued straight from Goldfield Road, becoming present day US&nbsp;60. The highways continued down the modern US&nbsp;60 past present day [[Gold Canyon, Arizona|Gold Canyon]] to [[Florence Junction, Arizona|Florence Junction]]. US&nbsp;60/US&nbsp;70/US&nbsp;80/US&nbsp;89 diverged from present day US&nbsp;60 north of the current [[diamond interchange]] with [[Arizona State Route 79|SR&nbsp;79]] (Exit&nbsp;212), taking El Camino Viejo east to an at-grade intersection with SR&nbsp;79. At this intersection, US&nbsp;60 and US&nbsp;70 diverged from US&nbsp;80 and US&nbsp;89. Running concurrently, US&nbsp;60 and US&nbsp;70 continued east on El Camino Viejo and present-day US&nbsp;60 towards [[Superior, Arizona|Superior]] and [[Globe, Arizona|Globe]]. US&nbsp;80 and US&nbsp;89 took SR&nbsp;79 south, crossing the Gila River a second time, into [[Florence, Arizona|Florence]].<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\n[[File:Frontier Motel.jpg|thumb|left|Neon signs for the Frontier Motel and [[Tucson Inn]] on [[Miracle Mile Historic District|Miracle Mile]]]]\nIn Florence, US&nbsp;80 and US&nbsp;89 split from SR&nbsp;79 at the state prison, going west on Ruggles Street, then south on Main Street through downtown. The junction with Main Street ([[Arizona State Route 79|SR&nbsp;79 Business]]) and [[Arizona State Route 287|SR&nbsp;287]] on the south side of town served as the eastern terminus of SR&nbsp;287 in 1951. From here, US&nbsp;80 and US&nbsp;89 went southeast on SR&nbsp;79 Business, returning to SR&nbsp;79. Just south of Florence on the side of the highway is a roadside memorial to [[Western (genre)|cowboy western]] actor [[Tom Mix]]. It was not far from this position in 1940 that Mix was killed when his car slid off US&nbsp;80/US&nbsp;89 into a small [[Arroyo (creek)|wash]]. US&nbsp;80/US&nbsp;89 continued south to [[Oracle Junction, Arizona|Arizona]] at the southern terminus of [[Arizona State Route 77|SR&nbsp;77]].<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\nUS&nbsp;80/US&nbsp;89 continued south on current SR&nbsp;77 across the [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] line where the highway becomes Oracle Road. Both highways passed through the town of [[Oro Valley, Arizona|Oro Valley]] on the western side of the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] before crossing the [[Rillito River|El Rillito]] river into [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. Where SR&nbsp;77 turns west onto [[Miracle Mile Historic District|Miracle Mile]] was where US&nbsp;80 and US&nbsp;89 met SR&nbsp;84.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" /> This intersection was formerly a large traffic circle. South of this point, Oracle Road was once part of Tucson's Miracle Mile District, a former bustling business district lined with historic motels and iconic structures. US&nbsp;80, US&nbsp;89 and SR&nbsp;84 continued south on Oracle Road, then east at another large traffic circle on to Drachman Street through the Miracle Mile District, passing the iconic [[Tucson Inn]] before reaching the end of the Miracle Mile at Stone Avenue.<ref name=\"Clinco01\" /><ref name=\"ADOTRes84\" />\n\nThe three highways proceeded to curve south onto Stone Avenue, passing the 1936 [[Art Deco]]-styled Old Pueblo Service Station before taking the [[Stone Avenue Underpass]], a decorative Gothic Style 1939 underpass, to cross the Southern Pacific Railroad into downtown. US&nbsp;80, US&nbsp;89 and SR&nbsp;84 continued on Stone Avenue through downtown to the Five Points intersection at 18th Street and 6th Avenue, where Stone ended. The highways from this point used 6th Avenue to continue south through the enclave of [[South Tucson, Arizona|South Tucson]], passing a few more historic 1930s era motels. Sixth Avenue met Benson Highway at an intersection just north of the Southern Arizona Veterans Affairs Hospital. Today, this part of Benson Highway is now [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]]. SR&nbsp;84 ended at this intersection, while US&nbsp;89 continued south on 6th Avenue to [[Tubac, Arizona|Tubac]] and [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]]. US&nbsp;80 turned east onto present-day I-10, passing the historic Old Spanish Trail Inn right before curving southeast onto Benson Highway.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" /><ref name=\"ADOTRes84\" /> Benson Highway has a row of neon-signed motels that stretch southeast out of Tucson towards [[Vail, Arizona|Vail]], including the iconic Spanish Trail Inn, which now stands partially abandoned. US&nbsp;80 then continued southeast on Benson Highway, exiting Tucson.<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\n===Tucson to the New Mexico state line===\n{{see also|Arizona State Route 80}}\nAt Valencia Road, US&nbsp;80 continued towards Vail along present-day I-10, passing the Triple T Truck Stop at Craycroft Road along the way. Near Vail, US&nbsp;80 diverged from I-10 onto the north frontage road, crossing a decorative wash bridge. Going south of Vail past the northern terminus of [[Arizona State Route 83|SR&nbsp;83]], US&nbsp;80 went northeast through small foothills on Marsh Station Road, crossing [[Ci\u00e9nega Creek]] over the historic 1921 [[Ci\u00e9nega Bridge]]. The highway then arrived in the small town of [[Pantano, Arizona|Pantano]]. Today, Pantano is a [[ghost town]], with few structures still standing. US&nbsp;80 continued southeast on Marsh Station Road, returning to the routing of I-10, then crossed the [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] line. Just across the county line, US&nbsp;80 made a small curve onto Titan Drive, crossing under the now-abandoned [[El Paso and Southwestern Railroad]] before returning once again to the route of I-10. Arriving in [[Benson, Arizona|Benson]], US&nbsp;80 headed east onto 4th Street (now [[Business routes of Interstate 10#Benson business loop|I-10 Business]]) through the town center. US&nbsp;80 met the western terminus of the eastern section of [[Arizona State Route 86|SR&nbsp;86]] at a 1941 interchange/underpass complex. SR&nbsp;86 continued east on I-10 Business and I-10 towards [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]] and New Mexico, while US&nbsp;80 turned south on what is now [[Arizona State Route 80|SR&nbsp;80]]. US&nbsp;80 then passed through [[St. David, Arizona|St. David]] as Patton Street and Lee Street, heading towards [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]].<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" /><ref name=\"Google\" />\n\n[[File:Allen Street Tombstone.jpg|thumb|left|Allen Street (former US&nbsp;80) in Tombstone]]\nPassing the eastern terminus of [[Arizona State Route 82|SR&nbsp;82]] near [[Fairbank, Arizona|Fairbank]], US&nbsp;80 came into Tombstone on SR&nbsp;80 and Sumner Street. At Fremont Street, US&nbsp;80 continued southwest for one block to Allen Street, then continued southeast on Allen through the heart of Tombstone, passing the [[O.K. Corral (building)|O.K. Corral]] and the site of the infamous [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral|gunfight]]. The highway turned northeast on to 6th Street for one block, then turned southeast on to Fremont Street. US&nbsp;80 exited Tombstone on Fremont Street, before continuing southeast on SR&nbsp;80, passing the eastern terminus of [[Arizona State Route 90|SR&nbsp;90]]. At the intersection with Old Divide Road, US&nbsp;80 headed south over Mule Pass on the winding mountain road over what was once believed to be the [[Continental Divide]]. On the other side of the pass, US&nbsp;80 then curved east onto Tombstone Canyon Road, entering the mining town of [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]].<ref name=\"DavidRumsey02\" /><ref name=\"Google\" /><ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\n[[File:PHELPS DODGE CORP.

Rows of iconic neon signed motels aligned US&nbsp;80 in the many towns and cities it passed through, including Tucson's Miracle Mile.

In 1950, the [[Phelps Dodge Corporation]] and Bisbee Chamber of Commerce entered a cooperative agreement to create a new open pit mine. The new mine would be named the [[Lavender Pit]] after H.M. Lavender, the vice president and general manager of Phelps Dodge. Phelps Dodge would pay the expenses of moving the displaced residents and utilities, including US&nbsp;80 itself, which ran through the proposed pit area. The project of relocating US&nbsp;80 was awarded to the A.J. Gilbert Construction Company of [[Warren, Arizona]]. The relocation of US&nbsp;80 and all other displaced persons and utilities was completed between January and April 1951. US&nbsp;80 now ran the edge of the new open pit mine. An observation tower was also constructed on the new alignment of US&nbsp;80 to view the pit from. Soon after, work began on stripping and excavating the land officially opening the Lavender Pit. In total, the project cost $25 Million and required 250 total structures to be demolished and relocated.

After turning professional later that year, he defeated [[Chris Byrd]] in 2000 to win the WBO heavyweight title. Klitschko's first reign as champion ended in an upset knockout loss to [[Corrie Sanders]] in 2003, which was followed by another knockout loss to [[Lamon Brewster]] in 2004. It was during this time that Klitschko hired [[Emanuel Steward]] as his trainer, which began an eight-year partnership that lasted until Steward's death in 2012. In particular, Steward was credited with Klitschko's transition from an aggressive puncher to a more defensively-oriented boxer, much as he had done with [[Lennox Lewis]] in 1995 to 2003.\n\nIn 2006, Klitschko regained a portion of the world heavyweight championship after defeating Chris Byrd in a rematch to win the IBF and IBO titles. He won the WBO title for a second time by defeating [[Sultan Ibragimov]] in 2008. Following his defeat of [[Ruslan Chagaev]] in 2009, Klitschko was awarded ''The Ring'' title, and lastly he won the WBA title from [[David Haye]] in 2011. In September 2015, Klitschko was ranked as the world's best active boxer, [[pound for pound]], by [[BoxRec]]; in November 2014, he reached a career peak of second best on [[The Ring magazine Pound for Pound|''The Ring''{{'}}s pound for pound]] list.\n\nKlitschko holds the [[World heavyweight boxing championship records and statistics#Longest title reigns|record for the longest cumulative heavyweight title reign]] of all time, with 4,382 days as world heavyweight champion.<ref name=business-insider-sg>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.sg/wladimir-klitschko-plotting-boxing-comeback-2019-10|title=Wladimir Klitschko is plotting a spectacular boxing comeback, and he wants to break an old heavyweight record|first=|last=Business Insider Singapore|website=businessinsider.sg}}</ref> Wladimir has defeated [[World heavyweight boxing championship records and statistics#Most opponents beaten in title fights|23 opponents for the world heavyweight championship]], more than any other heavyweight in history.<ref name=business-insider-sg/><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.croatiaweek.com/klitschko-believes-hrgovic-will-become-world-boxing-champ/|title= Klitschko believes Hrgovi\u0107 will become world boxing champ|work=croatiaweek.com|accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref> Until his loss to [[Tyson Fury]] in November 2015, Klitschko was recognized as the lineal champion by the [[Transnational Boxing Rankings Board]], while the WBA recognised him as one of its \"[[WBA (Super)|Super champions]]\", a distinction given to boxers who hold that title in addition to those by other sanctioning bodies in the same division.

Klitschko's first reign as champion ended in an upset knockout loss to [[Corrie Sanders]] in 2003, which was followed by another knockout loss to [[Lamon Brewster]] in 2004. It was during this time that Klitschko hired [[Emanuel Steward]] as his trainer, which began an eight-year partnership that lasted until Steward's death in 2012. In particular, Steward was credited with Klitschko's transition from an aggressive puncher to a more defensively-oriented boxer, much as he had done with [[Lennox Lewis]] in 1995 to 2003.\n\nIn 2006, Klitschko regained a portion of the world heavyweight championship after defeating Chris Byrd in a rematch to win the IBF and IBO titles.
