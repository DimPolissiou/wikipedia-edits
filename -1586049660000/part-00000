[[AllMusic]] writer Jason Lymangrover gave the album three stars out of five, and states that \"for their 16th album, ''True North'', Bad Religion are still fully inspired and delivering sturdy, memorable, and solidly crafted material.\" For the music and lyrics, he states that guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]] \"clearly knows what works for the band, and he sticks to the formula of uptempo, muscular anthems with chunky guitar parts and contemplative lyrics\" and adds that vocalist [[Greg Graffin]] \"continues to question the government, Christianity, and American society at large, sounding expressive, with a little less grit than usual, but tireless.\" Lymangrover also claims that ''True North'' \"shows flashes of their earlier work, and is a step up from their last album, 2010's ''The Dissent of Man'', in terms of aggression\" and describes the album as \"the best material they've written since adding a third guitarist.\"<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nSam Gnerre, staff writer of [[Los Angeles Daily News]], claims that the album \"still finds room for the band's knack for intelligent wordplay amid the maelstrom, working in a [[Sham 69]] reference on 'Robin Hood in Reverse' and warned that 'popular consensus doesn't make it right' on 'Popular Consensus.'\" He also describes \"My Head Is Full of Ghosts\" and \"In Their Hearts Is Right\" as a \"clever song structure vocal interplay\" while he claims that \"Nothing to Dismay\" has its \"most fist-shaking sing-along chorus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/54474/Bad-Religion-True-North/|title=CD Review: Bad Religion, 'True North'|date=January 19, 2013|publisher=[[Los Angeles Daily News|LA Daily News]]|accessdate=2013-01-20}}</ref>\n\nMetal Ireland stated \"When writing ''True North'', the band imposed a rule on themselves: no songs longer than three minutes.

{"title_page": "Religious persecution", "text_new": "{{short description|Systematic mistreatment of an individual or group as a response to their religious beliefs or affiliations or lack thereof}}\n{{Discrimination sidebar}}\n'''Religious persecution''' is the systematic mistreatment of an individual or a group of individuals as a response to their [[Religion|religious beliefs or affiliations]] or their lack thereof. The tendency of societies or groups within societies to alienate or repress different [[subculture]]s is a recurrent theme in [[History of the world|human history]]. Moreover, because a person's religion often determines his or her [[morality]], [[world view]], [[self-image]], attitudes towards others, and overall personal identity to a significant extent, religious differences can be significant cultural, personal, and social factors.\n\nReligious persecution may be triggered by religious bigotry (i.e. when members of a dominant group denigrate religions other than their own) or it may be triggered by the state when it views a particular religious group as a threat to its interests or security. At a societal level, the [[dehumanisation]] of a particular religious group may readily lead to [[violence]] or other forms of [[persecution]]. Indeed, in many countries, religious persecution has resulted in so much violence that it is considered a [[human rights]] problem.\n\n==Definition==\nReligious persecution is defined as violence or [[discrimination]] against religious minorities, actions which are intended to deprive minorities of [[Civil and political rights|political rights]] and force them to assimilate, leave, or live as [[second-class citizen]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=David T. Smith|title=Religious Persecution and Political Order in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9nECgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|date=12 November 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-11731-0|pages=26\u2013|quote=\"Persecution\" in this study refers to violence or discrimination against members of a religious minority because of their religious affiliation. Persecution involves the most damaging expressions of [[prejudice]] against an [[In-group and out-group|out-group]], going beyond verbal abuse and social avoidance.29 It refers to actions that are intended to deprive individuals of their political rights and force minorities to assimilate, leave, or live as second-class citizens. When these actions persistently happen over a period of time, and include large numbers of both perpetrators and victims, we may refer to them as being part of a \"campaign\" of persecution that usually has the goal of excluding the targeted minority from the polity.}}</ref> In the aspect of a state's policy, it may be defined as violations of [[freedom of thought]], [[conscience]] and belief which are spread in accordance with a systematic and active state policy which encourages actions such as [[harassment]], [[intimidation]] and the imposition of [[punishment]]s in order to infringe or threaten the targeted minority's [[right to life]], [[integrity]] or [[liberty]].<ref name=\"Ghanea-Hercock2013\">{{cite book|author=Nazila Ghanea-Hercock|title=The Challenge of Religious Discrimination at the Dawn of the New Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uU3vCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA91|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-017-5968-7|pages=91\u201392}}</ref> The distinction between religious persecution and [[religious intolerance]] lies in the fact that in most cases, the latter is motivated by the sentiment of the population, which may be tolerated or encouraged by the state.<ref name=\"Ghanea-Hercock2013\"/> The denial of people's [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] on the basis of their religion is most often described as [[religious discrimination]], rather than religious persecution.\n\nExamples of persecution include the confiscation or destruction of property, [[incitement]] of [[hatred]], arrests, imprisonment, beatings, [[torture]], [[murder]], and executions. Religious persecution can be considered the opposite of [[freedom of religion]].\n\nBateman has differentiated different degrees of persecution.  \"It must be personally costly...

Jews are an ethno-religious group and Nazi persecution was based on their race]]\nOther acts of violence, such as [[war]], [[torture]], and [[ethnic cleansing]] not aimed at religion in particular, may nevertheless take on the qualities of religious persecution when one or more of the parties involved are characterized by religious homogeneity; an example being when conflicting populations that belong to different [[ethnic groups]] often also belong to different religions or denominations. The difference between religious and ethnic identity might sometimes be obscure (see [[Ethnoreligious]]); cases of [[genocide]] in the 20th century cannot be explained in full by citing religious differences. Still, cases such as the [[Greek genocide]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], and the [[Assyrian Genocide]] are sometimes seen as religious persecution and blur the lines between ethnic and religious violence.\n\nSince the Early modern period, an increasing number of [[religious cleansing]]s were entwined with ethnic elements.<ref name=\"Mann2005\">{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&pg=PR53|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53854-1|pages=53\u2013}}</ref>Since religion is an important or central marker of ethnic identity, some conflicts can best be described as \"ethno-religious conflicts\".<ref name=\"BercovitchKremenyuk2008\">{{cite book|author1=Jacob Bercovitch|author2=Victor Kremenyuk|author3=I William Zartman|title=The SAGE Handbook of Conflict Resolution|chapter=Characteristics of ethno-religious conflicts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cqjpHmhTZsC&pg=PA265|date=3 December 2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-0659-1|pages=265\u2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Nazi]] [[antisemitism]] provides another example of the contentious divide between ethnic and religious persecution, because [[Nazi propaganda]] tended to construct its image of Jews as belonging to a race, it de-emphasized Jews as being defined by their religion. In keeping with what they were taught in Nazi propaganda, the perpetrators of the [[Holocaust]] made no distinction between secular Jews, atheistic Jews, [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox Jews]] and Jews who had converted to [[Christianity]]. The Nazis also persecuted the [[Catholic Church]] in [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany|Germany]] and [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|Poland]].\n\n==Persecution for heresy and blasphemy==\n{{Main|Heresy|Blasphemy}}\n{{See also|Christian heresy|Heresy in Orthodox Judaism}}\nThe persecution of beliefs that are deemed schismatic is one thing; the persecution of beliefs that are deemed heretical or blasphemous is another. Although a public disagreement on secondary matters might be serious enough, it has often only led to [[religious discrimination]]. A public renunciation of the core elements of a religious doctrine under the same circumstances would, on the other hand, have put one in far greater danger. While [[dissenter]]s from the official Church only faced fines and imprisonment in Protestant England, six people were executed for heresy or blasphemy during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and two more were executed in 1612 under [[James I of England|James I]].<ref name=\"John Coffey 2000, p. 26\">John Coffey (2000), p. 26</ref>\n\nSimilarly, heretical sects like [[Catharism|Cathars]], [[Waldensians]] and [[Lollardy|Lollards]] were brutally suppressed in [[Western Europe]], while, at the same time, Catholic Christians lived side by side with 'schismatic' Orthodox Christians after the [[East-West Schism]] in the borderlands of [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>Benjamin j. Kaplan (2007), ''Divided by Faith, Religious Conflict and the Practice of Toleration in Early Modern Europe'', p. 3</ref>\n\n==Persecution for political reasons==\n[[File:HooperBurning.jpg|thumb|Protestant Bishop [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]] was burned at the stake by Queen [[Mary I of England]]]]\nMore than 300 Roman Catholics were put to death for [[treason]] by English governments between 1535 and 1681, thus they were executed for secular rather than [[religious offense]]s.<ref name=\"John Coffey 2000, p. 26\"/> In 1570, [[Pope Pius V]] issued his [[papal bull]] ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'', which absolved Catholics from their obligations to the government.<ref>Coffey 2000: 85.</ref> This dramatically worsened the persecution of Catholics in England. English governments continued to fear the fictitious [[Popish Plot]]. The 1584 [[Parliament of England]], declared in \"[[An Act against Jesuits, seminary priests, and such other like disobedient persons]]\" that the purpose of [[Jesuit]] missionaries who had come to Britain was \"to stir up and move sedition, rebellion and open hostility\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 86.</ref> Consequently, Jesuit priests like [[Saint John Ogilvie]] were hanged. This somehow contrasts with the image of the [[Elizabethan era]] as the time of [[William Shakespeare]], but compared to the antecedent [[Marian Persecutions]] there is an important difference to consider. [[Mary I of England]] had been motivated by a religious zeal to purge heresy from her land, and during her short reign from 1553 to 1558 about 290 Protestants<ref>Coffey 2000: 81.</ref> had been burned at the stake for heresy, whereas [[Elizabeth I of England]] \"acted out of fear for the security of her realm.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 92.</ref>\n\n==By location==\nThe descriptive use of the term religious persecution is rather difficult. Religious persecution has occurred in different historical, geographical and social contexts since at least [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. Until the 18th century, some groups were nearly universally persecuted for their religious views, such as [[Discrimination against atheists|atheists]],<ref name=\"onfray\">{{cite book|last=Onfray|first=Michel|others=Leggatt, Jeremy (translator) |title=Atheist manifesto: the case against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing|year=2007|page=|isbn=978-1-55970-820-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QpEAYMo7pFkC&pg=PA24}}</ref> [[Persecution of Jews|Jews]]<ref name=Flannery /> and [[Persecution of Zoroastrians|Zoroastrians]].<ref name=\"hj303\">{{Cite book|last =Hinnells|first =John R.|title =Zoroastrians in Britain: the Ratanbai Katrak lectures, University of Oxford 1985|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E4l0J5bf3GYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=|year=1996|edition=Illustrated|publisher =Oxford University Press|isbn =9780198261933|page=303}}</ref>\n\n===Roman Empire===\n[[File:Caravaggio-Crucifixion of Peter.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saint Peter]], an apostle of Jesus, was executed by the Romans]]\n{{See also|Persecution of Ancient Greek religion|Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire}}\nEarly [[Christianity]] also came into conflict with the Roman Empire, and it may have been more threatening to the established polytheistic order than Judaism had been, because of the importance of [[evangelism]] in Christianity. Under [[Nero]], the Jewish exemption from the requirement to participate in public cults was lifted and Rome began to actively persecute [[Monotheism|monotheists]]. This persecution ended in 313 AD with the [[Edict of Milan]], and Christianity was made the official religion of the empire in 380 AD. By the eighth century Christianity had attained a clear ascendancy across Europe and neighboring regions, and a period of consolidation began which was marked by the pursuit of [[Heresy|heretics]], [[Paganism|heathens]], [[Jews]], [[Muslim]]s, and various other religious groups.\n\n===Early modern England===\nOne period of religious persecution which has been extensively studied is [[Early modern period|early modern]] England, since the rejection of religious persecution, now common in the [[Western world]], originated there. The English 'Call for Toleration' was a turning point in the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]], and early modern England stands out to the historians as a place and time in which literally \"hundreds of books and tracts were published either for or against religious toleration.\"<ref name=\"Coffey00-14\">Coffey 2000: 14.</ref><!--This time has been debated thoroughly by historians, whereas, for the obvious reason of the over-abundance of material, historians generally avoid writing books on the whole of human history. reword?-->\n\nThe most ambitious chronicle of that time is [[Wilbur Kitchener Jordan|W.K.Jordan]]'s [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''The Development of Religious Toleration in England, 1558-1660'' (four volumes, published 1932-1940). Jordan wrote as the threat of [[fascism]] rose in Europe, and this work is seen as a defense of the fragile [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of [[humanism]] and [[Toleration|tolerance]].<ref>Coffey 2000, 2</ref> More recent introductions to this period are ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England, 1558\u20131689'' (2000) by [[John Coffey (historian)|John Coffey]] and ''Charitable hatred. Tolerance and intolerance in England, 1500-1700'' (2006) by Alexandra Walsham. To understand why religious persecution has occurred, historians like Coffey \"pay close attention to what the persecutors said they were doing.\"<ref name=\"Coffey00-14\"/>\n\n====Ecclesiastical dissent and civil tolerance====\nNo religion is free from internal dissent, although the degree of dissent that is tolerated within a particular religious organization can strongly vary. This degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church is described as ''ecclesiastical tolerance'',<ref>John Coffey (2000), p. 12</ref> and is one form of [[religious toleration]]. However, when people nowadays speak of religious tolerance, they most often mean ''civil tolerance'', which refers to the degree of religious diversity that is tolerated within the state.\n\nIn the absence of civil toleration, someone who finds himself in disagreement with his congregation doesn't have the option to leave and chose a different faith - simply because there is only one recognized faith in the country (at least officially). In modern western [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] any citizen may join and leave a religious organization at will; In western societies, this is taken for granted, but actually, this legal [[separation of Church and State]] only started to emerge a few centuries ago.\n\nIn the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]], the notion of civil tolerance allowed Christian theologians to reconcile Jesus' commandment to [[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|love one's enemies]] with other parts of the [[New Testament]] that are rather strict regarding dissent within the church. Before that, theologians like [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]]<!--or [[Thomas Thorowgood]] in protestant England--> had reasoned from the ecclesiastical intolerance of the early Christian church in the New Testament to the civil intolerance of the Christian state.<ref>John Coffey (2000), p. 33</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n====Religious uniformity in early modern Europe====\n{{Main|Religious uniformity}}\n[[File:La masacre de San Bartolom\u00e9, por Fran\u00e7ois Dubois.jpg|thumb|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of French Protestants in 1572]]\nBy contrast to the notion of civil tolerance, in [[early modern Europe]] the subjects were required to attend the [[state church]]; This attitude can be described as ''territoriality'' or ''[[religious uniformity]]'', and its underlying assumption is brought to a point by a statement of the Anglican theologian [[Richard Hooker]]: \"There is not any man of the Church of England but the same man is also a member of the [English] commonwealth; nor any man a member of the commonwealth, which is not also of the Church of England.\"<ref>''The Works of Richard Hooker'', II, p. 485; quoted after: John Coffey (2000), p. 33</ref>\n\nBefore a vigorous debate about religious persecution took place in England (starting in the 1640s), for centuries in Europe, religion had been tied to territory. In England there had been several [[Act of Uniformity (disambiguation)|Acts of Uniformity]]; in continental Europe the Latin phrase \"[[cuius regio, eius religio]]\" had been coined in the 16th century and applied as a fundament for the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555). It was pushed to the extreme by [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist regime]]s, particularly by the French kings [[Louis XIV]] and his successors. It was under their rule that [[Catholicism]] became the sole compulsory allowed religion in France and that the [[huguenots]] had to massively leave the country. Persecution meant that the state was committed to secure religious uniformity by coercive measures, as eminently obvious in a statement of [[Roger L'Estrange]]: \"That which you call persecution, I translate Uniformity\".<ref>quoted after Coffey (2000), 27</ref>\n\nHowever, in the 17th century writers like [[Pierre Bayle]], [[John Locke]], [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]] and Roger William broke the link between territory and faith, which eventually resulted in a shift from territoriality to religious voluntarism.<ref name=Coffey58>Coffey 2000: 58.</ref> It was Locke who, in his [[A Letter Concerning Toleration|Letter Concerning Toleration]], defined the state in purely secular terms:<ref name=Coffey57>Coffey 2000: 57.</ref> \"The commonwealth seems to me to be a society of men constituted only for the procuring, preserving, and advancing their own civil interests.\"<ref name=Locke89>John Locke (1698): [[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]; [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/locke/locke2/locke-t/locke_toleration.html Online edition]</ref> Concerning the church, he went on: \"A church, then, I take to be a voluntary society of men, joining themselves together of their own accord.\"<ref name=Locke89 /> With this treatise, John Locke laid one of the most important intellectual foundations of the [[separation of church and state]], which ultimately led to the [[secular state]].\n\n===Russia===\nThe Bishop of Vladimir Feodor turned some people into slaves, others were locked in prison, cut their heads, burnt eyes, cut tongues or crucified on walls. Some heretics were executed by burning them alive. According to an inscription of Khan Mengual-Temir, Metropolitan Kiril was granted the right to heavily punish with death for blasphemy against the Orthodox Church or breach of ecclesiastical privileges. He advised all means of destruction to be used against heretics, but without bloodshed, in the name of 'saving souls'. Heretics were drowned. Novgorod Bishop Gennady Gonzov turned to Tsar [[Ivan III]] requesting the death of heretics.

The tendency of societies or groups within societies to alienate or repress different [[subculture]]s is a recurrent theme in [[History of the world|human history]]. Moreover, because a person's religion often determines his or her [[morality]], [[world view]], [[self-image]], attitudes towards others, and overall personal identity to a significant extent, religious differences can be significant cultural, personal, and social factors.\n\nReligious persecution may be triggered by religious bigotry (i.e. when members of a dominant group denigrate religions other than their own) or it may be triggered by the state when it views a particular religious group as a threat to its interests or security. At a societal level, the [[dehumanisation]] of a particular religious group may readily lead to [[violence]] or other forms of [[persecution]]. Indeed, in many countries, religious persecution has resulted in so much violence that it is considered a [[human rights]] problem.\n\n==Definition==\nReligious persecution is defined as violence or [[discrimination]] against religious minorities, actions which are intended to deprive minorities of [[Civil and political rights|political rights]] and force them to assimilate, leave, or live as [[second-class citizen]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=David T.

Jews are an ethno-religious group and Nazi persecution was based on their race]]\nOther acts of violence, such as [[war]], [[torture]], and [[ethnic cleansing]] not aimed at religion in particular, may nevertheless take on the qualities of religious persecution when one or more of the parties involved are characterized by religious homogeneity; an example being when conflicting populations that belong to different [[ethnic groups]] often also belong to different religions or denominations. The difference between religious and ethnic identity might sometimes be obscure (see [[Ethnoreligious]]); cases of [[genocide]] in the 20th century cannot be explained in full by citing religious differences. Still, cases such as the [[Greek genocide]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], and the [[Assyrian Genocide]] are sometimes seen as religious persecution and blur the lines between ethnic and religious violence.\n\nSince the Early modern period, an increasing number of [[religious cleansing]]s were entwined with ethnic elements.<ref name=\"Mann2005\">{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&pg=PR53|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53854-1|pages=53\u2013}}</ref>Since religion is an important or central marker of ethnic identity, some conflicts can best be described as \"ethno-religious conflicts\".<ref name=\"BercovitchKremenyuk2008\">{{cite book|author1=Jacob Bercovitch|author2=Victor Kremenyuk|author3=I William Zartman|title=The SAGE Handbook of Conflict Resolution|chapter=Characteristics of ethno-religious conflicts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cqjpHmhTZsC&pg=PA265|date=3 December 2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-0659-1|pages=265\u2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Nazi]] [[antisemitism]] provides another example of the contentious divide between ethnic and religious persecution, because [[Nazi propaganda]] tended to construct its image of Jews as belonging to a race, it de-emphasized Jews as being defined by their religion. In keeping with what they were taught in Nazi propaganda, the perpetrators of the [[Holocaust]] made no distinction between secular Jews, atheistic Jews, [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox Jews]] and Jews who had converted to [[Christianity]]. The Nazis also persecuted the [[Catholic Church]] in [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany|Germany]] and [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|Poland]].\n\n==Persecution for heresy and blasphemy==\n{{Main|Heresy|Blasphemy}}\n{{See also|Christian heresy|Heresy in Orthodox Judaism}}\nThe persecution of beliefs that are deemed schismatic is one thing; the persecution of beliefs that are deemed heretical or blasphemous is another. Although a public disagreement on secondary matters might be serious enough, it has often only led to [[religious discrimination]]. A public renunciation of the core elements of a religious doctrine under the same circumstances would, on the other hand, have put one in far greater danger. While [[dissenter]]s from the official Church only faced fines and imprisonment in Protestant England, six people were executed for heresy or blasphemy during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and two more were executed in 1612 under [[James I of England|James I]].<ref name=\"John Coffey 2000, p. 26\">John Coffey (2000), p. 26</ref>\n\nSimilarly, heretical sects like [[Catharism|Cathars]], [[Waldensians]] and [[Lollardy|Lollards]] were brutally suppressed in [[Western Europe]], while, at the same time, Catholic Christians lived side by side with 'schismatic' Orthodox Christians after the [[East-West Schism]] in the borderlands of [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>Benjamin j. Kaplan (2007), ''Divided by Faith, Religious Conflict and the Practice of Toleration in Early Modern Europe'', p. 3</ref>\n\n==Persecution for political reasons==\n[[File:HooperBurning.jpg|thumb|Protestant Bishop [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]] was burned at the stake by Queen [[Mary I of England]]]]\nMore than 300 Roman Catholics were put to death for [[treason]] by English governments between 1535 and 1681, thus they were executed for secular rather than [[religious offense]]s.<ref name=\"John Coffey 2000, p. 26\"/> In 1570, [[Pope Pius V]] issued his [[papal bull]] ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'', which absolved Catholics from their obligations to the government.<ref>Coffey 2000: 85.</ref> This dramatically worsened the persecution of Catholics in England. English governments continued to fear the fictitious [[Popish Plot]]. The 1584 [[Parliament of England]], declared in \"[[An Act against Jesuits, seminary priests, and such other like disobedient persons]]\" that the purpose of [[Jesuit]] missionaries who had come to Britain was \"to stir up and move sedition, rebellion and open hostility\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 86.</ref> Consequently, Jesuit priests like [[Saint John Ogilvie]] were hanged. This somehow contrasts with the image of the [[Elizabethan era]] as the time of [[William Shakespeare]], but compared to the antecedent [[Marian Persecutions]] there is an important difference to consider. [[Mary I of England]] had been motivated by a religious zeal to purge heresy from her land, and during her short reign from 1553 to 1558 about 290 Protestants<ref>Coffey 2000: 81.</ref> had been burned at the stake for heresy, whereas [[Elizabeth I of England]] \"acted out of fear for the security of her realm.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 92.</ref>\n\n==By location==\nThe descriptive use of the term religious persecution is rather difficult. Religious persecution has occurred in different historical, geographical and social contexts since at least [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. Until the 18th century, some groups were nearly universally persecuted for their religious views, such as [[Discrimination against atheists|atheists]],<ref name=\"onfray\">{{cite book|last=Onfray|first=Michel|others=Leggatt, Jeremy (translator) |title=Atheist manifesto: the case against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing|year=2007|page=|isbn=978-1-55970-820-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QpEAYMo7pFkC&pg=PA24}}</ref> [[Persecution of Jews|Jews]]<ref name=Flannery /> and [[Persecution of Zoroastrians|Zoroastrians]].<ref name=\"hj303\">{{Cite book|last =Hinnells|first =John R.|title =Zoroastrians in Britain: the Ratanbai Katrak lectures, University of Oxford 1985|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E4l0J5bf3GYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=|year=1996|edition=Illustrated|publisher =Oxford University Press|isbn =9780198261933|page=303}}</ref>\n\n===Roman Empire===\n[[File:Caravaggio-Crucifixion of Peter.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saint Peter]], an apostle of Jesus, was executed by the Romans]]\n{{See also|Persecution of Ancient Greek religion|Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire}}\nEarly [[Christianity]] also came into conflict with the Roman Empire, and it may have been more threatening to the established polytheistic order than Judaism had been, because of the importance of [[evangelism]] in Christianity. Under [[Nero]], the Jewish exemption from the requirement to participate in public cults was lifted and Rome began to actively persecute [[Monotheism|monotheists]]. This persecution ended in 313 AD with the [[Edict of Milan]], and Christianity was made the official religion of the empire in 380 AD. By the eighth century Christianity had attained a clear ascendancy across Europe and neighboring regions, and a period of consolidation began which was marked by the pursuit of [[Heresy|heretics]], [[Paganism|heathens]], [[Jews]], [[Muslim]]s, and various other religious groups.\n\n===Early modern England===\nOne period of religious persecution which has been extensively studied is [[Early modern period|early modern]] England, since the rejection of religious persecution, now common in the [[Western world]], originated there. The English 'Call for Toleration' was a turning point in the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]], and early modern England stands out to the historians as a place and time in which literally \"hundreds of books and tracts were published either for or against religious toleration.\"<ref name=\"Coffey00-14\">Coffey 2000: 14.</ref><!--This time has been debated thoroughly by historians, whereas, for the obvious reason of the over-abundance of material, historians generally avoid writing books on the whole of human history. reword?-->\n\nThe most ambitious chronicle of that time is [[Wilbur Kitchener Jordan|W.K.Jordan]]'s [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''The Development of Religious Toleration in England, 1558-1660'' (four volumes, published 1932-1940). Jordan wrote as the threat of [[fascism]] rose in Europe, and this work is seen as a defense of the fragile [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of [[humanism]] and [[Toleration|tolerance]].<ref>Coffey 2000, 2</ref> More recent introductions to this period are ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England, 1558\u20131689'' (2000) by [[John Coffey (historian)|John Coffey]] and ''Charitable hatred. Tolerance and intolerance in England, 1500-1700'' (2006) by Alexandra Walsham. To understand why religious persecution has occurred, historians like Coffey \"pay close attention to what the persecutors said they were doing.\"<ref name=\"Coffey00-14\"/>\n\n====Ecclesiastical dissent and civil tolerance====\nNo religion is free from internal dissent, although the degree of dissent that is tolerated within a particular religious organization can strongly vary. This degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church is described as ''ecclesiastical tolerance'',<ref>John Coffey (2000), p. 12</ref> and is one form of [[religious toleration]]. However, when people nowadays speak of religious tolerance, they most often mean ''civil tolerance'', which refers to the degree of religious diversity that is tolerated within the state.\n\nIn the absence of civil toleration, someone who finds himself in disagreement with his congregation doesn't have the option to leave and chose a different faith - simply because there is only one recognized faith in the country (at least officially). In modern western [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] any citizen may join and leave a religious organization at will; In western societies, this is taken for granted, but actually, this legal [[separation of Church and State]] only started to emerge a few centuries ago.\n\nIn the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]], the notion of civil tolerance allowed Christian theologians to reconcile Jesus' commandment to [[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|love one's enemies]] with other parts of the [[New Testament]] that are rather strict regarding dissent within the church. Before that, theologians like [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]]<!--or [[Thomas Thorowgood]] in protestant England--> had reasoned from the ecclesiastical intolerance of the early Christian church in the New Testament to the civil intolerance of the Christian state.<ref>John Coffey (2000), p. 33</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n====Religious uniformity in early modern Europe====\n{{Main|Religious uniformity}}\n[[File:La masacre de San Bartolom\u00e9, por Fran\u00e7ois Dubois.jpg|thumb|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of French Protestants in 1572]]\nBy contrast to the notion of civil tolerance, in [[early modern Europe]] the subjects were required to attend the [[state church]]; This attitude can be described as ''territoriality'' or ''[[religious uniformity]]'', and its underlying assumption is brought to a point by a statement of the Anglican theologian [[Richard Hooker]]: \"There is not any man of the Church of England but the same man is also a member of the [English] commonwealth; nor any man a member of the commonwealth, which is not also of the Church of England.\"<ref>''The Works of Richard Hooker'', II, p. 485; quoted after: John Coffey (2000), p. 33</ref>\n\nBefore a vigorous debate about religious persecution took place in England (starting in the 1640s), for centuries in Europe, religion had been tied to territory. In England there had been several [[Act of Uniformity (disambiguation)|Acts of Uniformity]]; in continental Europe the Latin phrase \"[[cuius regio, eius religio]]\" had been coined in the 16th century and applied as a fundament for the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555). It was pushed to the extreme by [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist regime]]s, particularly by the French kings [[Louis XIV]] and his successors. It was under their rule that [[Catholicism]] became the sole compulsory allowed religion in France and that the [[huguenots]] had to massively leave the country. Persecution meant that the state was committed to secure religious uniformity by coercive measures, as eminently obvious in a statement of [[Roger L'Estrange]]: \"That which you call persecution, I translate Uniformity\".<ref>quoted after Coffey (2000), 27</ref>\n\nHowever, in the 17th century writers like [[Pierre Bayle]], [[John Locke]], [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]] and Roger William broke the link between territory and faith, which eventually resulted in a shift from territoriality to religious voluntarism.<ref name=Coffey58>Coffey 2000: 58.</ref> It was Locke who, in his [[A Letter Concerning Toleration|Letter Concerning Toleration]], defined the state in purely secular terms:<ref name=Coffey57>Coffey 2000: 57.</ref> \"The commonwealth seems to me to be a society of men constituted only for the procuring, preserving, and advancing their own civil interests.\"<ref name=Locke89>John Locke (1698): [[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]; [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/locke/locke2/locke-t/locke_toleration.html Online edition]</ref> Concerning the church, he went on: \"A church, then, I take to be a voluntary society of men, joining themselves together of their own accord.\"<ref name=Locke89 /> With this treatise, John Locke laid one of the most important intellectual foundations of the [[separation of church and state]], which ultimately led to the [[secular state]].\n\n===Russia===\nThe Bishop of Vladimir Feodor turned some people into slaves, others were locked in prison, cut their heads, burnt eyes, cut tongues or crucified on walls. Some heretics were executed by burning them alive. According to an inscription of Khan Mengual-Temir, Metropolitan Kiril was granted the right to heavily punish with death for blasphemy against the Orthodox Church or breach of ecclesiastical privileges. He advised all means of destruction to be used against heretics, but without bloodshed, in the name of 'saving souls'. Heretics were drowned. Novgorod Bishop Gennady Gonzov turned to Tsar [[Ivan III]] requesting the death of heretics. Gennady admired the Spanish inquisitors, especially his contemporary [[Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada|Torquemada]], who for 15 years of inquisition activity burned and punished thousands of people.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} As in Rome, persecuted fled to depopulated areas.

In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as [[UNESCO]] and [[World Health Organization]] the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. Given that the Hindu population in East Pakistan was around 11 million in 1971, this suggests that up to 8 million, or more than 70% of the Hindu population had fled the country.The [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning journalist [[Sydney Schanberg]] covered the start of the war and wrote extensively on the suffering of the East Bengalis, including the Hindus both during and after the conflict.

A later DVD series was released, entitled ''Disney Princess Stories'', featuring content similar to the previous release.\n\nBelle had her own live-action television series titled ''[[Sing Me a Story with Belle]]''. The first eight Disney Princesses also made appearances on the animated TV series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'' and Belle also made an appearance (along with her husband, Beast) on a short episode from the TV animated series ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''. The television special ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'' starred [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Ariel.\n\nIn early 2007, Disney announced ''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales'', a new series of [[direct-to-video]] features that feature new stories for the Disney Princesses. The first movie in the series entitled ''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]'', was released on September 4, 2007. It is a musical film featuring new tales about Princess Jasmine and the first new tale about Princess Aurora since the original ''Sleeping Beauty''.\n\nOriginally, ''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: A Kingdom of Kindness'' was announced as the first film in the series, which contained a different Princess Aurora story, and had a Belle story rather than a Princess Jasmine story.

Snow White and Belle were main characters while the rest made recurring and or guest appearances. Beginning in season 7, Cinderella, Tiana and Rapunzel were main characters.

The old stock Yankee population had large families, often bearing up to ten children in one household.  Most people were expected to have their own piece of land to farm, and due to the massive and nonstop population boom, land in New England became scarce as every son claimed his own farmstead.  As a result, there was not enough land for every family to have a self-sustaining farm, and Yankee settlers began leaving New England for the [[Midwestern United States]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">A Twentieth Century History and Biographical Record of Elkhart County, Indiana  edited by Anthony Deahl, Lewis Publishing Company, 1905</ref>\n\nThey were aided in this effort by the construction and completion of the [[Erie Canal]] which made traveling to the region much easier, causing an additional surge in migrants coming from New England.  Added to this was the end of the [[Black Hawk War]], which made the region much safer to travel through and settle in for white settlers. However, the Black Hawk War also forced the native people who called Goshen home for so long to leave. The 1833 [[Treaty of Chicago]] ultimately set the conditions that would force the Potawatomi in particular to leave the Midwest, Goshen included, in 1837. This forced exile is known today as the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nThese settlers were primarily members of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]], though due to the [[Second Great Awakening]], many of them had converted to [[Methodism]], and some had become [[Baptists]] before coming to what is now Indiana. The Congregational Church has subsequently gone through many divisions, and some factions, including those in Goshen, are now known as the [[Church of Christ]] and the [[United Church of Christ]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  When the New Englanders arrived in what is now Elkhart County there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. They laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:palmsundaytwintornadoes.jpg|thumb|right|This double tornado hit the Midway Trailer Court northwest of Goshen on U.S. 33, Palm Sunday, 1965.]]\nOn Palm Sunday, April 11, 1965, a [[1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak|large outbreak of tornadoes]] struck the Midwest.

They founded a large number of towns and counties across what is known as the [[Northern Tier (United States)|Northern Tier]] of the upper midwest.  It was in this context that Goshen was named.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Yankee Exodus: An Account of Migration from New England by Stewart Hall Holbrook University of Washington Press, 1968</ref><ref>American Zion: The Old Testament as a Political Text from the Revolution to ...

The old stock Yankee population had large families, often bearing up to ten children in one household.  Most people were expected to have their own piece of land to farm, and due to the massive and nonstop population boom, land in New England became scarce as every son claimed his own farmstead.  As a result, there was not enough land for every family to have a self-sustaining farm, and Yankee settlers began leaving New England for the [[Midwestern United States]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">A Twentieth Century History and Biographical Record of Elkhart County, Indiana  edited by Anthony Deahl, Lewis Publishing Company, 1905</ref>\n\nThey were aided in this effort by the construction and completion of the [[Erie Canal]] which made traveling to the region much easier, causing an additional surge in migrants coming from New England.  Added to this was the end of the [[Black Hawk War]], which made the region much safer to travel through and settle in for white settlers. However, the Black Hawk War also forced the native people who called Goshen home for so long to leave. The 1833 [[Treaty of Chicago]] ultimately set the conditions that would force the Potawatomi in particular to leave the Midwest, Goshen included, in 1837. This forced exile is known today as the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nThese settlers were primarily members of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]], though due to the [[Second Great Awakening]], many of them had converted to [[Methodism]], and some had become [[Baptists]] before coming to what is now Indiana. The Congregational Church has subsequently gone through many divisions, and some factions, including those in Goshen, are now known as the [[Church of Christ]] and the [[United Church of Christ]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  When the New Englanders arrived in what is now Elkhart County there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. They laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:palmsundaytwintornadoes.jpg|thumb|right|This double tornado hit the Midway Trailer Court northwest of Goshen on U.S. 33, Palm Sunday, 1965.]]\nOn Palm Sunday, April 11, 1965, a [[1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak|large outbreak of tornadoes]] struck the Midwest.
