[[Advanced Front-Lighting System (AFS)]], static [[cornering light]], complemented by [[daytime running light]]s with [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]]. Sensors and software monitor the surroundings, traffic and weather conditions so that the system can activate the appropriate lighting function.\n* Opel Eye \u2013 This uses a camera at the top of the windscreen to monitor the area in front of the vehicle. Information from the camera is continuously analysed to identify road markings and traffic signs. Road markings are used as the basis of the first of Opel Eye's two functions: [[lane departure warning]]. Traffic signs are recognised and indicated to the driver in the second function: traffic sign memory. \nAt speeds above {{convert|60|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, Opel Eye warns the driver if the car is about to veer inadvertently out of the lane in which it is travelling. The system can detect road markings and, if they are sufficiently distinct, unmarked road edges. The Insignia was the first [[production car]] to feature a dual function frontal camera with [[traffic sign recognition]].\n\nDespite its global presence, the Opel Insignia has never been sold in Japan, as Opel had already withdrawn from the market in Japan before launching this model.\n\nDesign wise, the Insignia offers {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}} more knee room than the Vectra. The [[sedan (automobile)|saloon]] and [[fastback]] variants have the same {{convert|4.83|m|in|1|abbr=on}} length and [[wheelbase]] of {{convert|2.73|m|in|1|abbr=on}}.

The car officially premiered at the September [[Frankfurt Motor Show#2013|2013 Frankfurt Motor Show]], before going on sale later in 2013.\n\nThe new design includes a newly designed cockpit with a simplified control panel and two eight inch colour displays, a four way infotainment system via new a [[touchpad]] in the centre console, an eight-inch [[touchscreen]], steering wheel controls, [[voice command]], [[radar]] and camera based [[driver assistance]] and safety systems, such as full speed [[adaptive cruise control]] and [[imminent collision braking]], [[rear camera]], [[Lane departure warning system|lane change assistance]], [[blind spot alert]], and rear cross traffic alert.\n\nThe second generation Insignia was revealed in December 2016, and was reported to be renamed ''Insignia Grand Sport''.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Opel Insignia 2.0 Turbo Cosmo 4x4 2016.jpg|Opel Insignia 2.0 Turbo (Chile)\nFile:Opel Insignia facelift.jpg|Opel Insignia\nFile:2016 Vauxhall Insignia Design 1.4.jpg|Vauxhall Insignia (facelift)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Engines ===\n\n==== 2008\u20132013 ====\nFrom launch, the Insignia was offered with four petrol engines \u2013 a 1.6 L {{convert|115|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, 1.8 L {{convert|140|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, 2.0 L Turbo {{convert|220|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and a 2.8 L V6 with {{convert|260|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} \u2013 and three diesel engines (all derived from the Fiat/GM [[JTD engine]]) \u2013 all 2.0 litres with {{convert|110|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|130|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. In 2009, a 1.6 L Turbo petrol {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, the ecoFLEX diesels, and the OPC versions were introduced.\n\nFrom September 2010, the 2.0 CDTi diesel engine gained Adaptive 4x4 as an option. A '2.0 BiTurbo' CDTI, with {{convert|195|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, in development with Saab, was expected to begin production in 2010, but due to the sale of Saab, production was delayed and began production in 2012, as 2WD (FWD) and 4WD. All engines have a six speed [[manual transmission]] as standard, with some engines having an [[automatic transmission]] as an option.\n\nSince launch, all diesels have improved their emissions. In 2011, some engines gained [[Start-stop system|Start/Stop]], all diesel engines have this option, with more petrol engines expected to gain the technology in the future. A 1.4 Turbo {{convert|140|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, with S/S as standard, is available, replacing the 1.8, and the 2.0 Turbo was upgraded to {{convert|250|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} only with four wheel drive. The 2.0 Turbo with {{convert|220|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} remains as only FWD.\n\nIn 2009, a new range of ecoFLEX diesel engine offered same amount of power, but less CO<sub>2</sub>-emission (g/km) and fuel consumption. The 2.0 CDTI ecoFLEX with {{convert|130|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} have emission of only 114 CO<sub>2</sub>-emission (g/km), as well as a version with 2.0 CDTI 4x4. The {{convert|195|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} Bi turbo diesel engine has 129 CO<sub>2</sub>-emission (g/km).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|Petrol engine\n|- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\"\n!Model\n!Engine\n!Displacement\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Note\n!Year\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n|'''[[GM Family 0 engine#Turbo|1.4 Turbo]] S/S'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,364 cc||{{convert|140|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} @4,900\u20136000&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|200|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @1850-4,900&nbsp;rpm||||2011\u201313\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n|'''[[GM Family 1 engine#DCVCP|1.6 VVT]]'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,598&nbsp;cc||{{convert|115|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} @6,000&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|155|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} @4,000&nbsp;rpm||||2008\u201312\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n|'''[[GM Family 1 engine#Turbo|1.6 Turbo]]'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,598&nbsp;cc||{{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} @5,500&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|230|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @2,200\u20135,500&nbsp;rpm|| ||\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n|'''[[GM Family 1 engine#DCVCP|1.8 VVT]]'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,796&nbsp;cc||{{convert|140|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} @6,300&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|175|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} @3,800&nbsp;rpm||||\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n||'''[[GM Ecotec engine#LDK|2.0 Turbo]]'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,998&nbsp;cc||{{convert|220|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} @5,300&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @2,000-4000&nbsp;rpm|| ||2008\u201313\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n||'''[[GM Ecotec engine#LDK|2.0 Turbo 4x4]]'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,998&nbsp;cc||{{convert|220|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} @5,300&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @2,000-4000&nbsp;rpm|| ||2008\u201311\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n||'''[[GM Ecotec engine#LDK|2.0 Turbo 4x4]]'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,998&nbsp;cc||{{convert|250|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} @5,300&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|400|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @2,400\u20133,600&nbsp;rpm|| ||2011\u201313\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n||'''[[GM High Feature engine#LP9 Turbo|2.8T]] 4x4'''||[[V6]]||2,792&nbsp;cc||{{convert|260|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} @5,500&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @1,900\u20134500&nbsp;rpm|| ||2008\u201313\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n||'''[[GM High Feature engine#LP9 Turbo|2.8T]] 4x4'''||[[V6]]||2,792&nbsp;cc||{{convert|325|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} @5,500&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|435|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} @5,500&nbsp;rpm||[[Opel Performance Center|OPC]]/[[VXR]]||2009\u201313\n|-\n!colspan=10|Diesel engine\n|- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\"\n!Model\n!Engine\n!Displacement\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Note\n!Year\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n||'''[[GM Family B engine|2.0 CDTI]]'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,956&nbsp;cc||{{convert|110|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} @4,000&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|260|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @1,750\u20132500&nbsp;rpm||N/A in UK||\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n||'''2.0 CDTI'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,956&nbsp;cc||{{convert|130|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} @4,000&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|300|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @1,750\u20132500&nbsp;rpm|| ||\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n||'''2.0 CDTI'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,956&nbsp;cc||{{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} @4,000&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @1,750\u20132500&nbsp;rpm|| ||\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n||'''2.0 CDTI 4x4'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,956&nbsp;cc||{{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} @4,000&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @1,750\u20132500&nbsp;rpm|| ||2010\u201313\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n||'''2.0 CDTI Bi-Turbo'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,956&nbsp;cc||{{convert|195|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}@4,000&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|400|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @1,750\u20132500&nbsp;rpm|| ||2012\u201313\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n||'''2.0 CDTI Bi-Turbo 4x4'''||[[straight-4|I4]]||1,956&nbsp;cc||{{convert|195|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}@4,000&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|400|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @1,750\u20132500&nbsp;rpm|| ||2012\u201313\n|}\n\n==== 2013\u20132017 ====\nAlongside the facelift of 2013 came a new range of engines \u2013 some existing, some tweaked, and some brand new.

It is the first iteration of the fifth generation [[Holden Commodore]] platform, which is based on the second generation Opel Insignia. The range includes five door [[liftback]] sedan and five door [[station wagon]] bodystyles.\n\nHolden previously sold the first generation Insignia under the Opel brand (Opel Insignia) in 2012 and 2013,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/opel-insignia-used-review-2012-2013-46491|title=Used Opel Insignia review: 2012-2013|website=CarsGuide|access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref> as well as under the Holden brand (Holden Insignia) from 2015 to 2017. It is the first Holden Commodore model to be manufactured outside of Australia, following the closure of Holden's Australian car manufacturing facilities at [[Elizabeth, South Australia]] and [[Fishermans Bend, Victoria]] on Friday 20 October 2017.\n\nIt is the first Commodore in thirty years to come with a [[four-cylinder engine]] as standard, and controversially, the first in its forty year production not to have a [[V8 engine|V8]] powertrain option. Holden corporate made the decision to discontinue Australian manufacturing of the Holden Commodore due to falling sales and losses.\n\nThe ZB Commodore has proven to be unpopular resulting in cuts to the production plant<ref>https://www.caradvice.com.au/697503/holden-commodore-equinox-halted/</ref> and the lowest months on record since the VB Commodore which was released in 1978.<ref>https://www.caradvice.com.au/811407/holden-record-low/</ref> November 2019 was the lowest month recorded with only 309 Commodores sold<ref>https://performancedrive.com.au/australian-vehicle-sales-for-november-2019-vfacts-0415/</ref>\n\nOn 10 December 2019, it was announced that the ZB Commodore, and the Commodore nameplate, will be discontinued at the end of 2020, citing worsening sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autocar.co.nz/autocar-news-app/holden-just-killed-the-commodore|title=Holden just killed the Commodore|website=www.autocar.co.nz|language=en|access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Development ====\nDevelopment for the ZB Commodore started in 2012, with Holden helping Opel design and develop the next generation Insignia, catering it to Australian conditions.\n\nOnce the car was ready, prototypes were sent to Australia for testing. Holden completed over 100,000&nbsp;km of testing, with engineers bracing the cars to withstand local roads and make it feel similar to previous Commodore generations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whichcar.com.au/car-news/2018-holden-zb-commodore-testing-reaches-100000km-milestone|title=2018 Holden ZB Commodore testing reaches 100,000km milestone|website=WhichCar|language=en|access-date=6 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Safety ====\nAkin to its VF Commodore predecessor, the ZB achieved five stars in the [[Australian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]] safety ratings. Originally, the ZB ANCAP rating was awarded based on the [[Euro NCAP]] test of a 1.6 litre model which is not sold in Australia.<ref>https://www.motoring.com.au/ancap-to-retest-new-holden-commodore-111256/</ref> ANCAP conducted an audit test on specification of Australia V6 and confirmed it's rating.<ref>https://www.goauto.com.au/news/general-news/safety/ancap-re-tests-holden-commodore/2018-05-09/72513.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"| ANCAP Test Results\n|-\n| Star rating:\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"| [[File:Star full.svg|11px|link=]] [[File:Star full.svg|11px|link=]] [[File:Star full.svg|11px|link=]] [[File:Star full.svg|11px|link=]] [[File:Star full.svg|11px|link=]]\n|-\n!

[[Front-wheel drive]] and [[all-wheel drive]] are available across the liftback and wagon body styles.\n\n==== Models ====\nCompared to the VF Commodore, Holden rearranged the specification levels with the Calais variants only surviving the cull, having been introduced with the VK Series of 1984 as the luxury focused models. Various price cuts were made and [[Station wagon|wagon]] variants are more expensive.\n\n'''Commodore LT'''\n[[File:2018 Holden Commodore (ZB MY18) LT Tourer (2018-10-25).jpg|thumb|right|Commodore LT Sportwagon]]\nThe LT is the new entry level Commodore, replacing the previous generation's Evoke model, which is also $3,935 cheaper than the predecessor's drive away price. It features a front wheel drive 2.0L Turbo four cylinder engine with a nine speed automatic, or an optional 2.0L diesel, with an eight speed automatic. \n\nIt comes with 17\" alloy wheels, Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), Lane Keep Assist, a 7\" MyLink system with Apple CarPlay & Android Auto and Passive Entry & Push Button Start as standard. The model is available as liftback or wagon.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !! Engine !! Displacement !! Power !! Torque !! Transmission !! Pricing (Liftback) !!

It also features more safety features, including Blind Zone Alert and Rear Cross Traffic Alert. The RS has two drivetrain options of a front wheel drive 2.0L Turbo four cylinder engine, with a nine speed Automatic or an All Wheel Drive 3.6L V6 (only available on the Liftback). It comes with 18\" alloy wheels. The model is available as liftback or wagon.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !! Engine !! Displacement !! Power !! Torque !! Transmission !!

The VXR nameplate was originally used for the British Vauxhall VXR. It features 20\" alloy wheels, sportier lavishings and leather seats with a massage function. Safety features include a 360 degree camera and Continuous Damping Control Suspension. It is only available in liftback with the V6 powertrain.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !! Engine !!

Powered by the same [[V8 engine]] as used in the VF, a turbo charged V6 engine was under development for use in [[2019 Supercars Championship|2019]], however the project was cancelled in April 2018 amid engineering concerns that the V6 would not be competitive.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2017/06/09/t8-retains-v8-phased-gen-ii-implementation/|title=T8 retains V8 in phased Gen II implementation|work=[[Speedcafe]]|date=9 June 2017}}</ref><ref>[https://www.speedcafe.com/2018/04/06/holden-suspends-v6-turbo-development/ Holden suspends V6 turbo development] ''Speedcafe'' 6 April 2018</ref>\n\n==== Sales ====\nSales of the new Commodore commenced in February 2018. The ZB is the first Commodore produced outside of Australia since the nameplates induction in 1978, leading to much public backlash.\n\nConsumer uptake and acceptance have been the lowest for any Commodore branded vehicle in the history of Holden manufacturing, however, this has also come at the same time as the nameplate has shifted market segment and competition, with the ZB outperforming all but the [[Toyota Camry]] in the Medium/Large segment, including the [[Mazda6]] and [[Ford Mondeo]].<ref>https://www.whichcar.com.au/news/zb-commodore-segment-success-overall-sales-decline</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align: center\"\n!\n! width=\"40\" | Jan\n! width=\"40\" | Feb\n! width=\"40\" | Mar\n! width=\"40\" | Apr\n! width=\"40\" | May\n! width=\"40\" | Jun\n! width=\"40\" | Jul\n! width=\"40\" | Aug\n! width=\"40\" | Sep\n! width=\"40\" | Oct\n! width=\"40\" | Nov\n! width=\"40\" | Dec\n! width=\"60\" | Total\n|-\n! 2018\n| colspan=\"1\" {{n/a}}\n| 363\n| 516\n| 473 \n| 885\n| 946\n| 516\n| 635\n| 672\n| 663\n| 701\n|381\n! 6,751\n|-\n! 2019\n| 393\n| 569\n| 406\n| 629\n| 670\n| 550\n| 460\n| 509\n| 419\n| 469\n| 309\n|\n! 5,373\n|}\n\n==== Future Developments ====\nWhen the decision was made to cease vehicle production in Australia and source the ZB Commodore from Europe, Opel and Vauxhall were still subsidiaries of GM.

[[Advanced Front-Lighting System (AFS)]], static [[cornering light]], complemented by [[daytime running light]]s with [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]].

Information from the camera is continuously analysed to identify road markings and traffic signs. Road markings are used as the basis of the first of Opel Eye's two functions: [[lane departure warning]]. Traffic signs are recognised and indicated to the driver in the second function: traffic sign memory. \nAt speeds above {{convert|60|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, Opel Eye warns the driver if the car is about to veer inadvertently out of the lane in which it is travelling.

A '2.0 BiTurbo' CDTI, with {{convert|195|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, in development with Saab, was expected to begin production in 2010, but due to the sale of Saab, production was delayed and began production in 2012, as 2WD (FWD) and 4WD. All engines have a six speed [[manual transmission]] as standard, with some engines having an [[automatic transmission]] as an option.\n\nSince launch, all diesels have improved their emissions. In 2011, some engines gained [[Start-stop system|Start/Stop]], all diesel engines have this option, with more petrol engines expected to gain the technology in the future. A 1.4 Turbo {{convert|140|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, with S/S as standard, is available, replacing the 1.8, and the 2.0 Turbo was upgraded to {{convert|250|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} only with four wheel drive.

It is the first iteration of the fifth generation [[Holden Commodore]] platform, which is based on the second generation Opel Insignia. The range includes five door [[liftback]] sedan and five door [[station wagon]] bodystyles.\n\nHolden previously sold the first generation Insignia under the Opel brand (Opel Insignia) in 2012 and 2013,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/opel-insignia-used-review-2012-2013-46491|title=Used Opel Insignia review: 2012-2013|website=CarsGuide|access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref> as well as under the Holden brand (Holden Insignia) from 2015 to 2017. It is the first Holden Commodore model to be manufactured outside of Australia, following the closure of Holden's Australian car manufacturing facilities at [[Elizabeth, South Australia]] and [[Fishermans Bend, Victoria]] on Friday 20 October 2017.\n\nIt is the first Commodore in thirty years to come with a [[four-cylinder engine]] as standard, and controversially, the first in its forty year production not to have a [[V8 engine|V8]] powertrain option. Holden corporate made the decision to discontinue Australian manufacturing of the Holden Commodore due to falling sales and losses.\n\nThe ZB Commodore has proven to be unpopular resulting in cuts to the production plant<ref>https://www.caradvice.com.au/697503/holden-commodore-equinox-halted/</ref> and the lowest months on record since the VB Commodore which was released in 1978.<ref>https://www.caradvice.com.au/811407/holden-record-low/</ref> November 2019 was the lowest month recorded with only 309 Commodores sold<ref>https://performancedrive.com.au/australian-vehicle-sales-for-november-2019-vfacts-0415/</ref>\n\nOn 10 December 2019, it was announced that the ZB Commodore, and the Commodore nameplate, will be discontinued at the end of 2020, citing worsening sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autocar.co.nz/autocar-news-app/holden-just-killed-the-commodore|title=Holden just killed the Commodore|website=www.autocar.co.nz|language=en|access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Development ====\nDevelopment for the ZB Commodore started in 2012, with Holden helping Opel design and develop the next generation Insignia, catering it to Australian conditions.\n\nOnce the car was ready, prototypes were sent to Australia for testing. Holden completed over 100,000&nbsp;km of testing, with engineers bracing the cars to withstand local roads and make it feel similar to previous Commodore generations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whichcar.com.au/car-news/2018-holden-zb-commodore-testing-reaches-100000km-milestone|title=2018 Holden ZB Commodore testing reaches 100,000km milestone|website=WhichCar|language=en|access-date=6 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Safety ====\nAkin to its VF Commodore predecessor, the ZB achieved five stars in the [[Australian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]] safety ratings. Originally, the ZB ANCAP rating was awarded based on the [[Euro NCAP]] test of a 1.6 litre model which is not sold in Australia.<ref>https://www.motoring.com.au/ancap-to-retest-new-holden-commodore-111256/</ref> ANCAP conducted an audit test on specification of Australia V6 and confirmed it's rating.<ref>https://www.goauto.com.au/news/general-news/safety/ancap-re-tests-holden-commodore/2018-05-09/72513.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"| ANCAP Test Results\n|-\n| Star rating:\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"| [[File:Star full.svg|11px|link=]] [[File:Star full.svg|11px|link=]] [[File:Star full.svg|11px|link=]] [[File:Star full.svg|11px|link=]] [[File:Star full.svg|11px|link=]]\n|-\n!

[[Front-wheel drive]] and [[all-wheel drive]] are available across the liftback and wagon body styles.\n\n==== Models ====\nCompared to the VF Commodore, Holden rearranged the specification levels with the Calais variants only surviving the cull, having been introduced with the VK Series of 1984 as the luxury focused models. Various price cuts were made and [[Station wagon|wagon]] variants are more expensive.\n\n'''Commodore LT'''\n[[File:2018 Holden Commodore (ZB MY18) LT Tourer (2018-10-25).jpg|thumb|right|Commodore LT Sportwagon]]\nThe LT is the new entry level Commodore, replacing the previous generation's Evoke model, which is also $3,935 cheaper than the predecessor's drive away price. It features a front wheel drive 2.0L Turbo four cylinder engine with a nine speed automatic, or an optional 2.0L diesel, with an eight speed automatic. \n\nIt comes with 17\" alloy wheels, Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), Lane Keep Assist, a 7\" MyLink system with Apple CarPlay & Android Auto and Passive Entry & Push Button Start as standard. The model is available as liftback or wagon.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !! Engine !! Displacement !! Power !! Torque !! Transmission !! Pricing (Liftback) !!

It also features more safety features, including Blind Zone Alert and Rear Cross Traffic Alert. The RS has two drivetrain options of a front wheel drive 2.0L Turbo four cylinder engine, with a nine speed Automatic or an All Wheel Drive 3.6L V6 (only available on the Liftback). It comes with 18\" alloy wheels. The model is available as liftback or wagon.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !! Engine !! Displacement !! Power !! Torque !! Transmission !!

The VXR nameplate was originally used for the British Vauxhall VXR. It features 20\" alloy wheels, sportier lavishings and leather seats with a massage function. Safety features include a 360 degree camera and Continuous Damping Control Suspension. It is only available in liftback with the V6 powertrain.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !! Engine !!

Powered by the same [[V8 engine]] as used in the VF, a turbo charged V6 engine was under development for use in [[2019 Supercars Championship|2019]], however the project was cancelled in April 2018 amid engineering concerns that the V6 would not be competitive.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2017/06/09/t8-retains-v8-phased-gen-ii-implementation/|title=T8 retains V8 in phased Gen II implementation|work=[[Speedcafe]]|date=9 June 2017}}</ref><ref>[https://www.speedcafe.com/2018/04/06/holden-suspends-v6-turbo-development/ Holden suspends V6 turbo development] ''Speedcafe'' 6 April 2018</ref>\n\n==== Sales ====\nSales of the new Commodore commenced in February 2018. The ZB is the first Commodore produced outside of Australia since the nameplates induction in 1978, leading to much public backlash.\n\nConsumer uptake and acceptance have been the lowest for any Commodore branded vehicle in the history of Holden manufacturing, however, this has also come at the same time as the nameplate has shifted market segment and competition, with the ZB outperforming all but the [[Toyota Camry]] in the Medium/Large segment, including the [[Mazda6]] and [[Ford Mondeo]].<ref>https://www.whichcar.com.au/news/zb-commodore-segment-success-overall-sales-decline</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align: center\"\n!\n! width=\"40\" | Jan\n! width=\"40\" | Feb\n! width=\"40\" | Mar\n! width=\"40\" | Apr\n! width=\"40\" | May\n! width=\"40\" | Jun\n! width=\"40\" | Jul\n! width=\"40\" | Aug\n! width=\"40\" | Sep\n! width=\"40\" | Oct\n! width=\"40\" | Nov\n! width=\"40\" | Dec\n! width=\"60\" | Total\n|-\n! 2018\n| colspan=\"1\" {{n/a}}\n| 363\n| 516\n| 473 \n| 885\n| 946\n| 516\n| 635\n| 672\n| 663\n| 701\n|381\n! 6,751\n|-\n! 2019\n| 393\n| 569\n| 406\n| 629\n| 670\n| 550\n| 460\n| 509\n| 419\n| 469\n| 309\n|\n! 5,373\n|}\n\n==== Future Developments ====\nWhen the decision was made to cease vehicle production in Australia and source the ZB Commodore from Europe, Opel and Vauxhall were still subsidiaries of GM.

The solid body shows the places where the electron's [[probability density function|probability density]] is above a certain value (here 0.02 [[nanometre|nm]]<sup>\u22123</sup>): this is calculated from the probability amplitude. The [[hue]] on the colored surface shows the [[argument (complex analysis)|complex phase]] of the wave function.]]\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], a '''probability amplitude''' is a [[complex number]] used in describing the behaviour of systems. The [[absolute value|modulus]] [[square (algebra)|squared]] of this quantity represents a [[probability]] or [[probability density function|probability density]].\n\nProbability amplitudes provide a relationship between the [[wave function]] (or, more generally, of a [[quantum state]] vector) of a system and the results of observations of that system, a link first proposed by [[Max Born]]. Interpretation of values of a wave function as the probability amplitude is a pillar of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. In fact, the properties of the space of wave functions were being used to make physical predictions (such as [[atomic emission spectroscopy|emissions from atoms]] being at certain discrete energies) before any physical interpretation of a particular function was offered. Born was awarded half of the 1954 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this understanding (see [[#References|References]]), and the probability thus calculated is sometimes called the \"Born probability\". These probabilistic concepts, namely the probability density and [[quantum measurement]]s, were vigorously contested at the time by the original physicists working on the theory, such as [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]. It is the source of the mysterious consequences and philosophical difficulties in the [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]\u2014topics that continue to be debated even today.\n\n==Overview==\n{{main|Born rule}}\n\n===Physical===\nNeglecting some technical complexities, the problem of [[quantum measurement]] is the behaviour of a quantum state, for which the value of the [[observable]] {{mvar|Q}} to be measured is [[uncertainty principle|uncertain]]. Such a state is thought to be a [[quantum superposition|coherent superposition]] of the observable's ''[[eigenstate]]s'', states on which the value of the observable is uniquely defined, for different possible values of the observable.\n\nWhen a measurement of {{mvar|Q}} is made, the system (under the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]) [[state vector reduction|''jumps'' to one of the eigenstates]], returning the eigenvalue belonging to that eigenstate. The system may always be described by a [[linear combination]] or [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of these eigenstates with unequal [[weight function|\"weights\"]]. Intuitively it is clear that eigenstates with heavier \"weights\" are more \"likely\" to be produced. Indeed, which of the above eigenstates the system jumps to is given by a probabilistic law: the probability of the system jumping to the state is proportional to the absolute value of the corresponding numerical weight squared. These numerical weights are called probability amplitudes, and this relationship used to calculate probabilities from given pure quantum states (such as wave functions) is called the [[Born rule]]. \n\nClearly, the sum of the probabilities, which equals the sum of the absolute squares of the probability amplitudes, must equal 1. This is the [[#Normalization|normalization (see below)]] requirement.\n\nIf the system is known to be in some eigenstate of {{mvar|Q}} (e.g. after an observation of the corresponding eigenvalue of {{mvar|Q}}) the probability of observing that eigenvalue becomes equal to 1 (certain) for all subsequent measurements of {{mvar|Q}} (so long as no other important forces act between the measurements). In other words the probability amplitudes are zero for all the other eigenstates, and remain zero for the future measurements. If the set of eigenstates to which the system can jump upon measurement of {{mvar|Q}} is the same as the set of eigenstates for measurement of {{mvar|R}}, then subsequent measurements of either {{mvar|Q}} or {{mvar|R}} always produce the same values with probability of 1, no matter the order in which they are applied. The probability amplitudes are unaffected by either measurement, and the observables are said to [[commutator|commute]].\n\nBy contrast, if the eigenstates of {{mvar|Q}} and {{mvar|R}} are different, then measurement of {{mvar|R}} produces a jump to a state that is not an eigenstate of {{mvar|Q}}. Therefore, if the system is known to be in some an eigenstate of {{mvar|Q}} (all probability amplitudes zero except for one eigenstate), then when {{mvar|R}} is observed the probability amplitudes are changed. A second, subsequent observation of {{mvar|Q}} no longer certainly produces the eigenvalue corresponding to the starting state. In other words, the probability amplitudes for the second measurement of {{mvar|Q}} depend on whether it comes before or after a measurement of {{mvar|R}}, and the two observables [[commutator|do not commute]].\n\n===Mathematical===\n<!-- Note: \u03a8\u03c8 are encoded in named entities because they are nearly homoglyphic (although with different vertical position) in some fonts, so one can easily made a mistake during editing. -->\nIn a formal setup, any [[quantum system|system in quantum mechanics]] is described by a state, which is a [[vector space|vector]] {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}}, residing in an abstract [[complex number|complex]] vector space, called a [[Hilbert space]]. It may be either infinite- or finite-[[dimension (vector space)|dimensional]]. A usual presentation of that Hilbert space is a special [[function space]], called [[L2 space|{{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}}]], on certain set {{mvar|X}}, that is either some [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] or a discrete set.\n\nFor a [[measurable function]] <math>\\psi</math>, the condition <math>\\psi \\in L^2(X)</math> specifies that a finitely bounded integral must apply:\n: <math>\\int\\limits_X |\\psi(x)|^2\\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu(x) < \\infty ;</math>\nthis [[integral]] defines the square of the [[normed vector space|norm]] of {{mvar|&psi;}}. If that norm is equal to {{num|1}}, then\n: <math>\\int\\limits_X |\\psi(x)|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(x) = 1.</math>\nIt actually means that any element of {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}} of the norm 1 defines a [[probability measure]] on {{mvar|X}} and a non-negative [[real number|real]] expression {{math|{{abs|''&psi;''(''x'')}}<sup>2</sup>}} defines its [[Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative]] with respect to the standard measure {{mvar|\u03bc}}.\n\n{{anchor|atomic}}If the standard measure {{mvar|\u03bc}} on {{mvar|X}} is [[non-atomic measure|non-atomic]], such as the [[Lebesgue measure]] on the [[real line]], or on [[three-dimensional space]], or similar measures on [[manifold]]s, then a [[real-valued function]] {{math|{{abs|''&psi;''(''x'')}}<sup>2</sup>}} is called a ''probability density''; see details [[#Wave functions and probabilities|below]]. If the standard measure on {{mvar|X}} consists of [[atom (measure theory)|atoms]] only (we shall call such sets {{mvar|X}} ''discrete''), and specifies the measure of any {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}} equal to {{num|1}},<ref>The case of an atomic measure on {{mvar|X}} with {{math|''\u03bc''({''x''}) \u2260 1}} is not interesting, because such {{mvar|x}} that {{math|1=''\u03bc''({''x''}) = 0}} are unused by {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}} and can be dropped, whereas for {{mvar|x}} of positive measures the value of {{math|''\u03bc''({''x''})}} is virtually the question of rescaling of {{math|''&psi;''(''x'')}}. Due to this trivial fix this case was hardly ever considered by physicists.</ref> then an integral over {{mvar|X}} is simply a [[summation|sum]]<ref>If {{mvar|X}} is [[countable set|countable]], then an integral is the sum of an [[infinite series]].</ref> and {{math|{{abs|''&psi;''(''x'')}}<sup>2</sup>}} defines the value of the probability measure on the set {{math|{''x''}}}, in other words, the [[probability]] that the quantum system is in the state {{mvar|x}}. How amplitudes and the vector are related can be understood with the [[standard basis]] of {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}}, elements of which will be denoted by {{math|{{ket|''x''}}}} or {{math|{{bra|''x''}}}} (see [[bra\u2013ket notation]] for the angle bracket notation). In this basis\n:<math> \\psi (x) = \\langle x|\\Psi \\rangle</math>\nspecifies the coordinate presentation of an abstract vector {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}}.\n\nMathematically, many {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} presentations of the system's Hilbert space can exist. We shall consider not an arbitrary one, but a {{visible anchor|convenient}} one for the observable {{mvar|Q}} in question. A convenient configuration space {{mvar|X}} is such that each point {{mvar|x}} produces some unique value of {{mvar|Q}}. For discrete {{mvar|X}} it means that all elements of the standard basis are [[eigenvector]]s of {{mvar|Q}}. In other words, {{mvar|Q}} shall be [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] in that basis. Then <math> \\psi (x)</math> is the \"probability amplitude\" for the eigenstate {{math|{{bra|''x''}}}}. If it corresponds to a non-[[degenerate energy levels|degenerate]] eigenvalue of {{mvar|Q}}, then <math> |\\psi (x)|^2</math> gives the probability of the corresponding value of {{mvar|Q}} for the initial state {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}}.\n\nFor non-discrete {{mvar|X}} there may not be such states as {{math|{{bra|''x''}}}} in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}}, but the decomposition is in some sense possible; see [[spectral theory]] and [[self-adjoint operator#Spectral theorem|Spectral theorem]] for accurate explanation.\n\n==Wave functions and probabilities==<!-- caution: an internal #-link -->\nIf the configuration space {{mvar|X}} is continuous (something like the [[real line]] or Euclidean space, see [[#atomic|above]]), then there are no valid quantum states corresponding to particular {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}, and the probability that the system is \"in the state {{mvar|x}}\" will always [[almost never|be zero]]. An archetypical example of this is the {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''R''')}} space constructed with 1-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]]; it is used to study a motion in [[one-dimensional space|one dimension]]. This presentation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space corresponds to the spectral decomposition of the [[position operator|coordinate operator]]: {{math|1={{langle}}''x''\u2009[[operator (physics)|{{pipe}}\u2009''Q''\u2009{{pipe}}]]\u2009&Psi;{{rangle}} = ''x''&sdot;{{bra-ket|''x''\u2009|\u2009&Psi;}}, ''x'' \u2208 '''R'''}} in this example. Although there are no such vectors as {{math|{{bra|''x''\u2009}}}}, strictly speaking, the expression {{math|{{bra-ket|''x''\u2009|\u2009&Psi;}}}} can be made meaningful, for instance, with spectral theory.\n\nGenerally, it is the case when the [[motion (physics)|motion]] of a particle is described [[position and momentum space|in the position space]], where the corresponding probability amplitude function {{mvar|&psi;}} is the [[wave function]].\n\nIf the function {{math|''&psi;'' \u2208 ''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X''), \u2016''&psi;''\u2016 {{=}} 1}} represents the [[quantum state]] vector {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}}, then the real expression {{math|{{abs|''&psi;''(''x'')}}<sup>2</sup>}}, that depends on {{mvar|x}}, forms a [[probability density function]] of the given state. The difference of a ''density function'' from simply a numerical probability means that one should integrate this modulus-squared function over some (small) domains in {{mvar|X}} to obtain probability values \u2013 as was stated above, the system can't be in some state {{mvar|x}} with a positive probability. It gives to both amplitude and density function a [[dimension of a physical quantity|physical dimension]], unlike a dimensionless probability. For example, for a [[three-dimensional space|3-dimensional]] wave function, the amplitude has the dimension [L<sup>\u22123/2</sup>], where L is length.\n\nNote that for both continuous and infinite discrete cases not ''every'' measurable, or even [[smooth function]] (i.e. a possible wave function) defines an element of {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}}; see [[Normalisation]] below.\n\n==Discrete amplitudes==\nWhen the set {{mvar|X}} is discrete (see [[#atomic|above]]), vectors {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}} represented with the Hilbert space {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}} are just [[column vector]]s composed of \"amplitudes\" and [[indexed family|indexed]] by {{mvar|X}}.\n<!-- \nShould {{mvar|X}} in this case be called a \u201cconfiguration space\u201d?\n --Incnis Mrsi -->\nThese are sometimes referred to as wave functions of a discrete variable {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}. Discrete dynamical variables are used in such problems as a [[Particle in a box|particle in an idealized reflective box]] and [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]. Components of the vector will be denoted by {{math|''&psi;''(''x'')}} for uniformity with the previous case; there may be either finite of infinite number of components depending on the Hilbert space.\nIn this case, if the vector {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}} has the norm 1, then {{math|{{abs|''&psi;''(''x'')}}<sup>2</sup>}} is just the probability that the quantum system resides in the state {{mvar|x}}. It defines a [[discrete probability distribution]] on {{mvar|X}}.\n\n{{math|1={{abs|''&psi;''(''x'')}} = 1}} if and only if {{math|{{ket|''x''}}}} is [[ray (quantum theory)|the same quantum state]] as {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}}. {{math|1=''&psi;''(''x'') = 0}} if and only if {{math|{{ket|''x''}}}} and {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}} are orthogonal (see [[inner product space]]). Otherwise the modulus of {{math|''&psi;''(''x'')}} is between 0 and 1.\n\nA discrete probability amplitude may be considered as a [[fundamental frequency]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} in the Probability Frequency domain ([[spherical harmonics]]) for the purposes of simplifying [[M-theory]] transformation calculations.\n\n==A basic example==\n\nTake the simplest meaningful example of the discrete case: a quantum system that can be in [[two-state quantum system|two possible states]]: for example, the [[light polarization|polarization]] of a [[photon]]. When the polarization is measured, it could be the horizontal state {{math|{{ket|\u2009''H''\u2009}}}}, or the vertical state {{math|{{ket|\u2009''V''\u2009}}}}. Until its polarization is measured the photon can be in a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of both these states, so its state {{math|[[ket vector|{{ket|''&psi;''}}]]}} could be written as:\n\n:<math>| \\psi \\rangle = \\alpha |H \\rangle + \\beta |V\\rangle,\\,</math>\n\nThe probability amplitudes of {{math|{{ket|''&psi;''}}}} for the states {{math|{{ket|\u2009''H''\u2009}}}} and {{math|{{ket|\u2009''V''\u2009}}}} are {{mvar|\u03b1}} and {{mvar|\u03b2}} respectively. When the photon's polarization is measured, the resulting state is either horizontal or vertical. But in a random experiment, the probability of being horizontally polarized is {{math|''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>}}, and the probability of being vertically polarized is {{math|''\u03b2''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\nTherefore, a photon in a state <math>| \\psi \\rangle = \\sqrt{1\\over 3} |H\\rangle - i \\sqrt{2\\over 3}|V \\rangle</math> would have a probability of 1/3 to come out horizontally polarized, and a probability of 2/3 to come out vertically polarized when an [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] of measurements are made. The order of such results, is, however, completely random.\n\n==Normalization==<!-- caution: an internal #-link -->\n{{Expand section|explain the link between normalization and the [[conditional probability]]|small=no|date=January 2014}}\nIn the example above, the measurement must give either {{math|{{ket|\u2009''H''\u2009}}}} or {{math|{{ket|\u2009''V''\u2009}}}}, so the total probability of measuring {{math|{{ket|\u2009''H''\u2009}}}} or {{math|{{ket|\u2009''V''\u2009}}}} must be 1. This leads to a constraint that {{math|1=''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03b2''<sup>2</sup> = 1}}; more generally '''the sum of the squared moduli of the probability amplitudes of all the possible states is equal to one'''. If to understand \"all the possible states\" as an [[orthonormal basis]], that makes sense in the discrete case, then this condition is the same as the norm-1 condition explained [[#Mathematical|above]].\n\nOne can always divide any non-zero element of a Hilbert space by its norm and obtain a ''normalized'' state vector. Not every wave function belongs to the Hilbert space {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}}, though. Wave functions that fulfill this constraint are called [[normalizable wave function|normalizable]].\n\nThe [[Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation]], describing states of quantum particles, has solutions that describe a system and determine precisely how the state [[time evolution operator|changes with time]]. Suppose a [[wavefunction]] {{math|''&psi;''<sub>0</sub>('''x''',\u2009''t'')}} is a solution of the wave equation, giving a description of the particle (position {{math|'''x'''}}, for time {{math|''t''}}).  If the wavefunction is [[square integrable]], ''i.e.''\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf R^n} |\\psi_0(\\mathbf x, t_0)|^2\\, \\mathrm{d\\mathbf x} = a^2 < \\infty</math>\nfor some {{math|''t''<sub>0</sub>}}, then {{math|''&psi;'' {{=}} ''&psi;''<sub>0</sub>/''a''}} is called the [[normalized wavefunction]].  Under the standard [[Copenhagen interpretation]], the normalized wavefunction gives probability amplitudes for the position of the particle. Hence, at a given time {{math|''t''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''\u03c1''('''x''') {{=}} {{abs|''&psi;''('''x''',\u2009''t''<sub>0</sub>)}}<sup>2</sup>}} is the [[probability density function]] of the particle's position.  Thus the probability that the particle is in the volume {{math|''V''}} at {{math|''t''<sub>0</sub>}} is\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}(V)=\\int_V \\rho(\\mathbf {x})\\, \\mathrm{d\\mathbf {x}} = \\int_V |\\psi(\\mathbf {x}, t_0)|^2\\, \\mathrm{d\\mathbf {x}}.</math>\nNote that if any solution {{math|''&psi;''<sub>0</sub>}} to the wave equation is normalisable at some time {{math|''t''<sub>0</sub>}}, then the {{mvar|\u03c8}} defined above is always normalised, so that\n:<math>\\rho_t(\\mathbf x)=\\left |\\psi(\\mathbf x, t)\\right |^2 = \\left|\\frac{\\psi_0(\\mathbf x, t)}{a}\\right|^2</math>\nis always a probability density function for all {{math|''t''}}. This is key to understanding the importance of this interpretation, because for a given the particle's constant [[mass]], initial {{math|''&psi;''('''x''',\u20090)}} and the [[potential energy|potential]], the [[Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation|Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] fully determines subsequent wavefunction, and the above then gives probabilities of locations of the particle at all subsequent times.\n\n==The laws of calculating probabilities of events==\n'''A'''. Provided a system evolves naturally (which under the Copenhagen interpretation means that the system is not subjected to measurement), the following laws apply:\n\n#The probability (or the density of probability in position/momentum space) of an event to occur is the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitude for the event: <math>P=|\\phi|^2</math>.\n#If there are several [[mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]], indistinguishable alternatives in which an event might occur (or, in realistic interpretations of wavefunction, several wavefunctions exist for a space-time event), the probability amplitudes of all these possibilities add to give the probability amplitude for that event: <math>\\phi=\\sum_i\\phi_i; P=|\\phi|^2=\\left|\\sum_i\\phi_i\\right|^2</math>.\n#If, for any alternative, there is a succession of sub-events, then the probability amplitude for that alternative is the product of the probability amplitude for each sub-event: <math>\\phi_{APB}=\\phi_{AP}\\phi_{PB}</math>.\n#Non-entangled states of a composite quantum system have amplitudes equal to the product of the amplitudes of the states of constituent systems: <math>\\phi_{\\rm{system}} (\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma,\\delta,\\ldots)=\\phi_1(\\alpha)\\phi_2(\\beta)\\phi_3(\\gamma)\\phi_4(\\delta)\\ldots</math>. See the [[#Composite systems]] section for more information.\nLaw 2 is analogous to the [[probability axioms|addition law of probability]], only the probability being substituted by the probability amplitude. Similarly, Law 4 is analogous to the multiplication law of probability for independent events; note that it fails for [[quantum entanglement|entangled states]].\n\n'''B'''. When an experiment is performed to decide between the several alternatives, the same laws hold true for the corresponding probabilities: <math>P=\\sum_i|\\phi_i|^2</math>.\n\nProvided one knows the probability amplitudes for events associated with an experiment, the above laws provide a complete description of quantum systems in terms of probabilities.\n\nThe above laws give way to the [[path integral formulation|path integral formulation of quantum mechanics]], in the formalism developed by the celebrated theoretical physicist [[Richard Feynman]]. This approach to quantum mechanics forms the stepping-stone to the path integral approach to [[quantum field theory]].\n\n==In the context of the double-slit experiment==\n{{main|Double-slit experiment}}\nProbability amplitudes have special significance because they act in quantum mechanics as the equivalent of conventional probabilities, with many analogous laws, as described above. For example, in the classic [[double-slit experiment]], electrons are fired randomly at two slits, and the probability distribution of detecting electrons at all parts on a large screen placed behind the slits, is questioned. An intuitive answer is that {{math|'''P'''(through either slit) {{=}} '''P'''(through first slit) + '''P'''(through second slit)}}, where {{math|'''P'''(event)}} is the probability of that event. This is obvious if one assumes that an electron passes through either slit. When nature does not have a way to distinguish which slit the electron has gone through (a much more stringent condition than simply \"it is not observed\"), the observed probability distribution on the screen reflects the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]] that is common with light waves. If one assumes the above law to be true, then this pattern cannot be explained. The particles cannot be said to go through either slit and the simple explanation does not work. The correct explanation is, however, by the association of probability amplitudes to each event. This is an example of the case A as described in the previous article. The complex amplitudes which represent the electron passing each slit ({{math|''&psi;''<sub>first</sub>}} and {{math|''&psi;''<sub>second</sub>}}) follow the law of precisely the form expected: {{math|1=''&psi;''<sub>total</sub> = ''&psi;''<sub>first</sub> + ''&psi;''<sub>second</sub>}}. This is the principle of [[quantum superposition]]. The probability, which is the [[Absolute value|modulus]] [[square (algebra)|squared]] of the probability amplitude, then, follows the interference pattern under the requirement that amplitudes are complex:\n:<math>P = |\\psi_{\\rm{first}} + \\psi_{\\rm{second}}|^2 = |\\psi_{\\rm{first}}|^2 + |\\psi_{\\rm{second}}|^2 + 2 |\\psi_{\\rm{first}}| |\\psi_{\\rm{second}}|  \\cos (\\varphi_1-\\varphi_2).</math>\nHere, <math>\\varphi_1</math> and<math>\\varphi_2</math>\nare the [[Argument (complex analysis)|arguments]] of {{math|''&psi;''<sub>first</sub>}} and {{math|''&psi;''<sub>second</sub>}} respectively. A purely real formulation has too few dimensions to describe the system's state when superposition is taken into account. That is, without the arguments of the amplitudes, we cannot describe the phase-dependent interference. The crucial term <math> 2 |\\psi_{\\rm{first}}| |\\psi_{\\rm{second}}|  \\cos (\\varphi_1-\\varphi_2)</math> is called the \"interference term\", and this would be missing if we had added the probabilities.\n\nHowever, one may choose to devise an experiment in which the experimenter observes which slit each electron goes through. Then case B of the above article applies, and the interference pattern is not observed on the screen.\n\nOne may go further in devising an experiment in which the experimenter gets rid of this \"which-path information\" by a [[Quantum eraser experiment|\"quantum eraser\"]]. Then, according to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], the case A applies again and the interference pattern is restored.<ref>A recent 2013 experiment gives insight regarding the correct physical interpretation of such phenomena. The information can actually be obtained, but then the electron seemingly went through all the possible paths simultaneously. (Certain [[Ensemble interpretation|ensemble-alike]] realistic interpretations of the wavefunction may presume such coexistence in all the points of an orbital.)

In other words, amplitudes of a non-[[quantum entanglement|entangled]] composite state are [[multiplication|products]] of original amplitudes, and [[#convenient|respective observables]] on the systems 1 and 2 behave on these states as [[independent random variables]]. This strengthens the probabilistic interpretation explicated [[#The laws of calculating probabilities of events|above]].\n\n==Amplitudes in operators==\nThe concept of amplitudes described above is relevant to quantum state vectors. It is also used in the context of [[unitary operator]]s that are important in the [[scattering theory]], notably in the form of [[S-matrix|S-matrices]]. Whereas moduli of vector components squared, for a given vector, give a fixed probability distribution, moduli of [[matrix element (physics)|matrix element]]s squared are interpreted as [[transition probabilities]] just as in a random process. Like a finite-dimensional [[unit vector]] specifies a finite probability distribution, a finite-dimensional [[unitary matrix]] specifies transition probabilities between a finite number of states. Note that columns of a unitary matrix, as vectors, have the norm 1.\n\nThe \"transitional\" interpretation may be applied to {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}s on non-discrete spaces as well.\n{{Expand section|date=January 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Free particle]]\n*[[Finite potential barrier]]\n*[[Matter wave]]\n*[[Uncertainty principle]]\n*[[John Clive Ward|Ward's probability amplitude]]\n*[[Wave packet]]\n*[[Phase space formulation]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=R.

Interpretation of values of a wave function as the probability amplitude is a pillar of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. In fact, the properties of the space of wave functions were being used to make physical predictions (such as [[atomic emission spectroscopy|emissions from atoms]] being at certain discrete energies) before any physical interpretation of a particular function was offered. Born was awarded half of the 1954 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this understanding (see [[#References|References]]), and the probability thus calculated is sometimes called the \"Born probability\". These probabilistic concepts, namely the probability density and [[quantum measurement]]s, were vigorously contested at the time by the original physicists working on the theory, such as [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]. It is the source of the mysterious consequences and philosophical difficulties in the [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]\u2014topics that continue to be debated even today.\n\n==Overview==\n{{main|Born rule}}\n\n===Physical===\nNeglecting some technical complexities, the problem of [[quantum measurement]] is the behaviour of a quantum state, for which the value of the [[observable]] {{mvar|Q}} to be measured is [[uncertainty principle|uncertain]]. Such a state is thought to be a [[quantum superposition|coherent superposition]] of the observable's ''[[eigenstate]]s'', states on which the value of the observable is uniquely defined, for different possible values of the observable.\n\nWhen a measurement of {{mvar|Q}} is made, the system (under the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]) [[state vector reduction|''jumps'' to one of the eigenstates]], returning the eigenvalue belonging to that eigenstate. The system may always be described by a [[linear combination]] or [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of these eigenstates with unequal [[weight function|\"weights\"]]. Intuitively it is clear that eigenstates with heavier \"weights\" are more \"likely\" to be produced. Indeed, which of the above eigenstates the system jumps to is given by a probabilistic law: the probability of the system jumping to the state is proportional to the absolute value of the corresponding numerical weight squared. These numerical weights are called probability amplitudes, and this relationship used to calculate probabilities from given pure quantum states (such as wave functions) is called the [[Born rule]]. \n\nClearly, the sum of the probabilities, which equals the sum of the absolute squares of the probability amplitudes, must equal 1. This is the [[#Normalization|normalization (see below)]] requirement.\n\nIf the system is known to be in some eigenstate of {{mvar|Q}} (e.g. after an observation of the corresponding eigenvalue of {{mvar|Q}}) the probability of observing that eigenvalue becomes equal to 1 (certain) for all subsequent measurements of {{mvar|Q}} (so long as no other important forces act between the measurements). In other words the probability amplitudes are zero for all the other eigenstates, and remain zero for the future measurements. If the set of eigenstates to which the system can jump upon measurement of {{mvar|Q}} is the same as the set of eigenstates for measurement of {{mvar|R}}, then subsequent measurements of either {{mvar|Q}} or {{mvar|R}} always produce the same values with probability of 1, no matter the order in which they are applied. The probability amplitudes are unaffected by either measurement, and the observables are said to [[commutator|commute]].\n\nBy contrast, if the eigenstates of {{mvar|Q}} and {{mvar|R}} are the different, then measurement of {{mvar|R}} produces a jump to a state that is not an eigenstate of {{mvar|Q}}. Therefore, if the system is known to be in some an eigenstate of {{mvar|Q}} (all probability amplitudes zero except for one eigenstate), then when {{mvar|R}} is observed the probability amplitudes are changed. A second, subsequent observation of {{mvar|Q}} no longer certainly produces the eigenvalue corresponding to the starting state. In other words, the probability amplitudes for the second measurement of {{mvar|Q}} depend on whether it comes before or after a measurement of {{mvar|R}}, and the two observables [[commutator|do not commute]].\n\n===Mathematical===\n<!-- Note: \u03a8\u03c8 are encoded in named entities because they are nearly homoglyphic (although with different vertical position) in some fonts, so one can easily made a mistake during editing. -->\nIn a formal setup, any [[quantum system|system in quantum mechanics]] is described by a state, which is a [[vector space|vector]] {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}}, residing in an abstract [[complex number|complex]] vector space, called a [[Hilbert space]]. It may be either infinite- or finite-[[dimension (vector space)|dimensional]]. A usual presentation of that Hilbert space is a special [[function space]], called [[L2 space|{{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}}]], on certain set {{mvar|X}}, that is either some [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] or a discrete set.\n\nFor a [[measurable function]] <math>\\psi</math>, the condition <math>\\psi \\in L^2(X)</math> specifies that a finitely bounded integral must apply:\n: <math>\\int\\limits_X |\\psi(x)|^2\\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu(x) < \\infty ;</math>\nthis [[integral]] defines the square of the [[normed vector space|norm]] of {{mvar|&psi;}}. If that norm is equal to {{num|1}}, then\n: <math>\\int\\limits_X |\\psi(x)|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(x) = 1.</math>\nIt actually means that any element of {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}} of the norm 1 defines a [[probability measure]] on {{mvar|X}} and a non-negative [[real number|real]] expression {{math|{{abs|''&psi;''(''x'')}}<sup>2</sup>}} defines its [[Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative]] with respect to the standard measure {{mvar|\u03bc}}.\n\n{{anchor|atomic}}If the standard measure {{mvar|\u03bc}} on {{mvar|X}} is [[non-atomic measure|non-atomic]], such as the [[Lebesgue measure]] on the [[real line]], or on [[three-dimensional space]], or similar measures on [[manifold]]s, then a [[real-valued function]] {{math|{{abs|''&psi;''(''x'')}}<sup>2</sup>}} is called a ''probability density''; see details [[#Wave functions and probabilities|below]]. If the standard measure on {{mvar|X}} consists of [[atom (measure theory)|atoms]] only (we shall call such sets {{mvar|X}} ''discrete''), and specifies the measure of any {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}} equal to {{num|1}},<ref>The case of an atomic measure on {{mvar|X}} with {{math|''\u03bc''({''x''}) \u2260 1}} is not interesting, because such {{mvar|x}} that {{math|1=''\u03bc''({''x''}) = 0}} are unused by {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}} and can be dropped, whereas for {{mvar|x}} of positive measures the value of {{math|''\u03bc''({''x''})}} is virtually the question of rescaling of {{math|''&psi;''(''x'')}}. Due to this trivial fix this case was hardly ever considered by physicists.</ref> then an integral over {{mvar|X}} is simply a [[summation|sum]]<ref>If {{mvar|X}} is [[countable set|countable]], then an integral is the sum of an [[infinite series]].</ref> and {{math|{{abs|''&psi;''(''x'')}}<sup>2</sup>}} defines the value of the probability measure on the set {{math|{''x''}}}, in other words, the [[probability]] that the quantum system is in the state {{mvar|x}}. How amplitudes and the vector are related can be understood with the [[standard basis]] of {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}}, elements of which will be denoted by {{math|{{ket|''x''}}}} or {{math|{{bra|''x''}}}} (see [[bra\u2013ket notation]] for the angle bracket notation). In this basis\n:<math> \\psi (x) = \\langle x|\\Psi \\rangle</math>\nspecifies the coordinate presentation of an abstract vector {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}}.\n\nMathematically, many {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} presentations of the system's Hilbert space can exist. We shall consider not an arbitrary one, but a {{visible anchor|convenient}} one for the observable {{mvar|Q}} in question. A convenient configuration space {{mvar|X}} is such that each point {{mvar|x}} produces some unique value of {{mvar|Q}}. For discrete {{mvar|X}} it means that all elements of the standard basis are [[eigenvector]]s of {{mvar|Q}}. In other words, {{mvar|Q}} shall be [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] in that basis. Then <math> \\psi (x)</math> is the \"probability amplitude\" for the eigenstate {{math|{{bra|''x''}}}}. If it corresponds to a non-[[degenerate energy levels|degenerate]] eigenvalue of {{mvar|Q}}, then <math> |\\psi (x)|^2</math> gives the probability of the corresponding value of {{mvar|Q}} for the initial state {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}}.\n\nFor non-discrete {{mvar|X}} there may not be such states as {{math|{{bra|''x''}}}} in {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}}, but the decomposition is in some sense possible; see [[spectral theory]] and [[self-adjoint operator#Spectral theorem|Spectral theorem]] for accurate explanation.\n\n==Wave functions and probabilities==<!-- caution: an internal #-link -->\nIf the configuration space {{mvar|X}} is continuous (something like the [[real line]] or Euclidean space, see [[#atomic|above]]), then there are no valid quantum states corresponding to particular {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}, and the probability that the system is \"in the state {{mvar|x}}\" will always [[almost never|be zero]]. An archetypical example of this is the {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>('''R''')}} space constructed with 1-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]]; it is used to study a motion in [[one-dimensional space|one dimension]]. This presentation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space corresponds to the spectral decomposition of the [[position operator|coordinate operator]]: {{math|1={{langle}}''x''\u2009[[operator (physics)|{{pipe}}\u2009''Q''\u2009{{pipe}}]]\u2009&Psi;{{rangle}} = ''x''&sdot;{{bra-ket|''x''\u2009|\u2009&Psi;}}, ''x'' \u2208 '''R'''}} in this example. Although there are no such vectors as {{math|{{bra|''x''\u2009}}}}, strictly speaking, the expression {{math|{{bra-ket|''x''\u2009|\u2009&Psi;}}}} can be made meaningful, for instance, with spectral theory.\n\nGenerally, it is the case when the [[motion (physics)|motion]] of a particle is described [[position and momentum space|in the position space]], where the corresponding probability amplitude function {{mvar|&psi;}} is the [[wave function]].\n\nIf the function {{math|''&psi;'' \u2208 ''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X''), \u2016''&psi;''\u2016 {{=}} 1}} represents the [[quantum state]] vector {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}}, then the real expression {{math|{{abs|''&psi;''(''x'')}}<sup>2</sup>}}, that depends on {{mvar|x}}, forms a [[probability density function]] of the given state. The difference of a ''density function'' from simply a numerical probability means that one should integrate this modulus-squared function over some (small) domains in {{mvar|X}} to obtain probability values \u2013 as was stated above, the system can't be in some state {{mvar|x}} with a positive probability. It gives to both amplitude and density function a [[dimension of a physical quantity|physical dimension]], unlike a dimensionless probability. For example, for a [[three-dimensional space|3-dimensional]] wave function, the amplitude has the dimension [L<sup>\u22123/2</sup>], where L is length.\n\nNote that for both continuous and infinite discrete cases not ''every'' measurable, or even [[smooth function]] (i.e. a possible wave function) defines an element of {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}}; see [[Normalisation]] below.\n\n==Discrete amplitudes==\nWhen the set {{mvar|X}} is discrete (see [[#atomic|above]]), vectors {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}} represented with the Hilbert space {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}} are just [[column vector]]s composed of \"amplitudes\" and [[indexed family|indexed]] by {{mvar|X}}.\n<!-- \nShould {{mvar|X}} in this case be called a \u201cconfiguration space\u201d?\n --Incnis Mrsi -->\nThese are sometimes referred to as wave functions of a discrete variable {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}. Discrete dynamical variables are used in such problems as a [[Particle in a box|particle in an idealized reflective box]] and [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]. Components of the vector will be denoted by {{math|''&psi;''(''x'')}} for uniformity with the previous case; there may be either finite of infinite number of components depending on the Hilbert space.\nIn this case, if the vector {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}} has the norm 1, then {{math|{{abs|''&psi;''(''x'')}}<sup>2</sup>}} is just the probability that the quantum system resides in the state {{mvar|x}}. It defines a [[discrete probability distribution]] on {{mvar|X}}.\n\n{{math|1={{abs|''&psi;''(''x'')}} = 1}} if and only if {{math|{{ket|''x''}}}} is [[ray (quantum theory)|the same quantum state]] as {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}}. {{math|1=''&psi;''(''x'') = 0}} if and only if {{math|{{ket|''x''}}}} and {{math|{{ket|&Psi;}}}} are orthogonal (see [[inner product space]]). Otherwise the modulus of {{math|''&psi;''(''x'')}} is between 0 and 1.\n\nA discrete probability amplitude may be considered as a [[fundamental frequency]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} in the Probability Frequency domain ([[spherical harmonics]]) for the purposes of simplifying [[M-theory]] transformation calculations.\n\n==A basic example==\n\nTake the simplest meaningful example of the discrete case: a quantum system that can be in [[two-state quantum system|two possible states]]: for example, the [[light polarization|polarization]] of a [[photon]]. When the polarization is measured, it could be the horizontal state {{math|{{ket|\u2009''H''\u2009}}}}, or the vertical state {{math|{{ket|\u2009''V''\u2009}}}}. Until its polarization is measured the photon can be in a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of both these states, so its state {{math|[[ket vector|{{ket|''&psi;''}}]]}} could be written as:\n\n:<math>| \\psi \\rangle = \\alpha |H \\rangle + \\beta |V\\rangle,\\,</math>\n\nThe probability amplitudes of {{math|{{ket|''&psi;''}}}} for the states {{math|{{ket|\u2009''H''\u2009}}}} and {{math|{{ket|\u2009''V''\u2009}}}} are {{mvar|\u03b1}} and {{mvar|\u03b2}} respectively. When the photon's polarization is measured, the resulting state is either horizontal or vertical. But in a random experiment, the probability of being horizontally polarized is {{math|''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>}}, and the probability of being vertically polarized is {{math|''\u03b2''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\nTherefore, a photon in a state <math>| \\psi \\rangle = \\sqrt{1\\over 3} |H\\rangle - i \\sqrt{2\\over 3}|V \\rangle</math> would have a probability of 1/3 to come out horizontally polarized, and a probability of 2/3 to come out vertically polarized when an [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] of measurements are made. The order of such results, is, however, completely random.\n\n==Normalization==<!-- caution: an internal #-link -->\n{{Expand section|explain the link between normalization and the [[conditional probability]]|small=no|date=January 2014}}\nIn the example above, the measurement must give either {{math|{{ket|\u2009''H''\u2009}}}} or {{math|{{ket|\u2009''V''\u2009}}}}, so the total probability of measuring {{math|{{ket|\u2009''H''\u2009}}}} or {{math|{{ket|\u2009''V''\u2009}}}} must be 1. This leads to a constraint that {{math|1=''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03b2''<sup>2</sup> = 1}}; more generally '''the sum of the squared moduli of the probability amplitudes of all the possible states is equal to one'''. If to understand \"all the possible states\" as an [[orthonormal basis]], that makes sense in the discrete case, then this condition is the same as the norm-1 condition explained [[#Mathematical|above]].\n\nOne can always divide any non-zero element of a Hilbert space by its norm and obtain a ''normalized'' state vector. Not every wave function belongs to the Hilbert space {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>(''X'')}}, though. Wave functions that fulfill this constraint are called [[normalizable wave function|normalizable]].\n\nThe [[Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation]], describing states of quantum particles, has solutions that describe a system and determine precisely how the state [[time evolution operator|changes with time]]. Suppose a [[wavefunction]] {{math|''&psi;''<sub>0</sub>('''x''',\u2009''t'')}} is a solution of the wave equation, giving a description of the particle (position {{math|'''x'''}}, for time {{math|''t''}}).  If the wavefunction is [[square integrable]], ''i.e.''\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf R^n} |\\psi_0(\\mathbf x, t_0)|^2\\, \\mathrm{d\\mathbf x} = a^2 < \\infty</math>\nfor some {{math|''t''<sub>0</sub>}}, then {{math|''&psi;'' {{=}} ''&psi;''<sub>0</sub>/''a''}} is called the [[normalized wavefunction]].  Under the standard [[Copenhagen interpretation]], the normalized wavefunction gives probability amplitudes for the position of the particle. Hence, at a given time {{math|''t''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''\u03c1''('''x''') {{=}} {{abs|''&psi;''('''x''',\u2009''t''<sub>0</sub>)}}<sup>2</sup>}} is the [[probability density function]] of the particle's position.  Thus the probability that the particle is in the volume {{math|''V''}} at {{math|''t''<sub>0</sub>}} is\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}(V)=\\int_V \\rho(\\mathbf {x})\\, \\mathrm{d\\mathbf {x}} = \\int_V |\\psi(\\mathbf {x}, t_0)|^2\\, \\mathrm{d\\mathbf {x}}.</math>\nNote that if any solution {{math|''&psi;''<sub>0</sub>}} to the wave equation is normalisable at some time {{math|''t''<sub>0</sub>}}, then the {{mvar|\u03c8}} defined above is always normalised, so that\n:<math>\\rho_t(\\mathbf x)=\\left |\\psi(\\mathbf x, t)\\right |^2 = \\left|\\frac{\\psi_0(\\mathbf x, t)}{a}\\right|^2</math>\nis always a probability density function for all {{math|''t''}}. This is key to understanding the importance of this interpretation, because for a given the particle's constant [[mass]], initial {{math|''&psi;''('''x''',\u20090)}} and the [[potential energy|potential]], the [[Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation|Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] fully determines subsequent wavefunction, and the above then gives probabilities of locations of the particle at all subsequent times.\n\n==The laws of calculating probabilities of events==\n'''A'''. Provided a system evolves naturally (which under the Copenhagen interpretation means that the system is not subjected to measurement), the following laws apply:\n\n#The probability (or the density of probability in position/momentum space) of an event to occur is the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitude for the event: <math>P=|\\phi|^2</math>.\n#If there are several [[mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]], indistinguishable alternatives in which an event might occur (or, in realistic interpretations of wavefunction, several wavefunctions exist for a space-time event), the probability amplitudes of all these possibilities add to give the probability amplitude for that event: <math>\\phi=\\sum_i\\phi_i; P=|\\phi|^2=\\left|\\sum_i\\phi_i\\right|^2</math>.\n#If, for any alternative, there is a succession of sub-events, then the probability amplitude for that alternative is the product of the probability amplitude for each sub-event: <math>\\phi_{APB}=\\phi_{AP}\\phi_{PB}</math>.\n#Non-entangled states of a composite quantum system have amplitudes equal to the product of the amplitudes of the states of constituent systems: <math>\\phi_{\\rm{system}} (\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma,\\delta,\\ldots)=\\phi_1(\\alpha)\\phi_2(\\beta)\\phi_3(\\gamma)\\phi_4(\\delta)\\ldots</math>. See the [[#Composite systems]] section for more information.\nLaw 2 is analogous to the [[probability axioms|addition law of probability]], only the probability being substituted by the probability amplitude. Similarly, Law 4 is analogous to the multiplication law of probability for independent events; note that it fails for [[quantum entanglement|entangled states]].\n\n'''B'''. When an experiment is performed to decide between the several alternatives, the same laws hold true for the corresponding probabilities: <math>P=\\sum_i|\\phi_i|^2</math>.\n\nProvided one knows the probability amplitudes for events associated with an experiment, the above laws provide a complete description of quantum systems in terms of probabilities.\n\nThe above laws give way to the [[path integral formulation|path integral formulation of quantum mechanics]], in the formalism developed by the celebrated theoretical physicist [[Richard Feynman]]. This approach to quantum mechanics forms the stepping-stone to the path integral approach to [[quantum field theory]].\n\n==In the context of the double-slit experiment==\n{{main|Double-slit experiment}}\nProbability amplitudes have special significance because they act in quantum mechanics as the equivalent of conventional probabilities, with many analogous laws, as described above. For example, in the classic [[double-slit experiment]], electrons are fired randomly at two slits, and the probability distribution of detecting electrons at all parts on a large screen placed behind the slits, is questioned. An intuitive answer is that {{math|'''P'''(through either slit) {{=}} '''P'''(through first slit) + '''P'''(through second slit)}}, where {{math|'''P'''(event)}} is the probability of that event. This is obvious if one assumes that an electron passes through either slit. When nature does not have a way to distinguish which slit the electron has gone through (a much more stringent condition than simply \"it is not observed\"), the observed probability distribution on the screen reflects the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]] that is common with light waves. If one assumes the above law to be true, then this pattern cannot be explained. The particles cannot be said to go through either slit and the simple explanation does not work. The correct explanation is, however, by the association of probability amplitudes to each event. This is an example of the case A as described in the previous article. The complex amplitudes which represent the electron passing each slit ({{math|''&psi;''<sub>first</sub>}} and {{math|''&psi;''<sub>second</sub>}}) follow the law of precisely the form expected: {{math|1=''&psi;''<sub>total</sub> = ''&psi;''<sub>first</sub> + ''&psi;''<sub>second</sub>}}. This is the principle of [[quantum superposition]]. The probability, which is the [[Absolute value|modulus]] [[square (algebra)|squared]] of the probability amplitude, then, follows the interference pattern under the requirement that amplitudes are complex:\n:<math>P = |\\psi_{\\rm{first}} + \\psi_{\\rm{second}}|^2 = |\\psi_{\\rm{first}}|^2 + |\\psi_{\\rm{second}}|^2 + 2 |\\psi_{\\rm{first}}| |\\psi_{\\rm{second}}|  \\cos (\\varphi_1-\\varphi_2).</math>\nHere, <math>\\varphi_1</math> and<math>\\varphi_2</math>\nare the [[Argument (complex analysis)|arguments]] of {{math|''&psi;''<sub>first</sub>}} and {{math|''&psi;''<sub>second</sub>}} respectively. A purely real formulation has too few dimensions to describe the system's state when superposition is taken into account. That is, without the arguments of the amplitudes, we cannot describe the phase-dependent interference. The crucial term <math> 2 |\\psi_{\\rm{first}}| |\\psi_{\\rm{second}}|  \\cos (\\varphi_1-\\varphi_2)</math> is called the \"interference term\", and this would be missing if we had added the probabilities.\n\nHowever, one may choose to devise an experiment in which the experimenter observes which slit each electron goes through. Then case B of the above article applies, and the interference pattern is not observed on the screen.\n\nOne may go further in devising an experiment in which the experimenter gets rid of this \"which-path information\" by a [[Quantum eraser experiment|\"quantum eraser\"]]. Then, according to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], the case A applies again and the interference pattern is restored.<ref>A recent 2013 experiment gives insight regarding the correct physical interpretation of such phenomena. The information can actually be obtained, but then the electron seemingly went through all the possible paths simultaneously. (Certain [[Ensemble interpretation|ensemble-alike]] realistic interpretations of the wavefunction may presume such coexistence in all the points of an orbital.)

The corresponding continuity equation describes the local [[Charge conservation|conservation of charges]].{{clarify|reason=Which charges?

In other words, amplitudes of a non-[[quantum entanglement|entangled]] composite state are [[multiplication|products]] of original amplitudes, and [[#convenient|respective observables]] on the systems 1 and 2 behave on these states as [[independent random variables]]. This strengthens the probabilistic interpretation explicated [[#The laws of calculating probabilities of events|above]].\n\n==Amplitudes in operators==\nThe concept of amplitudes described above is relevant to quantum state vectors. It is also used in the context of [[unitary operator]]s that are important in the [[scattering theory]], notably in the form of [[S-matrix|S-matrices]]. Whereas moduli of vector components squared, for a given vector, give a fixed probability distribution, moduli of [[matrix element (physics)|matrix element]]s squared are interpreted as [[transition probabilities]] just as in a random process. Like a finite-dimensional [[unit vector]] specifies a finite probability distribution, a finite-dimensional [[unitary matrix]] specifies transition probabilities between a finite number of states. Note that columns of a unitary matrix, as vectors, have the norm 1.\n\nThe \"transitional\" interpretation may be applied to {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}}s on non-discrete spaces as well.\n{{Expand section|date=January 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Free particle]]\n*[[Finite potential barrier]]\n*[[Matter wave]]\n*[[Uncertainty principle]]\n*[[John Clive Ward|Ward's probability amplitude]]\n*[[Wave packet]]\n*[[Phase space formulation]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=R.
