However, the region of [[Hyrcania]] had been conquered by [[Mithridates I of Parthia]] in 141\u2013139 BCE\n* Given the name by the [[Seleucids]] after he fought in the region alongside [[Antiochus VII Sidetes]] against [[Phraates II of Parthia]] in 130\u2013129 BCE, a campaign which resulted in the release of Antiochus' brother [[Demetrius II Nicator]] from captivity in [[Hyrcania]]\n\n==Life and work==\nHe was the son of [[Simon Thassi]] and hence the nephew of [[Judas Maccabaeus]], [[Jonathan Apphus]] and their siblings, whose story is told in the [[deuterocanonical books]] of [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]], in the [[Talmud]], and in [[Josephus]]. John was not present at a banquet at which his father and his two brothers were murdered, by John's brother-in-law, [[Ptolemy son of Abubus|Ptolemy, son of Abubus]]. He attained to his father's former offices, that of [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] and ethnarch (national leader) - but not king.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities'' XIII 11:1 and ''Jewish Wars'' I 3:1.</ref> Josephus said that John Hyrcanus had five sons but named only four in his histories: [[Aristobulus I|Judah Aristobulus I]], Antigonus I, [[Alexander Jannai]], and Absalom.  It is this fifth brother who is said to have unsuccessfully sought the throne at the death of Aristobulus I.<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' 13.12.1</ref>\n\n==Siege of Jerusalem==\nDuring the first year of John Hyrcanus\u2019s reign, he faced a serious challenge to independent Judean rule from the [[Seleucid Empire]]. [[Antiochus VII Sidetes]] marched into Judea, pillaged the countryside and laid a year-long siege on Jerusalem. The prolonged siege caused Hyrcanus to remove any Judean from the city who could not assist with the defence effort ([[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]] 13.240).  These refugees were not allowed to pass through Antiochus\u2019 lines, becoming trapped in the middle of a chaotic siege. With a humanitarian crisis on his hands, Hyrcanus re-admitted his estranged Jerusalemites when the festival of [[Sukkot]] arrived.  Afterwards, due to food shortages in Jerusalem, Hyrcanus negotiated a truce with Antiochus.<ref>H. Jagersma. A History of Israel from Alexander the Great to Bar Kochba. (Minneapolis.: Fortress Press, 1986), 83.</ref>\n\nThe terms of the truce consisted of three thousand talents of silver as payment for Antiochus, breaking down the walls of Jerusalem, Judean participation in the Seleucid war against the Parthians, and once again Judean recognition of Seleucid control ([[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]] 13.245). These terms were a harsh blow to Hyrcanus, who had to loot the tomb of David to pay the 3000 talents ([[s:The War of the Jews/Book I#Chapter 2|The Wars of the Jews]] I 2:5).\n\nFollowing the Seleucid siege, Judea faced tough economic times which were magnified by taxes to the Seleucids enforced by Antiochus. Furthermore, Hyrcanus was forced to accompany Antiochus on his eastern campaign in 130 BCE. Hyrcanus probably functioned as the military commander of a Jewish company in the campaign.<ref>Joseph Sievers, and Jacob Neusner, ed. The Hasmoneans and Their Supporters: From Matthias to the Death of John Hyrcanus I. (Atlanta.: Scholars Press, 1990), 140.</ref> It is reported that Antiochus, out of consideration for the religion of his Jewish allies, at one point ordered a two days' halt of the entire army to allow them to avoid breaking the Sabbath and Festival of Weeks.<ref>Heinrich Graetz, ''History of the Jews'', vol. II, (Jewish Publication Society, 1893), ch. I, p. 5</ref> \n\nThis enforced absence probably caused a loss of support for the inexperienced Hyrcanus among the Judean population.<ref>Sievers, 139</ref> Judeans in the countryside were especially disillusioned with Hyrcanus after Antiochus\u2019 army plundered their land. Furthermore, John Hyrcanus's driving out the non-military population of Jerusalem during the siege also probably caused resentment against him. The action of looting the Tomb of David violated his obligations as [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]], which would have offended the religious leadership.<ref>Jagersma, 89</ref>\n\nTherefore, at a very early point in his thirty-one year reign of Judea, Hyrcanus had lost the support of Judeans in various cultural sectors. The Jerusalemites, the countryside Judeans and the religious leadership probably doubted the future of Judea under Hyrcanus. However, in 128 BCE  Antiochus VII was killed in battle against [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]]. What followed was an era of conquest led by Hyrcanus that marked the high point of Judea as the most significant power in the [[Levant]].<ref>Elias Bickerman. The Maccabees. (New York: Schocken Books, 1947), 150</ref>\n\n==Conquests by John Hyrcanus==\n[[Image:Judea Johannes Hyrcanus.PNG|right|thumb|Hasmonean Kingdom under John Hyrcanus<br>{{legend|lime|situation in 134 BCE}}{{legend|fuchsia|area conquered}}]]\nJohn Hyrcanus was able to take advantage of unrest in the [[Seleucid Empire]] to assert Judean independence and conquer new territories. In 130 BCE [[Demetrius II Nicator|Demetrius II]], the former Seleucid king, returned from exile in [[Hyrcania]] to take back control of his empire. However, transition of power made it difficult for Demetrius to assert control over Judea.<ref name=\"Sievers, 141\">Sievers, 141</ref>  Furthermore, the Seleucid Empire itself fell apart into smaller principalities. The [[Ituraean]]s of Lebanon, the [[Ammon]]ites of the Transjordan, and the Arabian [[Nabatean]]s represented independent principalities that broke away from Seleucid control.<ref>Gaalyahu Cornfled. Daniel to Paul: Jews In Conflict with Graeco-Roman Civilization. (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1962), 50</ref>  Hyrcanus was determined to take advantage of the dissipating Seleucid Empire to increase the Judean State.\n\nHyrcanus also raised a new mercenary army that strongly contrasted with the Judean forces that were defeated by Antiochus VII (Ant.13.249). The Judean population was probably still recovering from the attack of Antiochus, and therefore could not provide enough able men for a Hyrcanus-led army.<ref name=\"Sievers, 141\"/> John Hyrcanus's army was supported by the Judean State once again by funds that Hyrcanus removed from the Tomb of David.<ref>Bickerman, 149\u2013150</ref>\n\nBeginning in 113 BCE, Hyrcanus began an extensive military campaign against [[Samaria]]. Hyrcanus placed his sons Antigonus and Aristobulus in charge of the siege of Samaria. The [[Samaritans]] called for help and eventually received 6000 troops from [[Antiochus IX Cyzicenus]]. Although the siege lasted for a long, difficult year, Hyrcanus was unwilling to give up. Ultimately, Samaria was overrun and totally destroyed. Cyzicenus' mercenary army was defeated and the city of [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]] seems to have been occupied by Hyrcanus as well.<ref>Jagersma, 83</ref>  The inhabitants of Samaria were then put into [[slavery]]. Upon conquering the former Seleucid regions Hyrcanus embarked on a policy of forcing the non-Jewish populations to adopt Jewish customs.<ref name=\"Berlin 2011\">{{cite book |title= The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion |last= Berlin |first= Adele |year= 2011 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199730049 |quote= John Hyrcanus I, who embarked upon further territorial conquests, forcing the non-Jewish populations of the conquered regions to adopt the Jewish way of life and destroying the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim.|page=330 }}.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Jonathan Bourgel |title=The Destruction of the Samaritan Temple by John Hyrcanus: A Reconsideration |year=2016 |publisher=[[Society of Biblical Literature]] |journal=[[Journal of Biblical Literature]] |url=https://www.academia.edu/34049422/The_Destruction_of_the_Samaritan_Temple_by_John_Hyrcanus_A_Reconsideration |doi=10.15699/jbl.1353.2016.3129 |issue=153/3}}</ref>\n\nJohn Hyrcanus's first conquest was an invasion of the Transjordan in 110 BCE.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEj7FA8InCoC&pg=PA287&lpg=PA287&dq=hyrcanus+medeba+110&source=bl&ots=CHjjvpQcZZ&sig=357llCEJ8MiRLcqzffN9MCZYskQ&hl=en&ei=h4GfTZWZOarg0QHWst0q&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=hyrcanus%20medeba%20110&f=false |title=Encyclopaedic dictionary of the Bible, Volume 5, William George Smith |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2010-12-07 |access-date=2011-12-06}}</ref> John Hyrcanus\u2019s mercenary army laid siege to the city of [[Medeba]] and took it after a six-month siege. After these victories, Hyrcanus went north towards [[Shechem]] and [[Mount Gerizim]].

During this campaign Hyrcanus conquered [[Adora (Apocrypha)|Adora]], [[Maresha]] and other Idumean towns (Ant.13.257). Hyrcanus then instituted [[forced conversion]]s on the Idumeans to Judaism.<ref>George W. E. Nickelsburg. Jewish Literature Between The Bible And The Mishnah, with CD-ROM, Second Edition.

Meshorer Group B, 11; Hendin 457.]]\nAfter the siege of Jerusalem, Hyrcanus faced a serious economic crisis in Judea. We can assume that the economic difficulties subsided after the death of [[Antiochus VII]]. Hyrcanus no longer had to pay taxes or tributes to a weaker Seleucia.<ref>Sievers, 157</ref>  The economic situation eventually improved enough for Hyrcanus to issue his own coinage (see below). On top of that, Hyrcanus initiated vital building projects in Judea. Hyrcanus re-built the walls destroyed by Antiochus. He also built a fortress north of the Temple called the Baris and possibly also the fortress [[Hyrcania (fortress)|Hyrcania]].<ref>[[W. D. Davies]]. ''The Cambridge History of Judaism, Vol. 2: The Hellenistic Age''. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 331\u2013332</ref>\n\nMoreover, Hyrcanus sought for good relations with the surrounding Gentile powers, especially the growing [[Roman Republic]]. Two decrees were passed in the [[Roman Senate]] that established a treaty of friendship with Judea.<ref>Jagersma, 84</ref>  Although it is difficult to specifically date these resolutions, they represent efforts made between Hyrcanus and Rome to maintain stable relations. Also, an embassy sent by Hyrcanus received Roman confirmation of Hasmonean independence.<ref>David Noel Freedman. ''The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary, H\u2013J: Volume 3''. (New Haven: Yale University Press), 1992</ref> Hyrcanus was an excellent case of a ruler backed by Roman support.\n\nIn addition to Rome, Hyrcanus was able to maintain steady relations with [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. This was probably made possible due to various Jews living in Egypt who had connections with the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] Court (Ant. 13.284\u2013287). Finally, the cities of [[History of Athens#Athens under Macedon|Athens]] and [[Pergamum|Pergamon]] even showed honor to Hyrcanus in an effort to appease Rome.<ref>Davies, 332</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the minting of coins by Hyrcanus demonstrates John Hyrcanus\u2019s willingness to delegate power. Sixty-three coins found near [[Bethlehem]] bear the inscription, \u201cYohanan the High Priest.\u201d  The reserve side of the coins contains the phrase, \u201cThe Assembly of the Jews.\u201d This seems to suggest that during his reign, Hyrcanus was not an absolute ruler. Instead, Hyrcanus had to submit at times to an assembly of Jews that had a certain amount of minority power.<ref>Cornfeld, 52</ref>  The coins lack any depictions of animals or humans. This suggests that Hyrcanus strictly followed the Jewish prohibition against [[you shall not make for yourself an idol|graven images]]. The coins also seem to suggest that Hyrcanus considered himself to be primarily the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] of Judea, and his rule of Judea was shared with the Assembly.<ref>Sievers, 153\u2013154</ref>\n\nIn Judea, religious issues were a core aspect of domestic policy. Josephus only reports one specific conflict between Hyrcanus and the [[Pharisee]]s, who asked him to relinquish the position of High Priest (Ant. 13.288\u2013296).<ref>Nickelsburg, 93</ref> After this falling-out, Hyrcanus sided with the rivals of the Pharisees, the [[Sadducee]]s. However, elsewhere Josephus reports that the Pharisees did not grow to power until the reign of Queen [[Salome Alexandra]] (JW.1.110) The coins minted under Hyrcanus suggest that Hyrcanus did not have complete secular authority. Furthermore, this account may represent a piece of Pharisaic apologetics due to Josephus\u2019s Pharisaic background.<ref>Sievers, 155</ref> Regardless, there were probably tensions because of the religious and secular leadership roles held by Hyrcanus.\n\nUltimately, one of the final acts of John Hyrcanus\u2019s life was an act that solved any kind of dispute over his role as High Priest and ethnarch. In the will of Hyrcanus, he provisioned for the division of the high priesthood from secular authority. John Hyrcanus\u2019s widow was given control of civil authority after his death, and his son [[Judas Aristobulus]] was given the role of High Priest. This action represented John Hyrcanus\u2019s willingness to compromise over the issue of secular and religious authority.<ref>Gaalyahu, 55</ref> (However, Aristobulus was not satisfied with this arrangement, so he cast his mother into prison and let her starve.)\n\n==Legacy==\nJohn Hyrcanus the High Priest is remembered in rabbinic literature as having made several outstanding enactments and deeds worthy of memorial, one of which being that he cancelled the requirement of saying the avowal mentioned in Deuteronomy 26:12\u201315 once in every three years, since he saw that in Israel they had ceased to separate the [[First tithe|First Tithe]] in its proper manner and which, by making the avowal, and saying \"I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord my God, and have done according to all that you have commanded me,\" he makes himself dishonest before his Maker and liable to God's wrath.<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Sotah'' 5:5</ref> In his days, the First Tithe, which was meant to be given unto the Levites, was given instead to the [[Kohen|priests of Aaron's lineage]], after [[Ezra the scribe|Ezra]] had fined the [[Levites]] for not returning in full force to the Land of Israel. By not being able to give the First Tithe unto the Levites, as originally commanded by God, this made the avowal null and void.<ref>[[Maimonides]]' ''Mishnah Commentary'' (''Ma'aser Sheni'' 5:15), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, p. 233</ref> In addition, John Hyrcanus is remembered for having cancelled the reading of Psalm 44:23, formerly chanted daily by the Levites in the Temple precincts, and which words, \"Awake! Why do you sleep, O Lord?, etc.\",  seemed inappropriate, as if they were imposing their own will over God's, or that God was actually sleeping.<ref>''Jerusalem Talmud'' with a Commentary of [[Solomon Sirilio]], ''Ma'aser Sheni'' 5:5</ref> In similar fashion, the High Priest cancelled an ill-practice had by the people to cause bleeding near the eyes of sacrificial calves by beating their heads so as to stun them, prior to their being bound and slaughtered, since by beating the animal in such a way they ran the risk of causing a blemish in the animal's membrane lining its brain.<ref>[[Maimonides]]' ''Mishnah Commentary'' (''Ma'aser Sheni'' 5:15), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, p. 233; cf. [[Solomon Sirilio|Sirilio]]'s Commentary (ibid.); [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Sotah'' 48a).</ref> To prevent this from happening, the High Priest made rings in the ground of the Temple court for helping to secure the animals before slaughter.\n\nBefore John Hyrcanus officiated as Israel's High Priest, the people had it as a practice to do manual work on the [[intermediate days]] of the Jewish holidays, and one could hear in Jerusalem the hammer pounding against the anvil. The High Priest passed an edict restricting such labours on those days, thinking it inappropriate to do servile work on the ''[[Hol ha-Moed]]'', until after the Feast (''Yom Tov''). It had also been a custom in Israel, since the days that the [[Hasmoneans]] defeated the [[Grecians]] who prevented them from mentioning the name of God in heaven, to inscribe the name of God in their ordinary contracts, [[Bill of sale|bills of sale]] and [[promissory notes]]. They would write, for example, \"In the year such and such of Yohanan, the High Priest of the Most High God.\" But when the Sages of Israel became sensible of the fact that such ordinary contracts were often discarded in the rubbish after reimbursement, it was deemed improper to show disrespect to God's name by doing so. Therefore, on the 3rd day of the lunar month [[Tishri]], the practice of writing God's name in ordinary contracts was cancelled altogether, while the date of such cancellation was declared a day of rejoicing, and inscribed in the [[Megillat Taanit|Scroll of Fasting]].<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Rosh Hashanna'' 18b)</ref>\n\nThe [[Mishnah]] (''Parah'' 3:4[5]) also relates that during the tenure of John Hyrcanus as High Priesthood, he had prepared the ashes of two [[Red heifer]]s used in purifying those who had contracted corpse uncleanness.<ref>[[Maimonides]]' ''Mishnah Commentary'' (''Ma'aser Sheni'' 5:15), vol. 3, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1967, p. 260</ref>\n\nIn what is seen as yet another one of John Hyrcanus's accomplishments, during his days any commoner or [[Am ha'aretz|rustic]] could be trusted in what concerns ''[[Demai]]''-produce (that is, if a doubt arose over whether or not such produce bought from him had been correctly divested of its tithes), since even the common folk in Israel were careful to separate the ''[[Terumah]]''-offering given to the [[Kohen|priests]]. Still, such produce required its buyer to separate the [[First tithe|First]] and [[Second tithe|Second Tithes]].<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Sotah'' 48a)</ref> Some view this as also being a discredit unto the High Priest, seeing that the commoners refused to separate these latter tithes because of being intimidated by bullies, who took these tithes from the public treasuries by force, while John Hyrcanus refused to censure such bad conduct.<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Ma'aser Sheni'' 5:5, Commentary of [[Solomon Sirilio]].</ref>\n\nAfter all said and done, and after accomplishing many heroic feats, John Hyrcanus in the later years of his life, abandoned the sect of the [[Pharisees]], and joined himself to the [[Sadducees]].

However, the region of [[Hyrcania]] had been conquered by [[Mithridates I of Parthia]] in 141\u2013139 BCE\n* Given the name by the [[Seleucids]] after he fought in the region alongside [[Antiochus VII Sidetes]] against [[Phraates II of Parthia]] in 130\u2013129 BCE, a campaign which resulted in the release of Antiochus' brother [[Demetrius II Nicator]] from captivity in [[Hyrcania]]\n\n==Life and work==\nHe was the son of [[Simon Thassi]] and hence the nephew of [[Judas Maccabaeus]], [[Jonathan Apphus]] and their siblings, whose story is told in the [[deuterocanonical books]] of [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]], in the [[Talmud]], and in [[Josephus]]. John was not present at a banquet at which his father and his two brothers were murdered, by John's brother-in-law, [[Ptolemy son of Abubus|Ptolemy, son of Abubus]]. He attained to his father's former offices, that of [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] and ethnarch (national leader) - but not king.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities'' XIII 11:1 and ''Jewish Wars'' I 3:1.</ref> Josephus said that John Hyrcanus had five sons but named only four in his histories: [[Aristobulus I|Judah Aristobulus I]], Antigonus I, [[Alexander Jannai]], and Absalom.  It is this fifth brother who is said to have unsuccessfully sought the throne at the death of Aristobulus I.<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' 13.12.1</ref>\n\n==Siege of Jerusalem==\nDuring the first year of John Hyrcanus\u2019s reign, he faced a serious challenge to independent Judean rule from the [[Seleucid Empire]]. [[Antiochus VII Sidetes]] marched into Judea, pillaged the countryside and laid a year-long siege on Jerusalem. The prolonged siege caused Hyrcanus to remove any Judean from the city who could not assist with the defence effort ([[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]] 13.240).  These refugees were not allowed to pass through Antiochus\u2019 lines, becoming trapped in the middle of a chaotic siege. With a humanitarian crisis on his hands, Hyrcanus re-admitted his estranged Jerusalemites when the festival of [[Sukkot]] arrived.  Afterwards, due to food shortages in Jerusalem, Hyrcanus negotiated a truce with Antiochus.<ref>H. Jagersma. A History of Israel from Alexander the Great to Bar Kochba. (Minneapolis.: Fortress Press, 1986), 83.</ref>\n\nThe terms of the truce consisted of three thousand talents of silver as payment for Antiochus, breaking down the walls of Jerusalem, Judean participation in the Seleucid war against the Parthians, and once again Judean recognition of Seleucid control ([[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]] 13.245). These terms were a harsh blow to Hyrcanus, who had to loot the tomb of David to pay the 3000 talents ([[s:The War of the Jews/Book I#Chapter 2|The Wars of the Jews]] I 2:5).\n\nFollowing the Seleucid siege, Judea faced tough economic times which were magnified by taxes to the Seleucids enforced by Antiochus. Furthermore, Hyrcanus was forced to accompany Antiochus on his eastern campaign in 130 BCE. Hyrcanus probably functioned as the military commander of a Jewish company in the campaign.<ref>Joseph Sievers, and Jacob Neusner, ed. The Hasmoneans and Their Supporters: From Matthias to the Death of John Hyrcanus I. (Atlanta.: Scholars Press, 1990), 140.</ref> It is reported that Antiochus, out of consideration for the religion of his Jewish allies, at one point ordered a two days' halt of the entire army to allow them to avoid breaking the Sabbath and Festival of Weeks.<ref>Heinrich Graetz, ''History of the Jews'', vol. II, (Jewish Publication Society, 1893), ch. I, p. 5</ref> \n\nThis enforced absence probably caused a loss of support for the inexperienced Hyrcanus among the Judean population.<ref>Sievers, 139</ref> Judeans in the countryside were especially disillusioned with Hyrcanus after Antiochus\u2019 army plundered their land. Furthermore, John Hyrcanus's driving out the non-military population of Jerusalem during the siege also probably caused resentment against him. The action of looting the Tomb of David violated his obligations as [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]], which would have offended the religious leadership.<ref>Jagersma, 89</ref>\n\nTherefore, at a very early point in his thirty-one year reign of Judea, Hyrcanus had lost the support of Judeans in various cultural sectors. The Jerusalemites, the countryside Judeans and the religious leadership probably doubted the future of Judea under Hyrcanus. However, in 128 BCE  Antiochus VII was killed in battle against [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]]. What followed was an era of conquest led by Hyrcanus that marked the high point of Judea as the most significant power in the [[Levant]].<ref>Elias Bickerman. The Maccabees. (New York: Schocken Books, 1947), 150</ref>\n\n==Conquests by John Hyrcanus==\n[[Image:Judea Johannes Hyrcanus.PNG|right|thumb|Hasmonean Kingdom under John Hyrcanus<br>{{legend|lime|situation in 134 BCE}}{{legend|fuchsia|area conquered}}]]\nJohn Hyrcanus was able to take advantage of unrest in the [[Seleucid Empire]] to assert Judean independence and conquer new territories. In 130 BCE [[Demetrius II Nicator|Demetrius II]], the former Seleucid king, returned from exile in [[Hyrcania]] to take back control of his empire. However, transition of power made it difficult for Demetrius to assert control over Judea.<ref name=\"Sievers, 141\">Sievers, 141</ref>  Furthermore, the Seleucid Empire itself fell apart into smaller principalities. The [[Ituraean]]s of Lebanon, the [[Ammon]]ites of the Transjordan, and the Arabian [[Nabatean]]s represented independent principalities that broke away from Seleucid control.<ref>Gaalyahu Cornfled. Daniel to Paul: Jews In Conflict with Graeco-Roman Civilization. (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1962), 50</ref>  Hyrcanus was determined to take advantage of the dissipating Seleucid Empire to increase the Judean State.\n\nHyrcanus also raised a new mercenary army that strongly contrasted with the Judean forces that were defeated by Antiochus VII (Ant.13.249). The Judean population was probably still recovering from the attack of Antiochus, and therefore could not provide enough able men for a Hyrcanus-led army.<ref name=\"Sievers, 141\"/> John Hyrcanus's army was supported by the Judean State once again by funds that Hyrcanus removed from the Tomb of David.<ref>Bickerman, 149\u2013150</ref>\n\nBeginning in 113 BCE, Hyrcanus began an extensive military campaign against [[Samaria]]. Hyrcanus placed his sons Antigonus and Aristobulus in charge of the siege of Samaria. The [[Samaritans]] called for help and eventually received 6000 troops from [[Antiochus IX Cyzicenus]]. Although the siege lasted for a long, difficult year, Hyrcanus was unwilling to give up. Ultimately, Samaria was overrun and totally destroyed. Cyzicenus' mercenary army was defeated and the city of [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]] seems to have been occupied by Hyrcanus as well.<ref>Jagersma, 83</ref>  The inhabitants of Samaria were then put into [[slavery]]. Upon conquering the former Seleucid regions Hyrcanus embarked on a policy of forcing the non-Jewish populations to adopt Jewish customs.<ref name=\"Berlin 2011\">{{cite book |title= The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion |last= Berlin |first= Adele |year= 2011 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199730049 |quote= John Hyrcanus I, who embarked upon further territorial conquests, forcing the non-Jewish populations of the conquered regions to adopt the Jewish way of life and destroying the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim.|page=330 }}.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Jonathan Bourgel |title=The Destruction of the Samaritan Temple by John Hyrcanus: A Reconsideration |year=2016 |publisher=[[Society of Biblical Literature]] |journal=[[Journal of Biblical Literature]] |url=https://www.academia.edu/34049422/The_Destruction_of_the_Samaritan_Temple_by_John_Hyrcanus_A_Reconsideration |doi=10.15699/jbl.1353.2016.3129 |issue=153/3}}</ref>\n\nJohn Hyrcanus's first conquest was an invasion of the Transjordan in 110 BCE.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEj7FA8InCoC&pg=PA287&lpg=PA287&dq=hyrcanus+medeba+110&source=bl&ots=CHjjvpQcZZ&sig=357llCEJ8MiRLcqzffN9MCZYskQ&hl=en&ei=h4GfTZWZOarg0QHWst0q&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=hyrcanus%20medeba%20110&f=false |title=Encyclopaedic dictionary of the Bible, Volume 5, William George Smith |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2010-12-07 |access-date=2011-12-06}}</ref> John Hyrcanus\u2019s mercenary army laid siege to the city of [[Medeba]] and took it after a six-month siege.

During this campaign Hyrcanus conquered [[Adora (Apocrypha)|Adora]], [[Maresha]] and other Idumean towns (Ant.13.257). Hyrcanus then instituted [[forced conversion]]s on the Idumeans to Judaism.<ref>George W. E. Nickelsburg. Jewish Literature Between The Bible And The Mishnah, with CD-ROM, Second Edition.

Meshorer Group B, 11; Hendin 457.]]\nAfter the siege of Jerusalem, Hyrcanus faced a serious economic crisis in Judea. We can assume that the economic difficulties subsided after the death of [[Antiochus VII]]. Hyrcanus no longer had to pay taxes or tributes to a weaker Seleucia.<ref>Sievers, 157</ref>  The economic situation eventually improved enough for Hyrcanus to issue his own coinage (see below). On top of that, Hyrcanus initiated vital building projects in Judea. Hyrcanus re-built the walls destroyed by Antiochus. He also built a fortress north of the Temple called the Baris and possibly also the fortress [[Hyrcania (fortress)|Hyrcania]].<ref>[[W. D. Davies]]. ''The Cambridge History of Judaism, Vol. 2: The Hellenistic Age''. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 331\u2013332</ref>\n\nMoreover, Hyrcanus sought for good relations with the surrounding Gentile powers, especially the growing [[Roman Republic]]. Two decrees were passed in the [[Roman Senate]] that established a treaty of friendship with Judea.<ref>Jagersma, 84</ref>  Although it is difficult to specifically date these resolutions, they represent efforts made between Hyrcanus and Rome to maintain stable relations. Also, an embassy sent by Hyrcanus received Roman confirmation of Hasmonean independence.<ref>David Noel Freedman. ''The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary, H\u2013J: Volume 3''. (New Haven: Yale University Press), 1992</ref> Hyrcanus was an excellent case of a ruler backed by Roman support.\n\nIn addition to Rome, Hyrcanus was able to maintain steady relations with [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. This was probably made possible due to various Jews living in Egypt who had connections with the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] Court (Ant. 13.284\u2013287). Finally, the cities of [[History of Athens#Athens under Macedon|Athens]] and [[Pergamum|Pergamon]] even showed honor to Hyrcanus in an effort to appease Rome.<ref>Davies, 332</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the minting of coins by Hyrcanus demonstrates John Hyrcanus\u2019s willingness to delegate power. Sixty-three coins found near [[Bethlehem]] bear the inscription, \u201cYohanan the High Priest.\u201d  The reserve side of the coins contains the phrase, \u201cThe Assembly of the Jews.\u201d This seems to suggest that during his reign, Hyrcanus was not an absolute ruler. Instead, Hyrcanus had to submit at times to an assembly of Jews that had a certain amount of minority power.<ref>Cornfeld, 52</ref>  The coins lack any depictions of animals or humans. This suggests that Hyrcanus strictly followed the Jewish prohibition against [[you shall not make for yourself an idol|graven images]]. The coins also seem to suggest that Hyrcanus considered himself to be primarily the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] of Judea, and his rule of Judea was shared with the Assembly.<ref>Sievers, 153\u2013154</ref>\n\nIn Judea, religious issues were a core aspect of domestic policy. Josephus only reports one specific conflict between Hyrcanus and the [[Pharisee]]s, who asked him to relinquish the position of High Priest (Ant. 13.288\u2013296).<ref>Nickelsburg, 93</ref> After this falling-out, Hyrcanus sided with the rivals of the Pharisees, the [[Sadducee]]s. However, elsewhere Josephus reports that the Pharisees did not grow to power until the reign of Queen [[Salome Alexandra]] (JW.1.110) The coins minted under Hyrcanus suggest that Hyrcanus did not have complete secular authority. Furthermore, this account may represent a piece of Pharisaic apologetics due to Josephus\u2019s Pharisaic background.<ref>Sievers, 155</ref> Regardless, there were probably tensions because of the religious and secular leadership roles held by Hyrcanus.\n\nUltimately, one of the final acts of John Hyrcanus\u2019s life was an act that solved any kind of dispute over his role as High Priest and ethnarch. In the will of Hyrcanus, he provisioned for the division of the high priesthood from secular authority. John Hyrcanus\u2019s widow was given control of civil authority after his death, and his son [[Judas Aristobulus]] was given the role of High Priest. This action represented John Hyrcanus\u2019s willingness to compromise over the issue of secular and religious authority.<ref>Gaalyahu, 55</ref> (However, Aristobulus was not satisfied with this arrangement, so he cast his mother into prison and let her starve.)\n\n==Legacy==\nJohn Hyrcanus the High Priest is remembered in rabbinic literature as having made several outstanding enactments and deeds worthy of memorial, one of which being that he cancelled the requirement of saying the avowal mentioned in Deuteronomy 26:12\u201315 once in every three years, since he saw that in Israel they had ceased to separate the [[First tithe|First Tithe]] in its proper manner and which, by making the avowal, and saying \"I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord my God, and have done according to all that you have commanded me,\" he makes himself dishonest before his Maker and liable to God's wrath.<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Sotah'' 5:5</ref> In his days, the First Tithe, which was meant to be given unto the Levites, was given instead to the [[Kohen|priests of Aaron's lineage]], after [[Ezra the scribe|Ezra]] had fined the [[Levites]] for not returning in full force to the Land of Israel. By not being able to give the First Tithe unto the Levites, as originally commanded by God, this made the avowal null and void.<ref>[[Maimonides]]' ''Mishnah Commentary'' (''Ma'aser Sheni'' 5:15), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, p. 233</ref> In addition, John Hyrcanus is remembered for having cancelled the reading of Psalm 44:23, formerly chanted daily by the Levites in the Temple precincts, and which words, \"Awake! Why do you sleep, O Lord?, etc.\",  seemed inappropriate, as if they were imposing their own will over God's, or that God was actually sleeping.<ref>''Jerusalem Talmud'' with a Commentary of [[Solomon Sirilio]], ''Ma'aser Sheni'' 5:5</ref> In similar fashion, the High Priest cancelled an ill-practice had by the people to cause bleeding near the eyes of sacrificial calves by beating their heads so as to stun them, prior to their being bound and slaughtered, since by beating the animal in such a way they ran the risk of causing a blemish in the animal's membrane lining its brain.<ref>[[Maimonides]]' ''Mishnah Commentary'' (''Ma'aser Sheni'' 5:15), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, p. 233; cf. [[Solomon Sirilio|Sirilio]]'s Commentary (ibid.); [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Sotah'' 48a).</ref> To prevent this from happening, the High Priest made rings in the ground of the Temple court for helping to secure the animals before slaughter.\n\nBefore John Hyrcanus officiated as Israel's High Priest, the people had it as a practice to do manual work on the [[intermediate days]] of the Jewish holidays, and one could hear in Jerusalem the hammer pounding against the anvil. The High Priest passed an edict restricting such labours on those days, thinking it inappropriate to do servile work on the ''[[Hol ha-Moed]]'', until after the Feast (''Yom Tov''). It had also been a custom in Israel, since the days that the [[Hasmoneans]] defeated the [[Grecians]] who prevented them from mentioning the name of God in heaven, to inscribe the name of God in their ordinary contracts, [[Bill of sale|bills of sale]] and [[promissory notes]]. They would write, for example, \"In the year such and such of Yohanan, the High Priest of the Most High God.\" But when the Sages of Israel became sensible of the fact that such ordinary contracts were often discarded in the rubbish after reimbursement, it was deemed improper to show disrespect to God's name by doing so. Therefore, on the 3rd day of the lunar month [[Tishri]], the practice of writing God's name in ordinary contracts was cancelled altogether, while the date of such cancellation was declared a day of rejoicing, and inscribed in the [[Megillat Taanit|Scroll of Fasting]].<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Rosh Hashanna'' 18b)</ref>\n\nThe [[Mishnah]] (''Parah'' 3:4[5]) also relates that during the tenure of John Hyrcanus as High Priesthood, he had prepared the ashes of two [[Red heifer]]s used in purifying those who had contracted corpse uncleanness.<ref>[[Maimonides]]' ''Mishnah Commentary'' (''Ma'aser Sheni'' 5:15), vol. 3, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1967, p. 260</ref>\n\nIn what is seen as yet another one of John Hyrcanus's accomplishments, during his days any commoner or [[Am ha'aretz|rustic]] could be trusted in what concerns ''[[Demai]]''-produce (that is, if a doubt arose over whether or not such produce bought from him had been correctly divested of its tithes), since even the common folk in Israel were careful to separate the ''[[Terumah]]''-offering given to the [[Kohen|priests]].

Although much more powerful than Firestreak, both missiles remained in service until 1988 when the last of the [[English Electric Lightning]]s retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, Magpie II, while Mk.

Lower launch speeds allowed the steel wings and fins to be replaced, and these were enlarged to provide more maneuvering power. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. Other oddities of the Firestreak, like the fin actuators being in the nose and requiring pushrods running the length of the fuselage were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\".

In another controversial gesture he blocked the entrance of the gallery with stripes of his first [[solo exhibition]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Expanding on this idea, in 1971 he created a six-foot banner, ''Peinture-Sculpture'', to divide the [[Solomon R.

In the late 1960s he connected to the ideas of space and presentation arising through [[Deconstructionism|deconstructionist philosophies]] that had as their background the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 student demonstrations in France]]. Between 1966 and 1967, he joined forces with fellow artists [[Olivier Mosset]], Michel Parmentier, and [[Niele Toroni]] to form the [[BMPT (art group)|BMPT]], whose intention was to reduce paintings to the most basic physical and visual elements through the systematic repetition of [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nOften referred to as \"the stripe guy,\" Buren also expresses his theme in paint, [[Laser cutting|laser cut]] fabric, [[light box]]es, transparent fabrics and [[Ceramic art|ceramic cup sets]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} His stripes are displayed in private homes, public places, and museums worldwide. Since the 1950s he has amassed some 400,000 of what he calls ''photos-souvenirs'', documenting his work and travels around the globe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Installations ===\nFrom 1960 on, Buren designed a number of permanent site-specific installations in the United States, Belgium, France, and Germany. In 1986 he created a 3,000-square-meter sculpture in the great [[courtyard]] of the [[Palais Royal]], in Paris: ''[[Les Deux Plateaux]]'', more commonly referred to as the ''Colonnes de Buren'' (\"Buren's Columns\").{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} This provoked an intense debate over the integration of [[contemporary art]] and historic buildings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} In 1993, Buren was [[commission (art)|commission]]ed to design the work in situ, ''Poser/D\u00e9poser/Exposer,'' for the Caf\u00e9 Richelieu at the [[Louvre]] in collaboration with Jean-Pierre Raynaud.\n\nSince the 1990s, Buren's work has become more architectural.

Other artists, including [[Dan Flavin]] and [[Donald Judd]], protested that the banner blocked views across the rotunda, compromising their works.

The work is [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] [[Installation art|installation]], having a relation to its setting in contrast to prevailing ideas of an autonomous work of art.\n\n=== Early work ===\nHe graduated from the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des arts appliqu\u00e9s et des m\u00e9tiers d'art|Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des M\u00e9tiers d'Art]] in Paris, in 1960.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&artistid=833&page=1&sole=y&collab=y&attr=y&sort=default&tabview=bio Daniel Buren] Tate Collection.</ref> He began painting in the early 1960s.

Working on-site, he strives to contextualise his artistic practice using the stripe \u2013 a popular French fabric motif \u2013 as a means of visually relating art to its situation, a form of language in space rather than a space in itself.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Denoting the trademark stripes as a visual instrument or \"seeing tool,\" he invites viewers to take up his critical standpoint challenging traditional ideas about art.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nHe began producing unsolicited public art works using striped awning canvas common in France: he started by setting up hundreds of striped [[posters]], so-called ''affichages sauvages'', around Paris and later in more than 100 Metro stations, drawing public attention through these unauthorised bandit-style acts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} In June 1970 he put stripes on the front and back of Los Angeles bus benches without permission. In another controversial gesture he blocked the entrance of the gallery with stripes of his first [[solo exhibition]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Expanding on this idea, in 1971 he created a six-foot banner, ''Peinture-Sculpture'', to divide the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]'s rotunda in New York.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} For his first New York City solo show in 1973, Buren suspended a set of nineteen black and white striped squares of canvas on a cable that ran from one end of the John Weber Gallery to the other, out the window to a building on the other side of [[West Broadway]] and back.<ref>Linda Yablonsky (20 March 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/20/arts/design/20yabl.html?pagewanted=all&position= The Guggenheim Outcast Who Laughed Last] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> Nine pieces were inside the gallery and nine outside; a middle piece, which connected the outside and the inside parts of the installation, was placed half-in and half-out in the opening where the window frame had been removed for the duration of the exhibition.<ref>[http://2012.monumenta.com/en/within-and-beyond-the-frame ''Within and Beyond the Frame'', 1973] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213030705/http://2012.monumenta.com/en/within-and-beyond-the-frame |date=13 February 2015 }}, ''Monumenta 2012'', Paris.

In the late 1960s he connected to the ideas of space and presentation arising through [[Deconstructionism|deconstructionist philosophies]] that had as their background the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 student demonstrations in France]]. Between 1966 and 1967, he joined forces with fellow artists [[Olivier Mosset]], Michel Parmentier, and [[Niele Toroni]] to form the [[BMPT (art group)|BMPT]], whose intention was to reduce paintings to the most basic physical and visual elements through the systematic repetition of [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nOften referred to as \"the stripe guy,\" Buren also expresses his theme in paint, [[Laser cutting|laser cut]] fabric, [[light box]]es, transparent fabrics and [[Ceramic art|ceramic cup sets]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} His stripes are displayed in private homes, public places, and museums worldwide. Since the 1950s he has amassed some 400,000 of what he calls ''photos-souvenirs'', documenting his work and travels around the globe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Installations ===\nFrom 1960 on, Buren designed a number of permanent site-specific installations in the United States, Belgium, France, and Germany. In 1986 he created a 3,000-square-meter sculpture in the great [[courtyard]] of the [[Palais Royal]], in Paris: ''[[Les Deux Plateaux]]'', more commonly referred to as the ''Colonnes de Buren'' (\"Buren's Columns\").{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} This provoked an intense debate over the integration of [[contemporary art]] and historic buildings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} In 1993, Buren was [[commission (art)|commission]]ed to design the work in situ, ''Poser/D\u00e9poser/Exposer,'' for the Caf\u00e9 Richelieu at the [[Louvre]] in collaboration with Jean-Pierre Raynaud.\n\nSince the 1990s, Buren's work has become more architectural. He creates new spaces within existing environments such as city centers (''A Colored Square in the Sky'', 2007), public parks (''La Cabane \u00c9clat\u00e9e aux 4 Salles'', 2005), entire museums (''The Eye of the Storm'', 2005), and even beaches (''Le Vent soufle o\u00f9 il veut'', 2009).<ref>[http://www.crownpoint.com/artists/91/biographical-summary Daniel Buren] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928235717/http://www.crownpoint.com/artists/91/biographical-summary |date=28 September 2011 }} Crown Point Press, San Francisco.</ref> For ''Green and White Fence'' (1999/2001) Buren installed a functional fence sculpture, consisting of fence posts at four-meter intervals, painted green and white 87-millimeter stripes along a single ridge line: Since the first part's installation, the artist\u2019s theme has been extended until, over time, it will become the only form of fence on [[Alan Gibbs|Gibbs Farm]] in New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.gibbsfarm.org.nz/buren.php Daniel Buren] Gibbs Farm.</ref> In 2004, for the occasion of the opening of the French cultural year in China, Buren exhibited in his [[in situ]] installation ''De l'azur au Temple du Ciel'' (From the sky to Temple of Heaven) at [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing.<ref>[http://www.chengxindong.com/index.php?option=com_xdcsection&sectionid=4&task=artists1&catid=40&artid=12&Itemid=41&lang=en Daniel Buren] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029071516/http://www.chengxindong.com/index.php?option=com_xdcsection&sectionid=4&task=artists1&catid=40&artid=12&Itemid=41&lang=en |date=29 October 2011 }} Xin Dong Cheng Space for Contemporary Art, Beijing.</ref> ''A Rainbow in the Sky'' (2009) consisted of thousands of colorful pennant flags hovering over a busy pedestrian square in [[Pasadena, California]] for two months.<ref>[http://www.flaxfoundation.com/rainbow_in_the_sky ''A Rainbow in the Sky'', an outdoor installation by Daniel Buren, August 8 \u2013 November 15, 2009] Flax Foundation, Pasadena.</ref>\n\nBuren collaborated with [[Herm\u00e8s]] on a number of occasions.

Other artists, including [[Dan Flavin]] and [[Donald Judd]], protested that the banner blocked views across the rotunda, compromising their works. Buren, in turn, said Flavin's fluorescent lights colored his banner. The night before the opening, the banner was removed.<ref>[[Michael Kimmelman]] (25 March 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/25/arts/design/25KIMM.html Tall French Visitor Takes Up Residence in the Guggenheim]''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> Buren was later invited to participate in the [[Documenta]]s 5 through 7 (1972\u20131982).\n\nIn 1986, when [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] was president of France, Buren attained leading artist status after he created ''Les Deux Plateaux'' (1985\u201386), a work in situ for the [[Cour d'honneur]] at the [[Palais-Royal|Palais Royal]] in Paris.
