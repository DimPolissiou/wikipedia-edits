A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he served as [[Kentucky]] [[Attorney general]] from 2004 to 2008. He was the Democratic candidate for the [[2019 Kentucky Attorney General election|2019 election]] for Attorney General.\n\n==Background and education==\nStumbo graduated from the University of Kentucky, where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.{{fact|date=July 2019}} He then got his law degree from the University of Louisville.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Early career==\nA native of [[Prestonsburg, Kentucky|Prestonsburg]] in [[Floyd County, Kentucky|Floyd County]], Stumbo served as Assistant Floyd [[County Attorney]] and held the position of [[Martin, Kentucky|Martin]] [[City Attorney]] for three years. He also served as trial commissioner to the Floyd County District Court for one year.\n\nPrior to his election as attorney general, Stumbo served in the Kentucky House of Representatives for twelve terms, from 1980 to 2003. During this time Stumbo was Kentucky's longest-serving House Majority Leader (1985\u20132003). Stumbo returned to the House of Representatives not long after his Attorney General term ended.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]|url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article44449347.html|title=House Speaker Greg Stumbo pitching personal-injury law firm in TV commercials.|date=2013-10-17|author=John Cheves}}</ref>\n\n==Attorney General of Kentucky==\nStumbo's office led an investigation into the hiring practices of Kentucky [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor [[Ernie Fletcher]] which resulted in indictments, but was dismissed by agreement with the prosecutors. On September 12, 2007, Stumbo sued Fletcher for appointing too many Republicans to the governing bodies of state universities. State law requires \"proportional representation of the two leading political parties\" based on voter registration. A majority of registered voters in Kentucky are Democrats, but Fletcher appointed seven Republicans and two Democrats to the [[University of Kentucky]] and eight Republicans and two Democrats to the [[University of Louisville]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070912/NEWS01/70912016/1008|title=Stumbo sues Fletcher over board appointments|date=2007-09-12|author=Staff writer}}</ref>\n\nStumbo was also, in his time as Attorney General, known for leading a somewhat controversial and very effective attack on the sale of prescription drugs over the internet and through \"pill mills\", which led to the most stringent laws preventing these sales in the nation. The [[Electronic commerce#Government regulations|Ryan Haight Act]], the federal law that prohibits the internet-only-based sale of narcotic prescription drugs by these same websites was modeled on the law Stumbo passed in Kentucky. A large part of the controversy surrounding Stumbo's efforts to control the sale of internet \"prescriptions\" was based in the objections of other states, who saw Stumbo's efforts intruding on their own state sovereignty and authority, particularly in the states where the internet pharmacy sites were based. Stumbo also faced considerable criticism from pain patient's rights groups, particularly The Pain Relief Network and its president, Siobhan Reynolds, who threatened to file lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the proposed law. The suit was never filed and the law became the first in the nation requiring registration of internet pharmacies, wherever they were located, in the state in order for them to deliver any medication to Kentucky.\n\n[[2019 Kentucky Attorney General election|In 2019]], Stumbo became the Democratic nominee for Attorney General once again, running unopposed in the Democratic primary.

He also served as trial commissioner to the Floyd County District Court for one year.\n\nPrior to his election as attorney general, Stumbo served in the Kentucky House of Representatives for twelve terms, from 1980 to 2003. During this time Stumbo was Kentucky's longest-serving House Majority Leader (1985\u20132003).

On September 12, 2007, Stumbo sued Fletcher for appointing too many Republicans to the governing bodies of state universities. State law requires \"proportional representation of the two leading political parties\" based on voter registration. A majority of registered voters in Kentucky are Democrats, but Fletcher appointed seven Republicans and two Democrats to the [[University of Kentucky]] and eight Republicans and two Democrats to the [[University of Louisville]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070912/NEWS01/70912016/1008|title=Stumbo sues Fletcher over board appointments|date=2007-09-12|author=Staff writer}}</ref>\n\nStumbo was also, in his time as Attorney General, known for leading a somewhat controversial and very effective attack on the sale of prescription drugs over the internet and through \"pill mills\", which led to the most stringent laws preventing these sales in the nation. The [[Electronic commerce#Government regulations|Ryan Haight Act]], the federal law that prohibits the internet-only-based sale of narcotic prescription drugs by these same websites was modeled on the law Stumbo passed in Kentucky. A large part of the controversy surrounding Stumbo's efforts to control the sale of internet \"prescriptions\" was based in the objections of other states, who saw Stumbo's efforts intruding on their own state sovereignty and authority, particularly in the states where the internet pharmacy sites were based. Stumbo also faced considerable criticism from pain patient's rights groups, particularly The Pain Relief Network and its president, Siobhan Reynolds, who threatened to file lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the proposed law. The suit was never filed and the law became the first in the nation requiring registration of internet pharmacies, wherever they were located, in the state in order for them to deliver any medication to Kentucky.\n\n[[2019 Kentucky Attorney General election|In 2019]], Stumbo became the Democratic nominee for Attorney General once again, running unopposed in the Democratic primary.

According to a Catalyst report called \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\">Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008).

Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing is not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna |display-authors=etal | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}</ref>\n\nRacial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired.

Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or \"fitting in\" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.<ref>DuBow, Wendy M., et al. \"Bringing Young Women Into Computing Through The NCWIT Aspirationgs In Computing Program.\" Communications of the ACM 56.12 (2013): 34-37.

Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 \"Net New Women\" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:\n\n*[[Google]]: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010.\n*[[Intel]]: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training,\n*[[Virginia Tech]]: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs.\n<ref>\"Improving Gender Composition in Computing.\" Communications Of The ACM 55.4 (2012): 29-31.Business Source Premier.

McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women & Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women, or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohoon| first1 =  J.

Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72\u201379 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}</ref>\n\n[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that \"...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref>\n\nAnother argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing, according to Paul De Palma. In his article, \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science,\" he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who are usually given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other \"boy-related\" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore, more participation of women in the computer science field.<ref>De Palma, Paul. \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science.\" Communications Of the ACM 44.6 (2001): 27-29.

More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings.\n\nA two-year research initiative published in 2000 by [[AAUW]] found that \"Girls approach the computer as a \"tool\" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a \"toy\" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium.

Most people do not realize that the \"extra help\" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient.

According to a Catalyst report called \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\">Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008).

Catalyst.</ref> This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\" /> The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: \"I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work\".<ref name=\"catalyst.org\" />\n\nHowever, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\">(2003).

Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing is not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna |display-authors=etal | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}</ref>\n\nRacial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired. Non-white or Asian women may experience additional difficulty because they fail to match either half of the stereotype.<ref name=\"Ortutay 2017\">{{cite news|last1=Ortutay|first1=Barbara|title=Why is there so much attention but so little progress for diversity in tech?|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-diversity-tech-little-progress-ap-bsi-20170125-story.html|accessdate=30 Apr 2017|work=chicagotribune.com|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=25 Jan 2017}}</ref> Nonetheless, it has been found that a women\u2019s race is less likely to affect the probability of her choosing computing or a related field.<ref name=\"Trusty 2002\">{{cite journal|last1=Trusty|first1=Jerry|title=Effects of high school course-taking and other variables on choice of science and mathematics college majors.

Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age.<ref name=\"ramsey\"/> A specific example of this kind of program is the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers.

In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career-oriented topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html |title=Association for Women in Computing |publisher=Awc-hq.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as [[BCSWomen]], founded by [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], and the BCS Women's Forum.

Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or \"fitting in\" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.<ref>DuBow, Wendy M., et al. \"Bringing Young Women Into Computing Through The NCWIT Aspirationgs In Computing Program.\" Communications of the ACM 56.12 (2013): 34-37.

Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 \"Net New Women\" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:\n\n*[[Google]]: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010.\n*[[Intel]]: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training,\n*[[Virginia Tech]]: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs.\n<ref>\"Improving Gender Composition in Computing.\" Communications Of The ACM 55.4 (2012): 29-31.Business Source Premier.

McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women & Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women, or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohoon| first1 =  J.

Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72\u201379 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}</ref>\n\n[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that \"...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref>\n\nAnother argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing, according to Paul De Palma. In his article, \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science,\" he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who are usually given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other \"boy-related\" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore, more participation of women in the computer science field.<ref>De Palma, Paul. \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science.\" Communications Of the ACM 44.6 (2001): 27-29.

The album is dedicated to a fan, who passed away shortly before the album's release.  \n\nThe standard edition has no featured artists, and the deluxe edition features remixed tracks, with [[guest appearance]]s from [[Chromatics (band)|Chromatics]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]], along with additional production from [[The Blaze (band)|The Blaze]], [[Johnny Jewel]], and [[Oneohtrix Point Never|OPN]].

''After Hours'' will be promoted with [[the After Hours Tour]], which is set to span [[North America]] and [[Europe]].  \n\nThe artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as: ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'', ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'', and ''[[Uncut Gems]]''. The album was supported by three singles: \"[[Heartless (The Weeknd song)|Heartless]]\", \"[[Blinding Lights]]\", and \"[[In Your Eyes (The Weeknd song)|In Your Eyes]]\", with \"Heartless\" and \"Blinding Lights\" peaking at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Its [[After Hours (The Weeknd song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single.\n\n''After Hours'' received widespread acclaim, with some critics praising the album as The Weeknd's best piece of work. The album debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with 444,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, 275,000 of which were in pure sales.
