At this time, he married [[Anni Albers]] (n\u00e9e Fleischmann) who was a student there. His work in [[Dessau#The Bauhaus|Dessau]] included designing furniture and working with glass. As a younger instructor, he was teaching at the Bauhaus among established artists who included [[Oskar Schlemmer]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Paul Klee]]. The so-called \"form master\" Klee taught the formal aspects in the glass workshops where Albers was the \"crafts master;\" they cooperated for several years.\n\n===Emigration to the United States===\n====White Mountain College====\nWith the closure of the Bauhaus under [[Nazism|Nazi]] pressure in 1933 the artists dispersed, most leaving the country. Albers emigrated to the United States.

He also invited important American artists such as [[Willem de Kooning]], to teach in the summer seminar. Weil remarked that, as a teacher, Albers was \"his own academy\".

Albers also collaborated with Yale professor and architect [[King-lui Wu]] in creating decorative designs for some of Wu's projects. Among these were distinctive geometric [[fireplaces]] for the Rouse (1954) and DuPont (1959) houses, the fa\u00e7ade of [[Manuscript Society]], one of Yale's secret senior groups (1962), and a design for the Mt. Bethel Baptist Church (1973). Also, at this time he worked on his structural constellation pieces.\n\nIn 1963, he published ''Interaction of Color'' which presented his [[theory]] that colors were governed by an internal and deceptive logic. The very rare first edition has a limited printing of only 2,000 copies and contained 150 [[silk screen]] plates.  This work has been republished since and is now even available as an iPad App.  Also during this time, he created the abstract [[album covers]] of band leader [[Enoch Light]]'s [[Command LP]] records.

In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored [[Chromaticity|chromatic interactions]] with nested squares. Usually painting on [[Masonite]], he used a [[palette knife]] with oil colors and often recorded the colors he used on the back of his works. Each painting consists of either three or four squares of solid planes of color nested within one another, in one of four different arrangements and in square formats ranging from 406\u00d7406&nbsp;mm to 1.22\u00d71.22 m.<ref name=\"Josef Albers\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=97 Josef Albers] [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Manhattan]]</ref>\n\n===Murals===\n[[File:Albers \"Wrestling\" (1977).jpg|thumb|Albers \"Wrestling\" (1977) in Sydney]]\nIn 1959, a [[gold-leaf]] [[mural]] by Albers, ''Two Structural Constellations'' was engraved in the lobby of the [[Corning Glass|Corning Glass Building]] in [[Manhattan]].

In 1981, Alan Lee attempted to refute Albers' general claims about colour experience (that colour deceives continually) and to posit that Albers' system of perceptual education was fundamentally misleading.\n\nLee examined four topics in Albers' account of colour critically: additive and subtractive colour mixture; the tonal relations of colours; the [[Weber-Fechner Law]]; and simultaneous contrast. In each case Lee suggested that Albers made fundamental errors with serious consequences for his claims about colour and his pedagogical method. Lee suggested that Albers' belief in the importance of colour deception was related to a misconception about aesthetic appreciation (that it depends upon some kind of confusion about visual perception). Lee suggested that the scientific colour hypothesis of [[Edwin H. Land]] should be considered in lieu of the concepts put forward by Albers. Finally, Lee's called for a reassessment of Albers' art as necessary, following successful challenge to the foundational colour concepts that were the basis of his corpus.<ref>Lee, Alan. \"A Critical Account of Some of Josef Albers' Concepts of Color.\" ''Leonardo'' (1981): 99\u2013105.</ref><ref>Jameson, Dorothea. \"Some Misunderstandings about Color Perception, Color Mixture and Color Measurement\". ''Leonardo'', vol. 16, no. 1, 1983, pp. 41\u201342. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1575043.</ref>\n\nDorothea Jameson has challenged Lee's criticism of Albers, arguing that Albers' approach toward painting and pedagody emphasized artists' experiences in the handling and mixing of pigments, which often have different results than predicted by color theory experiments with projected light or spinning color disks. Furthermore, Jameson explains that Lee's own understanding of additive and subtractive color mixtures is flawed.<ref>Jameson, Dorothee.

Although Albers had studied painting, it was as a maker of stained glass that he joined the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1922, approaching his chosen medium as a component of architecture and as a stand-alone art form.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">[[Holland Cotter]] (July 26, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/arts/design/josef-albers-in-america-painting-on-paper-at-the-morgan.html Harmony, Harder Than It Looks \u2013 \u2018Josef Albers in America: Painting on Paper,\u2019 at the Morgan] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> The director and founder of the Bauhaus, [[Walter Gropius]], asked him in 1923 to teach in the preliminary course 'Werklehre' of the department of design to introduce newcomers to the principles of [[handicrafts]], because Albers came from that background and had appropriate practice and knowledge.\n\nIn 1925, the year the Bauhaus moved to [[Dessau]], Albers was promoted to professor. At this time, he married [[Anni Albers]] (n\u00e9e Fleischmann) who was a student there. His work in [[Dessau#The Bauhaus|Dessau]] included designing furniture and working with glass. As a younger instructor, he was teaching at the Bauhaus among established artists who included [[Oskar Schlemmer]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Paul Klee]]. The so-called \"form master\" Klee taught the formal aspects in the glass workshops where Albers was the \"crafts master;\" they cooperated for several years.\n\n===Emigration to the United States===\n====Black Mountain College====\nWith the closure of the Bauhaus under [[Nazism|Nazi]] pressure in 1933 the artists dispersed, most leaving the country. Albers emigrated to the United States. The architect [[Philip Johnson]], then a curator at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City, arranged for Albers to be offered a job as head of a new art school, [[Black Mountain College]], in [[North Carolina]].<ref>Pepe Carmel (June 25, 1995), [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/25/arts/art-view-a-modern-master-of-bottles-scraps-and-squares.html A Modern Master of Bottles, Scraps and Squares] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> In November 1933, he joined the faculty of the college where he was the head of the painting program until 1949.\n\nAt Black Mountain, his students included [[Ruth Asawa]], [[Ray Johnson]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Cy Twombly]], and [[Susan Weil]]. He also invited important American artists such as [[Willem de Kooning]], to teach in the summer seminar. Weil remarked that, as a teacher, Albers was \"his own academy\". She said that Albers claimed that \"when you're in school, you're not an artist, you're a student\", although he was very supportive of self-expression when one became an artist and began on her or his journey.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Susan Weil |author=Robert Ayers |work=Art+Auction |date=March 29, 2006 |url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/16817/susan-weil/ |accessdate=22 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308024926/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/16817/susan-weil/ |archivedate=March 8, 2008 }}</ref> Albers produced many [[woodcut]]s and leaf studies at this time.\n\n====Yale University====\n[[File:'Proto-Form (B)', oil on fiberboard work by Joseph Albers, 1938, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Josef Albers, ''Proto-Form (B),'' oil on [[fiberboard]], 1938, [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]]]]\n\nIn 1950, Albers left Black Mountain to head the department of design at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

Albers also collaborated with Yale professor and architect [[King-lui Wu]] in creating decorative designs for some of Wu's projects. Among these were distinctive geometric [[fireplaces]] for the Rouse (1954) and DuPont (1959) houses, the fa\u00e7ade of [[Manuscript Society]], one of Yale's secret senior groups (1962), and a design for the Mt. Bethel Baptist Church (1973). Also, at this time he worked on his structural constellation pieces.\n\nIn 1963, he published ''Interaction of Color'' which presented his [[theory]] that colors were governed by an internal and deceptive logic. The very rare first edition has a limited printing of only 2,000 copies and contained 150 [[silk screen]] plates.  This work has been republished since and is now even available as an iPad App.  Also during this time, he created the abstract [[album covers]] of band leader [[Enoch Light]]'s [[Command LP]] records.

He favored a very disciplined approach to [[composition (visual arts)|composition]]. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series, ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored [[Chromaticity|chromatic interactions]] with nested squares. Usually painting on [[Masonite]], he used a [[palette knife]] with oil colors and often recorded the colors he used on the back of his works. Each painting consists of either three or four squares of solid planes of color nested within one another, in one of four different arrangements and in square formats ranging from 406\u00d7406&nbsp;mm to 1.22\u00d71.22 m.<ref name=\"Josef Albers\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=97 Josef Albers] [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Manhattan]]</ref>\n\n===Murals===\n[[File:Albers \"Wrestling\" (1977).jpg|thumb|Albers \"Wrestling\" (1977) in Sydney]]\nIn 1959, a [[gold-leaf]] [[mural]] by Albers, ''Two Structural Constellations'' was engraved in the lobby of the [[Corning Glass|Corning Glass Building]] in [[Manhattan]]. For the entrance of the [[Time-Life Building|Time & Life Building]] lobby, he created ''Two Portals'' (1961), a 42-feet by 14-feet mural of alternating glass bands in white and brown that recede into two [[bronze]] centers to create an illusion of depth.<ref>David W.

The giant abstract mural of black, white, and red strips arranged in interwoven columns stood 28-feet high and 55-feet wide and was installed in the lobby of the building; it was removed during a lobby redesign in c. 2000.

In 1981, Alan Lee attempted to refute Albers' general claims about colour experience (that colour deceives continually) and to posit that Albers' system of perceptual education was fundamentally misleading.\n\nLee examined four topics in Albers' account of colour critically: additive and subtractive colour mixture; the tonal relations of colours; the [[Weber-Fechner Law]]; and simultaneous contrast. In each case Lee suggested that Albers made fundamental errors with serious consequences for his claims about colour and his pedagogical method. Lee suggested that Albers' belief in the importance of colour deception was related to a misconception about aesthetic appreciation (that it depends upon some kind of confusion about visual perception). Lee suggested that the scientific colour hypothesis of [[Edwin H. Land]] should be considered in lieu of the concepts put forward by Albers. Finally, Lee's called for a reassessment of Albers' art as necessary, following successful challenge to the foundational colour concepts that were the basis of his corpus.<ref>Lee, Alan. \"A Critical Account of Some of Josef Albers' Concepts of Color.\" ''Leonardo'' (1981): 99\u2013105.</ref><ref>Jameson, Dorothea. \"Some Misunderstandings about Color Perception, Color Mixture and Color Measurement\". ''Leonardo'', vol. 16, no. 1, 1983, pp. 41\u201342. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1575043.</ref>\n\nDorothea Jameson has challenged Lee's criticism of Albers, arguing that Albers' approach toward painting and pedagody emphasized artists' experiences in the handling and mixing of pigments, which often have different results than predicted by color theory experiments with projected light or spinning color disks. Furthermore, Jameson explains that Lee's own understanding of additive and subtractive color mixtures is flawed.<ref>Jameson, Dorothee.

{"title_page": "Somewhere (song)", "text_new": "{{About|the song from West Side Story|other uses|Somewhere (disambiguation){{!}}Somewhere}}\n{{refimprove|date=October 2014}}\n\"'''Somewhere'''\", sometimes referred to as \"'''Somewhere (There's a Place for Us)'''\" or simply \"'''There's a Place for Us'''\", is a song from the 1957 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' that was made into [[West Side Story (1961 film)|a film in 1961]]. The music is composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]] with lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]], and takes a phrase from the slow movement of [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 'Emperor' Piano Concerto]], which forms the start of the melody.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Alex|title=The Rest is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century|publisher=Fourth Estate|isbn=978-1-84115-475-6}}</ref> and also a longer phrase from the main theme of [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Swan Lake]].\n\n==The song in the stage musical==\nIn the [[West Side Story (musical)|stage musical]], the song appears in the second act of the show during the Somewhere Ballet. It is performed by an off-stage soprano singer and is later reprised by the entire company. In the original Broadway production, \"Somewhere\" was sung by [[Reri Grist]] who played the role of Consuelo.\n\nAt the end of the show, when Tony is shot, Maria sings the first few lines of the song as he dies in her arms.\n\nIn late 1957, this recording was released on the album ''[[West Side Story (Original Broadway Cast)]]''.\n\n==The song in the 1961 film==\nIn the [[West Side Story (1961 film)|1961 film]], the song occurs at a pivotal point, after the rumble in which Tony ([[Richard Beymer]]) has stabbed Maria's brother, Bernardo ([[George Chakiris]]). Having nowhere else to go, Tony runs to Maria ([[Natalie Wood]]), who has just been told of her brother's death and who killed him. When Tony comes to her room through the balcony window, Maria, in shock, pounds against his chest.\n\nRealizing in spite of her anger that she still loves Tony, Maria begs him to hold her. After Maria cries out, \"It's not us...it's everything around us.\" Tony replies, \"Then I'll take you away, where nothing can get to us.\" He then begins singing \"Somewhere\" to her. His comforting voice draws her in and it becomes a duet of hope that their love will survive \"somehow, someday, somewhere.\"\n\nAs in the stage show, Maria sings the first few lines of the song as Tony dies in her arms. In 2004, this version finished at #20 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] survey of top tunes in American cinema.\n\n\"Somewhere\" is the only track that is out of sequence on the [[West Side Story (soundtrack)|original soundtrack album]] as it is the last track on Side 2. This is rectified on the CD as \"Somewhere\" is correctly placed in sequence to the film between \"The Rumble\" and \"Cool.\"\n\n==P. J. Proby version==\nIn 1964, [[P. J. Proby]] released his version of \"Somewhere\", which reached number 6 on the British singles chart and 7 on the Australian singles chart. The song also charted well in various European countries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart positions \n!align=\"left\"|Peak <br>position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[UK Singles Chart]]\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[ARIA Charts|Australian Singles Chart]]\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|-\n|}\n\n==The Supremes' version==\nIn 1965, [[the Supremes]] recorded the song for their album, ''[[There's a Place for Us]]'', though it went unreleased until 2004. They also used it for their debut appearance at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] nightclub in New York City and it eventually became a fixture of their nightclub acts. They also sang the song on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]''. In contrast to the original melody, a special dramatic monologue was incorporated, which was frequently changed in conjunction with changes in the group as well as the country's turmoil in the late 1960s.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], the monologue was changed to reflect King's famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech. When the Supremes appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' the day after King had been murdered, lead singer [[Diana Ross]] was so overcome with emotion that she practically stumbled through the speech, but got an extraordinary ovation from the studio audience. It would once again be nationally televised several months later that year when the group paired up with [[the Temptations]] for an NBC television special, ''[[TCB (television special)|TCB]]''. The monologue for that special went as follows:<ref>{{cite web |title=The Supremes - Somewhere on Tonight Show (Audio Only) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZSOrQJbcRg |website=YouTube |publisher= |date=November 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\n'' \"Yes, there's a place for each of us,\n'' And we must try to pursue this place.\n'' Where love is like a passion, that burns like a fire,\n'' Let our efforts be as determined as that of Dr. Martin Luther King,\n'' Who had a dream that all God's children,\n'' Black men, white men, Jews, Gentiles, Protestants, and Catholics,\n'' Will join hands and sing that spiritual of all:\n'' \"Free at last! Great God, we are free at last!\" ''\n\n==Barbra Streisand version==\nIn 1985, [[Barbra Streisand]] released a version of \"Somewhere\" as a single off the [[Grammy Award]]-winning ''[[The Broadway Album]]''. In the US, it narrowly missed the Top 40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], peaking at number 43, but fared better on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|AC]], peaking at number 5. It was a dissapointment in the UK, peaking at number 88.<ref>[http://barbra-archives.com/record/albums/broadway_album.html Barbra Streisand Archives: Records/The Broadway Album.]</ref> The song itself won the [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocal(s)]]. In 2011, a duet was produced using scenes from Streisand's version while [[Jackie Evancho]] performed live with David Foster at the [[Ringling Museum of Art]]. On her 2014 ''[[Partners (Barbra Streisand album)|Partners]]'' album, she released a new recording of the song, this time as a duet with [[Josh Groban]].\n\n==Phil Collins version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Somewhere\n| cover      = Somewhere Phil Collins.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Phil Collins]]\n| album      = The Songs of West Side Story\n| released   = [[1996 in music|1996]]\n| format     = [[CD single|CD]], [[12-inch single|12\"]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Rock music|Rock]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=4|s=02}}\n| label      = [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Virgin Records|Virgin]], [[Warner Music Group|WEA]]\n| writer     = [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Stephen Sondheim]]\n| producer   = Phil Collins\n| prev_title = [[We Wait and We Wonder]]\n| prev_year  = 1994\n| next_title = [[Dance into the Light (song)|Dance into the Light]]\n| next_year  = 1996\n}}\n\nBritish drummer [[Phil Collins]] later covered the song in 1996 for the ''[[West Side Story]]'' cover album ''The Songs of West Side Story''.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n===Track listings===\n'''CD-Single'''\n# Somewhere (Radio Version Edit) - 3:58\t\n# Somewhere (Radio Version) - 4:17\t\n\n===Charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1996)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak <br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canadian Singles Chart \n|align=\"center\"|68\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|US ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]]\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|-\n|}\n\n==Pet Shop Boys version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Somewhere\n| cover      = SomewherePSB.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Pet Shop Boys]]\n| album      = [[Bilingual (album)|Bilingual Special Edition]]\n| A-side     = \"[[A Red Letter Day]]\" (US)\n| B-side     = \"The View from Your Balcony\", \"Disco Potential\"\n| released   = 23 June 1997\n| format     = [[CD single]], [[12-inch single|12\"]], [[cassette single]]\n| recorded   = 1995\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Hi-NRG]]<ref>{{cite news|first= Will |last= Dean |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/music-review-pet-shop-boys-bring-cornucopia-of-hits-to-londons-o2-arena-8664877.html |title= Music review: Pet Shop Boys bring cornucopia of hits to London's O2 Arena |newspaper= [[The Independent]] |date= June 19, 2013 |accessdate= March 31, 2015}}</ref>\n| length     = {{Duration|m=4|s=42}} <br> 10:56 (extended version)\n| label      = [[Parlophone]] / [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]\n| writer     = [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Stephen Sondheim]]\n| producer   = Pet Shop Boys\n| prev_title = [[A Red Letter Day]]\n| prev_year  = 1997\n| next_title = [[I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Any More]]\n| next_year  = 1999\n}}\n\"Somewhere\" was released as a single by the British music group [[Pet Shop Boys]] on 23 June 1997 to promote their \"Somewhere\" residency at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in London, which was named after the song, and to promote a repackage of ''[[Bilingual (album)|Bilingual]]''.\n\nThe single was another top 10 hit for the group, peaking at number 9.

The music is composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]] with lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]], and takes a phrase from the slow movement of [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 'Emperor' Piano Concerto]], which forms the start of the melody.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Alex|title=The Rest is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century|publisher=Fourth Estate|isbn=978-1-84115-475-6}}</ref> and also a longer phrase from the main theme of [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Swan Lake]].\n\n==The song in the stage musical==\nIn the [[West Side Story (musical)|stage musical]], the song appears in the second act of the show during the Somewhere Ballet. It is performed by an off-stage soprano singer and is later reprised by the entire company. In the original Broadway production, \"Somewhere\" was sung by [[Reri Grist]] who played the role of Consuelo.\n\nAt the end of the show, when Tony is shot, Maria sings the first few lines of the song as he dies in her arms.\n\nIn late 1957, this recording was released on the album ''[[West Side Story (Original Broadway Cast)]]''.\n\n==The song in the 1961 film==\nIn the [[West Side Story (1961 film)|1961 film]], the song occurs at a pivotal point, after the rumble in which Tony ([[Richard Beymer]]) has stabbed Maria's brother, Bernardo ([[George Chakiris]]). Having nowhere else to go, Tony runs to Maria ([[Natalie Wood]]), who has just been told of her brother's death and who killed him. When Tony comes to her room through the balcony window, Maria, in shock, pounds against his chest.\n\nRealizing in spite of her anger that she still loves Tony, Maria begs him to hold her. After Maria cries out, \"It's not us...it's everything around us.\" Tony replies, \"Then I'll take you away, where nothing can get to us.\" He then begins singing \"Somewhere\" to her. His comforting voice draws her in and it becomes a duet of hope that their love will survive \"somehow, someday, somewhere.\"\n\nAs in the stage show, Maria sings the first few lines of the song as Tony dies in her arms. In 2004, this version finished at #20 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] survey of top tunes in American cinema.\n\n\"Somewhere\" is the only track that is out of sequence on the [[West Side Story (soundtrack)|original soundtrack album]] as it is the last track on Side 2. This is rectified on the CD as \"Somewhere\" is correctly placed in sequence to the film between \"The Rumble\" and \"Cool.\"\n\n==P. J. Proby version==\nIn 1964, [[P. J. Proby]] released his version of \"Somewhere\", which reached number 6 on the British singles chart and 7 on the Australian singles chart. The song also charted well in various European countries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart positions \n!align=\"left\"|Peak <br>position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[UK Singles Chart]]\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[ARIA Charts|Australian Singles Chart]]\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|-\n|}\n\n==The Supremes' version==\nIn 1965, [[the Supremes]] recorded the song for their album, ''[[There's a Place for Us]]'', though it went unreleased until 2004. They also used it for their debut appearance at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] nightclub in New York City and it eventually became a fixture of their nightclub acts. They also sang the song on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]''. In contrast to the original melody, a special dramatic monologue was incorporated, which was frequently changed in conjunction with changes in the group as well as the country's turmoil in the late 1960s.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], the monologue was changed to reflect King's famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech. When the Supremes appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' the day after King had been murdered, lead singer [[Diana Ross]] was so overcome with emotion that she practically stumbled through the speech, but got an extraordinary ovation from the studio audience. It would once again be nationally televised several months later that year when the group paired up with [[the Temptations]] for an NBC television special, ''[[TCB (television special)|TCB]]''. The monologue for that special went as follows:<ref>{{cite web |title=The Supremes - Somewhere on Tonight Show (Audio Only) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZSOrQJbcRg |website=YouTube |publisher= |date=November 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\n'' \"Yes, there's a place for each of us,\n'' And we must try to pursue this place.\n'' Where love is like a passion, that burns like a fire,\n'' Let our efforts be as determined as that of Dr. Martin Luther King,\n'' Who had a dream that all God's children,\n'' Black men, white men, Jews, Gentiles, Protestants, and Catholics,\n'' Will join hands and sing that spiritual of all:\n'' \"Free at last! Great God, we are free at last!\" ''\n\n==Barbra Streisand version==\nIn 1985, [[Barbra Streisand]] released a version of \"Somewhere\" as a single off the [[Grammy Award]]-winning ''[[The Broadway Album]]''. In the US, it narrowly missed the Top 40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], peaking at number 43, but fared better on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|AC]], peaking at number 5. It was a dissapointment in the UK, peaking at number 88.<ref>[http://barbra-archives.com/record/albums/broadway_album.html Barbra Streisand Archives: Records/The Broadway Album.]</ref> The song itself won the [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocal(s)]]. In 2011, a duet was produced using scenes from Streisand's version while [[Jackie Evancho]] performed live with David Foster at the [[Ringling Museum of Art]]. On her 2014 ''[[Partners (Barbra Streisand album)|Partners]]'' album, she released a new recording of the song, this time as a duet with [[Josh Groban]].\n\n==Phil Collins version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Somewhere\n| cover      = Somewhere Phil Collins.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Phil Collins]]\n| album      = The Songs of West Side Story\n| released   = [[1996 in music|1996]]\n| format     = [[CD single|CD]], [[12-inch single|12\"]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Rock music|Rock]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=4|s=02}}\n| label      = [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Virgin Records|Virgin]], [[Warner Music Group|WEA]]\n| writer     = [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Stephen Sondheim]]\n| producer   = Phil Collins\n| prev_title = [[We Wait and We Wonder]]\n| prev_year  = 1994\n| next_title = [[Dance into the Light (song)|Dance into the Light]]\n| next_year  = 1996\n}}\n\nBritish drummer [[Phil Collins]] later covered the song in 1996 for the ''[[West Side Story]]'' cover album ''The Songs of West Side Story''.\n\n===Charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1996)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak <br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canadian Singles Chart \n|align=\"center\"|68\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|US ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]]\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|-\n|}\n\n==Pet Shop Boys version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Somewhere\n| cover      = SomewherePSB.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Pet Shop Boys]]\n| album      = [[Bilingual (album)|Bilingual Special Edition]]\n| A-side     = \"[[A Red Letter Day]]\" (US)\n| B-side     = \"The View from Your Balcony\", \"Disco Potential\"\n| released   = 23 June 1997\n| format     = [[CD single]], [[12-inch single|12\"]], [[cassette single]]\n| recorded   = 1995\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Hi-NRG]]<ref>{{cite news|first= Will |last= Dean |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/music-review-pet-shop-boys-bring-cornucopia-of-hits-to-londons-o2-arena-8664877.html |title= Music review: Pet Shop Boys bring cornucopia of hits to London's O2 Arena |newspaper= [[The Independent]] |date= June 19, 2013 |accessdate= March 31, 2015}}</ref>\n| length     = {{Duration|m=4|s=42}} <br> 10:56 (extended version)\n| label      = [[Parlophone]] / [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]\n| writer     = [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Stephen Sondheim]]\n| producer   = Pet Shop Boys\n| prev_title = [[A Red Letter Day]]\n| prev_year  = 1997\n| next_title = [[I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Any More]]\n| next_year  = 1999\n}}\n\"Somewhere\" was released as a single by the British music group [[Pet Shop Boys]] on 23 June 1997 to promote their \"Somewhere\" residency at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in London, which was named after the song, and to promote a repackage of ''[[Bilingual (album)|Bilingual]]''.\n\nThe single was another top 10 hit for the group, peaking at number 9.

Introduced in the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]], he is portrayed by [[Tony Dalton]], and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and [[Gordon Smith (screenwriter)|Gordon Smith]].\n\nLalo, a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]], is one of many nephews of drug kingpin [[Hector Salamanca]]. After Hector suffers a stroke, Lalo arrives from Mexico to help run the Salamanca family's drug operation and takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.\n\n== Conception and development ==\n[[File:Tony Dalton (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tony Dalton]]\n[[Tony Dalton]] made his first on-screen appearance as Lalo Salamanca in the fourth season episode \"[[Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|Coushatta]]\". The character was first mentioned in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", which also referenced the character \"Ignacio\" ([[Nacho Varga]]) and introduced the character [[Saul Goodman]] (Jimmy McGill).<ref name=\"bustle\" /> Prior to the show's airing, [[Vince Gilligan]] mentioned in an interview that the writers had envisioned Lalo to become a major character, acknowledging that, like on ''Breaking Bad'', they must \"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |title=Vince Gilligan Gives Us a Glimpse of Where Better Call Saul Is Headed |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rob |date=February 5, 2015 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081417/https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> However, Gilligan and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had difficulties in figuring in how to introduce the character properly. They considered him as a [[bogeyman]] around the second season when they started writing narrative to support the need for Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or other motivations. Gilligan believes this was more his fault for delaying on developing Lalo, as it was Gould that pushed on the need to introduce Lalo sooner into the story. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a equal foil for [[Gus Fring]], which lead to the casting of Dalton for the role who had the charmisa, charm and athletism they felt they needed for Lalo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |title=5 Burning Questions About the \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale&nbsp;\u2014 Answered |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421083848/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Den of Geek]]'', [[Michael Mando]] (who portrays Nacho) described the character of Lalo as \"a Salamanca in every way, just like [[Tuco Salamanca|Tuco]] and [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]] had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/better-call-saul/275809/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path |title=Better Call Saul Season 4: Nacho's Dark Path |last=Kurland |first=Daniel |date=August 21, 2018 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081528/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode \"[[Wiedersehen]]\", written by [[Gennifer Hutchison]], fleshes out Lalo further.

The character was first mentioned in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", which also referenced the character \"Ignacio\" ([[Nacho Varga]]) and introduced the character [[Saul Goodman]] (Jimmy McGill).<ref name=\"bustle\" /> Prior to the show's airing, [[Vince Gilligan]] mentioned in an interview that the writers had envisioned Lalo to become a major character, acknowledging that, like on ''Breaking Bad'', they must \"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |title=Vince Gilligan Gives Us a Glimpse of Where Better Call Saul Is Headed |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rob |date=February 5, 2015 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081417/https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> However, Gilligan and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had difficulties in figuring in how to introduce the character properly. They considered him as a [[bogeyman]] around the second season when they started writing narrative to support the need for Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or other motivations. Gilligan believes this was more his fault for delaying on developing Lalo, as it was Gould that pushed on the need to introduce Lalo sooner into the story. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a equal foil for [[Gus Fring]], which lead to the casting of Dalton for the role who had the charmisa, charm and athletism they felt they needed for Lalo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |title=5 Burning Questions About the \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale&nbsp;\u2014 Answered |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421083848/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Den of Geek]]'', [[Michael Mando]] (who portrays Nacho) described the character of Lalo as \"a Salamanca in every way, just like [[Tuco Salamanca|Tuco]] and [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]] had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/better-call-saul/275809/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path |title=Better Call Saul Season 4: Nacho's Dark Path |last=Kurland |first=Daniel |date=August 21, 2018 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081528/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode \"[[Wiedersehen]]\", written by [[Gennifer Hutchison]], fleshes out Lalo further.

{"title_page": "Weigh station", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=April 2010}}\nA '''weigh station''' is a checkpoint along a highway to inspect vehicular weights. Usually, [[truck]]s and [[commercial vehicle]]s are subject to the inspection.\n\nWeigh stations are equipped with [[truck scale]]s, some of which are [[weigh in motion]] and permit the trucks to continue moving while being weighed, while older scales require the trucks to stop. There are many different scales used, from single axle scales to multi-axle sets. Signal lights indicate if the driver should pull over for additional inspection or if they are allowed to return to the highway.\n\nMany jurisdictions employ the use of portable scales, allowing weigh stations to be set up at any point. Portable scales allow states to set up temporary scales for situations such as seasonal check points, temporary checkpoints on isolated roads often used by trucks, or to prevent drivers from avoiding scales at fixed locations. Portable scales may be set up at purpose built locations that are not normally manned. A common reason for setting up portable scales is to monitor trucks during harvest season.\n\n==United States==\n{{CSS image crop\n|Image = WeighStationSign.jpg\n|bSize = 500\n|cWidth = 220\n|cHeight = 150\n|oTop = 120\n|oLeft = 60\n|Description = [[Road signs in the United States#R13 Series: Weigh Stations|Road signs]], like this one on [[Interstate 70 in Colorado]], typically indicate that a weigh station is upcoming, and a signal indicates whether it is open.\n}}\nA weigh station located near a state border is called a [[port of entry]]. States may also locate weigh stations in the interior of the state. Interior weigh stations are often located at choke points or areas where freight originates or is delivered. \n\nWeigh stations were primarily created to collect road use taxes before [[International Fuel Tax Agreement|IFTA]] created an integrated system of doing so. While taxes can still be paid at weigh stations, their primary function is now enforcement of tax and safety regulations. These include checking freight carrier compliance with [[fuel tax]] laws; checking weight restrictions; checking equipment safety; and checking compliance with hours of service regulations. Weigh stations are regulated by individual state governments and therefore have vastly different requirements from state to state. They are typically operated by the state's [[Department of Transportation]] (DOT) or [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] (DMV) in conjunction with the state [[highway patrol]] or [[state police]], thus enabling enforcement of applicable laws. The federal maximum weight is set at 80,000 [[pounds (mass)|pounds]]. Trucks exceeding the federal weight limit can still operate on the country's highways with an overweight permit, but such permits are only issued before the scheduled trip and expire at the end of the trip. Overweight permits are only issued for loads that cannot be broken down to smaller shipments that fall below the federal weight limit, and if there is no other alternative to moving the cargo by truck. Permitted oversize trucks are often required to coordinate with the departments of transportation and law enforcement agencies of the transited states before the trip begins, as most states require oversize trucks to be [[escort vehicle|escorted]]. Many states have [[weigh in motion]] technology that allow a continuous flow of truck weighing.\n\nMany states also check freight paperwork, vehicle paperwork, and logbooks to ensure that fuel taxes have been paid and that truck drivers are obeying the [[hours of service]] (a federal requirement). Also, the truck and driver may have to undergo a DOT inspection, as most states perform the bulk of their DOT inspections at their weigh stations. In some cases, if a truck is found to be overweight, the vehicle is ordered to stop until the situation can be fixed by acquiring an overweight permit. In other cases, the driver may receive an overweight ticket and may or may not be required to offload the extra freight. Offloading the extra freight may not be practical for perishable or hazardous loads. The first state to implement a weight law was [[Maine]], which set a limit of 18,000 [[pounds (mass)|pounds]] (9 tons; 8,200&nbsp;kg) in 1918.\n\nTwo types of loads may result in overweight trucks: divisible and non-divisible. A divisible load is a load which can be easily divided into smaller parts, such as products that are shipped on pallets, automobiles or grains. A non-divisible load is a load which is unable to be divided into smaller parts, like a piece of equipment or a steel beam. All states provide permits for non-divisible loads though the truck may have restricted routing. Some states allow tolerances for any over weight truck. Some states have specific allowances for types of loads for which they will allow tolerances. For example, Wyoming allows 2000 pounds for chains, tarps and [[dunnage]] that accompany a non-divisible load.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coopsareopen.com/news/overweight-in-wyoming.html |title=Overweight in Wyoming? |publisher=Coopsareopen.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}</ref>\n\nTruckers often refer to weigh stations as \"chicken coops.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coopsareopen.com/news/truck-driver-chicken-obsession.html |title=Chicken Obsessions |publisher=Coopsareopen.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}</ref>\n\n===Electronic weigh station bypass===\nMany states now use electronic bypass systems (or AVI - Automatic Vehicle Identification) to alleviate some of the truck traffic through the weigh station. Some of the best known are [[PrePass]], [[NORPASS]] and [[Drivewyze]]. The system may consist of equipment at the weigh station itself, as well as a truck mounted [[transponder]] or [[smartphone]], usually placed on the inside of the windshield or on the dashboard. These are similar to transponders used for [[toll road|toll collection]]. Each transponder is directly registered to a specific truck, and contains a unique identification. The registration process propagates information such as carrier name, unit number, and elected gross weight to weigh stations. In addition, the system keeps a basic safety and compliance record for each vehicle. As a truck approaches a weigh station (approximately one mile before), an electronic \"reader\" on a boom over the freeway reads the information from the truck transponder. It also looks at the [[motor carrier safety rating|safety and compliance record]] on the database. A display shows the results to the weigh master, including the speed of the vehicle. The weigh master may have the system automatically determine if a truck needs to stop or may override the system. Approximately one-half to one full mile after passing under the \"reader\", the truck will pass under another boom which has an electronic unit to send the transponder a signal. If the safety information is acceptable the truck may receive a green light and can continue without entering the weigh station at all. There are weight detecting devices in the roadway itself. A driver may get a red light. On these occasions, the truck must pull into the weigh station for the normal weigh-in procedure. The most common reason a truck is \"redlighted\" is a weight problem, or a random check. Each time a truck is randomly pulled in, it is noted in the system whether the driver was compliant or not during the check. This affects how often a truck (or different trucks from the same company) is pulled in. For example, a company which is very compliant with the law will probably only have 5% of its trucks \"redlighted.\"\n\n==Canada==\n===British Columbia===\nWeigh Stations (aka \"Scales\") are usually on the right-hand side of the travelled highway, but median scales are appearing (as of 2005) on divided highways, often combined with \"weigh-in-motion\" technology.\n\nA median scale is placed between the opposing lanes of traffic, necessitating heavy vehicles exiting from the left lane (rather than the right) and re-entering traffic from the left, potentially at a lower speed than the normal \"free-flow\" traffic would expect in the left (often thought of as \"fast\") lane.\n\n\"Weigh-in-motion\" technology allows heavy vehicles that do not exceed limits of weight (and size) to pass the scale, thus improving both freight and weigh scale operation efficiency.\n\n===Alberta===\nIn Alberta, scales can be on either side of the road, on the median or off-highway. Flashing lights inform drivers as to whether the scale is operational. Occasionally, the lights may be operational in only one direction.\n\nAlberta scales are all of the 'weigh-in-motion' type, and vehicles are not required to stop; they merely have to slow to 10&nbsp;km/h.\n\nScales which are not operational are often available to drivers as a 'self-weigh' site, where drivers can check their axle loads without enforcement officials being involved.\n\n===North West Territories===\nThe government of the North West Territories operates only one scale. It is situated in the townsite of Enterprise, 83 kilometres north of the border with Alberta, and issues permits for vehicles from other jurisdictions as well as weighing vehicles and enforcing hours of service legislation.\n\n==Taiwan==\n[[Image:Taiwan road sign Art060.4.png|thumb|A weigh station sign in Taiwan with Chinese text reading: \"trucks are to be weighed\"]]\n\nIn Taiwan, weigh stations ({{zh|\u5730\u78c5\u7ad9|links=no}}) are located on major highways, especially at all [[toll booths]] on [[freeway]]s. Advanced signs tell that trucks must enter the weigh stations when the attached lights are flashing, usually when tolls are collected.\n\nSince the [[National Highway 1 (Taiwan)|National Highway 1]] was built with older designs, all weigh stations have older scales so trucks must stop. Weigh stations along the [[National Highway 3 (Taiwan)|National Highway 3]] have weigh-in-motion scales at 7 central and southern toll stations, but northern stations at [[Cidu]], [[Shulin]], and [[Longtan District, Taoyuan|Longtan]] have traditional scales where trucks must stop.\n\nThe Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau applies for periodical inspections of truck scales every three months.<ref>Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau: [http://www.freeway.gov.tw/14_content.asp?SID=25&Item=13&ord=13 Frequently asked questions] {{in lang|zh}}</ref> Truckers entering a weigh-in-motion scale are advised not to accelerate or decelerate suddenly, or they may be required to be weighed again.<ref>Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau: [http://www.freeway.gov.tw/IMAGES/drvsafe/28_03.PDF Safe Driving Guide] {{in lang|zh}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Commercial Vehicle Inspection]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Weigh stations}}\n* [http://www.coopsareopen.com United States Truck Weigh Stations and Scales]\n* [http://www.coopsopen.com Truck Weigh Stations and Scales Real Time Status]\n\n[[Category:Freight transport]]\n[[Category:Industrial buildings]]\n[[Category:Road infrastructure]]\n[[Category:Weighing instruments]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=April 2010}}\nA '''weigh station''' is a checkpoint along a highway to inspect vehicular weights.

It is situated in the townsite of Enterprise, 83 kilometres north of the border with Alberta, and issues permits for vehicles from other jurisdictions as well as weighing vehicles and enforcing hours of service legislation.\n\n==Taiwan==\n[[Image:Taiwan road sign Art060.4.png|thumb|A weigh station sign in Taiwan with Chinese text reading: \"trucks are to be weighed\"]]\n\nIn Taiwan, weigh stations ({{zh|\u5730\u78c5\u7ad9|links=no}}) are located on major highways, especially at all [[toll booths]] on [[freeway]]s. Advanced signs tell that trucks must enter the weigh stations when the attached lights are flashing, usually when tolls are collected.\n\nSince the [[National Highway 1 (Taiwan)|National Highway 1]] was built with older designs, all weigh stations have older scales so trucks must stop. Weigh stations along the [[National Highway 3 (Taiwan)|National Highway 3]] have weigh-in-motion scales at 7 central and southern toll stations, but northern stations at [[Cidu]], [[Shulin]], and [[Longtan District, Taoyuan|Longtan]] have traditional scales where trucks must stop.\n\nThe Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau applies for periodical inspections of truck scales every three months.<ref>Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau: [http://www.freeway.gov.tw/14_content.asp?SID=25&Item=13&ord=13 Frequently asked questions] {{in lang|zh}}</ref> Truckers entering a weigh-in-motion scale are advised not to accelerate or decelerate suddenly, or they may be required to be weighed again.<ref>Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau: [http://www.freeway.gov.tw/IMAGES/drvsafe/28_03.PDF Safe Driving Guide] {{in lang|zh}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Commercial Vehicle Inspection]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Weigh stations}}\n* [http://www.coopsareopen.com United States Truck Weigh Stations and Scales]\n* [http://www.coopsopen.com Truck Weigh Stations and Scales Real Time Status]\n\n[[Category:Freight transport]]\n[[Category:Industrial buildings]]\n[[Category:Road infrastructure]]\n[[Category:Weighing instruments]]\n", "name_user": "Ohms law", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUnited States:fixed \"road signs\" wlink", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weigh_station"}
