Her mother later died.\n\nMuthu Manikkam accommodated her in one of his houses and fed her. Soon, Muthu Manikkam had an eye on her. He went to her house the night whenever he wanted. The rumour abounded that Muthu Manikkam and Otta Rosa had an affair. Later, Kattaalai's wedding was cancelled when the bride's family came to know about his illness.

Bulgaria took the lead in the 11th minute with a goal from [[Stiliyan Petrov]]. [[Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107]] scored in the 61st minute to tie the game, before [[Igor Burzanovi\u0107]] put Montenegro ahead 82nd minute from a penalty. However, a last-minute equalizer from [[Blagoy Georgiev]] denied Montenegro their first competitive win. In their next match on 10 September, they achieved another notable result when they held the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] to a 0\u20130 draw.<br>\nAnother near-upset came in a narrow 2\u20131 loss against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. After [[Alberto Aquilani]]'s early strike, Vu\u010dini\u0107 quickly equalized, but Aquilani scored the winning goal ten minutes later. Their second match against Italy ended 2\u20130 in favour of the world champions. Another disappointment came when the team could only draw 0\u20130 against [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]], followed by a 2\u20132 draw against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] after being two goals down. On 5 September 2009, Montenegro took an early lead against Bulgaria in [[Sofia]] with [[Stevan Joveti\u0107]] putting them 1\u20130 up, only for Bulgaria to recover and win 4\u20131. After drawing 1\u20131 with Cyprus, Montenegro finally registered their first competitive win, beating Georgia 2\u20131. They then drew 0\u20130 with the Republic of Ireland at [[Croke Park]]. They finished fifth in the group with nine points, below Cyprus on goal difference.\n\n===Golden era===\n[[File:Stevan Jovetic 2012 MNE.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Stevan Joveti\u0107]]\nDuring the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|qualification campaign]], the team recorded further success. They opened their campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over [[Wales national football team|Wales]]; [[Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107]] scored the only goal. A few days later, the team defeated Bulgaria 1\u20130 in Sofia. The next month, they beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 1\u20130 and then recorded a 0\u20130 draw in [[London]] against [[England national football team|England]]. On 4 June 2011, Montenegro drew 1\u20131 against Bulgaria, with [[Radomir \u0110alovi\u0107]] scoring for Montenegro early in the second half, but [[Ivelin Popov]] scoring minutes later, to keep Montenegro second in the group, behind England on goal difference.<br>\nMontenegro were beaten 2\u20131 by Wales in [[Cardiff]]. They were still second in Group G, but Switzerland closed the gap between them to only three points.<br>\nIn the June 2011 FIFA rankings, Montenegro recorded their highest ranking of 16th.<br>\nOn 7 October, Montenegro came back from 2\u20130 down to draw 2\u20132 against England in Podgorica, after [[Wayne Rooney]] was sent off. Wales beat Switzerland 2\u20130 to ensure Montenegro won a play-off place, putting the team two matches away from qualifying for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]. In their last match in the qualifiers, Montenegro lost 2\u20130 to Switzerland in [[Basel]]. On 13 October, the draw for the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying play-offs]] was held in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]]. Montenegro were paired with the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], but they lost 3\u20130 on aggregate and failed to qualify.<br>\nMontenegro were drawn in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group H|Group H]] in the qualifiers, along with England, [[Poland national football team|Poland]], [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] and [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]].<br>\nIn their first match, Montenegro tied against Poland in a 2\u20132 draw.

In their last match in 2012, Montenegro faced San Marino in Podgorica on 14 November, and won 3\u20130.\n<br>\nMontenegro played their fifth qualifier match against Moldova in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] on 22 March 2013, winning 1\u20130 through Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107's goal. Montenegro then returned to Podgorica to play the second-placed England. The outcome was a 1\u20131 draw.\n<br>\nLeading their World Cup qualifying group, Montenegro hosted Ukraine on 7 June 2013. They suffered their first defeat in the group, losing 4\u20130. The match also saw Montenegro finish the match with nine men after [[Vladimir Volkov]] and [[Savo Pavi\u0107evi\u0107]] were sent off. Their last four matches yielded just a single point; a 1\u20131 draw in Poland. Their 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign finished with a 5\u20132 home defeat to Moldova, and they finished third behind England and Ukraine.\n\n===Ups and downs===\nOn 23 February 2014 in [[Nice]], Montenegro were drawn for qualification in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group G|Group G]] alongside [[Russia national football team|Russia]], [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], [[Austria national football team|Austria]], Moldova and [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]]. Though they opened their campaign with a 2\u20130 win over Moldova, they failed to qualify with a 0\u20130 tie against Liechtenstein, a 1\u20130 loss to Austria and a 1\u20131 tie at home to Sweden.<br>\nOn 27 March 2015, Montenegro's home match against Russia was abandoned after 67 minutes due to crowd violence, after the Russian [[left-back]] [[Dmitri Kombarov]] was hit by a projectile. The score was 0\u20130 and Russia had missed a penalty moments before the match was abandoned. The Russian goalkeeper [[Igor Akinfeev]] was hit by a flare, causing a second 33-minute delay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-arrests-fans-for-football-match-bowl|title=Montenegro Arrests Fans for Football Violence|website=balkaninsight.com|publisher=Balkan Insight|date=31 March 2015|accessdate=18 September 2016}}</ref> The abandoned match was ruled a 3\u20130 win in Russia's favour.<br>\nMontenegro finished fourth at the end of the campaign and placed 95th on the FIFA ranking list.<br>\nMontenegro participated in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group E|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] and were placed with Poland, [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]], [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] and [[Romania national football team|Romania]]. Poland and Romania had been participants in the [[UEFA Euro 2016]], but Montenegro began by drawing 1\u20131 away to Romania, beating Kazakhstan 5\u20130 at home and defeating Denmark 1\u20130. However, they then lost 3\u20132 away to Armenia despite leading 2\u20130, and were defeated 2\u20131 at home by Poland. Montenegro then rebounded, beating Armenia 4\u20131 and Kazakhstan 3\u20130. They later eliminated Romania with a 1\u20130 victory, but losses to the Danes and Poles ended Montenegro's chance of qualifying.<br>\nHaving failed to reach the World Cup, Montenegro had a dismal performance in the [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League C]]. The team was grouped with [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]]. Montenegro only managed two victories, all against Lithuania, and suffered two losses to Serbia, one defeat to Romania at home and an away draw to the Romanian side as well. This effectively denied Montenegro a chance to qualify to the [[UEFA Euro 2020]] playoff.\n\n===Worst campaign===\nThe [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying Group A|EURO 2020 qualifiers]] for Montenegro have been the worst in the team's short history. After unsuccessful [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League C|Nations League]] campaign, the team started off with a 1\u20131 away draw to Bulgaria, following a controversial penalty for the hosts. It was followed with a 1\u20135 loss at home to England despite having taken an early lead. <br>\nOn the day of the match with [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], Serbian coach [[Ljubi\u0161a Tumbakovi\u0107]] and two players originated from Serbia, due to political reasons, abandoned the national team, betraying the squad in unprecedented condition before the two crucial matches for qualifiers. Montenegro managed to avoid defeat against Kosovo (1-1), however they lost to Czech Republic 0\u20133. The same result occurred in the rematch, one month later. With no chances to qualify directly, Montenegro failed to win the match against last placed Bulgaria (0-0), and lost to Kosovo (0-2).<br>\nAt the end of their worst campaign, Montenegro suffered the biggest defeat in history. On 14th November 2019, they were defeated against England in [[London]] 7-0.<br>\nExcept the fact that they finished qualifiers without single victory, Montenegro scored only three goals on eight matches, and conceded 22. Also, throughout the entire qualifying campaign the team had troubles with injuries of the key players, especially [[Stevan Joveti\u0107]] and [[Stefan Savi\u0107]].\n\n==FIFA rankings==\n{{Main|Montenegro national football team records and statistics}}\nMontenegro national football team is present on [[FIFA rankings]] since June 2007.

The team's nickname is \"The Brave Falcons\" ({{lang-cnr|Hrabri Sokoli|italics=yes}}).\n\n===Stadium===\n{{Main|Podgorica City Stadium}}\nMontenegro play home matches at the [[Podgorica City Stadium]] ({{lang-cnr|Stadion pod Goricom|italics=yes}}). The stadium's capacity is 15,230, but international matches reduce this to between 10,700 and 13,000.\n\n===Camp FSCG===\n{{main|Camp FSCG}}\nThe Football Association of Montenegro owns Camp FSCG, a Montenegrin training ground. Built in 2007, the centre has a total area of 54,000 square metres.<ref>http://www.podgorica.me/sport</ref> It is located on ''\u0106emovsko polje'', a plain located in the outskirts of Podgorica outskirts between the settlements of [[Stari Aerodrom]] and [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]]. It consists of six pitches with stands and floodlights,<ref>http://fscg.me/istorija-savez/investicije</ref> and ''House of Football'' \u2013 the seat of the Football Association of Montenegro.<ref>http://cdm.me/sport/fudbal/video-zavirite-u-novu-kucu-fudbala/</ref>\n\nThe camp currently represents an important asset for the whole Montenegrin football system. The grounds are home to all Montenegrin national teams (men and women) and numerous local teams from Podgorica. CAMP FSCG meets the criteria for [[Montenegrin First League]] games and [[UEFA]] competitions for young players.\n\n===Kit===\nThe team kit is produced by the Italian company [[Legea]]. It is all-red with gold details to reflect the colours of the [[Flag of Montenegro|Montenegrin national flag]]. Before that, the kit providers were ''daCapo''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FF0000\"| <span style=\"color:white\">Manufacturer</span>\n!style=\"background:#FF0000\"| <span style=\"color:white\">Period</span>\n|-\n|align=\"Left\"| {{flagicon|SRB}} ''daCapo'' ||2007\u20132008\n|-\n|align=\"Left\"| {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Legea]] ||2008\u2013present\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FF0000\" colspan=2|\n|}\n\n===Supporters===\nAt competitive matches, the Montenegrin home ground [[Podgorica City Stadium]] is often filled to capacity. The stadium is regarded as too small to meet the needs of the national team. Demand for the World Cup qualifier against Italy in 2009 was 30,000 tickets; 40,000 for the Euro 2012 qualifying match against England in 2011.\n\nMontenegro's loudest and most loyal supporters are named ''Ultra Crna Gora'' (\u0423\u043b\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430; ''Ultra Montenegro''). As an [[ultras]] group, their support consists of standing up and singing for 90 minutes both home and away. They occupy the north and south stands of [[Podgorica City Stadium]]. Choreography is usually performed at the beginning of games. ''Ultra Crna Gora'' consists of many subgroups, mostly named after Podgorica's neighborhoods and [[List of cities in Montenegro|Montenegrin towns]] in other parts of the country.\n\n==Players==\nIn [[FIFA|international football]], players can normally only play for one national team once they play in all or part of any match recognised as a full international by [[FIFA]]. However, an exception is made in cases where one or more newly independent states are created out of a former state. Based on current FIFA rules, a player will be eligible to play for Montenegro, even if he had previously represented Serbia and Montenegro or any other country, if at least one of the following statements applies:<ref>https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/status%5ftransfer%5fen%5f25.pdf</ref>\n\n*The player was born in Montenegro;\n*At least one of their parents and/or at least one of their grandparents was born in Montenegro;\n*The player has lived in Montenegro continuously for any five-year period.\n\nDue to mixed ancestries, it is likely that a high percentage of the players eligible to play for Montenegro will also remain eligible to play for Serbia, and vice versa. However, once they have played for either Serbia or Montenegro in any competitive fixture, they are no longer eligible to play for any other nation.\n\n===Current squad===\nThe following players were called up for [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying|Euro 2020 qualifying]] game against [[England national football team|England]] on 14 November and friendly match against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] on 19 November 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fscg.me/vijesti/7239/spisak-sokola-za-meceve-sa-engleskom-i-bjelorusijom|title=''SPISAK \u201eSOKOLA\u201c ZA ME\u010cEVE SA ENGLESKOM I

It is controlled by the [[Football Association of Montenegro]], the governing body for [[football in Montenegro]]. Montenegro's home ground is [[Podgorica City Stadium]] in [[Podgorica]].\n\nMontenegro is one of the world's newest international teams, having joined FIFA and UEFA in 2007, following the restoration of [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Montenegrin independence]] in 2006.\n\nMontenegro played its first official international match against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in March 2007, and competed in their first [[FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|2010]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\n[[File:Montenegro line-up, Czech Rp.-Montenegro EURO 2020 QR 10-06-2019.jpg|thumb|right|Montenegro national team squad in EURO 2020 qualifiers]]\nFollowing the independence of Montenegro from [[Serbia and Montenegro]], Serbia was set to represent both Serbia and Montenegro in the [[2008 European Football Championship|Euro 2008]] qualifying stage. [[UEFA]], however, would be willing to include Montenegro as a late entry if [[FIFA]] ratified a separate [[Montenegrin Football Association]] before September 2006.

In 23 matches, Filipovi\u0107 recorded eight victories, eight draws and seven defeats. He left in January 2010 when his contract expired. During his tenure, Montenegro rose to 73rd position in the FIFA rankings.<br>\nMontenegro played at the 2007 [[Kirin Cup]], but finished in last place behind [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]].<br>\nOn 26 March 2008, Montenegro recorded one of its best results with a 3\u20131 win over [[Norway national football team|Norway]].\n\n===First competitive matches===\nOn 6 September 2008, Montenegro played their first World Cup qualifier against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] at the Podgorica City Stadium. Bulgaria took the lead in the 11th minute with a goal from [[Stiliyan Petrov]]. [[Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107]] scored in the 61st minute to tie the game, before [[Igor Burzanovi\u0107]] put Montenegro ahead 82nd minute from a penalty. However, a last-minute equalizer from [[Blagoy Georgiev]] denied Montenegro their first competitive win. In their next match on 10 September, they achieved another notable result when they held the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] to a 0\u20130 draw.<br>\nAnother near-upset came in a narrow 2\u20131 loss against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. After [[Alberto Aquilani]]'s early strike, Vu\u010dini\u0107 quickly equalized, but Aquilani scored the winning goal ten minutes later. Their second match against Italy ended 2\u20130 in favour of the world champions. Another disappointment came when the team could only draw 0\u20130 against [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]], followed by a 2\u20132 draw against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] after being two goals down. On 5 September 2009, Montenegro took an early lead against Bulgaria in [[Sofia]] with [[Stevan Joveti\u0107]] putting them 1\u20130 up, only for Bulgaria to recover and win 4\u20131. After drawing 1\u20131 with Cyprus, Montenegro finally registered their first competitive win, beating Georgia 2\u20131. They then drew 0\u20130 with the Republic of Ireland at [[Croke Park]]. They finished fifth in the group with nine points, below Cyprus on goal difference.\n\n===Golden era===\n[[File:Stevan Jovetic 2012 MNE.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Stevan Joveti\u0107]]\nDuring the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|qualification campaign]], the team recorded further success. They opened their campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over [[Wales national football team|Wales]]; [[Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107]] scored the only goal. A few days later, the team defeated Bulgaria 1\u20130 in Sofia. The next month, they beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 1\u20130 and then recorded a 0\u20130 draw in [[London]] against [[England national football team|England]]. On 4 June 2011, Montenegro drew 1\u20131 against Bulgaria, with [[Radomir \u0110alovi\u0107]] scoring for Montenegro early in the second half, but [[Ivelin Popov]] scoring minutes later, to keep Montenegro second in the group, behind England on goal difference.<br>\nMontenegro were beaten 2\u20131 by Wales in [[Cardiff]]. They were still second in Group G, but Switzerland closed the gap between them to only three points.<br>\nIn the June 2011 FIFA rankings, Montenegro recorded their highest ranking of 16th.<br>\nOn 7 October, Montenegro came back from 2\u20130 down to draw 2\u20132 against England in Podgorica, after [[Wayne Rooney]] was sent off. Wales beat Switzerland 2\u20130 to ensure Montenegro won a play-off place, putting the team two matches away from qualifying for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]. In their last match in the qualifiers, Montenegro lost 2\u20130 to Switzerland in [[Basel]]. On 13 October, the draw for the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying play-offs]] was held in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]]. Montenegro were paired with the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], but they lost 3\u20130 on aggregate and failed to qualify.<br>\nMontenegro were drawn in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group H|Group H]] in the qualifiers, along with England, [[Poland national football team|Poland]], [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] and [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]].<br>\nIn their first match, Montenegro tied against Poland in a 2\u20132 draw. On 11 September, Montenegro played against San Marino in [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Seravalle]].

In their last match in 2012, Montenegro faced San Marino in Podgorica on 14 November, and won 3\u20130.\n<br>\nMontenegro played their fifth qualifier match against Moldova in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] on 22 March 2013, winning 1\u20130 through Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107's goal. Montenegro then returned to Podgorica to play the second-placed England. The outcome was a 1\u20131 draw.\n<br>\nLeading their World Cup qualifying group, Montenegro hosted Ukraine on 7 June 2013. They suffered their first defeat in the group, losing 4\u20130. The match also saw Montenegro finish the match with nine men after [[Vladimir Volkov]] and [[Savo Pavi\u0107evi\u0107]] were sent off. Their last four matches yielded just a single point; a 1\u20131 draw in Poland. Their 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign finished with a 5\u20132 home defeat to Moldova, and they finished third behind England and Ukraine.\n\n===Ups and downs===\nOn 23 February 2014 in [[Nice]], Montenegro were drawn for qualification in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group G|Group G]] alongside [[Russia national football team|Russia]], [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], [[Austria national football team|Austria]], Moldova and [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]]. Though they opened their campaign with a 2\u20130 win over Moldova, they failed to qualify with a 0\u20130 tie against Liechtenstein, a 1\u20130 loss to Austria and a 1\u20131 tie at home to Sweden.<br>\nOn 27 March 2015, Montenegro's home match against Russia was abandoned after 67 minutes due to crowd violence, after the Russian [[left-back]] [[Dmitri Kombarov]] was hit by a projectile. The score was 0\u20130 and Russia had missed a penalty moments before the match was abandoned. The Russian goalkeeper [[Igor Akinfeev]] was hit by a flare, causing a second 33-minute delay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-arrests-fans-for-football-match-bowl|title=Montenegro Arrests Fans for Football Violence|website=balkaninsight.com|publisher=Balkan Insight|date=31 March 2015|accessdate=18 September 2016}}</ref> The abandoned match was ruled a 3\u20130 win in Russia's favour.<br>\nMontenegro finished fourth at the end of the campaign and placed 95th on the FIFA ranking list.<br>\nMontenegro participated in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group E|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] and were placed with Poland, [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]], [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] and [[Romania national football team|Romania]]. Poland and Romania had been participants in the [[UEFA Euro 2016]], but Montenegro began by drawing 1\u20131 away to Romania, beating Kazakhstan 5\u20130 at home and defeating Denmark 1\u20130. However, they then lost 3\u20132 away to Armenia despite leading 2\u20130, and were defeated 2\u20131 at home by Poland. Montenegro then rebounded, beating Armenia 4\u20131 and Kazakhstan 3\u20130. They later eliminated Romania with a 1\u20130 victory, but losses to the Danes and Poles ended Montenegro's chance of qualifying.<br>\nHaving failed to reach the World Cup, Montenegro had a dismal performance in the [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League C]]. The team was grouped with [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]]. Montenegro only managed two victories, all against Lithuania, and suffered two losses to Serbia, one defeat to Romania at home and an away draw to the Romanian side as well. This effectively denied Montenegro a chance to qualify to the [[UEFA Euro 2020]] playoff.\n\n===Worst campaign===\nThe [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying Group A|EURO 2020 qualifiers]] for Montenegro have been the worst in the team's short history. After unsuccessful [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League C|Nations League]] campaign, the team started off with a 1\u20131 away draw to Bulgaria, following a controversial penalty for the hosts. It was followed with a 1\u20135 loss at home to England despite having taken an early lead. <br>\nOn the day of the match with [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], Serbian coach [[Ljubi\u0161a Tumbakovi\u0107]] and two players originated from Serbia, due to political reasons, abandoned the national team, betraying the squad in unprecedented condition before the two crucial matches for qualifiers. Montenegro managed to avoid defeat against Kosovo (1-1), however they lost to Czech Republic 0\u20133. The same result occurred in the rematch, one month later. With no chances to qualify directly, Montenegro failed to win the match against last placed Bulgaria (0-0), and lost to Kosovo (0-2).<br>\nAt the end of their worst campaign, Montenegro suffered the biggest defeat in history. Od 14th November 2019, they were defeated against England in [[London]] 7-0.<br>\nExcept the fact that they finished qualifiers without single victory, Montenegro scored only three goals on eight matches, and conceded 22. Also, throughout the entire qualifying campaign the team had troubles with injuries of the key players, especially [[Stevan Joveti\u0107]] and [[Stefan Savi\u0107]].\n\n==FIFA rankings==\n{{Main|Montenegro national football team records and statistics}}\nMontenegro national football team is present on [[FIFA rankings]] since June 2007. Until now, best ranking of Montenegro was 16th place in the world (June 2011).<br />\nBelow is a list of Montenegro position on FIFA ranking-list by every six months, with number of points.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\n|-\n!

The team's nickname is \"The Brave Falcons\" ({{lang-cnr|Hrabri Sokoli|italics=yes}}).\n\n===Stadium===\n{{Main|Podgorica City Stadium}}\nMontenegro play home matches at the [[Podgorica City Stadium]] ({{lang-cnr|Stadion pod Goricom|italics=yes}}). The stadium's capacity is 15,230, but international matches reduce this to between 10,700 and 13,000.\n\n===Camp FSCG===\n{{main|Camp FSCG}}\nThe Football Association of Montenegro owns Camp FSCG, a Montenegrin training ground. Built in 2007, the centre has a total area of 54,000 square metres.<ref>http://www.podgorica.me/sport</ref> It is located on ''\u0106emovsko polje'', a plain located in the outskirts of Podgorica outskirts between the settlements of [[Stari Aerodrom]] and [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]]. It consists of six pitches with stands and floodlights,<ref>http://fscg.me/istorija-savez/investicije</ref> and ''House of Football'' \u2013 the seat of the Football Association of Montenegro.<ref>http://cdm.me/sport/fudbal/video-zavirite-u-novu-kucu-fudbala/</ref>\n\nThe camp currently represents an important asset for the whole Montenegrin football system. The grounds are home to all Montenegrin national teams (men and women) and numerous local teams from Podgorica. CAMP FSCG meets the criteria for [[Montenegrin First League]] games and [[UEFA]] competitions for young players.\n\n===Kit===\nThe team kit is produced by the Italian company [[Legea]]. It is all-red with gold details to reflect the colours of the [[Flag of Montenegro|Montenegrin national flag]]. Before that, the kit providers were ''daCapo''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FF0000\"| <span style=\"color:white\">Manufacturer</span>\n!style=\"background:#FF0000\"| <span style=\"color:white\">Period</span>\n|-\n|align=\"Left\"| {{flagicon|SRB}} ''daCapo'' ||2007\u20132008\n|-\n|align=\"Left\"| {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Legea]] ||2008\u2013present\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FF0000\" colspan=2|\n|}\n\n===Supporters===\nAt competitive matches, the Montenegrin home ground [[Podgorica City Stadium]] is often filled to capacity. The stadium is regarded as too small to meet the needs of the national team. Demand for the World Cup qualifier against Italy in 2009 was 30,000 tickets; 40,000 for the Euro 2012 qualifying match against England in 2011.\n\nMontenegro's loudest and most loyal supporters are named ''Ultra Crna Gora'' (\u0423\u043b\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430; ''Ultra Montenegro''). As an [[ultras]] group, their support consists of standing up and singing for 90 minutes both home and away. They occupy the north and south stands of [[Podgorica City Stadium]]. Choreography is usually performed at the beginning of games. ''Ultra Crna Gora'' consists of many subgroups, mostly named after Podgorica's neighborhoods and [[List of cities in Montenegro|Montenegrin towns]] in other parts of the country.\n\n==Players==\nIn [[FIFA|international football]], players can normally only play for one national team once they play in all or part of any match recognised as a full international by [[FIFA]]. However, an exception is made in cases where one or more newly independent states are created out of a former state. Based on current FIFA rules, a player will be eligible to play for Montenegro, even if he had previously represented Serbia and Montenegro or any other country, if at least one of the following statements applies:<ref>https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/status%5ftransfer%5fen%5f25.pdf</ref>\n\n*The player was born in Montenegro;\n*At least one of their parents and/or at least one of their grandparents was born in Montenegro;\n*The player has lived in Montenegro continuously for any five-year period.\n\nDue to mixed ancestries, it is likely that a high percentage of the players eligible to play for Montenegro will also remain eligible to play for Serbia, and vice versa. However, once they have played for either Serbia or Montenegro in any competitive fixture, they are no longer eligible to play for any other nation.\n\n===Current squad===\nThe following players were called up for [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying|Euro 2020 qualifying]] game against [[England national football team|England]] on 14 November and friendly match against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] on 19 November 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fscg.me/vijesti/7239/spisak-sokola-za-meceve-sa-engleskom-i-bjelorusijom|title=''SPISAK \u201eSOKOLA\u201c ZA ME\u010cEVE SA ENGLESKOM I

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. .... Banneker's scientific research led him to write one of the first series of almanacs printed in the United States.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321194817/https://www.nps.gov/places/sw-9-intermediate-boundary-stone-of-the-district-of-columbia.htm/index.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, historical research has shown that none of these legends can be correct.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]] in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. .... Banneker's scientific research led him to write one of the first series of almanacs printed in the United States.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321194817/https://www.nps.gov/places/sw-9-intermediate-boundary-stone-of-the-district-of-columbia.htm/index.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, historical research has shown that none of these legends can be correct.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]] in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.
