First, when the NCAA placed severe restrictions on the fielding of Division I teams by Division II institutions in 2011, it grandfathered in all then-current D-I teams at D-II schools. Apart from this, Division II members are allowed to compete for Division I championships in sports in which a Division II national championship is not contested.\n\nIn some sports, the NCAA only sponsors championships open to all member schools regardless of division, with examples including beach volleyball, fencing, rifle, and water polo. In men's and women's ice hockey and men's volleyball, the NCAA holds Division III championships, but does not hold a separate D-II championship. The NCAA officially classifies all championship events that are open to schools from more than one division as \"National Collegiate\", except in men's ice hockey, in which the top-level championship is styled as a Division I championship (presumably due to the past existence of a Division II championship in that sport). Division II members are allowed to compete for National Collegiate championships as well as the Division I men's ice hockey championship; in all such sports, they are allowed to operate under the same rules and scholarship restrictions that apply to full Division I members in that sport.\n\nThe Northeast-10 sponsors men's ice hockey for its members who choose to remain in D-II, including a postseason tournament. The conference formerly sponsored a women's ice hockey postseason tournament for those teams remaining in D-II but competing as independents during the regular season, but that tournament has been superseded by the [[New England Women's Hockey Alliance]] (NEWHA), which began play in 2017 as a scheduling agreement between all of the existing women's National Collegiate independents (including full D-I member Sacred Heart), organized as a full conference in 2018, and received official NCAA recognition in 2019. Because the NE-10 is the sole Division II hockey league, its postseason champion cannot compete for the NCAA national hockey championship. The Post University men's team competes as D-II and has a scheduling alliance with the NE-10 schools, while its women's team is a member of the NEWHA.\n\n*Future conference affiliations indicated in this list will take effect on July 1 of the stated year. In the case of spring sports, the first year of competition will take place in the calendar year after the conference move becomes official.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! School\n!

First, when the NCAA placed severe restrictions on the fielding of Division I teams by Division II institutions in 2011, it grandfathered in all then-current D-I teams at D-II schools. Apart from this, Division II members are allowed to compete for Division I championships in sports in which a Division II national championship is not contested.\n\nIn some sports, the NCAA only sponsors championships open to all member schools regardless of division, with examples including beach volleyball, fencing, rifle, and water polo. In men's and women's ice hockey and men's volleyball, the NCAA holds Division III championships, but does not hold a separate D-II championship. The NCAA officially classifies all championship events that are open to schools from more than one division as \"National Collegiate\", except in men's ice hockey, in which the top-level championship is styled as a Division I championship (presumably due to the past existence of a Division II championship in that sport). Division II members are allowed to compete for National Collegiate championships as well as the Division I men's ice hockey championship; in all such sports, they are allowed to operate under the same rules and scholarship restrictions that apply to full Division I members in that sport.\n\nThe Northeast-10 sponsors men's ice hockey for its members who choose to remain in D-II, including a postseason tournament. The conference formerly sponsored a women's ice hockey postseason tournament for those teams remaining in D-II but competing as independents during the regular season, but that tournament has been superseded by the [[New England Women's Hockey Alliance]] (NEWHA), which began play in 2017 as a scheduling agreement between all of the existing women's National Collegiate independents (including full D-I member Sacred Heart), organized as a full conference in 2018, and received official NCAA recognition in 2019. Because the NE-10 is the sole Division II hockey league, its postseason champion cannot compete for the NCAA national hockey championship. The Post University men's team competes as D-II and has a scheduling alliance with the NE-10 schools, while its women's team is a member of the NEWHA.\n\n*Future conference affiliations indicated in this list will take effect on July 1 of the stated year. In the case of spring sports, the first year of competition will take place in the calendar year after the conference move becomes official.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! School\n!

The following year he obtained a post at the ''Darzhavna pechatnitsa'', the official government publisher in [[Sofia]]. In 1932, he joined the BWP proper, later serving as secretary of its Second Borough Committee and as a member of its Sofia County Committee. Although the BWP was banned along with all other political parties after the uprising of [[1934 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|19 May 1934]], it continued fielding a handful of non-party National Assembly Deputies and Zhivkov retained his posts at its Sofia structure.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Zhivkov participated in Bulgaria's resistance movement against the country's alignment with [[Nazi Germany]] and was sympathetic to the country's 50,000 Jews.<ref>Bar-Zohar, Michael, ''Beyond Hitler's Grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews''. Adams Media Corp. 1998, p.199</ref> In 1943, he was involved in organising the [[Chavdar (resistance brigade)|Chavdar]] partisan detachment in and around his place of birth, becoming deputy commander of the Sofia operations area in the summer of 1944. Under his rule, many fellow former combatants with Chavdar were to rise to positions of prominence in Bulgarian affairs. He is said to have coordinated partisan movements with those of pro-Soviet army units during the [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|9 September 1944 uprising]].\n\n== Rise to power ==\n[[File:Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov.jpg|thumb|Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov in a Fatherland Front congress in 1946.]]\nAfter 9 September 1944, Zhivkov became head of the [[Sofia]] police force, restyled as the ''Narodna Militsiya'' (People's Militia). He was elected to the BCP [[Central Committee]] as a candidate member in 1945 and a full member in 1948. In the run-up to the 1949 treason trial against [[Traicho Kostov]], Zhivkov criticised the Party and judicial authorities for what he claimed was their leniency with regard to Kostov. This placed him in the [[Stalinist]] [[hardline]] wing of the Party. In 1950, Zhivkov became a candidate member of the BCP [[Politburo]], then led by [[Vulko Chervenkov]], leading to a full membership in 1951. In the years which followed, he was involved in countering countryside resistance to forced [[collective farming|farm collectivisation]] in northwestern Bulgaria.\n\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, an emphasis on shared leadership emerged. The hardline Stalinist Chervenkov gave up his post as General Secretary of the BCP in 1954. Zhivkov took his place, but Chervenkov retained most of his powers as [[prime minister]]. Bulgarian opinion at the time interpreted this as a self-preservation move by Chervenkov, since Zhivkov was a less well known figure in the party. After [[Nikita Khrushchev]] delivered his famous secret speech against Stalin at the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] 20th Congress, a BCP Central Committee plenary meeting was convened in April 1956 to agree to adopt a new Krushchevite line. At that ''plenum'', Zhivkov criticized Chervenkov as a disciple of Stalin, had him demoted from prime minister to a cabinet post, and promoted former [[Committee for State Security]] (CSS) head [[Anton Yugov]] to the post of prime minister. It was at this point that he became the ''de facto'' leader of Bulgaria. Subsequently, Zhivkov was associated with the \"April Line,\" which had [[anti-Stalinist]] credentials. At the BCP 8th Congress in late 1962, Zhivkov accused Yugov of anti-Party activity, expelled him from the BCP and had him placed under [[house arrest]].\n\nWith the increasingly strengthening positions of Zhivkov as the country's and Communist party's leader, former [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] leaders and active military took a critical stance on the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] policies of the communist leadership. In the events described as the \"[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|April Conspiracy]]\" of 1965 or the \"Plot of Gorunia,\" general [[Ivan Todorov-Gorunia]], general [[Tzviatko Anev]] (''\u0426\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043a\u043e \u0410\u043d\u0435\u0432'') and [[Tzolo \u041arastev]] (''\u0426\u043e\u043b\u043e \u041a\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0432'') organized a group of high-ranking military officers planning to overthrow the regime. Their plan was to establish a pro-Chinese leadership in the country. The coup was exposed and between 28 March and 12 April 1965 and most of the plotters were arrested.\n\nAs prime minister, Zhivkov then held both of Bulgaria's leading political and government posts; for nearly all of Bulgaria's existence as an independent nation, the prime minister has been reckoned as the country's leading political figure. Though the post of head of state was traditionally reserved for the leader of the surviving pro-Communist faction of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]], the \"[[Zhivkov Constitution]]\" adopted by referendum in July 1971 promoted him to chairman of the new State Council. The post, equivalent to that of president, confirmed his position as the country's top leader. Zhivkov remained faithful to Moscow during his 35 years in power, but adopted a more liberal stance than his predecessor by allowing some market reforms (such as allowing surplus agricultural goods to be sold for profit) and ending persecution of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\n== Policies ==\n=== Economic ===\nIn the mid-1950s, Soviet-style centralized planning produced economic indicators showing that Bulgarians were returning to their prewar lifestyle in some respects: real wages increased 75%, consumption of meat, fruit, and vegetables increased markedly, medical facilities and doctors became available to more of the population, and in 1957 collective farm workers benefited from the first agricultural pension and welfare system in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0062) Domestic Policy and Its Results], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1959 the Communist Party borrowed from the Chinese [[Great Leap Forward]] to symbolize a sudden burst of economic activity to be injected into the Third Five-Year Plan (1958\u20131962), whose original scope was quite conservative. According to the revised plan, industrial production would double and agricultural production would triple by 1962; a new agricultural collectivization and consolidation drive would achieve great economies of scale in that branch; investment in light industry would double, and foreign trade would expand.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Following the Chinese model, all of Bulgarian society was to be propagandized and mobilized to meet the planning goals.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Two purposes of the grandiose revised plan were to keep Bulgaria in step with the Soviet bloc, all of whose members were embarking on plans for accelerated growth, and to quell internal party conflicts. Amalgamation of collective farms cut their number by 70 percent, after which average farm acreage was second only to the Soviet Union among countries in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Plan\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The First Five-Year Plans], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov, whose \"theses\" had defined the goals of the plan, purged Politburo members and party rivals [[Boris Taskov]] (in 1959) and [[Anton Yugov]] (in 1962), citing their criticism of his policy as economically obstructionist. Already by 1960, however, Zhivkov had been forced to redefine the impossible goals of his theses.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Lack of skilled labor and materials made completion of projects at the prescribed pace impossible. Harvests were disastrously poor in the early 1960s; peasant unrest forced the government to raise food prices; and the urban dissatisfaction that resulted from higher prices compounded a crisis that broke in the summer of 1962. Blame fell on Zhivkov's experiments with decentralized planning, which was totally abandoned by 1963.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Despite this, by 1960 the value produced by heavy industry matched that of light industry, and food processing for export grew rapidly.<ref name=\"Plan\"/> Throughout the second phase, budget expenditures consisted primarily of reinvestment in sectors given initial priority. The completion of collectivization in 1958 had shifted 678,000 peasants, about 20 percent of the active labor force, into industrial jobs.<ref name=\"Plan\"/>\n\n[[File:BlockOs-68-Gl 3.JPG|thumb|right|Large-scale industrialization caused many laborers to move from rural to urban areas, which required the construction of numerous pre-fabricated apartment buildings such as this one in Sofia]]\n\nBy the early 1960s, however, changes to the system were obviously needed to achieve sustained growth in all branches of production, including agriculture.<ref name=\"Experimentation\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The Era of Experimentation and Reform], Library of Congress</ref> Specific incentives to reform were shortages of labor and energy and the growing importance of foreign trade in the \"thaw\" years of the mid-1960s. Consequently, in 1962 the Fourth Five-Year Plan began an era of economic reform that brought a series of new approaches to the old goal of [[intensive growth]].<ref name=\"Experimentation\"/> In industry the \"New System of Management\" was introduced in 1964 and lasted until 1968. This approach intended to streamline economic units and make enterprise managers more responsible for performance. In June 1964, about fifty industrial enterprises, mostly producers of [[textiles]] and other consumer goods, were placed under the new system. [[Wage]]s, bonuses, and investment funds were tied to enterprise profits, up to 70% of which could be retained.<ref name=\"Decentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0113) Industrial decentralization], Library of Congress</ref> Outside investment funds were to come primarily from [[bank credit]] rather than the [[state budget]]. In 1965 state subsidies still accounted for 63% of enterprise investment funds, however, while 30% came from retained enterprise earnings and only 7% from bank credits.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1970 budget subsidies accounted for only 27% of investment funds, while bank credits jumped to 39%, and retained enterprise earnings reached 34%.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> The pilot enterprises did very well, earning profits that were double the norm.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1967 two-thirds of industrial production came from firms under the new system, which by that time had embraced areas outside consumer production.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/>\n\n[[File:Cocacola cyrilic.JPG|thumb|left|upright|130px|Zhivkov's reforms resulted in some expansion of trade with the West, as evidenced by licensed [[Coca-Cola]] production since the 1960s with a [[Cyrillic]] logo]]\n\nBefore the end of the 1960s, however, Bulgarian economic planning moved back toward the conventional CPE approach. Many Western analysts attributed the Bulgarian retreat from the reforms of the 1960s to tension caused by the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968. International events may well have played a role, but the timing of the retreat and the invasion suggest another component: dissatisfaction among the Party elite with the results and ideological implications of the reform.<ref name=\"Recentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0114) Industrial Recentralization]</ref> For example, in July 1968, one month before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria's unorthodox, three-tiered pricing system was eliminated. The party leadership had never accepted the concept of free and flexible pricing for some products, which was an important Bulgarian departure from centralized planning in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> Resistance to reform was further encouraged by a series of cases in which major enterprise directors used newly decentralized financial resources to line their own pockets.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> However, some of the recentralization measures, such as the creation of an agricultural-industrial complex, also received domestic criticism.<ref name=\"Units\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0115) Larger Economic Units], Library of Congress</ref> Both Western and domestic customers remained dissatisfied with the quality of many Bulgarian manufactures. Party meetings and the press criticized monopolistic abuses resulting from irrational decisions at the top and poor implementation of rational policies at the enterprise level.<ref name=\"Units\"/>\n\nAfter a relative stagnation in the 1970s, the New Economic Model (NEM), instituted in 1981 as the latest economic reform program, seemingly improved the supply of consumer goods and generally upgraded the economy.<ref name=\"1980s\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) Bulgaria in the 1980s], Library of Congress</ref> In an effort to remedy the [[shortage economy|chronic distribution problems]] of the central economy, higher economic institutions became financially accountable for damage inflicted by their decisions on subordinate levels.<ref name=\"NEM\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0116) The New Economic Model], Library of Congress</ref> Complexes or associations were given explicit freedom to sign their own contracts with suppliers and customers at home and abroad.<ref name=\"NEM\"/> However, NEM was unable to drastically improve the quality or quantity of Bulgarian goods and produce. In 1983 Zhivkov harshly criticized all of Bulgarian industry and agriculture in a major speech, but the reforms generated by his speech did nothing to improve the situation.<ref name=\"1980s\"/> A large percentage of high-quality domestic goods were shipped abroad in the early 1980s to shrink Bulgaria's hard-currency debt, and the purchase of Western technology was sacrificed for the same reason, crippling technical advancement and disillusioning consumers.

This led to a Bulgarian version of the Soviet [[perestroika]] program. After a round of failed experimental measures, in January 1989 the Party issued Decree Number 56. This decree established \"firms\" as the primary unit of economic management.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> In a fundamental departure from the socialist prohibition of private citizens hiring labor, as many as ten people could now be hired permanently, and an unlimited number could be hired on temporary contracts.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> This last round of reforms by the Zhivkov regime confused rather than improved economic performance. However, statistics on growth for 1986-88 still indicated a 5.5% annual rate, up from the 3.7% rate achieved during the previous five-year plan.<ref name=\"Last round\"/>\n\n=== Social ===\n[[File:Gini since WWII.svg|right|thumb|230px|Zhivkov's social policies resulted in Bulgaria having [[Gini coefficient]] of 18 in the 1970s, ranking among the countries with the lowest levels of [[income inequality]] in the world]]\n\nEven before Zhivkov, Bulgaria made significant progress in increasing life expectancy and decreasing infant mortality rates. Consistent social policies led to an increase in life expectancy to 68.1 years for men and 74.4 years for women.<ref name=\"Health\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0099) Health], Library of Congress</ref> In 1939 the mortality rate for children under one year had been 138.9 per 1,000; by 1986 it was 18.2 per 1,000, and in 1990 it was 14 per 1,000, the lowest rate in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Health\"/> The proportion of long-lived people in Bulgaria was quite large; a 1988 study cited a figure of 52 centenarians per 1 million inhabitants. One of the first mass HIV testing programs was initiated under Zhivkov, and as of October 1989, some 2.5 million people in Bulgaria, including about 66,000 foreigners, had been tested for HIV, and 81 Bulgarians were diagnosed as HIV positive.<ref name=\"Health\"/> Increases in real incomes in agriculture rose by 6.7 percent per year during the 1960s. During this same period, industrial wages increased by 4.9 percent annually.<ref name=\"Standards\"/> Availability of consumer durables significantly improved in the 1970s. According to official statistics, between 1965 and 1988 the number of televisions per 100 households increased from 8 to 100; radios increased from 59 to 95; refrigerators from 5 to 96; washing machines from 23 to 96; and automobiles from 2 to 40. Available automobiles were primarily Soviet Fiats, some of which were manufactured in Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Standards\"/>\n\nIn the postwar era, and especially under Zhivkov, housing in Bulgaria improved significantly as more and better-quality homes were built.<ref name=\"Housing\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0100) Housing], Library of Congress</ref> However, many of them were cramped - the average home in Bulgaria had three rooms and an area of {{convert|65|m2}}.<ref name=\"Housing\"/> Housing remained one of the most serious shortcomings in the Bulgarian standard of living throughout Zhivkov's rule. Residential construction targets in the Five-Year Plans were regularly underfulfilled. Consequently, families often waited several years for apartments; in Sofia, where overcrowding was at its worst, the wait was as long as ten years.<ref name=\"Standards\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0144) Standards of living], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nThe educational system, despite the addition of ideological subjects, remained relatively unchanged after the beginning of the Communist era. In 1979 Zhivkov introduced a sweeping educational reform, claiming that [[Marxism|Marxist]] teachings on educating youth were still not being applied completely.<ref name=\"Education\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0101) Education], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov therefore created Unified Secondary Polytechnical Schools (''Edinni sredni politekhnicheski uchilishta'', ESPU), in which all students would receive the same general education. The system united previously separate specialized middle schools in a single, twelve-grade program heavily emphasizing technical subjects. In 1981 a national program introduced [[computer]]s to most of the ESPUs.<ref name=\"Education\"/>\n\n=== Foreign ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K0615-0001-141, Berlin, VIII.

Zhivkov was awarded the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] in 1977.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=2164 Biography] at the website on Heroes of the Soviet Union and Russia</ref> Yet, though Bulgarian ''\u00e9migr\u00e9'' dissident [[Georgi Markov]] wrote that \"[Zhivkov] served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet leaders themselves did,\" in many ways he can be said to have exploited the USSR for political purposes, with Bulgaria serving a buffer between the USSR and NATO. Thus, he claims in his memoirs that the USSR had become \"a raw material appendage to Bulgaria,\" something obliquely confirmed by Gorbachev when he wrote in his memoirs that \"Bulgaria was a country which had lived beyond its means for a long time.\" An example of how the \"raw material appendage\" was exploited was the trade in Soviet [[crude oil]]. This would be shipped to Bulgaria's modern [[Oil refinery|refinery]] in [[Burgas]] at subsidized prices, processed, and resold on world markets at a huge premium.\n\nIn 1963 and 1973, the Zhivkov regime made requests \u2014 it is unclear how far these were in earnest \u2014 that\nBulgaria be incorporated into the USSR, both times because the Bulgarian government, having engaged in\nbitter polemics with [[Yugoslavia]] over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], feared a Soviet\u2013Yugoslav reconciliation at its own expense. In 1963, following the decision of [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow]] to recognize the autonomy of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]], the Bulgarian leaders openly declared that there was no \"historic Macedonian nation.\" In the face of Moscow's post-1953 efforts to reach out to Belgrade and Athens, Zhivkov seems to have calculated that a policy of unswerving loyalty to the Kremlin would ensure that it remained more valuable for the USSR than non-aligned Yugoslavia or NATO-affiliated Greece.<ref>Bal\u00e1zs Szalontai, Political and Economic Relations between Communist States. In: Stephen Anthony Smith (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook in the History of Communism'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 314.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bulgaria gave official military support to many national liberation causes, most notably in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, ([[North Vietnam]]), [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], [[People's Republic of Angola|Angola]], Afghanistan, the [[Horn of Africa]], and the [[Middle East]]. In 1984 the 9,000 Bulgarian advisers stationed in Libya for military and nonmilitary aid put that country in first place among Bulgaria's [[Third World]] clients. Through its Kintex arms export enterprise, Bulgaria also engaged in covert military support activities, many of which were subsequently disclosed. In the 1970s, diplomatic crises with [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] were triggered by Bulgarian involvement in coup plots.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/>\n\nUnder Zhivkov Bulgaria's policy toward [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States]] was determined largely by the position of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Western Europe\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0193) Western Europe and the US], Library of Congress</ref> Events such as the invasions of Czechoslovakia and [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] automatically distanced Bulgaria from the West; then, in the early 1980s Soviet efforts to split NATO by cultivating Western Europe brought Bulgaria closer to [[France]] and [[West Germany]] - a position that continued through the 1980s. Even back in the 1970s, Zhivkov actively pursued better relations with the West, overcoming conservative opposition and the tentative, tourism-based approach to the West taken as early as the 1960s.<ref name=\"Affairs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0066) Foreign Affairs in the 1960s-70s], Library of Congress</ref> Emulating Soviet d\u00e9tente policy of the 1970s, Bulgaria gained Western technology, expanded cultural contacts, and attracted Western investments with the most liberal foreign investment policy in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> As in 1956 and 1968, however, Soviet actions altered Bulgaria's position. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in late 1979, which Bulgaria supported vigorously, renewed tension between Bulgaria and the West. Alleged Bulgarian implication in the attempted assassination of Pope [[John Paul II]] in 1981 exacerbated the problem and kept relations cool through the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> A 1988 application for membership in the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] was refused because of the Turkish assimilation program, after widespread expectations of success.<ref name=\"Western Europe\"/>\n\nBulgarian relations with Greece, a traditional enemy, were stable throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in spite of major government changes in both countries. Zhivkov made this stability a model for the overall Balkan cooperation that was a centerpiece of his foreign policy in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Greece\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0190) Greece]</ref> In 1986 the two countries signed a declaration of good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation that was based on mutual enmity toward Turkey and toward Yugoslav demands for recognition of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] minorities in Bulgaria and Greece. An important motivation for friendship with Greece was to exploit [[NATO]]'s Greek-Turkish split, which was based on the claims of the two countries in [[Cyprus]]. In early 1989, Bulgaria signed a ten-year bilateral economic agreement with Greece.<ref name=\"Greece\"/>\n\n=== Cultural ===\n\nUntil the late 1980s, Zhivkov successfully prevented unrest in the Bulgarian intellectual community.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0181) Zhivkov and the Intelligentsia], Library of Congress</ref> Membership in the writers' union brought enormous privilege and social stature, and that drew many dissident writers such as Georgi Dzhagarov and Lyubomir Levchev into the circle of the officially approved intelligentsia. On the other hand, entry required intellectual compromise, and refusal to compromise led to dismissal from the union and loss of all privileges. The punishment of dissident writers sometimes went far beyond loss of privileges. In 1978 \u00e9migr\u00e9 writer [[Georgi Markov]] was murdered in London for his anticommunist broadcasts for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and [[Blaga Dimitrova]] was harshly denounced for her critical portrayal of party officials in her 1982 novel ''Litse''.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/>\n\nZhivkov also softened organized opposition by restoring symbols of the Bulgarian cultural past that had been cast aside in the postwar campaign to consolidate Soviet-style party control. Beginning in 1967, he appealed loudly to the people to remember \"our motherland Bulgaria\".<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> In the late 1970s, Zhivkov mended relations with the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> Zhivkov's extensive campaign of cultural restoration provided at least some common ground between him and the Bulgarian intelligentsia. In 1980 Zhivkov had improved his domestic position by appointing his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] as chair of the commission on science, culture, and art.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0068) The Political Atmosphere in the 1970s], Library of Congress</ref> In this powerful position, Zhivkova became extremely popular by promoting Bulgaria's separate national cultural heritage. She spent large sums of money in a highly visible campaign to support scholars, collect Bulgarian art, and sponsor cultural institutions. Among her policies was closer cultural contact with the West; her most visible project was the spectacular national celebration of [[1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State|Bulgaria's 1,300th anniversary]] in 1981. When Zhivkova died in 1981, relations with the West had already been chilled by the Afghanistan issue, but her brief administration of Bulgaria's official cultural life was a successful phase of her father's appeal to Bulgarian national tradition to bind the country together.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\"/>\n\nSports also prospered during Zhivkov's rule. From 1956 to 1988, Bulgaria won an unprecedented 153 Olympic medals and numerous European and world competitions in sports as diverse as [[volleyball]], [[rhythmic gymnastics]] and [[wrestling]].\n\n== Dissent and human rights violations ==\n\nDissent was punished under Zhivkov's rule. The CSS was a feared tool of control, and overt opposition largely stayed underground until the late 1980s. In 1978, the Bulgarian dissident [[Georgi Markov]] was assassinated in London by an agent who stabbed him with an umbrella tip which implanted a very small [[ricin]] ball. According to former [[KGB]] [[general]] [[Oleg Kalugin]], this was requested by Zhivkov and either performed by the [[KGB]] or it assisted the CSS; the actual assassin is reputed to have been [[Francesco Gullino]], working for the CSS. In Zhivkov's time, Bulgarians found it extremely difficult to travel abroad.\n\nZhivkov was particularly intolerant of dissent within the Party.  When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced his reform program, Zhivkov made a show of copying it, believing that Gorbachev wasn't really serious about ''[[glasnost]]'' or ''[[perestroika]].''<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>  However, he showed his true colors when he expelled several members of a human-rights watch group from the Party. Soon afterward, when several intellectuals announced the formation of the \"Club for the Support of Perestroika and Glasnost,\" he arrested the leaders and threw them out of the Party.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008|last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |ISBN=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Unreferenced section : == Nepotism and insistence on ''predanost'' ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nZhivkov married Mara Maleeva (1911\u20131971) in 1938. They had two children, both would be promoted in the BCP hierarchy, daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] and son Vladimir Zhivkov. Lyudmila became a Politburo member and earned the ire of the BCP and Bulgaria's benefactors in [[Moscow]] with her unorthodox artistic ideas and practice of Eastern religions. She died abruptly at the age of 38 in 1981. Her health was severely compromised by stress, failed marriages, and unusual dietary/lifestyle practices, although rumours of assassination or suicide abounded. With Lyudmila's death, her friends and supporters were quickly removed from all positions of power. Son-in-law [[Ivan Slavkov]] was made chairman of Bulgaria's state television company and later became president of the [[Bulgarian Olympic Committee]].\n\nApart from promoting his family, Zhivkov instituted a complex system of privileges which extended to former Resistance figures, Party members and ''prominenti'' of the sciences, arts and manufacture. In the early 1960s, he was instrumental in constructing a large set of housing, financial, educational, electoral and other benefits to be granted to a large category of people called \"Active Fighters against Capitalism and Fascism\" who had ostensibly been members of the rather modest Bulgarian Wartime resistance and which was expanded to absurd proportions. Without necessarily receiving great remuneration (pay differentials under Zhivkov were within the 5:1 range, with the overwhelming majority of salaries being within the 3:1 range), Party members and CSS informers received very significant perquisites which involved access to accommodation, luxury imported goods, hard currency, the ability to travel abroad, superior medical and dental treatment and unhindered entry to higher education for their children. The scope of these privileges broadened as they rose in the Party hierarchy. Eminent artists, scientists and \"Heroes of Socialist Labour\" (mostly collective farmers and shop-floor workers) received similar privileges. Established in the early years of Zhivkov's terms in power, [[Corecom]] was a retail chain in which foreigners could shop with hard currency, but its main customers were privileged Bulgarians close to the Zhivkov regime.\n\nIn Zhivkov's Bulgaria, money had lost many of its traditional properties, being replaced by sets of complex personal and family material and career considerations which have been described as \"feudal\". This hampered the prosecution in post-Zhivkov fraud and corruption trials, since no venality could be proved against those charged: they had merely received goods in kind and services which moreover had been their \"legal due\".\n\nZhivkov reserved a special attention for his birthplace of [[Pravets]]. In the 1960s this small village was declared \"an Urban Community,\" becoming a town a decade later. In 1982 Bulgaria's first Apple clone personal computer was named the ''Pravets''. The grateful citizens of Pravets responded by erecting a heroic statue to Zhivkov which he duly had taken down, ostensibly to prevent a personal cult growing around him. It was re-erected after his death.\n\nThroughout his tenure of power, Zhivkov surrounded himself with those who exhibited ''predanost'' (loyalty, devotion, the desire to proffer all). In his reminiscences, Vladimir Kostov, a Bulgarian secret agent who defected to [[France]] in 1978, recalls how the powerful minister of internal affairs would suffer nervous episodes before meeting Zhivkov lest his ''predanost'' should fail to come across sufficiently expressively..-->\n\n== Image ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThroughout his tenure, Zhivkov's [[dialect]] and poor manners made him the butt of many acerbic jibes and jokes in Bulgaria's urbane circles. While the feared CSS secret police was commonly said to persecute those who told political jokes, Zhivkov himself was said to have found them amusing and \"collected\" an archive of them. His popular nickname was \"bai Tosho\" (approximately \"Ol' Uncle Tosho\") or occasionally (and later) \"Tato\" (a dialectal word for [[Father|\"Dad\" or \"Pop\"]]). Markov tells a story of how Zhivkov reproached a popular newspaper cartoonist for modifying his signature to resemble a pig's tail, yet did not persecute him. A handful of satirist dissidents such as [[Radoy Ralin]] enjoyed some prominence, although Ralin was not favored by the authorities due to his sharp satire.\n\nZhivkov survived the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Khrushchev's fall in October 1964, an attempted Stalinist-Maoist ''[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|coup d\u2019\u00e9tat]]'' in 1965, his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]]'s death in 1981, [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's death]] in 1982, and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s post-1985 reforms.\n\n== Fall ==\n\nIn December 1984, Todor Zhivkov began a campaign of forcible assimilation of Bulgaria's Turkish minority, most notably forcing all Turks to take Bulgarian names. By 1989, resistance to this policy led to riots, which resulted in multiple deaths. In May 1989, Zhivkov ordered an expulsion of Turks (and Muslims) to Turkey across the then [[Iron Curtain]] boundary between these two countries. This led to the largest [[ethnic cleansing]] in Europe during the [[Cold War]], in which over 360,000 Turks (and Muslims) were targeted within three months.<ref>See:'2. \u041e\u0431\u044f\u0432\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434 360 000 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 1989 \u0433. \u0437\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u0438\u0437\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c.'

Bulgaria was the target of near-unanimous condemnation from the international community; even the Soviets protested. Gorbachev already did not think much of Zhivkov; he had lumped Zhivkov in with a group of inflexible hardliners that included [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia's]] [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania's]] [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]].  However, after the Turkish episode, he was determined to see Zhivkov gone.  The Turkish affair also alarmed several high-ranking Bulgarian officials as well, including [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] [[Georgi Atanasov (politician)|Georgi Atanasov]], Foreign Minister [[Petar Mladenov]] and Finance Minister [[Andrey Lukanov]].  They began plotting to remove him, but had to move discreetly given the ubiquity of the CSS.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nIn October 1989, Mladenov organised a [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|CSCE]] environmental summit in Sofia.  He invited an independent group of Bulgarian environmental activists, Ecoglasnost, to participate.  Ten days into the conference, several Ecoglasnost activists and supporters were brutally beaten up by CSS and militia officers\u2014on orders from Zhivkov.  They then collared 36 other opposition activists, drove them to the countryside and forced them to walk back to Sofia.  Amid near-unanimous international condemnation, Mladenov, Lukanov and Atanasov decided that Zhivkov had to go.  In a critical step, they convinced Defence Minister [[Dobri Dzhurov]] to support them.<ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nThe plotters struck on 9 November, a day before a Politburo meeting.  Dzhurov met Zhivkov in private and told him that he needed to resign, and there was enough support on the Politburo to vote him out. Zhivkov was taken by surprise and tried to marshal support, to no avail. Just before the Politburo met on 10 November, Dzhurov gave Zhivkov an ultimatum\u2013unless Zhivkov resigned, the Politburo would not only vote him out, but have him executed. Seeing the writing on the wall after the motion calling for his removal passed, Zhivkov resigned, officially for reasons of age and health. Mladenov was elected his successor. On 17 November the National Assembly removed him from the post of Chairman of the State Council, replacing him with Mladenov.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/18/world/clamor-east-bulgarian-leader-hints-future-free-voting-other-changes.html|title=Bulgarian Leader Hints at Free Voting and Other Changes|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-11-18}}</ref><ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nOn 11 December, only a month after Zhivkov's ouster, Mladenov called for the Communist Party to give up its guaranteed right to rule.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/12/world/upheaval-east-bulgaria-s-communist-chief-plans-relax-grip-hold-elections.html|title=Bulgaria's Communist Chief Plans To Relax Grip and Hold Elections|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-12}}</ref> The Central Committee fell into line two days later, calling for free elections in the spring and asking the National Assembly to delete the portions of the Constitution that enshrined the party's \"leading role\".<ref name=expel>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/14/world/upheaval-in-the-east-communists-in-bulgaria-expel-zhivkov.html|title=Communists in Bulgaria Expel Zhivkov|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-14}}</ref>  On 15 January, the National Assembly struck out the portions of the constitution giving the Communist Party a monopoly of power.

On 13 December, Zhivkov was expelled from the party for what Lukanov described as \"gross violations of laws and gross mistakes in politics\".<ref name=expel/> Mladenov contended that Zhivkov's stewardship had left the country in \"a near heart-attack condition\".<ref name=expel/> The party also began an investigation into Zhivkov's high living.\n\nAfter being placed under house arrest on 18 January 1990, on 25 February 1991, Zhivkov was brought to stand trial on charges of [[embezzling]] the equivalent of $24 million (in 1990 dollars) in government funds. There had been calls to try him for political crimes as well, but prosecutors balked, believing they did not have enough evidence to convict him. On 4 September 1992 after an 18-month trial, he was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to seven years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/05/world/ousted-bulgarian-gets-7-year-term-for-embezzlement.html|title=Ousted Bulgarian Gets 7-Year Term For Embezzlement|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-09-05}}</ref> Due to old age and heart problems, he was allowed to serve his term under [[house arrest]] at his granddaughter's home.

Balkanec. 7 Sept.]</ref>\n\n===Political and social===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nAfter Zhivkov fell from the presidency and was expelled from the BCP, the Party gave up its monopoly on power in February 1990 and allowed Bulgaria's first democratic elections for 59 years [[1990 Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election|in June 1990]]. Like the Soviet Bloc in the face of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (SEV, Comecon), the [[Warsaw Pact Organization]] and the USSR itself collapsed, by 1992 Bulgaria entered a period of transition from socialism to a free market economy and democracy. The country's political ideology and foreign policies of Zhivkov's era have thus been reversed.\n\nZhivkov's onslaught on Bulgaria's Muslims and Turks radicalized and united what had been scattered and quiescent minorities. Since 2001 (and also from 1991 to 1994) the DPS ([[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]]) party, composed almost entirely of Bulgarian Turks, has held the balance of power in Bulgarian politics. Thus, one of the major Zhivkov projects produced the very opposite effect of what had been intended.\n\nA most damaging process, which emerged during the early years of Zhivkov's rule, was the \"demographic problem\" which saw traditionally large Bulgarian village families emigrate to industrial cities where they tended to have one child or none at all. The reforms undertaken during Zhivkov's regime consisted mostly of fines for families without children and limiting abortion.\n\n===Economic===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nOn the other hand, after very significant reverses and difficulties in the 1940s and 1950s, the Bulgarian economy developed apace from the mid-1960s until the late 1970s. Most of today's large industrial facilities such as the [[Kremikovtsi]] steelworks and the Chervena Mogila engineering works were built under Zhivkov. Bulgaria's nuclear power station, [[AEC Kozloduy]], was built in the 1970s, all six large reactors commissioned in under five years. This, and Bulgaria's many coal-fired and hydroelectric power stations, made the country a major electric power exporter. By the 1970s, the focus switched to high technologies such as electronics and even space exploration: on 10 April 1979 Bulgaria launched the first of two ''kosmonavti'' (cosmonauts), [[Georgi Ivanov (cosmonaut)|Georgi Ivanov]], aboard Soviet ''[[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]'' spaceships and later launched its own space satellites. Having been among the first nations to market electronic calculators (the [[ELKA]] brand, since 1973) and digital watches ([[Elektronika]], since 1975), in 1982 the country launched its [[Pravetz series 8|Pravets]] personal computer (a near-\"[[Apple II]] clone\") for business and domestic use. In the mid-1960s an economic reform package was introduced, which allowed for farmers to freely sell their overplanned production. Shortly after that Bulgaria became the first and only Eastern Bloc country which locally produced [[Coca-Cola]]. Mass tourism developed under Zhivkov's direction from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nHowever, this Bulgarian economy was exceptionally susceptible to Soviet largesse and Soviet-bloc markets. After the Soviet crude oil price shock of 1979, it entered a very severe recession from which it hardly recovered in the 1980s. After the early-1990s loss of Soviet and Comecon markets, this economy (unused to competing in a free market environment) entered prolonged and significant contraction. Zhivkov-era industrial facilities were largely unattractive to investors, many being left to decay. Great numbers of specialist personnel retired and died without being replaced, or else emigrated or left their state jobs for more lucrative private employment. As agriculture declined, tourism has emerged as almost the sole Zhivkov-era industrial survivor.

The following year he obtained a post at the ''Darzhavna pechatnitsa'', the official government publisher in [[Sofia]]. In 1932, he joined the BWP proper, later serving as secretary of its Second Borough Committee and as a member of its Sofia County Committee. Although the BWP was banned along with all other political parties after the uprising of [[1934 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|19 May 1934]], it continued fielding a handful of non-party National Assembly Deputies and Zhivkov retained his posts at its Sofia structure.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Zhivkov participated in Bulgaria's resistance movement against the country's alignment with [[Nazi Germany]] and was sympathetic to the country's 50,000 Jews.<ref>Bar-Zohar, Michael, ''Beyond Hitler's Grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews''. Adams Media Corp. 1998, p.199</ref> In 1943, he was involved in organising the [[Chavdar (resistance brigade)|Chavdar]] partisan detachment in and around his place of birth, becoming deputy commander of the Sofia operations area in the summer of 1944. Under his rule, many fellow former combatants with Chavdar were to rise to positions of prominence in Bulgarian affairs. He is said to have coordinated partisan movements with those of pro-Soviet army units during the [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|9 September 1944 uprising]].\n\n== Rise to power ==\n[[File:Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov.jpg|thumb|Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov in a Fatherland Front congress in 1946.]]\nAfter 9 September 1944, Zhivkov became head of the [[Sofia]] police force, restyled as the ''Narodna Militsiya'' (People's Militia). He was elected to the BCP [[Central Committee]] as a candidate member in 1945 and a full member in 1948. In the run-up to the 1949 treason trial against [[Traicho Kostov]], Zhivkov criticised the Party and judicial authorities for what he claimed was their leniency with regard to Kostov. This placed him in the [[Stalinist]] [[hardline]] wing of the Party. In 1950, Zhivkov became a candidate member of the BCP [[Politburo]], then led by [[Vulko Chervenkov]], leading to a full membership in 1951. In the years which followed, he was involved in countering countryside resistance to forced [[collective farming|farm collectivisation]] in northwestern Bulgaria.\n\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, an emphasis on shared leadership emerged. The hardline Stalinist Chervenkov gave up his post as General Secretary of the BCP in 1954. Zhivkov took his place, but Chervenkov retained most of his powers as [[prime minister]]. Bulgarian opinion at the time interpreted this as a self-preservation move by Chervenkov, since Zhivkov was a less well known figure in the party. After [[Nikita Khrushchev]] delivered his famous secret speech against Stalin at the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] 20th Congress, a BCP Central Committee plenary meeting was convened in April 1956 to agree to adopt a new Krushchevite line. At that ''plenum'', Zhivkov criticized Chervenkov as a disciple of Stalin, had him demoted from prime minister to a cabinet post, and promoted former [[Committee for State Security]] (CSS) head [[Anton Yugov]] to the post of prime minister. It was at this point that he became the ''de facto'' leader of Bulgaria. Subsequently, Zhivkov was associated with the \"April Line,\" which had [[anti-Stalinist]] credentials. At the BCP 8th Congress in late 1962, Zhivkov accused Yugov of anti-Party activity, expelled him from the BCP and had him placed under [[house arrest]].\n\nWith the increasingly strengthening positions of Zhivkov as the country's and Communist party's leader, former [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] leaders and active military took a critical stance on the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] policies of the communist leadership. In the events described as the \"[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|April Conspiracy]]\" of 1965 or the \"Plot of Gorunia,\" general [[Ivan Todorov-Gorunia]], general [[Tzviatko Anev]] (''\u0426\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043a\u043e \u0410\u043d\u0435\u0432'') and [[Tzolo \u041arastev]] (''\u0426\u043e\u043b\u043e \u041a\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0432'') organized a group of high-ranking military officers planning to overthrow the regime. Their plan was to establish a pro-Chinese leadership in the country. The coup was exposed and between 28 March and 12 April 1965 and most of the plotters were arrested.\n\nAs prime minister, Zhivkov then held both of Bulgaria's leading political and government posts; for nearly all of Bulgaria's existence as an independent nation, the prime minister has been reckoned as the country's leading political figure. Though the post of head of state was traditionally reserved for the leader of the surviving pro-Communist faction of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]], the \"[[Zhivkov Constitution]]\" adopted by referendum in July 1971 promoted him to chairman of the new State Council. The post, equivalent to that of president, confirmed his position as the country's top leader. Zhivkov remained faithful to Moscow during his 35 years in power, but adopted a more liberal stance than his predecessor by allowing some market reforms (such as allowing surplus agricultural goods to be sold for profit) and ending persecution of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\n== Policies ==\n=== Economic ===\nIn the mid-1950s, Soviet-style centralized planning produced economic indicators showing that Bulgarians were returning to their prewar lifestyle in some respects: real wages increased 75%, consumption of meat, fruit, and vegetables increased markedly, medical facilities and doctors became available to more of the population, and in 1957 collective farm workers benefited from the first agricultural pension and welfare system in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0062) Domestic Policy and Its Results], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1959 the Communist Party borrowed from the Chinese [[Great Leap Forward]] to symbolize a sudden burst of economic activity to be injected into the Third Five-Year Plan (1958\u20131962), whose original scope was quite conservative. According to the revised plan, industrial production would double and agricultural production would triple by 1962; a new agricultural collectivization and consolidation drive would achieve great economies of scale in that branch; investment in light industry would double, and foreign trade would expand.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Following the Chinese model, all of Bulgarian society was to be propagandized and mobilized to meet the planning goals.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Two purposes of the grandiose revised plan were to keep Bulgaria in step with the Soviet bloc, all of whose members were embarking on plans for accelerated growth, and to quell internal party conflicts. Amalgamation of collective farms cut their number by 70 percent, after which average farm acreage was second only to the Soviet Union among countries in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Plan\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The First Five-Year Plans], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov, whose \"theses\" had defined the goals of the plan, purged Politburo members and party rivals [[Boris Taskov]] (in 1959) and [[Anton Yugov]] (in 1962), citing their criticism of his policy as economically obstructionist. Already by 1960, however, Zhivkov had been forced to redefine the impossible goals of his theses.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Lack of skilled labor and materials made completion of projects at the prescribed pace impossible. Harvests were disastrously poor in the early 1960s; peasant unrest forced the government to raise food prices; and the urban dissatisfaction that resulted from higher prices compounded a crisis that broke in the summer of 1962. Blame fell on Zhivkov's experiments with decentralized planning, which was totally abandoned by 1963.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Despite this, by 1960 the value produced by heavy industry matched that of light industry, and food processing for export grew rapidly.<ref name=\"Plan\"/> Throughout the second phase, budget expenditures consisted primarily of reinvestment in sectors given initial priority. The completion of collectivization in 1958 had shifted 678,000 peasants, about 20 percent of the active labor force, into industrial jobs.<ref name=\"Plan\"/>\n\n[[File:BlockOs-68-Gl 3.JPG|thumb|right|Large-scale industrialization caused many laborers to move from rural to urban areas, which required the construction of numerous pre-fabricated apartment buildings such as this one in Sofia]]\n\nBy the early 1960s, however, changes to the system were obviously needed to achieve sustained growth in all branches of production, including agriculture.<ref name=\"Experimentation\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The Era of Experimentation and Reform], Library of Congress</ref> Specific incentives to reform were shortages of labor and energy and the growing importance of foreign trade in the \"thaw\" years of the mid-1960s. Consequently, in 1962 the Fourth Five-Year Plan began an era of economic reform that brought a series of new approaches to the old goal of [[intensive growth]].<ref name=\"Experimentation\"/> In industry the \"New System of Management\" was introduced in 1964 and lasted until 1968. This approach intended to streamline economic units and make enterprise managers more responsible for performance. In June 1964, about fifty industrial enterprises, mostly producers of [[textiles]] and other consumer goods, were placed under the new system. [[Wage]]s, bonuses, and investment funds were tied to enterprise profits, up to 70% of which could be retained.<ref name=\"Decentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0113) Industrial decentralization], Library of Congress</ref> Outside investment funds were to come primarily from [[bank credit]] rather than the [[state budget]]. In 1965 state subsidies still accounted for 63% of enterprise investment funds, however, while 30% came from retained enterprise earnings and only 7% from bank credits.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1970 budget subsidies accounted for only 27% of investment funds, while bank credits jumped to 39%, and retained enterprise earnings reached 34%.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> The pilot enterprises did very well, earning profits that were double the norm.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1967 two-thirds of industrial production came from firms under the new system, which by that time had embraced areas outside consumer production.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/>\n\n[[File:Cocacola cyrilic.JPG|thumb|left|upright|130px|Zhivkov's reforms resulted in some expansion of trade with the West, as evidenced by licensed [[Coca-Cola]] production since the 1960s with a [[Cyrillic]] logo]]\n\nBefore the end of the 1960s, however, Bulgarian economic planning moved back toward the conventional CPE approach. Many Western analysts attributed the Bulgarian retreat from the reforms of the 1960s to tension caused by the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968. International events may well have played a role, but the timing of the retreat and the invasion suggest another component: dissatisfaction among the Party elite with the results and ideological implications of the reform.<ref name=\"Recentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0114) Industrial Recentralization]</ref> For example, in July 1968, one month before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria's unorthodox, three-tiered pricing system was eliminated. The party leadership had never accepted the concept of free and flexible pricing for some products, which was an important Bulgarian departure from centralized planning in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> Resistance to reform was further encouraged by a series of cases in which major enterprise directors used newly decentralized financial resources to line their own pockets.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> However, some of the recentralization measures, such as the creation of an agricultural-industrial complex, also received domestic criticism.<ref name=\"Units\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0115) Larger Economic Units], Library of Congress</ref> Both Western and domestic customers remained dissatisfied with the quality of many Bulgarian manufactures. Party meetings and the press criticized monopolistic abuses resulting from irrational decisions at the top and poor implementation of rational policies at the enterprise level.<ref name=\"Units\"/>\n\nAfter a relative stagnation in the 1970s, the New Economic Model (NEM), instituted in 1981 as the latest economic reform program, seemingly improved the supply of consumer goods and generally upgraded the economy.<ref name=\"1980s\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) Bulgaria in the 1980s], Library of Congress</ref> In an effort to remedy the [[shortage economy|chronic distribution problems]] of the central economy, higher economic institutions became financially accountable for damage inflicted by their decisions on subordinate levels.<ref name=\"NEM\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0116) The New Economic Model], Library of Congress</ref> Complexes or associations were given explicit freedom to sign their own contracts with suppliers and customers at home and abroad.<ref name=\"NEM\"/> However, NEM was unable to drastically improve the quality or quantity of Bulgarian goods and produce. In 1983 Zhivkov harshly criticized all of Bulgarian industry and agriculture in a major speech, but the reforms generated by his speech did nothing to improve the situation.<ref name=\"1980s\"/> A large percentage of high-quality domestic goods were shipped abroad in the early 1980s to shrink Bulgaria's hard-currency debt, and the purchase of Western technology was sacrificed for the same reason, crippling technical advancement and disillusioning consumers. The NEM proved to be a failure, and GNP growth between 1981 and 1982 was only 2.9%.<ref name=\"Last round\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0117) Last Round of Zhivkov Reforms], Library of Congress</ref> By 1984 Bulgaria was suffering a serious energy shortage because its [[Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant|Soviet-made nuclear power plant]] was undependable and droughts reduced the productivity of hydroelectric plants.<ref name=\"1980s\"/> Bulgaria marked significant progress in scientific research by [[Bulgarian cosmonaut program|sending two men in space]] and supplying 70% of all electronics in the Eastern Bloc,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14354979.html |title=Milliarden Dollar Schulden in Moskau.

This led to a Bulgarian version of the Soviet [[perestroika]] program. After a round of failed experimental measures, in January 1989 the Party issued Decree Number 56. This decree established \"firms\" as the primary unit of economic management.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> In a fundamental departure from the socialist prohibition of private citizens hiring labor, as many as ten people could now be hired permanently, and an unlimited number could be hired on temporary contracts.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> This last round of reforms by the Zhivkov regime confused rather than improved economic performance. However, statistics on growth for 1986-88 still indicated a 5.5% annual rate, up from the 3.7% rate achieved during the previous five-year plan.<ref name=\"Last round\"/>\n\n=== Social ===\n[[File:Gini since WWII.svg|right|thumb|230px|Zhivkov's social policies resulted in Bulgaria having [[Gini coefficient]] of 18 in the 1970s, ranking among the countries with the lowest levels of [[income inequality]] in the world]]\n\nEven before Zhivkov, Bulgaria made significant progress in increasing life expectancy and decreasing infant mortality rates. Consistent social policies led to an increase in life expectancy to 68.1 years for men and 74.4 years for women.<ref name=\"Health\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0099) Health], Library of Congress</ref> In 1939 the mortality rate for children under one year had been 138.9 per 1,000; by 1986 it was 18.2 per 1,000, and in 1990 it was 14 per 1,000, the lowest rate in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Health\"/> The proportion of long-lived people in Bulgaria was quite large; a 1988 study cited a figure of 52 centenarians per 1 million inhabitants. One of the first mass HIV testing programs was initiated under Zhivkov, and as of October 1989, some 2.5 million people in Bulgaria, including about 66,000 foreigners, had been tested for HIV, and 81 Bulgarians were diagnosed as HIV positive.<ref name=\"Health\"/> Increases in real incomes in agriculture rose by 6.7 percent per year during the 1960s. During this same period, industrial wages increased by 4.9 percent annually.<ref name=\"Standards\"/> Availability of consumer durables significantly improved in the 1970s. According to official statistics, between 1965 and 1988 the number of televisions per 100 households increased from 8 to 100; radios increased from 59 to 95; refrigerators from 5 to 96; washing machines from 23 to 96; and automobiles from 2 to 40. Available automobiles were primarily Soviet Fiats, some of which were manufactured in Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Standards\"/>\n\nIn the postwar era, and especially under Zhivkov, housing in Bulgaria improved significantly as more and better-quality homes were built.<ref name=\"Housing\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0100) Housing], Library of Congress</ref> However, many of them were cramped - the average home in Bulgaria had three rooms and an area of {{convert|65|m2}}.<ref name=\"Housing\"/> Housing remained one of the most serious shortcomings in the Bulgarian standard of living throughout Zhivkov's rule. Residential construction targets in the Five-Year Plans were regularly underfulfilled. Consequently, families often waited several years for apartments; in Sofia, where overcrowding was at its worst, the wait was as long as ten years.<ref name=\"Standards\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0144) Standards of living], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nThe educational system, despite the addition of ideological subjects, remained relatively unchanged after the beginning of the Communist era. In 1979 Zhivkov introduced a sweeping educational reform, claiming that [[Marxism|Marxist]] teachings on educating youth were still not being applied completely.<ref name=\"Education\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0101) Education], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov therefore created Unified Secondary Polytechnical Schools (''Edinni sredni politekhnicheski uchilishta'', ESPU), in which all students would receive the same general education. The system united previously separate specialized middle schools in a single, twelve-grade program heavily emphasizing technical subjects. In 1981 a national program introduced [[computer]]s to most of the ESPUs.<ref name=\"Education\"/>\n\n=== Foreign ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K0615-0001-141, Berlin, VIII.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Bulgaria improved its diplomatic relations with nations outside the Soviet sphere.<ref name=\"Foreign Policy\"/> The 1970s was a period of closeness between [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's]] USSR and Zhivkov's Bulgaria. Zhivkov was awarded the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] in 1977.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=2164 Biography] at the website on Heroes of the Soviet Union and Russia</ref> Yet, though Bulgarian ''\u00e9migr\u00e9'' dissident [[Georgi Markov]] wrote that \"[Zhivkov] served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet leaders themselves did,\" in many ways he can be said to have exploited the USSR for political purposes, with Bulgaria serving a buffer between the USSR and NATO. Thus, he claims in his memoirs that the USSR had become \"a raw material appendage to Bulgaria,\" something obliquely confirmed by Gorbachev when he wrote in his memoirs that \"Bulgaria was a country which had lived beyond its means for a long time.\" An example of how the \"raw material appendage\" was exploited was the trade in Soviet [[crude oil]]. This would be shipped to Bulgaria's modern [[Oil refinery|refinery]] in [[Burgas]] at subsidized prices, processed, and resold on world markets at a huge premium.\n\nIn 1963 and 1973, the Zhivkov regime made requests \u2014 it is unclear how far these were in earnest \u2014 that\nBulgaria be incorporated into the USSR, both times because the Bulgarian government, having engaged in\nbitter polemics with [[Yugoslavia]] over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], feared a Soviet\u2013Yugoslav reconciliation at its own expense. In 1963, following the decision of [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow]] to recognize the autonomy of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]], the Bulgarian leaders openly declared that there was no \"historic Macedonian nation.\" In the face of Moscow's post-1953 efforts to reach out to Belgrade and Athens, Zhivkov seems to have calculated that a policy of unswerving loyalty to the Kremlin would ensure that it remained more valuable for the USSR than non-aligned Yugoslavia or NATO-affiliated Greece.<ref>Bal\u00e1zs Szalontai, Political and Economic Relations between Communist States. In: Stephen Anthony Smith (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook in the History of Communism'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 314.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bulgaria gave official military support to many national liberation causes, most notably in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, ([[North Vietnam]]), [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], [[People's Republic of Angola|Angola]], Afghanistan, the [[Horn of Africa]], and the [[Middle East]]. In 1984 the 9,000 Bulgarian advisers stationed in Libya for military and nonmilitary aid put that country in first place among Bulgaria's [[Third World]] clients. Through its Kintex arms export enterprise, Bulgaria also engaged in covert military support activities, many of which were subsequently disclosed. In the 1970s, diplomatic crises with [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] were triggered by Bulgarian involvement in coup plots.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/>\n\nUnder Zhivkov Bulgaria's policy toward [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States]] was determined largely by the position of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Western Europe\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0193) Western Europe and the US], Library of Congress</ref> Events such as the invasions of Czechoslovakia and [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] automatically distanced Bulgaria from the West; then, in the early 1980s Soviet efforts to split NATO by cultivating Western Europe brought Bulgaria closer to [[France]] and [[West Germany]] - a position that continued through the 1980s. Even back in the 1970s, Zhivkov actively pursued better relations with the West, overcoming conservative opposition and the tentative, tourism-based approach to the West taken as early as the 1960s.<ref name=\"Affairs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0066) Foreign Affairs in the 1960s-70s], Library of Congress</ref> Emulating Soviet d\u00e9tente policy of the 1970s, Bulgaria gained Western technology, expanded cultural contacts, and attracted Western investments with the most liberal foreign investment policy in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> As in 1956 and 1968, however, Soviet actions altered Bulgaria's position. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in late 1979, which Bulgaria supported vigorously, renewed tension between Bulgaria and the West. Alleged Bulgarian implication in the attempted assassination of Pope [[John Paul II]] in 1981 exacerbated the problem and kept relations cool through the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> A 1988 application for membership in the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] was refused because of the Turkish assimilation program, after widespread expectations of success.<ref name=\"Western Europe\"/>\n\nBulgarian relations with Greece, a traditional enemy, were stable throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in spite of major government changes in both countries. Zhivkov made this stability a model for the overall Balkan cooperation that was a centerpiece of his foreign policy in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Greece\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0190) Greece]</ref> In 1986 the two countries signed a declaration of good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation that was based on mutual enmity toward Turkey and toward Yugoslav demands for recognition of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] minorities in Bulgaria and Greece. An important motivation for friendship with Greece was to exploit [[NATO]]'s Greek-Turkish split, which was based on the claims of the two countries in [[Cyprus]]. In early 1989, Bulgaria signed a ten-year bilateral economic agreement with Greece.<ref name=\"Greece\"/>\n\n=== Cultural ===\n\nUntil the late 1980s, Zhivkov successfully prevented unrest in the Bulgarian intellectual community.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0181) Zhivkov and the Intelligentsia], Library of Congress</ref> Membership in the writers' union brought enormous privilege and social stature, and that drew many dissident writers such as Georgi Dzhagarov and Lyubomir Levchev into the circle of the officially approved intelligentsia. On the other hand, entry required intellectual compromise, and refusal to compromise led to dismissal from the union and loss of all privileges. The punishment of dissident writers sometimes went far beyond loss of privileges. In 1978 \u00e9migr\u00e9 writer [[Georgi Markov]] was murdered in London for his anticommunist broadcasts for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and [[Blaga Dimitrova]] was harshly denounced for her critical portrayal of party officials in her 1982 novel ''Litse''.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/>\n\nZhivkov also softened organized opposition by restoring symbols of the Bulgarian cultural past that had been cast aside in the postwar campaign to consolidate Soviet-style party control. Beginning in 1967, he appealed loudly to the people to remember \"our motherland Bulgaria\".<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> In the late 1970s, Zhivkov mended relations with the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> Zhivkov's extensive campaign of cultural restoration provided at least some common ground between him and the Bulgarian intelligentsia. In 1980 Zhivkov had improved his domestic position by appointing his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] as chair of the commission on science, culture, and art.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0068) The Political Atmosphere in the 1970s], Library of Congress</ref> In this powerful position, Zhivkova became extremely popular by promoting Bulgaria's separate national cultural heritage. She spent large sums of money in a highly visible campaign to support scholars, collect Bulgarian art, and sponsor cultural institutions. Among her policies was closer cultural contact with the West; her most visible project was the spectacular national celebration of [[1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State|Bulgaria's 1,300th anniversary]] in 1981. When Zhivkova died in 1981, relations with the West had already been chilled by the Afghanistan issue, but her brief administration of Bulgaria's official cultural life was a successful phase of her father's appeal to Bulgarian national tradition to bind the country together.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\"/>\n\nSports also prospered during Zhivkov's rule. From 1956 to 1988, Bulgaria won an unprecedented 153 Olympic medals and numerous European and world competitions in sports as diverse as [[volleyball]], [[rhythmic gymnastics]] and [[wrestling]].\n\n== Dissent and human rights violations ==\n\nDissent was punished under Zhivkov's rule. The CSS was a feared tool of control, and overt opposition largely stayed underground until the late 1980s. In 1978, the Bulgarian dissident [[Georgi Markov]] was assassinated in London by an agent who stabbed him with an umbrella tip which implanted a very small [[ricin]] ball. According to former [[KGB]] [[general]] [[Oleg Kalugin]], this was requested by Zhivkov and either performed by the [[KGB]] or it assisted the CSS; the actual assassin is reputed to have been [[Francesco Gullino]], working for the CSS. In Zhivkov's time, Bulgarians found it extremely difficult to travel abroad.\n\nZhivkov was particularly intolerant of dissent within the Party.  When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced his reform program, Zhivkov made a show of copying it, believing that Gorbachev wasn't really serious about ''[[glasnost]]'' or ''[[perestroika]].''<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>  However, he showed his true colors when he expelled several members of a human-rights watch group from the Party. Soon afterward, when several intellectuals announced the formation of the \"Club for the Support of Perestroika and Glasnost,\" he arrested the leaders and threw them out of the Party.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008|last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |ISBN=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Unreferenced section : == Nepotism and insistence on ''predanost'' ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nZhivkov married Mara Maleeva (1911\u20131971) in 1938. They had two children, both would be promoted in the BCP hierarchy, daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] and son Vladimir Zhivkov. Lyudmila became a Politburo member and earned the ire of the BCP and Bulgaria's benefactors in [[Moscow]] with her unorthodox artistic ideas and practice of Eastern religions. She died abruptly at the age of 38 in 1981. Her health was severely compromised by stress, failed marriages, and unusual dietary/lifestyle practices, although rumours of assassination or suicide abounded. With Lyudmila's death, her friends and supporters were quickly removed from all positions of power. Son-in-law [[Ivan Slavkov]] was made chairman of Bulgaria's state television company and later became president of the [[Bulgarian Olympic Committee]].\n\nApart from promoting his family, Zhivkov instituted a complex system of privileges which extended to former Resistance figures, Party members and ''prominenti'' of the sciences, arts and manufacture. In the early 1960s, he was instrumental in constructing a large set of housing, financial, educational, electoral and other benefits to be granted to a large category of people called \"Active Fighters against Capitalism and Fascism\" who had ostensibly been members of the rather modest Bulgarian Wartime resistance and which was expanded to absurd proportions. Without necessarily receiving great remuneration (pay differentials under Zhivkov were within the 5:1 range, with the overwhelming majority of salaries being within the 3:1 range), Party members and CSS informers received very significant perquisites which involved access to accommodation, luxury imported goods, hard currency, the ability to travel abroad, superior medical and dental treatment and unhindered entry to higher education for their children. The scope of these privileges broadened as they rose in the Party hierarchy. Eminent artists, scientists and \"Heroes of Socialist Labour\" (mostly collective farmers and shop-floor workers) received similar privileges. Established in the early years of Zhivkov's terms in power, [[Corecom]] was a retail chain in which foreigners could shop with hard currency, but its main customers were privileged Bulgarians close to the Zhivkov regime.\n\nIn Zhivkov's Bulgaria, money had lost many of its traditional properties, being replaced by sets of complex personal and family material and career considerations which have been described as \"feudal\". This hampered the prosecution in post-Zhivkov fraud and corruption trials, since no venality could be proved against those charged: they had merely received goods in kind and services which moreover had been their \"legal due\".\n\nZhivkov reserved a special attention for his birthplace of [[Pravets]]. In the 1960s this small village was declared \"an Urban Community,\" becoming a town a decade later. In 1982 Bulgaria's first Apple clone personal computer was named the ''Pravets''. The grateful citizens of Pravets responded by erecting a heroic statue to Zhivkov which he duly had taken down, ostensibly to prevent a personal cult growing around him. It was re-erected after his death.\n\nThroughout his tenure of power, Zhivkov surrounded himself with those who exhibited ''predanost'' (loyalty, devotion, the desire to proffer all). In his reminiscences, Vladimir Kostov, a Bulgarian secret agent who defected to [[France]] in 1978, recalls how the powerful minister of internal affairs would suffer nervous episodes before meeting Zhivkov lest his ''predanost'' should fail to come across sufficiently expressively..-->\n\n== Image ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThroughout his tenure, Zhivkov's [[dialect]] and poor manners made him the butt of many acerbic jibes and jokes in Bulgaria's urbane circles. While the feared CSS secret police was commonly said to persecute those who told political jokes, Zhivkov himself was said to have found them amusing and \"collected\" an archive of them. His popular nickname was \"bai Tosho\" (approximately \"Ol' Uncle Tosho\") or occasionally (and later) \"Tato\" (a dialectal word for [[Father|\"Dad\" or \"Pop\"]]). Markov tells a story of how Zhivkov reproached a popular newspaper cartoonist for modifying his signature to resemble a pig's tail, yet did not persecute him. A handful of satirist dissidents such as [[Radoy Ralin]] enjoyed some prominence, although Ralin was not favored by the authorities due to his sharp satire.\n\nZhivkov survived the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Khrushchev's fall in October 1964, an attempted Stalinist-Maoist ''[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|coup d\u2019\u00e9tat]]'' in 1965, his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]]'s death in 1981, [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's death]] in 1982, and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s post-1985 reforms.\n\n== Fall ==\n\nIn December 1984, Todor Zhivkov began a campaign of forcible assimilation of Bulgaria's Turkish minority, most notably forcing all Turks to take Bulgarian names. By 1989, resistance to this policy led to riots, which resulted in multiple deaths. In May 1989, Zhivkov ordered an expulsion of Turks (and Muslims) to Turkey across the then [[Iron Curtain]] boundary between these two countries. This led to the largest [[ethnic cleansing]] in Europe during the [[Cold War]], in which over 360,000 Turks (and Muslims) were targeted within three months.<ref>See:'2. \u041e\u0431\u044f\u0432\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434 360 000 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 1989 \u0433. \u0437\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u0438\u0437\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c.'

Bulgaria was the target of near-unanimous condemnation from the international community; even the Soviets protested. Gorbachev already did not think much of Zhivkov; he had lumped Zhivkov in with a group of inflexible hardliners that included [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia's]] [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania's]] [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]].  However, after the Turkish episode, he was determined to see Zhivkov gone.  The Turkish affair also alarmed several high-ranking Bulgarian officials as well, including [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] [[Georgi Atanasov (politician)|Georgi Atanasov]], Foreign Minister [[Petar Mladenov]] and Finance Minister [[Andrey Lukanov]].  They began plotting to remove him, but had to move discreetly given the ubiquity of the CSS.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nIn October 1989, Mladenov organised a [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|CSCE]] environmental summit in Sofia.  He invited an independent group of Bulgarian environmental activists, Ecoglasnost, to participate.  Ten days into the conference, several Ecoglasnost activists and supporters were brutally beaten up by CSS and militia officers\u2014on orders from Zhivkov.  They then collared 36 other opposition activists, drove them to the countryside and forced them to walk back to Sofia.  Amid near-unanimous international condemnation, Mladenov, Lukanov and Atansov decided that Zhivkov had to go.  In a critical step, they convinced Defence Minister [[Dobri Dzhurov]] to support them.<ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nThe plotters struck on 9 November, a day before a Politburo meeting.  Dzhurov met Zhivkov in private and told him that he needed to resign, and there was enough support on the Politburo to vote him out. Zhivkov was taken by surprise and tried to marshal support, to no avail. Just before the Politburo met on 10 November, Dzhurov gave Zhivkov an ultimatum\u2013unless Zhivkov resigned, the Politburo would not only vote him out, but have him executed. Seeing the writing on the wall after the motion calling for his removal passed, Zhivkov resigned, officially for reasons of age and health. Mladenov was elected his successor. On 17 November the National Assembly removed him from the post of Chairman of the State Council, replacing him with Mladenov.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/18/world/clamor-east-bulgarian-leader-hints-future-free-voting-other-changes.html|title=Bulgarian Leader Hints at Free Voting and Other Changes|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-11-18}}</ref><ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nOn 11 December, only a month after Zhivkov's ouster, Mladenov called for the Communist Party to give up its guaranteed right to rule.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/12/world/upheaval-east-bulgaria-s-communist-chief-plans-relax-grip-hold-elections.html|title=Bulgaria's Communist Chief Plans To Relax Grip and Hold Elections|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-12}}</ref> The Central Committee fell into line two days later, calling for free elections in the spring and asking the National Assembly to delete the portions of the Constitution that enshrined the party's \"leading role\".<ref name=expel>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/14/world/upheaval-in-the-east-communists-in-bulgaria-expel-zhivkov.html|title=Communists in Bulgaria Expel Zhivkov|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-14}}</ref>  On 15 January, the National Assembly struck out the portions of the constitution giving the Communist Party a monopoly of power.

There had been calls to try him for political crimes as well, but prosecutors balked, believing they did not have enough evidence to convict him. On 4 September 1992 after an 18-month trial, he was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to seven years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/05/world/ousted-bulgarian-gets-7-year-term-for-embezzlement.html|title=Ousted Bulgarian Gets 7-Year Term For Embezzlement|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-09-05}}</ref> Due to old age and heart problems, he was allowed to serve his term under [[house arrest]] at his granddaughter's home.

Balkanec. 7 Sept.]</ref>\n\n===Political and social===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nAfter Zhivkov fell from the presidency and was expelled from the BCP, the Party gave up its monopoly on power in February 1990 and allowed Bulgaria's first democratic elections for 59 years [[1990 Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election|in June 1990]]. Like the Soviet Bloc in the face of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (SEV, Comecon), the [[Warsaw Pact Organization]] and the USSR itself collapsed, by 1992 Bulgaria entered a period of transition from socialism to a free market economy and democracy. The country's political ideology and foreign policies of Zhivkov's era have thus been reversed.\n\nZhivkov's onslaught on Bulgaria's Muslims and Turks radicalized and united what had been scattered and quiescent minorities. Since 2001 (and also from 1991 to 1994) the DPS ([[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]]) party, composed almost entirely of Bulgarian Turks, has held the balance of power in Bulgarian politics. Thus, one of the major Zhivkov projects produced the very opposite effect of what had been intended.\n\nA most damaging process, which emerged during the early years of Zhivkov's rule, was the \"demographic problem\" which saw traditionally large Bulgarian village families emigrate to industrial cities where they tended to have one child or none at all. The reforms undertaken during Zhivkov's regime consisted mostly of fines for families without children and limiting abortion.\n\n===Economic===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nOn the other hand, after very significant reverses and difficulties in the 1940s and 1950s, the Bulgarian economy developed apace from the mid-1960s until the late 1970s. Most of today's large industrial facilities such as the [[Kremikovtsi]] steelworks and the Chervena Mogila engineering works were built under Zhivkov. Bulgaria's nuclear power station, [[AEC Kozloduy]], was built in the 1970s, all six large reactors commissioned in under five years. This, and Bulgaria's many coal-fired and hydroelectric power stations, made the country a major electric power exporter. By the 1970s, the focus switched to high technologies such as electronics and even space exploration: on 10 April 1979 Bulgaria launched the first of two ''kosmonavti'' (cosmonauts), [[Georgi Ivanov (cosmonaut)|Georgi Ivanov]], aboard Soviet ''[[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]'' spaceships and later launched its own space satellites. Having been among the first nations to market electronic calculators (the [[ELKA]] brand, since 1973) and digital watches ([[Elektronika]], since 1975), in 1982 the country launched its [[Pravetz series 8|Pravets]] personal computer (a near-\"[[Apple II]] clone\") for business and domestic use. In the mid-1960s an economic reform package was introduced, which allowed for farmers to freely sell their overplanned production. Shortly after that Bulgaria became the first and only Eastern Bloc country which locally produced [[Coca-Cola]]. Mass tourism developed under Zhivkov's direction from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nHowever, this Bulgarian economy was exceptionally susceptible to Soviet largesse and Soviet-bloc markets. After the Soviet crude oil price shock of 1979, it entered a very severe recession from which it hardly recovered in the 1980s. After the early-1990s loss of Soviet and Comecon markets, this economy (unused to competing in a free market environment) entered prolonged and significant contraction. Zhivkov-era industrial facilities were largely unattractive to investors, many being left to decay. Great numbers of specialist personnel retired and died without being replaced, or else emigrated or left their state jobs for more lucrative private employment. As agriculture declined, tourism has emerged as almost the sole Zhivkov-era industrial survivor. It is however widely regarded that incompetent administration after 1989 had a much greater effect on the decline of the economy, as even successful industries declined.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n;Bulgaria\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Order of Georgi Dimitrov]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of Socialist Labour|Hero of Socialist Labour (Bulgaria)]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of the People's Republic of Bulgaria]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: Grand Master of the [[Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius|Order of Cyril and Methodius]]\n\n;Foreign\n* {{Flag|Soviet Union}}: [[Gold Star]] [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] (No. 11281) (31 May 1977 - for his contribution to the fight against fascism in the Second World War)\n* {{Flag|Soviet Union}}: Two [[Orders of Lenin]]\n* {{Flag|Portugal}}: Grand Collar of the [[Order of Infante Dom Henrique]] (21 August 1979)\n* {{Flag|Cuba}}: [[Order of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Todor Zhivkov}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{Succession box| before = [[Georgi Traikov]] (as chairman of the National Assembly Presidium)| title = [[List of Presidents of Bulgaria|Chairman of the State Council]]|years=7 July 1971 \u2013 17 November 1989| after = [[Petar Mladenov]]}}\n{{Succession box|title=[[List of Prime Ministers of Bulgaria|Prime Minister of Bulgaria]] |before=[[Anton Yugov]]|after= [[Stanko Todorov]]|years=19 November 1962 \u2013 7 July 1971}}\n{{s-ppo}}\n{{Succession box| before = [[Vulko Chervenkov]]| title = [[Bulgarian Communist Party|General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party]]|years=4 March 1954 \u2013 10 November 1989| after = [[Petar Mladenov]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{BulgarianPresidents}}\n{{BulgarianPrimeMinisters}}\n{{Leaders of the Ruling Parties of the Eastern Bloc}}\n{{Fall of Communism}}\n{{Cold War}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zhivkov, Todor}}\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Pravets]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian Communist Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian Socialist Party politicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Bulgarian politicians]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian anti-fascists]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian atheists]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian communists]]\n[[Category:Collaborators with the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Georgi Dimitrov]]\n[[Category:Heroes of the People's Republic of Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin]]\n[[Category:Grand Collars of the Order of Prince Henry]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Jos\u00e9 Marti]]\n[[Category:Mayors of Sofia]]\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian resistance members]]\n[[Category:Communist rulers]]\n[[Category:Burials at Central Sofia Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Former Bulgarian Orthodox Christians]]\n[[Category:Deaths from pneumonia]]\n[[Category:Foreign Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Heads of regimes who were later imprisoned]]\n[[Category:Politicians convicted of embezzlement]]\n", "name_user": "Ymblanter", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFall", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todor_Zhivkov"}
{"title_page": "Persian metres", "text_new": "'''Persian metres''' are patterns of long and short syllables in Persian poetry.\n\nOver the past 1000 years the Persian language has enjoyed a rich literature, especially of poetry. Until the advent of free verse in the 20th century, this poetry was always quantitative\u2014that is the lines were composed in various patterns of long and short syllables. The different patterns are known as metres (US: meters). A knowledge of metre is essential for someone to correctly recite Persian poetry\u2014and also often, since short vowels are not written in Persian script, to convey the correct meaning in cases of ambiguity. It is also helpful for those who memorise the verse.\n\nMetres in Persian have traditionally been analysed in terms of Arabic metres, from which they are supposed to have been adapted. However, in recent years it has been recognised that for the most part Persian metres developed independently from those in Arabic, and there has been a movement to analyse them on their own terms.\n\nAn unusual feature of Persian poetry not found in Arabic, Latin, or Ancient Greek verse is that instead of two lengths of syllables (short and long), there are three lengths (short, long, and overlong). Overlong syllables can be used instead of a long syllable plus a short one.\n\nPersian metres were used not only in classical Persian poetry, but were also imitated in Turkish poetry of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period,<ref>Deo & Kiparsky (2011), p. 7.</ref> and in Urdu poetry under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors.<ref>See external links (Pritchett).</ref> That the poets of Turkey and India copied Persian metres, not Arabic ones, is clear from the fact that, just as with Persian verse, the most commonly used metres of Arabic poetry (the [[Tawil|''\u1e6daw\u012bl'']], [[Kamil (metre)|''k\u0101mil'']], [[wafir|''w\u0101fir'']] and [[basit|''bas\u012b\u1e6d'']]) are avoided, while those metres used most frequently in Persian lyric poetry are exactly those most frequent in Turkish and Urdu.<ref name=DK7>Deo & Kiparsky, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Quantitative verse==\nClassical Persian poetry is based not on stress but on quantity, that is, on the length of syllables. A syllable ending in a short vowel is short (u), but one ending in a long vowel or a consonant is long (\u2013). Thus a word like ''ja-h\u0101n'' \"world\" is considered to have a short syllable plus a long one (u \u2013), whereas ''far-d\u0101'' \"tomorrow\" consists of two long syllables (\u2013 \u2013). A word like ''na-fas'' \"breath\" is usually considered to have a short syllable plus a long one (u \u2013), but if a vowel follows, as in ''na-fa-s\u012b'' \"a breath\", the second syllable is short (u u \u2013).\n\nA characteristic feature of classical Persian verse is that in addition to long and short syllables, it also has \"overlong\" syllables. These are syllables consisting of any vowel + two consonants, such as {{lang|fa-Latn|panj}} \"five\" or {{lang|fa-Latn|d\u016bst}} \"friend\", or a long vowel + one consonant (other than ''n''), for example {{lang|fa-Latn|r\u016bz}} \"day\" or {{lang|fa-Latn|b\u0101d}} \"wind\". In the metre of a poem, an overlong syllable can take the place of any sequence of \"long + short\". They can also be used at the end of a line, in which case the difference between long and overlong is neutralised.\n\nIn modern colloquial pronunciation, the difference in length between long and short vowels is mostly not observed (see [[Persian phonology]]), but when reciting poetry the long vowels are pronounced longer than the short ones.<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 5.</ref> When a recording of Persian verse is analysed, it can be seen that long syllables are on average pronounced longer than short ones, and overlong syllables are longer still (see below for details).\n\nIn this article, the following scansion symbols are used:\n*u = a short syllable\n*\u2013 = a long syllable\n*\u2013u = an overlong syllable\n*x = ''[[anceps]]'', that is: some metres allow either a long or short syllable at the beginning of a line.\n*<u>u u</u> = ''[[Biceps (prosody)|biceps]]'', that is, a pair of short syllables that can be freely replaced by one long syllable. Mainly this occurs when a line ends in u&nbsp;u&nbsp;\u2013, rarely elsewhere.\n\n==Metrical patterns==\nFrom a metrical point of view, classical Persian poetry can be divided into three types. \n\n===Masnavi===\nThe first type is poems in rhyming couplets, known as [[Mathnawi|''masnavi'']] (plural {{lang|fa-Latn|masnav\u012by\u0101t}}).<ref>The word is derived from the Arabic word for \"two\", {{lang|ar-Latn|i\u03b8n\u0101n}}: Thiesen (1982), p. 78.</ref> These are almost always written in one of seven different metres consisting of 11 (or in one case of 10) syllables, and each couplet has its own separate rhyme. The 11-syllable tradition may go back to pre-Islamic times, since 11-syllable poetry seems to have been common at that time.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1975), p. 91.</ref>\n\nSome of the poems written in the ''masnavi'' form are very long, of up to 50,000 couplets. The most common of the metres used are the following (Elwell-Sutton's code follows each metre):\n:u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 (e.g. Ferdowsi's ''[[Shahnameh]]'' or Saadi's ''[[Bustan (book)|Bustan]]''): 1.1.11\n:u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 (e.g. Gorgani's ''[[Vis and Ramin]]'' or Nezami's ''[[Khosrow and Shirin]]''): 2.1.11\n:\u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 (e.g. Rumi's ''[[Masnavi|Masnavi-\u0113 Ma'nav\u012b]]'' or Attar's ''[[The Conference of the Birds|Conference of the Birds]]''): 2.4.11\n:\u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 (e.g. Nezami's ''[[Layla and Majnun|Leyli and Majnun]]''): 5.1.10<ref>The feet are unclear; cf. Farzaad (1967), p. 60; Hayes (1979), p. 214.</ref>\n:x u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 (e.g. [[Sanai]]'s ''Had\u012bqatu-l-Haq\u012bqa'' or Nezami's ''[[Haft Peykar|Seven Portraits]]''): 4.5.11\n\nSome shorter poems also, such as many of those in [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]]'s ''[[Gulistan (book)|Golest\u0101n]]'', are also written in rhyming couplets in one or another of these metres, a famous example being ''[[Bani Adam|Ban\u012b \u0100dam]]'' from the ''Golest\u0101n'', which consists of three rhyming couplets in the first of the above metres.\n\nThe 12th-century poet [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nezami]] famously wrote a set of 5 ''masnav\u012by\u0101t'', each in a different one of the above metres, totalling nearly 29,000 couplets in all.<ref>Parrello, Domenico (2000/2010). [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kamsa-of-nezami \"\u1e34amsa of Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b\"]. ''Encyclopaedia Iranica online''.</ref> Such a quintet was known as a ''khamsa'' or ''khamse'' (from the Arabic {{lang|ar|\u062e\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0629}} ''xamsa'' \"(group of) five\"), and the practice was later imitated by other poets such as [[Amir Khusrau|Amir Khosrow]] of Delhi and [[Khwaju Kermani]] of Shiraz.\n\n===Lyric poetry===\nThe second type of Persian poetry is lyric poetry, such as the [[ghazal]]s of [[Hafez]], or the spiritual poems in [[Rumi]]'s collection known as the [[Diwan-e Shams-e Tabrizi]]. These tend to be in longer metres, usually of 14 to 16 syllables long, in [[tetrameter]] form (i.e. with four feet in each [[hemistich]] or half-verse).\n\nAbout 30 different metres are commonly used for lyric poems, but 70% of the poems are written in one of the following seven metres:<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976) ''The Persian Metres'', p. 162.</ref>\n:u \u2013 u \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 (15 syllables): 4.1.15\n:\u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 (14 syllables): 4.7.14\n:\u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 (15 syllables): 2.4.15\n:x u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 (15 syllables): 3.1.15\n:x u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 (11 syllables): 4.5.11\n:u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 (16 syllables): 2.1.16\n:\u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 (14 syllables): 3.3.14\n\nThe shorter metre 4.5.11 is frequently used for ''masnav\u012by\u0101t'', but can also be used for lyric writing, such as in eight of Hafez's ghazals.<ref>Nos. 13, 42, 56, 262, 270, 302, 381, 453; Thiesen (1982), p. 150.</ref> \n\nOccasionally a metre is made up of two short sections, the second a repetition of the first, such as the following:\n:\u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 || \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 (7 + 7 syllables): 3.4.7(2) = 4.4.7(2)\n\nThe majority of lyric poetry is composed in the form of couplets, in which the first couplet is rhyming couplet, and then the same rhyme is used at the end of every couplet until the end of the poem. A minority of lyric poetry is composed in stanzas with more complicated rhyme schemes.\n\nBoth in ''masnav\u012by\u0101t'' and in lyric poems the same metre is used in every line, the only variation being the occasional substitution of an overlong syllable for \"long + short\", and sometimes (especially near the end of a line) the substitution of a single long syllable for two short ones. Another source of variety is the word accent, which changes from line to line, thus avoiding monotony.\n\n===Ruba'i===\nThe third type of poetry is the [[ruba'i]] or quatrain, such as the ''rubaiyat'' of [[Omar Khayyam]]. In these, either of two 13-syllable metres are used, which are variants of each other (often both are used in the same poem). These metres are only used for ''rubaiyat''. A single long syllable may freely be substituted at the end of the verse where the pattern has \"u u\", and also sometimes in syllables 3 and 4:<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 134.</ref>\n:\u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 <u>u u</u> \u2013 : 3.3.13\n:\u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 | \u2013 <u>u u</u> \u2013 : 5.1.13\n\nThe rhyme scheme for a ''ruba'i'' is ''aa ba''; in this respect it resembles lyric poetry rather than a ''masnavi''.\n\nAs can be seen from the metrical patterns above, in Persian poetry, it is not possible to have more than two short syllables in a row. Unlike in Arabic poetry, ''anceps'' syllables (x) are not found in any place in the line except the beginning, where \u2013 u is commonly substituted for u u. The pattern \u2013 u u \u2013 u u \u2013, which is very common in Latin and Greek poetry, is never found in Persian. The final syllable of a line, whether theoretically short, long or overlong, always counts simply as long.\n\n==The traditional description==\n\nUntil recently Persian metres were always described using the same terms as in Arabic poetry, using the system known as ''[[Arabic prosody|\u02bfar\u016b\u1e0d]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0636}}, Persian pronunciation: '' 'ar\u016bz'') devised by the Arab grammarian [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|Al-Khalil]] in the 8th century AD. Thus for example the rhythm of [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Epic poetry|epic]] poem the [[Shahnameh]] (u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013) was thought to be a modification of the Arabic metre ''mutaq\u0101rib'', which is similar (u \u2013 x | u \u2013 x | u \u2013 x | u \u2013). (In this notation, u is used for a short syllable, \u2013 for a long one, and x for an ''anceps'', which may be either long or short.) Another possibility, however, since this metre was not used in Arabic until the Islamic period, is that it was borrowed from Persian into Arabic.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 172.</ref>\n\nSince Persian metres are generally different from Arabic ones, often the match between Arabic and Persian is not exact. Thus in the traditional system, both of the metres below are considered to be adaptations of the Arabic metre [[Hazaj meter|''hazaj'']] (u \u2013 \u2013 x | u \u2013 \u2013 x || u \u2013 \u2013 x | u \u2013 \u2013 x):\n:u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 (2.1.11)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 (5.1.10)\n\nAnother point is that the four most popular Arabic metres (the [[Tawil|''\u1e6daw\u012bl'']], [[Kamil (metre)|''k\u0101mil'']], [[wafir|''w\u0101fir'']] and [[basit|''bas\u012b\u1e6d'']]) are virtually never used in Persian,<ref name=DK7 /> while three of the basic Persian metres are not found in Arabic.<ref>Perry (1978), page 157.</ref> \n\nIn addition, one of the characteristics of Arabic poetry, namely the ''[[anceps]]'' positions (that is, certain places in the line where a syllable can be either long or short), do not apply to the Persian version of the Arabic metres. In Persian, except in certain metres where the first syllable only may be either long or short, the length of the syllables in any metre is either long or short but never variable.<ref>Maling (1973), p. 131.</ref>\n\n==A new approach==\nThe description of Persian metres was revolutionised with the publication in 1975 of an article in the journal ''Iran'' by [[Lawrence Paul Elwell-Sutton|L. P. Elwell-Sutton]],<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1975).</ref> later expanded into a book ''The Persian Metres'' (1976) and summarised in his entry '' \u02beAr\u016b\u017c'' (1986) in the ''Encyclopaedia Iranica''. Elwell-Sutton argued against the idea that Persian metres are simply an adaptation of Arabic ones, and on the whole his view has been accepted by subsequent scholars. As Fran\u00e7ois de Blois writes in ''Persian Literature: A Bio-Bibliographical Survey'':<ref name=DB49>De Blois (2002), p. 49.</ref> \"Many Persian metres, particularly those used in lyric poetry, do not correspond to any Arabic metre, this despite the fact that the traditional Persian prosodic theory has given them elaborate Arabic names and attempted to 'derive' them from the standard Arabic metres with which they share a name.\"\n\nWhat has been less readily accepted by other scholars is Elwell-Sutton's contention that the Persian metres as a whole carry on a tradition derived from pre-Islamic Persian poetry. According to De Blois there is no evidence that pre-Islamic poetry was quantitative rather than accentual. His view is that \"the pioneers of Persian poetry, besides borrowing, or rather adapting, some of the Arabic metres, also developed a number of new, purely Persian metres of an Arabic (i.e. quantitative) type.\"<ref name=DB49 />\n\n==Elwell-Sutton's classification==\nAfter examining the metres of over 20,000 Persian poems, Elwell-Sutton realised that the vast majority of them (well over 99%) could be analysed in terms of just five repeating patterns.<ref>Elwell-Sutton, article \u02beAruz in the ''Encyclopedia Iranica''.</ref> (Here the symbol u refers to a short syllable, and \u2013 to a long one.) \n:1. u \u2013 \u2013\n:2. u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n:3. u u \u2013 \u2013\n:4. u \u2013 u \u2013 u u \u2013 \u2013\n:5. \u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 u\n\nThus the metre u \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 , used in Ferdowsi's [[Shahnameh]], can be classified as the first pattern, starting on the first syllable, and 11 syllables long (1.1.11, in Elwell-Sutton's code); the metre \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 , used in [[Rumi]]'s [[Masnavi]], can be seen as a variety of the second pattern, starting on the fourth syllable instead of the first, and continuing for 11 lines (thus 2.4.11 in Elwell-Sutton's classification). The metre \u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 , used in [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nezami]]'s [[Layla and Majnun|Leyli o Majnun]], is classified as 5.1.10 (pattern 5, starting on syllable 1, 10 syllables long).\n\nThis system of labelling makes it possible to refer to the different metres in a simpler way than the traditional system, where the metre of [[Omar Khayyam]]'s quatrains is divided into 24 different patterns with labels such as ''hazaj-e musamman-e axrab-e maqb\u016bz-e makf\u016bf-e majb\u016bb''.<ref>Maling (1973), pp. 118-135.</ref>\n\nElwell-Sutton also calculated the frequency of occurrence of the various metres. He found that although over 100 different metres exist, 99% of classical Persian poems use one of a group of about 30 common metres, of which some are more frequent than others.\n\n==Rules of prosody==\n===Syllable length===\nTo \"[[scansion|scan]]\" a line of poetry is to establish which syllables are long and which are short so that it can be read properly. According to the European method, the line is first divided into syllables, each of which must contain a short vowel (''a, e, o''), a long vowel (''\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b'') or a diphthong (''ey, ow, \u0101y, \u016by''). A syllable must start with a consonant, if one is available, but not more than one. Thus {{lang|fa-Latn|goftan}} \"to say\" is divided {{lang|fa-Latn|gof-tan}} and {{lang|fa-Latn|'\u0101dam}} \"Adam\" is divided {{lang|fa-Latn|'\u0101-dam}}.\n\nSyllables in Persian poetry are of three lengths. Writing C for a consonant, V for a vowel, and VV for a long vowel or diphthong, the three lengths are as follows:\n*Short: CV, e.g. ''ke'', ''na''.\n*Long: CVV or CVC, e.g. ''n\u012b'', ''gof'', '' '\u0101'', ''mey''.\n*Overlong: CVVC, CVCC, CVVCC, e.g. ''k\u0101r'', ''dast'', ''d\u016bst''. (Exceptions: syllables ending in ''\u0101n'', ''\u012bn'', ''\u016bn'' usually count as long, not overlong.)<ref name=ES214>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 214; Thiesen (1982), pp. 39\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn Persian, the three lengths of syllable are referred to as {{lang|fa-Latn|k\u016bt\u0101h}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|boland}}, and {{lang|fa-Latn|der\u0101z}} respectively.<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 15.</ref>\n\nAt the end of a verse or half-line, the distinction between short, long, and overlong syllables is neutralised. Thus at the end of a line the syllables {{lang|fa-Latn|to}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|j\u0101}}, and {{lang|fa-Latn|d\u016bst}} are all counted as a single long syllable without distinction of length.<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 18.</ref>\n\n===Overlong syllables===\nAn overlong syllable can be substituted anywhere in a line where the metre has a long plus a short syllable (\u2013 u), and also at the beginning of the line where the metre has (x u).\n\nOverlong syllables not only add beauty to the line but also variety, since whenever an overlong syllable is used (except at line-end), the number of syllables is reduced.<ref>For discussion and statistics, see Elwell-Sutton (1976), pp. 126\u2013138.</ref> Thus in the first half of the following couplet from Saadi's ''[[Gulistan (book)|Golest\u0101n]]'', the metre (4.5.11), which normally has eleven syllables, is reduced to eight. In the second line, there are 9 syllables, because in addition to the overlong syllable in {{lang|fa-Latn|d\u016bst\u012b}}, the final u u \u2013 of the line is replaced by \u2013 \u2013. The overlong syllables are underlined in the transliteration:\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u067e\u0627\u064a\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u064a \u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0634\u0627\u064a\u062f \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u063a\u062f\u0627\u0631}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|y\u0101r-e n\u0101<u>p\u0101yd\u0101r</u> <u>d\u016bst</u> mad\u0101r}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>d\u016bs</u>t\u012b-r\u0101 na-\u0161\u0101yad \u012bn qadd\u0101r}}\n\n:\u2013 u \u2013 \u2013u \u2013u \u2013u u \u2013\n:\u2013u \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\n:\"Do not love a friend who is not steadfast;\n:this traitor is not worthy of friendship.\"\n\nWhen Persian poetry is recited, the three lengths of syllable, \"short\", \"long\", and \"overlong\" take different lengths of time to say. In an experiment, L. P. Elwell-Sutton recorded two well-educated Persian speakers reading a number of poems and measured the length of each syllable in hundredths of a second. Although the length of the syllables was variable (for example, a short syllable could be anything from 0.07 to 0.65 seconds), the average of the two speakers combined was as follows: short syllables 0.21 seconds, long syllables 0.33 seconds, overlong syllables 0.59 seconds.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 207.</ref>\n\nIn the traditional Turkish and Indian method of pronouncing Persian poetry, an overlong syllable is followed by a short anaptyctic vowel, known as {{lang|fa-Latn|n\u012bm-fathe}} (\"half-'a'\"), (for example, {{lang|fa-Latn|d\u016bs<sup>a</sup>t\u012b}} \"friendship\"), but in Iran this vowel is not usually used.<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 16.</ref> However, there are a few words, such as {{lang|fa-Latn|\u0101s(e)m\u0101n}} \"heaven\", where both pronunciations are allowed in dictionaries.\n\n===Minor rules of prosody===\n===='''Eyn'' and ''alef''====\nThe letter '' 'eyn'' (\u0639), which is pronounced as a [[glottal stop]] in Persian, is always counted in poetry as a consonant, e.g. '' 'e\u0161q'' {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0639\u0634\u0642}} \"love\".<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 22.</ref> Thus like any other consonant it can cause the previous syllable to become long, so that {{lang|fa|rtl=yes| \u0627\u0632\u0639\u0634\u0642}} ''az 'e\u0161q'' \"from love\" has the scansion \u2013 \u2013u.\n\nThe letter alef (\u0627) at the beginning of a word, on the other hand, can either be pronounced as a glottal stop, or ignored in scansion. Thus in Hafez's line beginning {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u06a9 \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0632\u06cc}} ''agar '\u0101n Tork-e \u0160\u012br\u0101z\u012b'' \"if that Shirazi Turk\", the glottal stop at the beginning of the word {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0622\u0646}} '' '\u0101n'' \"that\" is pronounced and the scansion is u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013\u00a0\u2013. But in most cases the alef is silent and has no effect on the length of the previous syllable. Different poets have different preferences in this; for example, verses where the alef is observed as a glottal stop are much more common in Rumi than in Sa'di.<ref>Heny (1981), pp. 88-89; Thiesen (1982), p. 21.</ref> The word {{lang|fa-Latn|ast}} \"is\" and other parts of the verb \"to be\" are always pronounced without a glottal stop; and there is also no glottal stop after a verbal prefix, for example {{lang|fa-Latn|bar-\u0101mad}} \"came up\".<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 20.</ref>\n\n====''Ez\u0101fe'' and final vowels====\nThe unwritten ''ez\u0101fe'' suffix (as in {{lang|fa-Latn|Tork-e \u0160\u012br\u0101z\u012b}} \"Shirazi Turk\") may be pronounced either long or short (''-e'' or ''-\u0113''), as the metre requires, and the word {{lang|fa-Latn|o}} \"and\" similarly may be either ''o'' or ''\u014d''. \n\nWords ending in short vowels, such as {{lang|fa-Latn|na}} \"neither\", {{lang|fa-Latn|to}} \"you\", {{lang|fa-Latn|x\u0101ne}} \"house\", can also have the final vowel lengthened where convenient.<ref>Heny (1981), pp. 143-145.</ref><ref>Thiesen (1982), pp. 23\u201327.</ref> When lengthened, these vowels do not change their quality, so that {{lang|fa-Latn|na}} is pronounced [n\u00e6:] rather than [n\u0251:].<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 9.</ref>\n\nWhen the sound ''\u012b'' (written \u06cc) is followed directly by another vowel in Persian words, as in {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u06cc\u0627}} {{lang|fa-Latn|biy\u0101}} \"come\", it is pronounced short, and similarly with the sounds ''ey'' and ''ow'' when they are followed by a vowel; for example {{lang|fa-Latn|'''mey'''-\u0113 b\u0101q\u012b}} \"the remaining wine\", {{lang|fa-Latn|be\u0161'''now''' az ney}} \"listen to the flute\", {{lang|fa-Latn|b\u012b'''ni''' \u0101n Tork}} \"do you see that Turk?\", where {{lang|fa-Latn|mey}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|now}}, and {{lang|fa-Latn|-ni}} are all short syllables, as required by the metre. However, the prefixes ''b\u012b-'' \"without\" and ''m\u012b-'' (the prefix making continuous tenses) are never shortened.<ref>Heny (1981), p. 95.</ref>\n\n====Alternative pronunciations====\nDifferent pronunciations of other words can also be used where convenient, for example, the word for \"from\" can be {{lang|fa-Latn|'az}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|az}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|ze}} or ''z-''; \"if\" can be {{lang|fa-Latn|agar}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|gar}} or {{lang|fa-Latn|ar}}; \"hungry\" can be {{lang|fa-Latn|gorsne}} or {{lang|fa-Latn|gorosne}}, and so on. The words {{lang|fa-Latn|va}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|ze}}, and {{lang|fa-Latn|ke}} (\"who\", \"that\", \"since\") are often joined on to the next word, e.g. {{lang|fa-Latn|v-agar}} \"and if\", {{lang|fa-Latn|z-\u012bn}} \"from this\", {{lang|fa-Latn|k-az}} \"since from\".<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), pp. 215-6.</ref>\n\nIn some words, a long vowel can be shortened (e.g. {{lang|fa-Latn|gon\u0101h}} \"sin\" can become {{lang|fa-Latn|gonah}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|d\u012bgar}} \"other\" can become {{lang|fa-Latn|degar}}). When this happens, the vowel quality changes.<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 62.</ref>\n\n====Silent ''v\u0101v''====\nThe silent letter ''v\u0101v'' (\u0648) which sometimes follows the letter ''xe'' (\u062e) in Persian words (e.g. {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0628}} {{lang|fa-Latn|x(w)\u0101b}} \"sleep\") is ignored in scansion.\n\n====Arabic words====\nLines of Arabic are sometimes included in Persian poems. The Arabic is pronounced with Persian phonology (for example, \u0636 and \u0638 are both pronounced ''z''), and unless the whole poem is Arabic, the metre is Persian.<ref>Thiesen (1982), pp. 69\u201372.</ref>\n\n== Word accent and metre ==\nThe word accent in Persian (which is pronounced as a combination of high pitch and stress)<ref>Hosseini, Seyed Ayat (2014), p. 22f for a review of the literature; also p. 35.</ref> at first sight does not affect the metre. In the following couplet of [[Hafez|H\u0101fez]], for example, although the two verses are parallel in structure, the word accent (which generally is heard on the last syllable of each word) comes three times on short syllables in the first verse, but three times on long syllables in the second verse. The accent is shown here by transcribing the accented vowels in '''bold''':\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0632\u0644\u0641 \u0622\u0634\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0628 \u0648 \u0645\u0633\u062a}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u067e\u06cc\u0631\u0647\u0646 \u0686\u0627\u06a9 \u0648 \u063a\u0632\u0644 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0635\u0631\u0627\u062d\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0633\u062a}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>zolf</u>-'\u0101\u0161oft'''e'''-vo xoy-kard'''e'''-vo xand\u0101n-l'''a'''b-o <u>m'''a'''st</u>}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>p\u012br</u>han-\u010d'''\u0101'''k-o qazal-x'''\u0101'''n-o sor\u0101h'''\u012b''' dar <u>d'''a'''st</u>}}\n\n:x u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013\n\n:\"Hair-tousled, perspiring, smiling-lipped, and drunk,\n:shirt torn, singing songs, and wine-flask in hand\"\n\nHowever, the word accent cannot be entirely disregarded. In metres with the rhythms | u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | or | \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 |, there is a clear tendency for the word-accent to be on the 2nd and 4th syllables of the feet. The possibility remains that each metre has a \"natural\" pattern of stress, which is deviated from deliberately to create interest and tension.<ref>For discussion see Heny (1981), pp. 281-341.</ref>\n\n==Division into feet==\nThe Arabic prosodists divide the lines of verse up into \"[[foot (prosody)|feet]]\" or \"prosodic words\"<ref>Farzaad (1967)</ref> ({{lang|ar-Latn|rukn}} or {{lang|ar-Latn|rokn}}, pl. {{lang|ar-Latn|ark\u0101n}}) of three to five syllables each; thus the metre of the Shahnameh is divided as | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 |, pronounced as {{lang|ar-Latn|fa'\u016blun fa'\u016blun fa'\u016blun fa'\u016bl}}, using made up words derived from the Arabic verb {{lang|ar|rtl=yes|\u0641\u0639\u0644}} {{lang|fa-Latn|f\u02bel}} \"to do\".

However, sometimes such breaks are found elsewhere, one common place being after the eleventh syllable in the above metre.<ref>Heny (1981), p. 208.</ref> Different poets differ in their style. In the above metre, a sentence-break at the mid-point of the line is particularly common in Rumi, being found in 75% of the lines examined in a study by Jeannine Heny, whereas in Saadi it came at this place in only 25% of the lines.\n\n===Type of feet===\nWhere the division into feet is uncontroversial, the preference is usually for feet which end in a heavy syllable. Thus in the second pattern, the feet u \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0, \u2013\u00a0u \u2013 \u2013 , \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 exist, but \u2013 \u2013\u00a0\u2013 u is not found. There is also a preference for feet of four syllables, rather than three or five; thus the ''k\u0101mil'' metre (common in Arabic) with its repeated five-syllable foot of u u \u2013 u \u2013 does not easily fit into the Persian metrical system and is almost never found.\n\n===The ''ruba'i''===\nAlthough the division into feet is often clear, in other cases, especially with the compound metres of patterns 4 and 5, it is less obvious. Elwell-Sutton therefore left the metres undivided. For example, the traditional foot division for the ''ruba'i'' metre (5.1.13) is as follows:<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 55.</ref>\n:| \u2013 \u2013 u | u \u2013 u \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 u | u \u2013 |\n\nThe phonologist [[Bruce Hayes (linguist)|Bruce Hayes]] proposed dividing it as follows:<ref>Hayes (1979), p. 217.</ref>\n:| \u2013 \u2013 u u | \u2013 u \u2013 u | \u2013 \u2013 u u | \u2013 |\n\nBut Masoud Farzaad,<ref>Farzaad (1967), p. 113.</ref><ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farzad Farz\u0101d, Mas'\u016bd], ''Encyclopaedia Iranica''.</ref> followed by Thiesen,<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 167.</ref> divided it as follows:\n:| \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 || u \u2013 u \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 |\n\nThis seems better to fit the way a ''ruba'i'' is actually composed, since there is often a phrase-break (or potential pause) at the point that Farzaad marks with ||. He refers to this point as the \"hinge\" of the line.<ref>Farzaad (1967), p. 58.</ref>\n\nIn the ''ruba'i'' the rhythm after the \"hinge\" can be either \u2013 u or u \u2013. The same choice is sometimes found in early poets in the metre 3.4.7(2) in the same way after the break:<ref>Thiesen (1982), pp. 100, 153.</ref>\n:| x x u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 || x x u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 |\n\n===''Biceps'' elements===\n{{see|Biceps (prosody)}}\nIn metres where a line ends with the sequence u u \u2013, as in the above ''ruba'i'' metre, the two short syllables are often replaced with a single long syllable.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), pp. 126\u2013137.</ref> This replacement is also found in the first half of the line, but much less commonly. In a sample of 200 lines taken from the ''ruba'i'' metres, Elwell-Sutton found that the final u u \u2013 became \u2013 \u2013 in 50% of lines, the first u u \u2013 became \u2013 \u2013 in 5% of lines, and for the middle u u \u2013 there were no examples.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 134.</ref>\n\nWhen the rhythm u u \u2013 is replaced by \u2013 \u2013 in the first half of the line, there is usually a phrase boundary or potential pause after the second long syllable.<ref>For discussion see Heny (1981), pp. 116-135.</ref> The following line from a ''ruba'i'' is typical:\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|goft\u0101, \u0161eyx\u0101,}} || {{lang|fa-Latn|har \u0101n\u010de g\u016b'\u012b hastam}}\n: \u2013 | \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 || u \u2013 u \u2013 | \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 |\n:She said, o Sheikh! I am what you say I am.\n\nThe ''biceps'' ending \u2013 <u>u u</u> \u2013 is also sometimes found in Arabic poetry, in the [[basit|bas\u012b\u1e6d]] metre, for example in poems written by the poet [[Abu Nuwas]], who was of half-Persian origin.\n\n==Rhyme==\nPersian poems always use rhyme, and from the point of view of rhyme can be classified into various types: \n\n*Poems in rhyming couplets, each couplet with a different rhyme, thus with the scheme ''aa bb cc ...''. A poem of this type is known as a ''[[Mathnawi (poetic form)|masnavi]]'' (plural ''masnav\u012by\u0101t''). The poems in rhyming couplets can be of any length from a single couplet to long poems such as [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahnameh]], which is over 50,000 couplets long, or [[Rumi]]'s [[Masnavi|Masnavi-ye Ma'navi]] \"Spiritual Masnavi\", of over 25,000 couplets.\n\n*Lyric poems, in which, apart from the first line, the two halves of each verse do not rhyme, but the same rhyme is used at the end of every verse throughout the poem, thus ''aa ba ca ...''. Among lyric poems with a single rhyme throughout, the two most common forms are the [[ghazal]] (a short poem usually about love) and the [[qasida]] (which is longer, and may be over 100 verses). The short [[ruba'i]] (quatrain) and [[do-bayti]], which usually have the rhyme scheme ''aa ba'', also belong to this type.\n\n*[[stanza|Stanzaic]] poems, which have rhyme schemes such as ''aaabb, cccbb, dddbb'' and so on.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1975), pp. 93\u201394.</ref> Stanzaic poems first seem to have been introduced in the 11th century by such poets as [[Farrukhi Sistani|Farrokhi]] and [[Manuchehri]].<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1975), p. 93.</ref>\n\n*Very short poems (typically of two lines) which are included in works such as Saadi's [[Gulistan (book)|Golestan]]. In these, the rhyme-scheme ''ab cb'' is typical, but ''ab ab'', ''aa bb'', and ''aa aa'' are also found.\n\nPersian rhymes often consist of a single syllable, for example ''m\u0101h / siy\u0101h''; but there are also plenty of instances of longer rhymes, such ''s\u0101zande / nav\u0101zande'' or ''p\u016byandag\u0101n / g\u016byandag\u0101n''.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1975), p. 89.</ref> Following the actual rhyming word there may be a ''rad\u012bf'', which is a word or series of words that is repeated after every rhyme, for example ''\u0161ek\u0101yat m\u012bkonad / hek\u0101yat m\u012bkonad'' (Rumi). As well as the main rhyme, there may also be additional internal rhymes in a verse.\n\nPersian rhyme sometimes provides evidence of an earlier pronunciation of the language. For example, in Saadi's poem \"Cloud and wind\" quoted below, the word ''naxor\u012b'' rhymes with ''nabar\u012b'', presumably because in Saadi's day, at least in poetry, the first word was pronounced ''naxwar\u012b''.<ref>Dictionaries of Middle Persian give the word for \"to eat\" as ''xvartan'' or ''xwardan'' (wiktionary: {{wikt-lang|fa|\u062e\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0646}}); cf. Elwell-Sutton (1975), p. 89.</ref>\n\nA feature of classical Persian pronunciation which is no longer observed in Iran today is the distinction between long ''\u014d'' and ''\u016b'', and between ''\u0113'' and ''\u012b''; for example, {{lang|fa-Latn|\u0161\u0113r}} \"lion\" vs. {{lang|fa-Latn|\u0161\u012br}} \"milk\".<ref>Thiesen (1982), pp. 3\u20134.</ref> These days both ''\u014d'' and ''\u016b'' are pronounced ''\u016b'', and ''\u0113'' and ''\u012b'' are pronounced ''\u012b''; in classical times the indefinite article suffix ''-\u0113'' did not rhyme with ''-\u012b'' \"you are\".<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 74.</ref> However, the original pronunciation of these vowels can still be heard in eastern traditions, such as those of Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and India. (See [[Persian phonology]].)\n\n==A table of common metres==\nThe list of metres below is based on the one in Elwell-Sutton's ''The Persian Metres''.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1986), table 21.</ref> The patterns are read from left to right. u = short syllable; \u2013 = long syllable; x = either long or short. \u2013 u or x u may be replaced by an overlong syllable (\u2013u); an overlong syllable may also replace the final syllable of any verse.\n\nThe sign (M) after a metre indicates one of the seven metres traditionally used in ''[[masnavi (poetic form)|masnaviyat]]'' (long poems in rhyming couplets such as Ferdowsi's [[Shahnameh]] or Rumi's mystical [[Masnavi]]).<ref>Hayes (1979), p. 212.</ref> Except for one metre in 10 syllables, all the ''masnavi'' metres have 11 syllables, a feature that may date to pre-Islamic times, since 11-syllable metre seems to have been common at that time.\n\nThe sign (R) indicates one of the two metres used in making ''[[Ruba'i|rub\u0101'iy\u0101t]]'' (quatrains). These two metres (5.1.13 and 3.3.13), which are really variations of the same metre, are used only for ''rub\u0101'iy\u0101t''. Very similar to the ''ruba'i'' is the ''[[do-bayt\u012b]]'', which uses the metre 5.1.11.\n\nThe frequency column shows the percentage of lyric poems in each metre, out of a sample of over 20,000 poems, as counted by L. D. Elwell-Sutton.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 162.</ref> Since this covers only lyric poems, it omits ''masnav\u012by\u0101t'' and ''rob\u0101'\u012by\u0101t''.\n\nFor lyric poems, the metres of pattern 4 (43.8%) are the most common, followed by pattern 2 (27.6%) and pattern 3 (19.7%). Pattern 5 (5.4%) and pattern 1 (3.3%) are less frequently used, and metres in patterns other than the normal five are used in only 0.2% of the poems Elwell-Sutton examined.<ref name=\"Elwell-Sutton 1976, p. 162\">Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 162.</ref>\n\nThe traditional Arabic names are given in their Persian pronunciation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

An example is 3.4.11:\n:| \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 |\n\nThe metre 3.4.07(2), which has a pause internally, is catalectic in both halves of the line:\n:| \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 || \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 |\n\nThis can be compared with the full version of the same metre, 3.4.16:\n:| \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 |\n\nThe commonly used ''mojtass'' metre (4.1.15) is another catalectic metre, since it is made up of two sections, 8 and 7 syllables long, often with a break between:\n:| u \u2013 u \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 || u \u2013 u \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 |\n\nIt has been argued that metres can be shortened at the beginning as well as at the end of the line.<ref>Farzaad (1967), pp. 58\u201364.</ref> For example, the ''khaf\u012bf'' metre (4.5.11) is simply the ''mojtass'' (4.1.15) with the first foot removed:\n:| x u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 |\n\n==Examples of the metres from Persian poets==\nIn the section below, examples are given of some well known poems in various of the above metres.

Contrary to the practice in other metres which start with a double short, in this metre the initial pair of short syllables (u u) is never replaced by long-short (\u2013 u).<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 137.</ref> The metre can be analysed as 5.1.10 without the first two syllables, doubled.

In exactly the same way, metricians have suggested that the anacreontic may be derived by anaclasis from an ionic dimeter (u u \u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 \u2013).<ref>M. L. West, ''Greek Metre'' (Oxford: OUP, 1982), p. 31.</ref>\n\n====\"Tonight you are ours!\"====\nThe same doubled metre 5.3.08(2) is used in a poem by Saadi's contemporary, Rumi:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/moulavi/shams/ghazalsh/sh2839/ Rumi, Divan-e Shams, ghazal 2839.]</ref>\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u06a9\u0634\u06cc\u062f \u06cc\u0627\u0631 \u06af\u0648\u0634\u0645 * \u06a9\u0647 \u062a\u0648 \u0627\u0645\u0634\u0628 \u0622\u0646 \u0645\u0627\u06cc\u06cc}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0635\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0644\u06cc \u0648\u0644\u06cc\u06a9\u0646 * \u062a\u0648 \u0646\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u062f\u0647 \u06a9\u062c\u0627\u06cc\u06cc}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|beke<u>\u0161\u012bd</u> <u>y\u0101r</u> g\u016b\u0161-am * ke to em\u0161ab \u0101n-e m\u0101-\u012b}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|sanam\u0101! bal\u012b va-l\u012bkan * to ne\u0161\u0101n bedeh koj\u0101-\u012b}}\n\n:| u u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 || u u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 |\n\n:\"My beloved pulled my ear, saying 'Tonight you are ours'!\n:\"My idol!

It is also unusual in that this combined metre is only used for {{lang|fa-Latn|rob\u0101'\u012by\u0101t}} and not for other types of poem. In fact the two metres are the same except that the 6th and 7th syllables are reversed. The rhythm is therefore the following:\n\n: \u2013 | \u2013 <u>u u</u> \u2013 || u \u2013 u \u2013 | \u2013\u00a0<u>u u</u> \u2013 | or\n: \u2013 | \u2013 <u>u u</u> \u2013 || \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013\u00a0<u>u u</u> \u2013 |\n\nThe foot divisions are those suggested by Farzaad.<ref>Farzaad (1967), p. 113; cf. Thiesen (1982), p. 167.</ref> At the point marked ||, which Farzaad calls the \"hinge\" of the line, in some kinds of traditional recitation there is often a pause.<ref>See External links, Tajik girls.</ref><ref>cf. also Heny (1981).</ref>\n\nThe metre 5.1.13 is more common than 3.3.13; in an extensive survey of quatrains by Khayyam and Hafez, Farzaad found 70% of lines were in 5.1.13.<ref>Farzaad (1942), p. 70.</ref><ref>See Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 135 for statistics; in his slightly smaller survey he found 60% were in 5.1.13.</ref> 21% of 100 quatrains examined by Elwell-Sutton were entirely in 5.1.13, but only 8% entirely in 3.3.13. The rest were mixed. \n\nThe ending u u \u2013 is changed to \u2013 \u2013 in nearly half of all verses. Substitution of \u2013 for u u in syllables 3 and 4 is much less common; it occurs in only 5% of lines according to Farzaad.<ref>Farzaad (1942), p. 68.</ref><ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 134.</ref> (In theory the substitution of \u2013 for u u may also occur in syllables 7 and 8, but this is exceedingly rare.)

The following poem, for example, by the 18th-century poet [[Hatef Esfahani]], is written in the ''[[Kamil (metre)|k\u0101mil]]'' metre, rare in Persian but common in Arabic.

Until the advent of free verse in the 20th century, this poetry was always quantitative\u2014that is the lines were composed in various patterns of long and short syllables. The different patterns are known as metres (US: meters). A knowledge of metre is essential for someone to correctly recite Persian poetry\u2014and also often, since short vowels are not written in Persian script, to convey the correct meaning in cases of ambiguity. It is also helpful for those who memorise the verse.\n\nMetres in Persian have traditionally been analysed in terms of Arabic metres, from which they are supposed to have been adapted. However, in recent years it has been recognised that for the most part Persian metres developed independently from those in Arabic, and there has been a movement to analyse them on their own terms.\n\nAn unusual feature of Persian poetry not found in Arabic, Latin, or Ancient Greek verse is that instead of two lengths of syllables (short and long), there are three lengths (short, long, and overlong). Overlong syllables can be used instead of a long syllable plus a short one.\n\nPersian metres were used not only in classical Persian poetry, but were also imitated in Turkish poetry of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period,<ref>Deo & Kiparsky (2011), p. 7.</ref> and in Urdu poetry under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors.<ref>See external links (Pritchett).</ref> That the poets of Turkey and India copied Persian metres, not Arabic ones, is clear from the fact that, just as with Persian verse, the most commonly used metres of Arabic poetry (the [[Tawil|''\u1e6daw\u012bl'']], [[Kamil (metre)|''k\u0101mil'']], [[wafir|''w\u0101fir'']] and [[basit|''bas\u012b\u1e6d'']]) are avoided, while those metres used most frequently in Persian lyric poetry are exactly those most frequent in Turkish and Urdu.<ref name=DK7>Deo & Kiparsky, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Quantitative verse==\nClassical Persian poetry is based not on stress but on quantity, that is, on the length of syllables. A syllable ending in a short vowel is short (u), but one ending in a long vowel or a consonant is long (\u2013). Thus a word like ''ja-h\u0101n'' \"world\" is considered to have a short syllable plus a long one (u \u2013), whereas ''far-d\u0101'' \"tomorrow\" consists of two long syllables (\u2013 \u2013). A word like ''na-fas'' \"breath\" is usually considered to have a short syllable plus a long one (u \u2013), but if a vowel follows, as in ''na-fa-s\u012b'' \"a breath\", the second syllable is short (u u \u2013).\n\nA characteristic feature of classical Persian verse is that in addition to long and short syllables, it also has \"overlong\" syllables. These are syllables consisting of any vowel + two consonants, such as {{lang|fa-Latn|panj}} \"five\" or {{lang|fa-Latn|d\u016bst}} \"friend\", or a long vowel + one consonant (other than ''n''), for example {{lang|fa-Latn|r\u016bz}} \"day\" or {{lang|fa-Latn|b\u0101d}} \"wind\". In the metre of a poem, an overlong syllable can take the place of any sequence of \"long + short\". They can also be used at the end of a line, in which case the difference between long and overlong is neutralised.\n\nIn modern colloquial pronunciation, the difference in length between long and short vowels is mostly not observed (see [[Persian phonology]]), but when reciting poetry the long vowels are pronounced longer than the short ones.<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 5.</ref> When a recording of Persian verse is analysed, it can be seen that long syllables are on average pronounced longer than short ones, and overlong syllables are longer still (see below for details).\n\nIn this article, the following scansion symbols are used:\n*u = a short syllable\n*\u2013 = a long syllable\n*\u2013u = an overlong syllable\n*x = ''[[anceps]]'', that is: some metres allow either a long or short syllable at the beginning of a line.\n*<u>u u</u> = ''[[Biceps (prosody)|biceps]]'', that is, a pair of short syllables that can be freely replaced by one long syllable. Mainly this occurs when a line ends in u&nbsp;u&nbsp;\u2013, rarely elsewhere.\n\n==Metrical patterns==\nFrom a metrical point of view, classical Persian poetry can be divided into three types. \n\n===Masnavi===\nThe first type is poems in rhyming couplets, known as [[Mathnawi|''masnavi'']] (plural {{lang|fa-Latn|masnav\u012by\u0101t}}).<ref>The word is derived from the Arabic word for \"two\", {{lang|ar-Latn|i\u03b8n\u0101n}}: Thiesen (1982), p. 78.</ref> These are almost always written in one of seven different metres consisting of 11 (or in one case of 10) syllables, and each couplet has its own separate rhyme. The 11-syllable tradition may go back to pre-Islamic times, since 11-syllable poetry seems to have been common at that time.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1975), p. 91.</ref>\n\nSome of the poems written in the ''masnavi'' form are very long, of up to 50,000 couplets. The most common of the metres used are the following (Elwell-Sutton's code follows each metre):\n:u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 (e.g. Ferdowsi's ''[[Shahnameh]]'' or Saadi's ''[[Bustan (book)|Bustan]]''): 1.1.11\n:u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 (e.g. Gorgani's ''[[Vis and Ramin]]'' or Nezami's ''[[Khosrow and Shirin]]''): 2.1.11\n:\u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 (e.g. Rumi's ''[[Masnavi|Masnavi-\u0113 Ma'nav\u012b]]'' or Attar's ''[[The Conference of the Birds|Conference of the Birds]]''): 2.4.11\n:\u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 (e.g. Nezami's ''[[Layla and Majnun|Leyli and Majnun]]''): 5.1.10<ref>The feet are unclear; cf. Farzaad (1967), p. 60; Hayes (1979), p. 214.</ref>\n:x u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 (e.g. [[Sanai]]'s ''Had\u012bqatu-l-Haq\u012bqa'' or Nezami's ''[[Haft Peykar|Seven Portraits]]''): 4.5.11\n\nSome shorter poems also, such as many of those in [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]]'s ''[[Gulistan (book)|Golest\u0101n]]'', are also written in rhyming couplets in one or another of these metres, a famous example being ''[[Bani Adam|Ban\u012b \u0100dam]]'' from the ''Golest\u0101n'', which consists of three rhyming couplets in the first of the above metres.\n\nThe 12th-century poet [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nezami]] famously wrote a set of 5 ''masnav\u012by\u0101t'', each in a different one of the above metres, totalling nearly 29,000 couplets in all.<ref>Parrello, Domenico (2000/2010). [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kamsa-of-nezami \"\u1e34amsa of Ne\u1e93\u0101m\u012b\"]. ''Encyclopaedia Iranica online''.</ref> Such a quintet was known as a ''khamsa'' or ''khamse'' (from the Arabic {{lang|ar|\u062e\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0629}} ''xamsa'' \"(group of) five\"), and the practice was later imitated by other poets such as [[Amir Khusrau|Amir Khosrow]] of Delhi and [[Khwaju Kermani]] of Shiraz.\n\n===Lyric poetry===\nThe second type of Persian poetry is lyric poetry, such as the [[ghazal]]s of [[Hafez]], or the spiritual poems in [[Rumi]]'s collection known as the [[Diwan-e Shams-e Tabrizi]]. These tend to be in longer metres, usually of 14 to 16 syllables long, in [[tetrameter]] form (i.e. with four feet in each [[hemistich]] or half-verse).\n\nAbout 30 different metres are commonly used for lyric poems, but 70% of the poems are written in one of the following seven metres:<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976) ''The Persian Metres'', p. 162.</ref>\n:u \u2013 u \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 (15 syllables): 4.1.15\n:\u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 (14 syllables): 4.7.14\n:\u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 (15 syllables): 2.4.15\n:x u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 (15 syllables): 3.1.15\n:x u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 (11 syllables): 4.5.11\n:u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 (16 syllables): 2.1.16\n:\u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 (14 syllables): 3.3.14\n\nThe shorter metre 4.5.11 is frequently used for ''masnav\u012by\u0101t'', but can also be used for lyric writing, such as in eight of Hafez's ghazals.<ref>Nos. 13, 42, 56, 262, 270, 302, 381, 453; Thiesen (1982), p. 150.</ref> \n\nOccasionally a metre is made up of two short sections, the second a repetition of the first, such as the following:\n:\u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 || \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 (7 + 7 syllables): 3.4.7(2) = 4.4.7(2)\n\nThe majority of lyric poetry is composed in the form of couplets, in which the first couplet is rhyming couplet, and then the same rhyme is used at the end of every couplet until the end of the poem. A minority of lyric poetry is composed in stanzas with more complicated rhyme schemes.\n\nBoth in ''masnav\u012by\u0101t'' and in lyric poems the same metre is used in every line, the only variation being the occasional substitution of an overlong syllable for \"long + short\", and sometimes (especially near the end of a line) the substitution of a single long syllable for two short ones. Another source of variety is the word accent, which changes from line to line, thus avoiding monotony.\n\n===Ruba'i===\nThe third type of poetry is the [[ruba'i]] or quatrain, such as the ''rubaiyat'' of [[Omar Khayyam]]. In these, either of two 13-syllable metres are used, which are variants of each other (often both are used in the same poem). These metres are only used for ''rubaiyat''. A single long syllable may freely be substituted at the end of the verse where the pattern has \"u u\", and also sometimes in syllables 3 and 4:<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 134.</ref>\n:\u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 <u>u u</u> \u2013 : 3.3.13\n:\u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 | \u2013 <u>u u</u> \u2013 : 5.1.13\n\nThe rhyme scheme for a ''ruba'i'' is ''aa ba''; in this respect it resembles lyric poetry rather than a ''masnavi''.\n\nAs can be seen from the metrical patterns above, in Persian poetry, it is not possible to have more than two short syllables in a row. Unlike in Arabic poetry, ''anceps'' syllables (x) are not found in any place in the line except the beginning, where \u2013 u is commonly substituted for u u. The pattern \u2013 u u \u2013 u u \u2013, which is very common in Latin and Greek poetry, is never found in Persian. The final syllable of a line, whether theoretically short, long or overlong, always counts simply as long.\n\n==The traditional description==\n\nUntil recently Persian metres were always described using the same terms as in Arabic poetry, using the system known as ''[[Arabic prosody|\u02bfar\u016b\u1e0d]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0636}}, Persian pronunciation: '' 'ar\u016bz'') devised by the Arab grammarian [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|Al-Khalil]] in the 8th century AD. Thus for example the rhythm of [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Epic poetry|epic]] poem the [[Shahnameh]] (u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013) was thought to be a modification of the Arabic metre ''mutaq\u0101rib'', which is similar (u \u2013 x | u \u2013 x | u \u2013 x | u \u2013). (In this notation, u is used for a short syllable, \u2013 for a long one, and x for an ''anceps'', which may be either long or short.) Another possibility, however, since this metre was not used in Arabic until the Islamic period, is that it was borrowed from Persian into Arabic.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 172.</ref>\n\nSince Persian metres are generally different from Arabic ones, often the match between Arabic and Persian is not exact. Thus in the traditional system, both of the metres below are considered to be adaptations of the Arabic metre [[Hazaj meter|''hazaj'']] (u \u2013 \u2013 x | u \u2013 \u2013 x || u \u2013 \u2013 x | u \u2013 \u2013 x):\n:u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 (2.1.11)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 (5.1.10)\n\nAnother point is that the four most popular Arabic metres (the [[Tawil|''\u1e6daw\u012bl'']], [[Kamil (metre)|''k\u0101mil'']], [[wafir|''w\u0101fir'']] and [[basit|''bas\u012b\u1e6d'']]) are virtually never used in Persian,<ref name=DK7 /> while three of the basic Persian metres are not found in Arabic.<ref>Perry (1978), page 157.</ref> \n\nIn addition, one of the characteristics of Arabic poetry, namely the ''[[anceps]]'' positions (that is, certain places in the line where a syllable can be either long or short), do not apply to the Persian version of the Arabic metres. In Persian, except in certain metres where the first syllable only may be either long or short, the length of the syllables in any metre is either long or short but never variable.<ref>Maling (1973), p. 131.</ref>\n\n==A new approach==\nThe description of Persian metres was revolutionised with the publication in 1975 of an article in the journal ''Iran'' by [[Lawrence Paul Elwell-Sutton|L. P. Elwell-Sutton]],<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1975).</ref> later expanded into a book ''The Persian Metres'' (1976) and summarised in his entry '' \u02beAr\u016b\u017c'' (1986) in the ''Encyclopaedia Iranica''. Elwell-Sutton argued against the idea that Persian metres are simply an adaptation of Arabic ones, and on the whole his view has been accepted by subsequent scholars. As Fran\u00e7ois de Blois writes in ''Persian Literature: A Bio-Bibliographical Survey'':<ref name=DB49>De Blois (2002), p. 49.</ref> \"Many Persian metres, particularly those used in lyric poetry, do not correspond to any Arabic metre, this despite the fact that the traditional Persian prosodic theory has given them elaborate Arabic names and attempted to 'derive' them from the standard Arabic metres with which they share a name.\"\n\nWhat has been less readily accepted by other scholars is Elwell-Sutton's contention that the Persian metres as a whole carry on a tradition derived from pre-Islamic Persian poetry. According to De Blois there is no evidence that pre-Islamic poetry was quantitative rather than accentual. His view is that \"the pioneers of Persian poetry, besides borrowing, or rather adapting, some of the Arabic metres, also developed a number of new, purely Persian metres of an Arabic (i.e. quantitative) type.\"<ref name=DB49 />\n\n==Elwell-Sutton's classification==\nAfter examining the metres of over 20,000 Persian poems, Elwell-Sutton realised that the vast majority of them (well over 99%) could be analysed in terms of just five repeating patterns.<ref>Elwell-Sutton, article \u02beAruz in the ''Encyclopedia Iranica''.</ref> (Here the symbol u refers to a short syllable, and \u2013 to a long one.) \n:1. u \u2013 \u2013\n:2. u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n:3. u u \u2013 \u2013\n:4. u \u2013 u \u2013 u u \u2013 \u2013\n:5. \u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 u\n\nThus the metre u \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 , used in Ferdowsi's [[Shahnameh]], can be classified as the first pattern, starting on the first syllable, and 11 syllables long (1.1.11, in Elwell-Sutton's code); the metre \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 , used in [[Rumi]]'s [[Masnavi]], can be seen as a variety of the second pattern, starting on the fourth syllable instead of the first, and continuing for 11 lines (thus 2.4.11 in Elwell-Sutton's classification). The metre \u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 , used in [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nezami]]'s [[Layla and Majnun|Leyli o Majnun]], is classified as 5.1.10 (pattern 5, starting on syllable 1, 10 syllables long).\n\nThis system of labelling makes it possible to refer to the different metres in a simpler way than the traditional system, where the metre of [[Omar Khayyam]]'s quatrains is divided into 24 different patterns with labels such as ''hazaj-e musamman-e axrab-e maqb\u016bz-e makf\u016bf-e majb\u016bb''.<ref>Maling (1973), pp. 118-135.</ref>\n\nElwell-Sutton also calculated the frequency of occurrence of the various metres. He found that although over 100 different metres exist, 99% of classical Persian poems use one of a group of about 30 common metres, of which some are more frequent than others.\n\n==Rules of prosody==\n===Syllable length===\nTo \"[[scansion|scan]]\" a line of poetry is to establish which syllables are long and which are short so that it can be read properly. According to the European method, the line is first divided into syllables, each of which must contain a short vowel (''a, e, o''), a long vowel (''\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b'') or a diphthong (''ey, ow, \u0101y, \u016by''). A syllable must start with a consonant, if one is available, but not more than one. Thus {{lang|fa-Latn|goftan}} \"to say\" is divided {{lang|fa-Latn|gof-tan}} and {{lang|fa-Latn|'\u0101dam}} \"Adam\" is divided {{lang|fa-Latn|'\u0101-dam}}.\n\nSyllables in Persian poetry are of three lengths. Writing C for a consonant, V for a vowel, and VV for a long vowel or diphthong, the three lengths are as follows:\n*Short: CV, e.g. ''ke'', ''na''.\n*Long: CVV or CVC, e.g. ''n\u012b'', ''gof'', '' '\u0101'', ''mey''.\n*Overlong: CVVC, CVCC, CVVCC, e.g. ''k\u0101r'', ''dast'', ''d\u016bst''. (Exceptions: syllables ending in ''\u0101n'', ''\u012bn'', ''\u016bn'' usually count as long, not overlong.)<ref name=ES214>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 214; Thiesen (1982), pp. 39\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn Persian, the three lengths of syllable are referred to as {{lang|fa-Latn|k\u016bt\u0101h}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|boland}}, and {{lang|fa-Latn|der\u0101z}} respectively.<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 15.</ref>\n\nAt the end of a verse or half-line, the distinction between short, long, and overlong syllables is neutralised. Thus at the end of a line the syllables {{lang|fa-Latn|to}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|j\u0101}}, and {{lang|fa-Latn|d\u016bst}} are all counted as a single long syllable without distinction of length.<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 18.</ref>\n\n===Overlong syllables===\nAn overlong syllable can be substituted anywhere in a line where the metre has a long plus a short syllable (\u2013 u), and also at the beginning of the line where the metre has (x u).\n\nOverlong syllables not only add beauty to the line but also variety, since whenever an overlong syllable is used (except at line-end), the number of syllables is reduced.<ref>For discussion and statistics, see Elwell-Sutton (1976), pp. 126\u2013138.</ref> Thus in the first half of the following couplet from Saadi's ''[[Gulistan (book)|Golest\u0101n]]'', the metre (4.5.11), which normally has eleven syllables, is reduced to eight. In the second line, there are 9 syllables, because in addition to the overlong syllable in {{lang|fa-Latn|d\u016bst\u012b}}, the final u u \u2013 of the line is replaced by \u2013 \u2013. The overlong syllables are underlined in the transliteration:\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u067e\u0627\u064a\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u064a \u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0634\u0627\u064a\u062f \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u063a\u062f\u0627\u0631}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|y\u0101r-e n\u0101<u>p\u0101yd\u0101r</u> <u>d\u016bst</u> mad\u0101r}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>d\u016bs</u>t\u012b-r\u0101 na-\u0161\u0101yad \u012bn qadd\u0101r}}\n\n:\u2013 u \u2013 \u2013u \u2013u \u2013u u \u2013\n:\u2013u \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\n:\"Do not love a friend who is not steadfast;\n:this traitor is not worthy of friendship.\"\n\nWhen Persian poetry is recited, the three lengths of syllable, \"short\", \"long\", and \"overlong\" take different lengths of time to say. In an experiment, L. P. Elwell-Sutton recorded two well-educated Persian speakers reading a number of poems and measured the length of each syllable in hundredths of a second. Although the length of the syllables was variable (for example, a short syllable could be anything from 0.07 to 0.65 seconds), the average of the two speakers combined was as follows: short syllables 0.21 seconds, long syllables 0.33 seconds, overlong syllables 0.59 seconds.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 207.</ref>\n\nIn the traditional Turkish and Indian method of pronouncing Persian poetry, an overlong syllable is followed by a short anaptyctic vowel, known as {{lang|fa-Latn|n\u012bm-fathe}} (\"half-'a'\"), (for example, {{lang|fa-Latn|d\u016bs<sup>a</sup>t\u012b}} \"friendship\"), but in Iran this vowel is not usually used.<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 16.</ref> However, there are a few words, such as {{lang|fa-Latn|\u0101s(e)m\u0101n}} \"heaven\", where both pronunciations are allowed in dictionaries.\n\n===Minor rules of prosody===\n===='''Eyn'' and ''alef''====\nThe letter '' 'eyn'' (\u0639), which is pronounced as a [[glottal stop]] in Persian, is always counted in poetry as a consonant, e.g. '' 'e\u0161q'' {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0639\u0634\u0642}} \"love\".<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 22.</ref> Thus like any other consonant it can cause the previous syllable to become long, so that {{lang|fa|rtl=yes| \u0627\u0632\u0639\u0634\u0642}} ''az 'e\u0161q'' \"from love\" has the scansion \u2013 \u2013u.\n\nThe letter alef (\u0627) at the beginning of a word, on the other hand, can either be pronounced as a glottal stop, or ignored in scansion. Thus in Hafez's line beginning {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u06a9 \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0632\u06cc}} ''agar '\u0101n Tork-e \u0160\u012br\u0101z\u012b'' \"if that Shirazi Turk\", the glottal stop at the beginning of the word {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0622\u0646}} '' '\u0101n'' \"that\" is pronounced and the scansion is u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013\u00a0\u2013. But in most cases the alef is silent and has no effect on the length of the previous syllable. Different poets have different preferences in this; for example, verses where the alef is observed as a glottal stop are much more common in Rumi than in Sa'di.<ref>Heny (1981), pp. 88-89; Thiesen (1982), p. 21.</ref> The word {{lang|fa-Latn|ast}} \"is\" and other parts of the verb \"to be\" are always pronounced without a glottal stop; and there is also no glottal stop after a verbal prefix, for example {{lang|fa-Latn|bar-\u0101mad}} \"came up\".<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 20.</ref>\n\n====''Ez\u0101fe'' and final vowels====\nThe unwritten ''ez\u0101fe'' suffix (as in {{lang|fa-Latn|Tork-e \u0160\u012br\u0101z\u012b}} \"Shirazi Turk\") may be pronounced either long or short (''-e'' or ''-\u0113''), as the metre requires, and the word {{lang|fa-Latn|o}} \"and\" similarly may be either ''o'' or ''\u014d''. \n\nWords ending in short vowels, such as {{lang|fa-Latn|na}} \"neither\", {{lang|fa-Latn|to}} \"you\", {{lang|fa-Latn|x\u0101ne}} \"house\", can also have the final vowel lengthened where convenient.<ref>Heny (1981), pp. 143-145.</ref><ref>Thiesen (1982), pp. 23\u201327.</ref> When lengthened, these vowels do not change their quality, so that {{lang|fa-Latn|na}} is pronounced [n\u00e6:] rather than [n\u0251:].<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 9.</ref>\n\nWhen the sound ''\u012b'' (written \u06cc) is followed directly by another vowel in Persian words, as in {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u06cc\u0627}} {{lang|fa-Latn|biy\u0101}} \"come\", it is pronounced short, and similarly with the sounds ''ey'' and ''ow'' when they are followed by a vowel; for example {{lang|fa-Latn|'''mey'''-\u0113 b\u0101q\u012b}} \"the remaining wine\", {{lang|fa-Latn|be\u0161'''now''' az ney}} \"listen to the flute\", {{lang|fa-Latn|b\u012b'''ni''' \u0101n Tork}} \"do you see that Turk?\", where {{lang|fa-Latn|mey}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|now}}, and {{lang|fa-Latn|-ni}} are all short syllables, as required by the metre. However, the prefixes ''b\u012b-'' \"without\" and ''m\u012b-'' (the prefix making continuous tenses) are never shortened.<ref>Heny (1981), p. 95.</ref>\n\n====Alternative pronunciations====\nDifferent pronunciations of other words can also be used where convenient, for example, the word for \"from\" can be {{lang|fa-Latn|'az}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|az}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|ze}} or ''z-''; \"if\" can be {{lang|fa-Latn|agar}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|gar}} or {{lang|fa-Latn|ar}}; \"hungry\" can be {{lang|fa-Latn|gorsne}} or {{lang|fa-Latn|gorosne}}, and so on. The words {{lang|fa-Latn|va}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|ze}}, and {{lang|fa-Latn|ke}} (\"who\", \"that\", \"since\") are often joined on to the next word, e.g. {{lang|fa-Latn|v-agar}} \"and if\", {{lang|fa-Latn|z-\u012bn}} \"from this\", {{lang|fa-Latn|k-az}} \"since from\".<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), pp. 215-6.</ref>\n\nIn some words, a long vowel can be shortened (e.g. {{lang|fa-Latn|gon\u0101h}} \"sin\" can become {{lang|fa-Latn|gonah}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|d\u012bgar}} \"other\" can become {{lang|fa-Latn|degar}}). When this happens, the vowel quality changes.<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 62.</ref>\n\n====Silent ''v\u0101v''====\nThe silent letter ''v\u0101v'' (\u0648) which sometimes follows the letter ''xe'' (\u062e) in Persian words (e.g. {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0628}} {{lang|fa-Latn|x(w)\u0101b}} \"sleep\") is ignored in scansion.\n\n====Arabic words====\nLines of Arabic are sometimes included in Persian poems. The Arabic is pronounced with Persian phonology (for example, \u0636 and \u0638 are both pronounced ''z''), and unless the whole poem is Arabic, the metre is Persian.<ref>Thiesen (1982), pp. 69\u201372.</ref>\n\n== Word accent and metre ==\nThe word accent in Persian (which is pronounced as a combination of high pitch and stress)<ref>Hosseini, Seyed Ayat (2014), p. 22f for a review of the literature; also p. 35.</ref> at first sight does not affect the metre. In the following couplet of [[Hafez|H\u0101fez]], for example, although the two verses are parallel in structure, the word accent (which generally is heard on the last syllable of each word) comes three times on short syllables in the first verse, but three times on long syllables in the second verse. The accent is shown here by transcribing the accented vowels in '''bold''':\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0632\u0644\u0641 \u0622\u0634\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0628 \u0648 \u0645\u0633\u062a}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u067e\u06cc\u0631\u0647\u0646 \u0686\u0627\u06a9 \u0648 \u063a\u0632\u0644 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0635\u0631\u0627\u062d\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0633\u062a}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>zolf</u>-'\u0101\u0161oft'''e'''-vo xoy-kard'''e'''-vo xand\u0101n-l'''a'''b-o <u>m'''a'''st</u>}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>p\u012br</u>han-\u010d'''\u0101'''k-o qazal-x'''\u0101'''n-o sor\u0101h'''\u012b''' dar <u>d'''a'''st</u>}}\n\n:x u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013\n\n:\"Hair-tousled, perspiring, smiling-lipped, and drunk,\n:shirt torn, singing songs, and wine-flask in hand\"\n\nHowever, the word accent cannot be entirely disregarded. In metres with the rhythms | u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | or | \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 |, there is a clear tendency for the word-accent to be on the 2nd and 4th syllables of the feet. The possibility remains that each metre has a \"natural\" pattern of stress, which is deviated from deliberately to create interest and tension.<ref>For discussion see Heny (1981), pp. 281-341.</ref>\n\n==Division into feet==\nThe Arabic prosodists divide the lines of verse up into \"[[foot (prosody)|feet]]\" or \"prosodic words\"<ref>Farzaad (1967)</ref> ({{lang|ar-Latn|rukn}} or {{lang|ar-Latn|rokn}}, pl. {{lang|ar-Latn|ark\u0101n}}) of three to five syllables each; thus the metre of the Shahnameh is divided as | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 |, pronounced as {{lang|ar-Latn|fa'\u016blun fa'\u016blun fa'\u016blun fa'\u016bl}}, using made up words derived from the Arabic verb {{lang|ar|rtl=yes|\u0641\u0639\u0644}} {{lang|fa-Latn|f\u02bel}} \"to do\".

However, sometimes such breaks are found elsewhere, one common place being after the eleventh syllable in the above metre.<ref>Heny (1981), p. 208.</ref> Different poets differ in their style. In the above metre, a sentence-break at the mid-point of the line is particularly common in Rumi, being found in 75% of the lines examined in a study by Jeannine Heny, whereas in Saadi it came at this place in only 25% of the lines.\n\n===Type of feet===\nWhere the division into feet is uncontroversial, the preference is usually for feet which end in a heavy syllable. Thus in the second pattern, the feet u \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0, \u2013\u00a0u \u2013 \u2013 , \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 exist, but \u2013 \u2013\u00a0\u2013 u is not found. There is also a preference for feet of four syllables, rather than three or five; thus the ''k\u0101mil'' metre (common in Arabic) with its repeated five-syllable foot of u u \u2013 u \u2013 does not easily fit into the Persian metrical system and is almost never found.\n\n===The ''ruba'i''===\nAlthough the division into feet is often clear, in other cases, especially with the compound metres of patterns 4 and 5, it is less obvious. Elwell-Sutton therefore left the metres undivided. For example, the traditional foot division for the ''ruba'i'' metre (5.1.13) is as follows:<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 55.</ref>\n:| \u2013 \u2013 u | u \u2013 u \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 u | u \u2013 |\n\nThe phonologist [[Bruce Hayes (linguist)|Bruce Hayes]] proposed dividing it as follows:<ref>Hayes (1979), p. 217.</ref>\n:| \u2013 \u2013 u u | \u2013 u \u2013 u | \u2013 \u2013 u u | \u2013 |\n\nBut Masoud Farzaad,<ref>Farzaad (1967), p. 113.</ref><ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farzad Farz\u0101d, Mas'\u016bd], ''Encyclopaedia Iranica''.</ref> followed by Thiesen,<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 167.</ref> divided it as follows:\n:| \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 || u \u2013 u \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 |\n\nThis seems better to fit the way a ''ruba'i'' is actually composed, since there is often a phrase-break (or potential pause) at the point that Farzaad marks with ||. He refers to this point as the \"hinge\" of the line.<ref>Farzaad (1967), p. 58.</ref>\n\nIn the ''ruba'i'' the rhythm after the \"hinge\" can be either \u2013 u or u \u2013. The same choice is sometimes found in early poets in the metre 3.4.7(2) in the same way after the break:<ref>Thiesen (1982), pp. 100, 153.</ref>\n:| x x u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 || x x u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 |\n\n===''Biceps'' elements===\n{{see|Biceps (prosody)}}\nIn metres where a line ends with the sequence u u \u2013, as in the above ''ruba'i'' metre, the two short syllables are often replaced with a single long syllable.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), pp. 126\u2013137.</ref> This replacement is also found in the first half of the line, but much less commonly. In a sample of 200 lines taken from the ''ruba'i'' metres, Elwell-Sutton found that the final u u \u2013 became \u2013 \u2013 in 50% of lines, the first u u \u2013 became \u2013 \u2013 in 5% of lines, and for the middle u u \u2013 there were no examples.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 134.</ref>\n\nWhen the rhythm u u \u2013 is replaced by \u2013 \u2013 in the first half of the line, there is usually a phrase boundary or potential pause after the second long syllable.<ref>For discussion see Heny (1981), pp. 116-135.</ref> The following line from a ''ruba'i'' is typical:\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|goft\u0101, \u0161eyx\u0101,}} || {{lang|fa-Latn|har \u0101n\u010de g\u016b'\u012b hastam}}\n: \u2013 | \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 || u \u2013 u \u2013 | \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 |\n:She said, o Sheikh! I am what you say I am.\n\nThe ''biceps'' ending \u2013 <u>u u</u> \u2013 is also sometimes found in Arabic poetry, in the [[basit|bas\u012b\u1e6d]] metre, for example in poems written by the poet [[Abu Nuwas]], who was of half-Persian origin.\n\n==Rhyme==\nPersian poems always use rhyme, and from the point of view of rhyme can be classified into various types: \n\n*Poems in rhyming couplets, each couplet with a different rhyme, thus with the scheme ''aa bb cc ...''. A poem of this type is known as a ''[[Mathnawi (poetic form)|masnavi]]'' (plural ''masnav\u012by\u0101t''). The poems in rhyming couplets can be of any length from a single couplet to long poems such as [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahnameh]], which is over 50,000 couplets long, or [[Rumi]]'s [[Masnavi|Masnavi-ye Ma'navi]] \"Spiritual Masnavi\", of over 25,000 couplets.\n\n*Lyric poems, in which, apart from the first line, the two halves of each verse do not rhyme, but the same rhyme is used at the end of every verse throughout the poem, thus ''aa ba ca ...''. Among lyric poems with a single rhyme throughout, the two most common forms are the [[ghazal]] (a short poem usually about love) and the [[qasida]] (which is longer, and may be over 100 verses). The short [[ruba'i]] (quatrain) and [[do-bayti]], which usually have the rhyme scheme ''aa ba'', also belong to this type.\n\n*[[stanza|Stanzaic]] poems, which have rhyme schemes such as ''aaabb, cccbb, dddbb'' and so on.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1975), pp. 93\u201394.</ref> Stanzaic poems first seem to have been introduced in the 11th century by such poets as [[Farrukhi Sistani|Farrokhi]] and [[Manuchehri]].<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1975), p. 93.</ref>\n\n*Very short poems (typically of two lines) which are included in works such as Saadi's [[Gulistan (book)|Golestan]]. In these, the rhyme-scheme ''ab cb'' is typical, but ''ab ab'', ''aa bb'', and ''aa aa'' are also found.\n\nPersian rhymes often consist of a single syllable, for example ''m\u0101h / siy\u0101h''; but there are also plenty of instances of longer rhymes, such ''s\u0101zande / nav\u0101zande'' or ''p\u016byandag\u0101n / g\u016byandag\u0101n''.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1975), p. 89.</ref> Following the actual rhyming word there may be a ''rad\u012bf'', which is a word or series of words that is repeated after every rhyme, for example ''\u0161ek\u0101yat m\u012bkonad / hek\u0101yat m\u012bkonad'' (Rumi). As well as the main rhyme, there may also be additional internal rhymes in a verse.\n\nPersian rhyme sometimes provides evidence of an earlier pronunciation of the language. For example, in Saadi's poem \"Cloud and wind\" quoted below, the word ''naxor\u012b'' rhymes with ''nabar\u012b'', presumably because in Saadi's day, at least in poetry, the first word was pronounced ''naxwar\u012b''.<ref>Dictionaries of Middle Persian give the word for \"to eat\" as ''xvartan'' or ''xwardan'' (wiktionary: {{wikt-lang|fa|\u062e\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0646}}); cf. Elwell-Sutton (1975), p. 89.</ref>\n\nA feature of classical Persian pronunciation which is no longer observed in Iran today is the distinction between long ''\u014d'' and ''\u016b'', and between ''\u0113'' and ''\u012b''; for example, {{lang|fa-Latn|\u0161\u0113r}} \"lion\" vs. {{lang|fa-Latn|\u0161\u012br}} \"milk\".<ref>Thiesen (1982), pp. 3\u20134.</ref> These days both ''\u014d'' and ''\u016b'' are pronounced ''\u016b'', and ''\u0113'' and ''\u012b'' are pronounced ''\u012b''; in classical times the indefinite article suffix ''-\u0113'' did not rhyme with ''-\u012b'' \"you are\".<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 74.</ref> However, the original pronunciation of these vowels can still be heard in eastern traditions, such as those of Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and India. (See [[Persian phonology]].)\n\n==A table of common metres==\nThe list of metres below is based on the one in Elwell-Sutton's ''The Persian Metres''.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1986), table 21.</ref> The patterns are read from left to right. u = short syllable; \u2013 = long syllable; x = either long or short. \u2013 u or x u may be replaced by an overlong syllable (\u2013u); an overlong syllable may also replace the final syllable of any verse.\n\nThe sign (M) after a metre indicates one of the seven metres traditionally used in ''[[masnavi (poetic form)|masnaviyat]]'' (long poems in rhyming couplets such as Ferdowsi's [[Shahnameh]] or Rumi's mystical [[Masnavi]]).<ref>Hayes (1979), p. 212.</ref> Except for one metre in 10 syllables, all the ''masnavi'' metres have 11 syllables, a feature that may date to pre-Islamic times, since 11-syllable metre seems to have been common at that time.\n\nThe sign (R) indicates one of the two metres used in making ''[[Ruba'i|rub\u0101'iy\u0101t]]'' (quatrains). These two metres (5.1.13 and 3.3.13), which are really variations of the same metre, are used only for ''rub\u0101'iy\u0101t''. Very similar to the ''ruba'i'' is the ''[[do-bayt\u012b]]'', which uses the metre 5.1.11.\n\nThe frequency column shows the percentage of lyric poems in each metre, out of a sample of over 20,000 poems, as counted by L. D. Elwell-Sutton.<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 162.</ref> Since this covers only lyric poems, it omits ''masnav\u012by\u0101t'' and ''rob\u0101'\u012by\u0101t''.\n\nFor lyric poems, the metres of pattern 4 (43.8%) are the most common, followed by pattern 2 (27.6%) and pattern 3 (19.7%). Pattern 5 (5.4%) and pattern 1 (3.3%) are less frequently used, and metres in patterns other than the normal five are used in only 0.2% of the poems Elwell-Sutton examined.<ref name=\"Elwell-Sutton 1976, p. 162\">Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 162.</ref>\n\nThe traditional Arabic names are given in their Persian pronunciation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

An example is 3.4.11:\n:| \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 |\n\nThe metre 3.4.07(2), which has a pause internally, is catalectic in both halves of the line:\n:| \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 || \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 |\n\nThis can be compared with the full version of the same metre, 3.4.16:\n:| \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013 u u \u2013 |\n\nThe commonly used ''mojtass'' metre (4.1.15) is another catalectic metre, since it is made up of two sections, 8 and 7 syllables long, often with a break between:\n:| u \u2013 u \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 || u \u2013 u \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 |\n\nIt has been argued that metres can be shortened at the beginning as well as at the end of the line.<ref>Farzaad (1967), pp. 58\u201364.</ref> For example, the ''khaf\u012bf'' metre (4.5.11) is simply the ''mojtass'' (4.1.15) with the first foot removed:\n:| x u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 | <u>u u</u> \u2013 |\n\n==Examples of the metres from Persian poets==\nIn the section below, examples are given of some well known poems in various of the above metres. The transliteration is based on that approved by the United Nations in 2012, which represents the current pronunciation of educated speakers in Iran, except that to make scansion easier, the long vowels are marked (\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b).<ref>''[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/10th-uncsgn-docs/econf/E_CONF.101_118_Rev.1_Transcription%20symbols%20for%20Persian_Updated.pdf New Persian Romanization System.

These are pronounced longer than the usual long syllables\n\n===Pattern 1 (''motaq\u0101reb'')===\nThe first pattern, based on the foot u \u2013 \u2013, is known by the Arabic name ''mutaq\u0101rib'' (''motaq\u0101reb''). It is found in only two metres, 1.1.11 and 1.1.12.<ref>A 9-syllable version exists but is extremely rare: Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 147.</ref> The first of these is mostly used for ''masnav\u012b'' (rhyming couplet) poems, but also occasionally for monorhyme lyric poems.\n\n====Ferdowsi's ''Shahnameh''====\nThe metre 1.1.11 is one of the earliest to be found in Persian poetry of the Islamic period and is one of the seven metres used to make the long poems known as ''[[masnavi (poetic form)|masnavi]]''.

This rhythm is not found in Arabic, and it may well go back to ancient Persian times, since it was associated by the Ancient Greeks with Asia Minor and Persia, and known as ''persicus'' or ''[[Ionic meter|ionicus]]''. It was used for example in the opening chorus of [[Aeschylus]]'s play ''The Persians''.<ref>Thiesen (1982), pp. 132, 263\u20134.</ref>\n\nWhenever a poem begins with u u \u2013 \u2013, the first foot may be replaced by \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 or \u2013u \u2013 \u2013, and in fact this change occurs in about 80% of poems,<ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), pp. 128\u2013129.</ref> with slight differences from one poet to another.<ref>Heny (1981), p. 161.</ref> It is also quite common for the final u u \u2013 to become \u2013 \u2013, although substitution of a long for two shorts in other places in the line is rare.\n\nPoems of pattern 3, when set to music, are often in three-time rhythm.\n\nBecause the foot used, ''fa'el\u0101ton'', is similar to the ''f\u0101'el\u0101ton'' of pattern 2.4 above, this rhythm is likewise known as ''ramal''. However, to distinguish it from 2.4, it is known as ''ramal-e maxb\u016bn'' (literally \"hemmed ''ramal''&thinsp;\", on the analogy of a tailor shortening a dress by hemming it).<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 132.</ref>\n\n====\"Cloud and wind\"====\nAn example of 3.1.15 is the following poem, which comes from the introduction to [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]]'s [[Gulistan (book)|Golest\u0101n]]:\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u0648 \u0628\u0627\u062f \u0648 \u0645\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u0631\u0634\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u0641\u0644\u06a9 \u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0646\u062f}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062a\u0627 \u062a\u0648 \u0646\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u0641 \u0622\u0631\u06cc\u0651 \u0648 \u0628\u0647 \u063a\u0641\u0644\u062a \u0646\u062e\u0648\u0631\u06cc}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0647\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0628\u0647\u0631 \u062a\u0648 \u0633\u0631\u06af\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0648 \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0634\u0631\u0637 \u0627\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0641 \u0646\u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u062a\u0648 \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0628\u0631\u06cc}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|abr o b\u0101d \u014d mah o xorsh\u012bd o falak dar k\u0101r-<u>and</u>}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|t\u0101 to n\u0101n-\u012b be kaf \u0101r\u012b yo be qeflat na-xor\u012b}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|hame 'az bahr-e to sarga\u0161te vo farm\u0101n-bor<u>d\u0101r</u>}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|\u0161art-e 'en<u>s\u0101f</u> na-b\u0101\u0161ad ke to farm\u0101n na-bar\u012b}}\n\n:| \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 \u2013 |\n:| \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 |\n:| u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 \u2013 |\n:| \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 |\n\n:\"Cloud and wind and moon and sun and firmament are at work\n:so that you may get some bread in your hand and not eat it neglectfully.\n:All for your sake are perplexed and obedient to command;\n:it is not a fair condition that you should not obey the command.\"\n\nThe metre requires the second ''o'' \"and\" in the first line above to be pronounced long.

In exactly the same way, metricians have suggested that the anacreontic may be derived by anaclasis from an ionic dimeter (u u \u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 \u2013).<ref>M. L.

It is also unusual in that this combined metre is only used for {{lang|fa-Latn|rob\u0101'\u012by\u0101t}} and not for other types of poem. In fact the two metres are the same except that the 6th and 7th syllables are reversed. The rhythm is therefore the following:\n\n: \u2013 | \u2013 <u>u u</u> \u2013 || u \u2013 u \u2013 | \u2013\u00a0<u>u u</u> \u2013 | or\n: \u2013 | \u2013 <u>u u</u> \u2013 || \u2013 u u \u2013 | \u2013\u00a0<u>u u</u> \u2013 |\n\nThe foot divisions are those suggested by Farzaad.<ref>Farzaad (1967), p. 113; cf. Thiesen (1982), p. 167.</ref> At the point marked ||, which Farzaad calls the \"hinge\" of the line, in some kinds of traditional recitation there is often a pause.<ref>See External links, Tajik girls.</ref><ref>cf. also Heny (1981).</ref>\n\nThe metre 5.1.13 is more common than 3.3.13; in an extensive survey of quatrains by Khayyam and Hafez, Farzaad found 70% of lines were in 5.1.13.<ref>Farzaad (1942), p. 70.</ref><ref>See Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 135 for statistics; in his slightly smaller survey he found 60% were in 5.1.13.</ref> 21% of 100 quatrains examined by Elwell-Sutton were entirely in 5.1.13, but only 8% entirely in 3.3.13. The rest were mixed. \n\nThe ending u u \u2013 is changed to \u2013 \u2013 in nearly half of all verses. Substitution of \u2013 for u u in syllables 3 and 4 is much less common; it occurs in only 5% of lines according to Farzaad.<ref>Farzaad (1942), p. 68.</ref><ref>Elwell-Sutton (1976), p. 134.</ref> (In theory the substitution of \u2013 for u u may also occur in syllables 7 and 8, but this is exceedingly rare.)

Key proposals included the introduction of strategic management to strengthen unity of purpose, the establishment of the position of Deputy Secretary-General, a 10-percent reduction in posts, a reduction in administrative costs, the consolidation of the UN at the country level, and reaching out to civil society and the private sector as partners.

He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections.

He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections. He claimed that on one occasion, Annan refused to implement a no-notice inspection of the [[Iraqi Special Security Organization|SSO]] headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access, but the negotiation ended up taking nearly six weeks, giving the Iraqis more than enough time to clean out the site.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/ritter.html|title=The Iraqi Threat: How Real Is It?|accessdate=6 January 2011|date=October 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091228/http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/ritter.html|archive-date=11 May 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the build-up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Annan called on the United States and the United Kingdom not to invade without the support of the United Nations.

While her magical power with Peng has been weakening, Chalan has started to have the magical power leading to her confusion - who is the one for her.

The terms were titled the ''Convention of Saratoga'', and specified that the troops would be sent back to [[Europe]] after giving a [[parole#Prisoners of war|parole]] that they would not fight again in the conflict.<ref name=\"Morrissey87\">[[#Morrissey|Morrissey (2000)]], p. 87</ref> The British army was accorded the [[honours of war]], and Burgoyne had his sword returned to him by Gates.\n\n[[Frederika Charlotte Riedesel|Baroness Frederika Riedesel]], wife of [[Friedrich Adolf Riedesel|General Riedesel]], just emerged from her shelter in the cellar of [[Marshall House (Schuylerville, New York)|the Marshall House]], attended the surrender ceremony which she vividly describes in her ''Journal'': \"On the 17th of October the capitulation was consummated. The generals waited upon the American general-in-chief, Gates, and the troops laid down their arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war\".\n\n==Cambridge==\nA total of about 5,900 [[British Army|British]], [[Germans in the American Revolution|German]], and Canadian troops surrendered at Saratoga.<ref name=\"Morrissey86\">[[#Morrissey|Morrissey (2000)]], p. 86</ref>  Under guard by [[John Glover (general)|John Glover]]'s troops, they were marched to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where they arrived on 8 November.<ref name=\"Morrissey87\" />  The rank and file were quartered in crude barracks that had been constructed during the 1775 [[siege of Boston]], while most of the officers were billeted in houses.  The army ended up spending about one year in Cambridge, while negotiations concerning its status took place in military and diplomatic channels.  During this year, about 1,300 prisoners escaped, often because they became involved with local women while working on farms in the area.<ref name=\"Ferling432\">[[#Ferling|Ferling (2007)]], p. 432</ref>\n\nThe [[Continental Congress]] ordered Burgoyne to provide a list and description of all officers to ensure that they would not return. When he refused, Congress revoked the terms of the Convention, resolving in January 1778 to hold the army until [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] ratified the convention, an act they believed unlikely to happen, as it represented an acknowledgment of American independence.<ref name=\"Morrissey87\"/>\n\n==Virginia==\nIn November 1778, the Convention Army began marching south 700 miles (1,100 km) to [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], arriving in uncharacteristically snowy weather in January 1779.  Approximately 600 men escaped during the march.<ref name=\"Ferling432\"/>  They were held at the hastily and poorly constructed [[Albemarle Barracks]] until the fall of 1780, under the guard of Lt. Col Joseph Crockett's Western Battalion.\n\nDuring the army's years in Virginia it had an important economic impact on the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]] area of [[Virginia]].  The Virginia troops assigned to guard duty were generally better fed and equipped than any other forces, so that prisoner letters would reflect a strong [[Continental Army]]. Money sent by the prisoner's families in Britain and [[Germany]] provided a lot of [[hard currency]] and coin for the back-country area. The presence of the POWs created new demands for food and other goods - items for which they had to pay steep prices. [[Thomas Jefferson]] estimated that the presence of the prisoners increased the area's circulating currency by at least $30,000 a week. \n\nHigh-ranking officers, and sometimes their wives, such as the [[Baron von Riedesel|Major General Riedesel]] and [[Frederika Charlotte Riedesel|his wife]] and Major General [[William Phillips (British Army officer)|William Phillips]] were sought as guests on the social scene. The rank-and-file, however, dealt with miserable living conditions as the small amount of money appropriated to build the barracks proved inadequate. \"Each barrack,\" observed Lieutenant August Wilhelm Du Roi, \"is 24 feet long, and 14 feet wide, big enough to shelter 18 men. The construction is so miserable that it surpasses all that you can imagine in Germany of a very poorly built log house.

An excerpt from the Orderly Book of Crockett's Western Battalion elaborates: \"The commanding officer has been informed that an officer of the Convention Army who is residing in a different part of the county makes a practice of going to Negrew quarters in the night and associating with slaves, to the disatisdaction of the inhabitants. This practice is positively forbid in future...\"\nIn late 1780, when British forces became active in Virginia, the army was again moved, this time being marched by the Western Battalion north to [[Frederick, Maryland]]. Except for specific officer exchanges, they were held there until 1783. When the war formally ended, those who survived the forced marches and camp [[fever]]s were sent home.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal |last=Chase |first=Philander |title=Years of Hardships and Revelations: The Convention Army at the Albamarle Barracks, 1779\u20131781 |year=1983 |journal=The Magazine of Albemarle County History |volume=41 |location=Charlottesville, VA |ref=AlbCoHistSociety}}\n* {{cite book |title=Almost a miracle: the American victory in the War of Independence |first=John E |last=Ferling |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-518121-0 |ref=Ferling |location=New York |oclc=85898929 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/almostmiracleam00ferl }}\n* {{cite book |title=Saratoga 1777: Turning Point of a Revolution |first=Brendan |last=Morrissey |publisher=Osprey Publishing |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-85532-862-4 |ref=Morrissey |oclc=43419003 |location=Oxford}}\n* {{cite book |last=Smith |first=Clifford Neal |title=Brunswick Deserter-Immigrants of the American Revolution |year=1973 |publisher=Heritage House |location=Thomson, IL |ref=Smith |isbn=0-915162-00-8}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101128235214/http://themarshallhouse.org/ The Marshall House, Schuylerville, New York]\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:American Revolutionary War prisoners of war held by the United States|*]]\n[[Category:Virginia in the American Revolution]]\n[[Category:Pennsylvania in the American Revolution]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=May 2009}}\n[[File:Encampment of the convention army at Charlotte Ville in Virginia.jpg|thumb|300px|A 1789 etching depicting the encampment of the Convention Army at [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]]]\nThe '''Convention Army''' (1777\u20131783) was an army of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] and allied troops captured after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. \n\n==Convention of Saratoga==\nOn 17 October 1777, British General [[John Burgoyne]] surrendered his army according to terms negotiated with American general [[Horatio Gates]] following the 7 October [[Battle of Bemis Heights]].  The terms were titled the ''Convention of Saratoga'', and specified that the troops would be sent back to [[Europe]] after giving a [[parole#Prisoners of war|parole]] that they would not fight again in the conflict.<ref name=\"Morrissey87\">[[#Morrissey|Morrissey (2000)]], p. 87</ref> The British army was accorded the [[honours of war]], and Burgoyne had his sword returned to him by Gates.\n\n[[Frederika Charlotte Riedesel|Baroness Frederika Riedesel]], wife of [[Friedrich Adolf Riedesel|General Riedesel]], just emerged from her shelter in the cellar of [[Marshall House (Schuylerville, New York)|the Marshall House]], attended the surrender ceremony which she vividly describes in her ''Journal'': \"On the 17th of October the capitulation was consummated. The generals waited upon the American general-in-chief, Gates, and the troops laid down their arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war\".\n\n==Cambridge==\nA total of about 5,900 [[British Army|British]], [[Germans in the American Revolution|German]], and Canadian troops surrendered at Saratoga.<ref name=\"Morrissey86\">[[#Morrissey|Morrissey (2000)]], p. 86</ref>  Under guard by [[John Glover (general)|John Glover]]'s troops, they were marched to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where they arrived on 8 November.<ref name=\"Morrissey87\" />  The rank and file were quartered in crude barracks that had been constructed during the 1775 [[siege of Boston]], while most of the officers were billeted in houses.  The army ended up spending about one year in Cambridge, while negotiations concerning its status took place in military and diplomatic channels.  During this year, about 1,300 prisoners escaped, often because they became involved with local women while working on farms in the area.<ref name=\"Ferling432\">[[#Ferling|Ferling (2007)]], p. 432</ref>\n\nThe [[Continental Congress]] ordered Burgoyne to provide a list and description of all officers to ensure that they would not return. When he refused, Congress revoked the terms of the Convention, resolving in January 1778 to hold the army until [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] ratified the convention, an act they believed unlikely to happen, as it represented an acknowledgment of American independence.<ref name=\"Morrissey87\"/>\n\n==Virginia==\nIn November 1778, the Convention Army began marching south 700 miles (1,100 km) to [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], arriving in uncharacteristically snowy weather in January 1779.  Approximately 600 men escaped during the march.<ref name=\"Ferling432\"/>  They were held at the hastily and poorly constructed [[Albemarle Barracks]] until 1781.\n\nDuring the army's years in Virginia it had an important economic impact on the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]] area of [[Virginia]].  The Virginia troops assigned to guard duty were generally better fed and equipped than any other forces, so that prisoner letters would reflect a strong [[Continental Army]]. Money sent by the prisoner's families in Britain and [[Germany]] provided a lot of [[hard currency]] and coin for the back-country area. The presence of the POWs created new demands for food and other goods - items for which they had to pay steep prices. [[Thomas Jefferson]] estimated that the presence of the prisoners increased the area's circulating currency by at least $30,000 a week. \n\nHigh-ranking officers, and sometimes their wives, such as the [[Baron von Riedesel|Major General Riedesel]] and [[Frederika Charlotte Riedesel|his wife]] and Major General [[William Phillips (British Army officer)|William Phillips]] were sought as guests on the social scene. The rank-and-file, however, dealt with miserable living conditions as the small amount of money appropriated to build the barracks proved inadequate. \"Each barrack,\" observed Lieutenant August Wilhelm Du Roi, \"is 24 feet long, and 14 feet wide, big enough to shelter 18 men. The construction is so miserable that it surpasses all that you can imagine in Germany of a very poorly built log house. It is something like the following: Each side is put up of 8 to 9 round fir trees, which are laid one on top the other, but so far apart that it is almost possible for a man to crawl through ... The roof is made of round trees covered with split fir trees...\" And then, \"a great number of our men preferred to camp out in the woods, where they could protect themselves better against the cold than in the barracks.\"<ref name=\"Chase12\">[[#Chase|Chase (1983)]], p. 12</ref>\n\nIn 1781, when British forces became active in Virginia, the army was again moved, this time being marched north to [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]. Except for specific officer exchanges, they were held there until 1783. When the war formally ended, those who survived the forced marches and camp [[fever]]s were sent home.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal |last=Chase |first=Philander |title=Years of Hardships and Revelations: The Convention Army at the Albamarle Barracks, 1779\u20131781 |year=1983 |journal=The Magazine of Albemarle County History |volume=41 |location=Charlottesville, VA |ref=AlbCoHistSociety}}\n* {{cite book |title=Almost a miracle: the American victory in the War of Independence |first=John E |last=Ferling |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-518121-0 |ref=Ferling |location=New York |oclc=85898929 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/almostmiracleam00ferl }}\n* {{cite book |title=Saratoga 1777: Turning Point of a Revolution |first=Brendan |last=Morrissey |publisher=Osprey Publishing |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-85532-862-4 |ref=Morrissey |oclc=43419003 |location=Oxford}}\n* {{cite book |last=Smith |first=Clifford Neal |title=Brunswick Deserter-Immigrants of the American Revolution |year=1973 |publisher=Heritage House |location=Thomson, IL |ref=Smith |isbn=0-915162-00-8}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101128235214/http://themarshallhouse.org/ The Marshall House, Schuylerville, New York]\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:American Revolutionary War prisoners of war held by the United States|*]]\n[[Category:Virginia in the American Revolution]]\n[[Category:Pennsylvania in the American Revolution]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1003:b85e:92d6:bc92:1a86:4e58:725", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eVirginia:Added content based on the recently transcribed orderly book of Crockett's Western Battalion, a Virginia State force which guarded the convention army from spring of 1780 through spring of 1781.
