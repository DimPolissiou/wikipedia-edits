This period was followed by one of the [[Roman Empire]]'s rule or influence.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] for a period also controlled parts of the region.\n\nAlgeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia established the Arab Maghreb Union in 1989 to promote cooperation and [[economic integration]] in a [[common market]].

These trade relations can be dated at least to the [[Phoenicians]] in the 1st millennium BC. (The Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] was founded, according to tradition, in what is now Tunisia circa 800 BC).\n\nThe [[Berbers]] predominantly constructed their coastal ports and cities. Later, some Phoenicians and Carthaginians arrived for trade. The main Berber and Phoenician settlements centered in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] ([[Carthage]], [[Utica, Tunisia]]) along the North African [[littoral]], between the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and the Libyan coast east of ancient [[Cyrenaica]]. They dominated the trade and intercourse of the [[Western Mediterranean]] for centuries. The Carthage defeat in the [[Punic Wars]] in 206 BC allowed Rome to establish the [[Province of Africa]] and control many of these ports. Rome eventually took control of the entire Maghreb north of the Atlas Mountains. Rome was greatly helped by the defection of King [[Massinissa]] and Carthage's eastern Numidian [[Massylii]] client-allies. Some of the most mountainous regions, such as the Moroccan [[Rif]], remained outside Rome's control. The pressure put on the [[Western Roman Empire]] by the [[Barbarian invasions]] (the [[Vandals]] and [[Hispania|Spain]]) in the 5th century reduced Roman control and led to the establishment of the [[Vandal Kingdom]]in 430 A.D. with its capital at Carthage. A century later, the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] sent a force under General [[Belisarius]] that [[Vandalic War|succeeded in destroying]] the Vandal Kingdom. [[Exarchate of Carthage|Byzantine rule]] lasted for 150 years. The Berbers contested outside-the-area control. After the advent of [[Islam]] in the 640s\u2013700 AD period, Arabs took control of the entire region.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{main|Ifriqiya|Umayyad Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphate|Idrisid dynasty|Almoravid dynasty|Kingdom of Africa|Almohad Caliphate|Hafsid dynasty|Marinid dynasty|Ziyyanid dynasty|Wattasid dynasty}}\n[[File:Kairouan Mosque Courtyard.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], founded by the Arab general Uqba Ibn Nafi (in 670), is the oldest mosque in the Maghreb city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&pg=PA128&dq=kairouan+oldest+mosque+maghreb&hl=fr&ei=YDg8TbPsH8vAswbDhszzBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam, Language and Meaning: Commemorative Edition'', World Wisdom, Inc, 2009, page 128]</ref>]]\n\nThe Arabs reached the Maghreb in early [[Umayyad]] times. Islamic Berber kingdoms such as the [[Almohad]]s expansion and the spread of [[Islam]] contributed to the development of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. While restricted due to the cost and dangers, the trade was highly profitable. Commodities traded included such goods as salt, gold, ivory, and [[Arab slave trade|enslaved persons from sub-Saharan regions]]. Arab control over the Maghreb was quite weak. Various Islamic variations, such as the [[Ibadi]]s and the [[Shia]], were adopted by some Berbers, often leading to scorning of [[Caliph]]al control in favour of their own interpretation of Islam.\n\nAs a result of the invasion of the [[Banu Hilal]] Arabs, the [[Arabic language]] and dialects spread slowly without eliminating Berber. These Arabs had been set upon the Berbers by the [[Fatimid]]s in punishment for their [[Zirid]] former Berber clients who defected and abandoned [[Shiism]] in the 12th century. Throughout this period, the Berber world most often was divided into three states, roughly corresponding to modern Morocco, western Algeria, and eastern Algeria and [[Tunisia]]. The region was occasionally briefly unified, as under the [[Almohad]] Berber empire, and briefly under the [[Marinid]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{main|Barbary Coast|Saadi dynasty|Alaouite dynasty|Ottoman Algeria|Ottoman Tunisia|Ottoman Tripolitania}}\n[[File:Guillaume Delisle North West Africa 1707.jpg|thumb|1707 map of northwest Africa by [[Guillaume Delisle]], including the Maghreb\nAfter the Middle Ages, the [[Ottoman Empire]] loosely controlled the area east of Morocco.]]\n\n===Modern history===\n{{further|Spanish Morocco|Spanish Sahara|French protectorate of Morocco|French Algeria|French Protectorate of Tunisia|Italian Libya}}\n{{further|North African Campaign (World War I)|North African Campaign|Western Desert Campaign}}\n{{further|Western Sahara War|Algerian War of Independence|History of Algeria since 1962|History of modern Tunisia|Kingdom of Libya|Libya under Gaddafi}}\nAfter the 19th century, areas of the Maghreb were colonized by [[France]], [[Spain]] and later [[Italy]].\n\nToday, more than two and a half million Maghrebi immigrants live in France, many from Algeria and Morocco.

In northern coastal towns, in particular, several waves of European immigrants influenced the population in the Medieval era. Most notable were the [[morisco]]s and [[muladi]]es, that is, the indigenous [[Spaniards]] (Moors) who were forcibly converted to Catholicism and later were expelled, together with ethnic Arab and Berber Muslims, from the [[Reconquista|Spanish Catholic Reconquista]].{{awkward|date=April 2020}} Other European contributions included the French, Italian, and English crew and passengers taken captive by the [[Barbary corsairs|corsairs]].

These were later augmented by Sephardic Jews from Spain and Portugal who, fleeing the Spanish Catholic Inquisition of the 15th and 16th centuries, established a presence in North Africa. They settled primarily in the urban trading centers. Many Jews from Spain emigrated to North America from the Maghreb in the 19th and early 20th centuries, or to France and Israel later in the 20th century after the latter was founded.\n\nAnother significant group are Turks, who migrated with the expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A large [[Kouloughli|ethnic Turkish]] population exists, particularly in Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.\n\nSub-Saharan Africans joined the population mix during centuries of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. Traders and slaves went to the Maghreb from the [[Sahel]] region. On the Saharan southern edge of the Maghreb are small communities of black populations, sometimes called [[Haratine]]. They appear to have descended from black populations who inhabited the Sahara during its last wet period and then migrated north as it turned to desert.\n\nIn Algeria especially, a large European minority, known as the \"[[pied noir]]s\", immigrated to the region, settling under French colonial rule in late 19th century. They established farms and businesses. The overwhelming majority of these, however, left Algeria during and following the war for independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files_156/north-africa_5493/france-and-maghreb_5495/an-enhanced-partnership-with-the-maghreb-20.03.07_8821.html |title=France and Maghreb \u2013 An enhanced partnership with the Maghreb (March 20, 2007) |access-date=2007-07-11 |website=French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs }}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Imedghasen.jpg|thumb|right|The [[mausoleum]] of [[Madghacen]]]]\nThe original religions of the peoples of the Maghreb seem<ref>[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/grasshoff.html]</ref> to have been based in and related to fertility cults of a strong [[Matriarchal religion|matriarchal pantheon]]. This theory is based on the social and linguistic structures of the [[Amazigh]] cultures that antedated all Egyptian and eastern Asian, northern Mediterranean, and European influences.\n\nHistoric records of religion in the Maghreb region show its gradual inclusion in the Classical World, with coastal colonies established first by Phoenicians, some Greeks, and later extensive conquest and colonization by the Romans. By the 2nd century of the common era, the area had become a center of Phoenician-speaking Christianity. Its bishops spoke and wrote in [[Punic]], and Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] was noted by his local accent. Roman settlers and Romanized populations converted to Christianity. The region produced figures such as Christian church writer [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 \u2013 c. 202); and Christian martyrs or leading figures such as [[Perpetua|Perpetua and Felicity]] (martyrs, c. 200 CE); [[Cyprian|St. Cyprian of Carthage]] (+ 258); [[Monica (Christian saint)|St. Monica]]; her son the philosopher [[St. Augustine]], Bishop of Hippo I (+ 430) (1); and [[Julia of Corsica|St. Julia of Carthage]] (5th century).\n\n===Islam===\n[[File:Kabylie Christian family.jpg|thumb|upright|Christian [[Berbers|Berber]] family from [[Kabylia]]]]\n[[Islam]] arrived in 647 and challenged the domination of Christianity. The first permanent foothold of Islam was the founding in 667 of the city of [[Kairouan]], in present-day [[Tunisia]]. [[Carthage]] fell to Muslims in 698 and the remainder of the region fell by 709. Islamization proceeded slowly. \n\nFrom the end of the 7th century, over a period of more than 400 years, the region's peoples converted to Islam. Many left during this time for Italy, although surviving letters showed correspondence from regional Christians to Rome up until the 12th century. Christianity was still a living faith. Although there were numerous conversions after the conquest, Muslims did not become a majority until some time late in the 9th centur. During the 10th century, Islam became by far the dominant religion in the region.<ref>''Staying Roman,'' Jonathan Conant, pp.&nbsp;362\u2013368, 2012</ref> Christian bishoprics and dioceses continued to be active, and continued their relations with the Christian Church of Rome. As late as the reign of Pope [[Benedict VII]] (974\u2013983), a new [[Archdiocese of Carthage|Archbishop of Carthage]] was consecrated. From the 10th century, Christianity declined in the region.<ref>Insoll, T.

[[Pope Gregory VII]] (1073\u201385) consecrated a new bishop for Hippo. Christianity seems to have suffered several shocks that led to its demise. First, many upper-class, urban-dwelling, Latin-speaking Christians left for Europe after the Muslim conquest. The second major influence were the large-scale conversions to Islam from the end of the 9th century. Many Christians of a much reduced community departed in the mid-11th century, and remnants were evacuated in the 12th by the Norman rulers of Sicily. The Latin-African language lingered a while longer.\n\nThere was a small but thriving Jewish community, as well as a small Christian community. Most Muslims follow the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. Small [[Ibadi]] communities remain in some areas. A strong tradition of venerating [[marabout]]s and saints' tombs is found throughout regions inhabited by Berbers. This practice was also common among the Jews of the region. Any map of the region demonstrates the tradition by the proliferation of \"[[Sidi]]\"s, showing places named after the marabouts. This tradition has declined through the 20th century. A network of ''[[zaouia]]s'' traditionally helped teach basic literacy and knowledge of Islam in rural regions.\n\nCommunities of Christians, mostly [[Catholics]] and [[Protestant]], persist in [[Algeria]] (100,000\u2013380,000),<ref>Deeb, Mary Jane. \"Religious minorities\", ''Algeria (Country Study)''.

They passed this identification on from father to son. Their tight-knit pan-Maghreb community had the ability to use social sanctions as a credible alternative to legal recourse, which was weak at the time anyway.

The Y-DNA Haplogroups [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] and [[haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] make up the vast majority of the genetic markers of the populations of the Maghreb. Haplogroup [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] is the most widespread among Maghrebi groups, especially the downstream lineage of [[E-M81|E1b1b1b1a]], which is typical of the indigenous Berbers of North-West Africa. Haplogroup J is more indicative of Middle East origins, and has its highest distribution among populations in Arabia and the Levant. Due to the distribution of [[E-M81]](E1b1b1b1a), which has reached its highest documented levels in the world at 95\u2013100% in some populations of the Maghreb, it has often been termed the \"Berber marker\" in the scientific literature.

The traditional definition of the Maghreb, which restricted it to the Atlas Mountains and the coastal plains of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, was expanded by the inclusion of Mauritania and the disputed territory of Western Sahara.\n\nDuring the era of [[Al-Andalus]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (711\u20131492), the Maghreb's inhabitants, the Muslim Berbers or [[Maghrebi]], were known by Europeans as \"[[Moors]]\",<ref>\"The Moors were simply Maghrebis, inhabitants of the Maghreb, the western part of the Islamic world, that extends from Spain to Tunisia, and represents a homogeneous cultural entity\", [[Titus Burckhardt]], ''Moorish Culture in Spain''.

It often also included the territory of eastern Libya, but not modern Mauritania. As recently as the late 19th century, the term \"Maghreb\" was used to refer to the [[Western Mediterranean]] region of coastal North Africa in general, and to Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, in particular.<ref name=Reclus>[[Elis\u00e9e Reclus]], ''Africa'', edited by [[A.

This period was followed by one of the [[Roman Empire]]'s rule or influence. The Germanic [[Vandal]]s invaded after that, followed by the equally brief re-establishment of a weak Roman rule by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Islamic [[Caliphates]] came to power under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the [[Fatimid Caliphate]].

These trade relations can be dated at least to the [[Phoenicians]] in the 1st millennium BC. (The Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] was founded, according to tradition, in what is now Tunisia circa 800 BC).\n\nThe [[Berbers]] predominantly constructed their coastal ports and cities. Later, some Phoenicians and Carthaginians arrived for trade. The main Berber and Phoenician settlements centered in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] ([[Carthage]], [[Utica, Tunisia]]) along the North African [[littoral]], between the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and the Libyan coast east of ancient [[Cyrenaica]]. They dominated the trade and intercourse of the [[Western Mediterranean]] for centuries. The Carthage defeat in the [[Punic Wars]] in 206 BC allowed Rome to establish the [[Province of Africa]] and control many of these ports. Rome eventually took control of the entire Maghreb north of the Atlas Mountains. Rome was greatly helped by the defection of King [[Massinissa]] and Carthage's eastern Numidian [[Massylii]] client-allies. Some of the most mountainous regions, such as the Moroccan [[Rif]], remained outside Rome's control. The pressure put on the [[Western Roman Empire]] by the [[Barbarian invasions]] (the [[Vandals]] and [[Hispania|Spain]]) in the 5th century reduced Roman control and led to the establishment of the [[Vandal Kingdom]]in 430 A.D. with its capital at Carthage. A century later, the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] sent a force under General [[Belisarius]] that [[Vandalic War|succeeded in destroying]] the Vandal Kingdom. [[Exarchate of Carthage|Byzantine rule]] lasted for 150 years. The Berbers contested outside-the-area control. After the advent of [[Islam]] in the 640s\u2013700 AD period, Arabs took control of the entire region.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{main|Ifriqiya|Umayyad Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphate|Idrisid dynasty|Almoravid dynasty|Kingdom of Africa|Almohad Caliphate|Hafsid dynasty|Marinid dynasty|Ziyyanid dynasty|Wattasid dynasty}}\n[[File:Kairouan Mosque Courtyard.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], founded by the Arab general Uqba Ibn Nafi (in 670), is the oldest mosque in the Maghreb city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&pg=PA128&dq=kairouan+oldest+mosque+maghreb&hl=fr&ei=YDg8TbPsH8vAswbDhszzBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam, Language and Meaning: Commemorative Edition'', World Wisdom, Inc, 2009, page 128]</ref>]]\n\nThe Arabs reached the Maghreb in early [[Umayyad]] times. Islamic Berber kingdoms such as the [[Almohad]]s expansion and the spread of [[Islam]] contributed to the development of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. While restricted due to the cost and dangers, the trade was highly profitable. Commodities traded included such goods as salt, gold, ivory, and [[Arab slave trade|enslaved persons from sub-Saharan regions]]. Arab control over the Maghreb was quite weak. Various Islamic variations, such as the [[Ibadi]]s and the [[Shia]], were adopted by some Berbers, often leading to scorning of [[Caliph]]al control in favour of their own interpretation of Islam.\n\nAs a result of the invasion of the [[Banu Hilal]] Arabs, the [[Arabic language]] and dialects spread slowly without eliminating Berber. These Arabs had been set upon the Berbers by the [[Fatimid]]s in punishment for their [[Zirid]] former Berber clients who defected and abandoned [[Shiism]] in the 12th century. Throughout this period, the Berber world most often was divided into three states, roughly corresponding to modern Morocco, western Algeria, and eastern Algeria and [[Tunisia]]. The region was occasionally briefly unified, as under the [[Almohad]] Berber empire, and briefly under the [[Marinid]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{main|Barbary Coast|Saadi dynasty|Alaouite dynasty|Ottoman Algeria|Ottoman Tunisia|Ottoman Tripolitania}}\n[[File:Guillaume Delisle North West Africa 1707.jpg|thumb|1707 map of northwest Africa by [[Guillaume Delisle]], including the Maghreb\nAfter the Middle Ages, the [[Ottoman Empire]] loosely controlled the area east of Morocco.]]\n\n===Modern history===\n{{further|Spanish Morocco|Spanish Sahara|French protectorate of Morocco|French Algeria|French Protectorate of Tunisia|Italian Libya}}\n{{further|North African Campaign (World War I)|North African Campaign|Western Desert Campaign}}\n{{further|Western Sahara War|Algerian War of Independence|History of Algeria since 1962|History of modern Tunisia|Kingdom of Libya|Libya under Gaddafi}}\nAfter the 19th century, areas of the Maghreb were colonized by [[France]], [[Spain]] and later [[Italy]].\n\nToday, more than two and a half million Maghrebi immigrants live in France, many from Algeria and Morocco.

In northern coastal towns, in particular, several waves of European immigrants influenced the population in the Medieval era. Most notable were the [[morisco]]s and [[muladi]]es, that is, the indigenous [[Spaniards]] (Moors) who were forcibly converted to Catholicism and later were expelled, together with ethnic Arab and Berber Muslims, from the [[Reconquista|Spanish Catholic Reconquista]].{{awkward|date=April 2020}} Other European contributions included the French, Italian, and English crew and passengers taken captive by the [[Barbary corsairs|corsairs]].

These were later augmented by Sephardic Jews from Spain and Portugal who, fleeing the Spanish Catholic Inquisition of the 15th and 16th centuries, established a presence in North Africa. They settled primarily in the urban trading centers. Many Jews from Spain emigrated to North America from the Maghreb in the 19th and early 20th centuries, or to France and Israel later in the 20th century after the latter was founded.\n\nAnother significant group are Turks, who migrated with the expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A large [[Kouloughli|ethnic Turkish]] population exists, particularly in Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.\n\nSub-Saharan Africans joined the population mix during centuries of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. Traders and slaves went to the Maghreb from the [[Sahel]] region. On the Saharan southern edge of the Maghreb are small communities of black populations, sometimes called [[Haratine]]. They appear to have descended from black populations who inhabited the Sahara during its last wet period and then migrated north as it turned to desert.\n\nIn Algeria especially, a large European minority, known as the \"[[pied noir]]s\", immigrated to the region, settling under French colonial rule in late 19th century. They established farms and businesses. The overwhelming majority of these, however, left Algeria during and following the war for independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files_156/north-africa_5493/france-and-maghreb_5495/an-enhanced-partnership-with-the-maghreb-20.03.07_8821.html |title=France and Maghreb \u2013 An enhanced partnership with the Maghreb (March 20, 2007) |access-date=2007-07-11 |website=French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs }}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Imedghasen.jpg|thumb|right|The [[mausoleum]] of [[Madghacen]]]]\nThe original religions of the peoples of the Maghreb seem<ref>[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/grasshoff.html]</ref> to have been based in and related to fertility cults of a strong [[Matriarchal religion|matriarchal pantheon]]. This theory is based on the social and linguistic structures of the [[Amazigh]] cultures that antedated all Egyptian and eastern Asian, northern Mediterranean, and European influences.\n\nHistoric records of religion in the Maghreb region show its gradual inclusion in the Classical World, with coastal colonies established first by Phoenicians, some Greeks, and later extensive conquest and colonization by the Romans. By the 2nd century of the common era, the area had become a center of Phoenician-speaking Christianity. Its bishops spoke and wrote in [[Punic]], and Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] was noted by his local accent. Roman settlers and Romanized populations converted to Christianity. The region produced figures such as Christian church writer [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 \u2013 c. 202); and Christian martyrs or leading figures such as [[Perpetua|Perpetua and Felicity]] (martyrs, c. 200 CE); [[Cyprian|St. Cyprian of Carthage]] (+ 258); [[Monica (Christian saint)|St. Monica]]; her son the philosopher [[St. Augustine]], Bishop of Hippo I (+ 430) (1); and [[Julia of Corsica|St. Julia of Carthage]] (5th century).\n\n===Islam===\n[[File:Kabylie Christian family.jpg|thumb|upright|Christian [[Berbers|Berber]] family from [[Kabylia]]]]\n[[Islam]] arrived in 647 and challenged the domination of Christianity. The first permanent foothold of Islam was the founding in 667 of the city of [[Kairouan]], in present-day [[Tunisia]]. [[Carthage]] fell to Muslims in 698 and the remainder of the region fell by 709. Islamization proceeded slowly. \n\nFrom the end of the 7th century, over a period of more than 400 years, the region's peoples converted to Islam. Many left during this time for Italy, although surviving letters showed correspondence from regional Christians to Rome up until the 12th century. Christianity was still a living faith. Although there were numerous conversions after the conquest, Muslims did not become a majority until some time late in the 9th centur. During the 10th century, Islam became by far the dominant religion in the region.<ref>''Staying Roman,'' Jonathan Conant, pp.&nbsp;362\u2013368, 2012</ref> Christian bishoprics and dioceses continued to be active, and continued their relations with the Christian Church of Rome.

[[Pope Gregory VII]] (1073\u201385) consecrated a new bishop for Hippo. Christianity seems to have suffered several shocks that led to its demise. First, many upper-class, urban-dwelling, Latin-speaking Christians left for Europe after the Muslim conquest. The second major influence were the large-scale conversions to Islam from the end of the 9th century. Many Christians of a much reduced community departed in the mid-11th century, and remnants were evacuated in the 12th by the Norman rulers of Sicily. The Latin-African language lingered a while longer.\n\nThere was a small but thriving Jewish community, as well as a small Christian community. Most Muslims follow the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. Small [[Ibadi]] communities remain in some areas. A strong tradition of venerating [[marabout]]s and saints' tombs is found throughout regions inhabited by Berbers. This practice was also common among the Jews of the region. Any map of the region demonstrates the tradition by the proliferation of \"[[Sidi]]\"s, showing places named after the marabouts. This tradition has declined through the 20th century. A network of ''[[zaouia]]s'' traditionally helped teach basic literacy and knowledge of Islam in rural regions.\n\nCommunities of Christians, mostly [[Catholics]] and [[Protestant]], persist in [[Algeria]] (100,000\u2013380,000),<ref>Deeb, Mary Jane. \"Religious minorities\", ''Algeria (Country Study)''.

Over the following two or three centuries, such Jewish traders became known as the Maghribi, a distinctive social group who traveled throughout the Mediterranean world. They passed this identification on from father to son. Their tight-knit pan-Maghreb community had the ability to use social sanctions as a credible alternative to legal recourse, which was weak at the time anyway. This unique institutional alternative permitted the Maghribis to very successfully participate in Mediterranean trade.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Avner Greif | title = Contract Enforceability and Economic Institutions in Early Trade: The Maghribi Traders' Coalition | version = | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] in its journal [[American Economic Review]] | date= June 1993 | url = http://www.stanford.edu/~avner/Greif_Papers/SSRNAUG202008.pdf | access-date = 2007-07-11 | author-link = Avner Greif }}.

The Maghreb's variations in elevation, rainfall, temperature, and soils give rise to distinct communities of plants and animals. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) identifies several distinct [[ecoregion]]s in the Maghreb.\n\n====Mediterranean Maghreb====\n[[File:Chamaerops humilis argentea1.jpg|thumb|[[Chamaerops|Dwarf fan palm]], grown in Maghrebi countries]]\nThe portions of the Maghreb between the [[Atlas Mountains]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], along with coastal [[Tripolitania]] and [[Cyrenaica]] in Libya, are home to [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]]. These ecoregions share many species of plants and animals with other portions of [[Mediterranean Basin]]. The southern extent of the Mediterranean Maghreb corresponds with the {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Contour line#Precipitation and air moisture|isohyet]], or the southern range of the [[Olive|European Olive]] ''(Olea europea)''<ref>Dallman, Peter R.

Its central part is hyper-arid and supports little plant or animal life, but the northern portion of the desert receives occasional winter rains, while the strip along the Atlantic coast receives moisture from marine fog, which nourishes a greater variety of plants and animals. The northern edge of the Sahara corresponds to the 100&nbsp;mm isohyet, which is also the northern range of the [[date palm]] ''(Phoenix dactylifera)''.<ref name=\"Wickens\"/>\n* [[North Saharan steppe and woodlands]]: This ecoregion lies along the northern edge of the Sahara, next to the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] ecoregions of the Mediterranean Maghreb and Cyrenaica. Winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form a transition between the [[Mediterranean climate]] regions to the north and the hyper-arid Sahara proper to the south.

Vegetation is rare, and this ecoregion consists mostly of sand dunes ''([[erg (landform)|erg]])'', stone plateaus ''([[hamada]])'', gravel plains ''([[Desert pavement|reg]])'', dry valleys ''([[wadi]])'', and salt flats. It covers 4,639,900 square km (1,791,500 square miles) of Algeria, [[Chad]], Egypt, Libya, [[Mali]], Mauritania, [[Niger]], and [[Sudan]].<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1327|name=Sahara desert|access-date=December 31, 2007}}</ref>\n* [[Saharan halophytics]]: Seasonally flooded saline depressions in the Maghreb are home to [[halophytic]], or salt-adapted, plant communities. The Saharan halophytics cover 54,000 square km (20,800 square miles), including [[Tunisian salt lakes]] of central Tunisia, [[Chott Melghir]] in Algeria, and other areas of Egypt, Algeria, Mauritania, and Western Sahara.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0905|name=Saharan halophytics|access-date=December 31, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:African Dinner-01.jpg|right|thumb|Traditional Maghrebi cuisine]]\n{{further|Moroccan cuisine}} {{further|Algerian cuisine}} {{further|Tunisian cuisine}}\n\nThe countries of the Maghreb share many cultural traditions. Among these is a culinary tradition that [[Habib Bourguiba]] defined as Western Arab, where [[couscous]] is the staple food, as opposed to Eastern Arab, where white rice is the staple food. In terms of food, similarities beyond the starches are found throughout the Arab world.\n\n==Genetics of the Maghreb population==\nThe Y-chromosome genetic structure of the Maghreb population seems to be modulated chiefly by geography. The Y-DNA Haplogroups [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] and [[haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] make up the vast majority of the genetic markers of the populations of the Maghreb. Haplogroup [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] is the most widespread among Maghrebi groups, especially the downstream lineage of [[E-M81|E1b1b1b1a]], which is typical of the indigenous Berbers of North-West Africa. Haplogroup J is more indicative of Middle East origins, and has its highest distribution among populations in Arabia and the Levant. Due to the distribution of [[E-M81]](E1b1b1b1a), which has reached its highest documented levels in the world at 95\u2013100% in some populations of the Maghreb, it has often been termed the \"Berber marker\" in the scientific literature.

Since the first contact of the Portuguese with the Japanese and Chinese dates also from the sixteenth century, it is possible that some were brought back to Europe, as was probably the case with other species like the ''hachiya'' persimmon variety.\n\n''Eriobotrya japonica'' was again described in Europe by [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], as ''Mespilus japonica'' in 1780, and was relocated to the genus ''Eriobotrya'' (from Greek ''\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf'' \"wool\" and ''\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03ce\u03bd'' \"cluster\") by [[John Lindley]], who published these changes in 1821. \n\nThe most common variety in Portugal is the late ripening Tanaka, where it is popular in gardens and backyards, but not commercially produced. In northern Portugal it is also popularly called magn\u00f3rio/magn\u00f3lio, probably something to do with the French botanist Pierre Magnol. In Spain, the fruits are similarly called \"n\u00edsperos\" and are commercially explored, Spain being the largest producer worldwide, after China, with  41,487t annually, half of which is destined to export markets.\n\n==Cultivation==\nOver 800 loquat [[cultivar]]s exist in Asia. [[Self-fertile]] variants include the 'Gold Nugget' and 'Mogi' cultivars.<ref name=Staub/> The loquat is easy to grow in subtropical to mild temperate climates where it is often primarily grown as an [[ornamental plant]], especially for its sweet-scented flowers, and secondarily for its delicious fruit.

It is popular in the [[Eastern United States]], as well as the [[Southern United States|American South]].\n\n[[Image:BlossomingLoquat.jpg|thumb|Loquat in flower.

Since the first contact of the Portuguese with the Japanese and Chinese dates also from the sixteenth century, it is possible that some were brought back to Europe, as was probably the case with other species like the ''hachiya'' persimmon variety.\n\n''Eriobotrya japonica'' was again described in Europe by [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], as ''Mespilus japonica'' in 1780, and was relocated to the genus ''Eriobotrya'' (from Greek ''\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf'' \"wool\" and ''\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03ce\u03bd'' \"cluster\") by [[John Lindley]], who published these changes in 1821. \n\nThe most common variety in Portugal is the late ripening Tanaka, where it is popular in gardens and backyards, but not commercially produced. In northern Portugal it is also popularly called magn\u00f3rio/magn\u00f3lio, probably something to do with the French botanist Pierre Magnol. In Spain, the fruits are similarly called \"n\u00edsperos\" and are commercially explored, Spain being the largest producer worldwide, after China, with  41,487t annually, half of which is destined to export markets.\n\n==Cultivation==\nOver 800 loquat [[cultivar]]s exist in Asia. [[Self-fertile]] variants include the 'Gold Nugget' and 'Mogi' cultivars.<ref name=Staub/> The loquat is easy to grow in subtropical to mild temperate climates where it is often primarily grown as an [[ornamental plant]], especially for its sweet-scented flowers, and secondarily for its delicious fruit. The boldly textured foliage adds a tropical look to gardens, contrasting well with many other plants. It is popular in the [[Eastern United States]], as well as the [[Southern United States|American South]].\n\n[[Image:BlossomingLoquat.jpg|thumb|Loquat in flower.

The fruits are also commonly used to make [[Fruit preserves#Jam|jam]], [[Fruit preserves#Jelly|jelly]] and [[chutney]], and are often served poached in light syrup. Firm, slightly immature fruits are best for making pies or tarts.\n\nThe fruit is sometimes canned or processed into confections. The waste ratio is 30 percent or more, due to the seed size.\n[[File:Ripe and unripe loquats.jpg|thumb|Ripe and unripe loquats]]\n\n==Alcoholic beverages==\nLoquats can also be used to make light wine.

For most of the time since then, Australia\u2013New Guinea remained a continuous landmass. When the [[last glacial period]] ended in about 10,000 BC, rising sea levels formed [[Bass Strait]], separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating New Guinea, the [[Aru Islands]], and the Australian mainland.\n\nA northern arc consisting of the [[New Guinea Highlands]], the [[Raja Ampat Islands]], and [[Halmahera]] was uplifted by the northward migration of Australia and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]].

During this time, the continent experienced numerous changes in climate, but the overall trend was towards greater aridity. When [[South America]] eventually separated from Antarctica, the development of the cold [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] changed weather patterns across the world. For Australia\u2013New Guinea, it brought a marked intensification of the drying trend. The great inland seas and lakes dried out. Much of the long-established broad-leaf [[deciduous]] forest began to give way to the distinctive hard-leaved [[sclerophyllous]] plants that characterise the modern Australian landscape. \n\nTypical Southern Hemisphere flora include the [[conifer]]s ''[[Podocarpus]]'' (eastern Australia and New Guinea), the rainforest emergents ''[[Araucaria]]'' (eastern Australia and New Guinea), ''[[Nothofagus]]'' (New Guinea and [[Tasmania]]) and ''[[Agathis]]'' (northern [[Queensland]] and New Guinea), as well as [[tree fern]]s and several species of ''Eucalyptus''. Prominent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to [[aridity]] and fire which include [[sclerophyll|scleromorphy]] and [[serotiny]]. These adaptations are common in species from the large and well-known families [[Proteaceae]] (''[[Banksia]]''), [[Myrtaceae]] (''[[Eucalyptus]]'' or gum trees, ''[[Melaleuca]]s'' and ''[[Callistemon]]s''), [[Fabaceae]] (''[[Acacia]]''s or wattles and ''[[Casuarina]]'' or she-oaks) and ''[[Grevillea]]s'', which are typically found in the Australian mainland. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many [[tropical rainforest]] species with origins in Asia, such as ''[[Castanopsis acuminatissima]],'' ''[[Lithocarpus]]'' spp., [[Elaeocarpaceae|elaeocarps]], and [[Lauraceae|laurels]], together with typically Australasian flora. In the New Guinean highlands, conifers such as ''[[Dacrycarpus]], [[Dacrydium]], [[Papuacedrus]]'' and ''[[Libocedrus]]'' are present.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/samples/australiaburningsample.pdf |title=Australia Burning: Fire Ecology, Policy and Management Issues |publisher=CSIRO Publishing}}</ref>\n\nFor many species, the primary refuge was the relatively cool and well-watered [[Great Dividing Range]]. Even today, pockets of remnant vegetation remain in the cool uplands, some species not much changed from the Gondwanan forms of 60 or 90 million years ago. Eventually, the Australia\u2013New Guinea tectonic plate collided with the [[Eurasian plate]] to the north. The collision caused the northern part of the continent to buckle upwards, forming the high and rugged mountains of New Guinea and, by reverse (downwards) buckling, the [[Torres Strait]] that now separates the two main landmasses. The collision also pushed up the islands of [[Wallacea]], which served as island 'stepping-stones' that allowed plants from [[Southeast Asia]]'s rainforests to colonise New Guinea, and some plants from Australia\u2013New Guinea to move into Southeast Asia. The ocean straits between the islands were narrow enough to allow plant dispersal, but served as an effective barrier to exchange of land mammals between Australia\u2013New Guinea and Asia.\n\nAmong the fungi, the remarkable association between ''[[Cyttaria]]'' ''gunnii'' (one of the \"golf-ball\" fungi) and its associated trees in the genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'' is evidence of that drift: the only other places where this association is known are New Zealand and southern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Korf |first=R.

There were three main reasons for the enormous diversity that developed in animal, fungal and plant life.\n\n* While much of the rest of the world underwent significant cooling and thus loss of species diversity, Australia\u2013New Guinea was drifting north at such a pace that the overall global cooling effect was roughly equalled by its gradual movement toward the [[equator]]. [[Temperature]]s in Australia\u2013New Guinea, in other words, remained reasonably constant for a very long time, and a vast number of different animal, fungal and plant species were able to evolve to fit particular [[ecological niche]]s.\n* Because the continent was more isolated than any other, very few outside species arrived to colonise, and unique native forms developed unimpeded.\n* Finally, despite the fact that the continent was already very old and thus relatively infertile, there are dispersed areas of high fertility. Where other continents had [[Volcanism|volcanic]] activity and/or massive [[Glacier|glaciation]] events to turn over fresh, unleached [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s rich in [[mineral]]s, the rocks and [[soil]]s of Australia\u2013New Guinea were left largely untouched except by gradual [[erosion]] and deep [[weathering]]. In general, fertile soils produce a profusion of life, and a relatively large number of species/level of biodiversity. This is because where [[nutrient]]s are plentiful, competition is largely a matter of outcompeting rival species, leaving great scope for innovative [[co-evolution]] as is witnessed in tropical, fertile ecosystems. In contrast, infertile soils tend to induce competition on an abiotic basis meaning individuals all face constant environmental pressures, leaving less scope for divergent evolution, a process instrumental in creating new species.\n\nAlthough New Guinea is the most northerly part of the continent, and could be expected to be the most [[tropical climate|tropical]] in climate, the altitude of the New Guinea highlands is such that a great many animals and plants that were once common across Australia\u2013New Guinea now survive only in the tropical highlands where they are severely threatened by [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Australia}}\nIn New Guinea, the climate is mostly [[monsoonal]] (December to March), southeast monsoon (May to October), and [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest]] with slight seasonal temperature variation. In lower altitudes, the temperature is around 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (27&nbsp;\u00b0C) year round. But the higher altitudes, such as [[Mendi]], are constantly around 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C) with cool lows nearing 52&nbsp;\u00b0F (11&nbsp;\u00b0C), with abundant rainfall and high humidity. The [[New Guinea Highlands]] are one of the few regions close to the [[equator]] that experience [[snowfall]], which occurs in the most elevated parts of the mainland. Some areas in the island experience an extraordinary amount of precipitation, averaging roughly {{convert|4500|mm}} of rainfall annually.\n\nThe Australian landmass's climate is mostly [[desert]] or [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], with the southern coastal corners having a [[Temperateness|temperate]] climate, such as [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] and [[humid subtropical]] climate in the east coast and [[Mediterranean climate]] in the west.

Prominent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to [[aridity]] and fire which include [[sclerophyll|scleromorphy]] and [[serotiny]]. These adaptations are common in species from the large and well-known families [[Proteaceae]] (''[[Banksia]]''), [[Myrtaceae]] (''[[Eucalyptus]]'' or gum trees, ''[[Melaleuca]]s'' and ''[[Callistemon]]s''), [[Fabaceae]] (''[[Acacia]]''s or wattles and ''[[Casuarina]]'' or she-oaks) and ''[[Grevillea]]s'', which are typically found in the Australian mainland. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many [[tropical rainforest]] species with origins in Asia, such as ''[[Castanopsis acuminatissima]],'' ''[[Lithocarpus]]'' spp., [[Elaeocarpaceae|elaeocarps]], and [[Lauraceae|laurels]], together with typically Australasian flora. In the New Guinean highlands, conifers such as ''[[Dacrycarpus]], [[Dacrydium]], [[Papuacedrus]]'' and ''[[Libocedrus]]'' are present.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/samples/australiaburningsample.pdf |title=Australia Burning: Fire Ecology, Policy and Management Issues |publisher=CSIRO Publishing}}</ref>\n\nFor many species, the primary refuge was the relatively cool and well-watered [[Great Dividing Range]]. Even today, pockets of remnant vegetation remain in the cool uplands, some species not much changed from the Gondwanan forms of 60 or 90 million years ago. Eventually, the Australia\u2013New Guinea tectonic plate collided with the [[Eurasian plate]] to the north. The collision caused the northern part of the continent to buckle upwards, forming the high and rugged mountains of New Guinea and, by reverse (downwards) buckling, the [[Torres Strait]] that now separates the two main landmasses. The collision also pushed up the islands of [[Wallacea]], which served as island 'stepping-stones' that allowed plants from [[Southeast Asia]]'s rainforests to colonise New Guinea, and some plants from Australia\u2013New Guinea to move into Southeast Asia. The ocean straits between the islands were narrow enough to allow plant dispersal, but served as an effective barrier to exchange of land mammals between Australia\u2013New Guinea and Asia.\n\nAmong the fungi, the remarkable association between ''[[Cyttaria]]'' ''gunnii'' (one of the \"golf-ball\" fungi) and its associated trees in the genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'' is evidence of that drift: the only other places where this association is known are New Zealand and southern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Korf |first=R.

[[Marsupial]]s and [[monotreme]]s also existed on other continents, but only in Australia\u2013New Guinea did they out-compete the [[Placentalia|placental]] [[mammals]] and come to dominate. New Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: monotremes, three orders of marsupials, [[rodent]]s and [[bat]]s; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has a rich diversity of [[coral]] life and 1,200 species of [[fish]] have been found.

There were three main reasons for the enormous diversity that developed in animal, fungal and plant life.\n\n* While much of the rest of the world underwent significant cooling and thus loss of species diversity, Australia\u2013New Guinea was drifting north at such a pace that the overall global cooling effect was roughly equalled by its gradual movement toward the [[equator]]. [[Temperature]]s in Australia\u2013New Guinea, in other words, remained reasonably constant for a very long time, and a vast number of different animal, fungal and plant species were able to evolve to fit particular [[ecological niche]]s.\n* Because the continent was more isolated than any other, very few outside species arrived to colonise, and unique native forms developed unimpeded.\n* Finally, despite the fact that the continent was already very old and thus relatively infertile, there are dispersed areas of high fertility. Where other continents had [[Volcanism|volcanic]] activity and/or massive [[Glacier|glaciation]] events to turn over fresh, unleached [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s rich in [[mineral]]s, the rocks and [[soil]]s of Australia\u2013New Guinea were left largely untouched except by gradual [[erosion]] and deep [[weathering]]. In general, fertile soils produce a profusion of life, and a relatively large number of species/level of biodiversity. This is because where [[nutrient]]s are plentiful, competition is largely a matter of outcompeting rival species, leaving great scope for innovative [[co-evolution]] as is witnessed in tropical, fertile ecosystems. In contrast, infertile soils tend to induce competition on an abiotic basis meaning individuals all face constant environmental pressures, leaving less scope for divergent evolution, a process instrumental in creating new species.\n\nAlthough New Guinea is the most northerly part of the continent, and could be expected to be the most [[tropical climate|tropical]] in climate, the altitude of the New Guinea highlands is such that a great many animals and plants that were once common across Australia\u2013New Guinea now survive only in the tropical highlands where they are severely threatened by [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Australia}}\nIn New Guinea, the climate is mostly [[monsoonal]] (December to March), southeast monsoon (May to October), and [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest]] with slight seasonal temperature variation. In lower altitudes, the temperature is around 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (27&nbsp;\u00b0C) year round. But the higher altitudes, such as [[Mendi]], are constantly around 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C) with cool lows nearing 52&nbsp;\u00b0F (11&nbsp;\u00b0C), with abundant rainfall and high humidity. The [[New Guinea Highlands]] are one of the few regions close to the [[equator]] that experience [[snowfall]], which occurs in the most elevated parts of the mainland. Some areas in the island experience an extraordinary amount of precipitation, averaging roughly {{convert|4500|mm}} of rainfall annually.\n\nThe Australian landmass's climate is mostly [[desert]] or [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], with the southern coastal corners having a [[Temperateness|temperate]] climate, such as [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] and [[humid subtropical]] climate in the east coast and [[Mediterranean climate]] in the west. The northern parts of the country have a [[tropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclim.html|title=BOM \u2013 Climate of Australia|first=National Climate|last=Centre|website=pandora.nla.gov.au|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclim.html|archivedate=17 March 2009}}</ref> [[Snow]] falls frequently on the [[Great Dividing Range|highlands]] near the east coast, in the states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]] and in the [[Australian Capital Territory]].

The choir sings with a pure, flexible, well-blended sound, and it performs with exuberance and a youthful sense of discovery. Critics throughout the world have praised its accurate intonation, clear diction, and the high level of enthusiasm and commitment that are among the hallmarks of the choir's music-making.\n\nThe choir has traveled extensively and toured dozens of countries in Europe, North America and Asia, as well as Israel and collaborated with renowned conductors such as [[T\u00f5nu Kaljuste]], [[Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4]], [[Lukas Foss]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Heltay]], [[Robert King (conductor)|Robert King]], [[Timothy Brown (conductor)|Timothy Brown]], Gustav Sj\u00f6kvist, Willi Gohl, Hansruedi Willisegger, Johan Dujick, Petri Sakari and [[Thomas Ad\u00e9s]].

Over 100 works have been composed especially for the choir, including works by virtually all of Iceland's leading composers. Apart from its close association with native composers, the choir has collaborated with foreign artist such as [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]], [[John Cage]] and [[Vagn Holmboe]] in the first Icelandic performances of their works. Arvo P\u00e4rt was so impressed with the choir's performance of his [[Te Deum (P\u00e4rt)|Te Deum]] in 1998 that he composed a choral work dedicated to \u00deorger\u00f0ur Ing\u00f3lfsd\u00f3ttir, Which was the son of..., which was premi\u00e8red in 2000.\n\nThe choir was awarded ''Performer of the year'' at the 2002 [[Icelandic Music Awards]] and has released several [[Compact disc|CDs]] and [[gramophone record]]s.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n*1982: Mattheusarpass\u00eda/ ''St Matthew Passion'' <small>(credited to P\u00f3l\u00fdf\u00f3nk\u00f3rinn, Hamrahl\u00ed\u00f0ark\u00f3rinn, K\u00f3r \u00d6ldut\u00fanssk\u00f3la og 2 kammersveitir)</small>\n*1988: Kve\u00f0i\u00f0 \u00ed bjargi/ ''Invocation from the Rock''\n*1990: Turtil d\u00fafan, jar\u00f0aberi\u00f0 og \u00falfaldalestin/ ''The Turtle Dove, the Strawberry and the Desert Caravan''\n*1993: \u00cdslensk \u00fej\u00f3\u00f0l\u00f6g/ ''Icelandic Folk Songs''\n*1996: \u00cdslenskir j\u00f3las\u00f6ngvar og Mar\u00edukv\u00e6\u00f0i/ ''Icelandic Christmas Songs and Hymns to the Virgin''\n*2002: Vorkv\u00e6\u00f0i um \u00cdsland/ ''Icelandic Spring Poem''\n*2003: Mans\u00f6ngur um \u00d3lafs r\u00edmu Gr\u00e6nlendings/ ''Ballad of Olaf the Greenlander''\n*2008: \u00deorkell/ ''Choral Music by [[\u00deorkell Sigurbj\u00f6rnsson]]''\n*2009: J\u00f3lasagan/ ''The Christmas Story''\n*2013: Dj\u00fapsins r\u00f3/ ''Calm of the Deep'' <small>(with [[Nordic Affect]])</small>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n*[https://hamrahlidarkorarnir.wordpress.com/about-the-hamrahlid-choir/ Webpage of the choir]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hamrahlid Choir}}\n[[Category:Icelandic choirs]]\n[[Category:University choirs]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1981]]\n[[Category:1981 establishments in Iceland]]\n", "text_old": "'''The Hamrahlid Choir''' or '''Hamrahl\u00ed\u00f0ark\u00f3rinn''' as it is called in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] was founded in 1981 by \u00deorger\u00f0ur Ing\u00f3lfsd\u00f3ttir, who remains its [[Conducting|conductor]].

At their most basic, cameras are sealed boxes (the camera body) with a small hole (the [[aperture]]) that let light in to capture an image on a light-sensitive surface (usually [[photographic film]] or a [[digital sensor]]). Cameras have various mechanisms to control how the light falls onto the light-sensitive surface. [[Lens]]es focus the light entering the camera, the size of the aperture can be widened or narrowed to let more or less light into the camera, and a [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] mechanism determines the amount of time the photo-sensitive surface is exposed to the light.\n\nThe still image camera is the main instrument in the art of photography and captured images may be reproduced later as a part of the process of photography, [[digital imaging]], [[photographic printing]]. The similar artistic fields in the moving image camera domain are film, [[videography]], and [[cinematography]].\n\nThe word ''camera'' comes from ''[[camera obscura]]'', which means \"dark chamber\" and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external reality onto a flat surface. The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura. The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of the human eye.

This \"[[depth of field]]\" increases as the aperture closes, so that objects that are at differing distances from the camera can both be in focus; when the aperture is at its narrowest, the foreground and background are both in sharp focus.<ref name=\"Warren-35\" />\n\n==== Shutter ====\n{{Main|Shutter (photography)}}\n\nThe shutter, along with the aperture, is one of two ways to control the amount of light entering the camera. The shutter determines the duration that the light-sensitive surface is exposed to light. The shutter is opened, light enters the camera and exposes the film or sensor to light, and then the shutter closes.<ref name=\"Warren-camera\" /><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-240-80740-9|pages=770\u2013771|last=Rose|first=B|title=The Camera Defined|encyclopedia=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography|accessdate=12 December 2019|date=2007|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780240807409501525}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of mechanical shutters. The leaf-type uses a circular iris diaphragm maintained under spring tension inside or just behind the lens that rapidly opens and closes when the shutter is released.<ref name=\"Britannica-technology\" />\n[[File:Focal-plane shutter.jpg|thumb|A focal-plane shutter. In this shutter, the metal shutter blades travel vertically.]]\nMore commonly, a [[focal-plane shutter]] is used.<ref name=\"Warren-camera\" /> This shutter operates close to the film plane and employs metal plates or cloth curtains with an opening that passes across the light-sensitive surface. The curtains or plates have an opening that is pulled across the film plane during an exposure. The focal-plane shutter is typically used in [[Single-lens reflex camera|single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras]], since covering the film rather than blocking the light passing through the lens allows the photographer to view through the image through the lens at all times ''except'' during the exposure itself. Covering the film also facilitates removing the lens from a loaded camera (many SLRs have interchangeable lenses).<ref name=\"Columbia\" /><ref name=\"Britannica-technology\" />\n\n[[Digital camera]]s may use one of these types of mechanical shutters or they may use an electronic shutter, the type used in the cameras of smartphones. Electronic shutters either record data from the entire sensor at the same time (a global shutter) or record the data line by line across the sensor (a rolling shutter).<ref name=\"Columbia\" />\n\nIn movie cameras, a rotary shutter opens and closes in sync with the advancing of each frame of film.<ref name=\"Columbia\" /><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Motion-picture camera|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=12 December 2019|url=https://www-britannica-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/technology/motion-picture-camera}}</ref>\n\nThe duration is called the shutter speed or exposure time. The longer the shutter speed, the slower it is. Typical exposure times can range from one second to 1/1,000 of a second, though durations longer and shorter than this are not uncommon. In the early stages of photography, exposures were often several minutes long. These long exposure times often result in blurry images, as a single object is recorded in multiple places across a single image for the duration of the exposure. To prevent this, shorter exposure times can be used. Very short exposure times can capture fast-moving action and completely eliminate motion blur.<ref name=\"Philip's\">{{Cite encyclopedia|publisher=Philip's|isbn=978-0-19-954609-1|title=Camera|encyclopedia=World Encyclopedia|accessdate=12 December 2019|url=https://archive.org/details/worldencyclopedi00oxfo|url-access=registration|year=2004}}</ref><ref name=\"Britannica-technology\" /><ref name=\"Columbia\" /><ref name=\"Warren-camera\" />\n\nLike aperture settings, exposure times increment in powers of two. The two settings determine the exposure value (EV), a measure of how much light is recorded during the exposure. There is a direct relationship between the exposure times and aperture settings so that if the exposure time is lengthened one step, but the aperture opening is also narrowed one step, the amount of light exposing the film or sensor is the same.<ref name=\"Warren-camera\" />\n\n==== Metering ====\n{{Main|Light meter}}\n[[File:Sekonic L-358 Flash Master.jpg|thumb|A handheld digital light meter showing an exposure of 1/200th at an aperture of f/11, at ISO 100. The light sensor is on top, under the white diffusing hemisphere.]]\nIn most modern cameras, the amount of light entering the camera is measured using a built-in light meter or exposure meter.{{Efn|Some photographers use handheld exposure meters independent of the camera and use the readings to manually set the exposure settings on the camera.<ref name=\"Britannica-camera\" />|name=|}} Taken through the lens (and so called {{Abbr|TTL|through the lens}} metering), these readings are taken using a panel of [[Semiconductor|semi-conductors]] that are sensitive to light.<ref name=\"How\" /> They are used to help calculate the best exposure settings. These settings are typically determined automatically as the reading is used by the camera's [[microprocessor]]. The reading from the light meter is combined with aperture settings, exposure times, and film or sensor sensitivity to calculate the optimal exposure.{{Efn|Film canisters typically contain a DX code that can be read by modern cameras so that the camera's computer knows the sensitivity of the film, the ISO.<ref name=\"Warren-camera\" />]|name=|}}\n\nLight meters typically average the light in a scene to 18% middle gray. More advanced cameras are more nuanced in their metering, weighing the center of the frame more heavily (center-weighted metering), considering the differences in light across the image (matrix metering), or allowing the photographer to take a light reading at a specific point within the image (spot metering).<ref name=\"Warren-35\" /><ref name=\"Philip's\" /><ref name=\"Britannica-camera\" /><ref name=\"Columbia\" />\n\n=== Lens ===\n{{Main|Camera lens|Photographic lens design}}\n\nThe lens of a camera captures the light from the subject and brings it to a focus on the sensor. The design and manufacture of the lens is critical to the quality of the photograph being taken. The technological revolution in camera design in the 19th century revolutionized optical glass manufacture and lens design with great benefits for modern lens manufacture in a wide range of optical instruments from reading glasses to microscopes. Pioneers included [[Carl Zeiss|Zeiss]] and Leitz.\n\nCamera lenses are made in a wide range of focal lengths. They range from extreme [[wide-angle lens|wide angle]], and standard, medium [[telephoto lens|telephoto]]. Each lens is best suited to a certain type of photography. The extreme wide angle may be preferred for architecture because it has the capacity to capture a wide view of a building. The normal lens, because it often has a wide aperture, is often used for street and documentary photography. The telephoto lens is useful for sports and wildlife but it is more susceptible to camera shake.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-lenses.htm |title=Understanding Camera Lenses |last=McHugh |first=Sean |work=Cambridge in Colour |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819025344/http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-lenses.htm |archivedate=19 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Focus ====\n[[File:Daisies-Focus.jpg|thumb|right|The distance range in which objects appear clear and sharp, called [[depth of field]], can be adjusted by many cameras. This allows for a photographer to control which objects appear in focus, and which do not.|alt=An image of flowers, with one in focus. The background is out of focus.]]\n\nDue to the optical properties of [[photographic lens]]es, only objects within a limited range of distances from the camera will be reproduced clearly. The process of adjusting this range is known as changing the camera's focus. There are various ways of focusing a camera accurately. The simplest cameras have [[Focus free lens|fixed focus]] and use a small aperture and wide-angle lens to ensure that everything within a certain range of distance from the lens, usually around 3 metres (10&nbsp;ft) to infinity, is in reasonable focus. Fixed focus cameras are usually inexpensive types, such as single-use cameras. The camera can also have a limited focusing range or [[scale-focus]] that is indicated on the camera body. The user will guess or calculate the distance to the subject and adjust the focus accordingly. On some cameras this is indicated by symbols (head-and-shoulders; two people standing upright; one tree; mountains).\n\n[[Rangefinder camera]]s allow the distance to objects to be measured by means of a coupled parallax unit on top of the camera, allowing the focus to be set with accuracy. Single-lens reflex cameras allow the photographer to determine the focus and composition visually using the objective lens and a moving mirror to project the image onto a [[ground glass]] or plastic micro-prism screen. [[Twin-lens reflex camera]]s use an objective lens and a focusing lens unit (usually identical to the objective lens.) in a parallel body for composition and focusing. [[View camera]]s use a ground glass screen which is removed and replaced by either a photographic plate or a reusable holder containing [[sheet film]] before exposure. Modern cameras often offer [[autofocus]] systems to focus the camera automatically by a variety of methods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/autofocus.htm |title=How Autofocus Cameras Work |last=Brown |first=Gary |date=April 2000 |work=HowStuffWorks.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930141617/http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/autofocus.htm |archivedate=30 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome experimental cameras, for example the [[planar Fourier capture array]] (PFCA), do not require focusing to allow them to take pictures. In conventional digital photography, lenses or mirrors map all of the light originating from a single point of an in-focus object to a single point at the sensor plane. Each pixel thus relates an independent piece of information about the far-away scene. In contrast, a PFCA does not have a lens or mirror, but each pixel has an idiosyncratic pair of diffraction gratings above it, allowing each pixel to likewise relate an independent piece of information (specifically, one component of the [[Fourier transform#Two-dimensional functions|2D Fourier transform]]) about the far-away scene. Together, complete scene information is captured and images can be reconstructed by computation.\n\nSome cameras have post focusing. Post focusing means take the pictures first and then focusing later at the personal computer. The camera uses many tiny lenses on the sensor to capture light from every [[camera angle]] of a scene and is called plenoptics technology. A current [[plenoptic camera]] design has 40,000 lenses working together to grab the optimal picture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/technology-blog/lytro-camera-lets-focus-shooting-now-available-pre-003019940.html |title=Lytro camera lets you focus after shooting, now available for pre-order |last=Wehner |first=Mike |date=19 October 2011 |work=Yahoo!

Video and digital cameras use an electronic image sensor, usually a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) or a [[CMOS]] sensor to capture images which can be transferred or stored in a [[memory card]] or other storage inside the camera for later playback or [[digital image processing|processing]].\n\nA wide range of film and plate formats have been used by cameras. In the early history plate sizes were often specific for the make and model of camera although there quickly developed some standardisation for the more popular cameras. The introduction of [[roll film]] drove the standardization process still further so that by the 1950s only a few standard roll films were in use. These included [[120 film]] providing 8, 12 or 16 exposures, 220 film providing 16 or 24 exposures, 127 film providing 8 or 12 exposures (principally in [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie cameras]]) and 135 ([[35mm format|35mm film]]) providing 12, 20 or 36 exposures \u2013 or up to 72 exposures in the [[Half-frame camera|half-frame format]] or in bulk cassettes for the Leica Camera range.\n\nFor cine cameras, film 35&nbsp;mm wide and perforated with [[film perforations|sprocket holes]] was established as the standard format in the 1890s. It was used for nearly all film-based professional motion picture production. For amateur use, several smaller and therefore less expensive formats were introduced. 17.5&nbsp;mm film, created by splitting 35&nbsp;mm film, was one early amateur format, but [[9.5&nbsp;mm film]], introduced in Europe in 1922, and [[16&nbsp;mm film]], introduced in the US in 1923, soon became the standards for \"home movies\" in their respective hemispheres. In 1932, the even more economical [[8&nbsp;mm film|8&nbsp;mm]] format was created by doubling the number of perforations in 16&nbsp;mm film, then splitting it, usually after exposure and processing. The [[Super 8&nbsp;mm film|Super 8]] format, still 8&nbsp;mm wide but with smaller perforations to make room for substantially larger [[film frame]]s, was introduced in 1965.\n\n==== Film speed ====\nTraditionally used to \"tell the camera\" the [[film speed]] of the selected film on film cameras, film speed numbers are employed on modern digital cameras as an indication of the system's ''[[Gain (electronics)|gain]]'' from light to numerical output and to control the automatic exposure system. Film speed is usually measured via the [[ISO 5800|ISO]] system. The higher the film speed number the greater the film sensitivity to light, whereas with a lower number, the film is less sensitive to light.\n\n==== White balance ====\nOn digital cameras, electronic compensation for the [[color temperature]] associated with a given set of lighting conditions, ensuring that white light is registered as such on the imaging chip and therefore that the colors in the frame will appear natural. On mechanical, film-based cameras, this function is served by the operator's choice of [[film stock]] or with color correction filters. In addition to using white balance to register natural coloration of the image, photographers may employ white balance to aesthetic end, for example, white balancing to a blue object in order to obtain a warm color temperature.\n\n=== Camera accessories ===\n==== Flash ====\nA flash, which provides a short burst of bright light during the exposure, is a commonly used artificial light source in photography. Most modern flash systems use a battery-powered high-voltage discharge through a gas-filled tube to generate bright light for a very short time (1/1,000 of a second or less).{{Efn|The older type of disposable flashbulb uses an aluminum or zirconium wire in a glass tube filled with oxygen. During the exposure, the wire is burned away, producing a bright flash.<ref name=\"Britannica-camera\" /> |name=|}}<ref name=\"Britannica-camera\" />\n\nMany flash units measure the light reflected from the flash to help determine the appropriate duration of the flash. When the flash is attached directly to the camera\u2014typically in a slot at the top of the camera (the flash shoe or hot shoe) or through a cable\u2014activating the shutter on the camera triggers the flash, and the camera's internal light meter can help determine the duration of the flash.<ref name=\"Britannica-camera\" /><ref name=\"Warren-35\" />\n\n==== Other accessories ====\n{{Prose|section|date=December 2019}}Accessories for cameras are mainly for care, protection, special effects and functions.\n* [[Lens hood]]: used on the end of a lens to block the sun or other light source to prevent glare and lens flare (see also [[matte box]]).\n* [[Lens cap]]: covers and protects the lens during storage.\n* [[Lens adapter]]: allows the use of lenses other than those for which the camera was designed.\n* [[Photographic filter|Lens filters]]: allow artificial colors or change light density.\n* [[Extension tube|Lens extension tubes]] allow close focus in [[macro photography]].\n* [[Flash (photography)|Flash equipment]]: including [[Diffuser (optics)|light diffuser]], mount and stand, reflector, [[soft box]], trigger and cord.\n* Care and protection: including camera case and cover, maintenance tools, and screen protector.\n* [[Camera monitor]]: provides an off-camera view of the composition with a brighter and more colorful screen, and typically exposes more advanced tools such as framing guides, [[focus peaking]], [[zebra patterning|zebra stripes]], [[waveform monitor]]s (oftentimes as an \"RGB parade\"), [[vectorscope]]s and [[false color]] to highlight areas of the image critical to the photographer.\n* [[Large format (photography)|Large format cameras]] use special equipment which includes magnifier loupe, view finder, angle finder, focusing rail /truck.\n* Battery and sometimes a charger.\n* Some professional SLR could be provided with interchangeable [[Viewfinder|finders]] for eye-level or waist-level focusing, [[focusing screen]]s, eye-cup, data backs, [[Motor drive|motor-drives]] for film transportation or external battery packs.\n* Tripod, primarily used for keeping the camera steady while recording video, doing long exposure and [[Time-lapse photography|timelapse]] photography.\n* microscope adapter, an adapter used to connect a camera to a microscope to photograph what the microscope is examining.\n* [[Bulb (photography)|cable release]], a remote shutter button that can be connected to the camera via a cable to remotely control the shutter, it can be used to lock the shutter open for a desired period of time.

When the shutter is released, the mirror swings up and away allowing the exposure of the [[Photography|photographic medium]] and instantly returns after the exposure. No SLR camera before 1954 had this feature, although the mirror on some early SLR cameras was entirely operated by the force exerted on the shutter release and only returned when the finger pressure was released.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the 35&nbsp;mm Still Camera |author=Roger Hicks |publisher=Focal Press, London & Boston |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-240-51233-4 |page=137}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Register of 35&nbsp;mm SLR cameras |author=Rudolph Lea |publisher=Wittig Books, H\u00fcckelhoven |year=1993 |isbn=978-3-88984-130-8 |page=23}}</ref> The [[Asahiflex IIB|Asahiflex II]], released by Japanese company [[Pentax|Asahi (Pentax)]] in 1954, was the world's first SLR camera with an instant return mirror.<ref>Michael R. Peres (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMJxyAwGvKcC&pg=PA779 ''The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography'', p. 779], [[Taylor & Francis]]</ref>\n\nIn the single-lens reflex camera, the photographer sees the scene through the camera lens. This avoids the problem of [[parallax]] which occurs when the viewfinder or viewing lens is separated from the taking lens. Single-lens reflex cameras have been made in several formats including sheet film 5x7\" and 4x5\", roll film 220/120 taking 8,10, 12 or 16 photographs on a 120 roll and twice that number of a 220 film. These correspond to 6x9, 6x7, 6x6 and 6x4.5 respectively (all dimensions in cm). Notable manufacturers of large format and roll film SLR cameras include [[Bronica]], [[Graflex]], [[Hasselblad]], [[Mamiya]], and Pentax. However the most common format of SLR cameras has been 35&nbsp;mm and subsequently the migration to [[digital SLR]] cameras, using almost identical sized bodies and sometimes using the same lens systems.\n\nAlmost all SLR cameras use a front surfaced mirror in the optical path to direct the light from the lens via a viewing screen and [[pentaprism]] to the eyepiece. At the time of exposure the mirror is flipped up out of the light path before the shutter opens. Some early cameras experimented with other methods of providing through-the-lens viewing, including the use of a semi-transparent [[Pellicle mirror|pellicle]] as in the [[Canon (company)|Canon]] ''Pellix''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/canon/fdresources/pellix/ |title=Canon Pellix Camera |work=Photography in Malaysia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016173448/http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/canon/fdresources/pellix/ |archivedate=16 October 2013}}</ref> and others with a small periscope such as in the [[K. G. Corfield Ltd|Corfield]] Periflex series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/Museum/CorfieldCameras/page3.htm |title=Corfield Cameras \u2013 The Periflex Era |last=Parker |first=Bev |publisher=Wolverhampton Museum of Industry}}</ref>\n\n=== Large-format camera ===\n{{Main|View camera}}\n\nThe large-format camera, taking sheet film, is a direct successor of the early plate cameras and remained in use for high quality photography and for technical, architectural and industrial photography. There are three common types, the view camera with its [[Monorail camera|monorail]] and [[field camera]] variants, and the [[press camera]]. They have an extensible bellows with the lens and shutter mounted on a lens plate at the front. Backs taking [[rollfilm]], and later [[digital back]]s are available in addition to the standard dark slide back. These cameras have a wide range of movements allowing very close control of focus and perspective. Composition and focusing is done on view cameras by viewing a [[ground-glass]] screen which is replaced by the film to make the exposure; they are suitable for static subjects only, and are slow to use.\n\n==== Plate camera ====\n[[File:Studijskifotoaparat.JPG|thumb|19th century studio camera, with bellows for focusing]]\n{{Main|Photographic plate}}\nThe earliest cameras produced in significant numbers used sensitised glass plates were ''plate cameras''. Light entered a lens mounted on a lens board which was separated from the plate by an extendible bellows.There were simple box cameras for glass plates but also single-lens reflex cameras with interchangeable lenses and even for color photography ([[Autochrome Lumi\u00e8re]]). Many of these cameras had controls to raise or lower the lens and to tilt it forwards or backwards to control perspective.\n\nFocusing of these plate cameras was by the use of a ground glass screen at the point of focus. Because [[Photographic lens design|lens design]] only allowed rather small aperture lenses, the image on the ground glass screen was faint and most photographers had a dark cloth to cover their heads to allow focussing and composition to be carried out more easily. When focus and composition were satisfactory, the ground glass screen was removed and a sensitised plate put in its place protected by a [[dark slide (photography)|dark slide]]. To make the exposure, the dark slide was carefully slid out and the shutter opened and then closed and the dark slide replaced.\n\nGlass plates were later replaced by sheet film in a dark slide for sheet film; adaptor sleeves were made to allow sheet film to be used in plate holders. In addition to the ground glass, a simple optical viewfinder was often fitted.\n\n=== Medium-format camera ===\n{{Main|Medium-format}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}Medium-format cameras have a film size between the large-format cameras and smaller 35&nbsp;mm cameras. Typically these systems use 120 or 220 rollfilm. The most common image sizes are 6\u00d74.5&nbsp;cm, 6\u00d76&nbsp;cm and 6\u00d77&nbsp;cm; the older 6\u00d79&nbsp;cm is rarely used. The designs of this kind of camera show greater variation than their larger brethren, ranging from monorail systems through the classic Hasselblad model with separate backs, to smaller rangefinder cameras. There are even compact amateur cameras available in this format.\n\n==== Twin-lens reflex camera ====\n[[File:Rolleiflex camera.jpg|thumb|Twin-lens reflex camera]]\n{{Main|Twin-lens reflex camera}}\n\nTwin-lens reflex cameras used a pair of nearly identical lenses, one to form the image and one as a viewfinder. The lenses were arranged with the viewing lens immediately above the taking lens. The viewing lens projects an image onto a viewing screen which can be seen from above. Some manufacturers such as Mamiya also provided a reflex head to attach to the viewing screen to allow the camera to be held to the eye when in use. The advantage of a TLR was that it could be easily focussed using the viewing screen and that under most circumstances the view seen in the viewing screen was identical to that recorded on film. At close distances however, parallax errors were encountered and some cameras also included an indicator to show what part of the composition would be excluded.\n\nSome TLR had interchangeable lenses but as these had to be paired lenses they were relatively heavy and did not provide the range of focal lengths that the SLR could support. Most TLRs used 120 or 220 film; some used the smaller 127 film.\n\n=== Compact cameras ===\n==== Instant camera ====\n{{Main|Instant camera}}\n\nAfter exposure every photograph is taken through pinch rollers inside of the instant camera. Thereby the developer paste contained in the paper 'sandwich' distributes on the image. After a minute, the cover sheet just needs to be removed and one gets a single original positive image with a fixed format. With some systems it was also possible to create an instant image negative, from which then could be made copies in the photo lab. The ultimate development was the SX-70 system of [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], in which a row of ten shots \u2013 engine driven \u2013 could be made without having to remove any cover sheets from the picture. There were instant cameras for a variety of formats, as well as adapters for instant film use in medium- and large-format cameras.\n\n==== Subminiature camera ====\n{{Main|Subminiature camera}}[[File:2016 Minox C 8.jpg|thumb|Subminiature spy camera]]\n\nCameras taking film significantly smaller than 35&nbsp;mm were made. Subminiature cameras were first produced in the nineteenth century. The expensive 8\u00d711&nbsp;mm [[Minox]], the only type of camera produced by the company from 1937 to 1976, became very widely known and was often used for espionage (the Minox company later also produced larger cameras). Later inexpensive subminiatures were made for general use, some using rewound 16&nbsp;mm cine film. Image quality with these small film sizes was limited.\n\n==== Folding camera ====\n{{Main|Folding camera}}\n\nThe introduction of films enabled the existing designs for plate cameras to be made much smaller and for the base-plate to be hinged so that it could be folded up compressing the bellows. These designs were very compact and small models were dubbed ''vest pocket'' cameras. Folding rollfilm cameras were preceded by folding plate cameras, more compact than other designs.\n\n==== Box camera ====\n{{Main|Box camera}}\n\nBox cameras were introduced as a budget level camera and had few if any controls. The original box Brownie models had a small reflex viewfinder mounted on the top of the camera and had no aperture or focusing controls and just a simple shutter. Later models such as the Brownie 127 had larger direct view optical viewfinders together with a curved film path to reduce the impact of deficiencies in the lens.\n\n=== Rangefinder camera ===\n[[File:Leica IIIa Rangefinder.jpg|thumb|Rangefinder camera, Leica c. 1936]]\n{{Main|Rangefinder camera}}\n\nAs camera a lens technology developed and wide aperture lenses became more common, [[rangefinder]] cameras were introduced to make focusing more precise. Early rangefinders had two separate viewfinder windows, one of which is linked to the focusing mechanisms and moved right or left as the focusing ring is turned. The two separate images are brought together on a ground glass viewing screen. When vertical lines in the object being photographed meet exactly in the combined image, the object is in focus. A normal composition viewfinder is also provided. Later the viewfinder and rangefinder were combined. Many rangefinder cameras had [[interchangeable lens]]es, each lens requiring its own range- and viewfinder linkages.\n\nRangefinder cameras were produced in [[Half-frame|half-]] and full-frame 35&nbsp;mm and rollfilm (medium format).\n\n=== Motion picture cameras ===\n{{Main|Movie camera}}\n{{See|Digital movie camera}}\n\nA [[movie camera]] or a [[video camera]] operates similarly to a still camera, except it records a series of static images in rapid succession, commonly at a [[frame rate|rate]] of 24 frames per second. When the images are combined and displayed in order, the illusion of motion is achieved.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/filmmakershandbo00asch_0 |title=The Filmmaker's Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide for the Digital Age |last1=Ascher |first1=Steven |last2=Pincus |first2=Edward |publisher=Penguin Group |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-452-28678-8 |edition=3 |location=New York |url-access=registration}}</ref>{{Rp|4}}\n\nCameras that capture many images in sequence are known as movie cameras or as cin\u00e9 cameras in Europe; those designed for single images are still cameras. However these categories overlap as still cameras are often used to capture moving images in [[special effect]]s work and many modern cameras can quickly switch between still and motion recording modes.\n\nA cin\u00e9 camera or movie camera takes a rapid sequence of photographs on image sensor or strips of film. In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot at a time, the cin\u00e9 camera takes a series of images, each called a \"frame\" through the use of an intermittent mechanism.\n\nThe frames are later played back in a cin\u00e9 projector at a specific speed, called the \"frame rate\" (number of frames per second). While viewing, a person's eyes and brain [[persistence of vision|merge the separate pictures]] to create the illusion of motion. The first cin\u00e9 camera was built around 1888 and by 1890 several types were being manufactured. The standard film size for cin\u00e9 cameras was quickly established as [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] and this remained in use until transition to digital cinematography. Other professional standard formats include [[70&nbsp;mm film]] and 16&nbsp;mm film whilst amateurs film makers used 9.5&nbsp;mm film, 8&nbsp;mm film or Standard 8 and Super 8 before the move into digital format.\n\nThe size and complexity of cin\u00e9 cameras varies greatly depending on the uses required of the camera. Some professional equipment is very large and too heavy to be hand held whilst some amateur cameras were designed to be very small and light for single-handed operation.\n\n==== Professional video camera ====\n[[File:Arri Alexa camera.jpg|thumb|[[Arri Alexa]], a digital movie camera]]\n{{Main|Professional video camera}}\n{{See|Video camera}}\n\nA professional video camera (often called a television camera even though the use has spread beyond television) is a high-end device for creating electronic moving images (as opposed to a movie camera, that earlier recorded the images on [[filmstock|film]]). Originally developed for use in television studios, they are now also used for music videos, [[direct-to-video]] movies, corporate and educational videos, marriage videos etc.\n\nThese cameras earlier used [[Video camera tube|vacuum tubes]] and later electronic [[image sensors]].\n\n==== Camcorders ====\n{{Main|Camcorders}}\n\nA camcorder is an electronic device combining a video camera and a video recorder. Although marketing materials may use the colloquial term \"camcorder\", the name on the package and manual is often \"video camera recorder\". Most devices capable of recording video are camera phones and digital cameras primarily intended for still pictures; the term \"camcorder\" is used to describe a portable, self-contained device, with video capture and recording its primary function.\n\n=== Digital camera ===\n{{Main|Digital camera}}\n{{see|Digital image|Digital imaging|Digital photography|Digital single-lens reflex camera|Digital video}}\n\nA digital camera (or digicam) is a camera that encodes [[digital image]]s and videos digitally and stores them for later reproduction.<ref>Farlex Inc: [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/digital+camera definition of digital camera at the Free Dictionary]; retrieved 7 September 2013</ref> They typically use semiconductor image sensors.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=J.

However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from [[Flash memory|memory]]. Most digital cameras can also record moving videos with [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound]]. Some digital cameras can [[Cropping (image)|crop]] and [[Image stitching|stitch]] pictures and perform other elementary [[image editing]].\n\nConsumers adopted digital cameras in 1990s. Professional video cameras transitioned to digital around the 2000s\u20132010s. Finally movie cameras transitioned to digital in the 2010s.\n\nThe first camera using digital electronics to capture and store images was developed by Kodak engineer [[Steven Sasson]] in 1975. He used a charge-coupled device (CCD) provided by [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], which provided only 0.01 megapixels to capture images. Sasson combined the CCD device with movie camera parts to create a digital camera that saved black and white images onto a [[Compact cassette|cassette tape]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gustavson |first1=Todd |title=500 Cameras: 170 Years of Photographic Innovation |publisher=Sterling Publishing, Inc |date=1 November 2011 |location=Toronto, Ontario |isbn=978-1-4027-8086-8}}</ref>{{Rp|442}}The images were then read from the cassette and viewed on a TV monitor.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hitchcock, Susan (editor) |title=National Geographic complete photography |editor=Susan Tyler Hitchcock |publisher=National Geographic Society |date=20 September 2011 |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-1-4351-3968-8}}</ref>{{Rp|225}} Later, cassette tapes were replaced by flash memory.\n\nIn 1986, Japanese company [[Nikon]] introduced an analog-recording electronic single-lens reflex camera, the Nikon SVC.<ref>[http://apphotnum.free.fr/N2BE2.html Nikon SLR-type digital cameras], Pierre Jarleton</ref>\n\nThe first [[full-frame digital SLR]] cameras were developed in Japan from around 2000 to 2002: the MZ-D by Pentax,<ref>[https://www.dpreview.com/opinion/4721880615/the-long-difficult-road-to-pentax-full-frame The long, difficult road to Pentax full-frame The long, difficult road to Pentax full-frame], [[Digital Photography Review]]</ref> the [[Contax N Digital|N Digital]] by [[Contax]]'s Japanese R6D team,<ref>''[[British Journal of Photography]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=uk9WAAAAMAAJ Issues 7410-7422], 2003, p. 2</ref> and the [[Canon EOS-1Ds|EOS-1Ds]] by [[Canon Inc.|Canon]].<ref>[https://www.dpreview.com/articles/7466980622/canoneos1ds Canon EOS-1Ds, 11 megapixel full-frame CMOS], [[Digital Photography Review]]</ref> Gradually in the 2000s, the full-frame DSLR became the dominant camera type for professional photography.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nOn most digital cameras a display, often a [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD), permits the user to view the scene to be recorded and settings such as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] speed, exposure, and shutter speed.<ref name=\"London\" />{{Rp|6\u20137}}<ref>{{cite book |title=National Geographic photography field guide |last1=Burian |first1=Peter |last2=Caputo |first2=Robert |publisher=National Geographic Society |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7922-5676-2 |edition=2 |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>{{Rp|12}}\n\n==== Camera phone ====\n[[File:Phone photography.jpg|thumb|Smartphone with built-in camera spreads private images globally, c. 2013]]\n{{Main|Camera phone}}\n{{See|Front-facing camera|Selfie}}\n\nIn 2000, [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the world's first digital camera phone, the [[J-SH04]] [[J-Phone]], in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hoista.net/post/18437919296/evolution-of-the-cameraphone-from-sharp-j-sh04-to |title=Evolution of the Camera phone: From Sharp J-SH04 to Nokia 808 Pureview |date=28 February 2012 |publisher=Hoista.net |accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> By the mid-2000s, higher-end [[cell phones]] had an integrated digital camera.

At their most basic, cameras are sealed boxes (the camera body) with a small hole (the [[aperture]]) that let light in to capture an image on a light-sensitive surface (usually [[photographic film]] or a [[digital sensor]]). Cameras have various mechanisms to control how the light falls onto the light-sensitive surface. [[Lens]]es focus the light entering the camera, the size of the aperture can be widened or narrowed to let more or less light into the camera, and a [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] mechanism determines the amount of time the photo-sensitive surface is exposed to the light.\n\nThe still image camera is the main instrument in the art of photography and captured images may be reproduced later as a part of the process of photography, [[digital imaging]], [[photographic printing]]. The similar artistic fields in the moving image camera domain are film, [[videography]], and [[cinematography]].\n\nThe word ''camera'' comes from ''[[camera obscura]]'', which means \"dark chamber\" and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external reality onto a flat surface. The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura. The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of the human eye. The first permanent photograph was made in 1825 by [[Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce|Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]].\n\n== Mechanics ==\n[[File:Reflex camera simple labels.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Basic elements of a modern digital [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] still camera]]\nA camera captures light [[photon]]s, usually from the [[visible spectrum]] for human viewing, but in general could also be from other portions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gustavson |first1=Todd |title=Camera: a history of photography from daguerreotype to digital |publisher=Sterling Publishing Co., Inc |year=2009 |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4027-5656-6}}</ref>{{Rp|vii}}\n\nAll cameras use the same basic design: light enters an enclosed box through a converging or convex [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and an image is recorded on a light-sensitive medium (mainly a [[transition metal]]-[[Halogen|halide]]).

This \"[[depth of field]]\" increases as the aperture closes, so that objects that are at differing distances from the camera can both be in focus; when the aperture is at its narrowest, the foreground and background are both in sharp focus.<ref name=\"Warren-35\" />\n\n==== Shutter ====\n{{Main|Shutter (photography)}}\n\nThe shutter, along with the aperture, is one of two ways to control the amount of light entering the camera. The shutter determines the duration that the light-sensitive surface is exposed to light. The shutter is opened, light enters the camera and exposes the film or sensor to light, and then the shutter closes.<ref name=\"Warren-camera\" /><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-240-80740-9|pages=770\u2013771|last=Rose|first=B|title=The Camera Defined|encyclopedia=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography|accessdate=12 December 2019|date=2007|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780240807409501525}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of mechanical shutters. The leaf-type uses a circular iris diaphragm maintained under spring tension inside or just behind the lens that rapidly opens and closes when the shutter is released.<ref name=\"Britannica-technology\" />\n[[File:Focal-plane shutter.jpg|thumb|A focal-plane shutter. In this shutter, the metal shutter blades travel vertically.]]\nMore commonly, a [[focal-plane shutter]] is used.<ref name=\"Warren-camera\" /> This shutter operates close to the film plane and employs metal plates or cloth curtains with an opening that passes across the light-sensitive surface. The curtains or plates have an opening that is pulled across the film plane during an exposure. The focal-plane shutter is typically used in [[Single-lens reflex camera|single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras]], since covering the film rather than blocking the light passing through the lens allows the photographer to view through the image through the lens at all times ''except'' during the exposure itself. Covering the film also facilitates removing the lens from a loaded camera (many SLRs have interchangeable lenses).<ref name=\"Columbia\" /><ref name=\"Britannica-technology\" />\n\n[[Digital camera]]s may use one of these types of mechanical shutters or they may use an electronic shutter, the type used in the cameras of smartphones. Electronic shutters either record data from the entire sensor at the same time (a global shutter) or record the data line by line across the sensor (a rolling shutter).<ref name=\"Columbia\" />\n\nIn movie cameras, a rotary shutter opens and closes in sync with the advancing of each frame of film.<ref name=\"Columbia\" /><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Motion-picture camera|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=12 December 2019|url=https://www-britannica-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/technology/motion-picture-camera}}</ref>\n\nThe duration is called the shutter speed or exposure time. The longer the shutter speed, the slower it is. Typical exposure times can range from one second to 1/1,000 of a second, though durations longer and shorter than this are not uncommon. In the early stages of photography, exposures were often several minutes long. These long exposure times often result in blurry images, as a single object is recorded in multiple places across a single image for the duration of the exposure. To prevent this, shorter exposure times can be used. Very short exposure times can capture fast-moving action and completely eliminate motion blur.<ref name=\"Philip's\">{{Cite encyclopedia|publisher=Philip's|isbn=978-0-19-954609-1|title=Camera|encyclopedia=World Encyclopedia|accessdate=12 December 2019|url=https://archive.org/details/worldencyclopedi00oxfo|url-access=registration|year=2004}}</ref><ref name=\"Britannica-technology\" /><ref name=\"Columbia\" /><ref name=\"Warren-camera\" />\n\nLike aperture settings, exposure times increment in powers of two. The two settings determine the exposure value (EV), a measure of how much light is recorded during the exposure. There is a direct relationship between the exposure times and aperture settings so that if the exposure time is lengthened one step, but the aperture opening is also narrowed one step, the amount of light exposing the film or sensor is the same.<ref name=\"Warren-camera\" />\n\n==== Metering ====\n{{Main|Light meter}}\n[[File:Sekonic L-358 Flash Master.jpg|thumb|A handheld digital light meter showing an exposure of 1/200th at an aperture of f/11, at ISO 100. The light sensor is on top, under the white diffusing hemisphere.]]\nIn most modern cameras, the amount of light entering the camera is measured using a built-in light meter or exposure meter.{{Efn|Some photographers use handheld exposure meters independent of the camera and use the readings to manually set the exposure settings on the camera.<ref name=\"Britannica-camera\" />|name=|}} Taken through the lens (and so called {{Abbr|TTL|through the lens}} metering), these readings are taken using a panel of [[Semiconductor|semi-conductors]] that are sensitive to light.<ref name=\"How\" /> They are used to help calculate the best exposure settings. These settings are typically determined automatically as the reading is used by the camera's [[microprocessor]]. The reading from the light meter is combined with aperture settings, exposure times, and film or sensor sensitivity to calculate the optimal exposure.{{Efn|Film canisters typically contain a DX code that can be read by modern cameras so that the camera's computer knows the sensitivity of the film, the ISO.<ref name=\"Warren-camera\" />]|name=|}}\n\nLight meters typically average the light in a scene to 18% middle gray. More advanced cameras are more nuanced in their metering, weighing the center of the frame more heavily (center-weighted metering), considering the differences in light across the image (matrix metering), or allowing the photographer to take a light reading at a specific point within the image (spot metering).<ref name=\"Warren-35\" /><ref name=\"Philip's\" /><ref name=\"Britannica-camera\" /><ref name=\"Columbia\" />\n\n=== Lens ===\n{{Main|Camera lens|Photographic lens design}}\n\nThe lens of a camera captures the light from the subject and brings it to a focus on the sensor. The design and manufacture of the lens is critical to the quality of the photograph being taken. The technological revolution in camera design in the 19th century revolutionized optical glass manufacture and lens design with great benefits for modern lens manufacture in a wide range of optical instruments from reading glasses to microscopes. Pioneers included [[Carl Zeiss|Zeiss]] and Leitz.\n\nCamera lenses are made in a wide range of focal lengths. They range from extreme [[wide-angle lens|wide angle]], and standard, medium [[telephoto lens|telephoto]]. Each lens is best suited to a certain type of photography. The extreme wide angle may be preferred for architecture because it has the capacity to capture a wide view of a building. The normal lens, because it often has a wide aperture, is often used for street and documentary photography. The telephoto lens is useful for sports and wildlife but it is more susceptible to camera shake.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-lenses.htm |title=Understanding Camera Lenses |last=McHugh |first=Sean |work=Cambridge in Colour |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819025344/http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-lenses.htm |archivedate=19 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Focus ====\n[[File:Daisies-Focus.jpg|thumb|right|The distance range in which objects appear clear and sharp, called [[depth of field]], can be adjusted by many cameras. This allows for a photographer to control which objects appear in focus, and which do not.|alt=An image of flowers, with one in focus. The background is out of focus.]]\n\nDue to the optical properties of [[photographic lens]]es, only objects within a limited range of distances from the camera will be reproduced clearly. The process of adjusting this range is known as changing the camera's focus. There are various ways of focusing a camera accurately. The simplest cameras have [[Focus free lens|fixed focus]] and use a small aperture and wide-angle lens to ensure that everything within a certain range of distance from the lens, usually around 3 metres (10&nbsp;ft) to infinity, is in reasonable focus. Fixed focus cameras are usually inexpensive types, such as single-use cameras. The camera can also have a limited focusing range or [[scale-focus]] that is indicated on the camera body. The user will guess or calculate the distance to the subject and adjust the focus accordingly. On some cameras this is indicated by symbols (head-and-shoulders; two people standing upright; one tree; mountains).\n\n[[Rangefinder camera]]s allow the distance to objects to be measured by means of a coupled parallax unit on top of the camera, allowing the focus to be set with accuracy. Single-lens reflex cameras allow the photographer to determine the focus and composition visually using the objective lens and a moving mirror to project the image onto a [[ground glass]] or plastic micro-prism screen. [[Twin-lens reflex camera]]s use an objective lens and a focusing lens unit (usually identical to the objective lens.) in a parallel body for composition and focusing. [[View camera]]s use a ground glass screen which is removed and replaced by either a photographic plate or a reusable holder containing [[sheet film]] before exposure. Modern cameras often offer [[autofocus]] systems to focus the camera automatically by a variety of methods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/autofocus.htm |title=How Autofocus Cameras Work |last=Brown |first=Gary |date=April 2000 |work=HowStuffWorks.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930141617/http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/autofocus.htm |archivedate=30 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome experimental cameras, for example the [[planar Fourier capture array]] (PFCA), do not require focusing to allow them to take pictures. In conventional digital photography, lenses or mirrors map all of the light originating from a single point of an in-focus object to a single point at the sensor plane. Each pixel thus relates an independent piece of information about the far-away scene. In contrast, a PFCA does not have a lens or mirror, but each pixel has an idiosyncratic pair of diffraction gratings above it, allowing each pixel to likewise relate an independent piece of information (specifically, one component of the [[Fourier transform#Two-dimensional functions|2D Fourier transform]]) about the far-away scene. Together, complete scene information is captured and images can be reconstructed by computation.\n\nSome cameras have post focusing. Post focusing means take the pictures first and then focusing later at the personal computer. The camera uses many tiny lenses on the sensor to capture light from every [[camera angle]] of a scene and is called plenoptics technology. A current [[plenoptic camera]] design has 40,000 lenses working together to grab the optimal picture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/technology-blog/lytro-camera-lets-focus-shooting-now-available-pre-003019940.html |title=Lytro camera lets you focus after shooting, now available for pre-order |last=Wehner |first=Mike |date=19 October 2011 |work=Yahoo!

Video and digital cameras use an electronic image sensor, usually a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) or a [[CMOS]] sensor to capture images which can be transferred or stored in a [[memory card]] or other storage inside the camera for later playback or [[digital image processing|processing]].\n\nA wide range of film and plate formats have been used by cameras. In the early history plate sizes were often specific for the make and model of camera although there quickly developed some standardisation for the more popular cameras. The introduction of [[roll film]] drove the standardization process still further so that by the 1950s only a few standard roll films were in use. These included [[120 film]] providing 8, 12 or 16 exposures, 220 film providing 16 or 24 exposures, 127 film providing 8 or 12 exposures (principally in [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie cameras]]) and 135 ([[35mm format|35mm film]]) providing 12, 20 or 36 exposures \u2013 or up to 72 exposures in the [[Half-frame camera|half-frame format]] or in bulk cassettes for the Leica Camera range.\n\nFor cine cameras, film 35&nbsp;mm wide and perforated with [[film perforations|sprocket holes]] was established as the standard format in the 1890s. It was used for nearly all film-based professional motion picture production. For amateur use, several smaller and therefore less expensive formats were introduced. 17.5&nbsp;mm film, created by splitting 35&nbsp;mm film, was one early amateur format, but [[9.5&nbsp;mm film]], introduced in Europe in 1922, and [[16&nbsp;mm film]], introduced in the US in 1923, soon became the standards for \"home movies\" in their respective hemispheres. In 1932, the even more economical [[8&nbsp;mm film|8&nbsp;mm]] format was created by doubling the number of perforations in 16&nbsp;mm film, then splitting it, usually after exposure and processing. The [[Super 8&nbsp;mm film|Super 8]] format, still 8&nbsp;mm wide but with smaller perforations to make room for substantially larger [[film frame]]s, was introduced in 1965.\n\n==== Film speed ====\nTraditionally used to \"tell the camera\" the [[film speed]] of the selected film on film cameras, film speed numbers are employed on modern digital cameras as an indication of the system's ''[[Gain (electronics)|gain]]'' from light to numerical output and to control the automatic exposure system. Film speed is usually measured via the [[ISO 5800|ISO]] system. The higher the film speed number the greater the film sensitivity to light, whereas with a lower number, the film is less sensitive to light.\n\n==== White balance ====\nOn digital cameras, electronic compensation for the [[color temperature]] associated with a given set of lighting conditions, ensuring that white light is registered as such on the imaging chip and therefore that the colors in the frame will appear natural. On mechanical, film-based cameras, this function is served by the operator's choice of [[film stock]] or with color correction filters. In addition to using white balance to register natural coloration of the image, photographers may employ white balance to aesthetic end, for example, white balancing to a blue object in order to obtain a warm color temperature.\n\n=== Camera accessories ===\n==== Flash ====\nA flash, which provides a short burst of bright light during the exposure, is a commonly used artificial light source in photography. Most modern flash systems use a battery-powered high-voltage discharge through a gas-filled tube to generate bright light for a very short time (1/1,000 of a second or less).{{Efn|The older type of disposable flashbulb uses an aluminum or zirconium wire in a glass tube filled with oxygen. During the exposure, the wire is burned away, producing a bright flash.<ref name=\"Britannica-camera\" /> |name=|}}<ref name=\"Britannica-camera\" />\n\nMany flash units measure the light reflected from the flash to help determine the appropriate duration of the flash. When the flash is attached directly to the camera\u2014typically in a slot at the top of the camera (the flash shoe or hot shoe) or through a cable\u2014activating the shutter on the camera triggers the flash, and the camera's internal light meter can help determine the duration of the flash.<ref name=\"Britannica-camera\" /><ref name=\"Warren-35\" />\n\n==== Other accessories ====\n{{Prose|section|date=December 2019}}Accessories for cameras are mainly for care, protection, special effects and functions.\n* [[Lens hood]]: used on the end of a lens to block the sun or other light source to prevent glare and lens flare (see also [[matte box]]).\n* [[Lens cap]]: covers and protects the lens during storage.\n* [[Lens adapter]]: allows the use of lenses other than those for which the camera was designed.\n* [[Photographic filter|Lens filters]]: allow artificial colors or change light density.\n* [[Extension tube|Lens extension tubes]] allow close focus in [[macro photography]].\n* [[Flash (photography)|Flash equipment]]: including [[Diffuser (optics)|light diffuser]], mount and stand, reflector, [[soft box]], trigger and cord.\n* Care and protection: including camera case and cover, maintenance tools, and screen protector.\n* [[Camera monitor]]: provides an off-camera view of the composition with a brighter and more colorful screen, and typically exposes more advanced tools such as framing guides, [[focus peaking]], [[zebra patterning|zebra stripes]], [[waveform monitor]]s (oftentimes as an \"RGB parade\"), [[vectorscope]]s and [[false color]] to highlight areas of the image critical to the photographer.\n* [[Large format (photography)|Large format cameras]] use special equipment which includes magnifier loupe, view finder, angle finder, focusing rail /truck.\n* Battery and sometimes a charger.\n* Some professional SLR could be provided with interchangeable [[Viewfinder|finders]] for eye-level or waist-level focusing, [[focusing screen]]s, eye-cup, data backs, [[Motor drive|motor-drives]] for film transportation or external battery packs.\n* Tripod, primarily used for keeping the camera steady while recording video, doing long exposure and [[Time-lapse photography|timelapse]] photography.\n* microscope adapter, an adapter used to connect a camera to a microscope to photograph what the microscope is examining.\n* [[Bulb (photography)|cable release]], a remote shutter button that can be connected to the camera via a cable to remotely control the shutter, it can be used to lock the shutter open for a desired period of time.

When the shutter is released, the mirror swings up and away allowing the exposure of the [[Photography|photographic medium]] and instantly returns after the exposure. No SLR camera before 1954 had this feature, although the mirror on some early SLR cameras was entirely operated by the force exerted on the shutter release and only returned when the finger pressure was released.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the 35&nbsp;mm Still Camera |author=Roger Hicks |publisher=Focal Press, London & Boston |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-240-51233-4 |page=137}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Register of 35&nbsp;mm SLR cameras |author=Rudolph Lea |publisher=Wittig Books, H\u00fcckelhoven |year=1993 |isbn=978-3-88984-130-8 |page=23}}</ref> The [[Asahiflex IIB|Asahiflex II]], released by Japanese company [[Pentax|Asahi (Pentax)]] in 1954, was the world's first SLR camera with an instant return mirror.<ref>Michael R. Peres (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMJxyAwGvKcC&pg=PA779 ''The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography'', p. 779], [[Taylor & Francis]]</ref>\n\nIn the single-lens reflex camera, the photographer sees the scene through the camera lens. This avoids the problem of [[parallax]] which occurs when the viewfinder or viewing lens is separated from the taking lens. Single-lens reflex cameras have been made in several formats including sheet film 5x7\" and 4x5\", roll film 220/120 taking 8,10, 12 or 16 photographs on a 120 roll and twice that number of a 220 film. These correspond to 6x9, 6x7, 6x6 and 6x4.5 respectively (all dimensions in cm). Notable manufacturers of large format and roll film SLR cameras include [[Bronica]], [[Graflex]], [[Hasselblad]], [[Mamiya]], and Pentax. However the most common format of SLR cameras has been 35&nbsp;mm and subsequently the migration to [[digital SLR]] cameras, using almost identical sized bodies and sometimes using the same lens systems.\n\nAlmost all SLR cameras use a front surfaced mirror in the optical path to direct the light from the lens via a viewing screen and [[pentaprism]] to the eyepiece. At the time of exposure the mirror is flipped up out of the light path before the shutter opens. Some early cameras experimented with other methods of providing through-the-lens viewing, including the use of a semi-transparent [[Pellicle mirror|pellicle]] as in the [[Canon (company)|Canon]] ''Pellix''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/canon/fdresources/pellix/ |title=Canon Pellix Camera |work=Photography in Malaysia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016173448/http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/canon/fdresources/pellix/ |archivedate=16 October 2013}}</ref> and others with a small periscope such as in the [[K. G. Corfield Ltd|Corfield]] Periflex series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/Museum/CorfieldCameras/page3.htm |title=Corfield Cameras \u2013 The Periflex Era |last=Parker |first=Bev |publisher=Wolverhampton Museum of Industry}}</ref>\n\n=== Large-format camera ===\n{{Main|View camera}}\n\nThe large-format camera, taking sheet film, is a direct successor of the early plate cameras and remained in use for high quality photography and for technical, architectural and industrial photography. There are three common types, the view camera with its [[Monorail camera|monorail]] and [[field camera]] variants, and the [[press camera]]. They have an extensible bellows with the lens and shutter mounted on a lens plate at the front. Backs taking [[rollfilm]], and later [[digital back]]s are available in addition to the standard dark slide back. These cameras have a wide range of movements allowing very close control of focus and perspective. Composition and focusing is done on view cameras by viewing a [[ground-glass]] screen which is replaced by the film to make the exposure; they are suitable for static subjects only, and are slow to use.\n\n==== Plate camera ====\n[[File:Studijskifotoaparat.JPG|thumb|19th century studio camera, with bellows for focusing]]\n{{Main|Photographic plate}}\nThe earliest cameras produced in significant numbers used sensitised glass plates were ''plate cameras''. Light entered a lens mounted on a lens board which was separated from the plate by an extendible bellows.There were simple box cameras for glass plates but also single-lens reflex cameras with interchangeable lenses and even for color photography ([[Autochrome Lumi\u00e8re]]). Many of these cameras had controls to raise or lower the lens and to tilt it forwards or backwards to control perspective.\n\nFocusing of these plate cameras was by the use of a ground glass screen at the point of focus. Because [[Photographic lens design|lens design]] only allowed rather small aperture lenses, the image on the ground glass screen was faint and most photographers had a dark cloth to cover their heads to allow focussing and composition to be carried out more easily. When focus and composition were satisfactory, the ground glass screen was removed and a sensitised plate put in its place protected by a [[dark slide (photography)|dark slide]]. To make the exposure, the dark slide was carefully slid out and the shutter opened and then closed and the dark slide replaced.\n\nGlass plates were later replaced by sheet film in a dark slide for sheet film; adaptor sleeves were made to allow sheet film to be used in plate holders. In addition to the ground glass, a simple optical viewfinder was often fitted.\n\n=== Medium-format camera ===\n{{Main|Medium-format}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}Medium-format cameras have a film size between the large-format cameras and smaller 35&nbsp;mm cameras. Typically these systems use 120 or 220 rollfilm. The most common image sizes are 6\u00d74.5&nbsp;cm, 6\u00d76&nbsp;cm and 6\u00d77&nbsp;cm; the older 6\u00d79&nbsp;cm is rarely used. The designs of this kind of camera show greater variation than their larger brethren, ranging from monorail systems through the classic Hasselblad model with separate backs, to smaller rangefinder cameras. There are even compact amateur cameras available in this format.\n\n==== Twin-lens reflex camera ====\n[[File:Rolleiflex camera.jpg|thumb|Twin-lens reflex camera]]\n{{Main|Twin-lens reflex camera}}\n\nTwin-lens reflex cameras used a pair of nearly identical lenses, one to form the image and one as a viewfinder. The lenses were arranged with the viewing lens immediately above the taking lens. The viewing lens projects an image onto a viewing screen which can be seen from above. Some manufacturers such as Mamiya also provided a reflex head to attach to the viewing screen to allow the camera to be held to the eye when in use. The advantage of a TLR was that it could be easily focussed using the viewing screen and that under most circumstances the view seen in the viewing screen was identical to that recorded on film. At close distances however, parallax errors were encountered and some cameras also included an indicator to show what part of the composition would be excluded.\n\nSome TLR had interchangeable lenses but as these had to be paired lenses they were relatively heavy and did not provide the range of focal lengths that the SLR could support. Most TLRs used 120 or 220 film; some used the smaller 127 film.\n\n=== Compact cameras ===\n==== Instant camera ====\n{{Main|Instant camera}}\n\nAfter exposure every photograph is taken through pinch rollers inside of the instant camera. Thereby the developer paste contained in the paper 'sandwich' distributes on the image. After a minute, the cover sheet just needs to be removed and one gets a single original positive image with a fixed format. With some systems it was also possible to create an instant image negative, from which then could be made copies in the photo lab. The ultimate development was the SX-70 system of [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], in which a row of ten shots \u2013 engine driven \u2013 could be made without having to remove any cover sheets from the picture. There were instant cameras for a variety of formats, as well as adapters for instant film use in medium- and large-format cameras.\n\n==== Subminiature camera ====\n{{Main|Subminiature camera}}[[File:2016 Minox C 8.jpg|thumb|Subminiature spy camera]]\n\nCameras taking film significantly smaller than 35&nbsp;mm were made. Subminiature cameras were first produced in the nineteenth century. The expensive 8\u00d711&nbsp;mm [[Minox]], the only type of camera produced by the company from 1937 to 1976, became very widely known and was often used for espionage (the Minox company later also produced larger cameras). Later inexpensive subminiatures were made for general use, some using rewound 16&nbsp;mm cine film. Image quality with these small film sizes was limited.\n\n==== Folding camera ====\n{{Main|Folding camera}}\n\nThe introduction of films enabled the existing designs for plate cameras to be made much smaller and for the base-plate to be hinged so that it could be folded up compressing the bellows. These designs were very compact and small models were dubbed ''vest pocket'' cameras. Folding rollfilm cameras were preceded by folding plate cameras, more compact than other designs.\n\n==== Box camera ====\n{{Main|Box camera}}\n\nBox cameras were introduced as a budget level camera and had few if any controls. The original box Brownie models had a small reflex viewfinder mounted on the top of the camera and had no aperture or focusing controls and just a simple shutter. Later models such as the Brownie 127 had larger direct view optical viewfinders together with a curved film path to reduce the impact of deficiencies in the lens.\n\n=== Rangefinder camera ===\n[[File:Leica IIIa Rangefinder.jpg|thumb|Rangefinder camera, Leica c. 1936]]\n{{Main|Rangefinder camera}}\n\nAs camera a lens technology developed and wide aperture lenses became more common, [[rangefinder]] cameras were introduced to make focusing more precise. Early rangefinders had two separate viewfinder windows, one of which is linked to the focusing mechanisms and moved right or left as the focusing ring is turned. The two separate images are brought together on a ground glass viewing screen. When vertical lines in the object being photographed meet exactly in the combined image, the object is in focus. A normal composition viewfinder is also provided. Later the viewfinder and rangefinder were combined. Many rangefinder cameras had [[interchangeable lens]]es, each lens requiring its own range- and viewfinder linkages.\n\nRangefinder cameras were produced in [[Half-frame|half-]] and full-frame 35&nbsp;mm and rollfilm (medium format).\n\n=== Motion picture cameras ===\n{{Main|Movie camera}}\n{{See|Digital movie camera}}\n\nA [[movie camera]] or a [[video camera]] operates similarly to a still camera, except it records a series of static images in rapid succession, commonly at a [[frame rate|rate]] of 24 frames per second. When the images are combined and displayed in order, the illusion of motion is achieved.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/filmmakershandbo00asch_0 |title=The Filmmaker's Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide for the Digital Age |last1=Ascher |first1=Steven |last2=Pincus |first2=Edward |publisher=Penguin Group |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-452-28678-8 |edition=3 |location=New York |url-access=registration}}</ref>{{Rp|4}}\n\nCameras that capture many images in sequence are known as movie cameras or as cin\u00e9 cameras in Europe; those designed for single images are still cameras. However these categories overlap as still cameras are often used to capture moving images in [[special effect]]s work and many modern cameras can quickly switch between still and motion recording modes.\n\nA cin\u00e9 camera or movie camera takes a rapid sequence of photographs on image sensor or strips of film. In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot at a time, the cin\u00e9 camera takes a series of images, each called a \"frame\" through the use of an intermittent mechanism.\n\nThe frames are later played back in a cin\u00e9 projector at a specific speed, called the \"frame rate\" (number of frames per second). While viewing, a person's eyes and brain [[persistence of vision|merge the separate pictures]] to create the illusion of motion. The first cin\u00e9 camera was built around 1888 and by 1890 several types were being manufactured. The standard film size for cin\u00e9 cameras was quickly established as [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] and this remained in use until transition to digital cinematography. Other professional standard formats include [[70&nbsp;mm film]] and 16&nbsp;mm film whilst amateurs film makers used 9.5&nbsp;mm film, 8&nbsp;mm film or Standard 8 and Super 8 before the move into digital format.\n\nThe size and complexity of cin\u00e9 cameras varies greatly depending on the uses required of the camera. Some professional equipment is very large and too heavy to be hand held whilst some amateur cameras were designed to be very small and light for single-handed operation.\n\n==== Professional video camera ====\n[[File:Arri Alexa camera.jpg|thumb|[[Arri Alexa]], a digital movie camera]]\n{{Main|Professional video camera}}\n{{See|Video camera}}\n\nA professional video camera (often called a television camera even though the use has spread beyond television) is a high-end device for creating electronic moving images (as opposed to a movie camera, that earlier recorded the images on [[filmstock|film]]). Originally developed for use in television studios, they are now also used for music videos, [[direct-to-video]] movies, corporate and educational videos, marriage videos etc.\n\nThese cameras earlier used [[Video camera tube|vacuum tubes]] and later electronic [[image sensors]].\n\n==== Camcorders ====\n{{Main|Camcorders}}\n\nA camcorder is an electronic device combining a video camera and a video recorder. Although marketing materials may use the colloquial term \"camcorder\", the name on the package and manual is often \"video camera recorder\".

Most digital cameras can also record moving videos with [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound]]. Some digital cameras can [[Cropping (image)|crop]] and [[Image stitching|stitch]] pictures and perform other elementary [[image editing]].\n\nConsumers adopted digital cameras in 1990s. Professional video cameras transitioned to digital around the 2000s\u20132010s. Finally movie cameras transitioned to digital in the 2010s.\n\nThe first camera using digital electronics to capture and store images was developed by Kodak engineer [[Steven Sasson]] in 1975.

Wirehaired dachshunds are the least common coat variety in the United States (although it is the most common in Germany) and the most recent coat to appear in breeding standards.<ref name=\"gkpnso\" />\nDachshunds have a wide variety of colors and patterns, the most common one being red. Their base coloration can be single-colored (either red or cream), tan pointed (black and tan, chocolate and tan, blue and tan, or [[Isabelline (colour)|isabella]] and tan), and in wirehaired dogs, a color referred to as wildboar. Patterns such as dapple (merle), sable, brindle and piebald also can occur on any of the base colors. Dachshunds in the same litter may be born in different coat colors depending on the genetic makeup of the parents. \n\nThe dominant color in the breed is red, followed by black and tan. Tan pointed dogs have tan (or cream) markings over the eyes, ears, paws, and tail.  The reds range from coppers to deep rusts, with or without somewhat common black hairs peppered along the back, face and ear edges, lending much character and an almost burnished appearance; this is referred to among breeders and enthusiasts as an \"overlay\" or \"sabling\". Sabling should not be confused with a more unusual coat color referred to as sable. At a distance, a sable dachshund looks somewhat like a black and tan dog. Upon closer examination, however, one can observe that along the top of the dog's body, each hair is actually banded with red at the base near the skin transitioning to mostly black along the length of the strand. An additional striking coat marking is the brindle pattern. \"Brindle\" refers to dark stripes over a solid background\u2014usually red. If a dachshund is brindled on a dark coat and has tan points, it will have brindling on the tan points only. Even one single, lone stripe of brindle is a brindle. If a dachshund has one single spot of dapple, it is a dapple.\n\nThe Dachshund Club of America (DCA) and the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) consider both the piebald pattern and the double dapple (double merle) pattern to be nonstandard. However, both types continue to be shown and sometimes even win in the conformation ring.\n\nDogs that are double-dappled have the merle pattern of a dapple, but with distinct white patches that occur when the dapple gene expresses itself twice in the same area of the coat. The DCA excluded the wording \"double-dapple\" from the standard in 2007 and now strictly uses the wording \"dapple\" as the double dapple gene is commonly responsible for blindness and deafness.\n\n<gallery caption=\"There are three types of dachshund, which can be classified by their coats: short-haired, called 'smooth'; long-haired; and wire-haired\">\nFile:Wirehaired Dachshund.jpg|A wirehaired dachshund\nFile:Kurzhaardackel.jpg|A smooth dachshund\nStd Dachshund 600.jpg|A longhaired dachshund\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Examples of different types of dapple patterning\">\nFile:Dave the dachshund.jpg|Chocolate and tan dapple smooth-haired dachshund.\nFile:Silver Dapple Smooth Haired Miniature Dachshund.jpg|Black and tan double dapple smooth-haired miniature dachshund with one blue eye and one brown eye\nFile:Parti-colour Longhaired Dachshund.jpg|A double dapple longhaired dachshund\n\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Black & Tan Brindle Dachshund.jpg|thumb|A black and tan miniature dachshund with brindle markings]]\n\n==== Size ====\nDachshunds come in three sizes: standard, miniature,<ref name=\"gkpnso\">{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/#standard |title=Dachshund Breed Standard |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessdate=3 February 2009}}</ref> and ''kaninchen'' (German for \"rabbit\").

One theory is that smooth dachshunds would occasionally produce puppies which had slightly longer hair than their parents. By selectively breeding these animals, breeders eventually produced a dog which consistently produced long-haired offspring, and the long-haired dachshund was born. Another theory is that the standard long-haired dachshund was developed by breeding smooth dachshunds with various land and water spaniels. The long-haired dachshund may be a cross among any of the small dog breeds in the spaniel group, including the [[German Spaniel|German Stoeberhund]], and the smooth dachshund.<ref name=\"DCA\" />\n\nThe wire-haired dachshund, the last to develop, was bred in the late 19th century. There is a possibility the wire-haired dachshund was a cross between the smooth dachshund and various hard-coated terriers and wire-haired pinschers, such as the [[Schnauzer]], the [[Dandie Dinmont Terrier]], the [[German Wirehaired Pointer]], or perhaps the [[Scottish Terrier]].<ref name=\"DCA\" /><ref name=\"Critter\">{{cite web |title=Dachshund Breed Resources |url=http://www.furrycritter.com/resources/dogs/Dachshund.htm |work=FurryCritterNetwork |accessdate=16 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417235345/http://www.furrycritter.com/resources/dogs/Dachshund.htm |archive-date=17 April 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Symbol of Germany ==\nDachshunds have traditionally been viewed as a symbol of Germany.

As a result, they were often called \"liberty hounds\" by their owners similar to \"liberty cabbage\" becoming a term for sauerkraut mostly in North America.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Sort of Life |last=Green |first=Graham |pages=49 |url=http://richardshepherd.net/2006/ClaudiasSunangel.html}}</ref> The stigma of the association was revived to a lesser extent during [[World War II]], though it was comparatively short-lived. Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] and German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] were known for keeping dachshunds.\n\nDue to the association of the breed with Germany, as well as its particular popularity among dog keepers in Munich back then, the dachshund was chosen to be the first official [[mascot]] for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, with the name [[Waldi]].<ref name=\"higher\">{{cite web |url=http://www.swifterhigher.com/2008/07/meet-the-mascots-waldi-munich.php |title=Meet the Mascots: Waldi (Munich 1972) |author=Whelliston, Kyle |date=8 July 2008 |publisher=Swifter Higher |accessdate=7 January 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100308075540/http://swifterhigher.com/2008/07/meet-the-mascots-waldi-munich.php\n|archivedate = 8 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Short haired dachshund in race.jpg|thumb|A smooth dachshund in an organized race]]\nSome people train and enter their dachshunds to compete in [[Dachshund racing|dachshund races]], such as the [[Wiener Nationals]]. Several races across the United States routinely draw several thousand attendees, including races in [[Germantown, Tennessee]]; [[Bossier City, Louisiana]]; [[Buda, Texas]]; [[Davis, California]]; [[Phoenix, Arizona]]; [[Los Alamitos, California]]; [[Findlay, Ohio]]; [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]; [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]; [[Kansas City, Kansas]]; [[Palo Alto, California]]; and [[Shakopee, Minnesota]]. There is also an annual dachshund run in [[Kennywood]], located in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], called the Wiener 100, in [[Huntington, West Virginia]] called the Dachshund Dash and in [[Lovettsville, Virginia]] as part of the town's annual Oktoberfest celebration.<ref>https://loudounnow.com/2017/09/19/short-on-legs-long-on-competition-its-the-2017-wiener-dog-races/</ref>\n\nDespite the popularity of these events, the Dachshund Club of America opposes \"wiener racing\", as many greyhound tracks use the events to draw large crowds to their facilities. The DCA is also worried about potential injuries to dogs, due to their predisposition to back injuries. Another favorite sport is [[earthdog trial]]s, in which dachshunds enter tunnels with dead ends and obstacles attempting to locate either an artificial bait or live but caged (and thus protected) rats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Earthdog Den Trials |publisher=Canada's Guide to Dogs |url=http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/clubs/earthdog.htm |accessdate=16 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n== ''Dackel'' versus ''Teckel'' ==\nIn Germany, dachshunds are widely called ''Dackel'' (both singular and plural). Among hunters, they are mainly referred to as ''Teckel''. There are [[kennel]]s which specialize in breeding hunting dachshunds, the so-called ''jagdliche Leistungszucht'' (\"hunting-related performance breed\") or ''Gebrauchshundezucht'' (\"working dog breed\"), as opposed to breeding family dogs.

Wirehaired dachshunds are the least common coat variety in the United States (although it is the most common in Germany) and the most recent coat to appear in breeding standards.<ref name=\"gkpnso\" />\nDachshunds have a wide variety of colors and patterns, the most common one being red. Their base coloration can be single-colored (either red or cream), tan pointed (black and tan, chocolate and tan, blue and tan, or [[Isabelline (colour)|isabella]] and tan), and in wirehaired dogs, a color referred to as wildboar. Patterns such as dapple (merle), sable, brindle and piebald also can occur on any of the base colors. Dachshunds in the same litter may be born in different coat colors depending on the genetic makeup of the parents. \n\nThe dominant color in the breed is red, followed by black and tan. Tan pointed dogs have tan (or cream) markings over the eyes, ears, paws, and tail.  The reds range from coppers to deep rusts, with or without somewhat common black hairs peppered along the back, face and ear edges, lending much character and an almost burnished appearance; this is referred to among breeders and enthusiasts as an \"overlay\" or \"sabling\". Sabling should not be confused with a more unusual coat color referred to as sable. At a distance, a sable dachshund looks somewhat like a black and tan dog. Upon closer examination, however, one can observe that along the top of the dog's body, each hair is actually banded with red at the base near the skin transitioning to mostly black along the length of the strand. An additional striking coat marking is the brindle pattern. \"Brindle\" refers to dark stripes over a solid background\u2014usually red. If a dachshund is brindled on a dark coat and has tan points, it will have brindling on the tan points only. Even one single, lone stripe of brindle is a brindle. If a dachshund has one single spot of dapple, it is a dapple.\n\nThe Dachshund Club of America (DCA) and the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) consider both the piebald pattern and the double dapple (double merle) pattern to be nonstandard. However, both types continue to be shown and sometimes even win in the conformation ring.\n\nDogs that are double-dappled have the merle pattern of a dapple, but with distinct white patches that occur when the dapple gene expresses itself twice in the same area of the coat. The DCA excluded the wording \"double-dapple\" from the standard in 2007 and now strictly uses the wording \"dapple\" as the double dapple gene is commonly responsible for blindness and deafness.\n\n<gallery caption=\"There are three types of dachshund, which can be classified by their coats: short-haired, called 'smooth'; long-haired; and wire-haired\">\nFile:Wirehaired Dachshund.jpg|A wirehaired dachshund\nFile:Kurzhaardackel.jpg|A smooth dachshund\nStd Dachshund 600.jpg|A longhaired dachshund\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Examples of different types of dapple patterning\">\nFile:Dave the dachshund.jpg|Chocolate and tan dapple smooth-haired dachshund.\nFile:Silver Dapple Smooth Haired Miniature Dachshund.jpg|Black and tan double dapple smooth-haired miniature dachshund with one blue eye and one brown eye\nFile:Parti-colour Longhaired Dachshund.jpg|A double dapple longhaired dachshund\n\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Black & Tan Brindle Dachshund.jpg|thumb|A black and tan miniature dachshund with brindle markings]]\n\n==== Size ====\nDachshunds come in three sizes: standard, miniature,<ref name=\"gkpnso\">{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/#standard |title=Dachshund Breed Standard |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessdate=3 February 2009}}</ref> and ''kaninchen'' (German for \"rabbit\").

According to William Loeffler, from '' The American Book of the Dog (1891)'', in the chapter on dachshunds: \"The origin of the Dachshund is in doubt, our best authorities disagreeing as to the beginning of the breed.\"<ref name=\"Sheilds\" /> What can be agreed on, however, is that the smooth dachshund gave rise to both the long-haired and the wire-haired varieties.\n\nThere are two theories about how the standard long-haired dachshund came about. One theory is that smooth dachshunds would occasionally produce puppies which had slightly longer hair than their parents. By selectively breeding these animals, breeders eventually produced a dog which consistently produced long-haired offspring, and the long-haired dachshund was born. Another theory is that the standard long-haired dachshund was developed by breeding smooth dachshunds with various land and water spaniels. The long-haired dachshund may be a cross among any of the small dog breeds in the spaniel group, including the [[German Spaniel|German Stoeberhund]], and the smooth dachshund.<ref name=\"DCA\" />\n\nThe wire-haired dachshund, the last to develop, was bred in the late 19th century. There is a possibility the wire-haired dachshund was a cross between the smooth dachshund and various hard-coated terriers and wire-haired pinschers, such as the [[Schnauzer]], the [[Dandie Dinmont Terrier]], the [[German Wirehaired Pointer]], or perhaps the [[Scottish Terrier]].<ref name=\"DCA\" /><ref name=\"Critter\">{{cite web |title=Dachshund Breed Resources |url=http://www.furrycritter.com/resources/dogs/Dachshund.htm |work=FurryCritterNetwork |accessdate=16 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417235345/http://www.furrycritter.com/resources/dogs/Dachshund.htm |archive-date=17 April 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Symbol of Germany ==\nDachshunds have traditionally been viewed as a symbol of Germany.

Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] and German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] were known for keeping dachshunds.\n\nDue to the association of the breed with Germany, as well as its particular popularity among dog keepers in Munich back then, the dachshund was chosen to be the first official [[mascot]] for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, with the name [[Waldi]].<ref name=\"higher\">{{cite web |url=http://www.swifterhigher.com/2008/07/meet-the-mascots-waldi-munich.php |title=Meet the Mascots: Waldi (Munich 1972) |author=Whelliston, Kyle |date=8 July 2008 |publisher=Swifter Higher |accessdate=7 January 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100308075540/http://swifterhigher.com/2008/07/meet-the-mascots-waldi-munich.php\n|archivedate = 8 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Short haired dachshund in race.jpg|thumb|A smooth dachshund in an organized race]]\nSome people train and enter their dachshunds to compete in [[Dachshund racing|dachshund races]], such as the [[Wiener Nationals]].

The DCA is also worried about potential injuries to dogs, due to their predisposition to back injuries. Another favorite sport is [[earthdog trial]]s, in which dachshunds enter tunnels with dead ends and obstacles attempting to locate either an artificial bait or live but caged (and thus protected) rats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Earthdog Den Trials |publisher=Canada's Guide to Dogs |url=http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/clubs/earthdog.htm |accessdate=16 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n== ''Dackel'' versus ''Teckel'' ==\nIn Germany, dachshunds are widely called ''Dackel'' (both singular and plural).

There are [[kennel]]s which specialize in breeding hunting dachshunds, the so-called ''jagdliche Leistungszucht'' (\"hunting-related performance breed\") or ''Gebrauchshundezucht'' (\"working dog breed\"), as opposed to breeding family dogs.
