The wide range of media campaigns to inform the public about the disease has definitely paid off as it has helped achieve behavioral change. Prevention measures like the use of condoms have shot up starkly with increased awareness on the disease and advertising urging [[safe sex]] practices and condom use.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> The government's collaboration with local and international governmental and nongovernmental organizations has also positively influenced access to HIV/AIDS related service centers.<ref name=\"AIGA\" />\n\n=== Family planning ===\nUnder Tedros' tenure, the unmet need for family planning in Ethiopia has declined, and the contraceptive prevalence rate has doubled in 5 years.

The dam was expected to have a reservoir of around 70&nbsp;billion cubic meters, which was scheduled to start filling in 2014.

After spending time in London, Toronto, Tokyo and Paris, he lived for a long time in Brussels.\n\nHe is best known for a series of graphic novels he published while living in Canada in the 1970s: ''Elephant'' (1970), ''The Projector'' (1971), ''The Park'' (1972) and ''The Cage'' (1975). ''The Cage'' is perhaps his best known work, the subject of critical study, including a monograph by French critic Thierry Groensteen, ''La construction de la cage'' (Impressions Nouvelles, 2002), and has been reprinted in several editions in French and English.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s, Vaughn-James devoted himself primarily to painting, exhibiting regularly in France, Belgium and Germany. He was the co-founder with the painter Hastaire of the Groupe M\u00e9moires (1999) group of painters.\n\n==Biography==\n\nSon of Clifford Howard James, an itinerant teacher, and Kathleen Florence Stevens,  he was born in Bristol, England on December 5, 1943. He and his family moved to Australia in 1958 where he studied for four years at the [[National Art School]] in Sydney. On May 3, 1967 he married poet Sarah MacCoy (Noddy), in [[Kensington]], [[London]].\n\nIn 1968, the couple emigrated to [[Toronto]], Canada.\n\nAfter returning to England in 1977, in September 1978, they settled permanently in France in Paris. In 1991, they moved to \"domaine de la H\u00eatraie\" in [[Doudeville]], and then to \"La Cour Rabault\" in [[Calvados (d\u00e9partement)|Calvados]] at [[La Chapelle-Yvon]]. They returned to Paris in 1995.\n\nIn 2006, after selling their Parisian apartment, they emigrated again, to live in place Louis Morichar [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium]].\n\nHe died in Provence on July 3, 2009.\n\n==Graphic Novels==\n\nWhile living in Toronto, Vaughn-James published his first surrealist cartoon <ref>{{cite magazine |last=Vaughn-James |first=Martin |date=1968-09-02 |title=cartoon |page=36 |url= |magazine=[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]] |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref> in the monthly [[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]] magazine.  He would go on to provide monthly cartoons and comic strips (from one to eight panels without text) for the magazine until August 1980. From May, 1970, he also contributed many illustrations for articles, beginning with Myrna Kostash's \"Canada's no place to be a guerrilla\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Kotash |first=Myrna |date=1970-05-02 |title=Canada's no place to be a guerilla|page=54|url= |magazine=[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]] |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn the same issue appeared an ad for Vaughn-James' ''Elephant'', published by New Press [84 Sussex avenue, Toronto 179] for $3.50, and advertised as a \"boovie\", Vaughn-James's [[neologism]] combining the words \"book\" and \"movie\". In Vaughn-James's words from the ad:<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Vaughn-James |first=Martin |date=1970-05-02 |title=Elephant ad|page=134 |url= |magazine=[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]] |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\u00ab The age of reason has inflicted man with an asphyxia of the mind. We live in an age of corporate bodies. We experience collectively approved emotions on a national scale. Any deviation is considered neurotic, insane or subversive. Our individual vision has been sacrificed for an amazingly limited range of collective perceptions which we learn from childhood by repetition and limitation the way a parrot learns to swear. Our society believes in words, not people or things. We are abstract. When we perceive an object or person or feeling we see a word first, and, if we are not already too far gone, the thing later. Our world is no longer populated with trees and storms and stones and blood but the words \u00ab trees \u00bb, \u00ab storms \u00bb, \u00ab stones \u00bb, \u00ab blood \u00bb. Our mania for equality and affluence achieved through systems of logic and order has meant that we must reject our natural chaos and all accept the same way of perceiving the so-called \u00ab real-world \u00bb. Elephant is NOT a fantasy. The modern world is a fantasy; a fantasy of our reason, our logic, our insistence on problems and solutions. Elephant is a man living subjectively, illogically and mysteriously. Elephant is a confused whimper in a corridor of steam-irons and bank buildings. Elephant is a heart in a cardboard box, its beat almost inaudible as it stands in an empty parking-lot \u00bb</blockquote>\n\nFour pages of the book are previewed in the June, 1970 issue of The Canadian Forum, alongside Vaughn-James' explication of the term \"boovie\":<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Vaughn-James |first=Martin |date=June 1970 |title=Elephant |page=134 |url= |magazine=[[Canadian Forum]] |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\u00ab The boovie: it is not a book, not a comic-strip, not a de-animated cartoon, not a scenario for a film. It is a new form, which, granted, like any new form owes something to those already in existence. The Boovie is primarily a visual experience. The book has been transformed into an object in its own right. It is not, anu more, an abstract vehicle for ideas or feelings with no existence of its own, but a thing in itself. Unlike certain other forms (painting) it is truly democratic for it is a multiple object available to all in the same form at the same price. It exists in time, like the novel and the film, and in space, like the painting and  the sculpture. Art is Anarchy of the Spirit. \u00bb</blockquote>\n\nThe book itself is essentially a comic, with large, full-page panels and minimal text, and using many tools of the cartoonist.

After spending time in London, Toronto, Tokyo and Paris, he lived for a long time in Brussels.\n\nHe is best known for a series of graphic novels he published while living in Canada in the 1970s: ''Elephant'' (1970), ''The Projector'' (1971), ''The Park'' (1972) and ''The Cage'' (1975). ''The Cage'' is perhaps his best known work, the subject of critical study, including a monograph by French critic Thierry Groensteen, ''La construction de la cage'' (Impressions Nouvelles, 2002), and has been reprinted in several editions in French and English.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s, Vaughn-James devoted himself primarily to painting, exhibiting regularly in France, Belgium and Germany. He was the co-founder with the painter Hastaire of the Groupe M\u00e9moires (1999) group of painters.\n\n==Biography==\n\nSon of Clifford Howard James, an itinerant teacher, and Kathleen Florence Stevens,  he was born in Bristol, England on December 5, 1943. He and his family moved to Australia in 1958 where he studied for four years at the [[National Art School]] in Sydney. On May 3, 1967 he married poet Sarah MacCoy (Noddy), in [[Kensington]], [[London]].\n\nIn 1968, the couple emigrated to [[Toronto]], Canada.\n\nAfter returning to England in 1977, in September 1978, they settled permanently in France in Paris. In 1991, they moved to \"domaine de la H\u00eatraie\" in [[Doudeville]], and then to \"La Cour Rabault\" in [[Calvados (d\u00e9partement)|Calvados]] at [[La Chapelle-Yvon]]. They returned to Paris in 1995.\n\nIn 2006, after selling their Parisian apartment, they emigrated again, to live in place Louis Morichar [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium]].\n\nHe died in Provence on July 3, 2009.\n\n==Graphic Novels==\n\nWhile living in Toronto, Vaughn-James published his first surrealist cartoon <ref>{{cite magazine |last=Vaughn-James |first=Martin |date=1968-09-02 |title=cartoon |page=36 |url= |magazine=[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]] |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref> in the monthly [[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]] magazine.  He would go on to provide monthly cartoons and comic strips (from one to eight panels without text) for the magazine until August 1980. From May, 1970, he also contributed many illustrations for articles, beginning with Myrna Kostash's \"Canada's no place to be a guerrilla\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Kotash |first=Myrna |date=1970-05-02 |title=Canada's no place to be a guerilla|page=54|url= |magazine=[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]] |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn the same issue appeared an ad for Vaughn-James' ''Elephant'', published by New Press [84 Sussex avenue, Toronto 179] for $3.50, and advertised as a \"boovie\", Vaughn-James's [[neologism]] combining the words \"book\" and \"movie\". In Vaughn-James's words from the ad:<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Vaughn-James |first=Martin |date=1970-05-02 |title=Elephant ad|page=134 |url= |magazine=[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]] |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\u00ab The age of reason has inflicted man with an asphyxia of the mind. We live in an age of corporate bodies. We experience collectively approved emotions on a national scale. Any deviation is considered neurotic, insane or subversive. Our individual vision has been sacrificed for an amazingly limited range of collective perceptions which we learn from childhood by repetition and limitation the way a parrot learns to swear. Our society believes in words, not people or things. We are abstract. When we perceive an object or person or feeling we see a word first, and, if we are not already too far gone, the thing later. Our world is no longer populated with trees and storms and stones and blood but the words \u00ab trees \u00bb, \u00ab storms \u00bb, \u00ab stones \u00bb, \u00ab blood \u00bb. Our mania for equality and affluence achieved through systems of logic and order has meant that we must reject our natural chaos and all accept the same way of perceiving the so-called \u00ab real-world \u00bb. Elephant is NOT a fantasy. The modern world is a fantasy; a fantasy of our reason, our logic, our insistence on problems and solutions. Elephant is a man living subjectively, illogically and mysteriously. Elephant is a confused whimper in a corridor of steam-irons and bank buildings. Elephant is a heart in a cardboard box, its beat almost inaudible as it stands in an empty parking-lot \u00bb</blockquote>\n\nFour pages of the book are previewed in the June, 1970 issue of The Canadian Forum, alongside Vaughn-James' explication of the term \"boovie\":<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Vaughn-James |first=Martin |date=June 1970 |title=Elephant |page=134 |url= |magazine=[[Canadian Forum]] |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\u00ab The boovie: it is not a book, not a comic-strip, not a de-animated cartoon, not a scenario for a film. It is a new form, wich, granted, like any new form owes something to those already in existence. The Boovie is primarily a visual experience. The book has been transformed into an object in its own right. It is not, anu more, an abstract vehicle for ideas or feelings with no existence of its own, but a thing in itself. Unlike certain other forms (painting) it is truly democratic for it is a multiple object available to all in the same form at the same price. It exists in time, like the novel and the film, and in space, like the painting and  the sculpture. Art is Anarchy of the Spirit. \u00bb</blockquote>\n\nThe book itself is essentially a comic, with large, full-page panels and minimal text, and using many tools of the cartoonist. As the critic Andrei Molotui notes, \"\"Elephant,\" especially, can be seen as a (non-proto) graphic novel, arising directly out of the underground comix movement. Admittedly, it is experimental, and it substitutes a kind of modernist strangeness for the usual humor of the underground; nevertheless, it is in complete control of the language of comics.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicscomicsmag.com/?p=586#comment-3761 |title=comment on The Proto-Graphic Novel: Notes on a Form |last=Molotui |first=Andrei |date=2009-10-20 |website=comicscomicsmag.com |publisher=Comics Comics Magazine |access-date=2018-10-23 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nVaughn-James' next book was published by Toronto's [[Coach House Books]] in 1971.

A commercial version with different morality lessons, '''''Chutes and Ladders''''', has been published by Milton Bradley since the 1940s.\n\n==Equipment==\nThe size of the grid (most commonly 8\u00d78, 10\u00d710 or 12\u00d712) varies, as does the exact arrangement of the snakes and ladders, with both factors affecting the duration of play. Each player is represented by a distinctly coloured game piece token. A single die <!-- one \"die\" in this description, not \"dice\" (plural) --> is rolled to determine random movement of a player's token in the traditional form of play.\n\n==History==\nSnakes and Ladders [[List of Indian inventions|originated in India]] as part of a family of dice board games that included [[Gyan chauper]] and [[pachisi]] (present-day [[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]] and ''[[Parcheesi]]'').  The game made its way to England and was sold as \"Snakes and Ladders\",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=Chutes and Ladders from Milton Bradley (1943)|url=https://toytales.ca/chutes-ladders-milton-bradley-1943/|website=ToyTales.ca}}</ref> then the basic concept was introduced in the United States as ''Chutes and Ladders'' (an \"improved new version of England's famous indoor sport\"<ref name=\"Mathematical Gazette\"/>) by game pioneer [[Milton Bradley]] in 1943.<ref name=Augustyn/>\n\n[[File:Gyan chaupar.JPG|thumb|Gyan Chaupar ([[Jainism|Jain]] version of the game), [[National Museum, New Delhi]]]]\nGyan chauper/Jnan chauper (game of wisdom), the version associated with the [[Jain philosophy]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bornet|first1=Philippe|last2=Burger|first2=Maya|title=Religions in Play: Games, Rituals, and Virtual Worlds|date=2012|publisher=Theologischer Verlag Z\u00fcrich|isbn=9783290220105|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t3X18dopUoMC}}</ref> encompassed the concepts like ''[[Karma in Jainism|karma]]'' and ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]''.\n\nThe game was popular in ancient India by the name ''Moksha Patam''. It was also associated with traditional [[Hindu philosophy]] contrasting ''karma'' and kama, or destiny and desire. It emphasized destiny, as opposed to games such as pachisi, which focused on life as a mixture of skill (free will<ref>{{cite web |url=http://devdutt.com/articles/indian-mythology/playing-with-fate-and-free-will.html |title=Playing with fate and free will |publisher=Devdutt Pattanaik |date=September 17, 2007}}</ref>) and luck. The underlying ideals of the game inspired a version introduced in [[Victorian England]] in 1892. The game has also been interpreted and used as a tool for teaching the effects of good deeds versus bad. The board was covered with symbolic images, the top featuring gods, angels, and majestic beings, while the rest of the board was covered with pictures of animals, flowers and people.<ref name=\"BBB\">{{cite book  |last=Bell  |first=R. C.  |authorlink=Robert Charles Bell  |title=The Boardgame Book  |publisher=Exeter Books  |year=1983  |chapter=Snakes and Ladders  |pages=134\u201335  |isbn=0-671-06030-9}}</ref>  The ladders represented virtues such as generosity, faith, and humility, while the snakes represented vices such as lust, anger, murder, and theft.  The morality lesson of the game was that a person can attain salvation ([[Moksha]]) through doing good, whereas by doing evil one will inherit [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] to lower forms of life. The number of ladders was less than the number of snakes as a reminder that a path of good is much more difficult to tread than a path of sins. Presumably, reaching the last square (number 100) represented the attainment of ''Moksha'' (spiritual liberation).\n\nWhen the game was brought to England, the Indian virtues and vices were replaced by English ones in hopes of better reflecting Victorian doctrines of morality. Squares of Fulfillment, Grace and Success were accessible by ladders of Thrift, Penitence and Industry and snakes of Indulgence, Disobedience and Indolence caused one to end up in Illness, Disgrace and Poverty. While the Indian version of the game had snakes outnumbering ladders, the English counterpart was more forgiving as it contained each in the same amount.<ref name=\"changes\">Masters, James. \"Moksha-Patamu (Snakes and Ladders).\" The Online Guide to Traditional Games. N.p., n.d. Web.</ref> This concept of equality signifies the cultural ideal that for every sin one commits, there exists another chance at redemption.\n\nThe association of Britain's Snakes and Ladders with India and gyan chauper began with the returning of colonial families from one of Britain's most important imperial possessions, India. The d\u00e9cor and art of the early English boards of the 20th century reflect this relationship. By the 1940s, very few pictorial references to the Indian culture were found due to the economic demands of the war and the collapse of British rule in India.<ref name=\"topsfield\"/> Although the game's sense of morality has lasted through the game's generations, the physical allusions to religious and philosophical thought in the game as presented in Indian models appear to have all but faded. There has even been evidence of a possible Buddhist version of the game existing in India during the Pala-Sena time period.\n\nIn [[Andhra Pradesh]], this game is popularly called ''Vaikunthapali'' or ''Paramapada Sopana Patam'' (the ladder to salvation)  in Telugu.<ref name=Augustyn>Augustyn (2004), pp. 27\u201328</ref><ref name=\"topsfield\">{{cite book|last=Topsfield|first=Andrew|year=2006|title=The art of play. Board and card games of India|isbn=9788185026763|publisher=Marg Publications}}</ref> In Hindi, this game is called ''Saanp aur Seedhi'', ''Saanp Seedhi''  and ''Mokshapat''. In [[Tamil Nadu]] the game is called ''Parama padam'' and is often played by devotees of [[Hindu]]  god [[Vishnu]] during the [[Vaikuntha Ekadashi]] festival in order to stay awake during the night.\n\nIn the original game the squares of virtue are: ''Faith'' (12), ''Reliability'' (51), ''Generosity'' (57), ''Knowledge'' (76), and ''Asceticism'' (78).  The squares of vice or evil are: ''Disobedience'' (41), ''Vanity'' (44), ''Vulgarity'' (49), ''Theft'' (52), ''Lying'' (58), ''Drunkenness'' (62), ''Debt'' (69), ''Murder'' (73), ''Rage'' (84), ''Greed'' (92), ''Pride'' (95), and ''Lust'' (99).<ref name=\"BBB\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Cnl03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Milton Bradley ''Chutes and Ladders'' gameboard {{circa|1952}}. The illustrations show good deeds and their rewards; bad deeds and their consequences.]]\n\nEach player starts with a token on the starting square (usually the \"1\" grid square in the bottom left corner, or simply, off the board next to the \"1\" grid square). Players take turns rolling a single [[Dice|die]] to move their token by the number of squares indicated by the die roll. Tokens follow a fixed route marked on the gameboard which usually follows a [[boustrophedon]] (ox-plow) track from the bottom to the top of the playing area, passing once through every square. If, on completion of a move, a player's token lands on the lower-numbered end of a \"ladder\", the player moves the token up to the ladder's higher-numbered square. If the player lands on the higher-numbered square of a \"snake\" (or chute), the token must be moved down to the snake's lower-numbered square.\n\nIf a player rolls a ''6'', the player may, after moving, immediately take another turn; otherwise play passes to the next player in turn. The player who is first to bring their token to the last square of the track is the winner.\n\n===Variations===\nVariants exists where a player must roll the exact number to reach the final square. Depending on the variation, if the die roll is too large, the token either remains in place or goes off the final square and back again. (For example, if a player requiring a ''3'' to win rolls a ''5'', the token moves forward three spaces, then back two spaces.) In certain circumstances (such as a player rolling a ''6'' when a ''1'' is required to win), a player can end up further away from the final square after their move, than before it.\n\nIn the book ''[[Winning Ways]]'' the authors propose a variant which they call ''Adders-and-Ladders'' and which, unlike the original game, involves skill. Instead of tokens for each player, there is a store of indistinguishable tokens shared by all players. The illustration has five tokens (and a five by five board). There is no die to roll; instead, the player chooses any token and moves it one to four spaces. Whoever moves the last token to the Home space (i.e. the last number) wins.<ref>https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/951182/rules-adders-ladders</ref>\n\n==Specific editions==\nThe most widely known edition of Snakes and Ladders in the United States is ''Chutes and Ladders'' released by [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]] in 1943.<ref name=\"slesin\">Slesin, Suzanne.

The theme of the board design is [[playground]] equipment, showing children climbing ladders and descending chutes.\n\nThe artwork on the board teaches [[morality]] lessons: squares on the bottom of the ladders show a child doing a good or sensible deed, at the top of the ladder there is an image of the child enjoying the reward; squares at the top of the chutes show children engaging in mischievous or foolish behavior, on the bottom of the chute the image shows the children suffering the consequences.\n\nBlack children were depicted in the Milton Bradley game for the first time in 1974.<ref name=\"slesin\" /> There have been many pop culture versions of the game, with graphics featuring such children's television characters as ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]''. It has been marketed as \"The Classic Up and Down Game for Preschoolers\". In 1999, Hasbro released Chutes and Ladders for PCs.\n\nIn Canada the game has been traditionally sold as \"Snakes and Ladders\", and produced by the [[Canada Games Company]].

A commercial version with different morality lessons, '''''Chutes and Ladders''''', has been published by Milton Bradley since the 1940s.\n\n==Equipment==\nThe size of the grid (most commonly 8\u00d78, 10\u00d710 or 12\u00d712) varies, as does the exact arrangement of the snakes and ladders, with both factors affecting the duration of play. Each player is represented by a distinctly coloured game piece token. A single die <!-- one \"die\" in this description, not \"dice\" (plural) --> is rolled to determine random movement of a player's token in the traditional form of play.\n\n==History==\nSnakes and Ladders [[List of Indian inventions|originated in India]] as part of a family of dice board games that included [[Gyan chauper]] and [[pachisi]] (present-day [[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]] and ''[[Parcheesi]]'').  The game made its way to England and was sold as \"Snakes and Ladders\",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=Chutes and Ladders from Milton Bradley (1943)|url=https://toytales.ca/chutes-ladders-milton-bradley-1943/|website=ToyTales.ca}}</ref> then the basic concept was introduced in the United States as ''Chutes and Ladders'' (an \"improved new version of England's famous indoor sport\"<ref name=\"Mathematical Gazette\"/>) by game pioneer [[Milton Bradley]] in 1943.<ref name=Augustyn/>\n\n[[File:Gyan chaupar.JPG|thumb|Gyan Chaupar ([[Jainism|Jain]] version of the game), [[National Museum, New Delhi]]]]\nGyan chauper/Jnan chauper (game of wisdom), the version associated with the [[Jain philosophy]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bornet|first1=Philippe|last2=Burger|first2=Maya|title=Religions in Play: Games, Rituals, and Virtual Worlds|date=2012|publisher=Theologischer Verlag Z\u00fcrich|isbn=9783290220105|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t3X18dopUoMC}}</ref> encompassed the concepts like ''[[Karma in Jainism|karma]]'' and ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]''.\n\nThe game was popular in ancient India by the name ''Moksha Patam''. It was also associated with traditional [[Hindu philosophy]] contrasting ''karma'' and kama, or destiny and desire. It emphasized destiny, as opposed to games such as pachisi, which focused on life as a mixture of skill (free will<ref>{{cite web |url=http://devdutt.com/articles/indian-mythology/playing-with-fate-and-free-will.html |title=Playing with fate and free will |publisher=Devdutt Pattanaik |date=September 17, 2007}}</ref>) and luck. The underlying ideals of the game inspired a version introduced in [[Victorian England]] in 1892. The game has also been interpreted and used as a tool for teaching the effects of good deeds versus bad. The board was covered with symbolic images, the top featuring gods, angels, and majestic beings, while the rest of the board was covered with pictures of animals, flowers and people.<ref name=\"BBB\">{{cite book  |last=Bell  |first=R. C.  |authorlink=Robert Charles Bell  |title=The Boardgame Book  |publisher=Exeter Books  |year=1983  |chapter=Snakes and Ladders  |pages=134\u201335  |isbn=0-671-06030-9}}</ref>  The ladders represented virtues such as generosity, faith, and humility, while the snakes represented vices such as lust, anger, murder, and theft.  The morality lesson of the game was that a person can attain salvation ([[Moksha]]) through doing good, whereas by doing evil one will inherit [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] to lower forms of life. The number of ladders was less than the number of snakes as a reminder that a path of good is much more difficult to tread than a path of sins. Presumably, reaching the last square (number 100) represented the attainment of ''Moksha'' (spiritual liberation).\n\nWhen the game was brought to England, the Indian virtues and vices were replaced by English ones in hopes of better reflecting Victorian doctrines of morality. Squares of Fulfillment, Grace and Success were accessible by ladders of Thrift, Penitence and Industry and snakes of Indulgence, Disobedience and Indolence caused one to end up in Illness, Disgrace and Poverty. While the Indian version of the game had snakes outnumbering ladders, the English counterpart was more forgiving as it contained each in the same amount.<ref name=\"changes\">Masters, James. \"Moksha-Patamu (Snakes and Ladders).\" The Online Guide to Traditional Games. N.p., n.d. Web.</ref> This concept of equality signifies the cultural ideal that for every sin one commits, there exists another chance at redemption.\n\nThe association of Britain's Snakes and Ladders with India and gyan chauper began with the returning of colonial families from one of Britain's most important imperial possessions, India. The d\u00e9cor and art of the early English boards of the 20th century reflect this relationship. By the 1940s, very few pictorial references to the Indian culture were found due to the economic demands of the war and the collapse of British rule in India.<ref name=\"topsfield\"/> Although the game's sense of morality has lasted through the game's generations, the physical allusions to religious and philosophical thought in the game as presented in Indian models appear to have all but faded. There has even been evidence of a possible Buddhist version of the game existing in India during the Pala-Sena time period.\n\nIn [[Andhra Pradesh]], this game is popularly called ''Vaikunthapali'' or ''Paramapada Sopana Patam'' (the ladder to salvation)  in Telugu.<ref name=Augustyn>Augustyn (2004), pp. 27\u201328</ref><ref name=\"topsfield\">{{cite book|last=Topsfield|first=Andrew|year=2006|title=The art of play.

In [[Tamil Nadu]] the game is called ''Parama padam'' and is often played by devotees of [[Hindu]]  god [[Vishnu]] during the [[Vaikuntha Ekadashi]] festival in order to stay awake during the night.\n\nIn the original game the squares of virtue are: ''Faith'' (12), ''Reliability'' (51), ''Generosity'' (57), ''Knowledge'' (76), and ''Asceticism'' (78).  The squares of vice or evil are: ''Disobedience'' (41), ''Vanity'' (44), ''Vulgarity'' (49), ''Theft'' (52), ''Lying'' (58), ''Drunkenness'' (62), ''Debt'' (69), ''Murder'' (73), ''Rage'' (84), ''Greed'' (92), ''Pride'' (95), and ''Lust'' (99).<ref name=\"BBB\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Cnl03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Milton Bradley ''Chutes and Ladders'' gameboard {{circa|1952}}. The illustrations show good deeds and their rewards; bad deeds and their consequences.]]\n\nEach player starts with a token on the starting square (usually the \"1\" grid square in the bottom left corner, or simply, off the board next to the \"1\" grid square). Players take turns rolling a single [[Dice|die]] to move their token by the number of squares indicated by the die roll. Tokens follow a fixed route marked on the gameboard which usually follows a [[boustrophedon]] (ox-plow) track from the bottom to the top of the playing area, passing once through every square. If, on completion of a move, a player's token lands on the lower-numbered end of a \"ladder\", the player moves the token up to the ladder's higher-numbered square. If the player lands on the higher-numbered square of a \"snake\" (or chute), the token must be moved down to the snake's lower-numbered square.\n\nIf a player rolls a ''6'', the player may, after moving, immediately take another turn; otherwise play passes to the next player in turn. The player who is first to bring their token to the last square of the track is the winner.\n\n===Variations===\nVariants exists where a player must roll the exact number to reach the final square. Depending on the variation, if the die roll is too large, the token either remains in place or goes off the final square and back again. (For example, if a player requiring a ''3'' to win rolls a ''5'', the token moves forward three spaces, then back two spaces.) In certain circumstances (such as a player rolling a ''6'' when a ''1'' is required to win), a player can end up further away from the final square after their move, than before it.\n\nIn the book ''[[Winning Ways]]'' the authors propose a variant which they call ''Adders-and-Ladders'' and which, unlike the original game, involves skill. Instead of tokens for each player, there is a store of indistinguishable tokens shared by all players. The illustration has five tokens (and a five by five board). There is no die to roll; instead, the player chooses any token and moves it one to four spaces. Whoever moves the last token to the Home space (i.e. the last number) wins.<ref>https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/951182/rules-adders-ladders</ref>\n\n==Specific editions==\nThe most widely known edition of Snakes and Ladders in the United States is ''Chutes and Ladders'' released by [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]] in 1943.<ref name=\"slesin\">Slesin, Suzanne.

The theme of the board design is [[playground]] equipment, showing children climbing ladders and descending chutes.\n\nThe artwork on the board teaches [[morality]] lessons: squares on the bottom of the ladders show a child doing a good or sensible deed, at the top of the ladder there is an image of the child enjoying the reward; squares at the top of the chutes show children engaging in mischievous or foolish behavior, on the bottom of the chute the image shows the children suffering the consequences.\n\nBlack children were depicted in the Milton Bradley game for the first time in 1974.<ref name=\"slesin\" /> There have been many pop culture versions of the game, with graphics featuring such children's television characters as ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]''.

{"title_page": "Microfluidics", "text_new": "{{short description|Interdisciplinary science}}\n'''Microfluidics''' refers to the behaviour, precise control, and manipulation of [[fluids]] that are geometrically constrained to a small scale (typically sub-millimeter) at which capillary penetration governs mass transport. It is a multidisciplinary field that involves [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[nanotechnology]], and [[biotechnology]]. It has practical applications in the design of systems that process low volumes of fluids to achieve [[multiplexing]], automation, and [[high-throughput screening]]. Microfluidics emerged in the beginning of the 1980s and is used in the development of [[inkjet]] printheads, [[DNA chip]]s, [[lab-on-a-chip]] technology, micro-propulsion, and micro-thermal technologies.\n\nTypically, micro means one of the following features:\n\n* Small volumes (\u03bcL, nL, pL, fL)\n* Small size\n* Low energy consumption\n* Microdomain effects\n\nTypically microfluidic systems transport, mix, separate, or otherwise process fluids. Various applications rely on passive fluid control using [[capillary force]]s, in the form of capillary flow modifying elements, akin to flow resistors and flow accelerators. In some applications, external actuation means are additionally used for a directed transport of the media. Examples are rotary drives applying centrifugal forces for the fluid transport on the passive chips. '''Active microfluidics''' refers to the defined manipulation of the working fluid by active (micro) components such as [[micropump]]s or [[microvalve]]s. Micropumps supply fluids in a continuous manner or are used for dosing. Microvalves determine the flow direction or the mode of movement of pumped liquids. Often, processes normally carried out in a lab are miniaturised on a single chip, which enhances efficiency and mobility, and reduces sample and reagent volumes.\n\n==Microscale behaviour of fluids==\n[[File:Microfluidics.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Silicone rubber and glass microfluidic devices. Top: a photograph of the devices. Bottom: [[Phase contrast]] [[micrograph]]s of a serpentine channel ~15 [[\u03bcm]] wide.]]\nThe behaviour of fluids at the microscale can differ from \"macrofluidic\" behaviour in that factors such as [[surface tension]], energy dissipation, and fluidic resistance start to dominate the system. Microfluidics studies how these behaviours change, and how they can be worked around, or exploited for new uses.<ref>S.C.Terry, J.H.Jerman and J.B.Angell:A Gas Chromatographic Air Analyzer Fabricated on a Silicon Wafer, IEEE Trans.Electron Devices, ED-26,12(1979)1880-1886.</ref><ref name=Kirby>{{cite book | author=Kirby, B.J. | title=Micro- and Nanoscale Fluid Mechanics: Transport in Microfluidic Devices | url=http://www.kirbyresearch.com/textbook | year=2010 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref><ref name=Karniadakis>{{cite book | author1=Karniadakis, G.M. | author2=Beskok, A. | author3=Aluru, N. | title=Microflows and Nanoflows | year=2005 | publisher =[[Springer Verlag]] }}</ref><ref name=Bruus>{{cite book | author=Bruus, H. | title=Theoretical Microfluidics | year=2007 | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Microfluidics|last=Shkolnikov|first=V|year=2019|isbn=978-1790217281|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAt small scales (channel size of around 100 [[nanometers]] to 500 [[micrometers]]) some interesting and sometimes unintuitive properties appear. In particular, the [[Reynolds number]] (which compares the effect of the momentum of a fluid to the effect of [[viscosity]]) can become very low. A key consequence is co-flowing fluids do not necessarily mix in the traditional sense, as flow becomes [[laminar flow|laminar]] rather than [[turbulent flow|turbulent]]; molecular transport between them must often be through [[diffusion]].<ref name=Tabeling>{{cite book | author=Tabeling, P. | title=Introduction to Microfluidics | url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontomi0000tabe | url-access=registration | year=2005 | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] }}</ref>\n\nHigh specificity of chemical and physical properties (concentration, pH, temperature, shear force, etc.) can also be ensured resulting in more uniform reaction conditions and higher grade products in single and multi-step reactions.<ref name=\"microreactors\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chokkalingam | first1 = V. | last2 = Weidenhof | first2 = B. | last3 = Kraemer | first3 = M. | last4 = Maier | first4 = W.

Continuous-flow devices are adequate for many well-defined and simple biochemical applications, and for certain tasks such as chemical separation, but they are less suitable for tasks requiring a high degree of flexibility or fluid manipulations. These closed-channel systems are inherently difficult to integrate and scale because the parameters that govern flow field vary along the flow path making the fluid flow at any one location dependent on the properties of the entire system. Permanently etched microstructures also lead to limited reconfigurability and poor fault tolerance capability.

Therefore, digital microfluidics offers a flexible and scalable system architecture as well as high [[fault-tolerance]] capability. Moreover, because each droplet can be controlled independently, these systems also have dynamic reconfigurability, whereby groups of unit cells in a microfluidic array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays.

This technology focuses acoustic energy into a fluid sample to eject droplets as small as a millionth of a millionth of a litre (picoliter = 10<sup>\u221212</sup> litre). ADE technology is a very gentle process, and it can be used to transfer proteins, high molecular weight DNA and live cells without damage or loss of viability.

It is a multidisciplinary field that involves [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[nanotechnology]], and [[biotechnology]]. It has practical applications in the design of systems that process low volumes of fluids to achieve [[multiplexing]], automation, and [[high-throughput screening]]. Microfluidics emerged in the beginning of the 1980s and is used in the development of [[inkjet]] printheads, [[DNA chip]]s, [[lab-on-a-chip]] technology, micro-propulsion, and micro-thermal technologies.\n\nTypically, micro means one of the following features:\n\n* Small volumes (\u03bcL, nL, pL, fL)\n* Small size\n* Low energy consumption\n* Microdomain effects\n\nTypically microfluidic systems transport, mix, separate, or otherwise process fluids. Various applications rely on passive fluid control using [[capillary force]]s, in the form of capillary flow modifying elements, akin to flow resistors and flow accelerators. In some applications, external actuation means are additionally used for a directed transport of the media. Examples are rotary drives applying centrifugal forces for the fluid transport on the passive chips. '''Active microfluidics''' refers to the defined manipulation of the working fluid by active (micro) components such as [[micropump]]s or [[microvalve]]s. Micropumps supply fluids in a continuous manner or are used for dosing. Microvalves determine the flow direction or the mode of movement of pumped liquids. Often, processes normally carried out in a lab are miniaturised on a single chip, which enhances efficiency and mobility, and reduces sample and reagent volumes.\n\n==Microscale behaviour of fluids==\n[[File:Microfluidics.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Silicone rubber and glass microfluidic devices.

In particular, the [[Reynolds number]] (which compares the effect of the momentum of a fluid to the effect of [[viscosity]]) can become very low. A key consequence is co-flowing fluids do not necessarily mix in the traditional sense, as flow becomes [[laminar flow|laminar]] rather than [[turbulent flow|turbulent]]; molecular transport between them must often be through [[diffusion]].<ref name=Tabeling>{{cite book | author=Tabeling, P. | title=Introduction to Microfluidics | url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontomi0000tabe | url-access=registration | year=2005 | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] }}</ref>\n\nHigh specificity of chemical and physical properties (concentration, pH, temperature, shear force, etc.) can also be ensured resulting in more uniform reaction conditions and higher grade products in single and multi-step reactions.<ref name=\"microreactors\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chokkalingam | first1 = V. | last2 = Weidenhof | first2 = B. | last3 = Kraemer | first3 = M. | last4 = Maier | first4 = W.

Continuous-flow devices are adequate for many well-defined and simple biochemical applications, and for certain tasks such as chemical separation, but they are less suitable for tasks requiring a high degree of flexibility or fluid manipulations. These closed-channel systems are inherently difficult to integrate and scale because the parameters that govern flow field vary along the flow path making the fluid flow at any one location dependent on the properties of the entire system. Permanently etched microstructures also lead to limited reconfigurability and poor fault tolerance capability. Computer-aided design automation approaches for continuous-flow microfluidics have been proposed in recent years to alleviate the design effort and to solve the scalability problems.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1109/TCAD.2017.2760628|title = Columba 2.0: A Co-Layout Synthesis Tool for Continuous-Flow Microfluidic Biochips|year = 2018|last1 = Tseng|first1 = Tsun-Ming|last2 = Li|first2 = Mengchu|last3 = Freitas|first3 = Daniel Nestor|last4 = McAuley|first4 = Travis|last5 = Li|first5 = Bing|last6 = Ho|first6 = Tsung-Yi|last7 = Araci|first7 = Ismail Emre|last8 = Schlichtmann|first8 = Ulf|journal = IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems|volume = 37|issue = 8|pages = 1588\u20131601}}</ref>\n\nProcess monitoring capabilities in continuous-flow systems can be achieved with highly sensitive microfluidic flow sensors based on [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] technology, which offers resolutions down to the nanoliter range.\n\n===Droplet-based microfluidics===\n\n[[File: Gas4psi LONDs26uLmin-1 50kfps x10lens.webm|thumb|High frame rate video showing microbubble pinch-off formation in a flow-focusing microfluidic device <ref name=DOI153>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5518/153|year = 2018|last1 = Churchman|first1 = Adam H.|title = Data associated with 'Combined flow-focus and self-assembly routes for the formation of lipid stabilized oil-shelled microbubbles'|publisher = University of Leeds}}</ref>]]\n\n{{Main|Droplet-based microfluidics}}\nDroplet-based microfluidics is a subcategory of microfluidics in contrast with continuous microfluidics; droplet-based microfluidics manipulates discrete volumes of fluids in immiscible phases with low Reynolds number and laminar flow regimes.

This \"digitisation\" method facilitates the use of a hierarchical and cell-based approach for microfluidic biochip design. Therefore, digital microfluidics offers a flexible and scalable system architecture as well as high [[fault-tolerance]] capability. Moreover, because each droplet can be controlled independently, these systems also have dynamic reconfigurability, whereby groups of unit cells in a microfluidic array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. Although droplets are manipulated in confined microfluidic channels, since the control on droplets is not independent, it should not be confused as \"digital microfluidics\". One common actuation method for digital microfluidics is [[electrowetting]]-on-dielectric ([[EWOD]]). Many lab-on-a-chip applications have been demonstrated within the digital microfluidics paradigm using electrowetting.

The rivalry between these two schools dates to their first men's [[college football]] game in 1966, and has continued across all sports, with the [[college basketball|basketball]] series gaining attention as well, having started in 1968. The schools have also shared conferences historically, with the rivalry stretching over the span of five conferences from the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], to the [[Metro Conference]], [[Great Midwest Conference]], [[Conference USA]], and more recently in the [[American Athletic Conference]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.downthedrive.com/2019/12/4/20993794/history-of-cincinnati-vs-memphis-football-series|title=History of Cincinnati vs Memphis Football Series|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=December 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://memphis.rivals.com/news/a-look-back-at-the-history-of-the-rivalry-between-the-tigers-and-bearcats?yptr=yahoo?src=rss|title=A look back at the history of the rivalry between the Tigers and Bearcats|publisher=Rivals.com|accessdate=December 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/sports/college/memphis-tigers/basketball/2019/02/06/penny-hardaway-nick-van-exel-break-down-memphis-cincinnati-rivalry/2766313002/|author=Drew Hill|title=Penny Hardaway, Nick Van Exel reminisce about Memphis vs. Cincinnati rivalry on the golf course|publisher=Memphis Commercial Appeal|accessdate=December 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:88%;\"\n|+ College Comparison\n! \n! style=\"{{NCAA color cell|Cincinnati Bearcats}}\" | [[University of Cincinnati|{{white|Cincinnati}}]]\n! style=\"{{NCAA color cell|Memphis Tigers}}\" | [[University of Memphis|{{white|Memphis}}]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Founded\n| align=center | 1819 || align=center | 1912\n|-\n! scope=row | Type \n| align=center | [[Public university|Public]] || align=center |[[Public university|Public]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Location\n| align=center | [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, OH]] || align=center | [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis, TN]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Students \n| align=center | 44,338 || align=center | 21,521\n|-\n! scope=row | School colors \n| align=center | {{color box|#E00122}} {{color box|Black}} || align=center | {{color box|#0D3182}} {{color box|#888C8F}}\n|-\n! scope=row | Nickname \n| align=center | [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Bearcats]] || align=center | [[Memphis Tigers|Tigers]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Stadium\n| align=center | [[Nippert Stadium]] || align=center | [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium|Liberty Bowl]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Arena\n| align=center | [[Fifth Third Arena]] || align=center | [[FedExForum]]\n|}\nBoth universities share histories in their founding as small city universities into large universities with prominent Division 1 athletic programs. The schools would first face off as members of the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] in the 1960s and then both schools would be founding members of the [[Metro Conference]], [[Great Midwest Conference]], and [[Conference USA]]. The schools were reunited as conference rivals due to the [[2010\u20132014 NCAA conference realignment]] as members of the [[American Athletic Conference]]. While the rivalry was represented annually in football, the true intensity of the rivalry was felt more deeply on the basketball court.\n\nSince the founding of the American, the schools have had many notable contests in various sports. Most recently, with the football teams facing off in the [[2019 American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game]], with Memphis claiming the victory.\n\n==Football==\n{{See also|Cincinnati Bearcats football|Memphis Tigers football}}\n{{Infobox sports rivalry\n| wide                  = yes\n| name                  = Cincinnati\u2013Memphis football rivalry\n| image                 = \n| image_size            = \n| caption               = \n| team1                 = [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati Bearcats]]\n| team1logo             = Cincinnati University Bearcats textlogo.svg\n| team2                 = [[Memphis Tigers football|Memphis Tigers]]\n| team2logo             = Memphis Tigers wordmark.svg\n| sport                 = [[College Football]]\n| firstmeeting          = November 19, 1966<br /> Cincinnati 14 \u2013 Memphis 26\n| mostrecent            = December 7, 2019<br />No. 20 Cincinnati 24 \u2013 No. 17 Memphis 29\n| nextmeeting           = October 31, 2020\n| total                 = 36\n| series                = Memphis leads, 23\u201313\n| largestvictory        = \n| longeststreak         = Memphis, 8 (1966\u201374)\n| longestunbeatenstreak = \n| currentstreak         = Memphis, 5 (2014\u2013present)\n| currentunbeatenstreak = \n| trophy                = \n| trophy series         = \n| stadiums              =  \n}}\n\n===Notable Games===\n'''Nov 24, 2001''': Memphis was searching for their first winning season since 1994 and the story looked complete when the Tigers scored a touchdown with 2:16 left in the 4th quarter.

The bulk of the material was written by Johansen and guitarist [[Johnny Thunders]]. The Dolls were well received critically, but did not succeed commercially.\n\nIn 1975, Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan left the band. Johansen and [[Sylvain Sylvain]], along with Peter Jordan, Chris Robison, and Tony Machine, continued playing as the New York Dolls until 1976, after which Johansen embarked on a solo career.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> His first two albums, ''David Johansen'' and ''In Style'', featured several enduring originals.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Sylvain Sylvain frequently performed with him, and his band covered many Dolls songs in concert; his live albums ''Live It Up'' and ''The David Johansen Group Live'' document Johansen's reputation as an exceptional concert performer. The studio releases ''Here Comes the Night'' (which includes a signature number, \"Heart of Gold\") and ''Sweet Revenge'' again showcased his strengths as a writer of new material and featured a guest appearance by jazz saxophone player [[Big Jay McNeely]]. A number of the songs on ''Here Comes the Night'' were co-written with South African musician [[Blondie Chaplin]]. In 1982 Johansen was the opening act for [[The Who]] at several U.S. East Coast concerts, Shea Stadium Queensborough and [[Capital Centre (Landover, Maryland)|Capital Centre]].\n\n===Buster Poindexter===\nIn the late 1980s, Johansen achieved moderate commercial success under the pseudonym Buster Poindexter,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> accompanied by The Uptown Horns, performing a mixture of [[jazz]], [[lounge music|lounge]], [[Calypso music|calypso]], and novelty songs, and appearing as part of the [[house band]] on the television program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. As Poindexter, he scored his first [[Record chart#Chart hit|hit]] song, \"[[Hot Hot Hot (Arrow song)#Buster Poindexter version|Hot Hot Hot]],\" which, in an interview on [[NPR|National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Fresh Air]]'', he called \"the bane of my existence,\" due to its pervasive popularity. \"Hot Hot Hot\" was initially written and recorded by [[Montserrat]]ian [[Soca music|Soca]] artist [[Arrow (musician)|Arrow]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> As Poindexter, Johansen often appeared with his band, The Banshees of Blue. Early Poindexter releases combined an eclectic selection of covers with Johansen's own compositions. Johansen went on to issue ''Buster Poindexter's Happy Hour'', an album of songs thematically linked by their subject matter: alcohol. It is his most jazz-influenced release to date. It was followed by ''Buster Poindexter's Spanish Rocket Ship'', a synthesis of [[rhythm and blues]], calypso and Latin jazz.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n==Acting==\nJohansen's legs appeared in [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]'s 1971 film ''[[Up Your Legs Forever]]''.<ref name=\"Cott2013\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Cott|title=Days That I'll Remember: Spending Time With John Lennon & Yoko Ono|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ei8DAwAAQBAJ|date=16 July 2013|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-78323-048-8|page=74}}</ref>\n\nJohansen acted in several films during the 1980s and 1990s, and in 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0423774/|title=David Johansen|website=IMDb}}</ref> had a brief role on the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''.

Owing to the success of the tour, in 2006 the New York Dolls released ''One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This'', their first album in nearly thirty years. It was critic [[Robert Christgau]]'s choice for album of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/deans06.php |title=2006: Dean's List |publisher=Robert Christgau |date=February 14, 2007 |access-date=2013-06-15}}</ref> In 2009 the band released ''[[Cause I Sez So]]'' and in 2011 ''[[Dancing Backward in High Heels]]''.\n\nJohansen hosts a weekly show, ''David Johansen's Mansion of Fun'', on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] while continuing to write and perform.

The 2006 Dolls CD ''Private World : The Complete Early Studio Demos 1972/3'' featured the Dolls performing songs by [[Otis Redding]], [[Gary U.S. Bonds]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[The Shangri-Las]], and [[Muddy Waters]], in addition to versions of songs from their two Mercury albums.

The bulk of the material was written by Johansen and guitarist [[Johnny Thunders]]. The Dolls were well received critically, but did not succeed commercially.\n\nIn 1975, Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan left the band. Johansen and [[Sylvain Sylvain]], along with Peter Jordan, Chris Robison, and Tony Machine, continued playing as the New York Dolls until 1976, after which Johansen embarked on a solo career.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> His first two albums, ''David Johansen'' and ''In Style'', featured several enduring originals.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Sylvain Sylvain frequently performed with him, and his band covered many Dolls songs in concert; his live albums ''Live It Up'' and ''The David Johansen Group Live'' document Johansen's reputation as an exceptional concert performer. The studio releases ''Here Comes the Night'' (which includes a signature number, \"Heart of Gold\") and ''Sweet Revenge'' again showcased his strengths as a writer of new material and featured a guest appearance by jazz saxophone player [[Big Jay McNeely]]. A number of the songs on ''Here Comes the Night'' were co-written with South African musician [[Blondie Chaplin]]. In 1982 Johansen was the opening act for [[The Who]] at several U.S. East Coast concerts, Shea Stadium Queensborough and [[Capital Centre (Landover, Maryland)|Capital Centre]].\n\n===Buster Poindexter===\nIn the late 1980s, Johansen achieved moderate commercial success under the pseudonym Buster Poindexter,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> accompanied by The Uptown Horns, performing a mixture of [[jazz]], [[lounge music|lounge]], [[Calypso music|calypso]], and novelty songs, and appearing as part of the [[house band]] on the television program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. As Poindexter, he scored his first [[Record chart#Chart hit|hit]] song, \"[[Hot Hot Hot (Arrow song)#Buster Poindexter version|Hot Hot Hot]],\" which, in an interview on [[NPR|National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Fresh Air]]'', he called \"the bane of my existence,\" due to its pervasive popularity. \"Hot Hot Hot\" was initially written and recorded by [[Montserrat]]ian [[Soca music|Soca]] artist [[Arrow (musician)|Arrow]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> As Poindexter, Johansen often appeared with his band, The Banshees of Blue. Early Poindexter releases combined an eclectic selection of covers with Johansen's own compositions. Johansen went on to issue ''Buster Poindexter's Happy Hour'', an album of songs thematically linked by their subject matter: alcohol. It is his most jazz-influenced release to date. It was followed by ''Buster Poindexter's Spanish Rocket Ship'', a synthesis of [[rhythm and blues]], calypso and Latin jazz.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n==Acting==\nJohansen's legs appeared in [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]'s 1971 film ''[[Up Your Legs Forever]]''.<ref name=\"Cott2013\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Cott|title=Days That I'll Remember: Spending Time With John Lennon & Yoko Ono|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ei8DAwAAQBAJ|date=16 July 2013|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-78323-048-8|page=74}}</ref>\n\nJohansen acted in several films during the 1980s and 1990s, and in 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0423774/|title=David Johansen|website=IMDb}}</ref> had a brief role on the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''.

Toledo was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1986 for its extensive monumental and cultural heritage.\n\nToledo is known as the \"Imperial City\" because it was the main venue of the court of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] in Spain, and as the \"City of the Three Cultures\" for the cultural influences of Christians, Muslims, and Jews reflected in its history. It was the capital from 542 to 725 AD of the ancient [[Visigothic kingdom]], which followed the fall of the Roman Empire, and the location of historic events such as the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Councils of Toledo]]. The city has a grand Gothic Cathedral, the ''Catedral Primada de Espa\u00f1a'' (The Primate Cathedral of Spain), and a long history in the production of [[bladed weapon]]s, which are now common souvenirs of the city.\n\nPeople who were born or have lived in Toledo include [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]], [[Ab\u016b Ish\u0101q Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b|Al-Zarqali]], [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]], [[Eleanor of Toledo]], [[Alfonso X]], [[Isaac Israeli ben Joseph|Israeli ben Joseph]], [[Judah Halevi|Halevi]], and [[El Greco]]. {{As of|2015}}, the city had a population of 83,226<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Datos.htm?t=2902\n| title = Tabla2902\n| website = www.ine.es\n| access-date = 2016-03-01\n}}</ref> and an area of {{convert|232.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Coat of arms==\n{{Main article|Coat of arms of Toledo (Spain)}}\nThe town was granted arms in the 16th century, which by special royal privilege was based on the [[coat of arms of Spain|royal of arms of Spain]].\n\n==History==\n{{overly detailed|date=July 2018}}\n{{main|History of Toledo, Spain|Timeline of Toledo, Spain}}\n\n===Antiquity===\n[[File:Puente de Alc\u00e1ntara, Toledo, Castilla-La Mancha, Espa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|Roman bridge [[Puente de Alc\u00e1ntara]]]]\n[[File:Cueva de H\u00e9rcules - 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman [[Cave of Hercules]], part of the sight [[Subterranean Toledo]]]]\nToledo (<small>Latin:</small> ''Toletum'') is mentioned by the Roman historian Livy (ca. 59 BC \u2013 17 AD) as ''urbs parva, sed loco munita'' (\"a small city, but fortified by location\").

The decision also took king-making power away from the bishops, who would be in their own sees and would not have time to come together to attend the royal election. The decision did allow the bishop of Toledo, alone among bishops, to be involved in decisions concerning the royal Visigothic succession.

Wamba weakened the power of the bishop of Toledo by creating a new bishopric outside Toledo at the church of Saints Peter and Paul. This was one of the main churches of Toledo and was the church where Wamba was anointed king, and the church from which Visigothic kings departed for war after special ceremonies in which they were presented with a relic of the [[True Cross]]. By creating a new bishopric there, Wamba removed power over royal succession from the bishop of Toledo and granted it to the new bishop.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|page=100}}</ref> The [[Twelfth Council of Toledo]] was held in 681 after Wamba's removal from office. Convinced that he was dying, Wamba had accepted a state of [[penitence]] that according to the decision of a previous church council, made him ineligible to remain king. The Twelfth Council, led by newly installed bishop [[Julian of Toledo|Julian]] confirmed the validity of Wamba's removal from office and his succession by [[Erwig|Ervig]]. The Twelfth Council eliminated the new bishopric that Wamba had created and returned the powers over succession to the bishop of Toledo.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|page=101}}</ref>\n\nThe Twelfth Council of Toledo approved 28 laws against the Jews.

After the fall of the caliphate, Toledo was the capital city of one of the richest [[Taifa]]s of [[Al-Andalus]]. Its population was overwhelmingly [[Muladi]], and, because of its central location in the Iberian Peninsula, Toledo took a central position in the struggles between the Muslim and Christian rulers of northern Spain. The conquest of Toledo by [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI of Castile]] in 1085 marked the first time a major city in Al-Andalus was captured by Christian forces; it served to sharpen the religious aspect of the Christian reconquest.\n\n===Medieval Toledo after the Reconquista===\n[[File:Braun Toledo UBHD.jpg|thumb|230px|Toledo in the 16th century]]\n[[File:El Greco - View and Plan of Toledo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''[[View of Toledo]]'' by city resident [[El Greco]] c. 1608.]]\nOn May 25, 1085, Alfonso VI of Castile took Toledo and established direct personal control over the Moorish city from which he had been exacting tribute, ending the medieval [[Taifa]]'s [[Kingdom of Toledo]]. This was the first concrete step taken by the combined kingdom of Leon-Castile in the [[Reconquista]] by Christian forces. After Castilian conquest, Toledo continued to be a major cultural centre; its Arab libraries were not pillaged, and a tag-team [[Toledo School of Translators|translation centre]] was established in which books in Arabic or Hebrew would be translated into Castilian by Muslim and Jewish scholars, and from Castilian into Latin by Castilian scholars, thus letting long-lost knowledge spread through Christian Europe again. Toledo served as the capital city of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] intermittently (Castile did not have a permanent capital) from 1085, and the city flourished. Under the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo]] multiple persecutions (633, 653, 693) and stake burnings of Jews (638 CE) occurred; the [[Kingdom of Toledo]] followed up on this tradition (1368, 1391, 1449, 1486\u20131490 CE) including forced conversions and mass murder and the rioting and blood bath against the Jews of Toledo (1212 CE).<ref name=STR-JewishPersecution>{{cite web|last1=Grosser|first1=P.E. and E.G.

It was at this time that Don [[Isaac Abrabanel]], a prominent Jewish figure in Spain in the 15th century and one of the king's trusted courtiers who witnessed the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, wrote that Toledo was named ''\u1e6culay\u1e6dulah'' by its first Jewish inhabitants who, he stated, settled there in the 5th century BCE, and which name \u2013 by way of conjecture \u2013 may have been related to its Hebrew cognate \u05d8\u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05dc (= wandering), on account of their wandering from Jerusalem.

However, in 1561, in the first years of his son [[Philip II of Spain]]'s reign, the Spanish court was moved to [[Valladolid]], thus letting the city's importance dwindle until the late 20th century, when it became the capital of the autonomous community of [[Castile\u2013La Mancha]].

Between the 15th and 17th centuries the Toledo sword-making industry enjoyed a great boom, to the point where its [[Toledo steel|products]] came to be regarded as the best in Europe. Swords and daggers were made by individual craftsmen, although the sword-makers guild oversaw their quality. In the late 17th and early 18th century production began to decline, prompting the creation of the Royal Arms Factory in 1761 by order of [[King Carlos III]]. The Royal Factory brought together all the sword-makers guilds of the city and it was located in the former mint. In 1777, recognizing the need to expand the space, Carlos III commissioned the architect [[Francesco Sabatini|Sabatini]] to construct a new building on the outskirts of the city. This was the beginning of several phases of expansion. Its importance was such that it eventually developed into a city within the city of Toledo.\n\nIn the 20th century, the production of knives and swords for the army was reduced to cavalry weapons only, and after the [[Spanish Civil War]], to the supply of swords to the officers and NCOs of the various military units.

The 2011 election saw a pact made between the 11 members of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) and the 2 members of the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], to retain the position of the PSOE's Emiliano Garc\u00eda-Page S\u00e1nchez as mayor, which he has been since 2007.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:G\u00e1rgola drag\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|upright|A gargoyle of the [[Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes]]]]\n[[File:Sinagoga Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Synagogue of Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca]]]]\n[[File:Torah ark - Sinagoga de Transito - Toledo.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Synagogue of El Transito]] next to the [[Sephardic Museum]]]]\nThe old city is located on a mountaintop with a 150-degree view, surrounded on three sides by a bend in the [[Tagus|Tagus River]], and contains many historical sites, including the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Toledo|Alc\u00e1zar]], the cathedral (the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] church of Spain), and the Zocodover, a central market place.\n\nFrom the 4th century to the 16th century about thirty [[synod]]s were held at Toledo. The earliest, directed against [[Priscillian]], assembled in 400. At the synod of 589 the Visigothic King [[Reccared I|Reccared]] declared his conversion from [[Arianism]] to [[Catholicism]]; the synod of 633 decreed uniformity of catholic liturgy throughout the Visigothic kingdom and took stringent measures against baptized Jews who had relapsed into their former faith. Other councils forbade circumcision, Jewish rites and observance of the Sabbath and festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font.<ref>S. Katz, ''The Jews in the Visigothic Kingdoms of Spain and Gaul'', (Cambridge 1937). Cited in [[Paul Johnson (writer)]], ''A History of the Jews'', p. 177</ref> The council of 681 assured to the [[Archdiocese of Toledo|archbishop of Toledo]] the [[primate (bishop)|primacy]] of Spain. At [[Guadamur]], very close to Toledo, was dug in 1858 the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]], the best example of [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic art]] in Spain.\n\nAs nearly one hundred early canons of Toledo found a place in the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', they exerted an important influence on the development of [[Canon law|ecclesiastical law]]. The synod of 1565\u20131566 concerned itself with the execution of the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]; and the last council held at Toledo, 1582\u20131583, was guided in detail by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].\n\nToledo had large communities of Muslims and Jews until they were [[Alhambra Decree|expelled from Spain in 1492]] (Jews) and 1502 ([[Mud\u00e9jar]]s). Today's city contains the religious monuments the [[Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca|Synagogue of Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca]], the [[Synagogue of El Transito]], [[Mosque of Cristo de la Luz]] and the [[Church of San Sebasti\u00e1n, Toledo|church of San Sebasti\u00e1n]] dating from before the expulsion, still maintained in good condition. Among [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]-speaking [[Sephardi Jews]], in their various diasporas, the [[family name]] [[Toledano]] is still prevalent \u2013 indicating an ancestry traced back to this city (the name is also attested among non-Jews in various [[Spanish language|Spanish-speaking countries]]).\n\nIn the 13th century, Toledo was a major cultural centre under the guidance of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]], called \"El Sabio\" (\"the Wise\") for his love of learning. The [[Toledo School of Translators]], that had commenced under Archbishop [[Raymond de Sauvet\u00e2t|Raymond of Toledo]], continued to bring vast stores of knowledge to Europe by rendering great academic and philosophical works in Arabic into Latin. The [[Palacio de Galiana]], built in the [[Mud\u00e9jar]] style, is one of the monuments that remain from that period.\n\nThe [[Cathedral of Toledo]] (''Catedral de Toledo'') was built between 1226 and 1493 and modeled after the [[Bourges Cathedral]], though it also combines some characteristics of the [[Mud\u00e9jar]] style. It is remarkable for its incorporation of light and features the [[Baroque]] altar called ''[[El Transparente]]'', several stories high, with fantastic figures of stucco, paintings, bronze castings, and multiple colors of marble, a masterpiece of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[mixed media]] by [[Narciso Tom\u00e9]] topped by the daily effect for just a few minutes of a shaft of light from which this feature of the cathedral derives its name. Two notable bridges secured access to Toledo across the Tajo, the [[Puente de Alc\u00e1ntara, Toledo|Alc\u00e1ntara bridge]] and the later built [[Puente de San Mart\u00edn (Toledo)|San Mart\u00edn bridge]].\n\nThe [[Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes, Toledo|Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes]] is a [[Franciscan]] [[monastery]], built 1477\u20131504, in a remarkable combination of Gothic-Spanish-Flemish style with [[Mud\u00e9jar]] ornamentation.\n\nToledo was home to [[El Greco]] for the latter part of his life, and is the subject of some of his most famous paintings, including ''[[The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]]'', exhibited in the Church of Santo Tom\u00e9.\n\nWhen Philip II moved the [[royal court]] from Toledo to [[Madrid]] in 1561, the old city went into a slow decline from which it never recovered.\n\n===Toledo steel===\n{{Main|Toledo steel}}\nToledo has been a traditional sword-making, steel-working centre since about 500 BC, and came to the attention of Rome when used by [[Hannibal]] in the [[Punic Wars]].

Toledo was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1986 for its extensive monumental and cultural heritage.\n\nToledo is known as the \"Imperial City\" because it was the main venue of the court of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] in Spain, and as the \"City of the Three Cultures\" for the cultural influences of Christians, Muslims, and Jews reflected in its history. It was the capital from 542 to 725 AD of the ancient [[Visigothic kingdom]], which followed the fall of the Roman Empire, and the location of historic events such as the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Councils of Toledo]]. The city has a grand Gothic Cathedral, the ''Catedral Primada de Espa\u00f1a'' (The Primate Cathedral of Spain), and a long history in the production of [[bladed weapon]]s, which are now common souvenirs of the city.\n\nPeople who were born or have lived in Toledo include [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]], [[Ab\u016b Ish\u0101q Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b|Al-Zarqali]], [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]], [[Eleanor of Toledo]], [[Alfonso X]], [[Isaac Israeli ben Joseph|Israeli ben Joseph]], [[Judah Halevi|Halevi]], and [[El Greco]]. {{As of|2015}}, the city had a population of 83,226<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Datos.htm?t=2902\n| title = Tabla2902\n| website = www.ine.es\n| access-date = 2016-03-01\n}}</ref> and an area of {{convert|232.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Coat of arms==\n{{Main article|Coat of arms of Toledo (Spain)}}\nThe town was granted arms in the 16th century, which by special royal privilege was based on the [[coat of arms of Spain|royal of arms of Spain]].\n\n==History==\n{{overly detailed|date=July 2018}}\n{{main|History of Toledo, Spain|Timeline of Toledo, Spain}}\n\n===Antiquity===\n[[File:Puente de Alc\u00e1ntara, Toledo, Castilla-La Mancha, Espa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|Roman bridge [[Puente de Alc\u00e1ntara]]]]\n[[File:Cueva de H\u00e9rcules - 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman [[Cave of Hercules]], part of the sight [[Subterranean Toledo]]]]\nToledo (<small>Latin:</small> ''Toletum'') is mentioned by the Roman historian Livy (ca. 59 BC \u2013 17 AD) as ''urbs parva, sed loco munita'' (\"a small city, but fortified by location\").

Although Theudis and Athangild based themselves in Toledo, Toledo was not yet the capital city of the Iberian peninsula, as Theudis and Athangild's power was limited in extent, the [[Suevi]] ruling [[Gallaecia|Galicia]] and local elites dominating [[Lusitania]], [[Hispania Baetica|Betica]], and Cantabria.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kulikowski|first1=Michael|title=Late Roman Spain and Its Cities|date=2004|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|pages=282\u2013284}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|page=54}}</ref> This changed with [[Liuvigild]] (Leovigild), who brought the peninsula under his control.

King [[Sisebut]] forced Jews in the Visigothic kingdom to convert to Christianity; this act was criticized and efforts were made to reverse it at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] in 633.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|page=76}}</ref> The [[Fifth Council of Toledo|Fifth]] and [[Sixth Council of Toledo|Sixth]] Councils of Toledo placed church sanctions on anyone who would challenge the Visigothic kings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|page=82}}</ref> The [[Seventh Council of Toledo]] instituted a requirement that all bishops in the area of a royal city, that is, of Toledo, must reside for one month per year in Toledo.

The ban on lifing these sentences of excommunication was lifted at the [[Eighth Council of Toledo]] in 653, at which, for the first time, decisions were signed by palace officials as well as bishops.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|page=88}}</ref>\n\nThe eighth council of Toledo took measures that enhanced Toledo's significance as the center of royal power in the Iberian peninsula. The council declared that the election of a new king following the death of the old one should only take place in the royal city, or wherever the old king died.<ref name=\"Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711\">{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|page=89}}</ref> In practice this handed the power to choose kings to only such palace officials and military commanders who were in regular attendance on the king. The decision also took king-making power away from the bishops, who would be in their own sees and would not have time to come together to attend the royal election. The decision did allow the bishop of Toledo, alone among bishops, to be involved in decisions concerning the royal Visigothic succession. The [[Ninth Council of Toledo|ninth]] and [[Tenth Council of Toledo|tenth]] councils were held in rapid succession in 655 and 656.<ref name=\"Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711\"/>\n\n[[File:Toledo PM 079694 E.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Visigothic decorative reliefs in the [[Mezquita-Iglesia de El Salvador, Toledo|Mezquita-Iglesia de El Salvador]]]]\nWhen [[Reccesuinth]] died in 672 at his villa in Gerticos, his successor [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] was elected on the spot, then went to Toledo to be anointed king by the bishop of Toledo, according to the procedures laid out in prior church councils.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|page=93}}</ref> In 673, Wamba defeated a rebel duke named Paul, and held his victory parade in Toledo.

Wamba weakened the power of the bishop of Toledo by creating a new bishopric outside Toledo at the church of Saints Peter and Paul. This was one of the main churches of Toledo and was the church where Wamba was anointed king, and the church from which Visigothic kings departed for war after special ceremonies in which they were presented with a relic of the [[True Cross]]. By creating a new bishopric there, Wamba removed power over royal succession from the bishop of Toledo and granted it to the new bishop.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|page=100}}</ref> The [[Twelfth Council of Toledo]] was held in 681 after Wamba's removal from office. Convinced that he was dying, Wamba had accepted a state of [[penitence]] that according to the decision of a previous church council, made him ineligible to remain king. The Twelfth Council, led by newly installed bishop [[Julian of Toledo|Julian]] confirmed the validity of Wamba's removal from office and his succession by [[Erwig|Ervig]]. The Twelfth Council eliminated the new bishopric that Wamba had created and returned the powers over succession to the bishop of Toledo.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|page=101}}</ref>\n\nThe Twelfth Council of Toledo approved 28 laws against the Jews.

After the fall of the caliphate, Toledo was the capital city of one of the richest [[Taifa]]s of [[Al-Andalus]]. Its population was overwhelmingly [[Muladi]], and, because of its central location in the Iberian Peninsula, Toledo took a central position in the struggles between the Muslim and Christian rulers of northern Spain. The conquest of Toledo by [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI of Castile]] in 1085 marked the first time a major city in Al-Andalus was captured by Christian forces; it served to sharpen the religious aspect of the Christian reconquest.\n\n===Medieval Toledo after the Reconquista===\n[[File:Braun Toledo UBHD.jpg|thumb|230px|Toledo in the 16th century]]\n[[File:El Greco - View and Plan of Toledo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''[[View of Toledo]]'' by city resident [[El Greco]] c. 1608.]]\nOn May 25, 1085, Alfonso VI of Castile took Toledo and established direct personal control over the Moorish city from which he had been exacting tribute, ending the medieval [[Taifa]]'s [[Kingdom of Toledo]]. This was the first concrete step taken by the combined kingdom of Leon-Castile in the [[Reconquista]] by Christian forces. After Castilian conquest, Toledo continued to be a major cultural centre; its Arab libraries were not pillaged, and a tag-team [[Toledo School of Translators|translation centre]] was established in which books in Arabic or Hebrew would be translated into Castilian by Muslim and Jewish scholars, and from Castilian into Latin by Castilian scholars, thus letting long-lost knowledge spread through Christian Europe again. Toledo served as the capital city of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] intermittently (Castile did not have a permanent capital) from 1085, and the city flourished. Under the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo]] multiple persecutions (633, 653, 693) and stake burnings of Jews (638 CE) occurred; the [[Kingdom of Toledo]] followed up on this tradition (1368, 1391, 1449, 1486\u20131490 CE) including forced conversions and mass murder and the rioting and blood bath against the Jews of Toledo (1212 CE).<ref name=STR-JewishPersecution>{{cite web|last1=Grosser|first1=P.E. and E.G.

Between the 15th and 17th centuries the Toledo sword-making industry enjoyed a great boom, to the point where its [[Toledo steel|products]] came to be regarded as the best in Europe. Swords and daggers were made by individual craftsmen, although the sword-makers guild oversaw their quality. In the late 17th and early 18th century production began to decline, prompting the creation of the Royal Arms Factory in 1761 by order of [[King Carlos III]]. The Royal Factory brought together all the sword-makers guilds of the city and it was located in the former mint. In 1777, recognizing the need to expand the space, Carlos III commissioned the architect [[Francesco Sabatini|Sabatini]] to construct a new building on the outskirts of the city. This was the beginning of several phases of expansion. Its importance was such that it eventually developed into a city within the city of Toledo.\n\nIn the 20th century, the production of knives and swords for the army was reduced to cavalry weapons only, and after the [[Spanish Civil War]], to the supply of swords to the officers and NCOs of the various military units. Following the closure of the factory in the 1980s, the building was renovated to house the campus of the Technological University of Castilla-La Mancha in Toledo.<ref name=ref_duplicada_1>{{cite web | title = lacerca.com \u2013 Las espadas forjadas en Toledo se remontan a la \u00e9poca romana | url = http://www.lacerca.com/noticias/las_espadas_forjadas_toledo_se_remontan_epoca_romana-21888-1.html | accessdate = 15 July 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080802121638/http://www.lacerca.com/noticias/las_espadas_forjadas_toledo_se_remontan_epoca_romana-21888-1.html | archivedate = 2 August 2008 }}</ref> According to the Statistical Institute of Castilla-La Mancha, in 2007 the recent distribution of employment by sectors of occupation was as follows: 86.5% of the population engaged in the services, 6.6% in construction, 5.4% in industry and 1.5% in agriculture and livestock.<ref name=\"estadistica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ies.jccm.es/Fichas_municipales/Fichas/45168.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213143119/http://www.ies.jccm.es/Fichas_municipales/Fichas/45168.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 December 2009|title=Instituto de Estad\u00edstica de Castilla-La Mancha \u2013 Ficha municipal|accessdate=21 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Unemployment===\nIn the decade to 2008, unemployment in absolute terms remained fairly stable in the city of Toledo, but in 2009 this figure increased significantly: nearly 62% compared to 2008, with the number of unemployed rising from 2,515 to 4,074 (figures at 31 March each year), according to the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla La Mancha.<ref name=\"paro\">{{cite web | title = Instituto de Estad\u00edstica de la Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha \u2013 Datos estad\u00edsticos de Toledo (Todos los Informes > Informes por Temas > Estad\u00edsticas Municipales > Mercado de Trabajo) | url = http://difusion.ies.jccm.es/wds/ReportFolders/ReportFolders.aspx | accessdate=5 April 2009 }}</ref> Of this 62%, one third of the increase took place in the first quarter.\n\nAccording to other statistics from the same source, almost half the unemployed in the city of Toledo (1,970 persons) are among those whose education does not go beyond the compulsory secondary level.

The earliest, directed against [[Priscillian]], assembled in 400. At the synod of 589 the Visigothic King [[Reccared I|Reccared]] declared his conversion from [[Arianism]] to [[Catholicism]]; the synod of 633 decreed uniformity of catholic liturgy throughout the Visigothic kingdom and took stringent measures against baptized Jews who had relapsed into their former faith. Other councils forbade circumcision, Jewish rites and observance of the Sabbath and festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font.<ref>S. Katz, ''The Jews in the Visigothic Kingdoms of Spain and Gaul'', (Cambridge 1937). Cited in [[Paul Johnson (writer)]], ''A History of the Jews'', p. 177</ref> The council of 681 assured to the [[Archdiocese of Toledo|archbishop of Toledo]] the [[primate (bishop)|primacy]] of Spain. At [[Guadamur]], very close to Toledo, was dug in 1858 the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]], the best example of [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic art]] in Spain.\n\nAs nearly one hundred early canons of Toledo found a place in the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', they exerted an important influence on the development of [[Canon law|ecclesiastical law]]. The synod of 1565\u20131566 concerned itself with the execution of the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]; and the last council held at Toledo, 1582\u20131583, was guided in detail by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].\n\nToledo had large communities of Muslims and Jews until they were [[Alhambra Decree|expelled from Spain in 1492]] (Jews) and 1502 ([[Mud\u00e9jar]]s). Today's city contains the religious monuments the [[Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca|Synagogue of Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca]], the [[Synagogue of El Transito]], [[Mosque of Cristo de la Luz]] and the [[Church of San Sebasti\u00e1n, Toledo|church of San Sebasti\u00e1n]] dating from before the expulsion, still maintained in good condition. Among [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]-speaking [[Sephardi Jews]], in their various diasporas, the [[family name]] [[Toledano]] is still prevalent \u2013 indicating an ancestry traced back to this city (the name is also attested among non-Jews in various [[Spanish language|Spanish-speaking countries]]).\n\nIn the 13th century, Toledo was a major cultural centre under the guidance of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]], called \"El Sabio\" (\"the Wise\") for his love of learning. The [[Toledo School of Translators]], that had commenced under Archbishop [[Raymond de Sauvet\u00e2t|Raymond of Toledo]], continued to bring vast stores of knowledge to Europe by rendering great academic and philosophical works in Arabic into Latin. The [[Palacio de Galiana]], built in the [[Mud\u00e9jar]] style, is one of the monuments that remain from that period.\n\nThe [[Cathedral of Toledo]] (''Catedral de Toledo'') was built between 1226 and 1493 and modeled after the [[Bourges Cathedral]], though it also combines some characteristics of the [[Mud\u00e9jar]] style. It is remarkable for its incorporation of light and features the [[Baroque]] altar called ''[[El Transparente]]'', several stories high, with fantastic figures of stucco, paintings, bronze castings, and multiple colors of marble, a masterpiece of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[mixed media]] by [[Narciso Tom\u00e9]] topped by the daily effect for just a few minutes of a shaft of light from which this feature of the cathedral derives its name. Two notable bridges secured access to Toledo across the Tajo, the [[Puente de Alc\u00e1ntara, Toledo|Alc\u00e1ntara bridge]] and the later built [[Puente de San Mart\u00edn (Toledo)|San Mart\u00edn bridge]].\n\nThe [[Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes, Toledo|Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes]] is a [[Franciscan]] [[monastery]], built 1477\u20131504, in a remarkable combination of Gothic-Spanish-Flemish style with [[Mud\u00e9jar]] ornamentation.\n\nToledo was home to [[El Greco]] for the latter part of his life, and is the subject of some of his most famous paintings, including ''[[The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]]'', exhibited in the Church of Santo Tom\u00e9.\n\nWhen Philip II moved the [[royal court]] from Toledo to [[Madrid]] in 1561, the old city went into a slow decline from which it never recovered.\n\n===Toledo steel===\n{{Main|Toledo steel}}\nToledo has been a traditional sword-making, steel-working centre since about 500 BC, and came to the attention of Rome when used by [[Hannibal]] in the [[Punic Wars]].
