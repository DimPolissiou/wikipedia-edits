He read Enlightenment philosophers, and wished to put their ideas into action.\n\nIn 1770, he bought the [[bastide]] of Puget in [[Fuveau]] and became nobleman.

Around this time, just before the [[French revolution]], he was referred to as a [[communist]] in a book review by [[Restif de la Bretonne]]; according to some sources, this was the first time that the word \"communism\" was used in print in its modern sense.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Victor d'Hupay became enthusiastic about new ideas. He corresponded with Mirabeau and [[Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]]. He presented several projects of national education and models of government to the National Assembly, and militated for the suppression of marriage, which he saw as a form property owning. Despite his commitment to the revolution, he was imprisoned under the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]] and his house was looted. He wrote a little under the Empire and died at Fuveau in 1818, at the age of seventy-two.\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|title=Quelques dates \u00e0 propos des termes communiste et communisme|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/mots_0243-6450_1983_num_7_1_1122|first= Jacques |last=Grandjonc|journal= Mots|year= 1983 |volume = 7|issue=1 |pages=143\u2013148|doi=10.3406/mots.1983.1122}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191812/http://www.hupay.fr/ Website devoted to Victor d'Hupay]\n\n<references />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hupay de Fuveau, Victor}}\n[[Category:French political writers]]\n[[Category:French communists]]\n[[Category:18th-century French writers]]\n[[Category:18th-century male writers]]\n[[Category:People from Vaucluse]]\n[[Category:People from Aix-en-Provence]]\n[[Category:1746 births]]\n[[Category:1818 deaths]]\n[[Category:French male writers]]\n[[Category:French male essayists]]\n[[Category:18th-century essayists]]\n\n\n{{France-writer-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name               = Victor d'Hupay\n| image              = Portrait de Victor d'Hupay (cropped).png\n| caption            = Portrait of Victor d'Hupay (ca.1790)\n| birth_date         = 1746\n| birth_place        = [[La Tour-d'Aigues]], [[Provence]], [[France]]\n| death_date         = 1818 (Aged 72)\n| death_place        = [[Fuveau]], [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], [[France]]\n| nationality        = [[France|French]]\n}}'''Joseph Alexandre Victor d'Hupay''' (1746\u20131818) was a French writer and philosopher.

He was the author of many books and essays, which have had a significant influence in [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[semiotics]], [[literary theory]], [[history of ideas|intellectual history]] and [[culture theory]].\n\n==Early life==\nTzvetan Todorov was born on March 1, 1939, in Sofia, Bulgaria.<ref name=\"lemondeobit\">{{cite news|title=Tzvetan Todorov, essayiste et historien des id\u00e9es, est mort|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2017/02/07/l-essayiste-et-historien-des-idees-tzvetan-todorov-est-mort_5076045_3382.html|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=Le Monde|date=February 7, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"lexpressobit\">{{cite news|title=Le philosophe et historien Tzvetan Todorov est mort|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/le-philosophe-et-historien-tzvetan-todorov-est-mort_1876912.html|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=L'Express|date=February 7, 2017}}</ref> He earned an M.A. in philology at the [[University of Sofia]] in 1963. He enrolled at the University of Paris to do his [[doctorat de troisi\u00e8me cycle]] (equivalent to the Ph.D.) in 1966 and his [[doctorat \u00e8s lettres]] in 1970.\n\n==Career==\nTodorov was appointed to his post as a director of research at the French Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique in 1968. In 1970, he helped to found the journal ''Po\u00e9tique'',<ref name=\"lexpressobit\"/> of which he remained one of the managing editors until 1979. With structuralist literary critic [[G\u00e9rard Genette]], he edited the ''Collection Po\u00e9tique'', the series of books on literary theory published by \u00c9ditions de Seuil, until 1987. He was a visiting professor at several universities in the US, including [[Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].\n\nTodorov published a total of 39 books, including ''The Poetics of Prose'' (1971), ''Introduction to Poetics'' (1981), ''[[The Conquest of America: The Question of the Other]]'' (1982), ''[[Mikhail Bakhtin]]: The Dialogical Principle'' (1984), ''Facing the Extreme: Moral Life in the Concentration Camps'' (1991), ''On Human Diversity'' (1993), ''A French Tragedy: Scenes of Civil War, Summer 1944'' (1994), ''Voices from the Gulag: Life and Death in Communist Bulgaria'' (1999), ''Hope and Memory'' (2000), ''Imperfect Garden: The Legacy of Humanism'' (2002), ''In Defence of the Enlightenment'' (2009), ''Memory as a Remedy for Evil'' (2010), ''The Totalitarian Experience'' (2011), ''The Inner Enemies of Democracy'' (2014) and ''Insoumis'' (2015). Todorov's historical interests have focused on such crucial issues as the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquest of The Americas]] and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Stalinist]] [[concentration camps]].\n\nTodorov's greatest contribution to literary theory was his definition, in ''Introduction \u00e0 la litt\u00e9rature fantastique'' (1970), of the [[Fantastic]], the fantastic uncanny, and the fantastic marvelous. Todorov defines the fantastic as being any event that happens in our world that seems to be supernatural. Upon the occurrence of the event, we must decide if the event was an illusion or whether it is real and has actually taken place. Todorov uses Alvaro from [[Jacques Cazotte]]'s ''[[The Devil in Love (novel)|Le Diable amoureux]]'' as an example of a fantastic event. Alvaro must decide whether the woman he is in love with is truly a woman or if she is the devil.\n\nUpon choosing whether the event was real or imaginary, Todorov says that we enter into the genres of uncanny and marvelous.  In the fantastic uncanny, the event that occurs is actually an illusion of some sort.  The \"laws of reality\" remain intact and also provide a rational explanation for the fantastic event. Todorov gives examples of dreams, drugs, illusions of the senses, madness, etc. as things that could explain a fantastic/supernatural event. In the fantastic marvelous, the supernatural event that occurs has actually taken place and therefore the \"laws of reality\" have to be changed to explain the event. Only if the implied reader cannot opt for one or the other possibility is the text purely fantastic.\n\nAside from his work in literary theory, Todorov has also published studies of philosophy. He wrote ''Frail Happiness'' about the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. He focuses on Rousseau's ideas of attaining human happiness and how we can live in 'modern' times.\n\nIn one of his major works, ''[[Facing the Extreme]]'', Todorov asks whether it is true the Nazi concentration camps and the Soviet gulags revealed that in extreme situations \"all traces of moral life evaporate as men become beasts locked in a merciless struggle for survival\" (31\u201346). That opinion is commonplace of popularized accounts of the camps, and also appears in accounts of survivors themselves. [[Primo Levi]], quoted in Todorov, writes that camp life is a \"continuous war of everyone against everyone.\" To survive, all dignity and conscience had to be sacrificed and everyone is alone. Reports from gulag survivors are similar. However, in his reading of actual survivor testimonies, Todorov says the picture is not that bleak, that there are many examples of inmates helping each other and showing compassion in human relationships despite the inhumane conditions and terror. Survivors point out that survival always depended on the help of others. He concludes that life in the camps and gulag did not follow the law of the jungle and that the counter-examples are numerous, even in Levi's work.\n\nTodorov's honors include the [[CNRS Bronze Medal]], the Charles L\u00e9v\u00eaque Prize of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques and the first Maugean Prize of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] and the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for Social Sciences; he was also an Officer of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]. He also received the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences. In 2015, he was awarded the [Wayne C. Booth] Award for lifetime achievement in narrative studies by the [[International Society for the Study of Narrative]].\n\n==Personal life and death==\nTodorov was married twice. His first wife was the scholar Martine van Woerkens and his second was [[Nancy Huston]],<ref name=\"lemondeobit\"/> with whom he had two children, until 2014.<ref name=\"lexpressobit\"/> He died on February 7, 2017, at the age of 77.<ref name=\"lemondeobit\"/> He is survived by a son, Boris, from the first marriage, and a daughter, L\u00e9a, and a son, Sacha, from the second.\n\n==Bibliography==\n;Books\n*''Introduction \u00e0 la litt\u00e9rature fantastique'' (1970), translated by Richard Howard as ''The Fantastic: A Structural Approach to a Literary Genre'' in 1973\n*''Theories of the Symbol'' (1982), translated by Catherine Porter\n*''Symbolism and Interpretation'' (1982), translated by Catherine Porter\n*''[[Conquest of America: The Question of the Other]]'' (1984), translated from the French by Richard Howard\n*''Mikhail Bakhtin: the dialogical principle'' (1984), translated by [[Wlad Godzich]]\n*''On human diversity: nationalism, racism, and exoticism in French thought'' (1993), translated by Catherine Porter\n*''French tragedy: scenes of civil war, summer 1944'' (1996), translated by Mary Byrd Kelly; translation edited and annotated by Richard J.

[[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]]-[[France|French]] [[historian]], [[philosopher]], [[Structuralism|structuralist]] [[literary critic]], [[sociologist]], [[essayist]] and [[geologist]]. He was the author of many books and essays, which have had a significant influence in [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[semiotics]], [[literary theory]], [[history of ideas|intellectual history]] and [[culture theory]].\n\n==Early life==\nTzvetan Todorov was born on March 1, 1939, in Sofia, Bulgaria.<ref name=\"lemondeobit\">{{cite news|title=Tzvetan Todorov, essayiste et historien des id\u00e9es, est mort|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2017/02/07/l-essayiste-et-historien-des-idees-tzvetan-todorov-est-mort_5076045_3382.html|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=Le Monde|date=February 7, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"lexpressobit\">{{cite news|title=Le philosophe et historien Tzvetan Todorov est mort|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/le-philosophe-et-historien-tzvetan-todorov-est-mort_1876912.html|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=L'Express|date=February 7, 2017}}</ref> He earned an M.A. in philology at the [[University of Sofia]] in 1963. He enrolled at the University of Paris to do his [[doctorat de troisi\u00e8me cycle]] (equivalent to the Ph.D.) in 1966 and his [[doctorat \u00e8s lettres]] in 1970.\n\n==Career==\nTodorov was appointed to his post as a director of research at the French Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique in 1968. In 1970, he helped to found the journal ''Po\u00e9tique'',<ref name=\"lexpressobit\"/> of which he remained one of the managing editors until 1979. With structuralist literary critic [[G\u00e9rard Genette]], he edited the ''Collection Po\u00e9tique'', the series of books on literary theory published by \u00c9ditions de Seuil, until 1987. He was a visiting professor at several universities in the US, including [[Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].\n\nTodorov published a total of 39 books, including ''The Poetics of Prose'' (1971), ''Introduction to Poetics'' (1981), ''[[The Conquest of America: The Question of the Other]]'' (1982), ''[[Mikhail Bakhtin]]: The Dialogical Principle'' (1984), ''Facing the Extreme: Moral Life in the Concentration Camps'' (1991), ''On Human Diversity'' (1993), ''A French Tragedy: Scenes of Civil War, Summer 1944'' (1994), ''Voices from the Gulag: Life and Death in Communist Bulgaria'' (1999), ''Hope and Memory'' (2000), ''Imperfect Garden: The Legacy of Humanism'' (2002), ''In Defence of the Enlightenment'' (2009), ''Memory as a Remedy for Evil'' (2010), ''The Totalitarian Experience'' (2011), ''The Inner Enemies of Democracy'' (2014) and ''Insoumis'' (2015). Todorov's historical interests have focused on such crucial issues as the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquest of The Americas]] and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Stalinist]] [[concentration camps]].\n\nTodorov's greatest contribution to literary theory was his definition, in ''Introduction \u00e0 la litt\u00e9rature fantastique'' (1970), of the [[Fantastic]], the fantastic uncanny, and the fantastic marvelous. Todorov defines the fantastic as being any event that happens in our world that seems to be supernatural. Upon the occurrence of the event, we must decide if the event was an illusion or whether it is real and has actually taken place. Todorov uses Alvaro from [[Jacques Cazotte]]'s ''[[The Devil in Love (novel)|Le Diable amoureux]]'' as an example of a fantastic event. Alvaro must decide whether the woman he is in love with is truly a woman or if she is the devil.\n\nUpon choosing whether the event was real or imaginary, Todorov says that we enter into the genres of uncanny and marvelous.  In the fantastic uncanny, the event that occurs is actually an illusion of some sort.  The \"laws of reality\" remain intact and also provide a rational explanation for the fantastic event. Todorov gives examples of dreams, drugs, illusions of the senses, madness, etc. as things that could explain a fantastic/supernatural event. In the fantastic marvelous, the supernatural event that occurs has actually taken place and therefore the \"laws of reality\" have to be changed to explain the event. Only if the implied reader cannot opt for one or the other possibility is the text purely fantastic.\n\nAside from his work in literary theory, Todorov has also published studies of philosophy. He wrote ''Frail Happiness'' about the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. He focuses on Rousseau's ideas of attaining human happiness and how we can live in 'modern' times.\n\nIn one of his major works, ''[[Facing the Extreme]]'', Todorov asks whether it is true the Nazi concentration camps and the Soviet gulags revealed that in extreme situations \"all traces of moral life evaporate as men become beasts locked in a merciless struggle for survival\" (31\u201346). That opinion is commonplace of popularized accounts of the camps, and also appears in accounts of survivors themselves. [[Primo Levi]], quoted in Todorov, writes that camp life is a \"continuous war of everyone against everyone.\" To survive, all dignity and conscience had to be sacrificed and everyone is alone. Reports from gulag survivors are similar. However, in his reading of actual survivor testimonies, Todorov says the picture is not that bleak, that there are many examples of inmates helping each other and showing compassion in human relationships despite the inhumane conditions and terror. Survivors point out that survival always depended on the help of others. He concludes that life in the camps and gulag did not follow the law of the jungle and that the counter-examples are numerous, even in Levi's work.\n\nTodorov's honors include the [[CNRS Bronze Medal]], the Charles L\u00e9v\u00eaque Prize of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques and the first Maugean Prize of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] and the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for Social Sciences; he was also an Officer of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]. He also received the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences. In 2015, he was awarded the [Wayne C. Booth] Award for lifetime achievement in narrative studies by the [[International Society for the Study of Narrative]].\n\n==Personal life and death==\nTodorov was married twice. His first wife was the scholar Martine van Woerkens and his second was [[Nancy Huston]],<ref name=\"lemondeobit\"/> with whom he had two children, until 2014.<ref name=\"lexpressobit\"/> He died on February 7, 2017, at the age of 77.<ref name=\"lemondeobit\"/> He is survived by a son, Boris, from the first marriage, and a daughter, L\u00e9a, and a son, Sacha, from the second.\n\n==Bibliography==\n;Books\n*''Introduction \u00e0 la litt\u00e9rature fantastique'' (1970), translated by Richard Howard as ''The Fantastic: A Structural Approach to a Literary Genre'' in 1973\n*''Theories of the Symbol'' (1982), translated by Catherine Porter\n*''Symbolism and Interpretation'' (1982), translated by Catherine Porter\n*''[[Conquest of America: The Question of the Other]]'' (1984), translated from the French by Richard Howard\n*''Mikhail Bakhtin: the dialogical principle'' (1984), translated by [[Wlad Godzich]]\n*''On human diversity: nationalism, racism, and exoticism in French thought'' (1993), translated by Catherine Porter\n*''French tragedy: scenes of civil war, summer 1944'' (1996), translated by Mary Byrd Kelly; translation edited and annotated by Richard J.

Samyro'''; {{OldStyleDate|16 April|1896|4 April}} &ndash; 25 December 1963) was a Romanian and French [[avant-garde]] poet, essayist and [[performance art]]ist. Also active as a journalist, playwright, literary and art critic, composer and film director, he was known best for being one of the founders and central figures of the [[anti-establishment]] [[Dada]] movement. Under the influence of [[Adrian Maniu]], the adolescent Tzara became interested in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and co-founded the magazine ''[[Simbolul]]'' with [[Ion Vinea]] (with whom he also wrote [[Experimental literature|experimental]] poetry) and painter [[Marcel Janco]]. During [[World War I]], after briefly collaborating on Vinea's ''[[Chemarea]]'', he joined Janco in Switzerland. There, Tzara's shows at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Z\u00fcrich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and [[Z\u00fcnfte of Z\u00fcrich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]], as well as his poetry and [[art manifesto]]s, became a main feature of early Dadaism. His work represented Dada's [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] side, in contrast with the more moderate approach favored by [[Hugo Ball]].\n\nAfter moving to Paris in 1919, Tzara, by then one of the \"presidents of Dada\", joined the staff of ''[[Litt\u00e9rature]]'' magazine, which marked the first step in the movement's evolution toward [[Surrealism]]. He was involved in the major polemics which led to Dada's split, defending his principles against [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] and [[Francis Picabia]], and, in Romania, against the [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] [[modernism]] of Vinea and Janco. This personal vision on art defined his Dadaist plays ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' (1921) and ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'' (1924). A forerunner of [[Surrealist automatism|automatist techniques]], Tzara eventually aligned himself with Breton's Surrealism, and under its influence wrote his celebrated [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian poem]] ''[[The Approximate Man]]''.\n\nDuring the final part of his career, Tzara combined his [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] perspective with a [[Communism|communist]] vision, joining the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]], and serving a term in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. Having spoken in favor of [[liberalization]] in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] just before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]], he distanced himself from the [[French Communist Party]], of which he was by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the [[Algerian War]].\n\nTristan Tzara was an influential author and performer, whose contribution is credited with having created a connection from [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] to the [[Beat Generation]], [[Situationist International|Situationism]] and various currents in [[rock music]]. The friend and collaborator of many modernist figures, he was the lover of dancer [[Maja Kruscek]] in his early youth and was later married to Swedish artist and poet [[Greta Knutson]].\n\n==Name==\n''S.

Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] sees ''Simbolul'' as a main stage in Romania's [[modernism]], and credits it with having brought about the first changes from Symbolism to the radical avant-garde.<ref>Cernat, p.49-54, 397-398, 412</ref> Also according to Cernat, the collaboration between Samyro, Vinea and Janco was an early instance of literature becoming \"an interface between arts\", which had for its contemporary equivalent the collaboration between Iser and writers such as [[Ion Minulescu]] and [[Tudor Arghezi]].<ref>Cernat, p.47</ref> Although Maniu parted with the group and sought a change in style which brought him closer to traditionalist tenets, Tzara, Janco and Vinea continued their collaboration. Between 1913 and 1915, they were frequently vacationing together, either on the [[Black Sea]] coast or at the Rosenstock family property in [[G\u00e2rceni]], [[Vaslui County]]; during this time, Vinea and Samyro wrote poems with similar themes and alluding to one another.<ref>Cernat, p.116-121</ref>\n\n===''Chemarea'' and 1915 departure===\nTzara's career changed course between 1914 and 1916, during a period when the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] kept out of [[World War I]]. In autumn 1915, as founder and editor of the short-lived journal ''[[Chemarea]]'', Vinea published two poems by his friend, the first printed works to bear the signature ''Tristan Tzara''.<ref>Cernat, p.97, 106, 108-109</ref> At the time, the young poet and many of his friends were adherents of an [[anti-war]] and anti-[[Nationalism|nationalist]] current, which progressively accommodated [[anti-establishment]] messages.<ref>Cernat, p.99, 100-108</ref> ''Chemarea'', which was a platform for this agenda and again attracted collaborations from Chapier, may also have been financed by Tzara and Vinea.<ref name=\"pcern99\"/> According to Romanian avant-garde writer [[Claude Sernet]], the journal was \"totally different from everything that had been printed in Romania before that moment.\"<ref>Cernat, p.100</ref> During the period, Tzara's works were sporadically published in Hefter-Hidalgo's ''[[Versuri \u0219i Proz\u0103]]'', and, in June 1915, [[Constantin R\u0103dulescu-Motru]]'s ''[[Noua Revist\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103]]'' published Samyro's known poem ''Veri\u0219oar\u0103, fat\u0103 de pension'' (\"Little Cousin, Boarding School Girl\").<ref name=\"Cernat, p.108-109\"/>\n\nTzara had enrolled at the [[University of Bucharest]] in 1914, studying mathematics and philosophy, but did not graduate.<ref name=\"iliv241\"/><ref name=\"ttunifi\">{{in lang|it}} [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/CMpro-v-p-1020.html \"Tristan Tzara\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605084429/http://www.unifi.it/letrum/CMpro-v-p-1020.html |date=5 June 2011 }}, biographical note in [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/ ''Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780-1914)'' database], at the [[University of Florence]]'s Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved 23 April 2008</ref> In autumn 1915, he left Romania for Z\u00fcrich, in neutral Switzerland.

In February 1916, Ball had rented the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Z\u00fcrich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] from its owner, Jan Ephraim, and intended to use the venue for [[performance art]] and exhibits.<ref>Cernat, p.110-111; Hofman, p.2; Richter, p.12-14</ref> Hugo Ball recorded this period, noting that Tzara and Marcel Janco, like [[Hans Arp]], [[Arthur Segal (painter)|Arthur Segal]], [[Otto van Rees]], [[Max Oppenheimer]], and [[Marcel S\u0142odki]], \"readily agreed to take part in the cabaret.\"<ref name=\"Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14\">Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14</ref> According to Ball, among the performances of songs mimicking or taking inspiration from various national [[folklore]]s, \"Herr Tristan Tzara recited Rumanian poetry<!-- sic -->.\"<ref>Cernat, p.111; Gendron, p.73; Richter, p.14</ref> In late March, Ball recounted, the group was joined by German writer and drummer [[Richard Huelsenbeck]].<ref name=\"Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14\"/> He was soon after involved in Tzara's \"simultaneist verse\" performance, \"the first in Z\u00fcrich and in the world\", also including renditions of poems by two promoters of [[Cubism]], [[Fernand Divoire]] and [[Henri Barzun]].<ref>Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14, 28-30</ref>\n\n===Birth of Dada===\n[[File:Placa en Cabaret Voltaire retouched.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Cabaret Voltaire (Z\u00fcrich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] plaque commemorating the birth of Dada]]\nIt was in this milieu that [[Dada]] was born, at some point before May 1916, when a publication of the same name first saw print. The story of its establishment was the subject of a disagreement between Tzara and his fellow writers. Cernat believes that the first Dadaist performance took place as early as February, when the nineteen-year-old Tzara, wearing a [[monocle]], entered the Cabaret Voltaire stage singing sentimental melodies and handing paper wads to his \"scandalized spectators\", leaving the stage to allow room for masked actors on [[stilts]], and returning in clown attire.<ref name=\"pcern112\">Cernat, p.112</ref> The same type of performances took place at the [[Z\u00fcnfte of Z\u00fcrich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]] beginning in summer 1916, after the Cabaret Voltaire was forced to close down.<ref>Cernat, p.115; Gendron, p.73-75; Hofman, p.3; Richter, p.39, 41-44, 48</ref> According to music historian Bernard Gendron, for as long as it lasted, \"the Cabaret Voltaire was dada. There was no alternative institution or site that could disentangle 'pure' dada from its mere accompaniment [...] nor was any such site desired.\"<ref>Gendron, p.75</ref> Other opinions link Dada's beginnings with much earlier events, including the experiments of [[Alfred Jarry]], [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], [[Christian Morgenstern]], [[Jean-Pierre Brisset]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Jacques Vach\u00e9]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] or [[Francis Picabia]].<ref>Richter, p.11, 71-72, 81-100, 168-173</ref>\n\nIn the first of the movement's manifestos, Ball wrote: \"[The booklet] is intended to present to the Public the activities and interests of the Cabaret Voltaire, which has as its sole purpose to draw attention, across the barriers of war and nationalism, to the few independent spirits who live for other ideals. The next objective of the artists who are assembled here is to publish a ''revue internationale'' [French for \"international magazine\"].\"<ref name=\"hrich14\">Richter, p.14</ref> Ball completed his message in French, and the paragraph translates as: \"The magazine shall be published in Z\u00fcrich and shall carry the name 'Dada' ('Dada'). Dada Dada Dada Dada.\"<ref name=\"hrich14\"/> The view according to which Ball had created the movement was notably supported by writer [[Walter Serner]], who directly accused Tzara of having abused Ball's initiative.<ref name=\"hrich123\">Richter, p.123</ref>\n\nA secondary point of contention between the founders of Dada regarded the paternity for the movement's name, which, according to visual artist and essayist [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], was first adopted in print in June 1916.<ref name=\"hrich32\">Richter, p.32</ref> Ball, who claimed authorship and stated that he picked the word randomly from a dictionary, indicated that it stood for both the French-language equivalent of \"[[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]]\" and a [[German language|German-language]] term reflecting the joy of children being rocked to sleep.<ref>Cernat, p.115-116; Richter, p.31-32</ref> Tzara himself declined interest in the matter, but Marcel Janco credited him with having coined the term.<ref>Cernat, p.115-116</ref> Dada manifestos, written or co-authored by Tzara, record that the name shares its form with various other terms, including a word used in the [[Kru languages]] of [[West Africa]] to designate the tail of a sacred cow; a toy and the name for \"mother\" in an unspecified [[Regional Italian|Italian dialect]]; and the double affirmative in Romanian and in various [[Slavic languages]].<ref>Cernat, p.116; Londr\u00e9, p.397; Richter, p.31-32</ref>\n\n===Dadaist promoter===\nBefore the end of the war, Tzara had assumed a position as Dada's main promoter and manager, helping the Swiss group establish branches in other European countries.<ref name=\"mrdada\"/><ref>Cardinal, p.529; Hofman, p.3-4; Cernat, p.115; Livezeanu, p.249-251; Londr\u00e9, p.396; Richter, p.33</ref> This period also saw the first conflict within the group: citing irreconcilable differences with Tzara, Ball left the group.<ref>Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.43, 59</ref> With his departure, Gendron argues, Tzara was able to move Dada [[vaudeville]]-like performances into more of \"an incendiary and yet jocularly provocative theater.\"<ref name=\"bgend77\">Gendron, p.77</ref>\n\nHe is often credited with having inspired many young modernist authors from outside Switzerland to affiliate with the group, in particular the Frenchmen [[Louis Aragon]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], [[Paul \u00c9luard]], [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] and [[Philippe Soupault]].<ref name=\"jycmelusine\"/><ref name=\"hrich33\">Richter, p.33</ref> Richter, who also came into contact with Dada at this stage in its history, notes that these intellectuals often had a \"very cool and distant attitude to this new movement\" before being approached by the Romanian author.<ref name=\"hrich33\"/> In June 1916, he began editing and managing the periodical ''Dada'' as a successor of the short-lived magazine ''Cabaret Voltaire''\u2014Richter describes his \"energy, passion and talent for the job\", which he claims satisfied all Dadaists.<ref>Hofman, p.4; Richter, p.33</ref> He was at the time the lover of [[Maja Kruscek]], who was a student of [[Rudolf Laban]]; in Richter's account, their relationship was always tottering.<ref>Richter, p.45, 69-70</ref>\n\nAs early as 1916, Tristan Tzara took distance from the Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]], rejecting the [[Militarism|militarist]] and proto-[[Italian fascism|fascist]] stance of their leader [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].<ref>Cernat, p.193</ref> Richter notes that, by then, Dada had replaced Futurism as the leader of modernism, while continuing to build on its influence: \"we had swallowed Futurism\u2014bones, feathers and all. It is true that in the process of digestion all sorts of bones and feathers had been regurgitated.\"<ref name=\"hrich33\"/> Despite this and the fact that Dada did not make any gains in Italy, Tzara could count poets [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] and [[Alberto Savinio]], painters [[Gino Cantarelli]] and [[Aldo Fiozzi]], as well as a few other Italian Futurists, among the Dadaists.<ref>Richter, p.199, 201 (Haftmann, in Richter, p.217)</ref> Among the Italian authors supporting Dadaist manifestos and rallying with the Dada group was the poet, painter and in the future a fascist racial theorist [[Julius Evola]], who became a personal friend of Tzara.<ref name=\"buddevo\">S.

According to Hans Richter, it included, alongside Tzara himself, figures ranging from Ernst, Arp, Baader, Breton and Aragon to Kruscek, Evola, [[Rafael Lasso de la Vega]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Vicente Huidobro]], [[Francesco Meriano]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Fraenkel]].<ref>Richter, p.201</ref> Richter notes: \"I'm not sure if all the names who appear here would agree with the description.\"<ref>Richter, p.200-201</ref>\n\n===End of World War I===\nThe shows Tzara staged in Z\u00fcrich often turned into scandals or riots, and he was in permanent conflict with the [[Law enforcement in Switzerland|Swiss law enforcers]].<ref>Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.16, 19, 39</ref> Hans Richter speaks of a \"pleasure of letting fly at the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], which in Tristan Tzara took the form of coldly (or hotly) calculated insolence\" (''see [[\u00c9pater la bourgeoisie]]'').<ref>Richter, p.24</ref> In one instance, as part of a series of events in which Dadaists mocked established authors, Tzara and Arp falsely publicized that they were going to fight a [[duel]] in Rehalp, near Z\u00fcrich, and that they were going to have the popular novelist [[Jakob Christoph Heer]] for their witness.<ref>Richter, p.66-67</ref> Richter also reports that his Romanian colleague profited from Swiss neutrality to play the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and [[Central Powers]] against each other, obtaining art works and funds from both, making use of their need to stimulate their respective [[propaganda]] efforts.<ref>Richter, p.47-48</ref> While active as a promoter, Tzara also published his first volume of collected poetry, the 1918 ''Vingt-cinq po\u00e8mes'' (\"Twenty-five Poems\").<ref name=\"rcard530\">Cardinal, p.530</ref>\n\nA major event took place in autumn 1918, when [[Francis Picabia]], who was then publisher of ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]'' magazine and a distant Dada affiliate, visited Z\u00fcrich and introduced his colleagues there to his [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] views on art and reason.<ref>Richter, p.70-74</ref> In the [[United States]], Picabia, [[Man Ray]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] had earlier set up their own version of Dada. This circle, based in New York City, sought affiliation with Tzara's only in 1921, when they jokingly asked him to grant them permission to use \"Dada\" as their own name (to which Tzara replied: \"Dada belongs to everybody\").<ref>Hofman, p.12</ref> The visit was credited by Richter with boosting the Romanian author's status, but also with making Tzara himself \"switch suddenly from a position of balance between art and [[anti-art]] into the [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] regions of pure and joyful nothingness.\"<ref>Richter, p.71</ref> The movement subsequently organized its last major Swiss show, held at the Saal zur Kaufleutern, with choreography by [[Susanne Perrottet]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], and with the participation of [[K\u00e4the Wulff]], [[Hans Heusser]], Tzara, Hans Richter and [[Walter Serner]].<ref>Richter, p.74-78</ref> It was there that Serner read from his 1918 essay, whose very title advocated ''Letzte Lockerung'' (\"Final Dissolution\"): this part is believed to have caused the subsequent m\u00eal\u00e9e, during which the public attacked the performers and succeeded in interrupting, but not canceling, the show.<ref>Richter, p.78-80</ref>\n\nFollowing the November 1918 [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice with Germany]], Dada's evolution was marked by political developments. In October 1919, Tzara, Arp and [[Otto Flake]] began publishing ''[[Der Zeltweg]]'', a journal aimed at further popularizing Dada in a post-war world were the borders were again accessible.<ref name=\"Richter, p.80\">Richter, p.80</ref> Richter, who admits that the magazine was \"rather tame\", also notes that Tzara and his colleagues were dealing with the impact of [[communist revolution]]s, in particular the [[October Revolution]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|German revolts of 1918]], which \"had stirred men's minds, divided men's interests and diverted energies in the direction of political change.\"<ref name=\"Richter, p.80\"/> The same commentator however dismisses those accounts which, he believes, led readers to believe that ''Der Zeltweg'' was \"an association of revolutionary artists.\"<ref name=\"Richter, p.80\"/> According to one account rendered by historian Robert Levy, Tzara shared company with a group of Romanian [[Communism|communist]] students, and, as such, may have met with [[Ana Pauker]], who was later one of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s most prominent activists.<ref>Robert Levy, ''Ana Pauker: The Rise and Fall of a Jewish Communist'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, p.37. {{ISBN|0-520-22395-0}}</ref>\n\nArp and Janco drifted away from the movement ca. 1919, when they created the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]]-inspired workshop ''[[Das Neue Leben]]''.<ref name=\"pcern115\">Cernat, p.115</ref> In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity.<ref>Cernat, p.121-123, 181-183</ref> When Vinea submitted his poem ''Dolean\u021be'' (\"Grievances\") to be published by Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between the reserved tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.<ref>Cernat, p.123-124</ref>\n\n===Paris Dada===\n[[File:Jane Heap, John Rodker, Martha Dennison, Tristan Tzara, Margaret Anderson, ca. 1920s.jpg|thumb|330px|Tzara (second from right) in the 1920s, with [[Margaret C.

Paul Cernat notes that the association between Samyro and the Jancos, who were Jews, and their [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] colleagues, was one sign of a cultural dialogue, in which \"the openness of Romanian environments toward artistic modernity\" was stimulated by \"young emancipated Jewish writers.\"<ref>Cernat, p.34</ref> Salomon Schulman, a Swedish researcher of [[Yiddish literature]], argues that the combined influence of Yiddish folklore and [[Hasidic philosophy]] shaped European modernism in general and Tzara's style in particular,<ref>Cernat, p.35-36</ref> while American poet [[Andrei Codrescu]] speaks of Tzara as one in a [[Balkans|Balkan]] line of \"absurdist writing\", which also includes the Romanians [[Urmuz]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] and [[Emil Cioran]].<ref>Olson, p.40</ref> According to literary historian [[George C\u0103linescu]], Samyro's early poems deal with \"the voluptuousness over the strong scents of rural life, which is typical among Jews compressed into [[ghetto]]s.\"<ref name=\"gcal887\">C\u0103linescu, p.887</ref>\n\nTzara himself used elements alluding to his homeland in his early Dadaist performances. His collaboration with [[Maja Kruscek]] at [[Z\u00fcnfte of Z\u00fcrich|Zuntfhaus z\u00fcr Waag]] featured samples of [[African literature]], to which Tzara added Romanian-language fragments.<ref name=\"pcern115\"/> He is also known to have mixed elements of [[Romanian folklore]], and to have sung the native suburban [[romanza]] ''La moar\u0103 la H\u00e2r\u021ba'' (\"At the Mill in H\u00e2r\u021ba\") during at least one staging for Cabaret Voltaire.<ref>Cernat, p.182, 405</ref> Addressing the Romanian public in 1947, he claimed to have been captivated by \"the sweet language of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavian]] peasants\".<ref name=\"iliv246\"/>\n\nTzara nonetheless rebelled against his birthplace and upbringing. His earliest poems depict provincial Moldavia as a desolate and unsettling place. In Cernat's view, this imagery was in common use among Moldavian-born writers who also belonged to the avant-garde trend, notably [[Benjamin Fondane]] and [[George Bacovia]].<ref>Cernat, p.37-38</ref> Like in the cases of Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco and Fondane, Cernat proposes, Samyro sought self-exile to [[Western Europe]] as a \"modern, [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]]\" means of breaking with \"the peripheral condition\",<ref>Cernat, p.38</ref> which may also serve to explain the pun he selected for a pseudonym.<ref name=\"pcern110\"/> According to the same author, two important elements in this process were \"a maternal attachment and a break with paternal authority\", an \"[[Oedipus complex]]\" which he also argued was evident in the biographies of other Symbolist and avant-garde Romanian authors, from Urmuz to [[Mateiu Caragiale]].<ref>Cernat, p.18</ref> Unlike Vinea and the ''[[Contimporanul]]'' group, Cernat proposes, Tzara stood for radicalism and insurgency, which would also help explain their impossibility to communicate.<ref>Cernat, p.398, 403-405</ref> In particular, Cernat argues, the writer sought to emancipate himself from competing nationalisms, and addressed himself directly to the center of European culture, with [[Z\u00fcrich]] serving as a stage on his way to [[Paris]].<ref name=\"pcern115\"/> The 1916 ''Monsieur's Antipyrine's Manifesto'' featured a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] appeal: \"DADA remains within the framework of European weaknesses, it's still shit, but from now on we want to shit in different colors so as to adorn the zoo of art with all the flags of all the consulates.\"<ref name=\"pcern115\"/>\n\nWith time, Tristan Tzara came to be regarded by his Dada associates as an exotic character, whose attitudes were intrinsically linked with [[Eastern Europe]]. Early on, Ball referred to him and the Janco brothers as \"Orientals\".<ref name=\"pcern112\"/> [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]] believed him to be a fiery and impulsive figure, having little in common with his German collaborators.<ref>Cernat, p.112; Richter, p.18-20, 24, 36, 37, 59</ref> According to Cernat, Richter's perspective seems to indicate a vision of Tzara having a \"[[Italic peoples|Latin]]\" temperament.<ref name=\"pcern112\"/> This type of perception also had negative implications for Tzara, particularly after the 1922 split within Dada. In the 1940s, [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] alleged that his former colleague had always been separated from other Dadaists by his failure to appreciate the legacy of \"[[Humanism in Germany|German humanism]]\", and that, compared to his German colleagues, he was \"a barbarian\".<ref name=\"pcern114\"/> In his polemic with Tzara, Breton also repeatedly placed stress on his rival's foreign origin.<ref>Cernat, p.114, 115; R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.35</ref>\n\nAt home, Tzara was occasionally targeted for his Jewishness, culminating in the ban enforced by the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime. In 1931, [[Const. I. Emilian]], the first Romanian to write an academic study on the avant-garde, attacked him from a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] position. He depicted Dadaists as \"[[Jewish Bolshevism|Judaeo-Bolsheviks]]\" who corrupted [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], and included Tzara among the main proponents of \"literary anarchism\".<ref>Cernat, p.296, 299, 307, 309-310, 329</ref> Alleging that Tzara's only merit was to establish a literary fashion, while recognizing his \"formal virtuosity and artistic intelligence\", he claimed to prefer Tzara in his ''[[Simbolul]]'' stage.<ref>Cernat, p.310</ref> This perspective was deplored early on by the modernist critic [[Perpessicius]].<ref>Cernat, p.329</ref> Nine years after Emilian's polemic text, [[Fascism|fascist]] poet and journalist [[Radu Gyr]] published an article in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', in which he attacked Tzara as a representative of the \"[[Judaism|Judaic]] spirit\", of the \"foreign plague\" and of \"[[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]-[[Historical materialism|historical dialectics]]\".<ref>[[Z.

Thus, he argues, the poet did not cultivate a memory of historical events, \"since it deludes man into thinking that there was something when there was nothing.\"<ref name=\"pbeit29\">Beitchman, p.29</ref> Cernat notes: \"That which essentially unifies, during [the 1910s], the poetic output of Adrian Maniu, Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara is an acute awareness of literary conventions, a satiety [...] in respect to [[Aestheticism|calophile]] literature, which they perceived as exhausted.\"<ref>Cernat, p.54</ref> In Beitchman's view, the revolt against cultivated beauty was a constant in Tzara's years of maturity, and his visions of social change continued to be inspired by [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and the [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]].<ref>Beitchman, p.38-39, 46</ref> According to Beitchman, Tzara uses the Symbolist message, \"the birthright [of humans] has been sold for a mess of porridge\", taking it \"into the streets, cabarets and trains where he denounces the deal and asks for his birthright back.\"<ref>Beitchman, p.52</ref>\n\n===Collaboration with Vinea===\nThe transition to a more radical form of poetry seems to have taken place in 1913\u20131915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).<ref>Cernat, p.117, 119</ref>\n\nIn addition to the lyrics were they both speak of provincial holidays and love affairs with local girls, both friends intended to reinterpret [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' from a modernist perspective, and wrote incomplete texts with this as their subject.<ref>Cernat, p.109, 119, 160</ref> However, Paul Cernat notes, the texts also evidence a difference in approach, with Vinea's work being \"meditative and melancholic\", while Tzara's is \"[[Hedonism|hedonistic]]\".<ref name=\"pcern117\">Cernat, p.117</ref> Tzara often appealed to revolutionary and ironic images, portraying provincial and [[middle class]] environments as places of artificiality and decay, demystifying [[pastoral]] themes and evidencing a will to break free.<ref>Cernat, p.117-119</ref> His literature took a more radical perspective on life, and featured lyrics with subversive intent:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|s\u0103 ne cobor\u00e2m \u00een r\u00e2pa, \ncare-i Dumnezeu c\u00e2nd

Often dressed up as [[German Tyrol|Tyrolian]] peasants or wearing dark robes, they improvised poetry sessions at the Cabaret Voltaire, reciting the works of others or their spontaneous creations, which were or pretended to be in [[Esperanto]] or [[M\u0101ori language]].<ref>Cernat, p.113, 115</ref> Bernard Gendron describes these soir\u00e9es as marked by \"heterogeneity and [[eclecticism]]\",<ref>Gendron, p.73</ref> and Richter notes that the songs, often punctuated by loud shrieks or other unsettling sounds, built on the legacy of [[noise music]] and [[Futurism (music)|Futurist compositions]].<ref>Richter, p.19</ref>\n\nWith time, Tristan Tzara merged his performances and his literature, taking part in developing Dada's \"simultaneist poetry\", which was meant to be read out loud and involved a collaborative effort, being, according to [[Hans Arp]], the first instance of [[Surrealist automatism]].<ref name=\"hrich16\"/> Ball stated that the subject of such pieces was \"the value of the human voice.\"<ref>Richter, p.31</ref> Together with Arp, Tzara and [[Walter Serner]] produced the [[German language|German-language]] ''Die Hyperbel vom Krokodilcoiffeur und dem Spazierstock'' (\"The Hyperbole of the Crocodile's Hairdresser and the Walking-Stick\"), in which, Arp stated, \"the poet crows, curses, sighs, stutters, [[Yodeling|yodels]], as he pleases.

Created with what Enoch Brater calls a \"peculiar verbal strategy\", it is a dialogue between characters called Ear, Mouth, Eye, Nose, Neck, and Eyebrow.<ref name=\"ebra25\">Brater, p.25</ref> They seem unwilling to actually communicate to each other and their reliance on proverbs and idiotisms willingly creates confusion between metaphorical and literal speech.<ref name=\"ebra25\"/> The play ends with a dance performance that recalls similar devices used by the proto-Dadaist [[Alfred Jarry]]. The text culminates in a series of doodles and illegible words.<ref name=\"ebra26\">Brater, p.26</ref> Brater describes ''The Gas Heart'' as a \"parod[y] of theatrical conventions\".<ref name=\"ebra26\"/>\n\nIn his 1924 play ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'', Tzara explores the relation between perception, the [[subconscious]] and memory. Largely through exchanges between commentators who act as third parties, the text presents the tribulations of a [[love triangle]] (a poet, a bored woman, and her banker husband, whose character traits borrow the clich\u00e9s of conventional drama), and in part reproduces settings and lines from ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref>Beitchman, p.31-32</ref> Tzara mocks classical theater, which demands from characters to be inspiring, believable, and to function as a whole: ''Handkerchief of Clouds'' requires actors in the role of commentators to address each other by their real names,<ref>Beitchman, p.32-34; Cernat, p.279</ref> and their lines include dismissive comments on the play itself, while the [[protagonist]], who in the end dies, is not assigned any name.<ref>Beitchman, p.32-34</ref> Writing for ''Integral'', Tzara defined his play as a note on \"the relativity of things, sentiments and events.\"<ref>Cernat, p.279</ref> Among the conventions ridiculed by the dramatist, Philip Beitchman notes, is that of a \"privileged position for art\": in what Beitchman sees as a comment on [[Marxism]], poet and banker are interchangeable [[Capitalism|capitalists]] who invest in different fields.<ref>Beitchman, p.34-35</ref> Writing in 1925, Fondane rendered a pronouncement by [[Jean Cocteau]], who, while commenting that Tzara was one of his \"most beloved\" writers and a \"great poet\", argued: \"''Handkerchief of Clouds'' was poetry, and great poetry for that matter\u2014but not theater.\"<ref>R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.34</ref> The work was nonetheless praised by [[Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru]] at ''Integral'', who saw in it one example that modernist performance could rely not just on props, but also on a solid text.<ref name=\"pcern277\"/>\n\n===''The Approximate Man'' and later works===\nAfter 1929, with the adoption of Surrealism, Tzara's literary works discard much of their satirical purpose, and begin to explore universal themes relating to the [[human condition]].<ref name=\"enotestt\"/> According to Cardinal, the period also signified the definitive move from \"a studied inconsequentiality\" and \"unreadable gibberish\" to \"a seductive and fertile surrealist idiom.\"<ref name=\"rcard530\"/> The critic also remarks: \"Tzara arrived at a mature style of transparent simplicity, in which disparate entities could be held together in a unifying vision.\"<ref name=\"rcard530\"/> In a 1930 essay, Fondane had given a similar verdict: arguing that Tzara had infused his work with \"suffering\", had discovered humanity, and had become a \"[[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]]\" among poets.<ref>R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.65</ref>\n\nThis period in Tzara's creative activity centers on ''[[The Approximate Man]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] which is reportedly recognized as his most accomplished contribution to [[French literature]].<ref name=\"rcard530\"/><ref name=\"enotestt\"/> While maintaining some of Tzara's preoccupation with language experimentation, it is mainly a study in [[social alienation]] and the search for an escape.<ref name=\"enotestt\"/><ref>Beitchman, p.37-42</ref> Cardinal calls the piece \"an extended meditation on mental and elemental impulses [...] with images of stunning beauty\",<ref name=\"rcard530\"/> while Breitchman, who notes Tzara's rebellion against the \"excess baggage of [man's] past and the notions [...] with which he has hitherto tried to control his life\", remarks his portrayal of poets as voices who can prevent human beings from destroying themselves with their own intellects.<ref>Beitchman, p.37-38</ref> The goal is a new man who lets intuition and spontaneity guide him through life, and who rejects measure.<ref>Beitchman, p.40-45</ref> One of the appeals in the text reads:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|fr|je parle de qui parle qui parle je suis seul\nje ne suis qu'un petit bruit j'ai plusieurs bruits en moi\nun bruit glac\u00e9 froiss\u00e9 au carrefour jet\u00e9 sur le trottoir humide\naux pieds des hommes press\u00e9s courant avec leurs morts\nautour de la mort qui \u00e9tend ses bras\nsur le cadran de l'heure seule vivante au soleil.}}<ref name=\"jycmelusine\"/>\n|\nI speak of the one who speaks who speaks I am alone\nI am but a small noise I have several noises in me\na ruffled noise frozen with the crossroads thrown on the wet pavement\nwith the feet of the men in a hurry running with their dead\naround death which extends its arms\non the dial of the hour only alive in the sun}}\n\nThe next stage in Tzara's career saw a merger of his literary and political views. His poems of the period blend a [[Humanism|humanist]] vision with [[Communism|communist]] theses.<ref name=\"enotestt\"/><ref name=\"pbeit49\"/> The 1935 ''Grains et issues'', described by Beitchman as \"fascinating\",<ref>Beitchman, p.45</ref> was a prose poem of [[social criticism]] connected with ''The Approximate Man'', expanding on the vision of a possible society, in which haste has been abandoned in favor of [[oblivion (eternal)|oblivion]]. The world imagined by Tzara abandons symbols of the past, from literature to public transportation and currency, while, like psychologists [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], the poet depicts violence as a natural means of human expression.<ref>Beitchman, p.46-50</ref> People of the future live in a state which combines waking life and the realm of dreams, and life itself turns into revery.<ref>Beitchman, p.48</ref> ''Grains et issues'' was accompanied by ''Personage d'insomnie'' (\"Personage of Insomnia\"), which went unpublished.<ref>Beitchman, p.51</ref>\n\nCardinal notes: \"In retrospect, harmony and contact had been Tzara's goals all along.\"<ref name=\"rcard530\"/> The post-[[World War II]] volumes in the series focus on political subjects related to the conflict.<ref name=\"enotestt\"/> In his last writings, Tzara toned down experimentation, exercising more control over the lyrical aspects.<ref name=\"enotestt\"/> He was by then undertaking a [[Hermeneutics|hermeutic]] research into the work of [[Goliard]]s and [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]], whom he deeply admired.<ref name=\"spbuot\"/><ref name=\"mrnnradi\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Influence===\nBeside the many authors who were attracted into Dada through his promotional activities, Tzara was able to influence successive generations of writers.

The controversy regarding Tzara's role as a founder of Dada extended into several milieus, and continued long after the writer died. Richter, who discusses the lengthy conflict between Huelsenbeck and Tzara over the issue of Dada foundation, speaks of the movement as being torn apart by \"petty jealousies\".<ref name=\"hrich32\"/> In Romania, similar debates often involved the supposed founding role of [[Urmuz]], who wrote his avant-garde texts before [[World War I]], and Tzara's status as a communicator between Romania and the rest of Europe. Vinea, who claimed that Dada had been invented by Tzara in [[G\u00e2rceni]] ca. 1915 and thus sought to legitimize his own modernist vision, also saw Urmuz as the ignored precursor of radical modernism, from Dada to Surrealism.<ref>Cernat, p.121-122, 128-129, 177, 212, 343, 346, 359, 409</ref> In 1931 the young, modernist literary critic [[Lucian Boz]] evidenced that he partly shared Vinea's perspective on the matter, crediting Tzara and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]] with having, each on his own, invented the avant-garde.<ref>Cernat, p.331</ref> [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] argued that \"before Dadaism there was Urmuzianism\", and, after [[World War II]], sought to popularize Urmuz's work among aficionados of Dada.<ref>Cernat, p.367</ref> Rumors in the literary community had it that Tzara successfully sabotaged Ionesco's initiative to publish a French edition of Urmuz's texts, allegedly because the public could then question his claim to have initiated the avant-garde experiment in Romania and the world (the edition saw print in 1965, two years after Tzara's death).<ref>Cernat, p.110, 367-368</ref>\n\nA more radical questioning of Tzara's influence came from Romanian essayist [[Petre Pandrea]]. In his personal diary, published long after he and Tzara had died, Pandrea depicted the poet as an opportunist, accusing him of adapting his style to political requirements, of dodging military service during [[World War I]], and of being a \"[[Lumpenproletariat|Lumpenproletarian]]\".<ref name=\"pcern113\">Cernat, p.113</ref> Pandrea's text, completed just after Tzara's visit to Romania, claimed that his founding role within the avant-garde was an \"illusion [...] which has swelled up like a multicolored balloon\", and denounced him as \"the [[Balkans|Balkan]] provider of interlope [[odalisque]]s, [together] with narcotics and a sort of scandalous literature.\"<ref name=\"pcern113\"/> Himself an adherent to communism, Pandrea grew disillusioned with the ideology, and later became a [[political prisoner]] in [[Communist Romania]]. Vinea's own grudge probably shows up in his 1964 novel ''Lunatecii'', where Tzara is identifiable as \"Dr. Barbu\", a thick-hided charlatan.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Sanda Cordo\u0219, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Lunatecii-un-mare-roman-de-redescoperit*articleID_28954-articles_details.html \"''Lunatecii'' \u2013 un mare roman de redescoperit\"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 683, July 2013</ref>\n\nFrom the 1960s to 1989, after a period when it ignored or attacked the avant-garde movement, the Romanian communist regime sought to recuperate Tzara, in order to validate its newly adopted emphasis on nationalist and [[National communism|national communist]] tenets. In 1977, literary historian [[Edgar Papu]], whose controversial theories were linked to \"[[protochronism]]\", which presumes that Romanians took precedence in various areas of world culture, mentioned Tzara, Urmuz, Ionesco and Isou as representatives of \"Romanian initiatives\" and \"road openers at a universal level.\"<ref>Cernat, p.359</ref> Elements of protochronism in this area, Paul Cernat argues, could be traced back to Vinea's claim that his friend had single-handedly created the worldwide avant-garde movement on the basis of models already present at home.<ref>Cernat, p.129</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Alice Armstrong, \"Stein, Gertrude\" and Roger Cardinal, \"Tzara, Tristan\", in [[Justin Wintle]] (ed.), ''Makers of Modern Culture'', [[Routledge]], London, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-26583-5}}\n*Philip Beitchman, \"Symbolism in the Streets\", in ''I Am a Process with No Subject'', [[University Press of Florida|University of Florida Press]], Gainesville, 1988. {{ISBN|0-8130-0888-3}}\n*Enoch Brater, ''Beyond Minimalism: Beckett's Late Style in the Theater'', [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, 1987. {{ISBN|0-19-506655-3}}\n*[[Paul Cernat]], ''Avangarda rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 \u0219i complexul periferiei: primul val'', [[Cartea Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]], Bucharest, 2007. {{ISBN|978-973-23-1911-6}}\n*Bernard Gendron, ''Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago, 2002. {{ISBN|0-226-28735-1}}\n*Saime G\u00f6ksu, Edward Timms, ''Romantic Communist: The Life and Work of Naz\u0131m Hikmet'', [[C.

There, Tzara's shows at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Z\u00fcrich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and [[Z\u00fcnfte of Z\u00fcrich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]], as well as his poetry and [[art manifesto]]s, became a main feature of early Dadaism. His work represented Dada's [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] side, in contrast with the more moderate approach favored by [[Hugo Ball]].\n\nAfter moving to Paris in 1919, Tzara, by then one of the \"presidents of Dada\", joined the staff of ''[[Litt\u00e9rature]]'' magazine, which marked the first step in the movement's evolution toward [[Surrealism]]. He was involved in the major polemics which led to Dada's split, defending his principles against [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] and [[Francis Picabia]], and, in Romania, against the [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] [[modernism]] of Vinea and Janco. This personal vision on art defined his Dadaist plays ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' (1921) and ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'' (1924). A forerunner of [[Surrealist automatism|automatist techniques]], Tzara eventually aligned himself with Breton's Surrealism, and under its influence wrote his celebrated [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian poem]] ''[[The Approximate Man]]''.\n\nDuring the final part of his career, Tzara combined his [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] perspective with a [[Communism|communist]] vision, joining the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]], and serving a term in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. Having spoken in favor of [[liberalization]] in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] just before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]], he distanced himself from the [[French Communist Party]], of which he was by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the [[Algerian War]].\n\nTristan Tzara was an influential author and performer, whose contribution is credited with having created a connection from [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] to the [[Beat Generation]], [[Situationist International|Situationism]] and various currents in [[rock music]]. The friend and collaborator of many modernist figures, he was the lover of dancer [[Maja Kruscek]] in his early youth and was later married to Swedish artist and poet [[Greta Knutson]].\n\n==Name==\n''S.

The story of its establishment was the subject of a disagreement between Tzara and his fellow writers. Cernat believes that the first Dadaist performance took place as early as February, when the nineteen-year-old Tzara, wearing a [[monocle]], entered the Cabaret Voltaire stage singing sentimental melodies and handing paper wads to his \"scandalized spectators\", leaving the stage to allow room for masked actors on [[stilts]], and returning in clown attire.<ref name=\"pcern112\">Cernat, p.112</ref> The same type of performances took place at the [[Z\u00fcnfte of Z\u00fcrich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]] beginning in summer 1916, after the Cabaret Voltaire was forced to close down.<ref>Cernat, p.115; Gendron, p.73-75; Hofman, p.3; Richter, p.39, 41-44, 48</ref> According to music historian Bernard Gendron, for as long as it lasted, \"the Cabaret Voltaire was dada. There was no alternative institution or site that could disentangle 'pure' dada from its mere accompaniment [...] nor was any such site desired.\"<ref>Gendron, p.75</ref> Other opinions link Dada's beginnings with much earlier events, including the experiments of [[Alfred Jarry]], [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], [[Christian Morgenstern]], [[Jean-Pierre Brisset]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Jacques Vach\u00e9]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] or [[Francis Picabia]].<ref>Richter, p.11, 71-72, 81-100, 168-173</ref>\n\nIn the first of the movement's manifestos, Ball wrote: \"[The booklet] is intended to present to the Public the activities and interests of the Cabaret Voltaire, which has as its sole purpose to draw attention, across the barriers of war and nationalism, to the few independent spirits who live for other ideals. The next objective of the artists who are assembled here is to publish a ''revue internationale'' [French for \"international magazine\"].\"<ref name=\"hrich14\">Richter, p.14</ref> Ball completed his message in French, and the paragraph translates as: \"The magazine shall be published in Z\u00fcrich and shall carry the name 'Dada' ('Dada').

According to Hans Richter, it included, alongside Tzara himself, figures ranging from Ernst, Arp, Baader, Breton and Aragon to Kruscek, Evola, [[Rafael Lasso de la Vega]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Vicente Huidobro]], [[Francesco Meriano]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Fraenkel]].<ref>Richter, p.201</ref> Richter notes: \"I'm not sure if all the names who appear here would agree with the description.\"<ref>Richter, p.200-201</ref>\n\n===End of World War I===\nThe shows Tzara staged in Z\u00fcrich often turned into scandals or riots, and he was in permanent conflict with the [[Law enforcement in Switzerland|Swiss law enforcers]].<ref>Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.16, 19, 39</ref> Hans Richter speaks of a \"pleasure of letting fly at the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], which in Tristan Tzara took the form of coldly (or hotly) calculated insolence\" (''see [[\u00c9pater la bourgeoisie]]'').<ref>Richter, p.24</ref> In one instance, as part of a series of events in which Dadaists mocked established authors, Tzara and Arp falsely publicized that they were going to fight a [[duel]] in Rehalp, near Z\u00fcrich, and that they were going to have the popular novelist [[Jakob Christoph Heer]] for their witness.<ref>Richter, p.66-67</ref> Richter also reports that his Romanian colleague profited from Swiss neutrality to play the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and [[Central Powers]] against each other, obtaining art works and funds from both, making use of their need to stimulate their respective [[propaganda]] efforts.<ref>Richter, p.47-48</ref> While active as a promoter, Tzara also published his first volume of collected poetry, the 1918 ''Vingt-cinq po\u00e8mes'' (\"Twenty-five Poems\").<ref name=\"rcard530\">Cardinal, p.530</ref>\n\nA major event took place in autumn 1918, when [[Francis Picabia]], who was then publisher of ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]'' magazine and a distant Dada affiliate, visited Z\u00fcrich and introduced his colleagues there to his [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] views on art and reason.<ref>Richter, p.70-74</ref> In the [[United States]], Picabia, [[Man Ray]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] had earlier set up their own version of Dada. This circle, based in New York City, sought affiliation with Tzara's only in 1921, when they jokingly asked him to grant them permission to use \"Dada\" as their own name (to which Tzara replied: \"Dada belongs to everybody\").<ref>Hofman, p.12</ref> The visit was credited by Richter with boosting the Romanian author's status, but also with making Tzara himself \"switch suddenly from a position of balance between art and [[anti-art]] into the [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] regions of pure and joyful nothingness.\"<ref>Richter, p.71</ref> The movement subsequently organized its last major Swiss show, held at the Saal zur Kaufleutern, with choreography by [[Susanne Perrottet]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], and with the participation of [[K\u00e4the Wulff]], [[Hans Heusser]], Tzara, Hans Richter and [[Walter Serner]].<ref>Richter, p.74-78</ref> It was there that Serner read from his 1918 essay, whose very title advocated ''Letzte Lockerung'' (\"Final Dissolution\"): this part is believed to have caused the subsequent m\u00eal\u00e9e, during which the public attacked the performers and succeeded in interrupting, but not canceling, the show.<ref>Richter, p.78-80</ref>\n\nFollowing the November 1918 [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice with Germany]], Dada's evolution was marked by political developments. In October 1919, Tzara, Arp and [[Otto Flake]] began publishing ''[[Der Zeltweg]]'', a journal aimed at further popularizing Dada in a post-war world were the borders were again accessible.<ref name=\"Richter, p.80\">Richter, p.80</ref> Richter, who admits that the magazine was \"rather tame\", also notes that Tzara and his colleagues were dealing with the impact of [[communist revolution]]s, in particular the [[October Revolution]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|German revolts of 1918]], which \"had stirred men's minds, divided men's interests and diverted energies in the direction of political change.\"<ref name=\"Richter, p.80\"/> The same commentator however dismisses those accounts which, he believes, led readers to believe that ''Der Zeltweg'' was \"an association of revolutionary artists.\"<ref name=\"Richter, p.80\"/> According to one account rendered by historian Robert Levy, Tzara shared company with a group of Romanian [[Communism|communist]] students, and, as such, may have met with [[Ana Pauker]], who was later one of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s most prominent activists.<ref>Robert Levy, ''Ana Pauker: The Rise and Fall of a Jewish Communist'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, p.37. {{ISBN|0-520-22395-0}}</ref>\n\nArp and Janco drifted away from the movement ca. 1919, when they created the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]]-inspired workshop ''[[Das Neue Leben]]''.<ref name=\"pcern115\">Cernat, p.115</ref> In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea.

Paul Cernat notes that the association between Samyro and the Jancos, who were Jews, and their [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] colleagues, was one sign of a cultural dialogue, in which \"the openness of Romanian environments toward artistic modernity\" was stimulated by \"young emancipated Jewish writers.\"<ref>Cernat, p.34</ref> Salomon Schulman, a Swedish researcher of [[Yiddish literature]], argues that the combined influence of Yiddish folklore and [[Hasidic philosophy]] shaped European modernism in general and Tzara's style in particular,<ref>Cernat, p.35-36</ref> while American poet [[Andrei Codrescu]] speaks of Tzara as one in a [[Balkans|Balkan]] line of \"absurdist writing\", which also includes the Romanians [[Urmuz]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] and [[Emil Cioran]].<ref>Olson, p.40</ref> According to literary historian [[George C\u0103linescu]], Samyro's early poems deal with \"the voluptuousness over the strong scents of rural life, which is typical among Jews compressed into [[ghetto]]s.\"<ref name=\"gcal887\">C\u0103linescu, p.887</ref>\n\nTzara himself used elements alluding to his homeland in his early Dadaist performances. His collaboration with [[Maja Kruscek]] at [[Z\u00fcnfte of Z\u00fcrich|Zuntfhaus z\u00fcr Waag]] featured samples of [[African literature]], to which Tzara added Romanian-language fragments.<ref name=\"pcern115\"/> He is also known to have mixed elements of [[Romanian folklore]], and to have sung the native suburban [[romanza]] ''La moar\u0103 la H\u00e2r\u021ba'' (\"At the Mill in H\u00e2r\u021ba\") during at least one staging for Cabaret Voltaire.<ref>Cernat, p.182, 405</ref> Addressing the Romanian public in 1947, he claimed to have been captivated by \"the sweet language of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavian]] peasants\".<ref name=\"iliv246\"/>\n\nTzara nonetheless rebelled against his birthplace and upbringing. His earliest poems depict provincial Moldavia as a desolate and unsettling place. In Cernat's view, this imagery was in common use among Moldavian-born writers who also belonged to the avant-garde trend, notably [[Benjamin Fondane]] and [[George Bacovia]].<ref>Cernat, p.37-38</ref> Like in the cases of Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco and Fondane, Cernat proposes, Samyro sought self-exile to [[Western Europe]] as a \"modern, [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]]\" means of breaking with \"the peripheral condition\",<ref>Cernat, p.38</ref> which may also serve to explain the pun he selected for a pseudonym.<ref name=\"pcern110\"/> According to the same author, two important elements in this process were \"a maternal attachment and a break with paternal authority\", an \"[[Oedipus complex]]\" which he also argued was evident in the biographies of other Symbolist and avant-garde Romanian authors, from Urmuz to [[Mateiu Caragiale]].<ref>Cernat, p.18</ref> Unlike Vinea and the ''[[Contimporanul]]'' group, Cernat proposes, Tzara stood for radicalism and insurgency, which would also help explain their impossibility to communicate.<ref>Cernat, p.398, 403-405</ref> In particular, Cernat argues, the writer sought to emancipate himself from competing nationalisms, and addressed himself directly to the center of European culture, with [[Z\u00fcrich]] serving as a stage on his way to [[Paris]].<ref name=\"pcern115\"/> The 1916 ''Monsieur's Antipyrine's Manifesto'' featured a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] appeal: \"DADA remains within the framework of European weaknesses, it's still shit, but from now on we want to shit in different colors so as to adorn the zoo of art with all the flags of all the consulates.\"<ref name=\"pcern115\"/>\n\nWith time, Tristan Tzara came to be regarded by his Dada associates as an exotic character, whose attitudes were intrinsically linked with [[Eastern Europe]]. Early on, Ball referred to him and the Janco brothers as \"Orientals\".<ref name=\"pcern112\"/> [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]] believed him to be a fiery and impulsive figure, having little in common with his German collaborators.<ref>Cernat, p.112; Richter, p.18-20, 24, 36, 37, 59</ref> According to Cernat, Richter's perspective seems to indicate a vision of Tzara having a \"[[Italic peoples|Latin]]\" temperament.<ref name=\"pcern112\"/> This type of perception also had negative implications for Tzara, particularly after the 1922 split within Dada. In the 1940s, [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] alleged that his former colleague had always been separated from other Dadaists by his failure to appreciate the legacy of \"[[Humanism in Germany|German humanism]]\", and that, compared to his German colleagues, he was \"a barbarian\".<ref name=\"pcern114\"/> In his polemic with Tzara, Breton also repeatedly placed stress on his rival's foreign origin.<ref>Cernat, p.114, 115; R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.35</ref>\n\nAt home, Tzara was occasionally targeted for his Jewishness, culminating in the ban enforced by the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime. In 1931, [[Const. I. Emilian]], the first Romanian to write an academic study on the avant-garde, attacked him from a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] position.

Thus, he argues, the poet did not cultivate a memory of historical events, \"since it deludes man into thinking that there was something when there was nothing.\"<ref name=\"pbeit29\">Beitchman, p.29</ref> Cernat notes: \"That which essentially unifies, during [the 1910s], the poetic output of Adrian Maniu, Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara is an acute awareness of literary conventions, a satiety [...] in respect to [[Aestheticism|calophile]] literature, which they perceived as exhausted.\"<ref>Cernat, p.54</ref> In Beitchman's view, the revolt against cultivated beauty was a constant in Tzara's years of maturity, and his visions of social change continued to be inspired by [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and the [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]].<ref>Beitchman, p.38-39, 46</ref> According to Beitchman, Tzara uses the Symbolist message, \"the birthright [of humans] has been sold for a mess of porridge\", taking it \"into the streets, cabarets and trains where he denounces the deal and asks for his birthright back.\"<ref>Beitchman, p.52</ref>\n\n===Collaboration with Vinea===\nThe transition to a more radical form of poetry seems to have taken place in 1913\u20131915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).<ref>Cernat, p.117, 119</ref>\n\nIn addition to the lyrics were they both speak of provincial holidays and love affairs with local girls, both friends intended to reinterpret [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' from a modernist perspective, and wrote incomplete texts with this as their subject.<ref>Cernat, p.109, 119, 160</ref> However, Paul Cernat notes, the texts also evidence a difference in approach, with Vinea's work being \"meditative and melancholic\", while Tzara's is \"[[Hedonism|hedonistic]]\".<ref name=\"pcern117\">Cernat, p.117</ref> Tzara often appealed to revolutionary and ironic images, portraying provincial and [[middle class]] environments as places of artificiality and decay, demystifying [[pastoral]] themes and evidencing a will to break free.<ref>Cernat, p.117-119</ref> His literature took a more radical perspective on life, and featured lyrics with subversive intent:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|s\u0103 ne cobor\u00e2m \u00een r\u00e2pa, \ncare-i Dumnezeu c\u00e2nd

In contrast to his previous rejection of Dada, ''[[Contimporanul]]'' collaborator [[Benjamin Fondane]] used them as an example of \"pure poetry\", and compared them to the elaborate writings of French poet [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]], thus recuperating them in line with the magazine's ideology.<ref>Cernat, p.153, 288; R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.62-67</ref>\n\n===Dada synthesis and \"simultaneism\"===\nTzara the Dadaist was inspired by the contributions of his experimental modernist predecessors.

Often dressed up as [[German Tyrol|Tyrolian]] peasants or wearing dark robes, they improvised poetry sessions at the Cabaret Voltaire, reciting the works of others or their spontaneous creations, which were or pretended to be in [[Esperanto]] or [[M\u0101ori language]].<ref>Cernat, p.113, 115</ref> Bernard Gendron describes these soir\u00e9es as marked by \"heterogeneity and [[eclecticism]]\",<ref>Gendron, p.73</ref> and Richter notes that the songs, often punctuated by loud shrieks or other unsettling sounds, built on the legacy of [[noise music]] and [[Futurism (music)|Futurist compositions]].<ref>Richter, p.19</ref>\n\nWith time, Tristan Tzara merged his performances and his literature, taking part in developing Dada's \"simultaneist poetry\", which was meant to be read out loud and involved a collaborative effort, being, according to [[Hans Arp]], the first instance of [[Surrealist automatism]].<ref name=\"hrich16\"/> Ball stated that the subject of such pieces was \"the value of the human voice.\"<ref>Richter, p.31</ref> Together with Arp, Tzara and [[Walter Serner]] produced the [[German language|German-language]] ''Die Hyperbel vom Krokodilcoiffeur und dem Spazierstock'' (\"The Hyperbole of the Crocodile's Hairdresser and the Walking-Stick\"), in which, Arp stated, \"the poet crows, curses, sighs, stutters, [[Yodeling|yodels]], as he pleases. His poems are like Nature [where] a tiny particle is as beautiful and important as a star.\"<ref>Richter, p.30-31</ref> Another noted simultaneist poem was ''L'Amiral cherche une maison \u00e0 louer'' (\"The Admiral Is Looking for a House to Rent\"), co-authored by Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbach.<ref name=\"gcal887\"/>\n\nArt historian Roger Cardinal describes Tristan Tzara's Dada poetry as marked by \"extreme semantic and syntactic incoherence\".<ref name=\"rcard530\"/> Tzara, who recommended destroying just as it is created,<ref>Londr\u00e9, p.396-397</ref> had devised a personal system for writing poetry, which implied a seemingly chaotic reassembling of words that had been randomly cut out of newspapers.<ref name=\"nzgysin\"/><ref>C\u0103linescu, p.887; Londr\u00e9, p.397; Richter, p.54, 60, 123</ref><ref name=\"rlword\">Robin Lydenberg, ''Word Cultures: Radical Theory and Practice in William S.

Created with what Enoch Brater calls a \"peculiar verbal strategy\", it is a dialogue between characters called Ear, Mouth, Eye, Nose, Neck, and Eyebrow.<ref name=\"ebra25\">Brater, p.25</ref> They seem unwilling to actually communicate to each other and their reliance on proverbs and idiotisms willingly creates confusion between metaphorical and literal speech.<ref name=\"ebra25\"/> The play ends with a dance performance that recalls similar devices used by the proto-Dadaist [[Alfred Jarry]].

Largely through exchanges between commentators who act as third parties, the text presents the tribulations of a [[love triangle]] (a poet, a bored woman, and her banker husband, whose character traits borrow the clich\u00e9s of conventional drama), and in part reproduces settings and lines from ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref>Beitchman, p.31-32</ref> Tzara mocks classical theater, which demands from characters to be inspiring, believable, and to function as a whole: ''Handkerchief of Clouds'' requires actors in the role of commentators to address each other by their real names,<ref>Beitchman, p.32-34; Cernat, p.279</ref> and their lines include dismissive comments on the play itself, while the [[protagonist]], who in the end dies, is not assigned any name.<ref>Beitchman, p.32-34</ref> Writing for ''Integral'', Tzara defined his play as a note on \"the relativity of things, sentiments and events.\"<ref>Cernat, p.279</ref> Among the conventions ridiculed by the dramatist, Philip Beitchman notes, is that of a \"privileged position for art\": in what Beitchman sees as a comment on [[Marxism]], poet and banker are interchangeable [[Capitalism|capitalists]] who invest in different fields.<ref>Beitchman, p.34-35</ref> Writing in 1925, Fondane rendered a pronouncement by [[Jean Cocteau]], who, while commenting that Tzara was one of his \"most beloved\" writers and a \"great poet\", argued: \"''Handkerchief of Clouds'' was poetry, and great poetry for that matter\u2014but not theater.\"<ref>R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.34</ref> The work was nonetheless praised by [[Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru]] at ''Integral'', who saw in it one example that modernist performance could rely not just on props, but also on a solid text.<ref name=\"pcern277\"/>\n\n===''The Approximate Man'' and later works===\nAfter 1929, with the adoption of Surrealism, Tzara's literary works discard much of their satirical purpose, and begin to explore universal themes relating to the [[human condition]].<ref name=\"enotestt\"/> According to Cardinal, the period also signified the definitive move from \"a studied inconsequentiality\" and \"unreadable gibberish\" to \"a seductive and fertile surrealist idiom.\"<ref name=\"rcard530\"/> The critic also remarks: \"Tzara arrived at a mature style of transparent simplicity, in which disparate entities could be held together in a unifying vision.\"<ref name=\"rcard530\"/> In a 1930 essay, Fondane had given a similar verdict: arguing that Tzara had infused his work with \"suffering\", had discovered humanity, and had become a \"[[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]]\" among poets.<ref>R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.65</ref>\n\nThis period in Tzara's creative activity centers on ''[[The Approximate Man]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] which is reportedly recognized as his most accomplished contribution to [[French literature]].<ref name=\"rcard530\"/><ref name=\"enotestt\"/> While maintaining some of Tzara's preoccupation with language experimentation, it is mainly a study in [[social alienation]] and the search for an escape.<ref name=\"enotestt\"/><ref>Beitchman, p.37-42</ref> Cardinal calls the piece \"an extended meditation on mental and elemental impulses [...] with images of stunning beauty\",<ref name=\"rcard530\"/> while Breitchman, who notes Tzara's rebellion against the \"excess baggage of [man's] past and the notions [...] with which he has hitherto tried to control his life\", remarks his portrayal of poets as voices who can prevent human beings from destroying themselves with their own intellects.<ref>Beitchman, p.37-38</ref> The goal is a new man who lets intuition and spontaneity guide him through life, and who rejects measure.<ref>Beitchman, p.40-45</ref> One of the appeals in the text reads:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|fr|je parle de qui parle qui parle je suis seul\nje ne suis qu'un petit bruit j'ai plusieurs bruits en moi\nun bruit glac\u00e9 froiss\u00e9 au carrefour jet\u00e9 sur le trottoir humide\naux pieds des hommes press\u00e9s courant avec leurs morts\nautour de la mort qui \u00e9tend ses bras\nsur le cadran de l'heure seule vivante au soleil.}}<ref name=\"jycmelusine\"/>\n|\nI speak of the one who speaks who speaks I am alone\nI am but a small noise I have several noises in me\na ruffled noise frozen with the crossroads thrown on the wet pavement\nwith the feet of the men in a hurry running with their dead\naround death which extends its arms\non the dial of the hour only alive in the sun}}\n\nThe next stage in Tzara's career saw a merger of his literary and political views.

The controversy regarding Tzara's role as a founder of Dada extended into several milieus, and continued long after the writer died. Richter, who discusses the lengthy conflict between Huelsenbeck and Tzara over the issue of Dada foundation, speaks of the movement as being torn apart by \"petty jealousies\".<ref name=\"hrich32\"/> In Romania, similar debates often involved the supposed founding role of [[Urmuz]], who wrote his avant-garde texts before [[World War I]], and Tzara's status as a communicator between Romania and the rest of Europe. Vinea, who claimed that Dada had been invented by Tzara in [[G\u00e2rceni]] ca. 1915 and thus sought to legitimize his own modernist vision, also saw Urmuz as the ignored precursor of radical modernism, from Dada to Surrealism.<ref>Cernat, p.121-122, 128-129, 177, 212, 343, 346, 359, 409</ref> In 1931 the young, modernist literary critic [[Lucian Boz]] evidenced that he partly shared Vinea's perspective on the matter, crediting Tzara and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]] with having, each on his own, invented the avant-garde.<ref>Cernat, p.331</ref> [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] argued that \"before Dadaism there was Urmuzianism\", and, after [[World War II]], sought to popularize Urmuz's work among aficionados of Dada.<ref>Cernat, p.367</ref> Rumors in the literary community had it that Tzara successfully sabotaged Ionesco's initiative to publish a French edition of Urmuz's texts, allegedly because the public could then question his claim to have initiated the avant-garde experiment in Romania and the world (the edition saw print in 1965, two years after Tzara's death).<ref>Cernat, p.110, 367-368</ref>\n\nA more radical questioning of Tzara's influence came from Romanian essayist [[Petre Pandrea]]. In his personal diary, published long after he and Tzara had died, Pandrea depicted the poet as an opportunist, accusing him of adapting his style to political requirements, of dodging military service during [[World War I]], and of being a \"[[Lumpenproletariat|Lumpenproletarian]]\".<ref name=\"pcern113\">Cernat, p.113</ref> Pandrea's text, completed just after Tzara's visit to Romania, claimed that his founding role within the avant-garde was an \"illusion [...] which has swelled up like a multicolored balloon\", and denounced him as \"the [[Balkans|Balkan]] provider of interlope [[odalisque]]s, [together] with narcotics and a sort of scandalous literature.\"<ref name=\"pcern113\"/> Himself an adherent to communism, Pandrea grew disillusioned with the ideology, and later became a [[political prisoner]] in [[Communist Romania]]. Vinea's own grudge probably shows up in his 1964 novel ''Lunatecii'', where Tzara is identifiable as \"Dr. Barbu\", a thick-hided charlatan.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Sanda Cordo\u0219, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Lunatecii-un-mare-roman-de-redescoperit*articleID_28954-articles_details.html \"''Lunatecii'' \u2013 un mare roman de redescoperit\"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 683, July 2013</ref>\n\nFrom the 1960s to 1989, after a period when it ignored or attacked the avant-garde movement, the Romanian communist regime sought to recuperate Tzara, in order to validate its newly adopted emphasis on nationalist and [[National communism|national communist]] tenets. In 1977, literary historian [[Edgar Papu]], whose controversial theories were linked to \"[[protochronism]]\", which presumes that Romanians took precedence in various areas of world culture, mentioned Tzara, Urmuz, Ionesco and Isou as representatives of \"Romanian initiatives\" and \"road openers at a universal level.\"<ref>Cernat, p.359</ref> Elements of protochronism in this area, Paul Cernat argues, could be traced back to Vinea's claim that his friend had single-handedly created the worldwide avant-garde movement on the basis of models already present at home.<ref>Cernat, p.129</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Alice Armstrong, \"Stein, Gertrude\" and Roger Cardinal, \"Tzara, Tristan\", in [[Justin Wintle]] (ed.), ''Makers of Modern Culture'', [[Routledge]], London, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-26583-5}}\n*Philip Beitchman, \"Symbolism in the Streets\", in ''I Am a Process with No Subject'', [[University Press of Florida|University of Florida Press]], Gainesville, 1988. {{ISBN|0-8130-0888-3}}\n*Enoch Brater, ''Beyond Minimalism: Beckett's Late Style in the Theater'', [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, 1987. {{ISBN|0-19-506655-3}}\n*[[Paul Cernat]], ''Avangarda rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 \u0219i complexul periferiei: primul val'', [[Cartea Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]], Bucharest, 2007. {{ISBN|978-973-23-1911-6}}\n*Bernard Gendron, ''Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago, 2002. {{ISBN|0-226-28735-1}}\n*Saime G\u00f6ksu, Edward Timms, ''Romantic Communist: The Life and Work of Naz\u0131m Hikmet'', [[C.
