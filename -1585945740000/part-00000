It was released on September 6, 2019, by [[Elektra Records]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 2016, when Shires was finishing her record, ''My Piece of Land'', in music producer [[Dave Cobb]]'s studio, Shires had an idea to create a female country supergroup in homage to the legendary [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|Highwaymen]] (consisting of [[Johnny Cash]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Willie Nelson]]). At the same time, the lack of representation of female artists on country radio and at country music festivals had been publicly discussed by many journalists like Marissa Moss. While on tour in her van, Shires kept a running list of artists while listening to country radio, and noticed that there were very few women. When she called to request they play more female artists, she was directed to a Facebook page lottery system. Cobb recommended Shires call Carlile, who she didn't know. Carlile thought it would be fun, and would be an interesting creative project.<ref name=RollingStone-SiriusXM-2019>{{cite news|last1=Hudak|first1=Joseph|title=Brandi Carlile, Maren Morris Talk Highwomen Project|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/highwomen-brandi-carlile-maren-morris-amanda-shires-natalie-hemby-847032/|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|language=en-US|date=11 June 2019|format=Includes two-part audio interview on [[SiriusXM]]'s channel [[The Highway]] with [[Storme Warren]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Highwomen project was widely hinted at by Carlile, Morris and Shires before it was officially announced on April 6, 2019. The Highwomen had originally intended to leave the fourth spot in their line-up vacant to allow other female collaborators to join them, with [[Chely Wright]], [[Courtney Marie Andrews]], [[Margo Price]], [[Janelle Monae]], and [[Sheryl Crow]] mentioned as potential guests.<ref name=Variety-MarenMorris-JoinsGroup-2019>{{cite news|first1=Chris|last1=Willman|title=Brandi Carlile, Amanda Shires Add Maren Morris to \u2018Highwomen\u2019 Supergroup|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/brandi-carline-maren-morris-amanda-shires-highwomen-supergroup-1203156171/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=6 March 2019}}</ref> The band, who jokingly refer to the collaboration as a pirate ship experience, said that they see the project as an incubator project that highlights mentorship and support of fellow women artists.<ref name=RollingStone-SiriusXM-2019 />\n\nThe group made their live debut on April 1, 2019, at [[Loretta Lynn]]'s 87th birthday concert held at the [[Bridgestone Arena]] in [[Nashville]].

The song was re-written by band members [[Brandi Carlile]] and [[Amanda Shires]] with Webb's blessing. Together they created the story of the band in classic response-song style. The song tells the story of how women throughout history have often sacrificed themselves for something greater. The four women in the song are an immigrant, a healer, a freedom rider, and a preacher.<ref name=\"RS\">{{cite web |last1=Moss |first1=Marissa R. |title=The Highwomen\u2019s Debut Album: Track-by-Track Guide |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/the-highwomens-debut-album-track-by-track-guide-879785/ |website=Rolling Stone |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=September 7, 2019 |date=September 4, 2019}}</ref> It features guest vocals from [[Yola (singer)|Yola]] and background vocals from [[Sheryl Crow]]. The album's second track, and lead single, is \"Redesigning Women\". It was written by band member [[Natalie Hemby]] with [[Rodney Clawson]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said that the song \"puts a woman\u2019s experience front and center, with just enough punch to make it smart, self-deprecating, and sarcastic all at once.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> The third track, \"Loose Change\", written by band member [[Maren Morris]] with [[Maggie Chapman]] and [[Daniel Layus]] of the band [[Augustana (band)|Augustana]], is filled with clever wordplay and a heavy dose of Texas swagger.<ref name=\"RS\"/> \"Crowded Table\", the fourth track and second single, was written by band members Hemby and Carlile with [[Lori McKenna]]. ''Rolling Stone'' called the song the band's mission statement and said it's about \"looking for a world where everyone is given a chance to fit in. This isn\u2019t about leaning in or fighting for the top chair. It\u2019s about making room.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\nTrack five, \"My Name Can't Be Mama\" was written by Carlile, Morris, and Shires. An inclusive song about motherhood and parenting, it is equal parts funny and potent. The three women in the song all have their own definition of being a mother and each have their own reason for why they need a break. For Carlile, it's a hard morning after a night of no sleep; for Shires, it's trying to find a career; and for Morris, it's a break from society's expectation to have children by a certain age.<ref name=\"RS\"/> \"If She Ever Leaves Me\", the album's sixth track, was written by band member Amanda Shires with her husband Jason Isbell and Chris Thompkins. Isbell said that he came up with the idea while exercising and realized that if Carlile sang it they could have a singular \"gay country song\" moment.<ref name=\"RS\"/> ''Rolling Stone'' called it \"a love song that transcends sexuality while not ignoring it.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\nTrack seven, \"Old Soul\", penned by Morris with Luke Dick and Laura Veltz, is an intimate look at the burdens of having to grow up too fast.<ref name=\"RS\"/> The eighth track, \"Don't Call Me\", written by Shires and Peter Levin, is a reminder to not pick up the phone the next time an ex calls.<ref name=\"RS\"/> \"My Only Child\", the album's ninth track, was written by members Hemby and Shires with [[Miranda Lambert]]. It is about the love a mother has for her child and her disappointment that her family ended up smaller than she had once dreamed it would. The album's tenth track, \"Heaven Is a Honky Tonk\", was written by members Carlile and Hemby with Ray LaMontagne, and features Sheryl Crow and background vocals by Yola. Track eleven, \"Cocktail and a Song\", is a solo composition from Shires about mortality and life's inevitabilities.<ref name=\"RS\"/> The album closes with \"The Wheels of Laredo\", a song written by Carlile with Tim and Phil Hanseroth for [[Tanya Tucker]]'s 2019 album, ''[[While I'm Livin']]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 79/100<ref name=Metacritic-2019>{{cite web|title=The Highwomen by The Highwomen|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/the-highwomen/the-highwomen|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 7, 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=AllMusic-Review-2019>{{cite news|title=The Highwomen - The Highwomen: Songs, Reviews, Credits|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-highwomen-mw0003302220|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=September 6, 2019|language=en-us}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[American Songwriter]]''\n| rev2score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=AmericanSongwriter-Review-2019>{{cite news|last1=Horowitz|first1=Hal|title=The Highwomen: The Highwomen|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2019/09/the-highwomen-the-highwomen/|work=[[American Songwriter]]|date=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Consequence of Sound]]''\n| rev3score = B+<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thiessen |first1=Christopher |title=Album Review: The Highwomen Rally Against Industry Toxicity on Their Powerful Debut |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/09/album-review-the-highwomen-the-highwomen/ |website=Consequence of Sound |accessdate=September 10, 2019 |date=September 9, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Exclaim!]]''\n| rev4score = 8/10<ref name=Exclaim-Review-2019>{{cite news|last1=Stanley|first1=Laura|title=The Highwomen: The Highwomen|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/the_highwomen-the_highwomen|work=[[Exclaim!]]|date=September 3, 2019|language=en-ca}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev5score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=Guardian-Review-2019>{{cite news|last1=Hann|first1=Michael|title=The Highwomen: The Highwomen review \u2013 country supergroup shatter macho cliches|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/06/the-highwomen-the-highwomen-review|work=[[The Guardian]]|date= September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev6score = 7.7/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Currin|first=Grayson Haver|title=The Highwomen: The Highwomen Album Review|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-highwomen-the-highwomen/|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=September 18, 2019|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[PopMatters]]''\n| rev7score = {{Rating|7|10}}<ref name=PopMatters-Review-2019>{{cite web |last1=Conaton |first1=Chris |title=The Highwomen Is a Supergroup That Packs a Punch |url=https://www.popmatters.com/the-highwomen-review-2640163291.html?rebelltitem=4#rebelltitem4 |website=PopMatters |accessdate=September 8, 2019 |language=en |date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=RollilngStone-Review-2019>{{cite news|last1=Hermes|first1=Will|title=The Highwomen Write Their Own History on Superb Debut Album|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/the-highwomen-album-review-878243/|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 29, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Slant Magazine]]''\n| rev9score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=Slant-Review-2019>{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Seth|title=Review: The Highwomen\u2019s Debut Subverts Tradition to Deliver Its Feminist Message|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review-the-highwomen-debut-subverts-tradition-to-deliver-its-feminist-message/|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Us Weekly]]''\n| rev10score = {{Rating|4|4}}<ref name=USWeekly-Review-2019>{{cite news|last1=Hautman|first1=Nicholas|title=The Highwomen Are \u2018Resilient\u2019 on \u2018Chill-Inducing\u2019 Debut Album: Review|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/the-highwomen-album-review-supergroups-debut-is-chill-inducing/|work=[[Us Weekly]]|date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe album received mostly positive reviews from music critics.

Highwomen''''' is the eponymous debut studio album by [[country music]] [[Musical supergroup|supergroup]] [[the Highwomen]], made up of band members [[Brandi Carlile]], [[Natalie Hemby]], [[Maren Morris]], and [[Amanda Shires]]. It was released on September 6, 2019, by [[Elektra Records]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 2016, when Shires was finishing her record, ''My Piece of Land'', in music producer [[Dave Cobb]]'s studio, Shires had an idea to create a female country supergroup in homage to the legendary [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|Highwaymen]] (consisting of [[Johnny Cash]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Willie Nelson]]). At the same time, the lack of representation of female artists on country radio and at country music festivals had been publicly discussed by many journalists like Marissa Moss. While on tour in her van, Shires kept a running list of artists while listening to country radio, and noticed that there were very few women. When she called to request they play more female artists, she was directed to a Facebook page lottery system. Cobb recommended Shires call Carlile, who she didn't know. Carlile thought it would be fun, and would be an interesting creative project.<ref name=RollingStone-SiriusXM-2019>{{cite news|last1=Hudak|first1=Joseph|title=Brandi Carlile, Maren Morris Talk Highwomen Project|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/highwomen-brandi-carlile-maren-morris-amanda-shires-natalie-hemby-847032/|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|language=en-US|date=11 June 2019|format=Includes two-part audio interview on [[SiriusXM]]'s channel [[The Highway]] with [[Storme Warren]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Highwomen project was widely hinted at by Carlile, Morris and Shires before it was officially announced on April 6, 2019. The Highwomen had originally intended to leave the fourth spot in their line-up vacant to allow other female collaborators to join them, with [[Chely Wright]], [[Courtney Marie Andrews]], [[Margo Price]], [[Janelle Monae]], and [[Sheryl Crow]] mentioned as potential guests.<ref name=Variety-MarenMorris-JoinsGroup-2019>{{cite news|first1=Chris|last1=Willman|title=Brandi Carlile, Amanda Shires Add Maren Morris to \u2018Highwomen\u2019 Supergroup|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/brandi-carline-maren-morris-amanda-shires-highwomen-supergroup-1203156171/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=6 March 2019}}</ref> The band, who jokingly refer to the collaboration as a pirate ship experience, said that they see the project as an incubator project that highlights mentorship and support of fellow women artists.<ref name=RollingStone-SiriusXM-2019 />\n\nThe group made their live debut on April 1, 2019, at [[Loretta Lynn]]'s 87th birthday concert held at the [[Bridgestone Arena]] in [[Nashville]].

The song was re-written by band members [[Brandi Carlile]] and [[Amanda Shires]] with Webb's blessing. Together they created the story of the band in classic response-song style. The song tells the story of how women throughout history have often sacrificed themselves for something greater. The four women in the song are an immigrant, a healer, a freedom rider, and a preacher.<ref name=\"RS\">{{cite web |last1=Moss |first1=Marissa R. |title=The Highwomen\u2019s Debut Album: Track-by-Track Guide |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/the-highwomens-debut-album-track-by-track-guide-879785/ |website=Rolling Stone |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=September 7, 2019 |date=September 4, 2019}}</ref> It features guest vocals from [[Yola (singer)|Yola]] and background vocals from [[Sheryl Crow]]. The album's second track, and lead single, is \"Redesigning Women\". It was written by band member [[Natalie Hemby]] with [[Rodney Clawson]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said that the song \"puts a woman\u2019s experience front and center, with just enough punch to make it smart, self-deprecating, and sarcastic all at once.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> The third track, \"Loose Change\", written by band member [[Maren Morris]] with [[Maggie Chapman]] and [[Daniel Layus]] of the band [[Augustana (band)|Augustana]], is filled with clever wordplay and a heavy dose of Texas swagger.<ref name=\"RS\"/> \"Crowded Table\", the fourth track and second single, was written by band members Hemby and Carlile with [[Lori McKenna]]. ''Rolling Stone'' called the song the band's mission statement and said it's about \"looking for a world where everyone is given a chance to fit in. This isn\u2019t about leaning in or fighting for the top chair. It\u2019s about making room.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\nTrack five, \"My Name Can't Be Mama\" was written by Carlile, Morris, and Shires. An inclusive song about motherhood and parenting, it is equal parts funny and potent. The three women in the song all have their own definition of being a mother and each have their own reason for why they need a break. For Carlile, it\u2019s a hard morning after a night of no sleep; for Shires, it\u2019s trying to find a career; and for Morris, it's a break from society\u2019s expectation to have children by a certain age.<ref name=\"RS\"/> \"If She Ever Leaves Me\", the album's sixth track, was written by band member Amanda Shires with her husband Jason Isbell and Chris Thompkins. Isbell said that he came up with the idea while exercising and realized that if Carlile sang it they could have a singular \"gay country song\" moment.<ref name=\"RS\"/> ''Rolling Stone'' called it \"a love song that transcends sexuality while not ignoring it.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\nTrack seven, \"Old Soul\", penned by Morris with Luke Dick and Laura Veltz, is an intimate look at the burdens of having to grow up too fast.<ref name=\"RS\"/> The eighth track, \"Don't Call Me\", written by Shires and Peter Levin, is a reminder to not pick up the phone the next time an ex calls.<ref name=\"RS\"/> \"My Only Child\", the album's ninth track, was written by members Hemby and Shires with [[Miranda Lambert]]. It is about the love a mother has for her child and her disappointment that her family ended up smaller than she had once dreamed it would. The album's tenth track, \"Heaven Is a Honky Tonk\", was written by members Carlile and Hemby with Ray LaMontagne, and features Sheryl Crow and background vocals by Yola. Track eleven, \"Cocktail and a Song\", is a solo composition from Shires about mortality and life\u2019s inevitabilities.<ref name=\"RS\"/> The album closes with \"The Wheels of Laredo\", a song written by Carlile with Tim and Phil Hanseroth for [[Tanya Tucker]]'s 2019 album, ''[[While I'm Livin']]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 79/100<ref name=Metacritic-2019>{{cite web|title=The Highwomen by The Highwomen|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/the-highwomen/the-highwomen|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 7, 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=AllMusic-Review-2019>{{cite news|title=The Highwomen - The Highwomen: Songs, Reviews, Credits|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-highwomen-mw0003302220|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=September 6, 2019|language=en-us}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[American Songwriter]]''\n| rev2score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=AmericanSongwriter-Review-2019>{{cite news|last1=Horowitz|first1=Hal|title=The Highwomen: The Highwomen|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2019/09/the-highwomen-the-highwomen/|work=[[American Songwriter]]|date=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Consequence of Sound]]''\n| rev3score = B+<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thiessen |first1=Christopher |title=Album Review: The Highwomen Rally Against Industry Toxicity on Their Powerful Debut |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/09/album-review-the-highwomen-the-highwomen/ |website=Consequence of Sound |accessdate=September 10, 2019 |date=September 9, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Exclaim!]]''\n| rev4score = 8/10<ref name=Exclaim-Review-2019>{{cite news|last1=Stanley|first1=Laura|title=The Highwomen: The Highwomen|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/the_highwomen-the_highwomen|work=[[Exclaim!]]|date=September 3, 2019|language=en-ca}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev5score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=Guardian-Review-2019>{{cite news|last1=Hann|first1=Michael|title=The Highwomen: The Highwomen review \u2013 country supergroup shatter macho cliches|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/06/the-highwomen-the-highwomen-review|work=[[The Guardian]]|date= September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev6score = 7.7/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Currin|first=Grayson Haver|title=The Highwomen: The Highwomen Album Review|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-highwomen-the-highwomen/|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=September 18, 2019|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[PopMatters]]''\n| rev7score = {{Rating|7|10}}<ref name=PopMatters-Review-2019>{{cite web |last1=Conaton |first1=Chris |title=The Highwomen Is a Supergroup That Packs a Punch |url=https://www.popmatters.com/the-highwomen-review-2640163291.html?rebelltitem=4#rebelltitem4 |website=PopMatters |accessdate=September 8, 2019 |language=en |date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=RollilngStone-Review-2019>{{cite news|last1=Hermes|first1=Will|title=The Highwomen Write Their Own History on Superb Debut Album|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/the-highwomen-album-review-878243/|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 29, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Slant Magazine]]''\n| rev9score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=Slant-Review-2019>{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Seth|title=Review: The Highwomen\u2019s Debut Subverts Tradition to Deliver Its Feminist Message|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review-the-highwomen-debut-subverts-tradition-to-deliver-its-feminist-message/|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Us Weekly]]''\n| rev10score = {{Rating|4|4}}<ref name=USWeekly-Review-2019>{{cite news|last1=Hautman|first1=Nicholas|title=The Highwomen Are \u2018Resilient\u2019 on \u2018Chill-Inducing\u2019 Debut Album: Review|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/the-highwomen-album-review-supergroups-debut-is-chill-inducing/|work=[[Us Weekly]]|date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe album received mostly positive reviews from music critics.

{"title_page": "Derbyite theory of Shakespeare authorship", "text_new": "[[File:6thEarlOfDerby.jpg|thumb|William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]]\nThe '''Derbyite theory of Shakespeare authorship''' is the view that [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]] (1561\u20131642), was the true author of the works of [[William Shakespeare]]. Derby is one of several individuals who have been claimed by advocates of the [[Shakespeare authorship question]] to be the true author of Shakespeare's works.\n\nThe theory was first proposed in 1891, and was taken up predominantly by French writers in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nHello how are you? Mainstream scholarship dismisses all alternative candidates for authorship of the works, but accepts that Shakespeare sometimes [[William Shakespeare's collaborations|worked in collaborations]] with other professional playwrights such as [[George Peele]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]. Some mainstream writers have taken the view that Derby may have had links to Shakespeare. Some of the Derbyite arguments about ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' have also been integrated into mainstream scholarship.<ref name = \"lon\">[[Felicia Hardison Londr\u00e9]] (ed), ''Love's labour's lost: critical essays'', Routledge, 1997, pp. 84ff, 327.</ref>\n\n==Greenstreet==\nDerby's candidacy was first raised as a possibility in 1891 by the archivist James H. Greenstreet, who identified a pair of letters written in 1599 by the Jesuit spy George Fenner in which he reported that Derby was:\n\n{{quote|text=busied only in penning comedies for the common players.<ref>[http://www.shakespeareanauthorshiptrust.org.uk/pages/candidates/stanley.htm The Shakespearean Authorship Trust]</ref>}}\n\nFenner was disappointed that Derby was devoting himself to cultural pursuits rather than politics because his family were thought to be sympathetic to the Catholic cause and were possible claimants of the throne in the event of Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nGreenstreet argued that Fenner's dismissive comment revealed that unknown works were penned by Derby. He argued that these could be identified with the Shakespeare canon. He suggested that the comic scenes in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' were influenced by a pageant of the [[Nine Worthies]] only ever performed in Derby's home town of Chester. He also argued that the comic character of the pedant Holofernes in the play is based on Derby's tutor Richard Lloyd, who wrote a dramatic poem about the Nine Worthies that appears to be parodied in Holofernes' own production on the topic in the play.<ref>Greenstreet, James. \"A Hitherto Unknown Noble Writer of Elizabethan Comedies\" , ''The Genealogist'', New Series, 1891, Vol. 7</ref> Greenstreet attempted to develop his ideas in a second paper,<ref>Greenstreet, James, \"Testimonies against the accepted authorship of Shakespear\u2019s Plays\", ''The Genealogist'', Vol. 8, p. 141. London 1892.</ref>  but died suddenly at the age of forty-five in 1892, leaving his arguments incomplete.\n\n==Frazer==\nGreenstreet's theory was revived by the American writer Robert Frazer, who argued in ''The Silent Shakespeare'' (1915) that the actor William Shakespeare merely commercialised the productions of other authors, mainly by adding vulgar comic scenes. He believed that Derby was the principal author of the more elevated material in the Shakespeare plays, though both he and Shakespeare were probably adapting older works. Derby was responsible for \"those fine passages which Will Shakespeare and his fellows sometimes omitted in representation in order to make room for their own buffooneries\". He was, however, the sole author of the sonnets and narrative poems. Frazer concludes that \"William Stanley was William Shakespeare\".<ref>Robert Frazer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BaoXAAAAYAAJ ''The Silent Shakespeare''], Philadelphia, (1915), p. 210.</ref>\n\n==Lefranc==\n[[File:Abel Lefranc.jpg|thumb|Abel Lefranc]]\nThe idea was then taken up in France and was first advocated in scholarly detail when the [[Rabelais]] expert [[Abel Lefranc]] published his 1918 book ''Sous le masque de William Shakespeare: William Stanley, VIe comte de Derby''. Lefranc added to Greenstreet's arguments, providing scholarly details.\n\n===''Love's Labour's Lost''===\nLefranc drew on the fact that Derby had spent some years travelling in Europe, during which time he may have witnessed events in the Court of Navarre that are reflected in the more serious portions of ''Love's Labour's Lost''. Lefranc stated that the play is a \"reflection of a scintillating episode in our [France's] history ...The very substance of the play, far more than scholars have imagined, is impregnated with quite recognisable French elements.\" He insisted that the author must have had \"virtually impeccable and absolutely amazing acquaintance with aspects France and Navarre of the period that could have been known only to a very limited number of people\".<ref name = \"lon\"/>\n\nHe argued that the events on which the play was based occurred between 1578 and 1584. The \"scintillating episode\" was the visit of [[Marguerite de Valois]] and her companions to her estranged husband Henry of Navarre, the future king [[Henry IV of France]]. Henry was accompanied by \"a handsome troupe of lords and gentlemen\", while Marguerite was accompanied by her mother [[Catherine de' Medici]] and a large entourage. The visit occasioned elaborate festivities. Disputes about the control of [[Aquitaine]] and the rights to a dowry, alluded to in the play, were the motivation for the visit.\n\nLefranc also provided further details on the role of the Nine Worthies, arguing that the play referred to tapestries depicting the subject in Navarre. The satirical comment that one of the badly-acted worthies in the play \"will be scraped out of the painted cloth for this\" implies a reference to the tapestries.<ref name = \"lon\"/> Lefranc also expanded on the similarities between Lloyd's poem about the worthies and the pageant in the play.\n\n===Other plays===\n[[File:Elizabeth de Vere.jpg|thumb|Lefranc believed that ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was written by Derby for his wife Elizabeth on the occasion of their wedding]]\n\nLefranc identified a number of other links between Derby and characters in Shakespeare's plays. In addition to ''Love's Labour's Lost'', he concentrated on ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', ''Twelfth Night'', ''Hamlet'', and ''The Tempest''. He argued that ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was written for Derby's own marriage to [[Elizabeth de Vere, Countess of Derby|Elizabeth de Vere]]. The ''Pyramus and Thisbe'' section was \"evidently modelled on one of the popular plays performed by the artisans of Chester\".<ref name = \"betters\">R. C. Churchill, ''Shakespeare and His Betters: A History and a Criticism of the Attempts Which Have Been Made to Prove That Shakespeare's Works Were Written by Others'', Max Reinhardt, London, 1958, pp. 84\u201391</ref>\n\nLefranc believed that ''Hamlet'' contained coded references to the story of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and her first husband [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]].<ref name = \"betters\"/> Ophelia in ''Hamlet'' was a portrait of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Tournon, a young woman who is supposed to have died of love and whose story was told by [[Pierre de Ronsard]].  Lefranc interpreted ''Hamlet'''s relationship with the Players as a reference to Derby's own involvement with the theatre, discerning in the figure of Hamlet a self-portrait, in which Hamlet's travels beyond Denmark represent William Stanley, Earl of Derby's own sojourn in continental Europe. He claimed Jacques in ''As You Like It'' was also a self portrait. Both figures are aristocrats but also outsiders with a \"tendency to melancholia\".<ref>Lefranc, ''Sous le Masque de William Shakespeare'', Payot, 1919, pp. 156ff.</ref>\n\n''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' was based on events in Derby's life and the character of Malvolio in ''Twelfth Night'' was a parody of William ffarrington, a steward who worked for the Stanley family.\n\nProspero in ''The Tempest'' was based on [[John Dee]], with whom Derby was well acquainted. The play is unusual for portraying the use of magic in a positive way, which suggested to Lefranc that Derby was justifying the activities of his friend. He argued that the name [[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]] derived from Dee's invocation of the spirits \"[[Anael]] and [[Uriel]]\".<ref name = \"betters\"/>\n\n===Other evidence===\nLefranc also discussed Stanley's long-standing connections to the theatre. His older brother [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]], had formed a group of [[actor|players]] which evolved into Shakespeare's troupe [[The King's Men]].<ref name = \"man\">Lawrence Manley, \"From Strange's Men to Pembroke's Men: 2 \"Henry VI\" and \"The First Part of the Contention\".\", Shakespeare Quarterly, vol. 54, No. 3 (Autumn, 2003), pp. 253\u201387.</ref> Derby also patronized this troupe, which became \"Derby's Men\", and he gave financial support to the [[Children of Paul's]]. Stanley may have been deterred from publishing in his own name because of the sensitive content of the works and the aristocratic \"[[stigma of print]]\", which associated publication with vulgar commercialism.\n\nLefranc noted that Derby was also closely associated with [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]], and his brother [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Philip Herbert]], Earl of Montgomery and later 4th Earl of Pembroke, the two dedicatees of the 1623 Shakespearean folio. Around 1628 to 1629, when Derby released his estates to his son James, who became the 7th Earl, the named trustees were Pembroke and Montgomery. Derby appears to have supported [[Richard Barnfield]], two of whose works were published under Shakespeare's name. His second volume of poems, ''Cynthia, with certain Sonnets, and the legend of Cassandra'' was dedicated to Derby in terms which imply close personal relations.\n\nLefranc believed that Derby may have had an affair with [[Mary Fitton]], a candidate for the [[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]] of the sonnets. Lefranc considered Derby to be sympathetic to France and to Catholicism, views he also believed to be present in the plays.

Derby is one of several individuals who have been claimed by advocates of the [[Shakespeare authorship question]] to be the true author of Shakespeare's works.\n\nThe theory was first proposed in 1891, and was taken up predominantly by French writers in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nMainstream scholarship dismisses all alternative candidates for authorship of the works, but accepts that Shakespeare sometimes [[William Shakespeare's collaborations|worked in collaborations]] with other professional playwrights such as [[George Peele]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]. Some mainstream writers have taken the view that Derby may have had links to Shakespeare. Some of the Derbyite arguments about ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' have also been integrated into mainstream scholarship.<ref name = \"lon\">[[Felicia Hardison Londr\u00e9]] (ed), ''Love's labour's lost: critical essays'', Routledge, 1997, pp. 84ff, 327.</ref>\n\n==Greenstreet==\nDerby's candidacy was first raised as a possibility in 1891 by the archivist James H. Greenstreet, who identified a pair of letters written in 1599 by the Jesuit spy George Fenner in which he reported that Derby was:\n\n{{quote|text=busied only in penning comedies for the common players.<ref>[http://www.shakespeareanauthorshiptrust.org.uk/pages/candidates/stanley.htm The Shakespearean Authorship Trust]</ref>}}\n\nFenner was disappointed that Derby was devoting himself to cultural pursuits rather than politics because his family were thought to be sympathetic to the Catholic cause and were possible claimants of the throne in the event of Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nGreenstreet argued that Fenner's dismissive comment revealed that unknown works were penned by Derby. He argued that these could be identified with the Shakespeare canon. He suggested that the comic scenes in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' were influenced by a pageant of the [[Nine Worthies]] only ever performed in Derby's home town of Chester. He also argued that the comic character of the pedant Holofernes in the play is based on Derby's tutor Richard Lloyd, who wrote a dramatic poem about the Nine Worthies that appears to be parodied in Holofernes' own production on the topic in the play.<ref>Greenstreet, James. \"A Hitherto Unknown Noble Writer of Elizabethan Comedies\" , ''The Genealogist'', New Series, 1891, Vol. 7</ref> Greenstreet attempted to develop his ideas in a second paper,<ref>Greenstreet, James, \"Testimonies against the accepted authorship of Shakespear\u2019s Plays\", ''The Genealogist'', Vol. 8, p. 141. London 1892.</ref>  but died suddenly at the age of forty-five in 1892, leaving his arguments incomplete.\n\n==Frazer==\nGreenstreet's theory was revived by the American writer Robert Frazer, who argued in ''The Silent Shakespeare'' (1915) that the actor William Shakespeare merely commercialised the productions of other authors, mainly by adding vulgar comic scenes. He believed that Derby was the principal author of the more elevated material in the Shakespeare plays, though both he and Shakespeare were probably adapting older works. Derby was responsible for \"those fine passages which Will Shakespeare and his fellows sometimes omitted in representation in order to make room for their own buffooneries\". He was, however, the sole author of the sonnets and narrative poems. Frazer concludes that \"William Stanley was William Shakespeare\".<ref>Robert Frazer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BaoXAAAAYAAJ ''The Silent Shakespeare''], Philadelphia, (1915), p. 210.</ref>\n\n==Lefranc==\n[[File:Abel Lefranc.jpg|thumb|Abel Lefranc]]\nThe idea was then taken up in France and was first advocated in scholarly detail when the [[Rabelais]] expert [[Abel Lefranc]] published his 1918 book ''Sous le masque de William Shakespeare: William Stanley, VIe comte de Derby''. Lefranc added to Greenstreet's arguments, providing scholarly details.\n\n===''Love's Labour's Lost''===\nLefranc drew on the fact that Derby had spent some years travelling in Europe, during which time he may have witnessed events in the Court of Navarre that are reflected in the more serious portions of ''Love's Labour's Lost''. Lefranc stated that the play is a \"reflection of a scintillating episode in our [France's] history ...The very substance of the play, far more than scholars have imagined, is impregnated with quite recognisable French elements.\" He insisted that the author must have had \"virtually impeccable and absolutely amazing acquaintance with aspects France and Navarre of the period that could have been known only to a very limited number of people\".<ref name = \"lon\"/>\n\nHe argued that the events on which the play was based occurred between 1578 and 1584. The \"scintillating episode\" was the visit of [[Marguerite de Valois]] and her companions to her estranged husband Henry of Navarre, the future king [[Henry IV of France]]. Henry was accompanied by \"a handsome troupe of lords and gentlemen\", while Marguerite was accompanied by her mother [[Catherine de' Medici]] and a large entourage. The visit occasioned elaborate festivities. Disputes about the control of [[Aquitaine]] and the rights to a dowry, alluded to in the play, were the motivation for the visit.\n\nLefranc also provided further details on the role of the Nine Worthies, arguing that the play referred to tapestries depicting the subject in Navarre. The satirical comment that one of the badly-acted worthies in the play \"will be scraped out of the painted cloth for this\" implies a reference to the tapestries.<ref name = \"lon\"/> Lefranc also expanded on the similarities between Lloyd's poem about the worthies and the pageant in the play.\n\n===Other plays===\n[[File:Elizabeth de Vere.jpg|thumb|Lefranc believed that ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was written by Derby for his wife Elizabeth on the occasion of their wedding]]\n\nLefranc identified a number of other links between Derby and characters in Shakespeare's plays. In addition to ''Love's Labour's Lost'', he concentrated on ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', ''Twelfth Night'', ''Hamlet'', and ''The Tempest''. He argued that ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was written for Derby's own marriage to [[Elizabeth de Vere, Countess of Derby|Elizabeth de Vere]]. The ''Pyramus and Thisbe'' section was \"evidently modelled on one of the popular plays performed by the artisans of Chester\".<ref name = \"betters\">R. C. Churchill, ''Shakespeare and His Betters: A History and a Criticism of the Attempts Which Have Been Made to Prove That Shakespeare's Works Were Written by Others'', Max Reinhardt, London, 1958, pp. 84\u201391</ref>\n\nLefranc believed that ''Hamlet'' contained coded references to the story of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and her first husband [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]].<ref name = \"betters\"/> Ophelia in ''Hamlet'' was a portrait of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Tournon, a young woman who is supposed to have died of love and whose story was told by [[Pierre de Ronsard]].  Lefranc interpreted ''Hamlet'''s relationship with the Players as a reference to Derby's own involvement with the theatre, discerning in the figure of Hamlet a self-portrait, in which Hamlet's travels beyond Denmark represent William Stanley, Earl of Derby's own sojourn in continental Europe. He claimed Jacques in ''As You Like It'' was also a self portrait. Both figures are aristocrats but also outsiders with a \"tendency to melancholia\".<ref>Lefranc, ''Sous le Masque de William Shakespeare'', Payot, 1919, pp. 156ff.</ref>\n\n''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' was based on events in Derby's life and the character of Malvolio in ''Twelfth Night'' was a parody of William ffarrington, a steward who worked for the Stanley family.\n\nProspero in ''The Tempest'' was based on [[John Dee]], with whom Derby was well acquainted. The play is unusual for portraying the use of magic in a positive way, which suggested to Lefranc that Derby was justifying the activities of his friend. He argued that the name [[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]] derived from Dee's invocation of the spirits \"[[Anael]] and [[Uriel]]\".<ref name = \"betters\"/>\n\n===Other evidence===\nLefranc also discussed Stanley's long-standing connections to the theatre. His older brother [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]], had formed a group of [[actor|players]] which evolved into Shakespeare's troupe [[The King's Men]].<ref name = \"man\">Lawrence Manley, \"From Strange's Men to Pembroke's Men: 2 \"Henry VI\" and \"The First Part of the Contention\".\", Shakespeare Quarterly, vol. 54, No. 3 (Autumn, 2003), pp. 253\u201387.</ref> Derby also patronized this troupe, which became \"Derby's Men\", and he gave financial support to the [[Children of Paul's]]. Stanley may have been deterred from publishing in his own name because of the sensitive content of the works and the aristocratic \"[[stigma of print]]\", which associated publication with vulgar commercialism.\n\nLefranc noted that Derby was also closely associated with [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]], and his brother [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Philip Herbert]], Earl of Montgomery and later 4th Earl of Pembroke, the two dedicatees of the 1623 Shakespearean folio. Around 1628 to 1629, when Derby released his estates to his son James, who became the 7th Earl, the named trustees were Pembroke and Montgomery. Derby appears to have supported [[Richard Barnfield]], two of whose works were published under Shakespeare's name. His second volume of poems, ''Cynthia, with certain Sonnets, and the legend of Cassandra'' was dedicated to Derby in terms which imply close personal relations.\n\nLefranc believed that Derby may have had an affair with [[Mary Fitton]], a candidate for the [[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]] of the sonnets. Lefranc considered Derby to be sympathetic to France and to Catholicism, views he also believed to be present in the plays. Derby's proficiency in French would explain Shakespeare's use of the language in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. Lefranc also noted that Derby's own name is strikingly similar to the name 'William Shakespeare'; Stanley's first name was William, his initials were W.S., and he was known to sign himself, 'Will'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lefranc|1923|p=23}}</ref>\n\nLefranc continued to publish arguments for his theory until shortly before his death in 1952.

During the early 1990s he was hailed as a rising talent, however his career was ended by his early death in 1994, while attempting to save his mother from her burning house.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Little Bimbo===\nSmith was born in [[Bromelia, Jamaica]].  His singing career began at the age of twelve, when he performed under the name Little Bimbo.<ref name=\"Thompson\">Thompson, Dave (2002) \"Reggae & Caribbean Music\", Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-655-6}}</ref> During the 1980s he worked as a [[DJ (Jamaican)|deejay]] on [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound systems]] such as ''Conquering Lion'', ''Soul Remembrance'', ''Pepper's Disco'', ''Stereophonic'', and ''Destiny Outernational'' (where he first met [[Tony Rebel]]).<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> He recorded his first track in 1985, but it would be two years later before his first single, \"Problem Everywhere\" was released.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> An album of material from this period (''Journey'') was later released. In 1988, he joined [[Sugar Minott]]'s ''Youth Promotion'' label, releasing \"No Disrespect\", and working regularly with Tony Rebel, Smith now being billed simply as 'Bimbo'. The pair began performing as a duo around the sound systems to much acclaim. The ''Garnett Silk Meets the Conquering Lion: A Dub Plate Selection'' album dates from about this time and features a clutch of exclusive recordings the DJ cut for the sound system from the mid-1980s through the end of the decade. Rebel, a [[Rastafari movement|Rastarfari]], eventually converted Smith to his religion with the help of [[dub poetry|dub poet]] [[Yasus Afari]], a close friend of both the DJs.<ref name=\"Thompson\" />\n\n===Singing career===\nIn 1989, at the suggestion of veteran singer [[Derrick Morgan]], Smith turned from deejaying to singing, with a recording session at [[Bunny Lee]]'s studio with Rebel, including tracks recorded separately, as a duo, and with Anthony Selassie, and he began working under his real name.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> The [[Heartbeat Records|Heartbeat]] label's ''[[Tony Rebel Meets Garnett Silk in a Dancehall Conference]]'' compiles these early Morgan-overseen recordings. The success of this session led him to continue as a singer, going on to work with producers [[King Tubby]], [[Prince Jammy]], and [[Donovan Germain]], before signing a two-year contract with [[Steely & Clevie]] in 1990, recording an album's worth of songs for them. It was the production duo who decided to change his name to Garnet Silk, in reference to his smooth voice.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /><ref>Bonitto, Brian (2014) \"[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Garnet-Silk-earns-his-name-_18031145 Garnet Silk earns his name]\", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 29 November 2014. Retrieved 29 November 2014</ref> Only one of the tracks recorded during this period, \"We Can Be Together,\" a duet with [[Chevelle Franklin]], was actually released at the time, and discouraged by this, he returned to Manchester and threw himself into songwriting, often in partnership with an old friend, Anthony \"Fire\" Rochester.<ref name=\"Thompson\" />\n\nAnother encounter with Tony Rebel brought an introduction to Courtney Cole, owner of the Roof International label. Silk would record a plethora of songs at the producer's [[Ocho Rios]] studio, amongst them were the hits \"Mama,\" \"Seven Spanish Angels,\" and a cover of the [[Johnny Nash]] classic \"I Can See Clearly Now\". Roof International would posthumously bundle up these early singles and other material recorded at this time for the ''Nothing Can Divide Us'' album, which the [[VP Records|VP]] label picked up for the US\n\nBy 1992, Silk was in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] in the studio with producer [[Bobby Digital (Jamaican producer)|Bobby Digital]], recording his debut album ''It's Growing''. Split between deeply cultural themes, spiritual songs, and romantic numbers, the album went on to become one of the best selling in Jamaica that year, and he had his first major [[hit single]] with \"Hey Mama Africa\" (produced by Richard \"Bello\" Bell) for the Star Trail label, which was Silk's first international hit, and topped the reggae chart in Britain.<ref name=\"Thompson\" />\n\nOver the next two years, the singer would record with most of the major name producers on the island, both on his own and in partnership with Tony Rebel. He cut a swathe of songs with King Jammy, including \"Fill Us Up With Your Mercy\" and \"Lord Watch Over Our Shoulders.\" The latter track titled a 1994 compilation released by the Greensleeves label in the UK and boasts seven Jammy cuts and a clutch of hits for other producers.\n\n1993's ''Gold'', released by the UK Charm label, bundled up more hits from this period. Amongst them was \"Zion in a Vision,\" a Jamaican number one cut with producer [[Black Scorpio|Jack Scorpio]], as well as \"Hey Mama Africa\". he also recorded for [[Sly & Robbie]], including the deeply religious \"Thank You, Jah\" and the haunting \"Green Line.\" But the pace was becoming too much and Silk collapsed during a show at the Ritz in New York City, suffering from low blood pressure and exhaustion.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> The exhausted singer was forced to cancel all his scheduled appearances for the next six months, most crucially of all, what would have been his debut at [[Reggae Sumfest]]. However, Silk bounced back in 1994 and set back to work. In a show of good grace, he rejoined Steely & Clevie and cut the \"Love Is the Answer\" single, another massive hit. \"Fight Back,\" produced by Richie Stephens, was next up. By then, the singer was ready to re-take the stage, which he did with a vengeance, headlining that year's Reggae Sumfest and [[Reggae Sunsplash]] festivals.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> His set at the latter event was captured for the ''Live at Reggae Sunsplash 1994'' album, released in 1999 by the Tabou1 label. Silk's backing band was Jahpostles, who originally formed in the late 1970s.<ref name=\"Campbell2012\">Campbell, Howard (2012) \"[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/Entertainment/Jahpostles-trod-on_12486182 Jahpostles trod on]\", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 10 September 2012, retrieved 10 September 2012</ref>\n\n===Death===\nHaving signed an international distribution deal with [[Atlantic Records]], Silk now entered [[Tuff Gong]] studios with producer [[Errol Brown]] and the cream of Jamaica's session men (including [[Aston Barrett]], Sly & Robbie, [[Tyrone Downie]], [[Earl \"Chinna\" Smith]], and [[Uziah \"Sticky\" Thompson]]), to begin work on his second album. He'd recorded ten songs and the album was nearing completion when he went home to visit his mother. Silk had borrowed a pair of guns from his attorney after his home had been burglarized, but had no idea how to use them. Sitting with a couple of friends at his mother's house in [[Mandeville, Jamaica]], on 9 December, one offered to show him how they worked, at which point the gun accidentally misfired, hitting a [[propane]] tank and setting the house ablaze.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> The singer, his friends, and his two brothers made it out safely, only to discover that Silk's mother was still trapped inside. The singer rushed back into the house to save her, but it was too late and both were lost in the fire.<ref name=\"Thompson\" />\n\n===Posthumous===\nSilk's music has been kept alive by several tributes, including [[Macka B]]'s \"Tribute to Garnett Silk\" and the Earth Day concert, and numerous compilation albums, including two collections of his dubplates, ''Kilimanjaro Remembers Garnett Silk'' (Jam Down, 1999) and ''Rule Dem'' (Trojan/Sanctuary 2006).\n\nIn 2000, Atlantic finally released ''The Definitive Collection'', a two-CD set showcasing the ten tracks the singer had recorded during sessions for his unfinished second album.\n\n[[Jet Star (record distribution company)|Jet Star]] also released a greatest hits [[compilation album]], ''[[Gold (Garnett Silk album)|Gold]]'' in 2000.

''Satur'' meant \"full\" but the juxtaposition with ''lanx'' shifted the meaning to \"miscellany or medley\": the expression ''lanx satura'' literally means \"a full dish of various kinds of fruits\".<ref name=\"Kharpertian\">{{Citation | first = Theodore D | last = Kharpertian | contribution = Thomas Pynchon and Postmodern American Satire | pages = 25\u20137 | editor-last = Kharpertian | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=um0h0arlUdoC | title = A hand to turn the time: the Menippean satires of Thomas Pynchon| isbn = 9780838633618 | year = 1990 }}</ref>\n\nThe word ''satura'' as used by [[Quintilian]], however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed [[hexameter]] form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as ''satire''.<ref name=\"Kharpertian\" />{{Sfn | Branham | 1997 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=XrNEns3_yd0C&pg=PR24 xxiv]}} Quintilian famously said that ''satura,'' that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin (''satura tota nostra est''). He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be [[Aristophanes' Old Comedy]]. The first critic to use the term \"satire\" in the modern broader sense was [[Apuleius]].<ref name=\"Kharpertian\"/>\n\nTo Quintilian, the satire was a strict literary form, but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition. Robert Elliott writes:\n{{quote | As soon as a noun enters the domain of metaphor, as one modern scholar has pointed out, it clamours for extension; and satura (which had had no verbal, adverbial, or adjectival forms) was immediately broadened by appropriation from the Greek word for \u201csatyr\u201d (satyros) and its derivatives. The odd result is that the English \u201csatire\u201d comes from the Latin satura; but \"satirize\", \"satiric\", etc., are of Greek origin. By about the 4th century AD the writer of satires came to be known as satyricus; St. Jerome, for example, was called by one of his enemies 'a satirist in prose' ('satyricus scriptor in prosa').  Subsequent orthographic modifications obscured the Latin origin of the word satire: satura becomes satyra, and in England, by the 16th century, it was written 'satyre.'{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}}}}\n\nThe word ''satire'' derives from ''satura'', and its origin was not influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure of the ''[[satyr]]''.<ref>{{Citation | quote = The [[Renaissance]] confusion of the two origins encouraged a satire more aggressive than that of its Roman forebearers | first = BL | last = Ullman | title = Satura and Satire | journal = Classical Philology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 172\u2013194 | year = 1913 | jstor = 262450 | doi = 10.1086/359771 }}</ref> In the 17th century, philologist [[Isaac Casaubon]] was the first to dispute the etymology of satire from satyr, contrary to the belief up to that time.<ref>Antonia Szabari (2009) ''Less Rightly Said: Scandals and Readers in Sixteenth-Century France'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3-QJLqEwvb0C&pg=PA2 p.2]</ref>\n\n==Humour==\n{{rquote|right|The rules of satire are such that it must do more than make you laugh.

Horatian satire follows this same pattern of \"gently [ridiculing] the absurdities and follies of human beings\" (Drury).<ref name=nku.edu>{{cite web|url=http://www.nku.edu/~rkdrury/422/satire_terms.html|title=Satire Terms|work=nku.edu}}</ref>\n\nIt directs wit, exaggeration, and self-deprecating humour toward what it identifies as folly, rather than evil.

Juvenal disagreed with the opinions of the public figures and institutions of the Republic and actively attacked them through his literature. \"He utilized the satirical tools of exaggeration and parody to make his targets appear monstrous and incompetent\" (Podzemny).<ref name=\"wisegeek.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-juvenalian-satire.htm|title=What Is Juvenalian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}</ref> Juvenal's satire follows this same pattern of abrasively ridiculing societal structures. Juvenal also, unlike Horace, attacked public officials and governmental organizations through his satires, regarding their opinions as not just wrong, but evil.\n\nFollowing in this tradition, Juvenalian satire addresses perceived social evil through scorn, outrage, and savage ridicule. This form is often pessimistic, characterized by the use of irony, sarcasm, moral indignation and personal invective, with less emphasis on humor. Strongly polarized political satire can often be classified as Juvenalian.\n\nA Juvenal satirist's goal is generally to provoke some sort of political or societal change because he sees his opponent or object as evil or harmful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.literarydevices.com/satire/|title=Satire Examples and Definition|work=Literary Devices}}</ref> A Juvenal satirist mocks \"societal structure, power, and civilization\" (Thomas)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/satire-in-literature-definition-types-examples.html|title=Satire in Literature: Definition, Types & Examples|work=Education Portal}}</ref> by exaggerating the words or position of his opponent in order to jeopardize their opponent's reputation and/or power.

[[Comedy of manners]], sometimes also called satire of manners, criticizes mode of life of common people; political satire aims at behavior, manners of politicians, and vices of political systems.

Other important satirists in ancient [[Latin]] are Gaius Lucilius and [[Persius]]. ''Satire'' in their work is much wider than in the modern sense of the word, including fantastic and highly coloured humorous writing with little or no real mocking intent. When Horace criticized [[Augustus]], he used [[veil]]ed ironic terms.

He states that he was surprised they expected people to believe their lies, and stating that he, like them, has no actual knowledge or experience, but shall now tell lies as if he did. He goes on to describe a far more obviously extreme and unrealistic tale, involving interplanetary exploration, war among alien life forms, and life inside a 200 mile long whale back in the terrestrial ocean, all intended to make obvious the fallacies of books like ''[[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]''.\n\n===Medieval Islamic world===\n{{main|Arabic literature#Satire and comedy|Persian satire|l1=Arabic satire}}\n\nMedieval [[Arabic poetry]] included the satiric genre ''hija''.

Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''hija'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the \"art of reprehension\", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troubled beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term \"comedy\" thus gained a new semantic meaning in [[Medieval literature]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain |first=Edwin J |last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|pages=1\u201311|doi=10.2307/470561| jstor=470561}}</ref>\n\n[[Ubayd Zakani]] introduced satire in [[Persian literature]] during the 14th century. His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving [[homosexual]] practices. He wrote the ''Resaleh-ye Delgosha'', as well as ''Akhlaq al-Ashraf'' (\"Ethics of the Aristocracy\") and the famous humorous fable ''Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh'' (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of [[Persian literature]]. Between 1905 and 1911, [[Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi]] and other Iranian writers wrote notable satires.\n\n===Medieval Europe===\nIn the [[Early Middle Ages]], examples of satire were the songs by [[Goliard]]s or [[Clerici vagantes|vagant]]s now best known as an anthology called [[Carmina Burana]] and made famous as texts of a composition by the 20th-century composer [[Carl Orff]]. Satirical poetry is believed to have been popular, although little has survived. With the advent of the [[High Middle Ages]] and the birth of modern [[vernacular literature]] in the 12th century, it began to be used again, most notably by [[Chaucer]]. The disrespectful manner was considered \"unchristian\" and ignored, except for the '''moral satire''', which mocked misbehaviour in Christian terms. Examples are ''Livre des Mani\u00e8res'' by {{interlanguage link|\u00c9tienne de Foug\u00e8res|fr}} (~1178), and some of Chaucer's ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. Sometimes [[Epic poetry|epic poetry (epos)]] was mocked, and even feudal society, but there was hardly a general interest in the genre.\n\n===Early modern western satire===\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0447\u0430 \u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u043f\u044b\u0445.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s 1568 satirical painting ''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]''.]]\nDirect [[social commentary]] via satire returned with a vengeance in the 16th century, when farcical texts such as the works of [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]] tackled more serious issues (and incurred the wrath of the crown as a result).\n\nTwo major satirists of [[Europe]] in the [[Renaissance]] were [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]. Other examples of Renaissance satire include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'', ''[[Reynard the Fox]]'', [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools|Narrenschiff]]'' (1494), [[Erasmus]]'s ''[[Moriae Encomium]]'' (1509), [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), and ''[[Carajicomedia]]'' (1519).'''\n\nThe [[Elizabethan]] (i.e. 16th-century English) writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude, coarse and sharp satyr play. Elizabethan \"satire\" (typically in pamphlet form) therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony. The French [[Huguenot]] [[Isaac Casaubon]] pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised. Casaubon discovered and published Quintilian's writing and presented the original meaning of the term (satira, not satyr), and the sense of wittiness (reflecting the \"dishfull of fruits\") became more important again. Seventeenth-century English satire once again aimed at the \"amendment of vices\" ([[Dryden]]).\n\nIn the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Hall]]'s ''Virgidemiarum'', six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen. Although [[John Donne|Donne]] had already circulated satires in manuscript, Hall's was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model.{{Sfn | Hall | 1969 | ps =: \u2018Hall's ''Virgidemiae'' was a new departure in that the true Juvenalian mode of satire was being attempted for the first time, and successfully, in English.\u2019}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}} The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeth's reign triggered an avalanche of satire\u2014much of it less conscious of classical models than Hall's \u2014 until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship.{{NoteTag|The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, the censors of the press, issued Orders to the Stationers' Company on June 1 and 4, 1599, prohibiting the further printing of satires\u2014the so-called 'Bishop's Ban'.{{Sfn | Davenport | 1969}}{{Rp|needed = yes|date=October 2012}}}}\n\n=== Ancient and modern India ===\nSatire (''Kataksh'' or ''Vyang'') has played a prominent role in [[Indian literature|Indian]] and [[Hindi literature]], and is counted as one of the \"[[Rasa (aesthetics)|ras]]\" of literature in ancient books.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0939\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0935\u094d\u092f\u0902\u0917\u094d\u092f \u0915\u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 Hasya Vyangya Kavita In Hindi funny poetry |url = https://suvicharhindi.com/hasya-vyangya-kavita-hindi/ |website = suvicharhindi.com |access-date=April 19, 2019}}</ref> With the commencement of printing of books in local language in the nineteenth century and especially after India's freedom, this grew.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pritam |first=Sarojani |title=51 Shresth Vyang Rachnayen |publisher=Diamond pocket books}}</ref> Many of the works of [[Tulsi Das]], [[Kabir]], [[Munshi Premchand]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Premchand |first1=Munshi |last2=Gopal |first2=Madan |title=My Life and Times |publisher=Roli Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Premchand |first1=Munshi |title=Premchand Ki Amar Kahaniyan}}</ref> village ministrels, [[Harikatha|Hari katha]] singers, poets, Dalit singers and current day stand up Indian comedians incorporate satire, usually ridiculing authoritarians, fundamentalists  and incompetent people in power.<ref name=\"modisong\">{{cite web |last1=Shankarji |first1=Sung by |title=The Modi song |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh3mlMAkXrE |website=Rough cut productions |publisher=Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan |accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Kunal Kamra: The accidental revolutionary |url=https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/C39AsWWaic7qvGsONZNCnJ/Kunal-Kamra-The-accidental-revolutionary.html |accessdate=April 16, 2019 |newspaper=Live Mint |date=March 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Gujarat Varsity Cancels Show by 'Anti-National' Comedian Kunal Kamra After Alumni Complaint |url=https://thewire.in/humour/kunal-kamra |accessdate=April 16, 2019 |publisher=The Wire}}</ref> In India, it has usually been used as a means of expression and an outlet for common people to express their anger against authoritarian entities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tyagi |first1=Ravindranath |title=Urdu Hindi Hashya Vyang |publisher=Rajkamal Prakashan}}</ref> A popular custom in Northern India of \"Bura na mano Holi hai\" continues, in which comedians on the stage roast local people of importance (who are usually brought in as special guests).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sekhri |first1=Abhinandan |title=Interview with Kunal Kamra |url=https://www.newslaundry.com/ |accessdate=April 19, 2019 |publisher=News laundry |date=April 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Gujarati |first1=Ashok |title=Vyang Ke Rang |publisher=Prabhat Prakashan}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Jaimini |first1=Arun |title=Hasya Vyang Ki Shikhar Kavitaye |isbn=8183615686}}</ref>\n\n===Age of Enlightenment===\n[[File:A Welch wedding. Satire c.1780.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|'A Welch wedding' Satirical Cartoon c.1780]]\n\nThe [[Age of Enlightenment]], an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the [[Tory]] and [[British Whig Party|Whig]] parties\u2014and also, in 1714, by the formation of the [[Scriblerus Club]], which included [[Alexander Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[John Gay]], [[John Arbuthnot]], [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Thomas Parnell]], and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]]. This club included several of the notable satirists of early-18th-century Britain. They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus, \"an invented learned fool... whose work they attributed all that was tedious, narrow-minded, and pedantic in contemporary scholarship\".<ref>{{Citation | title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century | volume = 3 | page = 435}}</ref> In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon. The turn to the 18th century was characterized by a switch from Horatian, soft, pseudo-satire, to biting \"juvenal\" satire.<ref name=\"Weinbrot2007p136\">Weinbrot, Howard D. (2007) ''Eighteenth-Century Satire: Essays on Text and Context from Dryden to Peter...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHADZOHbJ2QC&pg=PA136 p.136]</ref>\n\n[[Jonathan Swift]] was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the \"problem\" of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor. In his book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular. [[John Dryden]] wrote an influential essay entitled \"A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire\"<ref>{{Citation | url = http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/drydendiscourse2.html | editor-first = Jack | editor-last = Lynch | publisher = Rutgers | last = Dryden | first = John | title = Discourse | number = 2}}</ref> that helped fix the definition of satire in the literary world. His satirical ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' was written in response to a rivalry with [[Thomas Shadwell]] and eventually inspired [[Alexander Pope]] to write his satirical ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''. Other satirical works by Pope include the ''[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]''.\n\n[[Alexander Pope]] (b. May 21, 1688) was a satirist known for his Horatian satirist style and translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. Famous throughout and after the [[Long eighteenth century|long 18th century]], Pope died in 1744.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/alexander-pope-9444371#synopsis|title=Biography of Alexander Pope \u00a7 Synopsis|work=Biography.com}}</ref> Pope, in his ''The Rape of the Lock'', is delicately chiding society in a sly but polished voice by holding up a mirror to the follies and vanities of the upper class. Pope does not actively attack the self-important pomp of the British aristocracy, but rather presents it in such a way that gives the reader a new perspective from which to easily view the actions in the story as foolish and ridiculous. A mockery of the upper class, more delicate and lyrical than brutal, Pope nonetheless is able to effectively illuminate the moral degradation of society to the public. ''The Rape of the Lock'' assimilates the masterful qualities of a heroic epic, such as the ''Iliad'', which Pope was translating at the time of writing ''The Rape of the Lock''. However, Pope applied these qualities satirically to a seemingly petty egotistical elitist quarrel to prove his point wryly.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/545/satire-in-18th-century-british-society-alexander-popes-the-rape-of-the-lock-and-jonathan-swifts-a-modest-proposal|title=Satire in 18th Century British Society: Alexander Pope's ''The Rape of the Lock'' and Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal''|year=2011|journal=Student Pulse|volume=3|issue=6|author=Jonathan J.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706\u20131790) and others followed, using satire to shape an emerging nation's culture through its sense of the ridiculous.\n\n===Satire in Victorian England===\n[[File:DV257 no.19 The donkey race.png|thumb|A Victorian satirical sketch depicting a gentleman's donkey race in 1852]]\nSeveral satiric papers competed for the public's attention in the [[Victorian era]] (1837\u20131901) and [[Edwardian]] period, such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (1841) and ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' (1861).\n\nPerhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire, however, are to be found in the [[Savoy Opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. In fact, in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', a jester is given lines that paint a very neat picture of the method and purpose of the satirist, and might almost be taken as a statement of Gilbert's own intent:\n:''\"I can set a braggart quailing with a quip,\n:''The upstart I can wither with a whim;''\n:''He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip,''\n:''But his laughter has an echo that is grim!\"\n\nNovelists such as [[Charles Dickens]] (1812-1870) often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues.\n\nContinuing the tradition of Swiftian journalistic satire, [[Sidney Godolphin Osborne]] (1808-1889) was the most prominent writer of scathing \"Letters to the Editor\" of the [[London Times]]. Famous in his day, he is now all but forgotten. His maternal grandfather [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland]] was considered to be a possible candidate for the authorship of the [[Junius]] letters. If this were true, we can read Osborne as following in his grandfather's satiric \"Letters to the Editor\" path. Osborne's satire was so bitter and biting that at one point he received a public censure from [[Parliament]]'s then Home Secretary Sir [[James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose|James Graham]]. Osborne wrote mostly in the Juvenalian mode over a wide range of topics mostly centered on British government's and landlords' mistreatment of poor farm workers and field laborers. He bitterly opposed the [[New Poor Laws]] and was passionate on the subject of Great Britain's botched response to the [[Irish Famine]] and its mistreatment of soldiers during the [[Crimean War]].\n\nLater in the nineteenth century, in the United States, [[Mark Twain]] (1835\u20131910) grew to become American's greatest satirist: his novel ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884) is set in the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] South, where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads. His hero, Huck, is a rather simple but goodhearted lad who is ashamed of the \"sinful temptation\" that leads him to help a runaway [[Slavery|slave]]. In fact his conscience, warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in, often bothers him most when he is at his best. He is prepared to do good, believing it to be wrong.\n\nTwain's younger contemporary [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1842\u20131913) gained notoriety as a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], pessimist and black humorist with his dark, bitterly ironic stories, many set during the [[American Civil War]], which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason. Bierce's most famous work of satire is probably ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' (1906), in which the definitions mock cant, [[hypocrisy]] and [[Appeal to tradition|received wisdom]].\n\n===20th-century satire===\n[[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] is considered the first major European satirist since [[Jonathan Swift]].<ref name=\"Knight2004p254\">Knight, Charles A. (2004) ''Literature of Satire'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOfVePSFctgC&pg=PA254 p.254]</ref> In 20th-century literature, satire was used by English authors such as [[Aldous Huxley]] (1930s) and [[George Orwell]] (1940s), which under the inspiration of [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Zamyatin]]'s Russian 1921 novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', made serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe. [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] wrote \u2018Satire attains its greatest significance when a newly evolving class creates an ideology considerably more advanced than that of the ruling class, but has not yet developed to the point where it can conquer it. Herein lies its truly great ability to triumph, its scorn for its adversary and its hidden fear of it. Herein lies its venom, its amazing energy of hate, and quite frequently, its grief, like a black frame around glittering images. Herein lie its contradictions, and its power.\u2019<ref>[[David King (graphic designer)|David King]] & Cathy Porter 'Blood & Laughter: Caricatures from the 1905 Revolution' Jonathan Cape 1983 p.31</ref>  Many social critics of this same time in the United States, such as [[Dorothy Parker]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], used satire as their main weapon, and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that \"one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand [[syllogism]]s\" in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism. Novelist [[Sinclair Lewis]] was known for his satirical stories such as ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' (1920), ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'' (1922), ''[[Elmer Gantry]]'' (1927; dedicated by Lewis to H. L. Menchen), and ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' (1935), and his books often explored and satirized contemporary American values. The film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940) by [[Charlie Chaplin]] is itself a parody of [[Adolf Hitler]]; Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].<ref name=\"ChaplinLager\">Chaplin (1964) ''My Autobiography'', p.392, quotation: {{quotation|Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|Benzino Napaloni and [[Adenoid Hynkel]] in ''The Great Dictator'' (1940).

One of the most well-known and controversial British satirists is [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], co-writer and director of ''[[Four Lions]]''.\n\nIn Canada, satire has become an important part of the comedy scene. [[Stephen Leacock]] was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including ''[[CODCO]]'', ''[[The Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[This Is That]]'', and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like ''[[History Bites]]'' present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. [[The Beaverton]] is a Canadian news satire site similar to The Onion. Canadian songwriter [[Nancy White (singer-songwriter)|Nancy White]] uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]].\n\nCartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour. [[Al Capp]]'s satirical [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' was censored in September 1947. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centred on Capp's portrayal of the US Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html |title=Tain't Funny \u2013 ''Time'' |publisher=Time.com |date=September 29, 1947 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}</ref> [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joe McCarthy]], caricatured in his comic strip as \"Simple J. Malarky\". [[Garry Trudeau]], whose [[comic strip]] ''[[Doonesbury]]'' focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character [[Mark Slackmeyer]] lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the \"exquisite agony\" of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage.\n\n[[File:2014- 02 - Obama and Putin, by Ranan Lurie.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Political satire by [[Ranan Lurie]]]]\nLike some literary predecessors, many recent television satires contain strong elements of parody and [[caricature]]; for instance, the popular animated series ''The Simpsons'' and ''South Park'' both parody modern family and social life by taking their assumptions to the extreme; both have led to the creation of similar series. As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors.\n\n[[News satire]] is also a very popular form of contemporary satire, appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself: print (e.g. ''[[The Onion]]'', ''[[Waterford Whispers News]]'', ''[[Private Eye]]''), radio (e.g. ''[[On the Hour]]''), television (e.g. ''[[The Day Today]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', ''[[Brass Eye]]'') and the web (e.g. ''[[Faking News]]'', ''[[El Koshary Today]]'', ''[[Babylon Bee]]'', ''[[The Beaverton]]'', ''[[The Daily Bonnet]]'' and ''[[The Onion]]''). Other satires are on the [[list of satirists and satires]]. Another internet-driven form of satire is to lampoon bad internet performers. An example of this is the [[Internet meme]] character [[Miranda Sings]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Ng | first = David | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/05/miranda-sings-colleen-ballinger-jim-caruso-cast-party-jersey-boys-daniel-reichard.html | title = YouTube sensation Miranda seduces Broadway | journal = Los Angeles Times | date = May 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/04/PKGE19REP8.DTL | title = This Week | journal = San Francisco Chronicle | date = October 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Wikinews]]'', Sean Mills, President of ''[[The Onion]]'', said angry letters about their news parody always carried the same message. \"It's whatever affects that person\", said Mills. \"So it's like, 'I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape, but if you talk about cancer, well my brother has cancer and that's not funny to me.' Or someone else can say, 'Cancer's ''hilarious'', but don't talk about rape because my cousin got raped.' Those are rather extreme examples, but if it affects somebody personally, they tend to be more sensitive about it.\"<ref name=DS>[[n:The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'|An interview with The Onion]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 25, 2007.</ref>\n\n[[Zhou Libo (comedian)|Zhou Libo]], a comedian from [[Shanghai]], is the most popular satirist in China.

Because satire often combines anger and humor, as well as the fact that it addresses and calls into question many controversial issues, it can be profoundly disturbing.\n\n===Typical arguments===\nBecause it is essentially ironic or sarcastic, satire is often misunderstood. A typical misunderstanding is to confuse the satirist with his [[persona]].<ref name=\"Test1991p10\"/>\n\n====Bad taste====\nCommon uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion (accusations of [[Taste (sociology)|poor taste]], or that \"it's just not funny\" for instance) and the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas, policies, or people he is attacking. For instance, at the time of its publication, many people misunderstood Swift's purpose in ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism.\n\n====Targeting the victim====\nSome critics of [[Mark Twain]] see [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (novel)|''Huckleberry Finn'']] as [[racist]] and offensive, missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire (racism being in fact only one of a number of Mark Twain's known concerns attacked in ''Huckleberry Finn'').<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Leonard | first1 = James S | first2 = Thomas A | last2 = Tenney | first3 = Thadious M | last3 = Davis | title = Satire or Evasion?: Black Perspectives on Huckleberry Finn | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] |date=December 1992 | page = 224 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fdrBtpSSCisC&pg=RA1-PA116&lpg=RA1-PA116&dq=hemingway+%22huckleberry+finn%22+%22green+hills%22 | isbn = 978-0-8223-1174-4}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Shelley Fisher | last = Fishin | title = Lighting out for the Territory: Reflections on Mark Twain and American Culture | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997}}</ref> This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]''. The character of [[Alf Garnett]] (played by [[Warren Mitchell]]) was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow-minded, racist, [[little Englander]] that Garnett represented. Instead, his character became a sort of [[anti-hero]] to people who actually agreed with his views. (The same situation occurred with [[Archie Bunker]] in American TV show ''[[All in the Family]]'', a character derived directly from Garnett.)\n\nThe Australian satirical television comedy show ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'' has suffered repeated attacks based on various perceived interpretations of the \"target\" of its attacks. The \"Make a Realistic Wish Foundation\" sketch (June 2009), which attacked in classical satiric fashion the heartlessness of people who are reluctant to donate to [[Charitable organization|charities]], was widely interpreted as an attack on the [[Make a Wish Foundation]], or even the terminally ill children helped by that organisation. [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the time [[Kevin Rudd]] stated that The Chaser team \"should hang their heads in shame\". He went on to say that \"I didn't see that but it's been described to me. ...But having a go at kids with a terminal illness is really beyond the pale, absolutely beyond the pale.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/04/2589532.htm |title='Hang your heads' Rudd tells Chaser boys | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}</ref> Television station management suspended the show for two weeks and reduced the third season to eight episodes.\n\n====Romantic prejudice====\nThe romantic prejudice against satire is the belief spread by the [[Romanticism|romantic movement]] that satire is something unworthy of serious attention; this prejudice has held considerable influence to this day.<ref>{{Citation | last = Sutherland | first = James | author-link = James Runcieman Sutherland | year = 1958 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1 | title = English Satire}}</ref> Such prejudice extends to humour and everything that arouses laughter, which are often underestimated as frivolous and unworthy of serious study.<ref>{{Citation | first = Rod A | last = Martin | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ieAcp2Z_zkIC&pg=PA27 | title = The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach | pages = 27\u20138| isbn = 9780080465999 }}</ref> For instance, humor is generally neglected as a topic of anthropological research and teaching.<ref>{{Citation | last = Apte | first = Mahadev L | year = 1985 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4fuAAAAAMAAJ | title = Humor and laughter: an anthropological approach | chapter = Introduction | page = 23 | quote = The general neglect of humor as a topic of anthropological research is reflected in teaching practice.

Periodically, however, it runs into serious opposition, and people in power who perceive themselves as attacked attempt to censor it or prosecute its practitioners. In a classic example, [[Aristophanes]] was persecuted by the [[demagogue]] [[Cleon]].\n\n====1599 book ban====\nIn 1599, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]] and the [[Bishop of London]] [[Richard Bancroft]], whose offices had the function of licensing books for publication in [[England]], issued a decree banning verse satire. The decree, now known as the [[Bishops' Ban of 1599]], ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]], and others; it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queen's [[Privy Council]], and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse.<ref>{{Citation | title = A Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London, 1554\u20131640 | volume = III | editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Arber | location = London | year = 1875\u201394 | page = 677 }}</ref>\n\nThe motives for the ban are obscure, particularly since some of the books banned had been licensed by the same authorities less than a year earlier. Various scholars have argued that the target was obscenity, libel, or sedition. It seems likely that lingering anxiety about the [[Martin Marprelate]] controversy, in which the bishops themselves had employed satirists, played a role; both [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]], two of the key figures in that controversy, suffered a complete ban on all their works. In the event, though, the ban was little enforced, even by the licensing authority itself.\n\n====21st-century polemics====\nIn 2005, the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] caused global protests by offended Muslims and violent attacks with many [[wikt:fatality|fatalities]] in the [[Near East]]. It was not the first case of [[Muslim]] protests against criticism in the form of satire, but the Western world was surprised by the hostility of the reaction: Any country's flag in which a newspaper chose to publish the parodies was being burnt in a Near East country, then embassies were attacked, killing 139 people in mainly four countries; politicians throughout Europe agreed that satire was an aspect of the [[freedom of speech]], and therefore to be a protected means of dialogue. Iran threatened to start an [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition]], which was immediately responded to by Jews with an [[Israeli Anti-Semitic Cartoons Contest]].\n\nIn 2006 British comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] released ''[[Borat|Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', a \"[[mockumentary]]\" that satirized everyone, from high society to frat boys. The film was criticized by many. Although Baron Cohen is Jewish, some complained that it was [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], and the government of [[Kazakhstan]] boycotted the film. The film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian.\n\nIn 2008, popular South African cartoonist and satirist [[Jonathan Shapiro]] (who is published under the pen name Zapiro) came under fire for depicting then-president of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] [[Jacob Zuma]] in the act of undressing in preparation for the implied rape of 'Lady Justice' which is held down by Zuma loyalists.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-12-18-zuma-claims-r7m-over-zapiro-cartoon| work = Mail and Guardian | date = December 18, 2008 | location = [[South Africa|ZA]] | title= Zuma claims R7m over Zapiro cartoon}}</ref> The cartoon was drawn in response to Zuma's efforts to duck corruption charges, and the controversy was heightened by the fact that Zuma was himself acquitted of [[Jacob Zuma rape trial|rape]] in May 2006.

''Satur'' meant \"full\" but the juxtaposition with ''lanx'' shifted the meaning to \"miscellany or medley\": the expression ''lanx satura'' literally means \"a full dish of various kinds of fruits\".<ref name=\"Kharpertian\">{{Citation | first = Theodore D | last = Kharpertian | contribution = Thomas Pynchon and Postmodern American Satire | pages = 25\u20137 | editor-last = Kharpertian | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=um0h0arlUdoC | title = A hand to turn the time: the Menippean satires of Thomas Pynchon| isbn = 9780838633618 | year = 1990 }}</ref>\n\nThe word ''satura'' as used by [[Quintilian]], however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed [[hexameter]] form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as ''satire''.<ref name=\"Kharpertian\" />{{Sfn | Branham | 1997 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=XrNEns3_yd0C&pg=PR24 xxiv]}} Quintilian famously said that ''satura,'' that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin (''satura tota nostra est''). He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be [[Aristophanes' Old Comedy]]. The first critic to use the term \"satire\" in the modern broader sense was [[Apuleius]].<ref name=\"Kharpertian\"/>\n\nTo Quintilian, the satire was a strict literary form, but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition. Robert Elliott writes:\n{{quote | As soon as a noun enters the domain of metaphor, as one modern scholar has pointed out, it clamours for extension; and satura (which had had no verbal, adverbial, or adjectival forms) was immediately broadened by appropriation from the Greek word for \u201csatyr\u201d (satyros) and its derivatives. The odd result is that the English \u201csatire\u201d comes from the Latin satura; but \"satirize\", \"satiric\", etc., are of Greek origin. By about the 4th century AD the writer of satires came to be known as satyricus; St. Jerome, for example, was called by one of his enemies 'a satirist in prose' ('satyricus scriptor in prosa').  Subsequent orthographic modifications obscured the Latin origin of the word satire: satura becomes satyra, and in England, by the 16th century, it was written 'satyre.'{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}}}}\n\nThe word ''satire'' derives from ''satura'', and its origin was not influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure of the ''[[satyr]]''.<ref>{{Citation | quote = The [[Renaissance]] confusion of the two origins encouraged a satire more aggressive than that of its Roman forebearers | first = BL | last = Ullman | title = Satura and Satire | journal = Classical Philology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 172\u2013194 | year = 1913 | jstor = 262450 | doi = 10.1086/359771 }}</ref> In the 17th century, philologist [[Isaac Casaubon]] was the first to dispute the etymology of satire from satyr, contrary to the belief up to that time.<ref>Antonia Szabari (2009) ''Less Rightly Said: Scandals and Readers in Sixteenth-Century France'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3-QJLqEwvb0C&pg=PA2 p.2]</ref>\n\n==Humour==\n{{rquote|right|The rules of satire are such that it must do more than make you laugh.

Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote Satires to gently ridicule the dominant opinions and \"philosophical beliefs of ancient Rome and Greece\" (Rankin).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-horatian-satire.htm|title=What Is Horatian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}</ref> Rather than writing in harsh or accusing tones, he addressed issues with humor and clever mockery.

Horatian satire's sympathetic tone is common in modern society.<ref>{{cite book|  first = Raja | last = Sharma | title = \"Comedy\" in New Light-Literary Studies|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nA Horatian satirist's goal is to heal the situation with smiles, rather than by anger. Horatian satire is a gentle reminder to take life less seriously and evokes a wry smile.<ref name=nku.edu/> A Horatian satirist makes fun of general human folly rather than engaging in specific or personal attacks. Shamekia Thomas suggests, \"In a work using Horatian satire, readers often laugh at the characters in the story who are the subject of mockery as well as themselves and society for behaving in those ways.\" [[Alexander Pope]] has been established as an author whose satire \"heals with morals what it hurts with wit\" (Green).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/honors/Programs-Minors/honors-and-the-schools/houston-teachers-institute/curriculum-units/pdfs/2008/comedy/green-08-comedy.pdf|title=The Golden Age of Satire: Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift|author=Patricia, Green}}</ref> Alexander Pope\u2014and Horatian satire\u2014attempt to teach.\n\nExamples of Horatian satire:\n\n*The [[Ig Nobel Prize]]s.\n* {{Citation | author-link = Ambrose Bierce | first = Ambrose | last = Bierce | title = The Devil's Dictionary| title-link = The Devil's Dictionary }}.\n* {{Citation | author-link = Daniel Defoe | first = Daniel | last = Defoe | title = The True-Born Englishman| title-link = The True-Born Englishman }}.\n* The [[Savoy Operas]] of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]].\n* {{Citation | author-link = Anthony Trollope | first = Anthony | last = Trollope | title = The Way We Live Now| title-link = The Way We Live Now }}.\n* {{Citation | author-link = Nikolai Gogol | first = Nikolai | last = Gogol | title = Dead Souls| title-link = Dead Souls }}.\n* {{Citation | author-link = Matt Groening | first = Matthew \"Matt\" | last = Groening | title = The Simpsons| title-link = The Simpsons }}.\n* {{Citation | author-link = C.S.

Juvenal disagreed with the opinions of the public figures and institutions of the Republic and actively attacked them through his literature. \"He utilized the satirical tools of exaggeration and parody to make his targets appear monstrous and incompetent\" (Podzemny).<ref name=\"wisegeek.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-juvenalian-satire.htm|title=What Is Juvenalian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}</ref> Juvenal's satire follows this same pattern of abrasively ridiculing societal structures. Juvenal also, unlike Horace, attacked public officials and governmental organizations through his satires, regarding their opinions as not just wrong, but evil.\n\nFollowing in this tradition, Juvenalian satire addresses perceived social evil through scorn, outrage, and savage ridicule. This form is often pessimistic, characterized by the use of irony, sarcasm, moral indignation and personal invective, with less emphasis on humor.

[[Comedy of manners]], sometimes also called satire of manners, criticizes mode of life of common people; political satire aims at behavior, manners of politicians, and vices of political systems. Historically, comedy of manners, which first appeared in British theater in 1620, has uncritically accepted the social code of the upper classes.<ref name=\"Nicoll1951p179\"/> Comedy in general accepts the rules of the social game, while satire subverts them.<ref name=\"Hodgart2009p189\"/>\n\nAnother analysis of satire is the spectrum of his possible [[Tone (literature)|tone]]s: [[wit]], [[ridicule]], [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynicism]], the [[sardonic]] and [[invective]].<ref name=\"Pollard1970p66\"/><ref name=\"Clark1946p32\"/> \n\nThe type of humour that deals with creating laughter at the expense of the person telling the joke is called reflexive humour<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Zekavat|first=Massih|date=2019|title=Reflexive humour and satire: a critical review|url=https://europeanjournalofhumour.org/index.php/ejhr/article/view/285/pdf|journal=European Journal of Humour|volume=7 (4)|pages=125-136|via=Open Access Journal}}</ref>.Reflexive humour can take place at dual levels of directing humour at self or at the larger community the self identifies with.

The two most prominent and influential ancient Roman satirists are [[Horace]] and [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], who wrote during the early days of the [[Roman Empire]]. Other important satirists in ancient [[Latin]] are Gaius Lucilius and [[Persius]]. ''Satire'' in their work is much wider than in the modern sense of the word, including fantastic and highly coloured humorous writing with little or no real mocking intent. When Horace criticized [[Augustus]], he used [[veil]]ed ironic terms. In contrast, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] reports that the 6th-century-BC poet [[Hipponax]] wrote ''satirae'' that were so cruel that the offended hanged themselves.<ref>{{Citation | last = Cuddon | title = Dictionary of Literary Terms | place = Oxford | year = 1998 | contribution = Satire}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, [[Lucian]] wrote ''[[True History]]'', a book satirizing the clearly unrealistic travelogues/adventures written by [[Ctesias]], [[Iambulus]], and [[Homer]]. He states that he was surprised they expected people to believe their lies, and stating that he, like them, has no actual knowledge or experience, but shall now tell lies as if he did. He goes on to describe a far more obviously extreme and unrealistic tale, involving interplanetary exploration, war among alien life forms, and life inside a 200 mile long whale back in the terrestrial ocean, all intended to make obvious the fallacies of books like ''[[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]''.\n\n===Medieval Islamic world===\n{{main|Arabic literature#Satire and comedy|Persian satire|l1=Arabic satire}}\n\nMedieval [[Arabic poetry]] included the satiric genre ''hija''. Satire was introduced into [[Arabic literature|Arabic prose literature]] by the author [[Al-Jahiz]] in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as [[anthropology]], [[Sociology in medieval Islam|sociology]] and [[Psychology in medieval Islam|psychology]], he introduced a satirical approach, \"based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations. He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in ''hija'', satirical poetry.\"{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 32}} For example, in one of his [[Zoology|zoological]] works, he satirized the preference for longer [[human penis size]], writing: \"If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the [[mule]] would belong to the (honorable tribe of) [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]\". Another satirical story based on this preference was an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale called \"Ali with the Large Member\".<ref>{{Cite book| title = The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia | first1 = Ulrich | last1 = Marzolph | first2 = Richard | last2 = van Leeuwen| first3 = Hassan | last3 = Wassouf | publisher = ABC-CLIO| year = 2004 | isbn= 1-57607-204-5|pages=97\u20138}}</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, the writer [[Tha'alibi]] recorded satirical poetry written by the Arabic poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulaf's [[Polymath|wide breadth of knowledge]] and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| pp = 77\u20138}} An example of Arabic political satire included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as \"a transgressor of the [[Sharia]]\" and later Arabic poets in turn using the term \"Farazdaq-like\" as a form of political satire.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 70}}\n\nThe terms \"[[comedy]]\" and \"satire\" became synonymous after [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] and writers, such as Abu Bischr, his pupil [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''hija'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the \"art of reprehension\", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troubled beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term \"comedy\" thus gained a new semantic meaning in [[Medieval literature]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain |first=Edwin J |last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|pages=1\u201311|doi=10.2307/470561| jstor=470561}}</ref>\n\n[[Ubayd Zakani]] introduced satire in [[Persian literature]] during the 14th century. His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving [[homosexual]] practices. He wrote the ''Resaleh-ye Delgosha'', as well as ''Akhlaq al-Ashraf'' (\"Ethics of the Aristocracy\") and the famous humorous fable ''Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh'' (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of [[Persian literature]]. Between 1905 and 1911, [[Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi]] and other Iranian writers wrote notable satires.\n\n===Medieval Europe===\nIn the [[Early Middle Ages]], examples of satire were the songs by [[Goliard]]s or [[Clerici vagantes|vagant]]s now best known as an anthology called [[Carmina Burana]] and made famous as texts of a composition by the 20th-century composer [[Carl Orff]]. Satirical poetry is believed to have been popular, although little has survived. With the advent of the [[High Middle Ages]] and the birth of modern [[vernacular literature]] in the 12th century, it began to be used again, most notably by [[Chaucer]]. The disrespectful manner was considered \"unchristian\" and ignored, except for the '''moral satire''', which mocked misbehaviour in Christian terms. Examples are ''Livre des Mani\u00e8res'' by {{interlanguage link|\u00c9tienne de Foug\u00e8res|fr}} (~1178), and some of Chaucer's ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. Sometimes [[Epic poetry|epic poetry (epos)]] was mocked, and even feudal society, but there was hardly a general interest in the genre.\n\n===Early modern western satire===\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0447\u0430 \u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u043f\u044b\u0445.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s 1568 satirical painting ''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]''.]]\nDirect [[social commentary]] via satire returned with a vengeance in the 16th century, when farcical texts such as the works of [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]] tackled more serious issues (and incurred the wrath of the crown as a result).\n\nTwo major satirists of [[Europe]] in the [[Renaissance]] were [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]. Other examples of Renaissance satire include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'', ''[[Reynard the Fox]]'', [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools|Narrenschiff]]'' (1494), [[Erasmus]]'s ''[[Moriae Encomium]]'' (1509), [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), and ''[[Carajicomedia]]'' (1519).'''\n\nThe [[Elizabethan]] (i.e. 16th-century English) writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude, coarse and sharp satyr play. Elizabethan \"satire\" (typically in pamphlet form) therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony. The French [[Huguenot]] [[Isaac Casaubon]] pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised. Casaubon discovered and published Quintilian's writing and presented the original meaning of the term (satira, not satyr), and the sense of wittiness (reflecting the \"dishfull of fruits\") became more important again. Seventeenth-century English satire once again aimed at the \"amendment of vices\" ([[Dryden]]).\n\nIn the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Hall]]'s ''Virgidemiarum'', six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen. Although [[John Donne|Donne]] had already circulated satires in manuscript, Hall's was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model.{{Sfn | Hall | 1969 | ps =: \u2018Hall's ''Virgidemiae'' was a new departure in that the true Juvenalian mode of satire was being attempted for the first time, and successfully, in English.\u2019}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}} The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeth's reign triggered an avalanche of satire\u2014much of it less conscious of classical models than Hall's \u2014 until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship.{{NoteTag|The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, the censors of the press, issued Orders to the Stationers' Company on June 1 and 4, 1599, prohibiting the further printing of satires\u2014the so-called 'Bishop's Ban'.{{Sfn | Davenport | 1969}}{{Rp|needed = yes|date=October 2012}}}}\n\n=== Ancient and modern India ===\nSatire (''Kataksh'' or ''Vyang'') has played a prominent role in [[Indian literature|Indian]] and [[Hindi literature]], and is counted as one of the \"[[Rasa (aesthetics)|ras]]\" of literature in ancient books.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0939\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0935\u094d\u092f\u0902\u0917\u094d\u092f \u0915\u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 Hasya Vyangya Kavita In Hindi funny poetry |url = https://suvicharhindi.com/hasya-vyangya-kavita-hindi/ |website = suvicharhindi.com |access-date=April 19, 2019}}</ref> With the commencement of printing of books in local language in the nineteenth century and especially after India's freedom, this grew.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pritam |first=Sarojani |title=51 Shresth Vyang Rachnayen |publisher=Diamond pocket books}}</ref> Many of the works of [[Tulsi Das]], [[Kabir]], [[Munshi Premchand]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Premchand |first1=Munshi |last2=Gopal |first2=Madan |title=My Life and Times |publisher=Roli Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Premchand |first1=Munshi |title=Premchand Ki Amar Kahaniyan}}</ref> village ministrels, [[Harikatha|Hari katha]] singers, poets, Dalit singers and current day stand up Indian comedians incorporate satire, usually ridiculing authoritarians, fundamentalists  and incompetent people in power.<ref name=\"modisong\">{{cite web |last1=Shankarji |first1=Sung by |title=The Modi song |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh3mlMAkXrE |website=Rough cut productions |publisher=Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan |accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Kunal Kamra: The accidental revolutionary |url=https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/C39AsWWaic7qvGsONZNCnJ/Kunal-Kamra-The-accidental-revolutionary.html |accessdate=April 16, 2019 |newspaper=Live Mint |date=March 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Gujarat Varsity Cancels Show by 'Anti-National' Comedian Kunal Kamra After Alumni Complaint |url=https://thewire.in/humour/kunal-kamra |accessdate=April 16, 2019 |publisher=The Wire}}</ref> In India, it has usually been used as a means of expression and an outlet for common people to express their anger against authoritarian entities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tyagi |first1=Ravindranath |title=Urdu Hindi Hashya Vyang |publisher=Rajkamal Prakashan}}</ref> A popular custom in Northern India of \"Bura na mano Holi hai\" continues, in which comedians on the stage roast local people of importance (who are usually brought in as special guests).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sekhri |first1=Abhinandan |title=Interview with Kunal Kamra |url=https://www.newslaundry.com/ |accessdate=April 19, 2019 |publisher=News laundry |date=April 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Gujarati |first1=Ashok |title=Vyang Ke Rang |publisher=Prabhat Prakashan}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Jaimini |first1=Arun |title=Hasya Vyang Ki Shikhar Kavitaye |isbn=8183615686}}</ref>\n\n===Age of Enlightenment===\n[[File:A Welch wedding. Satire c.1780.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|'A Welch wedding' Satirical Cartoon c.1780]]\n\nThe [[Age of Enlightenment]], an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the [[Tory]] and [[British Whig Party|Whig]] parties\u2014and also, in 1714, by the formation of the [[Scriblerus Club]], which included [[Alexander Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[John Gay]], [[John Arbuthnot]], [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Thomas Parnell]], and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]]. This club included several of the notable satirists of early-18th-century Britain. They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus, \"an invented learned fool... whose work they attributed all that was tedious, narrow-minded, and pedantic in contemporary scholarship\".<ref>{{Citation | title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century | volume = 3 | page = 435}}</ref> In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon. The turn to the 18th century was characterized by a switch from Horatian, soft, pseudo-satire, to biting \"juvenal\" satire.<ref name=\"Weinbrot2007p136\">Weinbrot, Howard D.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=vHADZOHbJ2QC&pg=PA136 p.136]</ref>\n\n[[Jonathan Swift]] was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the \"problem\" of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor. In his book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular. [[John Dryden]] wrote an influential essay entitled \"A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire\"<ref>{{Citation | url = http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/drydendiscourse2.html | editor-first = Jack | editor-last = Lynch | publisher = Rutgers | last = Dryden | first = John | title = Discourse | number = 2}}</ref> that helped fix the definition of satire in the literary world. His satirical ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' was written in response to a rivalry with [[Thomas Shadwell]] and eventually inspired [[Alexander Pope]] to write his satirical ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''. Other satirical works by Pope include the ''[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]''.\n\n[[Alexander Pope]] (b. May 21, 1688) was a satirist known for his Horatian satirist style and translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. Famous throughout and after the [[Long eighteenth century|long 18th century]], Pope died in 1744.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/alexander-pope-9444371#synopsis|title=Biography of Alexander Pope \u00a7 Synopsis|work=Biography.com}}</ref> Pope, in his ''The Rape of the Lock'', is delicately chiding society in a sly but polished voice by holding up a mirror to the follies and vanities of the upper class. Pope does not actively attack the self-important pomp of the British aristocracy, but rather presents it in such a way that gives the reader a new perspective from which to easily view the actions in the story as foolish and ridiculous. A mockery of the upper class, more delicate and lyrical than brutal, Pope nonetheless is able to effectively illuminate the moral degradation of society to the public. ''The Rape of the Lock'' assimilates the masterful qualities of a heroic epic, such as the ''Iliad'', which Pope was translating at the time of writing ''The Rape of the Lock''. However, Pope applied these qualities satirically to a seemingly petty egotistical elitist quarrel to prove his point wryly.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/545/satire-in-18th-century-british-society-alexander-popes-the-rape-of-the-lock-and-jonathan-swifts-a-modest-proposal|title=Satire in 18th Century British Society: Alexander Pope's ''The Rape of the Lock'' and Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal''|year=2011|journal=Student Pulse|volume=3|issue=6|author=Jonathan J.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706\u20131790) and others followed, using satire to shape an emerging nation's culture through its sense of the ridiculous.\n\n===Satire in Victorian England===\n[[File:DV257 no.19 The donkey race.png|thumb|A Victorian satirical sketch depicting a gentleman's donkey race in 1852]]\nSeveral satiric papers competed for the public's attention in the [[Victorian era]] (1837\u20131901) and [[Edwardian]] period, such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (1841) and ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' (1861).\n\nPerhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire, however, are to be found in the [[Savoy Opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. In fact, in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', a jester is given lines that paint a very neat picture of the method and purpose of the satirist, and might almost be taken as a statement of Gilbert's own intent:\n:''\"I can set a braggart quailing with a quip,\n:''The upstart I can wither with a whim;''\n:''He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip,''\n:''But his laughter has an echo that is grim!\"\n\nNovelists such as [[Charles Dickens]] (1812-1870) often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues.\n\nContinuing the tradition of Swiftian journalistic satire, [[Sidney Godolphin Osborne]] (1808-1889) was the most prominent writer of scathing \"Letters to the Editor\" of the [[London Times]]. Famous in his day, he is now all but forgotten. His maternal grandfather [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland]] was considered to be a possible candidate for the authorship of the [[Junius]] letters. If this were true, we can read Osborne as following in his grandfather's satiric \"Letters to the Editor\" path. Osborne's satire was so bitter and biting that at one point he received a public censure from [[Parliament]]'s then Home Secretary Sir [[James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose|James Graham]]. Osborne wrote mostly in the Juvenalian mode over a wide range of topics mostly centered on British government's and landlords' mistreatment of poor farm workers and field laborers. He bitterly opposed the [[New Poor Laws]] and was passionate on the subject of Great Britain's botched response to the [[Irish Famine]] and its mistreatment of soldiers during the [[Crimean War]].\n\nLater in the nineteenth century, in the United States, [[Mark Twain]] (1835\u20131910) grew to become American's greatest satirist: his novel ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884) is set in the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] South, where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads. His hero, Huck, is a rather simple but goodhearted lad who is ashamed of the \"sinful temptation\" that leads him to help a runaway [[Slavery|slave]]. In fact his conscience, warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in, often bothers him most when he is at his best. He is prepared to do good, believing it to be wrong.\n\nTwain's younger contemporary [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1842\u20131913) gained notoriety as a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], pessimist and black humorist with his dark, bitterly ironic stories, many set during the [[American Civil War]], which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason. Bierce's most famous work of satire is probably ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' (1906), in which the definitions mock cant, [[hypocrisy]] and [[Appeal to tradition|received wisdom]].\n\n===20th-century satire===\n[[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] is considered the first major European satirist since [[Jonathan Swift]].<ref name=\"Knight2004p254\">Knight, Charles A. (2004) ''Literature of Satire'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOfVePSFctgC&pg=PA254 p.254]</ref> In 20th-century literature, satire was used by English authors such as [[Aldous Huxley]] (1930s) and [[George Orwell]] (1940s), which under the inspiration of [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Zamyatin]]'s Russian 1921 novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', made serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe. [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] wrote \u2018Satire attains its greatest significance when a newly evolving class creates an ideology considerably more advanced than that of the ruling class, but has not yet developed to the point where it can conquer it. Herein lies its truly great ability to triumph, its scorn for its adversary and its hidden fear of it. Herein lies its venom, its amazing energy of hate, and quite frequently, its grief, like a black frame around glittering images. Herein lie its contradictions, and its power.\u2019<ref>[[David King (graphic designer)|David King]] & Cathy Porter 'Blood & Laughter: Caricatures from the 1905 Revolution' Jonathan Cape 1983 p.31</ref>  Many social critics of this same time in the United States, such as [[Dorothy Parker]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], used satire as their main weapon, and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that \"one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand [[syllogism]]s\" in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism. Novelist [[Sinclair Lewis]] was known for his satirical stories such as ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' (1920), ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'' (1922), ''[[Elmer Gantry]]'' (1927; dedicated by Lewis to H. L. Menchen), and ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' (1935), and his books often explored and satirized contemporary American values. The film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940) by [[Charlie Chaplin]] is itself a parody of [[Adolf Hitler]]; Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].<ref name=\"ChaplinLager\">Chaplin (1964) ''My Autobiography'', p.392, quotation: {{quotation|Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|Benzino Napaloni and [[Adenoid Hynkel]] in ''The Great Dictator'' (1940).

This baton was also carried by the original [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] magazine, edited by [[Doug Kenney]] and [[Henry Beard]] and featuring blistering satire written by [[Michael O'Donoghue]], [[P.J.

One of the most well-known and controversial British satirists is [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], co-writer and director of ''[[Four Lions]]''.\n\nIn Canada, satire has become an important part of the comedy scene. [[Stephen Leacock]] was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including ''[[CODCO]]'', ''[[The Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[This Is That]]'', and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like ''[[History Bites]]'' present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. [[The Beaverton]] is a Canadian news satire site similar to The Onion. Canadian songwriter [[Nancy White (singer-songwriter)|Nancy White]] uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]].\n\nCartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour. [[Al Capp]]'s satirical [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' was censored in September 1947. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centred on Capp's portrayal of the US Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html |title=Tain't Funny \u2013 ''Time'' |publisher=Time.com |date=September 29, 1947 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}</ref> [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joe McCarthy]], caricatured in his comic strip as \"Simple J. Malarky\". [[Garry Trudeau]], whose [[comic strip]] ''[[Doonesbury]]'' focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character [[Mark Slackmeyer]] lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the \"exquisite agony\" of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage.\n\n[[File:2014- 02 - Obama and Putin, by Ranan Lurie.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Political satire by [[Ranan Lurie]]]]\nLike some literary predecessors, many recent television satires contain strong elements of parody and [[caricature]]; for instance, the popular animated series ''The Simpsons'' and ''South Park'' both parody modern family and social life by taking their assumptions to the extreme; both have led to the creation of similar series. As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors.\n\n[[News satire]] is also a very popular form of contemporary satire, appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself: print (e.g. ''[[The Onion]]'', ''[[Waterford Whispers News]]'', ''[[Private Eye]]''), radio (e.g. ''[[On the Hour]]''), television (e.g. ''[[The Day Today]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', ''[[Brass Eye]]'') and the web (e.g. ''[[Faking News]]'', ''[[El Koshary Today]]'', ''[[Babylon Bee]]'', ''[[The Beaverton]]'', ''[[The Daily Bonnet]]'' and ''[[The Onion]]''). Other satires are on the [[list of satirists and satires]]. Another internet-driven form of satire is to lampoon bad internet performers. An example of this is the [[Internet meme]] character [[Miranda Sings]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Ng | first = David | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/05/miranda-sings-colleen-ballinger-jim-caruso-cast-party-jersey-boys-daniel-reichard.html | title = YouTube sensation Miranda seduces Broadway | journal = Los Angeles Times | date = May 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/04/PKGE19REP8.DTL | title = This Week | journal = San Francisco Chronicle | date = October 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Wikinews]]'', Sean Mills, President of ''[[The Onion]]'', said angry letters about their news parody always carried the same message. \"It's whatever affects that person\", said Mills. \"So it's like, 'I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape, but if you talk about cancer, well my brother has cancer and that's not funny to me.'

Because satire often combines anger and humor, as well as the fact that it addresses and calls into question many controversial issues, it can be profoundly disturbing.\n\n===Typical arguments===\nBecause it is essentially ironic or sarcastic, satire is often misunderstood. A typical misunderstanding is to confuse the satirist with his [[persona]].<ref name=\"Test1991p10\"/>\n\n====Bad taste====\nCommon uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion (accusations of [[Taste (sociology)|poor taste]], or that \"it's just not funny\" for instance) and the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas, policies, or people he is attacking. For instance, at the time of its publication, many people misunderstood Swift's purpose in ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism.\n\n====Targeting the victim====\nSome critics of [[Mark Twain]] see [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (novel)|''Huckleberry Finn'']] as [[racist]] and offensive, missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire (racism being in fact only one of a number of Mark Twain's known concerns attacked in ''Huckleberry Finn'').<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Leonard | first1 = James S | first2 = Thomas A | last2 = Tenney | first3 = Thadious M | last3 = Davis | title = Satire or Evasion?: Black Perspectives on Huckleberry Finn | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] |date=December 1992 | page = 224 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fdrBtpSSCisC&pg=RA1-PA116&lpg=RA1-PA116&dq=hemingway+%22huckleberry+finn%22+%22green+hills%22 | isbn = 978-0-8223-1174-4}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Shelley Fisher | last = Fishin | title = Lighting out for the Territory: Reflections on Mark Twain and American Culture | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997}}</ref> This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]''. The character of [[Alf Garnett]] (played by [[Warren Mitchell]]) was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow-minded, racist, [[little Englander]] that Garnett represented. Instead, his character became a sort of [[anti-hero]] to people who actually agreed with his views. (The same situation occurred with [[Archie Bunker]] in American TV show ''[[All in the Family]]'', a character derived directly from Garnett.)\n\nThe Australian satirical television comedy show ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'' has suffered repeated attacks based on various perceived interpretations of the \"target\" of its attacks. The \"Make a Realistic Wish Foundation\" sketch (June 2009), which attacked in classical satiric fashion the heartlessness of people who are reluctant to donate to [[Charitable organization|charities]], was widely interpreted as an attack on the [[Make a Wish Foundation]], or even the terminally ill children helped by that organisation. [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the time [[Kevin Rudd]] stated that The Chaser team \"should hang their heads in shame\". He went on to say that \"I didn't see that but it's been described to me. ...But having a go at kids with a terminal illness is really beyond the pale, absolutely beyond the pale.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/04/2589532.htm |title='Hang your heads' Rudd tells Chaser boys | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}</ref> Television station management suspended the show for two weeks and reduced the third season to eight episodes.\n\n====Romantic prejudice====\nThe romantic prejudice against satire is the belief spread by the [[Romanticism|romantic movement]] that satire is something unworthy of serious attention; this prejudice has held considerable influence to this day.<ref>{{Citation | last = Sutherland | first = James | author-link = James Runcieman Sutherland | year = 1958 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1 | title = English Satire}}</ref> Such prejudice extends to humour and everything that arouses laughter, which are often underestimated as frivolous and unworthy of serious study.<ref>{{Citation | first = Rod A | last = Martin | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ieAcp2Z_zkIC&pg=PA27 | title = The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach | pages = 27\u20138| isbn = 9780080465999 }}</ref> For instance, humor is generally neglected as a topic of anthropological research and teaching.<ref>{{Citation | last = Apte | first = Mahadev L | year = 1985 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4fuAAAAAMAAJ | title = Humor and laughter: an anthropological approach | chapter = Introduction | page = 23 | quote = The general neglect of humor as a topic of anthropological research is reflected in teaching practice.

Periodically, however, it runs into serious opposition, and people in power who perceive themselves as attacked attempt to censor it or prosecute its practitioners. In a classic example, [[Aristophanes]] was persecuted by the [[demagogue]] [[Cleon]].\n\n====1599 book ban====\nIn 1599, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]] and the [[Bishop of London]] [[Richard Bancroft]], whose offices had the function of licensing books for publication in [[England]], issued a decree banning verse satire. The decree, now known as the [[Bishops' Ban of 1599]], ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]], and others; it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queen's [[Privy Council]], and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse.<ref>{{Citation | title = A Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London, 1554\u20131640 | volume = III | editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Arber | location = London | year = 1875\u201394 | page = 677 }}</ref>\n\nThe motives for the ban are obscure, particularly since some of the books banned had been licensed by the same authorities less than a year earlier. Various scholars have argued that the target was obscenity, libel, or sedition. It seems likely that lingering anxiety about the [[Martin Marprelate]] controversy, in which the bishops themselves had employed satirists, played a role; both [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]], two of the key figures in that controversy, suffered a complete ban on all their works. In the event, though, the ban was little enforced, even by the licensing authority itself.\n\n====21st-century polemics====\nIn 2005, the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] caused global protests by offended Muslims and violent attacks with many [[wikt:fatality|fatalities]] in the [[Near East]]. It was not the first case of [[Muslim]] protests against criticism in the form of satire, but the Western world was surprised by the hostility of the reaction: Any country's flag in which a newspaper chose to publish the parodies was being burnt in a Near East country, then embassies were attacked, killing 139 people in mainly four countries; politicians throughout Europe agreed that satire was an aspect of the [[freedom of speech]], and therefore to be a protected means of dialogue. Iran threatened to start an [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition]], which was immediately responded to by Jews with an [[Israeli Anti-Semitic Cartoons Contest]].\n\nIn 2006 British comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] released ''[[Borat|Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', a \"[[mockumentary]]\" that satirized everyone, from high society to frat boys. The film was criticized by many. Although Baron Cohen is Jewish, some complained that it was [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], and the government of [[Kazakhstan]] boycotted the film. The film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian.\n\nIn 2008, popular South African cartoonist and satirist [[Jonathan Shapiro]] (who is published under the pen name Zapiro) came under fire for depicting then-president of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] [[Jacob Zuma]] in the act of undressing in preparation for the implied rape of 'Lady Justice' which is held down by Zuma loyalists.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-12-18-zuma-claims-r7m-over-zapiro-cartoon| work = Mail and Guardian | date = December 18, 2008 | location = [[South Africa|ZA]] | title= Zuma claims R7m over Zapiro cartoon}}</ref> The cartoon was drawn in response to Zuma's efforts to duck corruption charges, and the controversy was heightened by the fact that Zuma was himself acquitted of [[Jacob Zuma rape trial|rape]] in May 2006.

In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], I-90 extends {{convert|385.88|mi|2}} from the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] at [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line at [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]], and is the second-longest highway in the state after [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]]. Although most of the route is part of the tolled [[New York State Thruway]], two non-tolled sections exist along I-90 (the first, situated outside of Buffalo, is included in the Thruway system; the second, situated in the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], is not part of the Thruway system and links [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and its eastern suburbs). Within New York, I-90 has a complete set of auxiliary Interstates, which means that there are interstates numbered [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] through [[Interstate 990|I-990]] in the state, with no gaps in between. For most of its length in New York, I-90 runs parallel to the former [[Erie Canal]] route, [[New York State Route&nbsp;5]] (NY&nbsp;5), [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20) and the [[CSX]] railroad mainline that traverses the state.\n\nI-90 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. In New York, it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany, from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that bypassed the [[Berkshire Connector]] to the north. Ultimately, the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in [[Schodack, New York|Schodack]], and I-90 was assigned to the segment of the Connector east of the proposed freeway. The Albany\u2013Schodack freeway was completed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s and fully open by 1977.\n\n== Route description ==\n\n=== New York State Thruway ===\n{{Main|New York State Thruway#Mainline|l1=New York State Thruway (mainline)}}\nWest of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], I-90 in New York is designated along the mainline of the [[New York State Thruway]]. The Thruway begins at the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], following the shore of [[Lake Erie]] northeast and passes through the town of [[Cheektowaga, New York|Cheektowaga]], a large [[suburb]] of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] directly east of the city. Two auxiliary routes, [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] (leading to [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and connecting into Canada as [[Ontario Highway 405]]) and [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]] (a northerly bypass of Buffalo) connect with I-90 here. Both auxiliary routes provide access between I-90 and Canada's largest city, [[Toronto]]. East of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], the Thruway turns east and passes through the suburbs of several major cities in [[Upstate New York]], generally following the path of the [[Erie Canal]]. It passes south of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and north of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], which are served by three auxiliary Interstate Highways: [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] and [[Interstate 390|I-390]] connect to Rochester, while [[Interstate 690|I-690]] leads to Syracuse.<ref name=\"2009map\">{{cite map |title=New York State Map |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |year=2009 |cartography=[[Map Works]]}}</ref>  The speed limit, enforced by the [[New York State Police]], is 65 miles per hour along most of this stretch.<ref name=\"speedlimit\">{{cite web|title=History of NY Thruway 1991\u20132000|url=http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|accessdate=June 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815074637/http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|archive-date=August 15, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:I-90 west in West Seneca NY.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching exit&nbsp;54 on I-90 westbound in West Seneca]]\nEast of Syracuse, the Thruway follows the Erie Canal and, later, the [[Mohawk River]] into the [[Mohawk Valley]] toward [[Utica, New York|Utica]], where I-90 skirts the northern edge of downtown and meets [[Interstate 790|I-790]], a short route leading into the city's center. Farther east, the freeway indirectly serves the canal and riverside cities of [[Little Falls (city), New York|Little Falls]] (via [[New York State Route 169|NY&nbsp;169]]) and [[Amsterdam (city), New York|Amsterdam]] ([[New York State Route 30|NY&nbsp;30]]) on its way to [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], where [[Interstate 890|I-890]] splits from the Thruway and serves as the connection to the city center. It rejoins I-90 in [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]], where I-90 leaves the mainline of the Thruway at exit&nbsp;24 in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], which is signed for I-87 north and I-90 east. Here, the route designation of the Thruway changes from I-90 east to I-87 south. Traffic intending to continue on I-90 or reach I-87 north must exit the Thruway here.

In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], I-90 extends {{convert|385.88|mi|2}} from the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] at [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line at [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]], and is the second-longest highway in the state after [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]]. Although most of the route is part of the tolled [[New York State Thruway]], two non-tolled sections exist along I-90 (the first, situated outside of Buffalo, is included in the Thruway system; the second, situated in the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], is not part of the Thruway system and links [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and its eastern suburbs). Within New York, I-90 has a complete set of auxiliary Interstates, which means that there are interstates numbered [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] through [[Interstate 990|I-990]] in the state, with no gaps in between. For most of its length in New York, I-90 runs parallel to the former [[Erie Canal]] route, [[New York State Route&nbsp;5]] (NY&nbsp;5), [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20) and the [[CSX]] railroad mainline that traverses the state.\n\nI-90 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. In New York, it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany, from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that bypassed the [[Berkshire Connector]] to the north. Ultimately, the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in [[Schodack, New York|Schodack]], and I-90 was assigned to the segment of the Connector east of the proposed freeway. The Albany\u2013Schodack freeway was completed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s and fully open by 1977.\n\n== Route description ==\n\n=== New York State Thruway ===\n{{Main|New York State Thruway#Mainline|l1=New York State Thruway (mainline)}}\nWest of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], I-90 in New York is designated along the mainline of the [[New York State Thruway]]. The Thruway begins at the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], following the shore of [[Lake Erie]] northeast and passes through the town of [[Cheektowaga, New York|Cheektowaga]], a large [[suburb]] of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] directly east of the city. Two auxiliary routes, [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] (leading to [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and connecting into Canada as [[Ontario Highway 405]]) and [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]] (a northerly bypass of Buffalo) connect with I-90 here. Both auxiliary routes provide access between I-90 and Canada's largest city, [[Toronto]]. East of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], the Thruway turns east and passes through the suburbs of several major cities in [[Upstate New York]], generally following the path of the [[Erie Canal]]. It passes south of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and north of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], which are served by three auxiliary Interstate Highways: [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] and [[Interstate 390|I-390]] connect to Rochester, while [[Interstate 690|I-690]] leads to Syracuse.<ref name=\"2009map\">{{cite map |title=New York State Map |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |year=2009 |cartography=[[Map Works]]}}</ref>  The speed limit, enforced by the [[New York State Police]], is 65 miles per hour along most of this stretch.<ref name=\"speedlimit\">{{cite web|title=History of NY Thruway 1991\u20132000|url=http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|accessdate=June 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815074637/http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|archive-date=August 15, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:I-90 west in West Seneca NY.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching exit&nbsp;54 on I-90 westbound in West Seneca]]\nEast of Syracuse, the Thruway follows the Erie Canal and, later, the [[Mohawk River]] into the [[Mohawk Valley]] toward [[Utica, New York|Utica]], where I-90 skirts the northern edge of downtown and meets [[Interstate 790|I-790]], a short route leading into the city's center.
