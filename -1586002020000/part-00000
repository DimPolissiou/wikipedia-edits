He noted that because there was no room to bury the dead, bodies were left stacked in the open. Funeral rites were often left unattended to, and the entire city smelled like the dead.<ref>Procopius: The Plague, 542</ref> In his ''[[Procopius#Secret History|Secret History]],'' he records the devastation in the countryside and reports the ruthless response by the hard-pressed Justinian:\n\n<blockquote>When pestilence swept through the whole known world and notably the Roman Empire, wiping out most of the farming community and of necessity leaving a trail of desolation in its wake, Justinian showed no mercy towards the ruined freeholders. Even then, he did not refrain from demanding the annual tax, not only the amount at which he assessed each individual, but also the amount for which his deceased neighbors were liable.<ref name=anekdota>Procopius, ''Anekdota'', 23.20f.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nAs a result of the plague in the countryside, farmers could not take care of crops and the price of grain rose in Constantinople. Justinian had expended huge amounts of money for wars against the [[Vandals]] in the region of [[Carthage]] and the [[Ostrogoths]]' [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|kingdom in Italy]]. He had dedicated significant funds to the construction of great churches, such as [[Hagia Sophia]]. As the empire tried to fund the projects, the plague caused tax revenues to decline through the massive number of deaths and the disruption of agriculture and trade. Justinian swiftly enacted new legislation to deal more efficiently with the glut of inheritance suits being brought as a result of victims dying [[intestate]].<ref>Justinian, Edict IX.3; J. Moorhead 1994; Averil Cameron, ''The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity, AD 395\u2013600'', 1993:111.</ref>\n\nThe plague's long-term effects on European and [[Christianity|Christian]] history were enormous. As the disease spread to port cities around the [[Mediterranean]], the struggling [[Goths]] were reinvigorated and [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|their conflict with Constantinople]] entered a new phase. The plague weakened the [[Byzantine Empire]] at a critical point, when Justinian's armies had nearly retaken all of [[Italy]] and the western Mediterranean coast; the evolving conquest would have reunited the core of the [[Western Roman Empire]] with the Eastern Roman Empire. Although the conquest occurred in 554, the reunification did not last long. In 568, the [[Lombards]] invaded [[Northern Italy]], defeated the small Byzantine army that had been left behind and established the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]].<ref name=wade/><ref>Rosen, William.

This structure works as a single photon source.]]\n\nSingle photons are extracted out of a semiconductor by spontaneous emission from the decay of a single excitation. Inside the cavity spontaneous emission is increased due to the [[Purcell effect]].<ref name=\"Eisaman\" /> The challenge in making in a single photon source is to make sure that there is only one excited state in the system at a time. To do that, a quantum dot is placed in a microcavity (Fig. 1). A quantum dot has discrete energy levels. An excitation from its ground state to an excited state will create an exciton. The eventual decay of this exciton due to spontaneous emission will result in the emission of a single photon. DBR's are placed in the cavity to achieve a well-defined spatial mode and to reduce [[Spectral line#Line broadening and shift|linewidth broadening]] due to the lifetime <math>\\Delta t</math> of the excited state (see Fig. 2).\n\n[[File:Linewidth.png|thumb|250px|Figure 2: The decay of a linewidth broadened excited state results in the emission of a photon of frequency \u0127\u03c9. The linewidth broadening is a result of the finite lifetime of the excited state.]]\n\nThe system can then be approximated by the [[Jaynes-Cummings model]]. In this model, the quantum dot only interacts with one single mode of the optical cavity. The frequency of the optical mode is well defined. This makes the photons indistinguishable if their [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] is aligned by a [[polarizer]]. The solution of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian is a [[vacuum Rabi oscillation]]. A vacuum Rabi oscillation of a photon interacting with an exciton is known as an [[exciton-polaritons|exciton-polariton]].\n\nTo eliminate the probability of the simultaneous emission of two photons it has to be made sure that there can only be one exciton in the cavity at one time. The discrete energy states in a quantum dot allow only one excitation. Additionally, the Rydberg blockade prevents the excitation of two excitons at the same space...<ref name=\" Kazimierczuk \">\n{{cite journal\n |author1= T. Kazimierczuk\n |author2= D.

Two excitons confined in a small volume are called [[biexciton]]s. They interact with each other and thus slightly change their energy. Photons resulting from the decay of biexcitons have a different energy than photons resulting from the decay of excitons.

The DBR's can be grown by [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE). For the mirrors two materials with different [[refractive index|indices of refraction]] are grown in alternate order. Their lattice parameters should match to prevent strain. A possible combination is a combination of [[aluminum arsenide]] and [[gallium arsenide]]-layers.<ref name=\"On demand Photons\" /> A material with smaller [[band gap]] is used to grow the quantum dot. In the first few atomic layers of growing this material, the lattice constant will match that of the DBR. A tensile strain appears. At a certain thickness, the energy of the strain becomes too big and the layer contracts to grow with its own lattice constant. At this point, quantum dots have formed naturally. The second layer of DBR's can now be grown on top of the layer with the quantum dots.\n\nThe diameter of the pillar is only a few microns wide.

This structure works as a single photon source.]]\n\nSingle photons are extracted out of a semiconductor by spontaneous emission from the decay of a single excitation. Inside the cavity spontaneous emission is increased due to the [[Purcell effect]].<ref name=\"Eisaman\" /> The challenge in making in a single photon source is to make sure that there is only one excited state in the system at a time. To do that, a quantum dot is placed in a microcavity (Fig. 1). A quantum dot has discrete energy levels. An excitation from its ground state to an excited state will create an exciton. The eventual decay of this exciton due to spontaneous emission will result in the emission of a single photon. DBR's are placed in the cavity to achieve a well-defined spatial mode and to reduce [[Spectral line#Line broadening and shift|linewidth broadening]] due to the lifetime <math>\\Delta t</math> of the excited state (see Fig. 2).\n\n[[File:Linewidth.png|thumb|250px|Figure 2: The decay of a linewidth broadened excited state results in the emission of a photon of frequency \u0127\u03c9. The linewidth broadening is a result of the finite lifetime of the excited state.]]\n\nThe system can then be approximated by the [[Jaynes-Cummings model]]. In this model, the quantum dot only interacts with one single mode of the optical cavity. The frequency of the optical mode is well defined. This makes the photons indistinguishable if their [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] is aligned by a [[polarizer]]. The solution of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian is a [[vacuum Rabi oscillation]]. A vacuum Rabi oscillation of a photon interacting with an exciton is known as an [[exciton-polaritons|exciton-polariton]].\n\nTo eliminate the probability of the simultaneous emission of two photons it has to be made sure that there can only be one exciton in the cavity at one time. The discrete energy states in a quantum dot allow only one excitation. Additionally, the Rydberg blockade prevents the excitation of two excitons at the same space...<ref name=\" Kazimierczuk \">\n{{cite journal\n |author1= T. Kazimierczuk\n |author2= D.

If the energy of the pump laser is turned on resonance, the second exciton cannot be created.\nStill, there is a small probability of having two excitations in the quantum dot at the same time. Two excitons confined in a small volume are called [[biexciton]]s. They interact with each other and thus slightly change their energy. Photons resulting from the decay of biexcitons have a different energy than photons resulting from the decay of excitons. They can be filtered out by letting the outgoing beam pass an [[optical filter]].<ref name=\"Gold\" /> \nThe quantum dots can be excited both electrically and optically.<ref name=\"Eisaman\" /> For optical pumping, a pulsed [[laser]] can be used for excitation of the quantum dots.

However, this way the emitted photons have the same frequency as the pump laser. A polarizer is needed to distinguish between them.<ref name=\"On demand Photons\" /> As the direction of polarization of the photons from the cavity is random, half of the emitted photons are blocked by this filter.\n\n== Experimental realization ==\nA microcavity with only a single quantum dot in it is built. The DBR's can be grown by [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE). For the mirrors two materials with different [[refractive index|indices of refraction]] are grown in alternate order. Their lattice parameters should match to prevent strain. A possible combination is a combination of [[aluminum arsenide]] and [[gallium arsenide]]-layers.<ref name=\"On demand Photons\" /> A material with smaller [[band gap]] is used to grow the quantum dot. In the first few atomic layers of growing this material, the lattice constant will match that of the DBR. A tensile strain appears. At a certain thickness, the energy of the strain becomes too big and the layer contracts to grow with its own lattice constant. At this point, quantum dots have formed naturally. The second layer of DBR's can now be grown on top of the layer with the quantum dots.\n\nThe diameter of the pillar is only a few microns wide. To prevent the optical mode from exiting the cavity the micropillar must act as a waveguide. Semiconductors usually have relatively high indices of refraction about n\u22453.<ref name=\"refraction\">{{cite journal|last1=Herve|first1=P.|last2=Vandamme|first2=L. K.

After aligning the polarization of the photons, their indistinguishability can be measured. For that, the [[Hong-Ou-Mandel effect]] is used. Two photons of the source are prepared so that they enter a 50:50 [[beam splitter]] at the same time from the two different input channels. A [[photodetector|detector]] is placed on both exits of the beam splitter. Coincidences between the two detectors are measured.
