Thistle have won the [[Scottish Cup]] and the [[Scottish League Cup]] in 1921 and 1971 respectively.\n\nThe club are currently managed by [[Ian McCall (footballer)|Ian McCall]] in his second spell in charge. Under [[Alan Archibald]]'s management, the club achieved promotion to the newly formed Scottish Premiership in 2013, and remained there for five consecutive seasons. During this spell Thistle secured major investment and in 2017 finished in the top six of Scottish football for the first time in over three decades. Key players such as club legend [[Kris Doolan]] broke numerous records and became one of the club\u2019s top goal scorers. Despite relegation in the [[2017\u201318 Scottish Premiership]] season, Archibald remained as Thistle's manager. However, after a poor start to the [[2018\u201319 Scottish Championship]] campaign Archibald's 5 year tenure came to an end.

The club's first recorded match (and victory) took place in February against a local junior team, named Valencia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ptearlyyears.net/1870s/1875-76 |title=1875\u201376 \u2013 Partick Thistle history \u2013 The Early Years |publisher=Ptearlyyears.net |date= |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> The location of this match, and thereby Thistle's first home ground, was recorded as 'Overnewton Park', which is thought to have been located next to Overnewton Road, just south of [[Kelvingrove Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ptearlyyears.net/grounds1/overnewton |title=Overnewton \u2013 Partick Thistle grounds \u2013 The Early Years |publisher=Ptearlyyears.net |date= |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> In 1891, Partick Thistle joined the [[Scottish Football Alliance]], one of several competitions set up immediately after the formation of the [[Scottish Football League]] in 1890. The club won the Second Division championship in 1897 and were elected to the First Division. The following season they were re-elected after finishing in eighth place. In 1900 they were elected back to the top level, having finished as Second Division champions again, but were relegated the following season and then promoted in second place in 1902. This would be the last time Thistle changed their division for almost 70 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Partick Thistle \u2013 Background|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Partick_Thistle/Partick_Thistle.htm|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|publisher=Partick Thistle History Archive|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref> Since joining the Scottish professional leagues in 1893, Thistle had been an unpredictable side, spending four years in the First Division and five in the Second, winning promotion three times.

SPL guidelines at the time stipulated that clubs would only be eligible for promotion to the league if their stadium had a minimum 10,000 seated capacity. To comply with these guidelines the terraced section at the north end of Firhill was replaced with a 2000-seat stand.

The club have been members of the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] (SPFL) since its formation in 2013. Thistle currently compete in the [[Scottish Championship]], the second tier of the SPFL structure, following relegation via play-offs from the [[Scottish Premiership]] in the 2017\u201318 season.  \n\nSince 1936, Thistle have played in their distinctive red-and-yellow jerseys of varying designs, with hoops, stripes and predominantly yellow tops with red trims having been used, although in 2009 a centenary kit was launched in the original navy-blue style to commemorate 100 years at Firhill.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vassallo|first1=Jean|last2=Paul|title=Partick Thistle Centenary Kits Launched|url=http://www.football-shirts.co.uk/fans/partick-thistle-centenary-kits-launched_5186|website=www.football-shirts.co.uk|publisher=Football Shirts News|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref> Since 1908 the club have won the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Scottish Second Division]] once and the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] (second tier, now the [[Scottish Championship]]) six times, most recently in 2013. Thistle have won the [[Scottish Cup]] and the [[Scottish League Cup]] in 1921 and 1971 respectively.\n\nThe club are currently managed by [[Ian McCall (footballer)|Ian McCall]] in his second spell in charge. Under [[Alan Archibald]]'s management, the club achieved promotion to the newly formed Scottish Premiership in 2013, and remained there for five consecutive seasons. During this spell Thistle secured major investment and in 2017 finished in the top six of Scottish football for the first time in over three decades. Key players such as club legend [[Kris Doolan]] broke numerous records and became one of the club\u2019s top goal scorers. Despite relegation in the [[2017\u201318 Scottish Premiership]] season, Archibald remained as Thistle's manager. However, after a poor start to the [[2018\u201319 Scottish Championship]] campaign Archibald's 5 year tenure came to an end. He returned to the club as McCall's assistant in 2019.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years===\n[[File:Partick Thistle FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Partick Thistle in the Scottish football league.]] Partick Thistle Football Club was formed in 1876 in the burgh of [[Partick]], which was at that time administratively independent of Glasgow (Partick was not subsumed into Glasgow until 1912).

The club won the Second Division championship in 1897 and were elected to the First Division. The following season they were re-elected after finishing in eighth place. In 1900 they were elected back to the top level, having finished as Second Division champions again, but were relegated the following season and then promoted in second place in 1902. This would be the last time Thistle changed their division for almost 70 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Partick Thistle \u2013 Background|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Partick_Thistle/Partick_Thistle.htm|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|publisher=Partick Thistle History Archive|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref> Since joining the Scottish professional leagues in 1893, Thistle had been an unpredictable side, spending four years in the First Division and five in the Second, winning promotion three times.

In 1897 they moved to [[Meadowside]], where they played until 1908. After being homeless for over a season, they moved to their present home, [[Firhill Stadium]], in the [[Maryhill]] district of [[Glasgow]].

SPL guidelines at the time stipulated that clubs would only be eligible for promotion to the league if their stadium had a minimum 10,000 seated capacity. To comply with these guidelines the terraced section at the north end of Firhill was replaced with a 2000-seat stand. Speaking in 2004, Thistle chairman Tom Hughes argued the club did not at the time require a stadium with such a large capacity and building the new stand 'seriously affected [their] competitiveness'.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/partick_thistle/3508548.stm Hughes Court Warning to SPL]\".

In 1999, he resigned from office over the allegations of certificate forgery. He was later convicted of certificate forgery and sentenced to two years in prison with an option of fine. He paid the fine and was later pardoned by President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].\n\n==Political Career==\nBuhari had been a businessman. In 1999, Buhari was the speaker of the [[House of Representatives (Nigeria)|Nigeria House of Representatives]], which placed him in the 4th highest office in Nigeria. However, this only lasted for six weeks before his [[University of Toronto]] scandal and the beginning of what was known as the University of Toronto Saga. The scandal ultimately led to his resignation and prosecution.\n\n==Controversies==\nThe news of his age and certificate forgery first broke out on 16 February 1999 by an investigative news publication, [[TheNews magazine]]. Their investigation concluded that Buhari was born in 1970 and not 1963 as he claimed, and also that he did not graduate from the University of Toronto. The article published about the speaker dispelled that the speaker did not attended the university, not to talk of graduating. Section 65(1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria disqualifies anyone below the age of 30 from running for membership of the House of Representatives.\n\nBuhari had also claimed that he completed his '''[[National Youth Service Corps|National Youth Service]]''' at Standard Construction in [[Kano]] which was also not true, as his name could not be found on any record in the list of those who completed the scheme. When Buhari was confronted with multiple allegations about his declaration and falsification, he promptly responded accusing the publications as an attack on him and proclaims his innocence and threatened to file a lawsuit against the publisher for libel. His confidence and response to the allegations were very assertive in nature and quite convincing that he was a victim of a witch-hunt. The magazine had written to the University of Toronto, requesting confirmation that Buhari was an alumnus. In response, Carlo Villanueva, an official of the Institution wrote, \u201c''Regarding your request for confirmation of degree for Mr Ibrahim Salisu Buhari.
