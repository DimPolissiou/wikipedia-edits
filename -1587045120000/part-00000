The case was then analyzed by the Supreme Military Court. The [[General]] in charge of reporting the case voted for his acquittal, arguing that Bolsonaro had already been penalized for the initial article in ''Veja'', that there was no testimonial evidence of his plans to plant bombs and that there were \"deep contradictions in the four graphological exams\", two of which failed to conclude that Bolsonaro was indeed the author of the sketches. He ended up acquitted by the majority of the court (9{{nbsp}}x 4{{nbsp}}votes). In December 1988, just after this ruling, Bolsonaro left the Army to begin his political career.

The case was then analyzed by the Supreme Military Court.

We need to adopt a rigid birth control policy. We can't make demagogic speeches any longer, proposing bills and means of government to support these poor people [who] are increasingly proliferating throughout the country. [...] People who aren't prepared to have children, shouldn't have them. This is what I stand for and I'm not worried about getting votes in the future. It's past time to discuss a policy to contain this demographic explosion, otherwise, we'll keep voting in this [[Chamber of Deputies|Chamber]] only matters such as [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]], loans for the poor, gas vouchers, etc. Methods [of birth control] have to be provided for those who, unfortunately, are ignorant and have no means to control their offspring.

It is also the entrance to [[Oxford Circus tube station]].\n\nThe junction opened in 1819 as part of the Regent Street development under [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], and was originally known as '''Regent Circus North'''. After the original lease expired, it was redesigned around a series of four quadrant buildings by [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]] between 1913 and 1928, the northeast of which has been used by [[Peter Robinson (department store)|Peter Robinson]], [[Topshop]], the [[BBC]] and the [[London Co-operative Society]]; these are now [[listed building|Grade II listed]]. Oxford Circus remains a busy junction for traffic, and a \u00a35&nbsp;million upgrade for pedestrians opened in 2009. It has also attracted attention as a place for demonstrations and protests, including [[Extinction Rebellion]].\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\n[[File:Oxford Circus (22891646886).jpg|thumb|Oxford Circus in 1904, showing [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s original design]]\nThe junction was designed as part of [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s work on [[Regent Street]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=685}} Circuses had become popular in English architecture after [[George Dance the Younger]] had popularised them in the [[Minories]] in East London. Nash wanted to use extra land space so that vehicles could move around one another when turning, with a concave layout attracting shopkeepers and increasing the potential for land value. He originally intended the circus to be [[colonnade]]d, but when the New Street Bill was proposed to parliament, it was rejected, with one MP fearing the circus would \"be a nuisance by day and something worse by night\".{{sfn|Bartlett|p=1}} He redesigned the circus so that the new Regent Street would meet the established Oxford Street at a near right-angle, with a smaller {{convert|164|ft|adj=on}} diameter reducing its land intake.  Parliament approved the design in 1813.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=2}}\n\nConstruction of the circus began in 1816, with Nash working in association with Samuel Baxter. Work was complicated by the [[compulsory purchase]] of properties along Oxford Street. Eight houses on the north side and eleven on the south were demolished to make way for the junction.{{sfn|Bartlett|pp=3\u20134}} To avoid legal challenges, Nash attempted to rehouse existing tenants in the new buildings around the circus wherever possible. After John Richardson, proprietor of Richardson's silk shop on 118 Oxford Street died, Nash ensured his widow and surviving family and employees were all housed in a building on the circus' northeast section. After the family complained and demanded changes, Nash worked with Baxter to try and accommodate them as much as possible.{{sfn|Bartlett|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nMost buildings around the circus were designed in a more disciplined manner than some of Nash's later work, and were based on [[Palladian architecture]]. They featured fluted [[Corinthian order]] pilasters and artificial stone capitals. The pilaster order continued down Regent Street.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=7}}\n\nThe circus opened officially in November 1819.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=3}} It was originally known as Regent Circus North, with the corresponding [[Piccadilly Circus]] named Regent Circus South.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=685}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=The rebuilding of Piccadilly Circus and the Regent Street Quadrant|work=Survey of London|volume=31 and 32, St James Westminster, Part 2|editor=F H W Sheppard|location=London|year=1963|pp=85\u2013100|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols31-2/pt2/pp85-100|accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref> However, unlike Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus had no decorations and was designed as a straightforward traffic crossing.{{sfn|Glinert|2008|p=88}} Fellow architect [[James Elmes]] described Nash's work on the circus as giving \"an air of grandeur\" and \"as elegant in form as it is useful in application\".{{sfn|Bartlett|p=8}} The current name began to be used around 1836.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=2}}\n\nIn 1842, the MP [[Joseph Hume]] proposed a commemorative [[obelisk]] should be constructed in the middle of the circus.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=8}} Construction began in December 1842, but was quickly disrupted and abandoned after the Marylebone parish [[vestry]] realised they only had authority to clean and maintain the circus, and not to construct anything on top of it. The obelisk was eventually built in 1850 at [[Nunhead Cemetery]] with a slightly different design.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=10}}\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:London Oxford Circus, 1949 geograph-3044387-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|Oxford Circus in 1949]]\nThe lease on the four quadrants around the interchange was due to expire in 1917, and it was determined they would need to be rebuilt. In 1904, the [[Commissioners of Woods and Forests]] outlined a plan to redevelop Regent Street, including Oxford Circus. In 1909, they invited proposals to redevelop the site.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=11}} The new design was awarded to [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]] in October 1910, who saw off several rival designs, and built in stages between 1913 and 1928.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=610}}{{sfn|Bartlett|p=14}} Tanner's design was inspired by 18th-century French architecture, particularly that of [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]].{{sfn|Bartlett|p=15}} Each quadrant was designed to be symmetrical with the others.<ref name=NHLE/>\n\nThe southeastern quadrant was completed first in 1913, before work stopped at the start of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Bartlett|p=16}} The northwest quadrant opened in May 1922 as the London premises for the [[Magasins du Louvre]].

The [[BBC]] requisitioned part of the block and it saw significant use in overseas broadcasting during the war. It was sold to the [[London Co-operative Society]] in 1944.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=18}} Through a series of buyouts and mergers, Peter Robinson became [[Topshop]] which now occupies the site.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=17}} It is the flagship store of the franchise, covering four floors and attracting around 28,000 shoppers a day, half of whom buy something.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/business/worldbusiness/21topshop.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1415214562-edQGoGWtOdP4K7Vcqbj+RA|title=But Will It Play in Manhattan?|newspaper=New York Times|date=21 June 2006|accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe buildings are constructed of [[Portland stone]] with a cladding steel frame and slate roofs.

It is also the entrance to [[Oxford Circus tube station]].\n\nThe junction opened in 1819 as part of the Regent Street development under [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], and was originally known as '''Regent Circus North'''. After the original lease expired, it was redesigned around a series of four quadrant buildings by [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]] between 1913 and 1928, the northeast of which has been used by [[Peter Robinson (department store)|Peter Robinson]], [[Topshop]], the [[BBC]] and the [[London Co-operative Society]]; these are now [[listed building|Grade II listed]]. Oxford Circus remains a busy junction for traffic, and a \u00a35 million upgrade for pedestrians opened in 2009. It has also attracted attention as a place for demonstrations and protests, including [[Extinction Rebellion]].\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\n[[File:Oxford Circus (22891646886).jpg|thumb|Oxford Circus in 1904, showing [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s original design]]\nThe junction was designed as part of [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s work on [[Regent Street]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=685}} Circuses had become popular in English architecture after [[George Dance the Younger]] had popularised them in the [[Minories]] in East London. Nash wanted to use extra land space so that vehicles could move around one another when turning, with a concave layout attracting shopkeepers and increasing the potential for land value. He originally intended the circus to be [[colonnade]]d, but when the New Street Bill was proposed to parliament, it was rejected, with one MP fearing the circus would \"be a nuisance by day and something worse by night\".{{sfn|Bartlett|p=1}} He redesigned the circus so that the new Regent Street would meet the established Oxford Street at a near right-angle, with a smaller {{convert|164|ft|adj=on}} diameter reducing its land intake.  Parliament approved the design in 1813.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=2}}\n\nConstruction of the circus began in 1816, with Nash working in association with Samuel Baxter. Work was complicated by the [[compulsory purchase]] of properties along Oxford Street. Eight houses on the north side and eleven on the south were demolished to make way for the junction.{{sfn|Bartlett|pp=3\u20134}} To avoid legal challenges, Nash attempted to rehouse existing tenants in the new buildings around the circus wherever possible. After John Richardson, proprietor of Richardson's silk shop on 118 Oxford Street died, Nash ensured his widow and surviving family and employees were all housed in a building on the circus' northeast section. After the family complained and demanded changes, Nash worked with Baxter to try and accommodate them as much as possible.{{sfn|Bartlett|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nMost buildings around the circus were designed in a more disciplined manner than some of Nash's later work, and were based on [[Palladian architecture]]. They featured fluted [[Corinthian order]] pilasters and artificial stone capitals. The pilaster order continued down Regent Street.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=7}}\n\nThe circus opened officially in November 1819.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=3}} It was originally known as Regent Circus North, with the corresponding [[Piccadilly Circus]] named Regent Circus South.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=685}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=The rebuilding of Piccadilly Circus and the Regent Street Quadrant|work=Survey of London|volume=31 and 32, St James Westminster, Part 2|editor=F H W Sheppard|location=London|year=1963|pp=85\u2013100|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols31-2/pt2/pp85-100|accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref> However, unlike Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus had no decorations and was designed as a straightforward traffic crossing.{{sfn|Glinert|2008|p=88}} Fellow architect [[James Elmes]] described Nash's work on the circus as giving \"an air of grandeur\" and \"as elegant in form as it is useful in application\".{{sfn|Bartlett|p=8}} The current name began to be used around 1836.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=2}}\n\nIn 1842, the MP [[Joseph Hume]] proposed a commemorative [[obelisk]] should be constructed in the middle of the circus.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=8}} Construction began in December 1842, but was quickly disrupted and abandoned after the Marylebone parish [[vestry]] realised they only had authority to clean and maintain the circus, and not to construct anything on top of it. The obelisk was eventually built in 1850 at [[Nunhead Cemetery]] with a slightly different design.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=10}}\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:London Oxford Circus, 1949 geograph-3044387-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|Oxford Circus in 1949]]\nThe lease on the four quadrants around the interchange was due to expire in 1917, and it was determined they would need to be rebuilt. In 1904, the [[Commissioners of Woods and Forests]] outlined a plan to redevelop Regent Street, including Oxford Circus. In 1909, they invited proposals to redevelop the site.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=11}} The new design was awarded to [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]] in October 1910, who saw off several rival designs, and built in stages between 1913 and 1928.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=610}}{{sfn|Bartlett|p=14}} Tanner's design was inspired by 18th-century French architecture, particularly that of [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]].{{sfn|Bartlett|p=15}} Each quadrant was designed to be symmetrical with the others.<ref name=NHLE/> \n\nThe southeastern quadrant was completed first in 1913, before work stopped at the start of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Bartlett|p=16}} The northwest quadrant opened in May 1922 as the London premises for the [[Magasins du Louvre]].

(season 6)|sixth season]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] renewed ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' for a seventh.<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> This early renewal was a surprise following the series' low rated [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 5)|fifth season]],<ref name=\"S7RenewTHR\" /> but ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that this timing was likely due to the cast's contract negotiations and would help reduce costs by filming the sixth and seventh seasons back-to-back.<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> [[Marvel Television]] head [[Jeph Loeb]] later revealed that the series' crew had expected the shorter sixth season to be its last and were also surprised by the seventh season renewal. He attributed the decision to ABC watching early work on season six and believing the crew had found \"another wave of energy\" that they wanted to see continue.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisitMay2019\" /> Responding to new rumors in March 2019 that the seventh season would be the series' last, Loeb stated, \"We're not ending.\"<ref name=\"WonderCon2019\" /> However, ahead of the series [[San Diego Comic-Con]] panel in July 2019, Loeb announced that the seventh season would be the series' last. He explained that the cast and crew had originally expected the series to end with the fifth season, and had put other plans on hold to continue with the sixth. So, when ABC wanted to renew the series for a seventh season, they agreed to the decision if it could be the final season. Having this knowledge allowed them to build the season specifically to \"tie up any threads\" and try to create a satisfying conclusion to the story.<ref name=\"FinalSeason\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nBecause the season was ordered while the writers were working on the sixth season, they and showrunners [[Jed Whedon]], [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], and [[Jeffrey Bell]] were able to plan a story that is split over both seasons with a cliffhanger ending the sixth season that the seventh can resolve.<ref name=\"WonderCon2019WhedonTancharoen\" /> The writers tried to create more episodes in the season that were \"outside of [their] normal form of storytelling\", like the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 3)|third season]] episode \"[[4,722 Hours]]\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisitMay2019\" /> For previous seasons, the writers divided their stories into different \"pods\" rather than stretching a single story over 22 episodes, but this was not necessary for the shorter 13 episode season.<ref name=\"DoGMay2019\" /> The seventh season's story features the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms, a recurring subplot in the sixth season. They use time travel to do this, allowing the season to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. and \"look back at everything we\u2019ve done\". The season begins in 1930s New York, prior to the formation of S.H.I.E.L.D., before exploring more time periods.<ref name=\"EPsPostS6EW\" /><ref name=\"EPsPostS6TVLine\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nWith the season renewal, main cast members [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Chloe Bennet]], [[Iain De Caestecker]], [[Elizabeth Henstridge]], [[Henry Simmons]], [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]], and [[Jeff Ward (actor)|Jeff Ward]] were confirmed to be returning from previous seasons as Melinda May, [[Daisy Johnson|<!-- don't delink -->Daisy Johnson / Quake]], [[Leo Fitz]], [[Jemma Simmons]], [[Al MacKenzie|Alphonso \"Mack\" MacKenzie]], [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez|Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez]], and [[Deke Shaw]], respectively. The renewal did not include series' star [[Clark Gregg]],<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> but Jed Whedon stated in April 2019 that the producers \"firmly believe that any season would have to have him in it\".<ref name=\"WonderCon2019WhedonTancharoen\" /> The end of the sixth season revealed that a [[Life Model Decoy]] of [[Phil Coulson]] would appear in the seventh season, with Gregg starring as the new version of his character.<ref name=\"S7Premise\" /><ref name=\"EPsPostS6EW\" /> This was the writers' solution to wanting to bring the character back without reversing the stakes of his death in the fifth season.<ref name=\"EPsPostS6EW\" />\n\nIn August 2019, [[Hayley Atwell]] and [[Patrick Warburton]] were revealed to be returning to the series for the final season after previously making guest appearances as [[Peggy Carter]] and [[Rick Stoner]], respectively.<ref name=\"Atwell\" /><ref name=\"Warburton\" /> [[Enver Gjokaj]] was also expected to be reprising his role as Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR) agent [[Daniel Sousa (character)|Daniel Sousa]] from the series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'',<ref name=\"Atwell\" /> which was confirmed in April 2020. Whedon and Tancharoen had previously worked with Gjokaj on ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'' and were excited to explore his character further on ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Bell said Sousa would be seen in a \"different light\" in the season. Whedon added that having Sousa allows Coulson, a \"fanboy for S.H.I.E.L.D. history\", to interact with that history.<ref name=\"Gjokaj\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nProduction for the season began at the end of February 2019,<ref name=\"ProductionBegin\" /> in [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=\"TVLineSetVisitMay2019\" /> Filming wrapped on July 30, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionEnd\" />\n\n=== Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins ===\nIn August 2019, Whedon and Tancharoen indicated that there would be a connection to the MCU in the final season.<ref name=\"EPsPostS6TVLine\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe first footage of the season was released in August 2019 at the [[D23 Expo]].<ref name=\"D23Teaser\" /> A new teaser and poster for the season were released to coincide with the season's premiere date announcement in April 2020,<ref name=\"S7PremiereDateMarvel\" /> with the poster featuring an \"old-school\" [[World War II]]-era S.H.I.E.L.D. logo due to the season returning to that era via time travel.<ref name=\"RetroPoster\" />\n\n== Release ==\nThe seventh season is set to begin airing on ABC in the United States on May 27, 2020,<ref name=\"S7PremiereDate\" /> running for 13 episodes.<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /><ref name=\"S72020Release\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"S7Renew\">{{Cite web

(season 6)|sixth season]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] renewed ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' for a seventh.<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> This early renewal was a surprise following the series' low rated [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 5)|fifth season]],<ref name=\"S7RenewTHR\" /> but ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that this timing was likely due to the cast's contract negotiations and would help reduce costs by filming the sixth and seventh seasons back-to-back.<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> [[Marvel Television]] head [[Jeph Loeb]] later revealed that the series' crew had expected the shorter sixth season to be its last and were also surprised by the seventh season renewal. He attributed the decision to ABC watching early work on season six and believing the crew had found \"another wave of energy\" that they wanted to see continue.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisitMay2019\" /> Responding to new rumors in March 2019 that the seventh season would be the series' last, Loeb stated, \"We're not ending.\"<ref name=\"WonderCon2019\" /> However, ahead of the series [[San Diego Comic-Con]] panel in July 2019, Loeb announced that the seventh season would be the series' last. He explained that the cast and crew had originally expected the series to end with the fifth season, and had put other plans on hold to continue with the sixth. So, when ABC wanted to renew the series for a seventh season, they agreed to the decision if it could be the final season. Having this knowledge allowed them to build the season specifically to \"tie up any threads\" and try to create a satisfying conclusion to the story.<ref name=\"FinalSeason\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nBecause the season was ordered while the writers were working on the sixth season, they and showrunners [[Jed Whedon]], [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], and [[Jeffrey Bell]] were able to plan a story that is split over both seasons with a cliffhanger ending the sixth season that the seventh can resolve.<ref name=\"WonderCon2019WhedonTancharoen\" /> The writers tried to create more episodes in the season that were \"outside of [their] normal form of storytelling\", like the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 3)|third season]] episode \"[[4,722 Hours]]\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisitMay2019\" /> For previous seasons, the writers divided their stories into different \"pods\" rather than stretching a single story over 22 episodes, but this was not necessary for the shorter 13 episode season.<ref name=\"DoGMay2019\" /> The seventh season's story features the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms, a recurring subplot in the sixth season. They use time travel to do this, allowing the season to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. and \"look back at everything we\u2019ve done\". The season begins in 1930s New York, prior to the formation of S.H.I.E.L.D., before exploring more time periods.<ref name=\"EPsPostS6EW\" /><ref name=\"EPsPostS6TVLine\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nWith the season renewal, main cast members [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Chloe Bennet]], [[Iain De Caestecker]], [[Elizabeth Henstridge]], [[Henry Simmons]], [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]], and [[Jeff Ward (actor)|Jeff Ward]] were confirmed to be returning from previous seasons as Melinda May, [[Daisy Johnson|<!-- don't delink -->Daisy Johnson / Quake]], [[Leo Fitz]], [[Jemma Simmons]], [[Al MacKenzie|Alphonso \"Mack\" MacKenzie]], [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez|Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez]], and [[Deke Shaw]], respectively. The renewal did not include series' star [[Clark Gregg]],<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> but Jed Whedon stated in April 2019 that the producers \"firmly believe that any season would have to have him in it\".<ref name=\"WonderCon2019WhedonTancharoen\" /> The end of the sixth season revealed that a [[Life Model Decoy]] of [[Phil Coulson]] would appear in the seventh season, with Gregg starring as the new version of his character.<ref name=\"S7Premise\" /><ref name=\"EPsPostS6EW\" /> This was the writers' solution to wanting to bring the character back without reversing the stakes of his death in the fifth season.<ref name=\"EPsPostS6EW\" />\n\nIn August 2019, [[Hayley Atwell]] and [[Patrick Warburton]] were revealed to be returning to the series for the final season after previously making guest appearances as [[Peggy Carter]] and [[Rick Stoner]], respectively.<ref name=\"Atwell\" /><ref name=\"Warburton\" /> [[Enver Gjokaj]] was also expected to be reprising his role as Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR) agent [[Daniel Sousa (character)|Daniel Sousa]] from the series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'',<ref name=\"Atwell\" /> which was confirmed in April 2020. Whedon and Tancharoen had previously worked with Gjokaj on ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'' and were excited to explore his character further on ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Bell said Sousa would be seen in a \"different light\" in the season. Whedon added that having Sousa allows Coulson, a \"fanboy for S.H.I.E.L.D. history\", to interact with that history.<ref name=\"Gjokaj\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nProduction for the season began at the end of February 2019,<ref name=\"ProductionBegin\" /> in [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=\"TVLineSetVisitMay2019\" /> Filming wrapped on July 30, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionEnd\" />\n\n=== Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins ===\nIn August 2019, Whedon and Tancharoen indicated that there would be a connection to the MCU in the final season.<ref name=\"EPsPostS6TVLine\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe first footage of the season was released in August 2019 at the [[D23 Expo]].<ref name=\"D23Teaser\" /> A new teaser and poster for the season were released to coincide with the season's premiere date announcement in April 2020,<ref name=\"S7PremiereDateMarvel\" /> with the poster featuring an \"old-school\" [[World War II]]-era S.H.I.E.L.D. logo due to the season returning to that era via time travel.<ref name=\"RetroPoster\" />\n\n== Release ==\nThe seventh season is set to begin airing on ABC in the United States on May 27, 2020,<ref name=\"S7PremiereDate\" /> running for 13 episodes.<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /><ref name=\"S72020Release\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"S7Renew\">{{Cite web
