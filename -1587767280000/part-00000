''Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey''. New York: Warner Books, 1999.</ref> The chimps would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification that is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking.<ref name=\"Chimp\" /> Humans had long distinguished ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom as \"Man the Toolmaker\". In response to Goodall's revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, \"We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!\".<ref name=\"Chimp\" /><ref>[http://www.janegoodall.org/study-corner-tool-use Tool Use]</ref><ref name=\"Goodall\">The Jane Goodall Institute: [http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp_central/default.asp \"Chimpanzee Central\"], 2008.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as [[colobus]] monkeys.<ref name=\"PBS\" /> Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus.<ref name=\"Goodall\" /> The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours.<ref name=\"Goodall\" /> The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year.<ref name=\"PBS\" /> This alone was a major scientific find that challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBut perhaps more startling, and disturbing, was the tendency for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop to maintain their dominance,<ref name=\"PBS\" /> sometimes going as far as [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]].<ref name=\"Chimp\" /> She says of this revelation, \"During the first ten years of the study I had believed [\u2026] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings. [\u2026] Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal\u2014that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature.\"<ref name=\"Chimp\" /> She described the 1974\u20131978 [[Gombe Chimpanzee War]] in her memoir, ''Through a Window: My Thirty Years with the Chimpanzees of Gombe''. Her findings revolutionised contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee behaviour, and were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nGoodall also set herself apart from the traditional conventions of the time by naming the animals in her studies of primates, instead of assigning each a number. Numbering was a nearly universal practice at the time, and thought to be important in the removal of one's self from the potential for emotional attachment to the subject being studied. Setting herself apart from other researchers also led her to develop a close bond with the chimpanzees and to become, to this day, the only human ever accepted into chimpanzee society.  She was the lowest ranking member of a troop for a period of 22 months.

New York: Warner Books, 1999.</ref> The chimps would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification that is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking.<ref name=\"Chimp\" /> Humans had long distinguished ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom as \"Man the Toolmaker\". In response to Goodall's revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, \"We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!\".<ref name=\"Chimp\" /><ref>[http://www.janegoodall.org/study-corner-tool-use Tool Use]</ref><ref name=\"Goodall\">The Jane Goodall Institute: [http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp_central/default.asp \"Chimpanzee Central\"], 2008.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as [[colobus]] monkeys.<ref name=\"PBS\" /> Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus.<ref name=\"Goodall\" /> The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours.<ref name=\"Goodall\" /> The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year.<ref name=\"PBS\" /> This alone was a major scientific find that challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBut perhaps more startling, and disturbing, was the tendency for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop to maintain their dominance,<ref name=\"PBS\" /> sometimes going as far as [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]].<ref name=\"Chimp\" /> She says of this revelation, \"During the first ten years of the study I had believed [\u2026] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings. [\u2026] Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal\u2014that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature.\"<ref name=\"Chimp\" /> She described the 1974\u20131978 [[Gombe Chimpanzee War]] in her memoir, ''Through a Window: My Thirty Years with the Chimpanzees of Gombe''. Her findings revolutionised contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee behaviour, and were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nGoodall also set herself apart from the traditional conventions of the time by naming the animals in her studies of primates, instead of assigning each a number. Numbering was a nearly universal practice at the time, and thought to be important in the removal of one's self from the potential for emotional attachment to the subject being studied. Setting herself apart from other researchers also led her to develop a close bond with the chimpanzees and to become, to this day, the only human ever accepted into chimpanzee society.  She was the lowest ranking member of a troop for a period of 22 months.

The house was originally intended for two families. The building dated 1386 is one of the oldest buildings in the entire Alpine region and is in itself a gem of Walser architecture. One room is dedicated to the Gurin artist and graphic artist [[Hans Tomamichel]] (1899 \u2013 1984) who is known for his sgraffitis created throughout Switzerland (20 of which are in Bosco/Gurin) and for the important advertising campaigns created for [[Knorr]], [[Nestl\u00e9]] and [[Caritas]]. Hans Tomamichel was also one of the co-founders of the Walserhaus Association and active in making the Walser culture known as a whole.<ref>According to the book by Annegreth Diethelm ''Hans Anton Tomamichel. 1899\u20131984.

For this purpose, the project ''Ggurijnar Cheschtschi'' (Gurin treasure chest) was developed: a collection of didactic activities and guided tours described in a series of brochures that allow to make tangible themes around the traditions, the language, the art and the environment. The borchures are available to visitors at the reception so that they can explore the village and learn some interesting facts about it. The project ''Ggurijnar Cheschtschi'' was supported by Pro Patria and by the Bosco/Gurin Association for the landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walserhaus.ch/bilder/160329/Verbale-assemblea-19-03-2016.pdf.|title=Verbale dell\u2019Assemblea del consuntivo del 19.03.2016 |access-date= April 5, 2020}}</ref>\n \n== The Show-garden and ''M\u00e5tzuf\u00e5mm''==\n\n[[File:Matzufamm.jpeg|thumb| The delicious vegetable soup ''M\u00e5tzuf\u00e5mm''. ]]\n\n{{quote|''Iaschi \u00c5\u00e5na h\u00e8d eistar ggseit, fer an g\u00fcata M\u00e5tzuf\u00e5mm z heigin, m\u00fcassmu zacha S\u00e5cha dret\u00fca'' \u2013 Our grandmother used to say that a good M\u00e5tzuf\u00e5mm-soup needs at least ten different ingredients. |from ''Aus der Mundart von Bosco/Gurin''}}\n\nThe didactic vegetable garden [[ProSpecieRara]] in front of the building is part of the museum in the territory.

The many vegetables grown here are also the ingredients for the traditional soup ''M\u00e5tzuf\u00e5mm''. Some years ago, the original recipe was rediscovered and is now the main attraction of the traditional autumn festival organized in collaboration with the local Traditional costume group. During the festival, there are also free village and museum guided visits, a market with local products and games for children. Yet, it is mainly the delicious vegetable soup served with local bread and cheese which every year attracts not only the villagers, but more and more visitors from Ticino, Switzerland and even from abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://epaper.cooperation.ch/_deploy/CO/20110913/CO60/pdf_noenc/7_26dd3b0acd.pdf.|title=Raafschi, la rapa che toglie la sete|access-date= April 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Projects ==\n\n[[File:Walserhaus Temporary Birds.JPG|thumb| Temporary exhibition ''Ggurijnar Vegalti'' (Gurin birds). ]]\n\nThe Walserhaus Gurin museum is recognized by the Canton of Ticino as a regional ethnographic museum (Law on regional ethnographic museums \u2013 1990.06.18 and chg. 2002.06.04)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www4.ti.ch/decs/dcsu/cde/musei-regionali/musei-regionali-e-coordinamento/ |title= Centro di dialettologia e di etnografia Cantone Ticino|access-date= April 5, 2020}}</ref> and is an active member of the International Association for Walserism (IVfW)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wir-walser.ch/ |title= Internationale Vereinigung f\u00fcr Walsertum|access-date= April 5, 2020}}</ref>.

Mit Bildern schreiben.'' </ref>\n\nIn the two nearby barns there are a permanent exhibition on mountain farming and temporary exhibitions ond topics inherent to the village, whereas in front of the museum there is the show garden built in collaboration with the [[ProSpecieRara]] Foundation. \n\n== The Museum in the Territory ==\n\nThe new concept elaborated in 2016 wants to expand the museum into the Gurin territory. For this purpose, the project ''Ggurijnar Cheschtschi'' (Gurin treasure chest) was developed: a collection of didactic activities and guided tours described in a series of brochures that allow to make tangible themes around the traditions, the language, the art and the environment. The borchures are available to visitors at the reception so that they can explore the village and learn some interesting facts about it. The project ''Ggurijnar Cheschtschi'' was supported by Pro Patria and by the Bosco Gurin Association for the landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walserhaus.ch/bilder/160329/Verbale-assemblea-19-03-2016.pdf.|title=Verbale dell\u2019Assemblea del consuntivo del 19.03.2016 |access-date= April 5, 2020}}</ref>\n \n== The Show-garden and ''M\u00e5tzuf\u00e5mm''==\n\n[[File:Matzufamm.jpeg|thumb| The delicious vegetable soup ''M\u00e5tzuf\u00e5mm''. ]]\n\n{{quote|''Iaschi \u00c5\u00e5na h\u00e8d eistar ggseit, fer an g\u00fcata M\u00e5tzuf\u00e5mm z heigin, m\u00fcassmu zacha S\u00e5cha dret\u00fca'' \u2013 Our grandmother used to say that a good M\u00e5tzuf\u00e5mm-soup needs at least ten different ingredients. |from ''Aus der Mundart von Bosco Gurin''}}\n\nThe didactic vegetable garden [[ProSpecieRara]] in front of the building is part of the museum in the territory. Following the intentions of the Swiss Foundation for preservation and promotion of genetic diversity in fauna and flora, the garden wants to attract the visitors\u2019 attention on old and rare sorts of vegetables, which also include a local May beet variety (''R\u00e5\u00e5fa'', ''Raaftschi'') of Bosco Gurin. The many vegetables grown here are also the ingredients for the traditional soup ''M\u00e5tzuf\u00e5mm''. Some years ago, the original recipe was rediscovered and is now the main attraction of the traditional autumn festival organized in collaboration with the local Traditional costume group. During the festival, there are also free village and museum guided visits, a market with local products and games for children. Yet, it is mainly the delicious vegetable soup served with local bread and cheese which every year attracts not only the villagers, but more and more visitors from Ticino, Switzerland and even from abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://epaper.cooperation.ch/_deploy/CO/20110913/CO60/pdf_noenc/7_26dd3b0acd.pdf.|title=Raafschi, la rapa che toglie la sete|access-date= April 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Projects ==\n\n[[File:Walserhaus Temporary Birds.JPG|thumb| Temporary exhibition ''Ggurijnar Vegalti'' (Gurin birds). ]]\n\nThe Walserhaus Gurin museum is recognized by the Canton of Ticino as a regional ethnographic museum (Law on regional ethnographic museums \u2013 1990.06.18 and chg. 2002.06.04)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www4.ti.ch/decs/dcsu/cde/musei-regionali/musei-regionali-e-coordinamento/ |title= Centro di dialettologia e di etnografia Cantone Ticino|access-date= April 5, 2020}}</ref> and is an active member of the International Association for Walserism (IVfW)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wir-walser.ch/ |title= Internationale Vereinigung f\u00fcr Walsertum|access-date= April 5, 2020}}</ref>.

Estimates of the number of [[native language|native]] and [[second language]] speakers of Macedonian varies; the number of native speakers in the country ranges from 1,344,815 according to the 2002 census in North Macedonia to 1,476,500 per linguistic database ''[[Ethnologue]]'' in 2016. Estimates of the total number of speakers in the world include 3.5 million people. Macedonian is studied and spoken as a [[second language]] by all [[Demographics of North Macedonia#ethnic groups|ethnic minorities]] in the country.\n\nOutside of the country, Macedonian is spoken as a native language by migrant communities throughout the [[Balkan Peninsula]], predominantly by Macedonians who live in the [[Macedonia (region)|geographical region of Macedonia]] and post-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] countries. The actual number of Macedonian native and second language speakers in the region of Macedonia is difficult to establish due to political policies of [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Albania]].  Several [[dialects of Macedonian|Macedonian dialects]] are also considered dialects of the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] or [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian language]], which further hinders establishing the number of native speakers of Macedonian. \n\nMacedonian is also spoken in [[continental Europe]], predominantly in countries of Western and Northern Europe. Other speakers can also be found in the rest of the world, predominantly [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. A 1964 estimate of the emigrant population put the number of Macedonian speakers outside the Balkans at approximately 580,000 people.<ref name=\"topolinska\">{{Harvnb|Topolinjska|1998}}</ref> \n\n==North Macedonia==\n[[File:Makedonija - Jezicki sastav po naseljima 2002-rus.png|thumb|left|250px|Distribution of Macedonian in North Macedonia (2002 census)]]\nIn North Macedonia, according to the 2002 census, among the country's total population of 2,022,547 people, 1,344,815 spoke Macedonian as a [[First language|native tongue]].

Estimates of the total number of speakers in the world include 3.5 million people. Macedonian is studied and spoken as a [[second language]] by all [[Demographics of North Macedonia#ethnic groups|ethnic minorities]] in the country.\n\nOutside of the country, Macedonian is spoken as a native language by migrant communities throughout the [[Balkan Peninsula]], predominantly by Macedonians who live in the [[Macedonia (region)|geographical region of Macedonia]] and post-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] countries. The actual number of Macedonian native and second language speakers in the region of Macedonia is difficult to establish due to political policies of [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Albania]].  Several [[dialects of Macedonian|Macedonian dialects]] are also considered dialects of the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] or [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian language]], which further hinders establishing the number of native speakers of Macedonian. \n\nMacedonian is also spoken in [[continental Europe]], predominantly in countries of Western and Northern Europe. Other speakers can also be found in the rest of the world, predominantly [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].

The series takes place in a [[Ninja World|fictional universe]] where countries vie for power by employing [[ninja]] who can use [[Jutsu (Naruto)|superhuman abilities]] in combat. The storyline is divided into two parts, simply named [[List of Naruto chapters (Part I)|Part I]] and [[List of Naruto chapters (Part II, volumes 28-48)|Part II]], with the latter taking place two-and-a-half years after the conclusion of Part I. It is followed by the sequel series ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]'' by Uky\u014d Kodachi, which continues where the epilogue of the first series left off. The series' storyline follows the adventures of a group of young ninja from the village of Konohagakure (Village Hidden in the Leaf).\n\nThe [[wikt:titular|eponymous]] character of the first series is [[Naruto Uzumaki]], an energetic ninja who wishes to become [[#Hokage|Hokage]], the leader of Konohagakure and holds a monster called the Nine Tails in his body. During the early part of the series, Naruto is assigned to [[List of Naruto characters#Team 7|Team 7]], in which he meets his rival [[Sasuke Uchiha]], a taciturn and highly skilled \"genius\" of the Uchiha clan; [[Sakura Haruno]], who is infatuated with Sasuke and has Naruto's attention and [[Kakashi Hatake]], the quiet and mysterious leader of the team. Over the course of the series, seeking out Sasuke when he ran away from the village, Naruto interacts with and befriends several fellow ninja in Konohagakure and other villages. He also encounters the series' antagonists, including [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]], a former ninja of Konohagakure scheming to destroy his former home, as well as the elite ninja of the criminal organization [[#Akatsuki|Akatsuki]] who seek out jinchuriki like Gaara for the tailed beasts.\n\nThe [[wikt:titular|eponymous]] character of the second series is [[Boruto Uzumaki]], the son of Naruto and [[Hinata Hyuga]] who is assigned to Team Konohamaru also known as Team 7, which includes Sasuke and Sakura's daughter \u2014 [[Sarada Uchiha]], Orochimaru's artificially created son \u2014 [[Mitsuki (Naruto)|Mitsuki]] and the group's leader \u2014 Konohamaru, the Third Hokage's grandson whom Naruto befriended as a child.\n\nAs he developed the series, Kishimoto created the three primary characters as a basis for the designs of the other three-person teams.<ref name=\"Art140\">Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, p. 140</ref> He also used characters in other [[sh\u014dnen manga|''sh\u014dnen'' manga]] as references in his design of the characters, a decision that was criticized by several anime and manga publications.<ref name=\"Art138\">Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, p. 138</ref><ref name=\"THEMAnimeReviews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=120|title=THEM Anime Reviews 4.0 \u2013 Naruto|publisher=T.H.E.M.

After reviewing different manga for ideas, he ultimately developed [[Sasuke Uchiha]]. When creating the primary heroine, Kishimoto admitted, \"I don't have a definite image of what a heroine should be\". He eventually created [[Sakura Haruno]], emphasizing \"her energy and flirtatious spirit\" as her primary characteristics. These three characters would be the mold for the other three main ''Naruto'' teams.<ref name=\"Art140\"/>\n\nThe separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a specific flavor. Kishimoto wished for each team member to be \"extreme\", having a high amount of aptitude in one given attribute, yet talentless in another. This approach was used to make each team perform best when individual members worked together to overcome their weaknesses. Having watched ''[[tokusatsu]]'' dramas as a child, Kishimoto wished for his teams to be different from the superhero teams in these dramas, dismissing the value of a team in which all the teammates were \"strong to the point of perfection\". Kishimoto notes that the different roles the characters assume is similar to many [[role-playing game]]s, and \"each character stands out better that way\".<ref name=\"Art141\">Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, p. 141</ref>\n\nKishimoto inserted villains into the story to counteract the lead characters' moral values. He stated that this focus on illustrating the difference in values is central to his creation of villains to the point that, \"I don't really think about them in combat\". The villains' physical appearances were also embellished to differentiate them from other characters, making it easier for a reader to follow the story and identify the villains, even in heated battle scenes. Kishimoto noted that making the villains \"flamboyant\" with a \"showy costume\" is \"one of my guiding principles\", as well as making them \"more memorable\".<ref name=\"Art142\">Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, p. 142</ref>\n\nWhen drawing the characters, Kishimoto consistently follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, [[inker|inking]], [[shading]], and coloring. These steps are followed when he is drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'', the cover of the ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'', or other media, but the toolkit he uses occasionally changes.<ref>Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, pp. 112\u2013114</ref> For instance, he used an [[airbrush]] for one illustration for a ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' cover, but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required.<ref name=\"Art118\">Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, p. 118</ref>\n\n==Main characters==\n===''Naruto''===\nThe protagonists of the ''Naruto'' series are Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and [[Kakashi Hatake]], who form {{nihongo4|\"Team 7\"|\u7b2c7\u73ed|Dainanahan}} of Konohagakure.

After he becomes a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to begin considering his teammates precious to the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing on revenge less than at the start of the series. Following an encounter and a subsequent defeat at the hands of his brother in Part I, however, Sasuke severs his ties and leaves the village to seek more power from a man named Orochimaru. By the events of the ''Boruto'' franchise, Sasuke has become a vigilante investigating the Otsutsuki clan while aiding Konohagakure.

He also inherits his maternal family's Gentle Fist technique despite apparently not inheriting the Byakugan unlike his sister, Himawari. Like his father when he used to pull pranks to have his existence be acknowledged, Boruto tends to commit mischief to get his father's attention after he became Hokage by defacing the Hokage Monument during the events of the series epilogue, but his father stops him and explains that he needs to care for their village. Boruto also admires his father's rival and friend Sasuke, seeking his training in order to surpass his father, later being accepted as his student {{gnr|ch|700}}.

Despite thinking of Naruto a bit poorly and often getting annoyed by him, he is one of the few people to have acknowledged him as a person rather than the tailed beast in childhood, remaining one of Naruto's close friends since then.{{gnr|ch|190}} In battle, Shikamaru can manipulate his shadow, and by extending it into another person's shadow he can force the target to mimic his movements.{{gnr|ch|107}} In the series epilogue, Shikamaru works as Naruto's advisor and is revealed to have married Temari who had moved to the Hidden Leaf, with whom he has a son, Shikadai.

After perfecting the Reanimation Jutsu, using it to bring back Madara Uchiha as his personal trump card, Kabuto forces [[#Obito Uchiha|Obito Uchiha]] into a tenuous alliance with him under the promise that he can have Sasuke once they win the war against the Ninja Alliance.{{gnr|ch|520}} However, during the second day of the Fourth Great Ninja War, Itachi manages to break free of Kabuto's control and force him to end the Reanimation Jutsu with Sasuke's help.

His English voice actor is [[Keith Silverstein]] with [[Kari Wahlgren]] voicing him as a child.\n\nThe Sound Four do not become a prominent part of the story until sent by their leader to escort Sasuke Uchiha to him. Even with Kimimaro joining the group to ensure Sasuke's passage to Orochimaru, the Sound Five all died in the process: Jirobo and Kidomaru killed in their respective fights against Ch\u014dji Akimichi and Neji Hy\u016bga, Sakon and Ukon taken out by Kankuro as they nearly kill Kiba Inuzuka, Tayuya indirectly killed by Temari as she had the upper hand on Shikamaru Nara, and Kimimaro succumbed to his unknown illness in the midst of his battle against Gaara and Rock Lee.{{gnr|ch|184, 217}} During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kimimaro is reanimated by Kabuto Yakushi as a pawn to battle against the Allied Shinobi Forces.{{gnr|ch|515}} In the anime adaptation, unaware that Kabuto brought them back instead of Orochimaru, the Sound Four were also reanimated and were allowed to act on their impulse for revenge against the members of the Sasuke Retrieval group before being defeated. It was also at the time of the war's climax that Kabuto reveals that he assimilated the Sound Five's DNA to access their abilities.{{gnr|ch|585}}\n\n===Akatsuki===\n{{nihongo4|Akatsuki|\u6681||lit. \"Dawn\" or \"Daybreak\"}} is an organization of criminal ninja that serves as the primary antagonistic force of the second part of the ''Naruto'' series. It was founded by Yahiko, [[Pain (Naruto)#Pain|Nagato]] and Konan. After Yahiko's death, it was led by Nagato with [[#Obito Uchiha|Obito]] as his benefactor. The Akatsuki's goal is world domination by using the power of the nine Tailed Beasts, Nagato assuming it was by forcing others to know suffering for true peace to come.{{gnr|ch|239}} But the actual goal is Obito enacting Madara's {{nihongo4|Project Tsuki no Me|\u6708\u306e\u773c\u8a08\u753b|Tsuki no Me Keikaku|literally \"Eye of the Moon Plan\"}}, which involves feeding the Tailed Beasts to the Gedo Statue for it to revert back into the Ten-Tails with Obito becoming its Jinchuriki to subjugate all life by projecting the Infinite Tsukiyomi on the moon's surface. The members of Akatsuki are ninja who have abandoned their villages, and are considered by their former homes to be S-class criminals, the most powerful and wanted ninja in the ''Naruto'' universe. At any given time, Akatsuki is composed of ten members, who operate in two-man teams; it was later reduced to nine after [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]]'s departure. Aside from an attempt by members Itachi Uchiha and [[#Kisame Hoshigaki|Kisame Hoshigaki]] to capture [[#Kurama|Kurama]] (the Nine-Tailed fox sealed within Naruto Uzumaki), Akatsuki is not prominently featured in Part I.{{gnr|ch|143}} In Part II, they take a more active role, capturing [[Gaara]] and extracting the one-tailed tanuki, Shukaku, from his body, as well as working towards capturing the remaining Tailed Beasts.{{gnr|ch|261}} Kishimoto called the Akatsuki's members [[antihero]]es as he wished to expand their backgrounds as much as the ones from the series' protagonists, contrasting them with other types of villains.<ref name=\"kishiintealpha\">{{cite journal|journal=Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha|title=Interview with Masashi Kishimoto (Creator of Naruto)|publisher=Viz Media|issue=2\u201306\u201312|date=February 2012|author=Kido, Misaki C.|pages=120\u2013123}}</ref>\n\n====Obito Uchiha====\n{{main|Obito Uchiha}}\n{{nihongo4|Obito Uchiha|\u3046\u3061\u306f \u30aa\u30d3\u30c8|Uchiha Obito}}, also known under his alias {{nihongo4|Tobi|\u30c8\u30d3}} is the true leader of Akatsuki and the primary antagonist for most of Part II. As a child during the Third Great Ninja War, being Kakashi's teammate in Team Minato, Obito was similar to Naruto in both wanting to become Hokage and unrequited love for his teammate Rin. When he and Kakashi rescue Rin when she was kidnapped by Hidden Stone Ninja during a mission, Obito's right side got crushed in a landslide. Obito believed his death was certain and had Rin transplant his left Sharingan into Kakashi to replace the latter's original left eye. But Obito finds himself saved at the second by Madara and outfitted with Zetsu prosthetics while conditioning him to become his apprentice, the ninja arranging Obito to witness Rin's death as a casualty of war by a reluctant Kakashi to break his spirit. Coming to the conclusion that he can use the Tailed Beasts to destroy the current reality and create a utopia, Obito takes up Madara's name following the latter's death while masking his voice. Obito would then arrange similar events for Nagato with Yahiko's death to create the current incarnation of the Akatsuki.{{gnr|ch|602|, |606}} Obito serves a behind-the-scenes role throughout the first half of Part II while revealed to have caused tragic prior to the series, including Kurama's attack on the Hidden Leaf as revenge on his sensei Minato for not supporting Kakashi to protect Rin{{gnr|ch|501}} Other than being able to use his right Sharingan to manipulate Kamui in a fashion that made it seem he is intangible and [[Teleportation|teleport]] over great distances, Obito can use Wood Style attacks as his prosthetics possess Hashirama's cells.{{gnr|ch|310|, |395}}\n\n====Zetsu====\n{{nihongo4|Zetsu|\u30bc\u30c4}} is the only member of the Akatsuki to regularly act without a partner, also being the only nonhuman member and Obito's right hand. Originally, Kaguya created a shadow-like symbiotic entity known as {{nihongo4|Black Zetsu|\u9ed2\u30bc\u30c4|Kuro Zetsu}} to manipulate her grandson Indra and his descendants throughout history so one among them can manifest a Rinnegan and free his creator. Black Zetsu succeeds with Madara, whom he deceived into believing that he created the entity's host body {{nihongo4|White Zetsu|\u767d\u30bc\u30c4|Shiro Zetsu}}. White Zetsu was originally part of an army that Kaguya was assembling for the purpose of fending off her kinsmen, the result of humans who mutated into drones as a result of being assimilated by the Ten Tails during Kaguya's Infinite Tsukuyomi ages ago. Though he and White Zetsu are effective in their symbiosis, Black Zetsu occasionally argued with his easygoing host. As White Zetsu is an extension of the Shinju, he can merge into the ground or vegetation to quickly travel to a new location or separate himself from the part of his body holding Black Zetsu and uses spores to create clones of himself or whoever he touches.{{gnr|ch|289}} This makes Zetsu not only of use to the Akatsuki as a spy, but also to devour bodies of deceased Akatsuki members or those that the organization does not want found.{{gnr|ch|255, 261}} Another of the White Zetsu that Black Zetsu brought out of the Gedo Statue, initially referred to as {{nihongo4|Guruguru|\u30b0\u30eb\u30b0\u30eb}} due to the spiral-shaped pattern on his body, is later named {{nihongo4|Tobi|\u30c8\u30d3}} and served as an exosuit for Obito while the youth was getting used to his new body. After White Zetsu is killed by Sasuke during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Black Zetsu went into hiding until it later merges itself onto Obito to force the human into resurrecting Madara.{{gnr|ch|575|, |656}} But ultimately, once the Eye of the Moon Plan ran its course, Black Zetsu reveals his true identity and fuses himself onto Madara to convert the human into a new body for Kaguya to inhabit.{{gnr|ch|674}} Black Zetsu then reveals his role in the conflict between the Senju and Uchiha while helping Kaguya deal with Naruto and Sasuke, eventually ripped away from his creator when Naruto severed Kaguya's arm. Seeing Kaguya being sealed away again, Black Zetsu is thrown by Naruto into the forming moon so he would not make another attempt to free his creator.{{gnr|ch|681, 688, 690}} Tobi, having participated in the war by encasing Yamato to access his Wood-Style before ejecting him once Madara succeeds in casting the Infinite Tsukiyomi, is last seen crumbling after the jutsu is canceled with his former captive the only witness to his death.{{gnr|ch|699}}\n\nAs Kishimoto originally planned Akatsuki to be a group of individuals with close to no human characteristics, he decided to make Zetsu half black and half white to emphasize his [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality]].<ref name=\"data3889\"/> In the Japanese anime, Zetsu is voiced by [[Nobuo Tobita]], who also voices the Tobi and the White Zetsu Army.<ref name=\"cd\"/> In episode 134 of the English adaptation, Black Zetsu is voiced by [[Michael Sorich]] and White Zetsu by [[Brian Beacock]], though both in the English ''Shippuden'' anime are voiced by [[Travis Willingham]] alongside Tobi and the White Zetsu Army.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2011-02-24/anime-usa-announces-laura-bailey-and-travis-willingham|title=Anime USA Announces Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham|date=April 24, 2011|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=May 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228040542/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2011-02-24/anime-usa-announces-laura-bailey-and-travis-willingham|archive-date=February 28, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Kisame Hoshigaki====\n{{nihongo4|Kisame Hoshigaki|\u5e72\u67ff \u9b3c\u9bab|Hoshigaki Kisame}} is a former ninja of [[Kirigakure]] and partnered to Itachi Uchiha, having a unique appearance with pale blue skin, a gill-like facial structure, and sharp triangular teeth.

While Konan's abilities are restricted when the paper is wet, since paper will cling to itself and lose its stiffness, she is able to use this weakness to her advantage as she implements explosive tags into her paper clones. After Nagato's death, Konan withdraws her position in Akatsuki and proclaims loyalty to Naruto.{{gnr|ch|372}} Later, she is confronted by Obito over the location of Nagato's Rinnegan eyes.

However, his extreme temperament led Kakuzu to dislike having a partner and eventually killing whomever he is partnered with in a fit of rage, being paired up with the immortal Hidan as a result.{{gnr|ch|322}} When Kakuzu was still living in his village, he was given a very important mission: assassinate [[Hashirama Senju]], the [[Ninja World#Kage|First Hokage]]. As the strongest shinobi of his time, Hashirama was far too strong for Kakuzu, and as such, the mission failed, with Kakuzu barely escaping with his life. Kakuzu returned to his village, and despite the overwhelming danger and risk he faced, he was dishonoured and severely punished unjustly. Gaining a violent for hatred for his village because of this unfair treatment, despite his loyalty and for his risking his life, Kakuzu escaped from prison and, in an act of vengeance and retaliation, brutally betrayed his village, stole the forbidden techniques of his village and murdered the village elders (as well as carving out their hearts), becoming a [[Ninja World#Rogue Ninja|rogue ninja]] in the process. Kakuzu's body is composed of a large number of black threads, allowing him to reattach any body part, being his or another, back onto its owner. The threads are also capable of piercing flesh, which Kakuzu uses to remove the still-beating hearts of his opponents for his personal use and integrates their hearts into his body to extend his life indefinitely.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=Naruto Character Official Data Book Hiden Sha no Sho|year=2008|publisher=Shueisha|isbn=978-4-08-874247-2|page=263}}</ref> Kakuzu can store up to four spare hearts in animal masks that are sewn to his back, which can be detached during combat situations to shoot elemental blasts at his opponents, and quickly recalled to his body if he needs a replacement heart.{{gnr|ch|336}} Kakuzu's hearts are systematically destroyed soon after his introduction by a group of Konohagakure ninja.

However, motivated by his desire to make works that last forever, Sasori secretly devised a way to convert the corpses of humans into puppets, allowing him to use any of the [[Jutsu (Naruto)|ninja abilities]] they possessed during their lives for himself. Leaving Sunagakure in his teenage, Sasori later kidnapped the Third Kazekage, transforming him into a human puppet and using him as his main weapon.{{gnr|ch|267}} Sasori's desire was to become art, so he converted his own body into a puppet, which essentially gives him eternal life and allows him to control hundreds of puppets at once.{{gnr|ch|271}} After joining the Akatsuki, Sasori was paired with [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]], and after his desertion, he was teamed with Deidara, who looks up to him and his artistic knowledge with reverence.{{gnr|ch|248}} {{gnr|ch|263}} In the Akatsuki, Sasori spent most of the time hidden inside Hiruko, a human puppet who served as both weapon and armour, which he adorned with Akatsuki's robe.

He is very arrogant about his immense battle prowess. Though he was a childhood friend of Hashirama amidst the conflicts of their respective clan, their friendship ends as a result of the war. As the leader of the Uchiha clan, Madara's overuse of [[Jutsu (Naruto)#Mangekyo Sharingan|Mangekyo Sharingan]] blinds him, forcing him to take the eyes of his late younger brother Izuna. This allows Madara to use his newly awakened Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan to continue the ongoing war between the Uchiha and the Senju.{{gnr|ch|386}} In later years, Hashirama comes forth with a peace offering between the two clans. Though he agrees to have peace with his former rival, Madara feels he would never be accepted by the Senju and loses hope in Hashirama.

In the Japanese anime, Madara (and Obito in his Madara guise) is voiced by [[Naoya Uchida]] while Gou Inoue voices him as a child.

This and the other horrifying acts that Kaguya resulted in the then-powerless people to denounce her as a {{nihongo4|\"Demon\"|\u9b3c|Oni}}.

But Kaguya created Black Zetsu at the last second to orchestrate her return by influencing Hagoromo's eldest son Indra and the Uchiha Clan. Having successfully manipulated Madara Uchiha into eventually casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi while having the Ten-Tails corpse absorbed by the Uchiha, Black Zetsu betrays Madara and converts him into a vessel for Kaguya to inhabit. From there, deeming Naruto and Sasuke a threat because they are the current reincarnations of her grandsons and because of their resemblance to her own children, Kaguya takes Team 7 and Obito into her dimensional realms to kill them there. However, after being overpowered by Naruto and Sasuke and with the help of Sakura's punch, Kaguya is resealed with the tailed beasts and Madara extracted from her body.{{gnr|ch|646|, |647}} Kaguya is voiced by [[Mami Koyama]] in Japanese and by [[Cissy Jones]] in the English dub.<ref>[[Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]</ref>\n\n====Toneri \u014ctsutsuki====\n{{nihongo4|Toneri \u014ctsutsuki|\u5927\u7b52\u6728 \u30c8\u30cd\u30ea|\u014ctsutsuki Toneri}} is the antagonist of ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]'', a descendant of Hamura \u014ctsutsuki whose family left the world and live on the moon to maintain the imprisonment of the Gedo Statue.

His artistic talents extend to his choice of attacks in battles, being that he can infuse chakra with his inking brush to make his drawings come to life.{{gnr|ch|283}} In the series epilogue, Sai ends up marrying Ino Yamanaka and together they have a son, Inojin.{{gnr|ch|700}} Sai's voice actor is [[Satoshi Hino]] in the ''[[List of Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episodes|Naruto: Shipp\u016bden]]'' anime, and his English voice actor is [[Benjamin Diskin]] except in ''Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals'', where he is voiced by [[Lucien Dodge]].<ref name=\"cd\"/><ref name=\"diskin\">{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-05-19/voice-actors-announced-at-mcm-expo|title=(Updated) Voice-Actors Announced At MCM Expo|work=Anime News Network|date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=May 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922012056/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-05-19/voice-actors-announced-at-mcm-expo|archive-date=September 22, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Yamato===\n{{nihongo4|Yamato|\u30e4\u30de\u30c8}} is introduced during Part II of the series as a ANBU member who becomes a substitute leader in [[#Protagonists|Team Kakashi]].{{gnr|ch|285}} \"Yamato\" is not his real name, but rather a codename assigned to him for the purposes of joining Team Kakashi.{{gnr|ch|317}} Unlike Kakashi, who was his senior in the ANBU and referred to him as {{nihongo4|Tenzo|\u30c6\u30f3\u30be\u30a6|Tenz\u014d}}, Yamato believes ninja should be able to look after themselves to the point of leaving behind any he sees as a hindrance.{{gnr|ch|298}} During his childhood, Yamato was abducted by Orochimaru and experimented upon in an attempt to replicate [[#Hokage|Hashirama]]'s Wood Style. In the anime, the ordeal erased Yamato's memories as he was taken in by Danzo to serve as a Root operative under the code name {{nihongo4|Kinoe|\u7532|}}. But after meeting Kakashi, Kinoe eventually left Root and joined the Anbu as Tenzo.\n\nAfter Kakashi Hatake was wounded during his team's mission to rescue Gaara from the Akatsuki, Tsunade places Yamato in Team Kakashi under the cover of acting leader so he can use his Wood Style whenever the need to suppress Kurama's influence over Naruto raises.{{gnr|ch|291}} However, because he possessed Hashirama's DNA, Yamato gets captured by Kabuto to strengthen the White Zetsu army for the Fourth Great Ninja War. Yamato is eventually revealed to have been contained the body of the White Zetsu known as Guruguru until the altered human ejected him once Madara is able to cast the Infinite Tsukiyomi.{{gnr|ch|676}} In ''Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring'', Yamato is among the ninja assigned to keep tabs on Orochimaru.

Having unintentionality inherited fragments of the Shinju's chakra while in their mother's womb, Hagoromo and Hamura ended up fighting Kaguya upon learning the truth of the utopia they were born into. After the brothers defeated Kaguya following her transformation into the Ten-Tails, Hagoromo extracted her chakra and sealed the Gedo Statue in what became the moon where Hamura and his descendants reside. Using the chakra to establish a practice known as ninshu, which eventually evolved into ninjutsu to his dismay, Hagoromo started a family while considering an heir to his legacy between his sons, Asura and Indra. While Indra was naturally gifted and self-reliant, Hagoromo ultimately decided on Asura due to his ability to befriend others and peaceful ideologies. This would cause a rift between the brothers, Hagoromo unaware of Black Zetsu's role in turning Indra against his family. Hagoromo later uses the last of his strength to create the Tailed Beasts before passing away. Despite his death, Hagoromo's spirit observed Asura and Indra throughout their reincarnations, including Hashirama and Madara, before his sons' current incarnations as Naruto and Sasuke. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, realizing Madara's intentions, Hagoromo intervenes to give Naruto and Sasuke the power to defeat Kaguya and later bringing Team 7 back from Kaguya's dimension with the deceased Kage.

She also inherits her maternal family's Byakugan, which allows her to do the Gentle Fist technique capable of blocking the target's chakra points with one hit, although she only activates them when she is upset. Like her mother, Himawari is kind-hearted and is fond of her brother Boruto, though she has a temper like her late-paternal grandmother that terrifies Boruto if she is pushed too hard. One such moment resulted in Himawari accidentally knocking Naruto out before his [[inauguration]] as Hokage with Kurama developing a phobia of her from the near-death ordeal. She visits Neji's grave with her mother during the epilogue. {{gnr|ch|700}} In the Japanese version, Himawari is voiced by Y\u016bki Kuwahara in ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]'' and [[Saori Hayami]] in ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]''.<ref name=\"boruto2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-21/boruto-naruto-the-movie-casts-kensho-ono-daisuke-namikawa-more/.89548|title=Boruto -Naruto the Movie- Casts Kensho Ono, Daisuke Namikawa, More|date=June 21, 2015|work=Anime News Network|accessdate=June 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622214502/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-21/boruto-naruto-the-movie-casts-kensho-ono-daisuke-namikawa-more/.89548|archive-date=June 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In the English version, Himawari is voiced by [[Stephanie Sheh]] in ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]'' and [[Melissa Fahn]] in ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]''.\n\n===Sumire Kakei===\n:{{anime voices|[[Aya End\u014d]]|[[Erica Lindbeck]]}}\n{{nihongo4|Sumire Kakei|\u7b67 \u30b9\u30df\u30ec|Kakehi Sumire}} is a class representative during Boruto's time in the Hidden Leaf's Academy, and is close friends with Sarada and Chocho.

When Gaara is captured by the Akatsuki, Chiyo joins Team Kakashi to rescue the Kazekage. Confronting Sasori, Chiyo is able to kill her grandson with help from Sakura Haruno. Despite their efforts, Gaara also dies before they can rescue him.{{gnr|ch|275|, |278}} Touched by the genuine bond formed between Sunagakure and Konoha, Chiyo gives up her life to revive Gaara, hoping that the relationship of peace might be continued.{{gnr|ch|280}} However, by the Fourth Great Ninja War, Chiyo is brought back by Kabuto's Reanimation Jutsu to fight against the combined Ninja army.

He is the son of the Third Raikage, groomed especially to succeed him, and believes that ninja must always show resolve even when they are defeated. He is also considered by many to be the fastest ninja in the world following Minato's death, up until when Naruto is able to dodge his attacks. A would later fight in the Third Shinobi World War, where he would frequently fight with Minato Namikaze, only for all of their battles to create stalemates.{{gnr|ch|542}} After Killer Bee is seemingly abducted by Taka, A resolves to kill Sasuke and ridicules Naruto for trying to defend him. He and Sasuke later fight at the Five Kage Summit, during which A loses his left arm;{{gnr|ch|464}} after learning the truth about Killer Bee, he helps him defeat Kisame.{{gnr|ch|473}} A eventually becomes the Supreme Commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces, and after allowing Naruto and Killer Bee to fight in the war once they defeat him, fights and loses against Madara.

She even proceeds to brutally punch Naruto in the face repeatedly after he allows her to do so as compensation for not giving up information on Sasuke. Karui is assigned as part of the Second Division during the Fourth Ninja War. Sometime after the war ends, she moves to Konohagakure and marries Choji Akimichi, giving birth to their daughter Chocho, who is an academy student in the series epilogue.{{gnr|ch|700}} Kauri is voiced by [[Yuka Komatsu]] in the Japanese anime.

She is apparently relatively new to the position and does not remember the previous leadership, which conducted witch hunts against kekkei genkai users like her, fondly. During the Kage Summit, Mei acts rather dodgy when asked about rumors that [[List of Naruto characters#Akatsuki|Akatsuki]] formed in her village, and when she finds out Danzo is capable of mind control she suspects him of using it on the previous Mizukage. She manages to nearly kill Sasuke during the meeting and initially helps guard the daimy\u014d of the Shinobi Countries during the preparation for the Fourth Ninja War. During the war, Mei fights the revived Madara Uchiha with the other Kages, though despite their impressive teamwork, they still end up losing to Madara's might.

Chojuro frequently annoys Ao because he stutters and seems to lack self-confidence. After accompanying the Mizukage to the Kage Summit, he helps her guard the daimy\u014d of the Shinobi Countries, and is able to gain enough self-confidence to help Naruto defeat Black Zetsu.

He engaged Team Konohamaru and Katasuke, using of the latter's inventions to kill his aide while wounded Konohamaru. A revenge-driven Boruto manages to outwit and overpower Ao, sparing the man's life as Ao ends up sacrificing himself to save Boruto from being crushed by Kashin Koji's Boiler Toad.

During the Kage Summit, he admitted to have frequently hired Akatsuki.{{gnr|ch|458}}{{gnr|ch|459}} While Onoki justify hiring the Akatsuki as necessary in protecting his village during its demilitarization, both it and his advanced age kept him from being named leader of the Shinobi Alliance though Sasuke's intrusion and Gaara's conduct cause Onoki to regain some of more noble traits from his youth. Later, he goes out to find Kabuto and prevent him from finding Killer Bee and Naruto and succeeds in protecting them. Throughout the war, Onoki's techniques proved instrumental in keeping Alliance members alive and he becomes the de facto leader in the assault against the real Madara Uchiha. Years later, Onoki retires due to his failing health and passes down his title to his granddaughter, Kurotsuchi. In the ''Boruto'' series, following an attack on his village by a rogue ninja a decade after the Fourth Great Ninja War that took the life of his grandson Kozuchi, Onoki began to develop the Akuta as a defense force to keep people safe and unharmed. He continued perfecting the process after receiving a White Zetsu's remains, improving on the Akuta while creating Fabrications like his partial clone son K\u016b as he orchestrated Mitsuki's abduction to refine the process. But upon seeing the extent the Fabrications would go to see his ideals realized, Onoki helps Boruto stop the artificial humans at the cost of his life.

She was also an acquaintance of Deidara before his defection to Akatsuki. Kurotsuchi participates in the Fourth Ninja War, serving in the Second Division under her father, Kitsuchi. She survives the war and becomes the {{nihongo4|Fourth Tsuchikage|\u56db\u4ee3\u76ee\u571f\u5f71|Yondaime Tsuchikage}} by the series epilogue, replacing her ailing grandfather.

Through Obito's scheme, Kurama is released and attacks Konohagakure before being stopped by the [[#Minato Namikaze|Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze]], who seals the fox's Yin half within himself. Following this, Minato and Kushina sacrifice themselves to seal the weakened Yang Kurama within their son, Naruto Uzumaki, twelve years before the series' start.{{gnr|ch|1}}{{gnr|ch|500}} Throughout the series, Naruto tries to harness Kurama's immense chakra to perform several jutsu that would normally be impossible for a shinobi of his age.{{gnr|ch|95}} But Naruto soon learns that relying too much on Kurama's power would allow the fox to impose its will over its host to the point of breaking the seal. Naruto eventually takes control of the fox's chakra with help from an imprint of Kushina.{{gnr|ch|499}} During Naruto's fight against Obito, seeing its host's resolve to save the other Tailed Beasts, Kurama befriends Naruto by allowing him to achieve Tailed Beast Mode.{{gnr|ch|571}} Eventually, as Kurama is extracted from Naruto, the Tailed Beast tells Gaara how to save Naruto's life by transferring Yin Kurama from Minato into Naruto. Kurama is later returned to its Jinchuriki's body and becomes whole again as it reunites with its Yin counterpart. Kishimoto was mainly inspired to create Kurama based on the [[Yoko Kurama|character with the same name]] from the manga series ''[[YuYu Hakusho]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|authorlink=Masashi Kishimoto|title=NARUTO\u2015\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8\u2015[\u79d8\u4f1d\u00b7\u7686\u306e\u66f8]\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30d7\u30ec\u30df\u30a2\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3BOOK|series=Naruto|date=December 4, 2009|publisher=Shueisha|location=Japan|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-08-874834-4|pages=74\u201381}}</ref> The inclusion of the fox spirit was also inspired by [[Godzilla]].<ref name=\"nippon.com\">{{cite web|title=Farewell, Naruto: The Curtain Closes on the World\u2019s Best-Loved Ninja|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/views/b00114/|publisher=Nippon Communications Foundation|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en|date=26 December 2014|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150113014354/http://www.nippon.com/en/views/b00114/|archive-date=13 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the Japanese anime, Kurama's voice actor is [[Tessh\u014d Genda]], and in the English adaptation, he is voiced by [[Paul St. Peter]].<ref name=\"fifty-six\">{{cite episode|title=\u751f\u304b\u6b7b\u304b!?\u514d\u8a31\u7686\u4f1d\u306f\u547d\u61f8\u3051!|series=Naruto|credits=Studio Pierrot|network=TV Tokyo|airdate=October 29, 2003}}</ref><ref name=\"efifty-six\">{{cite episode|title=Live or Die!

The group gets split up after their attempt at terrorizing the Five Kage Summit, but they later reunite as part of the Allied Shinobi Forces. Following the war, they went back to Otogakure along with Orochimaru.\n\n====Suigetsu Hozuki====\n{{nihongo4|Suigetsu Hozuki|\u9b3c\u706f\u6c34\u6708|Hozuki Suigetsu}} is the first member to join. Originally from Kirigakure, his goal is to claim all of the swords wielded by the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, and from there reform the organization in memory of his late brother Mangetsu, who was a member himself{{gnr|ch|523}}. Although his dream was initially cut short by Orochimaru, after Sasuke freed him he managed to claim Zabuza's sword, but lost it while battling the Kage. Suigetsu tends to have a sadistic personality, constantly fascinating about cutting things and consequently getting on Karin's nerves, yet sees himself as normal in comparison to most other people. His clan has the ability to turn any part of their body into water, but must stay hydrated to do so{{gnr|ch|347}}. Suigetsu is voiced by [[Takashi Kondou|Takashi Kondo]] in Japanese and by [[Grant George]] in the English dub except in ''Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals'', where he is voiced by [[Todd Haberkorn]].\n\n====Karin====\n{{nihongo4|Karin|\u9999\u71d0}} is the second member of Taka and a member of the Uzumaki Clan that Naruto belongs to. She was originally from Kusagakure and later another unnamed village, but after the latter was destroyed she was taken in by Orochimaru, eventually becoming a loyal servant to him. After briefly encountering Sasuke during the Chunin Exams, she became addicted to him and decided to join Taka to be at his side.{{gnr|ch|482}} Karin was critically wounded by Sasuke during his battle against Danzo, and after he left her behind, Karin was arrested by Kakashi, in turn meeting Naruto for the first time{{gnr|ch|486}}. She later met up with Sasuke to confront him, but instead immediately forgave him. Sometime after, she moved on from Sasuke due to wanting him to be happy and helped deliver Sasuke and Sakura's daughter, Sarada. Karin is a Sensor Type, able to sense other's chakra and feel a person's aura that way, such as seeing Naruto's chakra as \"bright and warm\". She also can heal people if they bite her, which causes them to absorb chakra, leaving permanent marks all over her body, but due to the risks involved she can only use it once per day. In Japanese, Karin is voiced by [[Kanako T\u014dj\u014d]] up until Episode 485, when Toa Yukinari takes over. In English, she is voiced by [[Ali Hillis]] except in ''Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals'', where she is voiced by [[Michelle Ruff]].\n\n====Jugo====\n{{nihongo4|Jugo|\u91cd\u543e|J\u016bgo}} is the third member of Taka. His clan has the ability to use senjutsu, but due to the severe amount of natural energy they absorb they are prone to fits of extreme violence, with additional side effects being that they can revert to a childlike form if they use it the wrong way. Because of this, in childhood, Jugo was an outcast, eventually finding solace in Kimimaro whom he saw as an older sibling.{{gnr|ch|414}} After meeting Sasuke, he tried to refuse being part of Taka and used his abilities, but Sasuke managed to calm him down. As Kimimaro was the only other person who could do this, Jugo decided to follow Sasuke in the belief that he was Kimimaro's reincarnation.{{gnr|ch|414}} Jugo is voiced by [[Shuhei Sakaguchi]] in Japanese and by [[Travis Willingham]] in the English dub except in ''Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals'', where he is voiced by [[Patrick Seitz]] and is also voiced by Kyle Hebert in ''Boruto: Naruto Next Generations''.\n\n===Danzo Shimura===\n{{redirect|Danzo|16th century ninja|Kat\u014d Danz\u014d}}\n{{nihongo4|Danzo Shimura|\u5fd7\u6751 \u30c0\u30f3\u30be\u30a6|Shimura Danz\u014d}} is one of the oldest villagers in Konohagakure, and a moderately cantankerous [[war hawk]] who was Hiruzen's rival whom he consequently opposed along with the other Hokage for placing world peace above their village's best interests.{{gnr|ch|285}} As Hiruzen obtained the Third Hokage title, Danzo uses the Foundation and his own personal Root [[black ops]] to secretly oversee their village's security along with his personal goal to become a Hokage.{{gnr|ch|298}} This led to Danzo being responsible for events that included Kabuto's defection and orchestrating the Uchiha Massacre. The latter event result in him having the transplanted right eye of Shisui Uchiha, whom he killed, along with having Orochimaru using Shin's genetic makeup to graft Danzo's right arm with a large number of Sharingan eyes and Hashirama's cells. Following Pain's attack devastating Konohagakure, Danzo took advantage of Tsunade's coma in convincing the Fire Country's [[Daimy\u014d|feudal lord]] to make him Acting {{nihongo4|Candidate Sixth Hokage|\u516d\u4ee3\u76ee\u706b\u5f71\u5019\u88dc|Rokudaime Hokage Kouho}} and uses his position to decree Sasuke a wanted criminal before attaining the Five Kage summit to convince the formation of the Shinobi alliance with himself as its leader. But the plan fails as Danzo ends up being fatally wounded after being forced to fight Sasuke, using the last of his strength in an attempted sealing jutsu on his killer and Obito.{{gnr|ch|481}} Though the jutsu failed, Danz\u014d destroyed Shisui's Sharingan to ensure Tobi would not obtain it. With Danzo's death, the Foundation was disbanded in the aftermath of the Fourth Great Ninja War with its members allowed to live in peace while integrating back into society. In the Japanese anime he is voiced by [[Hiroshi Ito (voice actor)|Hiroshi Ito]] and in the English version he is voiced by [[William Frederick Knight]] except in ''Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals'', where he is voiced by [[Richard Epcar]].<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/naruto/chara/index.html|title=Character|publisher=[[TV Tokyo]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=October 23, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623082548/http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/naruto/chara/index.html|archivedate=June 23, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"forty\">{{cite episode|title=\u7d50\u6210!\u65b0\u30ab\u30ab\u30b7\u73ed|series=Naruto: Shipp\u016bden|credits=Studio Pierrot|network=TV Tokyo|airdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Rin Nohara===\n{{nihongo4|Rin Nohara|\u306e\u306f\u3089 \u30ea\u30f3|Nohara Rin}} is a member of Team Minato and the teammate of [[#Kakashi Hatake|Kakashi Hatake]] and [[#Obito Uchiha|Obito Uchiha]], appearing only in person during the Kakashi Gaiden act.{{gnr|ch|239}} Rin acts as a medical ninja and she has a crush on Kakashi, though she is unaware that she herself has the affection of Obito. When Team Minato is sent to sabotage Kannabi Bridge during the Third Great Ninja War, Rin is kidnapped by the Iwagakure ninja before the resulting rescue mission ends with Obito's apparent death.{{gnr|ch|241, 243}} Sometime afterward, Rin is captured by the Kirigakure ninja and made into Isobu's Jinchuriki as part of a [[Trojan horse]] scheme to destroy Konoha. Rin realized the scheme while being rescued and jumped in the way of Kakashi's Lightning Blade to save the village at the cost of her life, which is later revealed to have been orchestrated by Madara to break Obito's spirit.{{gnr|ch|604, 630}} Obito later learns upon his death that Rin's spirit has always been waiting for him, and later guides him to the other side after he metaphysically helps Kakashi one last time in his team's battle against Kaguya. In the Japanese anime, Rin's voice actress is [[Haruhi Nanao]], and her English voice actress is [[Stephanie Sheh]].\n\n===Kushina Uzumaki===\n{{nihongo4|Kushina Uzumaki|\u3046\u305a\u307e\u304d \u30af\u30b7\u30ca|Uzumaki Kushina}} is the mother of the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki and the wife of the Fourth Hokage, [[#Minato Namikaze|Minato Namikaze]].{{gnr|ch|382}} She is a host of [[#Kurama|Kurama]], immediately preceding Naruto.{{gnr|ch|499}} While Naruto physically resembles his father, Minato, he inherits most of his personality from Kushina, who is brash, temperamental, likes ramen, and even has the {{nihongo4|\"Believe it!\"|\u3060\u3063\u3066\u3070\u306d|dattebane}} verbal tic, which both her son and grandson inherit. Being a member of the Uzumaki Clan, Kushina possesses a special chakra that was distinguished even among her peers, causing her to be sent from her homeland to Konohagakure to be the host of Kurama, replacing Mito Uzumaki.{{gnr|ch|500}} In Konohagakure, Kushina met with Minato who became Kushina's love after he saved her from a kidnapper, leading to their marriage.{{gnr|ch|498}} During her pregnancy, she had to be sent to a secretive place during labor to prevent Kurama's seal being broken.{{gnr|ch|500}} However, the place was subdued by Obito Uchiha, and he released Kurama who ran rampant on Konoha.{{gnr|ch|501}} She and Minato both sacrifice their lives to seal Kurama to Naruto after the tailed beast is weakened from losing his yin-chakra, while also placing some of their chakra to their son as a fail-safe if he would break the seal.{{gnr|ch|503}} In Part II, Kushina's chakra appears during Naruto's subconscious battle with Kurama, helping her son to seal the fox and to tell him the truth behind Kurama's attack sixteen years ago.{{gnr|ch|497}} Before disappearing, she thanks Naruto for forgiving her about the whole ordeal of the sealing of Kurama.{{gnr|ch|504}} In the Japanese anime, Kushina is voiced by [[Emi Shinohara]]. She was voiced by [[Cindy Robinson]] in the English version before [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] took over the role since episode 246 and onwards.\n\n===Shisui Uchiha===\n{{nihongo4|Shisui Uchiha|\u3046\u3061\u306f \u30b7\u30b9\u30a4|Uchiha Shisui}}, known as {{nihongo4|\"Shisui of the Body Flicker\"|\u77ac\u8eab\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30a4|Shunshin no Shisui}}, was one of the most talented of the Uchiha clan and Itachi's best friend. Shisui possessed unique Mangekyo Sharingan that allow him to use the [[Jutsu (Naruto)#Mangeky\u014d Sharingan|Kotoamatsukami]] ability, which allows him to manipulate others without their knowledge. Shisui intended to use Kotoamatsukami to stop the Uchiha's coup when [[Danzo Shimura|Danzo]] stole one of his eyes, giving his other eye to Itachi to protect the village to his stead as he commits suicide and later found on the river by Uchiha military policemen and assuming Shisui was murdered by Itachi. Danzo had the eye transplanted into him so he can manipulate others like Mifune to achieve his goals, later destroying it in his final moments to prevent Tobi from taking it. The eye given to Itachi, on the other hand, is placed in one of his crows and intended for it to be used by Naruto against Sasuke as a means to stop him from attacking the village. But a reanimated Itachi is forced to use it on himself to break free from Kabuto's control, quickly destroying the eye to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is [[Hidenobu Kiuchi]], while his voice actor in the English adaptation is Nicolas Roye.\n\n===Kawaki===\n{{nihongo4|Kawaki|\u30ab\u30ef\u30ad|Kawaki}} is a tattooed youth who became a member of Kara after being brought by Jigen from a drunkard father, bearing a tattoo of the Roman numeral IX under his left eye and bestowed a Kama mark by Jigen to be made into a living weapon for Kara. He was heavily modified with microscopic Shinobi-Ware implanted in his body that give him abilities similar to Jugo's Sage Transformation in altering his physiology at a cellular level. For reasons yet to be revealed, Kawaki left Kara and encountered Boruto who brings him to the Hidden Leaf as he lives with the Uzumaki family. The two would end up becoming enemies as hinted in prologue of the ''Boruto'' series, an older Kawaki appearing to have perpetrated Konoha's destruction as he confronts an older Boruto while declaring the age of shinobi has come to an end.\n\n==Reception==\nThe characters of ''Naruto'' have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Active Anime lauded the characters for not being \"simple cardboard cut-out characters\" due to their \"fleshed out personalities\" and \"underlying dramatic motivations\", and praised the \"deeply moving emotional trials\" they undergo over the course of the series.<ref name=\"ActiveAnimeReview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.activeanime.com/pn/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=3414|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728170141/http://www.activeanime.com/pn/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=3414|archivedate=July 28, 2008|title=ActiveAnime.com :: NARUTO UNCUT BOX SET 1 (ADVANCE REVIEW)|publisher=Active Anime|date=July 3, 2006|accessdate=March 27, 2008}}</ref> Adam Cook of Anime Boredom agreed with this assessment, extolling the characters as \"well rounded\" and \"imaginative\", and celebrated how the characters allowed the series to successfully incorporate comedy, action, and drama together in a believable manner.<ref name=\"AnimeBoredomReview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.homemademech.com/anime-reviews/naruto/191/|title=Naruto anime reviews|publisher=Anime Boredom|author=Cook, Adam|date=May 20, 2004|accessdate=March 30, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013204943/http://www.homemademech.com/anime-reviews/naruto/191/|archivedate=October 13, 2006}}</ref> Christina Ross of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews disagreed, dismissing the characters as echoes of stereotypical ''sh\u014dnen'' characters, and noted that several of the characters were not likable.<ref name=\"THEMAnimeReviews\"/> A second review from Derrick Tucker, also of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews offered a more positive view, commenting that Naruto Uzumaki combined the finer values of his ''sh\u014dnen'' predecessors, but lamented how the characters' personalities tended to fall between Naruto's \"charisma and coolness\" and Sasuke's \"blandness\", making it difficult to think about the characters on \"any deep or meaningful level\".<ref name=\"THEMAnimeReviews2\"/> Justin Rich of the entertainment website Mania asserted that the series lacked the \"tremendous depth in {{sic|it|'s|nolink=y|expected=its}} characters\" or \"the most flushed out backgrounds\" seen in other ''sh\u014dnen'' series, and believed the primary strength of the series was the fighting.<ref name=\"AnimeOnDVDReviewDVD4\"/> The anime and manga magazine ''[[Neo (magazine)|Neo]]'' described Naruto's character as \"irksome\", but attributed the series' \"almost sickening addictiveness\" to its level of characterization.<ref name=\"neo023\">{{Cite news|last=White|first=Nik|date=September 2006|title=Naruto Vol. 1: Unleashed|magazine=[[Neo (magazine)|Neo]]|place=United Kingdom|publisher=Uncooked Media|issue=23|pages=70\u201371|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nThe visual appearances of the characters in the anime and manga have also received notice from reviewers. Carl Kimlinger of [[Anime News Network]] praised the characters' \"distinctive clothing, hair, faces and personalities\" that made them easily identifiable, as well as Kishimoto's \"clear eye for geography, movement and the human form\" and \"impeccable visual timing\".<ref name=\"ANNManga8-10Review\"/> Tucker, on the other hand, described Kishimoto as \"an average artist at best\" and derided the poor transition of his artistic style into animation.<ref name=\"THEMAnimeReviews\"/> Despite this, he admitted that when the animators were at their best, they produced \"artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga\", but ultimately concluded the animation was \"a mixed bag\".<ref name=\"THEMAnimeReviews2\"/>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=978-1-4215-1407-9}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=NARUTO\u2015\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8\u2015\u3000\u5916\u4f1d \uff5e\u4e03\u4ee3\u76ee\u706b\u5f71\u3068\u7dcb\u8272\u306e\u82b1\u3064\u6708\uff5e|trans-title=[[Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring]]|date=August 8, 2015|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|ISBN=978-1-4215-1407-9}}\n;''Naruto'' manga volumes by [[Masashi Kishimoto|Kishimoto, Masashi]].

The series takes place in a [[Ninja World|fictional universe]] where countries vie for power by employing [[ninja]] who can use [[Jutsu (Naruto)|superhuman abilities]] in combat. The storyline is divided into two parts, simply named [[List of Naruto chapters (Part I)|Part I]] and [[List of Naruto chapters (Part II, volumes 28-48)|Part II]], with the latter taking place two-and-a-half years after the conclusion of Part I. It is followed by the sequel series ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]'' by Uky\u014d Kodachi, which continues where the epilogue of the first series left off. The series' storyline follows the adventures of a group of young ninja from the village of Konohagakure (Village Hidden in the Leaf).\n\nThe [[wikt:titular|eponymous]] character of the first series is [[Naruto Uzumaki]], an energetic ninja who wishes to become [[#Hokage|Hokage]], the leader of Konohagakure and holds a monster called the Nine Tails in his body. During the early part of the series, Naruto is assigned to [[List of Naruto characters#Team 7|Team 7]], in which he meets his rival [[Sasuke Uchiha]], a taciturn and highly skilled \"genius\" of the Uchiha clan; [[Sakura Haruno]], who is infatuated with Sasuke and has Naruto's attention and [[Kakashi Hatake]], the quiet and mysterious leader of the team. Over the course of the series, seeking out Sasuke when he ran away from the village, Naruto interacts with and befriends several fellow ninja in Konohagakure and other villages. He also encounters the series' antagonists, including [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]], a former ninja of Konohagakure scheming to destroy his former home, as well as the elite ninja of the criminal organization [[#Akatsuki|Akatsuki]] who seek out jinchuriki like Gaara for the tailed beasts.\n\nThe [[wikt:titular|eponymous]] character of the second series is [[Boruto Uzumaki]], the son of Naruto and [[Hinata Hyuga]] who is assigned to Team Konohamaru also known as Team 7, which includes Sasuke and Sakura's daughter \u2014 [[Sarada Uchiha]], Orochimaru's artificially created son \u2014 [[Mitsuki (Naruto)|Mitsuki]] and the group's leader \u2014 Konohamaru, the Third Hokage's grandson whom Naruto befriended as a child.\n\nAs he developed the series, Kishimoto created the three primary characters as a basis for the designs of the other three-person teams.<ref name=\"Art140\">Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, p. 140</ref> He also used characters in other [[sh\u014dnen manga|''sh\u014dnen'' manga]] as references in his design of the characters, a decision that was criticized by several anime and manga publications.<ref name=\"Art138\">Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, p. 138</ref><ref name=\"THEMAnimeReviews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=120|title=THEM Anime Reviews 4.0 \u2013 Naruto|publisher=T.H.E.M.

After reviewing different manga for ideas, he ultimately developed [[Sasuke Uchiha]]. When creating the primary heroine, Kishimoto admitted, \"I don't have a definite image of what a heroine should be\". He eventually created [[Sakura Haruno]], emphasizing \"her energy and flirtatious spirit\" as her primary characteristics. These three characters would be the mold for the other three main ''Naruto'' teams.<ref name=\"Art140\"/>\n\nThe separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a specific flavor. Kishimoto wished for each team member to be \"extreme\", having a high amount of aptitude in one given attribute, yet talentless in another. This approach was used to make each team perform best when individual members worked together to overcome their weaknesses. Having watched ''[[tokusatsu]]'' dramas as a child, Kishimoto wished for his teams to be different from the superhero teams in these dramas, dismissing the value of a team in which all the teammates were \"strong to the point of perfection\". Kishimoto notes that the different roles the characters assume is similar to many [[role-playing game]]s, and \"each character stands out better that way\".<ref name=\"Art141\">Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, p. 141</ref>\n\nKishimoto inserted villains into the story to counteract the lead characters' moral values. He stated that this focus on illustrating the difference in values is central to his creation of villains to the point that, \"I don't really think about them in combat\". The villains' physical appearances were also embellished to differentiate them from other characters, making it easier for a reader to follow the story and identify the villains, even in heated battle scenes. Kishimoto noted that making the villains \"flamboyant\" with a \"showy costume\" is \"one of my guiding principles\", as well as making them \"more memorable\".<ref name=\"Art142\">Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, p. 142</ref>\n\nWhen drawing the characters, Kishimoto consistently follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, [[inker|inking]], [[shading]], and coloring. These steps are followed when he is drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'', the cover of the ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'', or other media, but the toolkit he uses occasionally changes.<ref>Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, pp. 112\u2013114</ref> For instance, he used an [[airbrush]] for one illustration for a ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' cover, but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required.<ref name=\"Art118\">Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, p. 118</ref>\n\n==Main characters==\n===''Naruto''===\nThe protagonists of the ''Naruto'' series are Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and [[Kakashi Hatake]], who form {{nihongo4|\"Team 7\"|\u7b2c7\u73ed|Dainanahan}} of Konohagakure. After Sasuke Uchiha's defection and Naruto's departure from Konohagakure at the end of Part I, the team disbands. During Part II, the team reforms as {{nihongo4|\"Team Kakashi\"|\u30ab\u30ab\u30b7\u73ed|Kakashi-Han}} with two new members: [[#Sai|Sai]], who occupies Sasuke's position, and [[#Yamato|Yamato]], who becomes the acting Captain.{{gnr|ch|285}} During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Team 7 reunites to fight Madara Uchiha who later becomes Kaguya \u014ctsutsuki. Once the War is over, Sasuke and Naruto have their final battle. After the fight ends, Team 7 is finally reunited permanently.\n\n====Naruto Uzumaki====\n{{main|Naruto Uzumaki}}\nNaruto Uzumaki is the annoying, pervy brat in the Naruto series, and he is the main character. As he grows older, he doesn't need to be funny anymore, as his classmates accept him for who he is. He is also the jinchuuriki of the nine tails/Kurama. As he matures, he starts to make a friendship with Kurama. near the end of part 2, he and Kurama work as one. His teammates are Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno and Kakashi Hatake. As the series goes on, he gains new friends and enemies. He becomes 7th (Nandaime) Hokage after the Shippuden Series ends. Naruto is voiced by Maile Flanagan in the English Anime.\n\n====Sasuke Uchiha====\n{{main|Sasuke Uchiha}}\n{{nihongo4|Sasuke Uchiha|\u3046\u3061\u306f \u30b5\u30b9\u30b1|Uchiha Sasuke}} is Naruto's rival. He was designed by Kishimoto as the \"cool genius\" since he felt this was an integral part of an ideal rivalry.<ref name=\"Art140\"/> Sasuke's older brother, [[Itachi Uchiha]], killed the rest of their family.{{gnr|ch|224}} <span>Because of this, Sasuke's sole desire is to kill his brother, and he develops a cold and withdrawn personality, seeing people as tools to further his goals, although also gaining the affection of most of the girls he knows, much to his annoyance. After he becomes a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to begin considering his teammates precious to the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing on revenge less than at the start of the series. Following an encounter and a subsequent defeat at the hands of his brother in Part I, however, Sasuke severs his ties and leaves the village to seek more power from a man named Orochimaru. By the events of the ''Boruto'' franchise, Sasuke has become a vigilante investigating the Otsutsuki clan while aiding Konohagakure. Sasuke is voiced by </span>[[Noriaki Sugiyama]]<span> in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is </span>[[Yuri Lowenthal]].\n\n====Sakura Haruno====\n{{main|Sakura Haruno}}\n{{nihongo4|Sakura Haruno|\u6625\u91ce \u30b5\u30af\u30e9|Haruno Sakura}} is a member of Team 7. While creating the character, Kishimoto has admitted that he had little perception of what an ideal girl should be like.<ref name=\"Art140\"/> As a child, Sakura was teased by other children because of her large forehead, a feature Kishimoto tried to emphasize in Sakura's appearance. She was comforted by [[#Ino Yamanaka|Ino Yamanaka]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|page=122|isbn=978-1-4215-1407-9}}</ref> and the two developed a friendship. However, as the two continued to grow, they became increasingly distant due to their shared affection for Sasuke Uchiha. During the early moments of Part I, Sakura is infatuated with Sasuke and resents Naruto Uzumaki, although Sasuke views her as \"annoying\" and Naruto has feelings for her.{{gnr|ch|3}} Her perception on Naruto eventually changes, however, and she comes to see him as a friend, while her feelings for Sasuke grow into deep love. In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is [[Chie Nakamura]], and she is voiced by [[Kate Higgins]] in the English adaptation.<ref name=\"cast2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/naruto/chara/index.html|title=Character|publisher=[[TV Tokyo]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=October 23, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623082548/http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/naruto/chara/index.html|archivedate=June 23, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"threeeng\">{{cite episode|title=Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?|series=Naruto|credits=Studio Pierrot|network=Cartoon Network|airdate=September 17, 2005}}</ref>\n\n====Kakashi Hatake====\n{{main|Kakashi Hatake}}\nKakashi Hatake is the easygoing, smart leader of team 7, consisting of Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno. Kakashi had a dark past, but he didn't let that affect him as an adult. He was a very vital key for Naruto's success, training him to be a great ninja. Kakashi is a master of the Sharingan Mirror Wheel Eye, which he gained as a present from his late friend, Obito Uchiha. Kakashi's original eye was restored late into part 2 of the series. Kakashi is killed by Pain (Nagato), But is revived when Nagato uses Rinne Rebirth to restore everything. Kakashi precedes Tsunade as the sixth Hokage, In the later parts of Naruto Shippuden.\n\n===''Boruto: Naruto Next Generations''===\nThe protagonists of the ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]'' series are Naruto and Hinata's son Boruto Uzumaki, Sasuke and Sakura's daughter [[Sarada Uchiha]], Orochimaru's son [[Mitsuki (Naruto)|Mitsuki]], and Konohamaru Sarutobi who form {{nihongo4|\"Team Konohamaru\"|\u6728\u30ce\u8449\u4e38\u73ed|Konohamaru-Han}}. Prior to their series, Konohamaru was a supporting character in the ''Naruto'' series while Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki were introduced in the ''Naruto'' epilogue{{gnr|ch|700}}.\n\n====Boruto Uzumaki====\n{{main|Boruto Uzumaki}}\n{{nihongo4|Boruto Uzumaki|\u3046\u305a\u307e\u304d \u30dc\u30eb\u30c8|Uzumaki Boruto}} is the son of Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga who attends Konoha's ninja academy, inheriting his paternal family's short blond hair, blue eyes and {{nihongo4|\"Believe it!\"|\u3060\u3063\u3066\u3070\u3055|dattebasa}} verbal tic. He also inherits his maternal family's Gentle Fist technique despite apparently not inheriting the Byakugan unlike his sister, Himawari. Like his father when he used to pull pranks to have his existence be acknowledged, Boruto tends to commit mischief to get his father's attention after he became Hokage by defacing the Hokage Monument during the events of the series epilogue, but his father stops him and explains that he needs to care for their village. Boruto also admires his father's rival and friend Sasuke, seeking his training in order to surpass his father, later being accepted as his student {{gnr|ch|700}}. In ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'', and its retellings, Boruto joins the Chunin Exams along with his best friend Shikadai and their teammates while attempting to cheat his way through the exams. But when Naruto gets abducted by Momoshiki, Boruto makes peace with his father and helps him and Sasuke defeat the Otsutsuki. While deciding to take Sasuke's path as one to aid the Hokage from the shadows, Boruto was branded by a dying Momoshiki with a mark called the Kama. While able to use a Rasengan, Boruto accidentally developed the Vanishing Rasengan as a signature attack. Boruto also can activate a Byakugan-like dojutsu in his right eye, though he cannot activate it at will. In the Japanese version, Boruto is voiced by [[Kokoro Kikuchi]] in  ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]'' and by [[Yuuko Sanpei]] in all subsequent appearances. In the English version, he is voiced by [[Maile Flanagan]] in ''The Last'' and by [[Amanda C. Miller]] in all subsequent appearances.<ref name=\"boruto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-04-06/boruto-naruto-the-movie-sequel-cast-briefly-listed-on-poster/.86801|title=Boruto -Naruto the Movie- Sequel's Cast Briefly Listed on Poster|date=April 6, 2015|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=April 6, 2015|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150407011539/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-04-06/boruto-naruto-the-movie-sequel-cast-briefly-listed-on-poster/.86801|archive-date=April 7, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Sarada Uchiha====\n{{main|Sarada Uchiha}}\n{{nihongo4|Sarada Uchiha|\u3046\u3061\u306f \u30b5\u30e9\u30c0|Uchiha Sarada}} is the daughter of Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno.

His backstory is explored in ''Naruto Gaiden: The Road Illuminated by the Full Moon'', where it is revealed that Mitsuki is an artificial human created by Orochimaru for the latter's interests, gaining the name Mitsuki from the fact that he is a \"vessel\" (\u676f ''Tsuki'') for the \"snake\" (\u5df3 ''Mi'') to inhabit. He was put to the test by Orochimaru and another of his creations called {{nihongo4|Log|\u30ed\u30b0|Rogu}} to determine his allegiance; Mitsuki decided to follow his own path as the \"moon\" instead of a vessel, setting out toward the Hidden Leaf to find his \"sun\": Boruto Uzumaki.

He strives to replace his grandfather as [[#Hokage|Hokage]] so the villagers will recognize him by name, not simply as the Hokage's grandson. He looks to Naruto as a mentor in this quest, emulating his work ethic, determination, and signature jutsu such as the [[Rasengan]] and the Sexy Jutsu among a variety of other techniques. Konohamaru insists, however, that he will only become Hokage after Naruto has been Hokage first.{{gnr|ch|2}} By the events of the series epilogue, Konohamaru has ascended to the rank of jonin and is currently captain of Team Konohamaru.

In stark contrast to his teammates, Kiba is brash, impulsive, and loud-mouthed, and he considers Naruto a rival after Naruto defeated him in the Chunin Exams.

During a fight, she uses the hundreds of weapons stored in scrolls she carries with her to bombard opponents with pinpoint accuracy. Tenten uses this expertise to help [[#Neji Hyuga|Neji Hyuga]] train his defensive techniques, and she holds him in high regard since he can always block her attacks.{{gnr|ch|98}} In the series epilogue, Tenten runs her own weapons shop.

Throughout the series, Kakashi has never displayed a particular interest in their rivalry, which only further motivates Guy to defeat Kakashi and his \"coolness\".{{gnr|ch|65}} Guy is an extremely capable ninja as seen in his fight against Itachi Uchiha and his recurring confrontations with [[#Kisame Hoshigaki|Kisame Hoshigaki]],{{gnr|ch|143}} beating him single-handedly on two occasions.{{gnr|ch|258}}{{gnr|ch|506}} During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Guy is forced to use the Eighth Gate in a failed attempt to defeat Madara. Though Naruto uses the power of the Sage of Six Paths to save his life, Guy's right leg was too damaged to be fully healed. Though he is not wavered from his shinobi career, he remains in a [[paraplegic]] state by the events of the epilogue.\n\nSeries creator Masashi Kishimoto had likened Guy's passionate personality to that of a [[physical education]] teacher he had in junior high school, but notes that the teacher was not a model for Guy's character.<ref name=\"Art143\"/> In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is [[Masashi Ebara]] (who also voices Guy's father, Duy), with Masayuki Makiguchi voicing him as a child.

Because of their interactions with Naruto Uzumaki, and learning their father was murdered by their supposed ally Orochimaru, the Sand Siblings return as allies of Konohagakure, aiding Naruto's group in their attempts to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha from Orochimaru's forces. Kishimoto changed their costumes for their return due to the difficulty in drawing their original attire, as well as to symbolize their new friendship with Konohagakure.<ref>Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, p. 127</ref> In Part II, Gaara becomes Kazekage with his older siblings serving under him as his bodyguards during the Kage Summit at the Land of Iron.\n\n====Gaara====\n{{main|Gaara}}\n{{nihongo4|Gaara|\u6211\u611b\u7f85}} is the youngest of the three siblings, created as a foil to Naruto Uzumaki, with a similar background yet a highly divergent personality.<ref name=\"Art142\"/> Before being born, Gaara was made into a weapon by his father by becoming the Jinchuriki of the [[Ninja World#Tailed Beasts|Tailed Beast]] {{nihongo4|Shukaku the One-Tail|\u4e00\u5c3e\u306e\u5b88\u9db4|Ichibi no Shukaku}}. This act caused the death of his mother during labor and Gaara was placed in the care of his mother's younger brother. Like any other Jinchuriki and because his sand unconsciously attacked those around him when he was threatened, Gaara was tormented by his fellow villagers as well as his uncle.{{gnr|ch|131}} Unlike Naruto, however, Gaara comes to see himself as [[omnipotent]] and that anyone who challenges him or his power must die. When he battles Naruto during the invasion of Konoha, learning that he is also a Jinchuriki like himself, Gaara's outlook changes as he resolves to help others and he succeeds his deceased father as Sunagakure's Fifth Kazekage during Part II.{{gnr|ch|249}} Gaara's Japanese voice actor is [[Akira Ishida]] and his English voice actor is [[Liam O'Brien]].<ref name=\"japcast\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-10-30/voices-by-official-naruto-japanese-cast-confirmed-for-naruto-rise-of-a-ninja-downloadable-content|title=Voices by Official Naruto\u2122 Japanese Cast Confirmed for Naruto: Rise of a Ninja\u2122 Downloadable Content|date=July 30, 2007|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=May 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315211113/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-10-30/voices-by-official-naruto-japanese-cast-confirmed-for-naruto-rise-of-a-ninja-downloadable-content|archive-date=March 15, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-04-14/liam-obrien-guest-of-honour-at-eirtakon-2011|title=Liam O'Brien Guest of Honour At Eirtakon 2011|date=April 14, 2011|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=May 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107110614/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-04-14/liam-obrien-guest-of-honour-at-eirtakon-2011|archive-date=November 7, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Kankuro====\n{{nihongo4|Kankuro|\u30ab\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30a6|Kankur\u014d}} is the middle of the three siblings. For the first half of the series, he is frequently at odds with Gaara, though he tends to hold his tongue for fear of being killed.{{gnr|ch|36}} In Part II, once Gaara begins to reveal his dreams and motivations to Kankuro, Kankuro becomes very protective of Gaara; he lashes out at anyone who speaks poorly of Gaara and when Gaara is kidnapped, he readily risks his life to save him.{{gnr|ch|249}} Kankuro is a talented [[Puppet (Naruto)|puppeteer]], normally using his bladed attack puppet {{nihongo4|Crow|\u70cf|Karasu}} and trapping puppet {{nihongo4|Black Ant|\u9ed2\u87fb|Kuroari}} in combination attacks. He also possesses the large puppet {{nihongo4|Salamander|\u5c71\u6912\u9b5a|Sansh\u014duo}} that provides him with combination defense and offense.

Unlike her more combat-loving brothers, Temari values peace, as she questions Sunagakure's justifications for going to war with Konohagakure.{{gnr|ch|95}} This trait carries over to Part II, in which she begins acting as a liaison between Sunagakure and Konohagakure to help the two villages work together. In her time in Konohagakure, Temari is often seen walking with Shikamaru Nara, causing other characters to think they are dating, although both deny this.{{gnr|ch|247}} In battle, Temari wields a giant [[Japanese war fan|iron fan]] that can create powerful gusts of wind capable of leveling the surrounding landscape. As she is skilled at deducing an opponent's strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins, she typically uses her winds to remove parts of the battlefield that might be advantageous to the enemy.{{gnr|ch|107}} During Part I of the series, Temari is able to use the [[Jutsu (Naruto)#Summoning Jutsu|Summoning Jutsu]], in which she can summon a powerful scythe-wielding [[weasel]] called {{nihongo4|Kamatari|\u30ab\u30de\u30bf\u30ea}}.{{gnr|ch|214}} In the series epilogue, Temari is revealed to have moved to the Hidden Leaf and married Shikamaru, with whom she has a son, Shikadai.{{gnr|ch|700}} Temari's voice actress in the Japanese anime is [[Romi Park]] and her English voice actress is [[Tara Platt]].<ref name=\"plattgibis2\"/><ref name=\"twentyonejap\"/>\n\n===Team Moegi===\n{{nihongo4|Team Moegi|\u30e2\u30a8\u30ae\u73ed|Moegi-Han}} is a group of Konohagakure ninja led by Moegi Kazamatsuri who appears in ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]''.

During the events of ''Boruto: Naruto the Movie'', Shikadai faces Boruto in the Chunin Exam finals and is deemed the winner by default because Boruto was discovered to having cheated during their match.

Because he takes too long to complete the task, his contract is revoked, and his employer tries to have Zabuza killed. Having been redeemed by Naruto, Zabuza kills him first, though is mortally wounded and dies soon afterwards.{{gnr|ch|32}} He is one of the shinobi resurrected by Kabuto to fight on the [[#Akatsuki|Akatsuki]] side and is defeated, being sealed during a rematch with Kakashi.{{gnr|ch|516|, |524}} In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is [[Unsh\u014d Ishizuka]], and his English voice actor is [[Steven Blum]].<ref name=\"blum\"/>\n\n===Haku===\n{{nihongo4|Haku|\u767d}} is Zabuza Momochi's most faithful follower.

After wandering from place to place for a time he was found by Zabuza. Zabuza recognized Haku's talents and agreed to take him in as a tool. As a result, Haku becomes unquestioningly protective of and loyal to Zabuza, and only by being useful does he find a purpose in life.{{gnr|ch|29}} Haku later meets Naruto (who mistakes him for a girl) while he is training, and the two bond over their connections. On this same mission, Haku ultimately gives his life in his mission to save his master from Kakashi's [[Jutsu (Naruto)#Lightning Blade|Lightning Blade]], becoming the first casualty in the series. This is not in vain, however, as a saddened Naruto uses Haku's death to redeem Zabuza.{{gnr|ch|30}}   Episode 17 of the anime greatly expands on Haku's early life, visually showing the scene where Haku discovered his powers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Manga's Cultural Crossroads|last=Gan|first=Sheuo Hui|date=2013|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|isbn=978-1-134-10283-9|location=Hoboken|page=236|chapter=Auteur and Anime as Seen in the Naruto TV Series|editor1-last=Berndt|editor1-first=Jacqueline|editor2-last=K\u00fcmmerling-Meibauer|editor2-first=Bettina}}</ref>  Haku is resurrected by Kabuto Yakushi later in Part 2 of the series to fight in the Fourth Shinobi World War until being sealed by the Allied Shinobi Forces.{{gnr|ch|516|, |524}} His voice actress in the Japanese anime is [[Mayumi Asano]], and his English voice actress is [[Susan Dalian]].

The group was originally known as the \"Sound Five\", but after Kimimaro became bedridden due to his unknown illness, the group resumed calling themselves the Sound Four.{{gnr|ch|201}} As a group they specialize in barriers, defensive walls, sealing techniques as well as possessing their own individual unique [[Jutsu (Naruto)|techniques]] and [[Orochimaru's cursed seals|Curse Marks]] that increase their strengths.{{gnr|ch|184}} The group is composed of:\n*{{nihongo4|Jirobo|\u6b21\u90ce\u574a|Jir\u014db\u014d}}, a large, and quick-tempered, man who specializes in absorbing chakra and close-quarters combat.{{gnr|ch|187}} He is voiced by [[Kenta Miyake]] in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is [[Michael Sorich]].\n*{{nihongo4|Kidomaru|\u9b3c\u7ae5\u4e38|Kid\u014dmaru}}, a six-armed ninja who can produce spider-webs to fight and specialized in ranged combat.{{gnr|ch|192}} He is voiced by [[Susumu Chiba]] in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is [[Peter Lurie]].\n*{{nihongo4|Sakon|\u5de6\u8fd1}} and {{nihongo4|Ukon|\u53f3\u8fd1}} are twin brothers who are the strongest of the Sound Four and count as one member due to their ability to merge their bodies with anyone and kill an opponent at a cellular level.{{gnr|ch|203|,|204}} Both Sakon and Ukon are voiced by [[Shunsuke Sakuya]] in the Japanese anime, while their English voice actor is [[Brian Beacock]].\n*{{nihongo4|Tayuya|\u591a\u7531\u4e5f}}, a female flautist who uses her flute for genjutsu and controlling summoned demons.{{gnr|ch|206}} She is voiced by [[Akeno Watanabe]] in the Japanese anime, while her English voice actress is [[Kari Wahlgren]].\n*{{nihongo4|Kimimaro|\u541b\u9ebb\u5442}}, the last of the Kaguya Clan who has his kin's Kekkei Genkai ability to manipulate his bone structure, called the [[Jutsu (Naruto)#Shikotsumyaku|Shikotsumyaku]], became the leader after he defeated the entire group in battle.

His English voice actor is [[Keith Silverstein]] with [[Kari Wahlgren]] voicing him as a child.\n\nThe Sound Four do not become a prominent part of the story until sent by their leader to escort Sasuke Uchiha to him. Even with Kimimaro joining the group to ensure Sasuke's passage to Orochimaru, the Sound Five all died in the process: Jirobo and Kidomaru killed in their respective fights against Ch\u014dji Akimichi and Neji Hy\u016bga, Sakon and Ukon taken out by Kankuro as they nearly kill Kiba Inuzuka, Tayuya indirectly killed by Temari as she had the upper hand on Shikamaru Nara, and Kimimaro succumbed to his unknown illness in the midst of his battle against Gaara and Rock Lee.{{gnr|ch|184, 217}} During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kimimaro is reanimated by Kabuto Yakushi as a pawn to battle against the Allied Shinobi Forces.{{gnr|ch|515}} In the anime adaptation, unaware that Kabuto brought them back instead of Orochimaru, the Sound Four were also reanimated and were allowed to act on their impulse for revenge against the members of the Sasuke Retrieval group before being defeated. It was also at the time of the war's climax that Kabuto reveals that he assimilated the Sound Five's DNA to access their abilities.{{gnr|ch|585}}\n\n===Akatsuki===\n{{nihongo4|Akatsuki|\u6681||lit. \"Dawn\" or \"Daybreak\"}} is an organization of criminal ninja that serves as the primary antagonistic force of the second part of the ''Naruto'' series. It was founded by Yahiko, [[Pain (Naruto)#Pain|Nagato]] and Konan. After Yahiko's death, it was led by Nagato with [[#Obito Uchiha|Obito]] as his benefactor. The Akatsuki's goal is world domination by using the power of the nine Tailed Beasts, Nagato assuming it was by forcing others to know suffering for true peace to come.{{gnr|ch|239}} But the actual goal is Obito enacting Madara's {{nihongo4|Project Tsuki no Me|\u6708\u306e\u773c\u8a08\u753b|Tsuki no Me Keikaku|literally \"Eye of the Moon Plan\"}}, which involves feeding the Tailed Beasts to the Gedo Statue for it to revert back into the Ten-Tails with Obito becoming its Jinchuriki to subjugate all life by projecting the Infinite Tsukiyomi on the moon's surface. The members of Akatsuki are ninja who have abandoned their villages, and are considered by their former homes to be S-class criminals, the most powerful and wanted ninja in the ''Naruto'' universe. At any given time, Akatsuki is composed of ten members, who operate in two-man teams; it was later reduced to nine after [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]]'s departure. Aside from an attempt by members Itachi Uchiha and [[#Kisame Hoshigaki|Kisame Hoshigaki]] to capture [[#Kurama|Kurama]] (the Nine-Tailed fox sealed within Naruto Uzumaki), Akatsuki is not prominently featured in Part I.{{gnr|ch|143}} In Part II, they take a more active role, capturing [[Gaara]] and extracting the one-tailed tanuki, Shukaku, from his body, as well as working towards capturing the remaining Tailed Beasts.{{gnr|ch|261}} Kishimoto called the Akatsuki's members [[antihero]]es as he wished to expand their backgrounds as much as the ones from the series' protagonists, contrasting them with other types of villains.<ref name=\"kishiintealpha\">{{cite journal|journal=Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha|title=Interview with Masashi Kishimoto (Creator of Naruto)|publisher=Viz Media|issue=2\u201306\u201312|date=February 2012|author=Kido, Misaki C.|pages=120\u2013123}}</ref>\n\n====Obito Uchiha====\n{{main|Obito Uchiha}}\n{{nihongo4|Obito Uchiha|\u3046\u3061\u306f \u30aa\u30d3\u30c8|Uchiha Obito}}, also known under his alias {{nihongo4|Tobi|\u30c8\u30d3}} is the true leader of Akatsuki and the primary antagonist for most of Part II. As a child during the Third Great Ninja War, being Kakashi's teammate in Team Minato, Obito was similar to Naruto in both wanting to become Hokage and unrequited love for his teammate Rin. When he and Kakashi rescue Rin when she was kidnapped by Hidden Stone Ninja during a mission, Obito's right side got crushed in a landslide. Obito believed his death was certain and had Rin transplant his left Sharingan into Kakashi to replace the latter's original left eye. But Obito finds himself saved at the second by Madara and outfitted with Zetsu prosthetics while conditioning him to become his apprentice, the ninja arranging Obito to witness Rin's death as a casualty of war by a reluctant Kakashi to break his spirit. Coming to the conclusion that he can use the Tailed Beasts to destroy the current reality and create a utopia, Obito takes up Madara's name following the latter's death while masking his voice. Obito would then arrange similar events for Nagato with Yahiko's death to create the current incarnation of the Akatsuki.{{gnr|ch|602|, |606}} Obito serves a behind-the-scenes role throughout the first half of Part II while revealed to have caused tragic prior to the series, including Kurama's attack on the Hidden Leaf as revenge on his sensei Minato for not supporting Kakashi to protect Rin{{gnr|ch|501}} Other than being able to use his right Sharingan to manipulate Kamui in a fashion that made it seem he is intangible and [[Teleportation|teleport]] over great distances, Obito can use Wood Style attacks as his prosthetics possess Hashirama's cells.{{gnr|ch|310|, |395}}\n\n====Zetsu====\n{{nihongo4|Zetsu|\u30bc\u30c4}} is the only member of the Akatsuki to regularly act without a partner, also being the only nonhuman member and Obito's right hand. Originally, Kaguya created a shadow-like symbiotic entity known as {{nihongo4|Black Zetsu|\u9ed2\u30bc\u30c4|Kuro Zetsu}} to manipulate her grandson Indra and his descendants throughout history so one among them can manifest a Rinnegan and free his creator. Black Zetsu succeeds with Madara, whom he deceived into believing that he created the entity's host body {{nihongo4|White Zetsu|\u767d\u30bc\u30c4|Shiro Zetsu}}. White Zetsu was originally part of an army that Kaguya was assembling for the purpose of fending off her kinsmen, the result of humans who mutated into drones as a result of being assimilated by the Ten Tails during Kaguya's Infinite Tsukuyomi ages ago. Though he and White Zetsu are effective in their symbiosis, Black Zetsu occasionally argued with his easygoing host. As White Zetsu is an extension of the Shinju, he can merge into the ground or vegetation to quickly travel to a new location or separate himself from the part of his body holding Black Zetsu and uses spores to create clones of himself or whoever he touches.{{gnr|ch|289}} This makes Zetsu not only of use to the Akatsuki as a spy, but also to devour bodies of deceased Akatsuki members or those that the organization does not want found.{{gnr|ch|255, 261}} Another of the White Zetsu that Black Zetsu brought out of the Gedo Statue, initially referred to as {{nihongo4|Guruguru|\u30b0\u30eb\u30b0\u30eb}} due to the spiral-shaped pattern on his body, is later named {{nihongo4|Tobi|\u30c8\u30d3}} and served as an exosuit for Obito while the youth was getting used to his new body. After White Zetsu is killed by Sasuke during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Black Zetsu went into hiding until it later merges itself onto Obito to force the human into resurrecting Madara.{{gnr|ch|575|, |656}} But ultimately, once the Eye of the Moon Plan ran its course, Black Zetsu reveals his true identity and fuses himself onto Madara to convert the human into a new body for Kaguya to inhabit.{{gnr|ch|674}} Black Zetsu then reveals his role in the conflict between the Senju and Uchiha while helping Kaguya deal with Naruto and Sasuke, eventually ripped away from his creator when Naruto severed Kaguya's arm. Seeing Kaguya being sealed away again, Black Zetsu is thrown by Naruto into the forming moon so he would not make another attempt to free his creator.{{gnr|ch|681, 688, 690}} Tobi, having participated in the war by encasing Yamato to access his Wood-Style before ejecting him once Madara succeeds in casting the Infinite Tsukiyomi, is last seen crumbling after the jutsu is canceled with his former captive the only witness to his death.{{gnr|ch|699}}\n\nAs Kishimoto originally planned Akatsuki to be a group of individuals with close to no human characteristics, he decided to make Zetsu half black and half white to emphasize his [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality]].<ref name=\"data3889\"/> In the Japanese anime, Zetsu is voiced by [[Nobuo Tobita]], who also voices the Tobi and the White Zetsu Army.<ref name=\"cd\"/> In episode 134 of the English adaptation, Black Zetsu is voiced by [[Michael Sorich]] and White Zetsu by [[Brian Beacock]], though both in the English ''Shippuden'' anime are voiced by [[Travis Willingham]] alongside Tobi and the White Zetsu Army.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2011-02-24/anime-usa-announces-laura-bailey-and-travis-willingham|title=Anime USA Announces Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham|date=April 24, 2011|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=May 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228040542/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2011-02-24/anime-usa-announces-laura-bailey-and-travis-willingham|archive-date=February 28, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Kisame Hoshigaki====\n{{nihongo4|Kisame Hoshigaki|\u5e72\u67ff \u9b3c\u9bab|Hoshigaki Kisame}} is a former ninja of [[Kirigakure]] and partnered to Itachi Uchiha, having a unique appearance with pale blue skin, a gill-like facial structure, and sharp triangular teeth. While he was still loyal to Kirigakure, Kisame was one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, a group of violent ninja that use particularly large swords in battle. His sword, {{nihongo4|Samehada|\u9bab\u808c|\"Sharkskin\" in Shippuden}}, is a living weapon covered in scales that can absorb untold amounts of an opponent's [[Chakra(Naruto)|chakra]]. Only allowing those it sees as worthy to wield it, Samehada can provide the user with the chakra it holds, ensuring him an infinite amount of stamina. Kisame himself has massive amounts of chakra,{{gnr|ch|142}} and by fusing Samehada into him, Kisame can assume a more shark-like form that increases his abilities. In battle, he frequently shapes water into the forms of sharks to damage opponents.{{gnr|ch|258}} After discarding Samehada when it chose [[#Killer B|Killer Bee]] over him, Kisame is decapitated by Killer Bee and the Raikage using Double Lariat. It is later revealed that the decapitation was just a shapeshifting technique performed by Zetsu; the real Kisame having hidden inside Samehada.{{gnr|ch|487}} He attempts to flee from the ninjas but is defeated by [[#Might Guy|Might Guy]] and captured. Kisame then commits suicide by summoning sharks and allowing them to eat him, but not before using one of them to steal back the information he had compiled and send it to the Akatsuki.{{gnr|ch|508}} His voice actor in the Japanese anime is [[Tomoyuki Dan]];<ref name=\"cd\"/> in English, he is voiced at first by [[Michael McConnohie]], later by [[Kirk Thornton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kirkthornton.com/KIRKTHORNTON.COM/VO_Resume.html|title=VO Resume|accessdate=February 11, 2016|publisher=Kirk Thornton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619012949/http://kirkthornton.com/KIRKTHORNTON.COM/VO_Resume.html|archive-date=June 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Konan====\n{{nihongo4|Konan|\u5c0f\u5357}} is the only [[kunoichi|female ninja]] in Akatsuki. As such, Kishimoto originally wanted her to have an obscene appearance showing more of her bust.<ref name=\"data3889\"/> Being the partner of [[List of Naruto characters#Nagato|Pain]], Konan was also a pupil under Jiraiya after she was orphaned as a child by one of Amegakure's many wars and forced to fend for herself. Because she serves under Pain, she is referred to by villagers of Amegakure as \"God's angel\". While under Jiraiya, Konan learned to take advantage of her natural talent with [[origami]], using it as a key component in her battle style.{{gnr|ch|373|, |449}} Konan can divide her body into countless sheets of paper, which she controls and reshapes remotely to scout out an area, form weapons for attack, or create wings that mirror her title. While Konan's abilities are restricted when the paper is wet, since paper will cling to itself and lose its stiffness, she is able to use this weakness to her advantage as she implements explosive tags into her paper clones. After Nagato's death, Konan withdraws her position in Akatsuki and proclaims loyalty to Naruto.{{gnr|ch|372}} Later, she is confronted by Obito over the location of Nagato's Rinnegan eyes. She fights him in a suicide assault, though is killed after being forced to reveal Nagato's resting place. The last thing she sees the endless rain of Amegakure stop for the first time.{{gnr|ch|510}} In the Japanese anime, Konan is voiced by [[Atsuko Tanaka (voice actress)|Atsuko Tanaka]] and in the English anime, her voice actress is [[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]].<ref name=\"cd\"/><ref name=\"setten\">{{cite video | people=| date=April 10, 2012 | title=Naruto Shippuden 10 | medium=DVD | location= | publisher=Viz Media}}</ref>\n\n====Nagato====\n<!--Do not rename this section to \"Pain\" without establishing consensus on the talk page; that is an alias.-->\n{{main|Nagato (Naruto)}}\n{{nihongo4|Nagato|\u9577\u9580}}, primarily known under the alias of {{nihongo4|Pain|\u30da\u30a4\u30f3|Pein}}, is the recognized leader of Akatsuki and partner of [[#Konan|Konan]], with Obito acting as his benefactor.{{gnr|ch|510}} The \"Pain\" that is most often seen in the series and used is the Deva Path, which is actually Nagato's deceased friend, {{nihongo4|Yahiko|\u5f25\u5f66}}, one of six animated corpses collectively known as {{nihongo4|\"The Six Paths of Pain\"|\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u516d\u9053|Pein Rikud\u014d}}, that are all controlled by Nagato and use one sixth of his full power.{{gnr|ch|378|, |419}} The Pain Paths are all outfitted with a number of body piercings that serve as a means for Nagato to control them and to give them a \"more dangerous\" appearance in relation to their name's installation.<ref name=\"data3889\">{{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=Naruto Character Official Data Book Hiden Sha no Sho|year=2008|publisher=Shueisha|isbn=978-4-08-874247-2|pages=348\u2013349}}</ref>\n\n====Itachi Uchiha====\n{{main|Itachi Uchiha}}\n{{nihongo4|Itachi Uchiha|\u3046\u3061\u306f \u30a4\u30bf\u30c1|Uchiha Itachi}} is a former ninja of Konohagakure and the partner of Kisame Hoshigaki. Though having spent his early youth as the child prodigy of the Uchiha clan, Itachi is treated as a villain for much of the series.

He was a terrorist bomber-for-hire before Itachi Uchiha forced him to join Akatsuki. Though he came to embrace the organization, Deidara still holds a grudge against Itachi and all other Uchihas throughout the series, as he feels their Sharingan eyes look down on his artwork.{{gnr|ch|359}} Upon joining the Akatsuki, he is partnered with [[#Sasori|Sasori]], who is subsequently replaced by [[#Obito Uchiha|Tobi]] after his death. Though he abuses Tobi when he annoys him, Deidara becomes more like a teacher to him, and adopts a genuine care for his well-being.{{gnr|ch|366}} Both of Deidara's hands have mouths on them that, by infusing clay or other fine-grained minerals with chakra, create \"sculptures\", bombs that explode with varying intensities. Deidara's bombs can take any form he chooses, and from the time of their creation to their detonation, he can animate and control them remotely.{{gnr|ch|248}} Sasuke Uchiha, Itachi's younger brother, is able to systematically nullify his bombs in combat, and so Deidara transforms himself into a [[Suicide attack|living bomb]] in a last effort to kill Sasuke and to prove the supremacy of his art, but fails in the attempt.{{gnr|ch|363}} He is later resurrected by Kabuto for the war against the Shinobi Alliance but is defeated by Kankuro.{{gnr|ch|520}} His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Katsuhiko Kawamoto.<ref name=\"casttvtokyo\">{{cite web |url=http://pierrot.jp/title/naruto/staff.html |title=Cast |publisher=[[TV Tokyo]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=October 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118063957/http://pierrot.jp/title/naruto/staff.html |archivedate=January 18, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In his cameo appearance in episode 135 of the English adaptation, he is voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]],<ref name=\"flynn\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-03-16/am2-announces-a-list-voice-actor-quinton-flynn-as-a-guest-of-honor-for-2012-anime-manga-and-music-event-this-june-15-17-2012-at-the-anaheim-convention-center-and-anaheim-hilton|title=AM2 Announces A-List Voice Actor Quinton Flynn As A Guest of Honor For 2012 Anime, Manga, and Music Event This June 15\u201317, 2012 At The Anaheim Convention Center And Anaheim Hilton|publisher=Anime News Network|date=March 16, 2012|accessdate=March 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009053609/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-03-16/am2-announces-a-list-voice-actor-quinton-flynn-as-a-guest-of-honor-for-2012-anime-manga-and-music-event-this-june-15-17-2012-at-the-anaheim-convention-center-and-anaheim-hilton|archive-date=October 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and in the anime of ''Shippuden'' by [[Roger Craig Smith]].\n\n====Hidan====\n{{nihongo4|Hidan|\u98db\u6bb5}} is the immortal, foul-mouthed, and sadomasochistic partner of [[#Kakuzu|Kakuzu]] and a former ninja of Yugakure, the Village Hidden in Boiling Water.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=Naruto Character Official Data Book Hiden Sha no Sho|year=2008|publisher=Shueisha|isbn=978-4-08-874247-2|page=145}}</ref> He is a member of the {{nihongo4|Way of Jashin|\u30b8\u30e3\u30b7\u30f3||lit. \"evil god\"}} religion which worships a deity of the same name and believes that anything less than death and utter destruction in battle is considered a sin.{{gnr|ch|313}} His religion's experimentations have led to the creation of his unique abilities; by consuming an opponent's blood and then drawing Jashin's triangular symbol on the ground, Hidan can create a link with his opponent.

However, motivated by his desire to make works that last forever, Sasori secretly devised a way to convert the corpses of humans into puppets, allowing him to use any of the [[Jutsu (Naruto)|ninja abilities]] they possessed during their lives for himself. Leaving Sunagakure in his teenage, Sasori later kidnapped the Third Kazekage, transforming him into a human puppet and using him as his main weapon.{{gnr|ch|267}} Sasori's desire was to become art, so he converted his own body into a puppet, which essentially gives him eternal life and allows him to control hundreds of puppets at once.{{gnr|ch|271}} After joining the Akatsuki, Sasori was paired with [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]], and after his desertion, he was teamed with Deidara, who looks up to him and his artistic knowledge with reverence.{{gnr|ch|248}} {{gnr|ch|263}} In the Akatsuki, Sasori spent most of the time hidden inside Hiruko, a human puppet who served as both weapon and armour, which he adorned with Akatsuki's robe.

He is very arrogant about his immense battle prowess. Though he was a childhood friend of Hashirama amidst the conflicts of their respective clan, their friendship ends as a result of the war. As the leader of the Uchiha clan, Madara's overuse of [[Jutsu (Naruto)#Mangekyo Sharingan|Mangekyo Sharingan]] blinds him, forcing him to take the eyes of his late younger brother Izuna. This allows Madara to use his newly awakened Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan to continue the ongoing war between the Uchiha and the Senju.{{gnr|ch|386}} In later years, Hashirama comes forth with a peace offering between the two clans. Though he agrees to have peace with his former rival, Madara feels he would never be accepted by the Senju and loses hope in Hashirama.

Having successfully manipulated Madara Uchiha into eventually casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi while having the Ten-Tails corpse absorbed by the Uchiha, Black Zetsu betrays Madara and converts him into a vessel for Kaguya to inhabit. From there, deeming Naruto and Sasuke a threat because they are the current reincarnations of her grandsons and because of their resemblance to her own children, Kaguya takes Team 7 and Obito into her dimensional realms to kill them there. However, after being overpowered by Naruto and Sasuke and with the help of Sakura's punch, Kaguya is resealed with the tailed beasts and Madara extracted from her body.{{gnr|ch|646|, |647}} Kaguya is voiced by [[Mami Koyama]] in Japanese and by [[Cissy Jones]] in the English dub.<ref>[[Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]</ref>\n\n====Toneri \u014ctsutsuki====\n{{nihongo4|Toneri \u014ctsutsuki|\u5927\u7b52\u6728 \u30c8\u30cd\u30ea|\u014ctsutsuki Toneri}} is the antagonist of ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]'', a descendant of Hamura \u014ctsutsuki whose family left the world and live on the moon to maintain the imprisonment of the Gedo Statue.

The character is voiced by [[Ikuko Tani]] in the Japanese anime,<ref name=\"casttvtokyo\"/> and by [[Barbara Goodson]] in the English dub.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbaragoodson.com/resume.php|title=Resume|publisher=A Woman of many Hats|author=Goodson, Barbara|accessdate=May 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405195529/http://www.barbaragoodson.com/resume.php|archive-date=April 5, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Kumogakure===\n====A====\n{{nihongo4|A|\u30a8\u30fc|\u0112}} is the {{nihongo4|Fourth Raikage|\u56db\u4ee3\u76ee\u96f7\u5f71|Yondaime Raikage}}. A fierce man with extreme conviction, A's only somewhat soft spot is his love for his younger adoptive brother, Killer Bee. He is the son of the Third Raikage, groomed especially to succeed him, and believes that ninja must always show resolve even when they are defeated. He is also considered by many to be the fastest ninja in the world following Minato's death, up until when Naruto is able to dodge his attacks. A would later fight in the Third Shinobi World War, where he would frequently fight with Minato Namikaze, only for all of their battles to create stalemates.{{gnr|ch|542}} After Killer Bee is seemingly abducted by Taka, A resolves to kill Sasuke and ridicules Naruto for trying to defend him. He and Sasuke later fight at the Five Kage Summit, during which A loses his left arm;{{gnr|ch|464}} after learning the truth about Killer Bee, he helps him defeat Kisame.{{gnr|ch|473}} A eventually becomes the Supreme Commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces, and after allowing Naruto and Killer Bee to fight in the war once they defeat him, fights and loses against Madara. Sometime between the war's end and the series epilogue, he steps down as Raikage and is succeeded by Darui. A is voiced by [[Hideaki Tezuka]] in Japanese and by [[Beau Billingslea]] in English.\n\n====Darui====\n{{nihongo4|Darui|\u30c0\u30eb\u30a4}} is a Kumogakure ninja who serves as one of the bodyguards for the Fourth Raikage during the Kage Summit. In contrast to his master, he is easygoing and tends to apologize, which the Raikage chastises him for. He is taught by the Third Raikage on the arts of black lightning, shaping it in the form of black panther, and also possesses the Storm Style kekkei genkai, a mixture of lightning and water elements that forms flowing lightning. During the Fourth Ninja War, Darui leads the First Division specializing in mid-range battles. Sometime between the war's end and the series epilogue, he becomes the {{nihongo4|Fifth Raikage|\u4e94\u4ee3\u76ee\u96f7\u5f71|Godaime Raikage}}. During Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Darui goes to the Leaf Village to oversee the Chunnin Exams. He is voiced by Ryota Takeuchi in the Japanese anime and Catero Colbert in the English dub, though [[Ogie Banks]] replaces the latter for the ''Ultimate Ninja Storm'' series of video games.\n\n====Karui====\n{{nihongo4|Karui|\u30ab\u30eb\u30a4}} is one of Killer Bee's subordinates, a part of Team Samui. She is greatly worried by her teacher's disappearance following his fight with Taka and visits Konohagakure with her team in order to find him. A passionate and bold young woman, she quickly becomes involved in an altercation with Team Kakashi, blaming them for befriending and defending Sasuke Uchiha. She even proceeds to brutally punch Naruto in the face repeatedly after he allows her to do so as compensation for not giving up information on Sasuke. Karui is assigned as part of the Second Division during the Fourth Ninja War. Sometime after the war ends, she moves to Konohagakure and marries Choji Akimichi, giving birth to their daughter Chocho, who is an academy student in the series epilogue.{{gnr|ch|700}} Kauri is voiced by [[Yuka Komatsu]] in the Japanese anime. In the English dub, [[Danielle Nicolet]] voices the character in ''Naruto'' and Sascha Alexander in ''Boruto: Naruto Next Generations''.\n\n===Kirigakure===\n====Mei Terumi====\n{{nihongo4|Mei Terumi|\u7167\u7f8e \u30e1\u30a4|Terum\u012b Mei}} is the {{nihongo4|Fifth Mizukage|\u4e94\u4ee3\u76ee\u6c34\u5f71|Godaime Mizukage}} of the [[Ninja World#Land of Water|Kirigakure]]. She possesses two kekkei genkai: the Lava Style, a combination of fire and earth elements that allows her to spit lava, and Vapor Style, which mixes fire and water to create corrosive mist. She is apparently relatively new to the position and does not remember the previous leadership, which conducted witch hunts against kekkei genkai users like her, fondly. During the Kage Summit, Mei acts rather dodgy when asked about rumors that [[List of Naruto characters#Akatsuki|Akatsuki]] formed in her village, and when she finds out Danzo is capable of mind control she suspects him of using it on the previous Mizukage. She manages to nearly kill Sasuke during the meeting and initially helps guard the daimy\u014d of the Shinobi Countries during the preparation for the Fourth Ninja War. During the war, Mei fights the revived Madara Uchiha with the other Kages, though despite their impressive teamwork, they still end up losing to Madara's might. Years after the war comes to an end and during some point at the epilogue, Mei passes down her title to her former bodyguard Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d.

She is voiced by Yurika Hino in the Japanese anime, and by [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]] in the English adaptation.\n\n====Chojuro====\n{{nihongo4|Chojuro|\u9577\u5341\u90ce|Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d}} is one of [[List of Naruto characters#Mei Terumi|Mei Terumi]]'s bodyguards, with the other being [[List of Naruto characters#Ao|Ao]]. He is one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, carrying the sword {{nihongo4|Hiramekarei|\u30d2\u30e9\u30e1\u30ab\u30ec\u30a4}}, but after [[List of Naruto characters#Zabuza Momochi|Zabuza Momochi]] and [[List of Naruto characters#Kisame Hoshigaki|Kisame Hoshigaki]] are killed, he becomes the only real one left of the Swordsmen; in addition, he is the only one affiliated with the village at the beginning of the series. Chojuro frequently annoys Ao because he stutters and seems to lack self-confidence. After accompanying the Mizukage to the Kage Summit, he helps her guard the daimy\u014d of the Shinobi Countries, and is able to gain enough self-confidence to help Naruto defeat Black Zetsu. He later becomes the {{nihongo4|Sixth Mizukage|\u516d\u4ee3\u76ee\u6c34\u5f71|Rokudaime Mizukage}} sometime after the war. In the Japanese anime, he is voiced by [[Kouki Miyata]], while [[Brian Beacock]] provides his voice in the English adaptation.\n\n====Ao====\n{{nihongo4|Ao|\u9752}} is one of Mei Terumi's bodyguards. He is a middle-aged ninja who wears an eyepatch on his right eye, a Byakugan he acquired from a main house Hyuga, and is often critical of Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d's indecisiveness due to his upbringing during Hidden Mist Village's \"Blood Mist\" days. When Mifune suggests [[List of Naruto characters#Danzo Shimura|Danzo Shimura]] to lead the inter-village effort against Akatsuki, Ao reveals his Byakugan to confirm that Danzo's eye and arm belonged to [[List of Naruto characters#Shisui Uchiha|Shisui Uchiha]], whom he fought and aware of the Uchiha's ability to covertly manipulate others. Ao then goes after Danzo's group when they flee during Taka's attack, only to saved by Mei and Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d when he fell into a trap that Danzo's men set up in an attempt to retrieve his Byakugan. Ao serves in the Allied Shinobi Forces as captain of the Sensor Division stationed in the Shinobi Alliance Headquarters in Kumogakure, barely surviving the Ten Tails' Tailed Beast Bomb when it obliterated their base. As later revealed have survived in ''Boruto: Naruto Next Generations'', his body augmented with Shinobi-Ware prosthetics that include a Type-3 Shinobi Gauntlet replacing his left forearm, an older Ao had become a sleeper agent for the Kara. He engaged Team Konohamaru and Katasuke, using of the latter's inventions to kill his aide while wounded Konohamaru. A revenge-driven Boruto manages to outwit and overpower Ao, sparing the man's life as Ao ends up sacrificing himself to save Boruto from being crushed by Kashin Koji's Boiler Toad. He is voiced by Tadahisa Saizen in the Japanese anime, while [[Steven Blum]] voices him in the English adaptation.\n\n====Gengetsu Hozuki====\n{{nihongo4|Gengetsu Hozuki|\u9b3c\u706f \u5e7b\u6708|H\u014dzuki Gengetsu}} was the {{nihongo4|Second Mizukage|\u4e8c\u4ee3\u76ee\u6c34\u5f71|Nidaime Mizukage}} of Kirigakure. A very tall mustached man with large poofy hair, curious way of dressing and with no eyebrows, he was laid back and very charismatic leader concerned with the welfare of his village.{{gnr|ch|546}} He loathed the Second Tsuchikage and their final confrontation with each other resulted in their mutual deaths.{{gnr|ch|525}} Gengetsu is brought back to life by Kabuto's resurrection technique to face the Shinobi Alliance in the Fourth Ninja War. Like other members of the Hozuki clan, he mastered hydrification technique, which manifests itself as an oily, water like substance.{{gnr|ch|548}} He is voiced by [[Hideyuki Umezu]] in the Japanese anime, while [[Jamieson Price]] voices him in the English adaptation.\n\n===Iwagakure===\n====Onoki====\n{{nihongo4|Onoki|\u30aa\u30aa\u30ce\u30ad|\u014cnoki}} was the {{nihongo4|Third Tsuchikage|\u4e09\u4ee3\u76ee\u571f\u5f71|Sandaime Tsuchikage}} of the [[Ninja World#Land of Earth|Iwagakure]], the grandson of the First Tsuchikage Ishikawa, and a protege of his predecessor Mu with longest reign as Kage that allowed him to personally meet many figures long dead in the present, including Madara Uchiha.{{gnr|ch|469}} He possesses the Particle Style, a kekkei tota that combines Fire, Earth, and Wind elements to create three-dimensional shapes capable of disintegrating anything it touches, as well as the ability to alter gravity, enabling him flight. He is very proud, despite his frailty,{{gnr|ch|454}} and shows little respect to those much younger than him. During the Kage Summit, he admitted to have frequently hired Akatsuki.{{gnr|ch|458}}{{gnr|ch|459}} While Onoki justify hiring the Akatsuki as necessary in protecting his village during its demilitarization, both it and his advanced age kept him from being named leader of the Shinobi Alliance though Sasuke's intrusion and Gaara's conduct cause Onoki to regain some of more noble traits from his youth. Later, he goes out to find Kabuto and prevent him from finding Killer Bee and Naruto and succeeds in protecting them. Throughout the war, Onoki's techniques proved instrumental in keeping Alliance members alive and he becomes the de facto leader in the assault against the real Madara Uchiha. Years later, Onoki retires due to his failing health and passes down his title to his granddaughter, Kurotsuchi. In the ''Boruto'' series, following an attack on his village by a rogue ninja a decade after the Fourth Great Ninja War that took the life of his grandson Kozuchi, Onoki began to develop the Akuta as a defense force to keep people safe and unharmed. He continued perfecting the process after receiving a White Zetsu's remains, improving on the Akuta while creating Fabrications like his partial clone son K\u016b as he orchestrated Mitsuki's abduction to refine the process. But upon seeing the extent the Fabrications would go to see his ideals realized, Onoki helps Boruto stop the artificial humans at the cost of his life. Onoki is voiced by [[Tomomichi Nishimura]] in the Japanese anime and [[Steven Blum]] in the English adaptation.\n\n====Kurotsuchi====\n{{nihongo4|Kurotsuchi|\u9ed2\u30c4\u30c1}} is Onoki's granddaughter and his bodyguard during the Kage Summit. She is a kunoichi who favors her village's best interests greatly, even once advising Onoki to kill Naruto and Killer Bee so as to avoid seeing them fall to the Akatsuki. She was also an acquaintance of Deidara before his defection to Akatsuki. Kurotsuchi participates in the Fourth Ninja War, serving in the Second Division under her father, Kitsuchi. She survives the war and becomes the {{nihongo4|Fourth Tsuchikage|\u56db\u4ee3\u76ee\u571f\u5f71|Yondaime Tsuchikage}} by the series epilogue, replacing her ailing grandfather. She is voiced by Hana Takeda in the Japanese anime and [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] in the English adaptation and is also voiced by Cherami Leigh in ''Boruto: Naruto Next Generations''.\n\n====Akatsuchi====\n{{nihongo4|Akatsuchi|\u8d64\u30c4\u30c1}} is one of Onoki's bodyguards accompanying him for the Kage Summit. He is a portly and jovial man who is nevertheless loyal and dedicated to his master. Despite his big size, he moves fast and excels in Earth Style, using it to form golems. Like Kurotsuchi, he was a friend of Deidara before his defection to Akatsuki. Akatsuchi participates in and survives the Fourth Ninja War, continuing to serve as the Tsuchikage's personal bodyguard well over into Kurotsuchi's reign. He is voiced by [[Kenta Miyake]] in Japanese and by [[Kyle Hebert]] in English.\n\n===Kurama===\n{{nihongo4|Kurama|\u4e5d\u5587\u561b}}, often called the {{nihongo4|Nine-Tails|\u4e5d\u5c3e\u306e\u5996\u72d0|Ky\u016bbi no Y\u014dko|lit. [[Kitsune|Nine-Tailed Fox]]}}, is the most powerful of the Tailed Beasts. Used by Madara in his attempt to wipe out Konohagakure at the time of its foundation, Kurama is defeated and sealed within Hashirama's wife and then transferred to Kushina Uzumaki two generations later. Through Obito's scheme, Kurama is released and attacks Konohagakure before being stopped by the [[#Minato Namikaze|Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze]], who seals the fox's Yin half within himself. Following this, Minato and Kushina sacrifice themselves to seal the weakened Yang Kurama within their son, Naruto Uzumaki, twelve years before the series' start.{{gnr|ch|1}}{{gnr|ch|500}} Throughout the series, Naruto tries to harness Kurama's immense chakra to perform several jutsu that would normally be impossible for a shinobi of his age.{{gnr|ch|95}} But Naruto soon learns that relying too much on Kurama's power would allow the fox to impose its will over its host to the point of breaking the seal. Naruto eventually takes control of the fox's chakra with help from an imprint of Kushina.{{gnr|ch|499}} During Naruto's fight against Obito, seeing its host's resolve to save the other Tailed Beasts, Kurama befriends Naruto by allowing him to achieve Tailed Beast Mode.{{gnr|ch|571}} Eventually, as Kurama is extracted from Naruto, the Tailed Beast tells Gaara how to save Naruto's life by transferring Yin Kurama from Minato into Naruto. Kurama is later returned to its Jinchuriki's body and becomes whole again as it reunites with its Yin counterpart. Kishimoto was mainly inspired to create Kurama based on the [[Yoko Kurama|character with the same name]] from the manga series ''[[YuYu Hakusho]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|authorlink=Masashi Kishimoto|title=NARUTO\u2015\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8\u2015[\u79d8\u4f1d\u00b7\u7686\u306e\u66f8]\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30d7\u30ec\u30df\u30a2\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3BOOK|series=Naruto|date=December 4, 2009|publisher=Shueisha|location=Japan|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-08-874834-4|pages=74\u201381}}</ref> The inclusion of the fox spirit was also inspired by [[Godzilla]].<ref name=\"nippon.com\">{{cite web|title=Farewell, Naruto: The Curtain Closes on the World\u2019s Best-Loved Ninja|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/views/b00114/|publisher=Nippon Communications Foundation|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en|date=26 December 2014|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150113014354/http://www.nippon.com/en/views/b00114/|archive-date=13 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the Japanese anime, Kurama's voice actor is [[Tessh\u014d Genda]], and in the English adaptation, he is voiced by [[Paul St. Peter]].<ref name=\"fifty-six\">{{cite episode|title=\u751f\u304b\u6b7b\u304b!?\u514d\u8a31\u7686\u4f1d\u306f\u547d\u61f8\u3051!|series=Naruto|credits=Studio Pierrot|network=TV Tokyo|airdate=October 29, 2003}}</ref><ref name=\"efifty-six\">{{cite episode|title=Live or Die!

The group gets split up after their attempt at terrorizing the Five Kage Summit, but they later reunite as part of the Allied Shinobi Forces. Following the war, they went back to Otogakure along with Orochimaru.\n\n====Suigetsu Hozuki====\n{{nihongo4|Suigetsu Hozuki|\u9b3c\u706f\u6c34\u6708|Hozuki Suigetsu}} is the first member to join. Originally from Kirigakure, his goal is to claim all of the swords wielded by the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, and from there reform the organization in memory of his late brother Mangetsu, who was a member himself{{gnr|ch|523}}. Although his dream was initially cut short by Orochimaru, after Sasuke freed him he managed to claim Zabuza's sword, but lost it while battling the Kage. Suigetsu tends to have a sadistic personality, constantly fascinating about cutting things and consequently getting on Karin's nerves, yet sees himself as normal in comparison to most other people. His clan has the ability to turn any part of their body into water, but must stay hydrated to do so{{gnr|ch|347}}. Suigetsu is voiced by [[Takashi Kondou|Takashi Kondo]] in Japanese and by [[Grant George]] in the English dub except in ''Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals'', where he is voiced by [[Todd Haberkorn]].\n\n====Karin====\n{{nihongo4|Karin|\u9999\u71d0}} is the second member of Taka and a member of the Uzumaki Clan that Naruto belongs to.

After briefly encountering Sasuke during the Chunin Exams, she became addicted to him and decided to join Taka to be at his side.{{gnr|ch|482}} Karin was critically wounded by Sasuke during his battle against Danzo, and after he left her behind, Karin was arrested by Kakashi, in turn meeting Naruto for the first time{{gnr|ch|486}}. She later met up with Sasuke to confront him, but instead immediately forgave him. Sometime after, she moved on from Sasuke due to wanting him to be happy and helped deliver Sasuke and Sakura's daughter, Sarada. Karin is a Sensor Type, able to sense other's chakra and feel a person's aura that way, such as seeing Naruto's chakra as \"bright and warm\". She also can heal people if they bite her, which causes them to absorb chakra, leaving permanent marks all over her body, but due to the risks involved she can only use it once per day. In Japanese, Karin is voiced by [[Kanako T\u014dj\u014d]] up until Episode 485, when Toa Yukinari takes over. In English, she is voiced by [[Ali Hillis]] except in ''Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals'', where she is voiced by [[Michelle Ruff]].\n\n====Jugo====\n{{nihongo4|Jugo|\u91cd\u543e|J\u016bgo}} is the third member of Taka. His clan has the ability to use senjutsu, but due to the severe amount of natural energy they absorb they are prone to fits of extreme violence, with additional side effects being that they can revert to a childlike form if they use it the wrong way. Because of this, in childhood, Jugo was an outcast, eventually finding solace in Kimimaro whom he saw as an older sibling.{{gnr|ch|414}} After meeting Sasuke, he tried to refuse being part of Taka and used his abilities, but Sasuke managed to calm him down. As Kimimaro was the only other person who could do this, Jugo decided to follow Sasuke in the belief that he was Kimimaro's reincarnation.{{gnr|ch|414}} Jugo is voiced by [[Shuhei Sakaguchi]] in Japanese and by [[Travis Willingham]] in the English dub except in ''Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals'', where he is voiced by [[Patrick Seitz]] and is also voiced by Kyle Hebert in ''Boruto: Naruto Next Generations''.\n\n===Danzo Shimura===\n{{redirect|Danzo|16th century ninja|Kat\u014d Danz\u014d}}\n{{nihongo4|Danzo Shimura|\u5fd7\u6751 \u30c0\u30f3\u30be\u30a6|Shimura Danz\u014d}} is one of the oldest villagers in Konohagakure, and a moderately cantankerous [[war hawk]] who was Hiruzen's rival whom he consequently opposed along with the other Hokage for placing world peace above their village's best interests.{{gnr|ch|285}} As Hiruzen obtained the Third Hokage title, Danzo uses the Foundation and his own personal Root [[black ops]] to secretly oversee their village's security along with his personal goal to become a Hokage.{{gnr|ch|298}} This led to Danzo being responsible for events that included Kabuto's defection and orchestrating the Uchiha Massacre. The latter event result in him having the transplanted right eye of Shisui Uchiha, whom he killed, along with having Orochimaru using Shin's genetic makeup to graft Danzo's right arm with a large number of Sharingan eyes and Hashirama's cells. Following Pain's attack devastating Konohagakure, Danzo took advantage of Tsunade's coma in convincing the Fire Country's [[Daimy\u014d|feudal lord]] to make him Acting {{nihongo4|Candidate Sixth Hokage|\u516d\u4ee3\u76ee\u706b\u5f71\u5019\u88dc|Rokudaime Hokage Kouho}} and uses his position to decree Sasuke a wanted criminal before attaining the Five Kage summit to convince the formation of the Shinobi alliance with himself as its leader. But the plan fails as Danzo ends up being fatally wounded after being forced to fight Sasuke, using the last of his strength in an attempted sealing jutsu on his killer and Obito.{{gnr|ch|481}} Though the jutsu failed, Danz\u014d destroyed Shisui's Sharingan to ensure Tobi would not obtain it. With Danzo's death, the Foundation was disbanded in the aftermath of the Fourth Great Ninja War with its members allowed to live in peace while integrating back into society.

Rin realized the scheme while being rescued and jumped in the way of Kakashi's Lightning Blade to save the village at the cost of her life, which is later revealed to have been orchestrated by Madara to break Obito's spirit.{{gnr|ch|604, 630}} Obito later learns upon his death that Rin's spirit has always been waiting for him, and later guides him to the other side after he metaphysically helps Kakashi one last time in his team's battle against Kaguya.

Shisui intended to use Kotoamatsukami to stop the Uchiha's coup when [[Danzo Shimura|Danzo]] stole one of his eyes, giving his other eye to Itachi to protect the village to his stead as he commits suicide and later found on the river by Uchiha military policemen and assuming Shisui was murdered by Itachi. Danzo had the eye transplanted into him so he can manipulate others like Mifune to achieve his goals, later destroying it in his final moments to prevent Tobi from taking it. The eye given to Itachi, on the other hand, is placed in one of his crows and intended for it to be used by Naruto against Sasuke as a means to stop him from attacking the village. But a reanimated Itachi is forced to use it on himself to break free from Kabuto's control, quickly destroying the eye to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is [[Hidenobu Kiuchi]], while his voice actor in the English adaptation is Nicolas Roye.\n\n===Kawaki===\n{{nihongo4|Kawaki|\u30ab\u30ef\u30ad|Kawaki}} is a tattooed youth who became a member of Kara after being brought by Jigen from a drunkard father, bearing a tattoo of the Roman numeral IX under his left eye and bestowed a Kama mark by Jigen to be made into a living weapon for Kara. He was heavily modified with microscopic Shinobi-Ware implanted in his body that give him abilities similar to Jugo's Sage Transformation in altering his physiology at a cellular level. For reasons yet to be revealed, Kawaki left Kara and encountered Boruto who brings him to the Hidden Leaf as he lives with the Uzumaki family. The two would end up becoming enemies as hinted in prologue of the ''Boruto'' series, an older Kawaki appearing to have perpetrated Konoha's destruction as he confronts an older Boruto while declaring the age of shinobi has come to an end.\n\n==Reception==\nThe characters of ''Naruto'' have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Active Anime lauded the characters for not being \"simple cardboard cut-out characters\" due to their \"fleshed out personalities\" and \"underlying dramatic motivations\", and praised the \"deeply moving emotional trials\" they undergo over the course of the series.<ref name=\"ActiveAnimeReview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.activeanime.com/pn/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=3414|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728170141/http://www.activeanime.com/pn/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=3414|archivedate=July 28, 2008|title=ActiveAnime.com :: NARUTO UNCUT BOX SET 1 (ADVANCE REVIEW)|publisher=Active Anime|date=July 3, 2006|accessdate=March 27, 2008}}</ref> Adam Cook of Anime Boredom agreed with this assessment, extolling the characters as \"well rounded\" and \"imaginative\", and celebrated how the characters allowed the series to successfully incorporate comedy, action, and drama together in a believable manner.<ref name=\"AnimeBoredomReview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.homemademech.com/anime-reviews/naruto/191/|title=Naruto anime reviews|publisher=Anime Boredom|author=Cook, Adam|date=May 20, 2004|accessdate=March 30, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013204943/http://www.homemademech.com/anime-reviews/naruto/191/|archivedate=October 13, 2006}}</ref> Christina Ross of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews disagreed, dismissing the characters as echoes of stereotypical ''sh\u014dnen'' characters, and noted that several of the characters were not likable.<ref name=\"THEMAnimeReviews\"/> A second review from Derrick Tucker, also of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews offered a more positive view, commenting that Naruto Uzumaki combined the finer values of his ''sh\u014dnen'' predecessors, but lamented how the characters' personalities tended to fall between Naruto's \"charisma and coolness\" and Sasuke's \"blandness\", making it difficult to think about the characters on \"any deep or meaningful level\".<ref name=\"THEMAnimeReviews2\"/> Justin Rich of the entertainment website Mania asserted that the series lacked the \"tremendous depth in {{sic|it|'s|nolink=y|expected=its}} characters\" or \"the most flushed out backgrounds\" seen in other ''sh\u014dnen'' series, and believed the primary strength of the series was the fighting.<ref name=\"AnimeOnDVDReviewDVD4\"/> The anime and manga magazine ''[[Neo (magazine)|Neo]]'' described Naruto's character as \"irksome\", but attributed the series' \"almost sickening addictiveness\" to its level of characterization.<ref name=\"neo023\">{{Cite news|last=White|first=Nik|date=September 2006|title=Naruto Vol. 1: Unleashed|magazine=[[Neo (magazine)|Neo]]|place=United Kingdom|publisher=Uncooked Media|issue=23|pages=70\u201371|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nThe visual appearances of the characters in the anime and manga have also received notice from reviewers. Carl Kimlinger of [[Anime News Network]] praised the characters' \"distinctive clothing, hair, faces and personalities\" that made them easily identifiable, as well as Kishimoto's \"clear eye for geography, movement and the human form\" and \"impeccable visual timing\".<ref name=\"ANNManga8-10Review\"/> Tucker, on the other hand, described Kishimoto as \"an average artist at best\" and derided the poor transition of his artistic style into animation.<ref name=\"THEMAnimeReviews\"/> Despite this, he admitted that when the animators were at their best, they produced \"artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga\", but ultimately concluded the animation was \"a mixed bag\".<ref name=\"THEMAnimeReviews2\"/>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=978-1-4215-1407-9}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=NARUTO\u2015\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8\u2015\u3000\u5916\u4f1d \uff5e\u4e03\u4ee3\u76ee\u706b\u5f71\u3068\u7dcb\u8272\u306e\u82b1\u3064\u6708\uff5e|trans-title=[[Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring]]|date=August 8, 2015|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|ISBN=978-1-4215-1407-9}}\n;''Naruto'' manga volumes by [[Masashi Kishimoto|Kishimoto, Masashi]].

He went on to complete his [[thesis]] as an [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] and [[NASA]] scholar at USC where he received his Ph.D. in Physics in 1971.\n\n==Career ==\nHon\u2019s career in physics truly started when he took up employment at [[Hughes Aircraft]] Company, [[Los Angeles]], one of the world\u2019s leading [[aerospace]] corporations. His work focused in particular on the research and development of tactical [[lasers]]. In his early years he became known for his work on high power laser frequency doubling, quickly reaching the level of Section Head and Senior Physicist. He became a coauthor in the internationally used ''Laser Handbook'' (North Holland Press, 1979).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Laser-Handbook-v-M-L-Stitch/dp/toc/0444852719 |title=''Laser Handbook v.3'' M.L.

With greater freedom in research choices, this facility is where he began to focus on the pursuit of lasers for [[nuclear fusion]]. By 1980 he had discovered and published a novel technique to efficiently compress high-power laser pulses (to attain over ten times the peak powers) by using SBS from a tapered [[optical fiber]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=''Optics Letters'' Pulse compression by stimulated Brillouin scattering, 5, 516-518, 1980 |journal=Optics Letters |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=516\u2013518 |doi=10.1364/OL.5.000516 |pmid=19701291 |publisher=Opticsinfobase.org |date=1980-12-01 |last1=Hon |first1=David T. }}</ref> This work has since inspired hundreds of related research projects right up to the present day.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uqun_jvJCR8C&pg=PA223&dq=d.t.+hon+laser#v=onepage&q=d.t.%20hon%20laser&f=false |title=''Phase Conjugate Laser Optics'', Brignon and Huignard, 2004 |accessdate=2012-04-01|isbn=9780471439578|year=2004|last1=Brignon |first1=Arnaud |last2=Huignard |first2=Jean-Pierre }}</ref> The technique is now widespread in laser nuclear fusion, and ground or space-born defense lasers, as well as in other areas of science and engineering where high, peak-power or high quality laser beams are desired.
