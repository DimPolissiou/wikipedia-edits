The club was founded on 3 November 1903, and is named after [[Isaac Newell]], from the English county of Kent, one of the pioneers of [[Football in Argentina|Argentine football]].\n\nA founding member of [[Liga Rosarina de Football]],<ref name=rosariorsssf>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arg-rosario12.html Argentina - Provincia de Santa Fe - Rosario] on RSSSF.com</ref> the club affiliated to the [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA) in 1939. Since then, Newell's Old Boys has taken part of tournaments organised by the body. The club has won six [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] championships plus three [[list of Argentine football national cups|National cups]] throughout their history. Newell's has also been twice [[Copa Libertadores]] runner-up (in [[1988 Copa Libertadores|1988]] and [[1992 Copa Libertadores|1992]]).\n\nThe club's football stadium is the [[Estadio Marcelo Bielsa]], named after the team's former player and [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Marcelo Bielsa]] (twice champion, and runner-up of one Copa Libertadores). Newell's plays the [[Rosario derby]] against [[Rosario Central]], a club with which they have a huge historical rivalry. \n\nNewell's is also notable for its youth divisions, being one of the clubs with most national titles in AFA's youth tournaments.<ref>[http://archivo.lacapital.com.ar/2005/05/26/ovacion/noticia_198426.shtml \"Newell's es el equipo r\u00e9cord en inferiores de AFA\"] in [[La Capital]].</ref> Players from the club's youths who have represented [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] are [[Gabriel Batistuta]], [[\u00c9ver Banega]], [[Walter Samuel]], [[Am\u00e9rico Gallego]], [[Jorge Valdano]], [[Gabriel Heinze]], [[Roberto Sensini]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] and [[Maxi Rodr\u00edguez]], among others. [[Lionel Messi]] also played in the club's youths, but left at a young age to [[Barcelona]] to seek treatment for his [[growth hormone deficiency]], while [[Diego Maradona]] played briefly for the first team in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.messi.com |title=Lionel Messi Website}}</ref>\n\nOther sports practised at this club are [[basketball]], [[boxing]], [[field hockey]], [[martial arts]], [[roller skating]] and [[volleyball]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Claudio Newell 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Claudio Newell, founding member of Newell's Old Boys.]]\nClub Atl\u00e9tico Newell's Old Boys was established on 3 November 1903. Claudio Newell was one of the founding members. Newell called teachers, pupils and alumni of the school to sign the act of foundation of the club. The name chosen paid tribute to Isaac Newell's life. The first president was V\u00edctor Heitz.\n\nThe name \"old boys\" is referred to graduates of a school. Therefore, \"Newell\u2019s Old Boys\" would mean \"Graduates of Newell's school\" or something similar. In fact, the players of the first football team were graduates of the school Isaac Newell had established, the ''Colegio Comercial Anglicano Argentino''.\n\nThe colours of the club were taken from the Colegio Comercial Anglicano Argentino emblem (designed by Isaac Newell himself) that were red and black inspired in the colours of the [[flag of England|English]] and [[flag of Germany|German]] flags respectively.\n\nNewell's Old Boys is often referred to as \"''leprosos''\" (\"lepers\"). The club got its nickname, the lepers, after playing in a charity match for a leprosy clinic in the 1920s.<ref>[http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/in-argentina-banfield-wins-first-title/ Bell, Jack. \"In Argentina, Banfield Wins First Title\"], ''Goal'' (''The New York Times'' football blog), Sunday, 13 December 2009</ref>\n\n===Liga Rosarina (1905\u20131930)===\n[[File:Newells 1905.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The team that played their first official match on 21 May 1905, v. [[Club Gimnasia y Esgrima de Rosario|Argentino]]]]\nOn 30 March 1905, the [[Liga Rosarina de Football]] (Rosarian Football League) was established, since a proposal of Newell's president Heitz, who invited representatives of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico del Rosario|Rosario Athletic]], [[Rosario Central]] and [[Club Gimnasia y Esgrima de Rosario|Atl\u00e9tico Argentino]] for that purpose. The main objective was to organise a championship, so a trophy was donated by the [[intendant]] of Rosario, Santiago Pinasco. The trophy was later named in his honour. Newell's was the winner of the first edition, having won eight games and finishing unbeaten. The team also scored 39 goals, conceding just 4.<ref>[https://www.infoleprosa.com.ar/2018/07/1905-newells-old-boys-primer-campeon.html Newell's Old Boys, primer campe\u00f3n]</ref>\n\nPreviously, the historic first Rosarino derby had been held. Newell's won 1\u20130 with a goal scored by Faustino Gonz\u00e1lez. The next year Newell's won its second championship.\n\nIn 1907, the Liga Rosarina established a second division. The Copa Santiago Pinasco tournament moved to that division and \"Copa Nicasio Vila\" (named in honour of then mayor of Rosario) was created to be played by the first division teams. Newell's won the first edition of this trophy, which they won a total 9 times between 1907 and 1930.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arg-rosario-champ.html Liga Rosarina de F\u00fatbol at RSSSF]</ref>\n\nThe [[Copa de Honor Municipalidad de Buenos Aires]] allowed teams from Buenos Aires and Rosario to take part in the competition. Newell's won the 1911 edition defeating [[Club Porte\u00f1o|Porte\u00f1o]] 3\u20132 at the final. Other trophy were teams of both cities played together was the [[Copa Ibarguren|Copa Dr. Carlos Ibarguren]], won by Newell's in 1921, defeating [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n|Hurac\u00e1n]] by 3\u20130.\n\n===The arrival to Primera Divisi\u00f3n===\n[[File:Newell's 1939.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The team that debuted in Primera Divisi\u00f3n in 1939]]\nIn 1939, Newell's asked [[Argentine Football Association]] to play the [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] championship. The AFA accepted the request so Newell's played its first tournament in [[1939 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1939]], along with Rosario Central which was also added to the competition. Despite playing in the national tournaments, Newell's continued participating in the regional leagues of Rosario, but with youth amateur players. Newell's debuted in the AFA tournaments on 19 March 1939, defeating [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] by 2\u20131. The line-up was: Heredia; Gilli, Soneyro; Sisniega, Perucca, Reynoso; Bel\u00e9n, Fabrini, G\u00f3mez, Franco, S\u00e1nchez.\n\n===National titles===\n[[File:Newells 1988.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Newell's O.B. team that won the 1987-88 Primera Divisi\u00f3n championship]]\nNewell's Old Boys have won the Primera Divisi\u00f3n championship six times ([[1974 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1974 Metropolitano]], [[1987-88 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1987\u201388]], [[1990-91 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1990\u201391]], [[1991-92 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1992 Clausura]], [[2004-05 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Apertura 2004]] and [[2012-13 Argentine Primera Division|2013 Final]]) and were the runners-up of the [[Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica]] twice (1988 and 1992). The 1990\u201391 championship was contested between the 1990 Apertura (Newell's) and 1991 Clausura ([[Boca Juniors]]) champions, which Newell's won in home-and-away matches. Even though the 1990 Apertura was not considered official by itself, it is considered by Newell's supporters to be their \"seventh\" championship.\n\nNewell's also won a friendly youth mini-tournament called the Little World Cup in 1988, against [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]], [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and is, together with [[Boca Juniors]], [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] and [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] one of the few Argentine clubs that made a long and successful tour in Europe (in 1949), in which they defeated several important teams such as [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and the Spanish National \"A\" Team. These are the only major international achievements of the club until now (although several minor international summer tournaments were won, with the 1943 Copa de Oro Rioplatense standing up). So far the club has not won an official international championship.\n\nNewell's Old Boys is one of a very few teams to have had all their players represent the national team in a single game, when they represented Argentina in a Pre-Olympic Tournament with their undefeated reserve team. It finished third in America, after Brazil and Uruguay.\n\nThe team has also contributed a great number of players to the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]], and exported many players to Europe's top leagues, mostly to Italy and Spain. Among its great players were [[Gabriel Batistuta]], [[Abel Balbo]], [[Jorge Valdano]], [[Am\u00e9rico Gallego]], [[Mario Zanabria]], [[Gustavo Dezotti]], [[Roberto Sensini]], [[Walter Samuel]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]], [[Ren\u00e9 Pontoni]], [[Gerardo Martino]], \u00c1ngel Perucca and several more. It has recently produced [[Argentina national football team|Argentine internationals]] [[Gabriel Heinze]], [[Maxi Rodr\u00edguez]] and [[Lionel Messi]].\n\nThe club's president is Eduardo Berm\u00fadez who was elected during 2016.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main|Estadio Marcelo Bielsa}}\n\n[[File:El Coloso del Parque 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|El Coloso del Parque]]\nThe Newell's Old Boys stadium has been in the Parque Independencia neighborhood of [[Rosario]] since 1911, and is commonly called ''El Coloso del Parque'' (the Colossus of the Independence Park). The capacity was increased from 31,000 to 42,000 in 1997. On 22 December 2009 the stadium was renamed after [[Marcelo Bielsa]], in honour of the former player and coach of the team.<ref>http://www.latercera.com/contenido/688_195166_9.shtml</ref>\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\n{{Updated|22 March 2020}}<ref name=\"Soccerway\">{{cite news|title=Newell's Old Boys squad|url=https://int.soccerway.com/teams/argentina/newell-s-old-boys/102/squad/|accessdate=7 October 2018|work=Soccerway}}</ref>\n\n{{Fs start}}<!--start of 1st column for table-->\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=ARG|pos=GK|name=[[Alan Aguerre]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat=ARG|pos=DF|name=[[Cristian Lema]]|other=on loan from [[S.L.

Since then, Newell's Old Boys has taken part of tournaments organised by the body. The club has won six [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] championships plus three [[list of Argentine football national cups|National cups]] throughout their history. Newell's has also been twice [[Copa Libertadores]] runner-up (in [[1988 Copa Libertadores|1988]] and [[1992 Copa Libertadores|1992]]).\n\nThe club's football stadium is the [[Estadio Marcelo Bielsa]], named after the team's former player and [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Marcelo Bielsa]] (twice champion, and runner-up of one Copa Libertadores). Newell's plays the [[Rosario derby]] against [[Rosario Central]], a club with which they have a huge historical rivalry. \n\nNewell's is also notable for its youth divisions, being one of the clubs with most national titles in AFA's youth tournaments.<ref>[http://archivo.lacapital.com.ar/2005/05/26/ovacion/noticia_198426.shtml \"Newell's es el equipo r\u00e9cord en inferiores de AFA\"] in [[La Capital]].</ref> Players from the club's youths who have represented [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] are [[Gabriel Batistuta]], [[\u00c9ver Banega]], [[Walter Samuel]], [[Am\u00e9rico Gallego]], [[Jorge Valdano]], [[Gabriel Heinze]], [[Roberto Sensini]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] and [[Maxi Rodr\u00edguez]], among others. [[Lionel Messi]] also played in the club's youths, but left at a young age to [[Barcelona]] to seek treatment for his [[growth hormone deficiency]], while [[Diego Maradona]] played briefly for the first team in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.messi.com |title=Lionel Messi Website}}</ref>\n\nOther sports practised at this club are [[basketball]], [[boxing]], [[field hockey]], [[martial arts]], [[roller skating]] and [[volleyball]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Claudio Newell 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Claudio Newell, founding member of Newell's Old Boys.]]\nClub Atl\u00e9tico Newell's Old Boys was established on 3 November 1903. Claudio Newell was one of the founding members. Newell called teachers, pupils and alumni of the school to sign the act of foundation of the club. The name chosen paid tribute to Isaac Newell's life. The first president was V\u00edctor Heitz.\n\nThe name \"old boys\" is referred to graduates of a school. Therefore, \"Newell\u2019s Old Boys\" would mean \"Graduates of Newell's school\" or something similar. In fact, the players of the first football team were graduates of the school Isaac Newell had established, the ''Colegio Comercial Anglicano Argentino''.\n\nThe colours of the club were taken from the Colegio Comercial Anglicano Argentino emblem (designed by Isaac Newell himself) that were red and black inspired in the colours of the [[flag of England|English]] and [[flag of Germany|German]] flags respectively.\n\nNewell's Old Boys is often referred to as \"''leprosos''\" (\"lepers\"). The club got its nickname, the lepers, after playing in a charity match for a leprosy clinic in the 1920s.<ref>[http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/in-argentina-banfield-wins-first-title/ Bell, Jack. \"In Argentina, Banfield Wins First Title\"], ''Goal'' (''The New York Times'' football blog), Sunday, 13 December 2009</ref>\n\n===Liga Rosarina (1905\u20131930)===\n[[File:Newells 1905.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The team that played their first official match on 21 May 1905, v. [[Club Gimnasia y Esgrima de Rosario|Argentino]]]]\nOn 30 March 1905, the [[Liga Rosarina de Football]] (Rosarian Football League) was established, since a proposal of Newell's president Heitz, who invited representatives of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico del Rosario|Rosario Athletic]], [[Rosario Central]] and [[Club Gimnasia y Esgrima de Rosario|Atl\u00e9tico Argentino]] for that purpose. The main objective was to organise a championship, so a trophy was donated by the [[intendant]] of Rosario, Santiago Pinasco. The trophy was later named in his honour. Newell's was the winner of the first edition, having won eight games and finishing unbeaten. The team also scored 39 goals, conceding just 4.<ref>[https://www.infoleprosa.com.ar/2018/07/1905-newells-old-boys-primer-campeon.html Newell's Old Boys, primer campe\u00f3n]</ref>\n\nPreviously, the historic first Rosarino derby had been held. Newell's won 1\u20130 with a goal scored by Faustino Gonz\u00e1lez. The next year Newell's won its second championship.\n\nIn 1907, the Liga Rosarina established a second division. The Copa Santiago Pinasco tournament moved to that division and \"Copa Nicasio Vila\" (named in honour of then mayor of Rosario) was created to be played by the first division teams. Newell's won the first edition of this trophy, which they won a total 9 times between 1907 and 1930.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arg-rosario-champ.html Liga Rosarina de F\u00fatbol at RSSSF]</ref>\n\nThe [[Copa de Honor Municipalidad de Buenos Aires]] allowed teams from Buenos Aires and Rosario to take part in the competition. Newell's won the 1911 edition defeating [[Club Porte\u00f1o|Porte\u00f1o]] 3\u20132 at the final. Other trophy were teams of both cities played together was the [[Copa Ibarguren|Copa Dr. Carlos Ibarguren]], won by Newell's in 1921, defeating [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n|Hurac\u00e1n]] by 3\u20130.\n\n===The arrival to Primera Divisi\u00f3n===\n[[File:Newell's 1939.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The team that debuted in Primera Divisi\u00f3n in 1939]]\nIn 1939, Newell's asked [[Argentine Football Association]] to play the [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] championship. The AFA accepted the request so Newell's played its first tournament in [[1939 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1939]], along with Rosario Central which was also added to the competition. Despite playing in the national tournaments, Newell's continued participating in the regional leagues of Rosario, but with youth amateur players. Newell's debuted in the AFA tournaments on 19 March 1939, defeating [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] by 2\u20131. The line-up was: Heredia; Gilli, Soneyro; Sisniega, Perucca, Reynoso; Bel\u00e9n, Fabrini, G\u00f3mez, Franco, S\u00e1nchez.\n\n===National titles===\n[[File:Newells 1988.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Newell's O.B. team that won the 1987-88 Primera Divisi\u00f3n championship]]\nNewell's Old Boys have won the Primera Divisi\u00f3n championship six times ([[1974 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1974 Metropolitano]], [[1987-88 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1987\u201388]], [[1990-91 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1990\u201391]], [[1991-92 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1992 Clausura]], [[2004-05 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Apertura 2004]] and [[2012-13 Argentine Primera Division|2013 Final]]) and were the runners-up of the [[Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica]] twice (1988 and 1992). The 1990\u201391 championship was contested between the 1990 Apertura (Newell's) and 1991 Clausura ([[Boca Juniors]]) champions, which Newell's won in home-and-away matches. Even though the 1990 Apertura was not considered official by itself, it is considered by Newell's supporters to be their \"seventh\" championship.\n\nNewell's also won a friendly youth mini-tournament called the Little World Cup in 1988, against [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]], [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and is, together with [[Boca Juniors]], [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] and [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] one of the few Argentine clubs that made a long and successful tour in Europe (in 1949), in which they defeated several important teams such as [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and the Spanish National \"A\" Team. These are the only major international achievements of the club until now (although several minor international summer tournaments were won, with the 1943 Copa de Oro Rioplatense standing up). So far the club has not won an official international championship.\n\nNewell's Old Boys is one of a very few teams to have had all their players represent the national team in a single game, when they represented Argentina in a Pre-Olympic Tournament with their undefeated reserve team. It finished third in America, after Brazil and Uruguay.\n\nThe team has also contributed a great number of players to the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]], and exported many players to Europe's top leagues, mostly to Italy and Spain. Among its great players were [[Gabriel Batistuta]], [[Abel Balbo]], [[Jorge Valdano]], [[Am\u00e9rico Gallego]], [[Mario Zanabria]], [[Gustavo Dezotti]], [[Roberto Sensini]], [[Walter Samuel]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]], [[Ren\u00e9 Pontoni]], [[Gerardo Martino]], \u00c1ngel Perucca and several more. It has recently produced [[Argentina national football team|Argentine internationals]] [[Gabriel Heinze]], [[Maxi Rodr\u00edguez]] and [[Lionel Messi]].\n\nThe club's president is Eduardo Berm\u00fadez who was elected during 2016.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main|Estadio Marcelo Bielsa}}\n\n[[File:El Coloso del Parque 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|El Coloso del Parque]]\nThe Newell's Old Boys stadium has been in the Parque Independencia neighborhood of [[Rosario]] since 1911, and is commonly called ''El Coloso del Parque'' (the Colossus of the Independence Park). The capacity was increased from 31,000 to 42,000 in 1997. On 22 December 2009 the stadium was renamed after [[Marcelo Bielsa]], in honour of the former player and coach of the team.<ref>http://www.latercera.com/contenido/688_195166_9.shtml</ref>\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\n{{Updated|22 March 2020}}<ref name=\"Soccerway\">{{cite news|title=Newell's Old Boys squad|url=https://int.soccerway.com/teams/argentina/newell-s-old-boys/102/squad/|accessdate=7 October 2018|work=Soccerway}}</ref>\n\n{{Fs start}}<!--start of 1st column for table-->\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=ARG|pos=GK|name=[[Alan Aguerre]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat=ARG|pos=DF|name=[[Cristian Lema]]|other=on loan from [[S.L.

The [[Plantation house in the Southern United States|plantation house]] is a [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]]- and [[Italianate architecture|Italianate-styled]] [[mansion]] built by John Hampden Randolph in 1859, and is the largest extant [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] plantation house in the South with {{convert|53000|sqft|m2}} of floor space.\n\n==Mansion and grounds==\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation House.jpg|thumb|left|250px|North Front of Nottoway]]\nJohn Randolph commissioned renowned architect [[Henry Howard (architect)|Henry Howard]] of [[New Orleans]] with the task of designing the grand mansion with the intention that no expense would be spared in the construction. Howard sited the three-story wooden frame house, that includes a one-story rusticated stucco-covered brick base on a concrete foundation, to face east towards the [[Mississippi River]]. The entrance facade is asymmetrically balanced with a projecting bedroom wing to the left side and a large curved bay with galleries on the right. The main five-bay structure, with a central projecting portico, emphasizes height rather than width with the main living areas on the second and third-stories both being {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} in height above the one-story basement, scored to appear as stone, and featuring an arched niche flanked with narrow [[Fenestration (architecture)|fenestrations]]. The galleries are embellished with custom ornamental iron railings made in New Orleans, capped with molded wooden handrails. Double curved [[granite]] staircases, installed by skilled mason, Newton Richards, rise to the second-story. These steps were built with the left side intended for ladies and the right side for gentlemen. The steps for the men can also be identified by the boot scraper at the bottom. The separate staircases were so that the men would not see the women's ankles beneath their skirts as they climbed, which was considered a severe breach of social [[etiquette]] at the time. The close spacing and angularity of the gallery's 22 square columns and their elongated capitals also emphasize the vertical qualities of the house. Above the capitals, small brackets branch out to carry a tall [[entablature]] decorated with [[modillions]], supporting a projecting [[cornice]] that nearly covers the hipped roof that is pierced with six chimneys. In the rear of the house is a two-story [[studio apartment|gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re]] wing where the Randolph sons resided.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway Plantation|url=http://www.knowla.org/entry/1727/|publisher=Knowla.org|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of Nottoway was completed in 1859 at an estimated cost of $80,000; to prevent any duplicate homes being built, Randolph destroyed the architect's plans after completion.\n\n===Interiors===\n[[File:Nottoway Interior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The White Ballroom]][[File:Nottoway Dining Room.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Dining Room]]\nNottoway has over an acre of floor space spread out over three floors, and a total of 64 rooms with 165 doors and 200 windows, most of which can also double as doors.  The house enjoyed 19th-century novelties such as a bathroom located on each floor with flushing toilets and hot and cold running water, gas lighting throughout the house and a complex servant call bell system. The principal rooms of the house are located on the second floor. The entrance hall runs the length of the house and is 12 feet wide and 40 feet long. Large [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] and brass chandeliers hang from the {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} high ceilings and the doors with hand-painted German Dresden porcelain doorknobs and matching keyhole covers, leading to the adjacent rooms are {{convert|11|ft|m}} tall. Above the doors and along the ceilings are plaster frieze moldings, with modillions interspersed with [[paterae]], that are made from mud, clay, horse hair and Spanish moss. To the right of the entrance hall is the most unusual, and reportedly John Randolph's most favorite room in the house, the White Ballroom. With [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns, hand-cast archways and an L-shaped extension into a curved bay, Randolph had it painted completely white, including the flooring, to show off the natural beauty of his seven daughters, six of whom would be married there. Featuring two fireplaces with hand-carved [[rococo]] white marble mantles, there is also an original mirror placed so that the women could see if their ankles or [[Hoop skirt|hoops]] were showing beneath their skirts. Over one of the fireplaces, there is a painting of Mary Henshaw (no relation to the family), whose eyes are said to follow the viewer around the room. Flanking the entrance hall to the left is a gentleman's study, a stair hall and the formal dining room. Both the study and the dining room feature black Italian hand-carved marble mantles on their coal burning fireplaces, and the rooms are filled with period antique furniture. The dining room plasterwork showcases pink camellias, Emily Randolph's favorite flower, and is the only plasterwork in the house to have color.\n\nThe main staircase of Honduran mahogany is covered in green velvet and ascends to the Ancestral Hall on the third-floor. The hall was used by the Randolphs as a family parlor, being a central thoroughfare to many of the adjacent bedrooms, and gave access to the third-floor gallery with views of the Mississippi River. Nearby, is the master bedroom, with one of the three original bathrooms, as well as a small room that was used as a [[Nursery (room)|nursery]] for Julia Marceline, the Randolph's last and only child born at Nottoway. During the Civil War, Emily Randolph utilized a bedpost at the end of the bed to hide valuable jewelry. Though originally bedrooms, one has been made into a music room displaying musical instruments from the 19th-century, and another known as the Wicker Room features wicker furniture originally owned by the Randolph family.\n\nThe first floor basement has been transformed into a restaurant and a small museum about the Randolph family, and the history of the plantation. Originally the space held the laundry, dairy, wine cellar and servants quarters, as well as a 10-pin bowling alley for the amusement of the children.\n\n===Grounds===\nThe landscape for Nottoway was designed by John Nelson of New Orleans whose plan included 120 fruit and citrus trees, 12 magnolia trees, poplar and live oak trees, 75 rose bushes, 150 strawberry plants and a variety of flower and vegetable gardens. However, due to neglect and the erosion of six and a half acres of land by the Mississippi River, the gardens designed by Nelson no longer exist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway's Architectural History|url=https://nottowayplantation.wordpress.com/|publisher=Nottoway Plantation's Blog|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}</ref> Today, the house sits only 200 feet behind a river levee and the grounds include a small formal hedge garden adjacent to the gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re where the detached kitchen once stood, and a fountain courtyard in front of the southern bedroom wing. Surrounding the house are modern ancillary buildings that house offices and event facilities. The owners expanded the property in 2008 by building a carriage house, ballroom and nine Acadian-style cottages modeled after the property's original slave quarters, while the plantation was closed to the public for repairs, as a result of damage incurred by [[Hurricane Gustav]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Louisiana plantation to be auctioned|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/02/historic-louisiana-plantation-to-be-auctioned/|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> To the north of the house is the reconstructed stables, now re-purposed as a ballroom, and the Randolph cemetery where the remains of the family were reinterred in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\nJohn Hampden Randolph was born in [[Virginia]] in 1813, a member of the prominent [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolph family]]. He migrated with his family to Mississippi when his father, [[Peter Randolph|Peter Randolph Jr.]], was appointed a federal judge in [[Woodville, Mississippi]], by [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] in 1820.\n\nJohn Randolph married Emily Jane Liddell in 1837 and went on to have eleven children with her. Randolph devoted most of his time to his [[cotton]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], but believing sugar production would be more lucrative he decided to move his family to southern Louisiana in 1842 where he purchased a {{convert|1650|acre|km2}} cotton plantation that he named Forest Home. Converting the plantation to [[sugar cane]] production two years later and constructing [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville Parish's]] first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] [[sugar cane mill|sugar mill]], he was able to triple his earnings over his cotton production. Within ten years he had increased his holdings to {{convert|7116|acre|km2}} and owned 176 [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved people]] making Randolph one of the larger slaveholders in the South. In 1855 he purchased an additional {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of highland, and {{convert|620|acre|km2}} of [[swamp]] and Mississippi River-front land where he sought to build a more prestigious home that he named \"Nottoway\", after [[Nottoway County, Virginia|Nottoway County]] in the part of Virginia where he was born.\n\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation-022.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Painting by Cornelia Randolph showing original garden landscape]]\nHe selected Henry Howard, a very popular architect of the time, considered to have been one of the finest architects of 19th-century [[New Orleans]]. Many of his Greek Revival and Italianate style buildings, churches, and homes can still be found in the city.  He also designed the neighboring [[Belle Grove Plantation (Iberville Parish, Louisiana)|Belle Grove]], now destroyed.  Randolph and the owner of Belle Grove, John Andrews, are known to have had a rivalry of sorts that even extended to their homes.<ref name=\"lostplan\">{{cite book |title=Lost Plantations of the South |last=Matrana |first=Marc R. |year=2009 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, MS |isbn=978-1-57806-942-2 |pages=184\u2013192 }}</ref> Compiling the materials for his [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation home]], cypress logs were cut and cured under water for six years, then cut into planks and dried into what is called virgin cypress. The wood's most notable feature is not its durability, but its resistance to termites. Handmade bricks were baked in kilns by enslaved workers and 40 carpenters, brick masons and plumbers were hired by Howard, who lived in tents at the site of construction while doing their work. The massive home was completed in 1859 along with a variety of other buildings including quarters for enslaved workers, a schoolhouse, greenhouse, stable, steam-powered sugar house, wood cisterns, and other necessary buildings for an agricultural operation.<ref name=\"Nottoway\">{{cite book |title=Nottoway Plantation: The South's Largest Antebellum Mansion |last=Sommers Castaldi |first=Robin |year=2013 |publisher=Nottoway Properties, Inc |isbn=978-0-9891285-0-6 |pages=26\u201369 }}</ref>\n\nSoon after the house was completed the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began. Randolph did not support secession from the Union, but once the war began, backed the war financially and sent his three sons to fight for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], losing his oldest son, Algernon Sidney Randolph, at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]]. With the war coming ever closer to Nottoway, it was decided that Randolph would take 200 enslaved people to [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]], and grow cotton there while his wife, Emily, stayed at Nottoway with the youngest children, hoping that their presence would save it from destruction. The plantation was occupied by both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and Confederate troops and though the grounds were damaged and the animals taken, Nottoway survived the war with only a single [[grapeshot]] to the far left column that did not fall out until 1971.\n\nWith the [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation]] of the slaves, John Randolph contracted with 53 of his former bond people to continue working as laborers. When he returned to Nottoway after the Civil War, most, having few other choices, returned with him. The sugar business was not as profitable after the war and by 1875, Nottoway was reduced to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}. John Randolph died at Nottoway on September 8, 1883, leaving the plantation to his wife.\n\nEmily Randolph sold the plantation in 1889 for [[$]]50,000, which she divided equally among her nine surviving children and herself. She died in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in 1904.<ref>Fisher, C. (1996). ''The Nottoway Plantation, Restaurant, and Inn: The White Castle of Louisiana''. North American Case Research Association (NACRA), 16(3).</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe new owners of Nottoway were D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Pierre Landry and his father-in-law, Jean Baptiste Dugas, whose family owned the plantation until 1909, when Landry's widow sold Nottoway to sugar [[Planter (American South)|planter]] Alfonse Hanlon. Soon after, Hanlon lost Nottoway to foreclosure in 1913 due to crop failures the previous two years that resulted in tax problems and accrued medical bills by his wife's failing health. Dr. Whyte G. Owen purchased the plantation out of foreclosure in the amount of $10,000.\n\nDr. Owen, one-time Surgeon General of Louisiana, attempted to run the estate as a sugar plantation, but was not successful.  He sold off {{convert|1193|acre|ha}}, keeping the house and surrounding property. After his death in 1949, Nottoway was inherited by his son Stanford who lived with his wife Odessa in the house until his death in 1974. Thereafter, Odessa Owen lived alone in the massive house, trying to maintain it with her limited resources. Knowing she was unable to adequately care for the house, Owen sold the plantation to Arlin K. Dease in 1980, who had restored three other antebellum mansions, including the [[Myrtles Plantation]] in [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]] with the caveat that she be allowed to live in house until her death. Dying in 2003, it was at this time the house ceased to be a private home. Dease restored Nottoway, working a crew of 40 to 60 men 12 hours a day, and opened the house to the public three months after his purchase. Arlin Dease sold Nottoway to [[Paul Ramsay]] of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 1985, after he had stayed at the property while in the area for business.<ref name=Nottoway/>\n\n===21st century===\nUnder Ramsay's tenure, Nottoway has become a resort destination.

Surrounding the house are modern ancillary buildings that house offices and event facilities. The owners expanded the property in 2008 by building a carriage house, ballroom and nine Acadian-style cottages modeled after the property's original slave quarters, while the plantation was closed to the public for repairs, as a result of damage incurred by [[Hurricane Gustav]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Louisiana plantation to be auctioned|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/02/historic-louisiana-plantation-to-be-auctioned/|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> To the north of the house is the reconstructed stables, now re-purposed as a ballroom, and the Randolph cemetery where the remains of the family were reinterred in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\nJohn Hampden Randolph was born in [[Virginia]] in 1813, a member of the prominent [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolph family]]. He migrated with his family to Mississippi when his father, [[Peter Randolph|Peter Randolph Jr.]], was appointed a federal judge in [[Woodville, Mississippi]], by [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] in 1820.\n\nJohn Randolph married Emily Jane Liddell in 1837 and went on to have eleven children with her. Randolph devoted most of his time to his [[cotton]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], but believing sugar production would be more lucrative he decided to move his family to southern Louisiana in 1842 where he purchased a {{convert|1650|acre|km2}} cotton plantation that he named Forest Home. Converting the plantation to [[sugar cane]] production two years later and constructing [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville Parish's]] first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] [[sugar cane mill|sugar mill]], he was able to triple his earnings over his cotton production. Within ten years he had increased his holdings to {{convert|7116|acre|km2}} and owned 176 [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved people]] making Randolph one of the larger slaveholders in the South. In 1855 he purchased an additional {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of highland, and {{convert|620|acre|km2}} of [[swamp]] and Mississippi River-front land where he sought to build a more prestigious home that he named \"Nottoway\", after [[Nottoway County, Virginia|Nottoway County]] in the part of Virginia where he was born.\n\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation-022.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Painting by Cornelia Randolph showing original garden landscape]]\nHe selected Henry Howard, a very popular architect of the time, considered to have been one of the finest architects of 19th-century [[New Orleans]]. Many of his Greek Revival and Italianate style buildings, churches, and homes can still be found in the city.  He also designed the neighboring [[Belle Grove Plantation (Iberville Parish, Louisiana)|Belle Grove]], now destroyed.  Randolph and the owner of Belle Grove, John Andrews, are known to have had a rivalry of sorts that even extended to their homes.<ref name=\"lostplan\">{{cite book |title=Lost Plantations of the South |last=Matrana |first=Marc R. |year=2009 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, MS |isbn=978-1-57806-942-2 |pages=184\u2013192 }}</ref> Compiling the materials for his [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation home]], cypress logs were cut and cured under water for six years, then cut into planks and dried into what is called virgin cypress. The wood's most notable feature is not its durability, but its resistance to termites. Handmade bricks were baked in kilns by enslaved workers and 40 carpenters, brick masons and plumbers were hired by Howard, who lived in tents at the site of construction while doing their work. The massive home was completed in 1859 along with a variety of other buildings including quarters for enslaved workers, a schoolhouse, greenhouse, stable, steam-powered sugar house, wood cisterns, and other necessary buildings for an agricultural operation.<ref name=\"Nottoway\">{{cite book |title=Nottoway Plantation: The South's Largest Antebellum Mansion |last=Sommers Castaldi |first=Robin |year=2013 |publisher=Nottoway Properties, Inc |isbn=978-0-9891285-0-6 |pages=26\u201369 }}</ref>\n\nSoon after the house was completed the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began. Randolph did not support secession from the Union, but once the war began, backed the war financially and sent his three sons to fight for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], losing his oldest son, Algernon Sidney Randolph, at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]]. With the war coming ever closer to Nottoway, it was decided that Randolph would take 200 enslaved people to [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]], and grow cotton there while his wife, Emily, stayed at Nottoway with the youngest children, hoping that their presence would save it from destruction. The plantation was occupied by both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and Confederate troops and though the grounds were damaged and the animals taken, Nottoway survived the war with only a single [[grapeshot]] to the far left column that did not fall out until 1971.\n\nWith the [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation]] of the slaves, John Randolph contracted with 53 of his former bond people to continue working as laborers. When he returned to Nottoway after the Civil War, most, having few other choices, returned with him. The sugar business was not as profitable after the war and by 1875, Nottoway was reduced to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}. John Randolph died at Nottoway on September 8, 1883, leaving the plantation to his wife.\n\nEmily Randolph sold the plantation in 1889 for [[$]]50,000, which she divided equally among her nine surviving children and herself. She died in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in 1904.<ref>Fisher, C. (1996). ''The Nottoway Plantation, Restaurant, and Inn: The White Castle of Louisiana''.

Soon after, Hanlon lost Nottoway to foreclosure in 1913 due to crop failures the previous two years that resulted in tax problems and accrued medical bills by his wife's failing health. Dr. Whyte G. Owen purchased the plantation out of foreclosure in the amount of $10,000.\n\nDr. Owen, one-time Surgeon General of Louisiana, attempted to run the estate as a sugar plantation, but was not successful.  He sold off {{convert|1193|acre|ha}}, keeping the house and surrounding property. After his death in 1949, Nottoway was inherited by his son Stanford who lived with his wife Odessa in the house until his death in 1974. Thereafter, Odessa Owen lived alone in the massive house trying to maintain the house with her limited resources. Knowing she was unable to adequately care for the house, Owen sold the plantation to Arlin K. Dease in 1980, who had restored three other antebellum mansions, including the [[Myrtles Plantation]] in [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]] with the caveat that she be allowed to live in house until her death. Dying in 2003, it was at this time the house ceased to be a private home. Dease restored Nottoway, working a crew of 40 to 60 men 12 hours a day, and opened the house to the public three months after his purchase. Arlin Dease sold Nottoway to [[Paul Ramsay]] of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 1985, after he had stayed at the property while in the area for business.<ref name=Nottoway/>\n\n===21st century===\nUnder Ramsay's tenure, Nottoway has become a resort destination.

Refusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers, Descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him. In the opening section of the ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'', an [[Early modern period|early modern]] treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic \"as if no one had written on these matters before\". His best known philosophical statement is \"[[Cogito, ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]\" ({{lang-fr|link=no|Je pense, donc je suis}}; {{lang-la|link=no| cogito, ergo sum}}), found in ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' (1637; written in French and Latin) and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644; written in Latin).<ref>This idea had already been proposed by the Spanish philosopher [[G\u00f3mez Pereira]] a hundred years ago in the form: \"I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist\" (''nosco me aliquid noscere, & quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum'').

Thought cannot be separated from me, therefore, I exist (''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Principles of Philosophy''). Most notably, this is known as ''cogito ergo sum'' (English: \"I think, therefore I am\"). Therefore, Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting; therefore, the very fact that he doubted proved his existence.  \"The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten books: Chosen by Raj Persuade|publisher=The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]]|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/181/3/258}}</ref> These two first principles\u2014I think and I exist\u2014were later confirmed by Descartes' clear and distinct perception (delineated in his [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation III: Concerning God.2C That He Exists|Third Meditation]]): that I clearly and distinctly perceive these two principles, Descartes reasoned, ensures their indubitability.\n\nDescartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form? He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however, these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a ''thinking thing''. Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines \"thought\" (''cogitatio'') as \"what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it\". Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately [[Consciousness|conscious]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Ren\u00e9 |last=Descartes |year=1644 |title=The Principles of Philosophy (IX)}}</ref> He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from [[dream argument|dreams]], and that one's mind cannot have been \"hijacked\" by an [[evil demon]] placing an illusory external world before one's senses.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{quote|And so something that I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind.<ref>Bardt, C., ''Material and Mind'' (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2019), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yk2rDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA109 p. 109].</ref>{{rp|109}}}}\n\nIn this manner, Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge, discarding [[perception]] as unreliable and, instead, admitting only [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] as a method.<ref name=\"Preface\"/>\n\n===Dualism===\n{{Further|Mind-body problem|Mind-body dualism}}\n[[File:L'homme V00083 00000004.tif|thumb|''L'homme'' (1664)]]\n\nDescartes, influenced by the [[automaton]]s on display throughout the city of Paris, began to investigate the connection between the mind and body, and how the two interact.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.whitman.edu/~herbrawt/classes/339/Descartes.pdf |title='A Brute to the Brutes?': Descartes' Treatment of Animals |last=Cottingham |first=John |author-link=John Cottingham |access-date=24 February 2018 |work=Whitman People }}</ref> His main influences for [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] were [[theology]] and [[physics]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor=20013943|title=What Moves the Mind: An Excursion in Cartesian Dualism |last=Watson |first=Richard A. |author-link=Richard Watson (philosopher) |date=January 1982 |journal=[[American Philosophical Quarterly]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=73\u201381 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}</ref> The theory on the dualism of mind and body is Descartes' signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced.

While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp, he thought it was entirely straightforward. Descartes employed the concept of ''modes'', which are the ways in which substances exist. In ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'', Descartes explained, \"we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot, conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance\". To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction,<ref name=\"David Cunning 2014 278\">{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=278}}</ref> which Descartes explained as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention.

Everything that happened, be it the motion of the [[star]]s or the growth of a [[tree]], was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose, goal or end that worked its way out within nature. Aristotle called this the \"final cause,\" and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated. Descartes' theory of dualism supports the distinction between traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and Galileo, which denied the role of a divine power and \"final causes\" in its attempts to explain nature. Descartes' dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter by expelling the final cause from the physical universe (or ''res extensa'') in favor of the mind (or ''res cogitans''). Therefore, while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern [[physics]], it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the [[soul]].<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=87}}</ref>\n\nDescartes' dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings. A human was according to Descartes a composite entity of mind and body. Descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body, but the body could not exist without the mind. In ''Meditations'' Descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance, the body is composed only of \"accidents\".<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=301}}</ref> But he did argue that mind and body are closely joined:<ref name=\"Georges Dicker 2013 303\">{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=303}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Nature also teaches me, by the sensations of pain, hunger, thirst and so on, that I am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship, but that I am very closely joined and, as it were, intermingled with it, so that I and the body form a unit.

It was this theory of innate knowledge that later led philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632\u20131704) to combat the theory of [[empiricism]], which held that all knowledge is acquired through experience.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor=27532614 |title=John Locke's Contributions to Education |last=Baldwin |first=Bird T. |date=April 1913 |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |journal=[[The Sewanee Review]] |access-date=|volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=177\u2013187}}</ref>\n\n===Physiology and psychology===\nIn ''The Passions of the Soul'', written between 1645 and 1646, Descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits. These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles, and served as a metaphor for feelings, like being in high or bad spirit. These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul, or passions of the soul. Descartes distinguished six basic passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness. All of these passions, he argued, represented different combinations of the original spirit, and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions. He argued, for example, that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body. In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body, he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the [[pineal gland]] as connector.<ref>{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=86}}</ref> Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland, through animal spirits. Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits. He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on God's will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them. But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland, thus humans had to learn how to control their passions.<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 87\">{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=87}}</ref>\n\nDescartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events which influenced 19th-century [[reflex]] theory. He argued that external motions such as touch and sound reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits. Heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions, with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system, and in turn animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire.<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 87\"/> Through this chain of reactions the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process.<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 88\"/>\n\nAbove all he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was [[Divinity|divine]], thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous. Descartes' writings went on to form the basis for theories on [[emotion]]s and how [[Cognition|cognitive]] evaluations were translated into affective processes. Descartes believed that the brain resembled a working machine and unlike many of his contemporaries believed that mathematics and mechanics could explain the most complicated processes of the mind. In the 20th century [[Alan Turing]] advanced [[computer science]] based on [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]] as inspired by Descartes. His theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced [[Physiology|physiological theories]] more than 200 years after his death. The physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]] was a great admirer of Descartes.<ref>{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=88}}</ref>\n\n===Moral philosophy===\nFor Descartes, [[ethics]] was a science, the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics.<ref name=\"Preface\"/> In this way, he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind-body dualism, and defends [[free will]]. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that we should seek, and [[virtue]] consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge, because a well-informed mind will be more capable of making good [[choices]], and it also depends on mental condition. For this reason, he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body. He discussed this subject in the correspondence with [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], and as a result wrote his work ''The Passions of the Soul'', that contains a study of the [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions.<ref name=\"Blom\">Blom, John J., Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology.

For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that, in fact, this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that this good contributes to happiness but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.<ref name=\"Blom\"/> The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his ''Discourse on the Method'' he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. This is known as his [[Discourse on the Method#Part III: Morals, and Maxims accepted while conducting Method|\"Provisional Morals\"]].\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Descartes3.jpg|thumb|Ren\u00e9 Descartes at work]]\nIn the third and fifth ''Meditation'', Descartes offers an [[Ontological argument|ontological proof]] of a benevolent God (through both the ontological argument and [[trademark argument]]). Because God is benevolent, Descartes can have some faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, for God has provided him with a working mind and [[Sensory nervous system|sensory system]] and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, Descartes finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction ''and'' perception. Regarding [[epistemology]], therefore, Descartes can be said to have contributed such ideas as a rigorous conception of [[foundationalism]] and the possibility that [[reason]] is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. Descartes, nevertheless, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.<ref name=\"Preface\"/>\n\nIn his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' Descartes sets forth two proofs for God's existence. One of these is founded upon the possibility of thinking the \"idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite,\" and suggests that \"of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct.\"<ref>Descartes, Rene \"Meditations on First Philosophy, 3rd Ed., Translated from Latin by: Donald A. Cress</ref> Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic,<ref name=\"books.google.be\" /><ref name=\"KrR-5EKLSQMC p. 207\" /><ref name=\"Gh_BAAAQBAJ p. 107\" /> and one of the purposes of the ''Meditations'' was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time. [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] regarded Descartes' views as a rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of [[deism]]: \"I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God,\" while a powerful contemporary, [[Martin Schoock]], accused him of [[Atheism|atheist]] beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his ''Meditations''. The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663.<ref name=\"Descartes, Ren\u00e9 2009\"/><ref>Edward C. Mendler, ''False Truths: The Error of Relying on Authority, p. 16</ref>{{check quotation}} Descartes also wrote a response to [[Philosophical skepticism|external world skepticism]]. Through this method of scepticism, he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words, certainty. He argues that sensory [[perception]]s come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the \"propensity\" to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true \u201csubstance\u201d. But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/|title=Descartes, Rene {{!}} Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref>\n\nDescartes steered clear of theological questions, restricting his attention to showing that there is no incompatibility between his metaphysics and theological orthodoxy. He avoided trying to demonstrate theological dogmas metaphysically. When challenged that he had not established the immortality of the soul merely in showing that the soul and the body are distinct substances, for example, he replied that he 'does not take it upon himself to use the power of human reason to settle any of those matters which depend on the free will of God'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descartes - An Intellectual Biography|last=GAUKROGER|first=STEPHEN|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-19-823994-9|location=Oxford University Press Inc., New York|pages=355\u2013356}}</ref>\n\n===Natural science===\nDescartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the [[natural science]]s.<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Grosholz |first=Emily |title=Cartesian method and the problem of reduction |authorlink=Emily Grosholz |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2EtAVLU1eIAC&pg=PA1 |isbn=978-0-19-824250-5 |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=But contemporary debate has tended to...understand [Cartesian method] merely as the 'method of doubt'...I want to define Descartes' method in broader terms...to trace its impact on the domains of mathematics and [[physics]] as well as [[metaphysics]].}}</ref> For him the philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge, as he related in a letter to a French translator:<ref name=\"Preface\">{{cite web |last=Descartes |first=Ren\u00e9 |translator-last=Veitch |translator-first=John |url=http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/principles/preface.htm |title=Letter of the Author to the French Translator of the Principles of Philosophy serving for a preface |accessdate= 6 December 2011}}</ref>\n{{quote|Thus, all Philosophy is like a tree, of which Metaphysics is the root, Physics the trunk, and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk, which are reduced to three principals, namely, Medicine, Mechanics, and Ethics.

Descartes \"invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', and knowns by ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''\". He also \"pioneered the standard notation\" that uses [[Subscript and superscript|superscripts]] to show the powers or exponents; for example, the 2 used in x<sup>2</sup> to indicate x squared.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Descartes, ''Discourse de la M\u00e9thode'' (Leiden, Netherlands): Jan Maire, 1637, appended book: ''La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie'', book one, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86069594/f383.image p. 299.] From p. 299: ''\" ...

New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.</ref> He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in our system of knowledge, using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning, particularly about abstract, unknown quantities. European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli]], [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardan]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and [[Lodovico Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Equations of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity ''a<sup>2</sup>'' could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians, such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te|Vieta]], who argued that it could represent only area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in envisioning a more general science of algebra or \"universal mathematics,\" as a precursor to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.<ref>[[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (1972). New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 280\u2013281</ref>\n\nDescartes' work provided the basis for the [[calculus]] developed by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and Leibniz, who applied infinitesimal calculus to the [[Tangent#Analytical approach|tangent line problem]], thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jan |last=Gullberg |authorlink=Jan Gullberg |year=1997 |title=Mathematics From The Birth of Numbers |url=https://archive.org/details/mathematicsfromb1997gull |url-access=registration |publisher=W.W.

With this foundation of reasoning, Descartes formulated many of his theories on mechanical and geometrical physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/descartes-physics/|last=Slowik|first=Edward|title=Descartes' Physics |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Archive|date=22 August 2017|editor=Edward N.

He outlined his views on the universe in his ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''.\n\nDescartes also made contributions to the field of [[optics]]. He showed by using geometric construction and the [[law of refraction]] (also known as Descartes' law or more commonly [[Snell's law]]) that the angular radius of a [[rainbow]] is 42 degrees (i.e., the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow's centre is 42\u00b0).<ref>{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=P.A. and G.

Refusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers, Descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him. In the opening section of the ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'', an [[Early modern period|early modern]] treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic \"as if no one had written on these matters before\". His best known philosophical statement is \"[[Cogito, ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]\" ({{lang-fr|link=no|Je pense, donc je suis}}; {{lang-la|link=no| cogito, ergo sum}}), found in ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' (1637; written in French and Latin) and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644; written in Latin).<ref>This idea had already been proposed by the Spanish philosopher [[G\u00f3mez Pereira]] a hundred years ago in the form: \"I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist\" (''nosco me aliquid noscere, & quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum'').

Thought cannot be separated from me, therefore, I exist (''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Principles of Philosophy''). Most notably, this is known as ''cogito ergo sum'' (English: \"I think, therefore I am\"). Therefore, Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting; therefore, the very fact that he doubted proved his existence.  \"The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten books: Chosen by Raj Persuade|publisher=The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]]|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/181/3/258}}</ref> These two first principles\u2014I think and I exist\u2014were later confirmed by Descartes' clear and distinct perception (delineated in his [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation III: Concerning God.2C That He Exists|Third Meditation]]): that I clearly and distinctly perceive these two principles, Descartes reasoned, ensures their indubitability.\n\nDescartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form? He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however, these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a ''thinking thing''. Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines \"thought\" (''cogitatio'') as \"what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it\". Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately [[Consciousness|conscious]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Ren\u00e9 |last=Descartes |year=1644 |title=The Principles of Philosophy (IX)}}</ref> He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from [[dream argument|dreams]], and that one's mind cannot have been \"hijacked\" by an [[evil demon]] placing an illusory external world before one's senses.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{quote|And so something that I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind.<ref>Bardt, C., ''Material and Mind'' (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2019), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yk2rDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA109 p. 109].</ref>{{rp|109}}}}\n\nIn this manner, Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge, discarding [[perception]] as unreliable and, instead, admitting only [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] as a method.<ref name=\"Preface\"/>\n\n===Dualism===\n{{Further|Mind-body problem|Mind-body dualism}}\n[[File:L'homme V00083 00000004.tif|thumb|''L'homme'' (1664)]]\n\nDescartes, influenced by the [[automaton]]s on display throughout the city of Paris, began to investigate the connection between the mind and body, and how the two interact.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.whitman.edu/~herbrawt/classes/339/Descartes.pdf |title='A Brute to the Brutes?': Descartes' Treatment of Animals |last=Cottingham |first=John |author-link=John Cottingham |access-date=24 February 2018 |work=Whitman People }}</ref> His main influences for [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] were [[theology]] and [[physics]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor=20013943|title=What Moves the Mind: An Excursion in Cartesian Dualism |last=Watson |first=Richard A. |author-link=Richard Watson (philosopher) |date=January 1982 |journal=[[American Philosophical Quarterly]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=73\u201381 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}</ref> The theory on the dualism of mind and body is Descartes' signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced.

While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp, he thought it was entirely straightforward. Descartes employed the concept of ''modes'', which are the ways in which substances exist. In ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'', Descartes explained, \"we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot, conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance\". To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction,<ref name=\"David Cunning 2014 278\">{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=278}}</ref> which Descartes explained as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention. Thus, when I consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is, I make a mental abstraction.<ref name=\"David Cunning 2014 278\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Descartes, two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other.

Everything that happened, be it the motion of the [[star]]s or the growth of a [[tree]], was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose, goal or end that worked its way out within nature. Aristotle called this the \"final cause,\" and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated. Descartes' theory of dualism supports the distinction between traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and Galileo, which denied the role of a divine power and \"final causes\" in its attempts to explain nature. Descartes' dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter by expelling the final cause from the physical universe (or ''res extensa'') in favor of the mind (or ''res cogitans''). Therefore, while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern [[physics]], it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the [[soul]].<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=87}}</ref>\n\nDescartes' dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings.

These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles, and served as a metaphor for feelings, like being in high or bad spirit. These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul, or passions of the soul. Descartes distinguished six basic passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness. All of these passions, he argued, represented different combinations of the original spirit, and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions. He argued, for example, that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body. In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body, he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the [[pineal gland]] as connector.<ref>{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=86}}</ref> Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland, through animal spirits. Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits. He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on God's will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them. But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland, thus humans had to learn how to control their passions.<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 87\">{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=87}}</ref>\n\nDescartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events which influenced 19th-century [[reflex]] theory. He argued that external motions such as touch and sound reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits. Heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions, with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system, and in turn animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire.<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 87\"/> Through this chain of reactions the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process.<ref name=\"Eric Shiraev 2010 88\"/>\n\nAbove all he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was [[Divinity|divine]], thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous. Descartes' writings went on to form the basis for theories on [[emotion]]s and how [[Cognition|cognitive]] evaluations were translated into affective processes. Descartes believed that the brain resembled a working machine and unlike many of his contemporaries believed that mathematics and mechanics could explain the most complicated processes of the mind. In the 20th century [[Alan Turing]] advanced [[computer science]] based on [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]] as inspired by Descartes. His theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced [[Physiology|physiological theories]] more than 200 years after his death. The physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]] was a great admirer of Descartes.<ref>{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=88}}</ref>\n\n===Moral philosophy===\nFor Descartes, [[ethics]] was a science, the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics.<ref name=\"Preface\"/> In this way, he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind-body dualism, and defends [[free will]]. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that we should seek, and [[virtue]] consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge, because a well-informed mind will be more capable of making good [[choices]], and it also depends on mental condition. For this reason, he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body. He discussed this subject in the correspondence with [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], and as a result wrote his work ''The Passions of the Soul'', that contains a study of the [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions.<ref name=\"Blom\">Blom, John J., Descartes.

For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that, in fact, this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that this good contributes to happiness but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.<ref name=\"Blom\"/> The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his ''Discourse on the Method'' he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. This is known as his [[Discourse on the Method#Part III: Morals, and Maxims accepted while conducting Method|\"Provisional Morals\"]].\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Descartes3.jpg|thumb|Ren\u00e9 Descartes at work]]\nIn the third and fifth ''Meditation'', Descartes offers an [[Ontological argument|ontological proof]] of a benevolent God (through both the ontological argument and [[trademark argument]]). Because God is benevolent, Descartes can have some faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, for God has provided him with a working mind and [[Sensory nervous system|sensory system]] and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, Descartes finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction ''and'' perception. Regarding [[epistemology]], therefore, Descartes can be said to have contributed such ideas as a rigorous conception of [[foundationalism]] and the possibility that [[reason]] is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. Descartes, nevertheless, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.<ref name=\"Preface\"/>\n\nIn his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' Descartes sets forth two proofs for God's existence. One of these is founded upon the possibility of thinking the \"idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite,\" and suggests that \"of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct.\"<ref>Descartes, Rene \"Meditations on First Philosophy, 3rd Ed., Translated from Latin by: Donald A. Cress</ref> Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic,<ref name=\"books.google.be\" /><ref name=\"KrR-5EKLSQMC p. 207\" /><ref name=\"Gh_BAAAQBAJ p. 107\" /> and one of the purposes of the ''Meditations'' was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time. [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] regarded Descartes' views as a rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of [[deism]]: \"I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God,\" while a powerful contemporary, [[Martin Schoock]], accused him of [[Atheism|atheist]] beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his ''Meditations''. The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663.<ref name=\"Descartes, Ren\u00e9 2009\"/><ref>Edward C. Mendler, ''False Truths: The Error of Relying on Authority, p. 16</ref>{{check quotation}} Descartes also wrote a response to [[Philosophical skepticism|external world skepticism]]. Through this method of scepticism, he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words, certainty. He argues that sensory [[perception]]s come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the \"propensity\" to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true \u201csubstance\u201d. But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/|title=Descartes, Rene {{!}} Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref>\n\nDescartes steered clear of theological questions, restricting his attention to showing that there is no incompatibility between his metaphysics and theological orthodoxy. He avoided trying to demonstrate theological dogmas metaphysically. When challenged that he had not established the immortality of the soul merely in showing that the soul and the body are distinct substances, for example, he replied that he 'does not take it upon himself to use the power of human reason to settle any of those matters which depend on the free will of God'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descartes - An Intellectual Biography|last=GAUKROGER|first=STEPHEN|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-19-823994-9|location=Oxford University Press Inc., New York|pages=355\u2013356}}</ref>\n\n===Natural science===\nDescartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the [[natural science]]s.<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Grosholz |first=Emily |title=Cartesian method and the problem of reduction |authorlink=Emily Grosholz |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2EtAVLU1eIAC&pg=PA1 |isbn=978-0-19-824250-5 |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=But contemporary debate has tended to...understand [Cartesian method] merely as the 'method of doubt'...I want to define Descartes' method in broader terms...to trace its impact on the domains of mathematics and [[physics]] as well as [[metaphysics]].}}</ref> For him the philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge, as he related in a letter to a French translator:<ref name=\"Preface\">{{cite web |last=Descartes |first=Ren\u00e9 |translator-last=Veitch |translator-first=John |url=http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/principles/preface.htm |title=Letter of the Author to the French Translator of the Principles of Philosophy serving for a preface |accessdate= 6 December 2011}}</ref>\n{{quote|Thus, all Philosophy is like a tree, of which Metaphysics is the root, Physics the trunk, and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk, which are reduced to three principals, namely, Medicine, Mechanics, and Ethics.

European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli]], [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardan]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and [[Lodovico Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Equations of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity ''a<sup>2</sup>'' could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians, such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te|Vieta]], who argued that it could represent only area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in envisioning a more general science of algebra or \"universal mathematics,\" as a precursor to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.<ref>[[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (1972).

''Notae in programma'' (''Comments on a Certain Broadsheet''). A reply to Descartes' one-time disciple Henricus Regius.\n* 1648. ''La description du corps humain'' (''[[The Description of the Human Body]]''). Published posthumously by Clerselier in 1667.\n* 1648. ''Responsiones Renati Des Cartes...'' (''Conversation with Burman''). Notes on a Q&A session between Descartes and Frans Burman on 16 April 1648. Rediscovered in 1895 and published for the first time in 1896. An annotated bilingual edition (Latin with French translation), edited by Jean-Marie Beyssade, was published in 1981 (Paris: PUF).\n* 1649. ''Les passions de l'\u00e2me'' (''[[Passions of the Soul]]''). Dedicated to Princess [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate]].\n* 1657. ''Correspondance'' (three volumes: 1657, 1659, 1667). Published by Descartes' literary executor [[Claude Clerselier]]. The third edition, in 1667, was the most complete; Clerselier omitted, however, much of the material pertaining to mathematics.\n\nIn January 2010, a previously unknown letter from Descartes, dated 27 May 1641, was found by the Dutch philosopher Erik-Jan Bos when browsing through [[Google Search|Google]]. Bos found the letter mentioned in a summary of autographs kept by [[Haverford College]] in [[Haverford, Pennsylvania]]. The college was unaware that the letter had never been published. This was the third letter by Descartes found in the last 25 years.<ref>{{cite news |last=Vlasblom |first=Dirk |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2492445.ece/Unknown_letter_from_Descartes_found |title=Unknown letter from Descartes found |newspaper=[[NRC.nl]] |date=25 February 2010 |access-date=30 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023903/http://vorige.nrc.nl/international/article2492445.ece/Unknown_letter_from_Descartes_found |archive-date=8 November 2016 |language=nl |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |language=nl |url=http://www.nrc.nl/wetenschap/article2491995.ece/Hoe_Descartes_in_1641_op_andere_gedachten_kwam |title=Hoe Descartes in 1641 op andere gedachten kwam |last=Vlasblom |first=Dirk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192606/http://vorige.nrc.nl/wetenschap/article2491995.ece/Hoe_Descartes_in_1641_op_andere_gedachten_kwam |archive-date=27 October 2016 |newspaper=[[NRC.nl]]}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Handwritten letter by Descartes December 1638.jpg|Handwritten letter by Descartes, December 1638\nFile:Ren\u00e9 Descartes 1644 Principia philosophiae.jpg|''Principia philosophiae'', 1644\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Solipsism#Descartes|Solipsism]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n}}\n\n===Sources===\n====Collected editions====\n{{refbegin}}\n* ''Oeuvres de Descartes'' edited by Charles Adam and [[Paul Tannery]], Paris: L\u00e9opold Cerf, 1897\u20131913, 13 volumes; new revised edition, Paris: Vrin-CNRS, 1964\u20131974, 11 volumes (the first 5 volumes contains the correspondence).

''Ayam bakar'' literally means \"roasted chicken\" in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]].\n\n== Marination and spices ==\nIn [[Java]], the chicken is usually marinated with the mixture of ''[[kecap manis]]'' (sweet soy sauce) and [[coconut oil]], applied with a brush during grilling. The ''[[bumbu (seasoning)|bumbu]]'' spice mixture may vary among regions, but usually it consists of combination of ground [[shallot]], [[garlic]], [[chilli pepper]], [[coriander]], [[tamarind]] juice, [[candlenut]], [[turmeric]], [[galangal]] and salt.

While New York was always an expensive city, people who were not rich could live in Manhattan and \"...you didn\u2019t have to think about money every second.\" This was because, among other reasons, \"...there were a zillion bad jobs.

In particular, she has spoken about the cultural void that was left behind from losing a generation of talented artists and intellectuals. Many of these men not only produced art and intellectual culture, but they also were the passionate audiences that nurtured such culture. As she explained in a 2016 interview:<blockquote>What is culture without gay people? This is America, what is the culture? Not just New York. AIDS completely changed American culture...  And with AIDS, a whole generation of gay men died practically all at once, within a couple of years. And especially the ones that I knew. The first people who died of AIDS were artists. They were also the most interesting people... The knowing audience also died and no longer exists in a real way... There\u2019s a huge gap in what people know, and there\u2019s no context for it anymore.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>In 1987, Lebowitz published a piece in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] entitled \"The Impact of AIDS on the Artistic Community.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lebowitz|first=Fran|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/arts/the-impact-of-aids-on-the-artistic-community.html|title=The Impact of Aids on the Artistic Community|date=1987-09-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n=== Feminism ===\n\nLebowitz has been called the \"opposite of [[Lean In|lean-in]] feminism.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> She said in a 2019 interview, <blockquote>If [feminism] really worked, there wouldn\u2019t be feminism anymore.

I was, unfortunately, largely right.\" However, she had also said, \"The way girls are raised now. It\u2019s so different... when I was a child.

Lebowitz has discussed the impact of the \"plague years\" on American culture. In particular, she has spoken about the cultural void that was left behind from losing a generation of talented artists and intellectuals. Many of these men not only produced art and intellectual culture, but they also were the passionate audiences that nurtured such culture. As she explained in a 2016 interview:<blockquote>What is culture without gay people? This is America, what is the culture? Not just New York. AIDS completely changed American culture...  And with AIDS, a whole generation of gay men died practically all at once, within a couple of years. And especially the ones that I knew. The first people who died of AIDS were artists. They were also the most interesting people... The knowing audience also died and no longer exists in a real way... There\u2019s a huge gap in what people know, and there\u2019s no context for it anymore.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>In 1987, Lebowitz published a piece in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] entitled \"The Impact of AIDS on the Artistic Community.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lebowitz|first=Fran|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/arts/the-impact-of-aids-on-the-artistic-community.html|title=The Impact of Aids on the Artistic Community|date=1987-09-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n=== Feminism ===\n\nLebowitz has been called the \"opposite of [[Lean In|lean-in]] feminism.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> She said in a 2019 interview, <blockquote>If [feminism] really worked, there wouldn\u2019t be feminism anymore.

It\u2019s so much better, and yet it\u2019s still horrible. That will tell you what it was like, okay?<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>In another interview, she explained, \"I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it, largely because it never occurred to me it would work. I was, unfortunately, largely right.\" However, she had also said, \"The way girls are raised now. It\u2019s so different... when I was a child. If you wanted to do something and you were not allowed to do it, very often, the answer to why not would be: because you\u2019re a girl.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/women-arts-fran-lebowitz|title=Women in the Arts: Fran Lebowitz|last=Durbin|first=Andrew|website=Frieze|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>  \n\nOn the [[Me Too movement]], she said, <blockquote>It never occurred to me this would ever change.
