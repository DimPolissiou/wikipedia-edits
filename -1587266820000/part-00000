It was originally developed during the 1950s by French aircraft manufacturer [[Morane-Saulnier]] as the '''MS.880'''.\n\nOn 10 June 1959, the prototype Rallye conducted the type's [[maiden flight]]; on 21 November 1961, [[type certification]] for the first production versions of the aircraft, designated as the '''MS.880B''' and more powerful '''MS.885''', was awarded. Successive models of the Rallye were developed and manufactured; changes typically involved the installation of more powerful engines, structural strengthening, and the expansion of some of the [[flight control surfaces]]. As part of efforts to access the lucrative [[North America]]n market, [[distributor]] agreements were formed with multiple US-based companies, such as the [[Waco Aircraft Company]] and [[BFA Aviation]], to market, sell, and service the Rallye. These efforts, while not being trouble-free, provided valuable sales of the type.\n\nDuring 1979, SOCATA (which Morane-Saulnier had previously merged into) decided to rename all of the Rallye series' various models, each being assigned their own individual ''[[Gaul|Gallic]]'' names. During the early 1980s, the Rallye was eventually phased out of production in France in favour of the newer [[Socata TB]] series. During December 1984, the final SOCATA-built aircraft was delivered; the entire production run had covered approximately 3,300 aircraft. However, the Rallye continued to be [[Licensed production|produced under licence]] in Poland by aviation company [[PZL]], which marketed their own models under the '''PZL Koliber''' ({{lang-en|Hummingbird}}) name. On 18 April 1978, the first flight of a prototype Koliber occurred; quantity production of the type commenced in Poland during the following year.\n\n==Development==\nDuring 1958, in response to the launch of a French government competition seeking such an aircraft, French aviation company [[Morane-Saulnier]] decided to commence work upon the design of a new single-engined light aircraft, initially designated as the ''MS.880 Rallye Club''. According to aerospace publication [[Flying (magazine)|Flying Magazine]], in comparison with other light aircraft of the era, was relatively slow-moving and cheap fixed-wing aircraft; specifically, the magazine lauded the Rallye as being available \"for a price much lower than any true [[STOL]] [short takeoff and landing], four-place aircraft\".<ref name = \"tram 35\"/> It featured a relatively simplistic design which enabled it to be provided at a highly affordable price to customers, which, along with the aircraft's capable STOL performance, was viewed as being a highly attractive selling point, particularly to customers within the [[North America]]n market.<ref name = \"tram 35\">Trammell 1971, p. 35.</ref>\n\nOn 10 June 1959, the prototype Rallye, powered by a {{convert|90|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine, conducted its [[maiden flight]]. On 21 November 1961, the first production versions of the aircraft, designated as the ''MS.880B'' and more powerful ''MS.885'', received their [[type certification]], clearing them to perform operational flights.<ref name=\"Janes 76 p64\">Taylor 1976, p. 64.</ref> Thereafter, a range of improvements and alterations were progressively made upon the design as new models of the Rallye were introduced; typical advances included the adoption of more powerful engines, improved payload capability, and strengthened structure, the addition of wheel fairings, increased ground clearance for the propeller, expanded [[rudder]] and [[aileron]]s, and changes to the cockpit canopy arrangement.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/><ref name=\"planeandpilot_1999_11_30_socata_rallye\"/> \n\nOn 19 November 1962, Morane-Saulnier filed for [[bankruptcy]], and in January 1963 was placed under the control of [[Potez]], which established the {{lang|fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Exploitation des Etablissements Morane-Saulnier}} (SEEMS) to manage its assets. On 20 May 1965, [[Sud Aviation]] acquired SEEMS from Potez, forming {{lang|fr|Gerance de Etablissements Morane-Saulnier}} (GEMS).{{sfn|Simpson|1991|p=215}} In early 1966, Sud Aviation created another new subsidiary, [[SOCATA]], to continue development and production of the Rallye series.{{sfn|Simpson|1991|p=16}} SOCATA continued to manufacture the Rallye in large numbers through the remainder of the 1960s and through the 1970s.<ref name=\"Donald world p804\"/>{{sfn|Simpson|1991|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nDuring the early 1960s, a [[distributor]] arrangement between Morane-Saulnier and the American [[Ohio]]-based [[Waco Aircraft Company]] was established regarding the marketing, sale, and servicing of the Rallye throughout the sizable and attractive [[North American]] market.<ref name = \"tram 35 37\"/> While the type was sold under the Waco name, the Rallye had little time to prove itself prior to Waco winding up its aviation activities during 1971, resulting in only a handful of aircraft being delivered under its oversight.<ref name=\"planeandpilot_1999_11_30_socata_rallye\">[http://www.planeandpilotmag.com/article/socata-rallye-waco-minerva/#.WJcSsZXnZJg \"SOCATA 'Rallye'-Waco 'Minerva',\"] 30 November 1999, ''Plane & Pilot'' Magazine, Retrieved: 5 February 2017.</ref> As a consequence of Waco's dissolution, third party aviation companies purchased the various leftover assets and continued to provide spare parts and services to American owners of the Rallye.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/>\n\nIn the late 1960s, SOCATA pursued the development of an enlarged 7-seat version powered by a {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Lycoming O-540|Lycoming IO-540-K]] engine, the ST.60 Rallye 7. Two prototypes were constructed: a version with [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable]] [[tricycle landing gear]], first flown on 3 January 1969, and an otherwise similar aircraft with fixed landing gear. However, SOCATA was not confident that a sufficient market for the aircraft existed, and no further production ensued.{{sfn|Simpson|1991|p=16}}\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[New York State|Now York]]-based company [[BFA Aviation]] was appointed as the type's new distributor within North America.<ref name = \"tram 35\"/> BFA, via several subsidiaries of its parent company Aerocon Inc, performed the final assembly of the Rallye for those sold to American customers. The use of American suppliers within the aircraft's supply chain, such as the [[Franklin 6 series|Franklin 6A-350-C1]] engine, [[Hartzell Propeller|Hartzell]] or [[McCauley Propeller Systems|McCauley]]-built propellers, wheels, brakes, and some of the cockpit instrumentation, was made upon some models of the Rallye, such as the Minerva.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/> Under the initial arrangement, US-built components would be shipped across the [[Atlantic ocean]] to reach the facilities of Sud Aviation and its subsidiary companies in France for integration onto a French-built airframe which, following completion and initial test flights, would be disassembled into sections and conveyed to BFA Aviation in the United States for final assembly and sale; efforts to reduce unnecessary shipping and thus cost were explored.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/>\n\nDuring 1979, SOCATA decided to embark upon a new production programme, one of the results of which being the renaming of the various models of Rallye series, each one receiving an individual, \"more Gallic\" name.<ref name=\"History\">\"[http://www.flyrallye.com/Rallye_History/rallye_history.html Rallye History]\".

Note the type's large tail [[fin]]]]\nSOCATA's decision to terminate production in France was not the end of all manufacturing activity for the type however. During the 1970s, SOCATA had sold a [[licensed production|license for production]] of the Rallye 100ST model to the Polish State aviation company [[PZL]], which led to the aircraft being independently constructed in its facilities in [[Warsaw]] as the ''PZL Koliber'' (''Humming Bird''). On 18 April 1978, the first PZL-built aircraft performed its maiden flight. During 1979, quantity production of the Koliber commenced; an initial batch of ten aircraft was produced that year.<ref name=\"Janes 88 p193\">Taylor 1988, p. 193.</ref>\n\nDuring February 1994, type certification of the Koliber was granted by the American [[Federal Aviation Administration]], clearing the Polish derivatives to be sold and operated within the North American market.<ref name = \"benen 67\">Benenson 1995, p. 67.</ref> Shortly thereafter, a distributor arrangement was formed with [[Cadmus Corporation]] to market and service the Koliber in the Americas. Among its uses, the aircraft proved to be a good trainer, in part due to the generous visibility provided from its cockpit and forgiving flight characteristics.<ref name = \"benen 67 68\">Benenson 1995, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Socata MS-880B Rallye Club Deurne.JPG|thumb|right|A MS.880B Rallye Club]]\nThe SOCATA Rallye is a single-engined, low-wing [[monoplane]] light aircraft, capable of [[STOL]] (short takeoff and landing) performance. While not considered to be a highly aesthetic vehicle, the Rallye is considered to be sound and functional aircraft; efforts were made upon later-built aircraft to improve the type's visual appeal and to clean up the exterior.<ref>Trammell 1971, p. 35, 39\u201340.</ref> Composed of all metal construction, it is typically outfitted with a fixed [[tricycle landing gear]], complete with an offset free-castering nosewheel and relatively closely spaced main gear;<ref>Brechner, Berl. \"The Rallye 235 GT.\" ''AOPA Pilot'', October 1977. pp. 38\u201342.</ref><ref name = \"tram 37\"/> however, an alternative landing gear configuration is used upon the 235 C model, which was provisioned with fixed tailwheel landing gear instead. Unusually, the landing gear of the Rallye is [[Articulated vehicle|articulated]] in order to better withstand the sharp forces that are imposed during STOL landings.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/> Flying Magazine noted that the Rallye is \"a ''very'' nice-landing aircraft\".<ref name = \"tram 40\"/>\n\nThe Rallye is equipped with a [[cantilever]] wing, which incorporated interconnected full-span automatic [[leading edge slat]]s, wide-chord slotted [[aileron]]s, and wide-span [[Flap (aeronautics)#Fowler flap|Fowler]]-type [[trailing edge]] [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s. The combination of full-span slats and large Fowler flaps provided the aircraft with its capable slow-speed flight performance.<ref name = \"tram 35\"/> Fuel is also internally carried within the wings.<ref name = \"benen 68\">Benenson 1995, p. 68.</ref> According to Flying Magazine, the Rallye possessed a generous degree of controllability and was relatively forgiving to fly, being extremely difficult to mishandle to the point where effective control of the aircraft would be lost.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/> The aircraft is safe to fly at practically any piloting skill level. While the Rallye has fair manoeuvrability, such as during [[Aerobatic maneuver#Table of the basic aerobatic figure|loop]]s and [[Slow roll (aeronautics)|roll]]s, the execution of [[aerobatic maneuver]]s is not officially approved by the manufacturer.<ref name = \"tram 39 40\">Trammell 1971, pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\nThe aircraft's power was provided from one of a range of progressively more powerful air-cooled engines; such as the early Rallye Cub model, which was powered by a single [[Continental O-200-A]] engine, capable of generating up to {{convert|100|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, while the newer Rallye 235 variant was furnished with a [[Lycoming O-540]] engine, which provided a maximum of {{convert|235|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The method for both the ignition and run-up of the engine were relatively conventional.<ref name = \"tram 40\"/> In order to achieve a substantial increase in performance, which is useful for the execution of a STOL takeoff run, weight minimisation efforts should be made, such as carrying as little fuel and payload as is reasonably possible.<ref name = \"tram 40\"/>\n\n[[File:A\u00e9rodrome La V\u00e8ze 05.jpg|thumb|left|In-cockpit view of a Rallye, 2011]]\nThe Rallye was fitted with a bulbous cockpit, which was capable of accommodating two/three people in the basic lower-powered variants and up to four personnel within the more powerful models of the aircraft, some of which were designed to function as [[gliding|glider tug]]s and [[Aerial advertising#Fixed-wing aircraft|banner bearers]].<ref name = \"tram 39\">Trammell 1971, p. 39.</ref> The canopy slides rearwards to provide access to and from the cockpit, aided by a step located just underneath the wing's trailing edge; on the ground. On the ground, the canopy should remain slightly open when occupied to allow for adequate airflow; in flight, the canopy can be left open at speed up to a maximum of 94 knots.<ref name = \"tram 40\"/><ref name = \"benen 68\"/>\n\nThe cockpit has been described as being relatively noisy, but also often praised for the provision of excellent external visibility; Flight Magazine stated that \"It is almost like being in a four-place open cockpit plane\". Typically, the Rallye would be furnished with dual flying controls, each being complete with their own [[centre stick|control stick]], upon which controls for the [[intercom]] would be often mounted.<ref name = \"tram 40\">Trammell 1971, p. 40.</ref><ref name = \"benen 68\"/> While fully featured cockpit instrumentation was an available option to be installed upon the Rallye, the additional weight of this equipment would noticeably impact the aircraft's performance; thus, customers would have to weigh up the benefits of having superior flight performance or being able to make use of greater amount of cockpit features.<ref name = \"benen 69\">Benenson 1995, p. 69.</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===French production===\n;MS.880\n:Original production version.

It was originally developed during the 1950s by French aircraft manufacturer [[Morane-Saulnier]] as the '''MS.880'''.\n\nOn 10 June 1959, the prototype Rallye conducted the type's [[maiden flight]]; on 21 November 1961, [[type certification]] for the first production versions of the aircraft, designated as the '''MS.880B''' and more powerful '''MS.885''', was awarded. Successive models of the Rallye were developed and manufactured; changes typically involved the installation of more powerful engines, structural strengthening, and the expansion of some of the [[flight control surfaces]]. As part of efforts to access the lucrative [[North America]]n market, [[distributor]] agreements were formed with multiple US-based companies, such as the [[Waco Aircraft Company]] and [[BFA Aviation]], to market, sell, and service the Rallye. These efforts, while not being trouble-free, provided valuable sales of the type.\n\nDuring 1979, SOCATA (which Morane-Saulnier had previously merged into) decided to rename all of the Rallye series' various models, each being assigned their own individual ''[[Gaul|Gallic]]'' names. During the early 1980s, the Rallye was eventually phased out of production in France in favour of the newer [[Socata TB]] series. During December 1984, the final SOCATA-built aircraft was delivered; the entire production run had covered approximately 3,300 aircraft. However, the Rallye continued to be [[Licensed production|produced under licence]] in Poland by aviation company [[PZL]], which marketed their own models under the '''PZL Koliber''' ({{lang-en|Hummingbird}}) name. On 18 April 1978, the first flight of a prototype Koliber occurred; quantity production of the type commenced in Poland during the following year.\n\n==Development==\nDuring 1958, in response to the launch of a French government competition seeking such an aircraft, French aviation company [[Morane-Saulnier]] decided to commence work upon the design of a new single-engined light aircraft, initially designated as the ''MS.880 Rallye Club''. According to aerospace publication [[Flying (magazine)|Flying Magazine]], in comparison with other light aircraft of the era, was relatively slow-moving and cheap fixed-wing aircraft; specifically, the magazine lauded the Rallye as being available \"for a price much lower than any true [[STOL]] [short takeoff and landing], four-place aircraft\".<ref name = \"tram 35\"/> It featured a relatively simplistic design which enabled it to be provided at a highly affordable price to customers, which, along with the aircraft's capable STOL performance, was viewed as being a highly attractive selling point, particularly to customers within the [[North America]]n market.<ref name = \"tram 35\">Trammell 1971, p. 35.</ref>\n\nOn 10 June 1959, the prototype Rallye, powered by a {{convert|90|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine, conducted its [[maiden flight]]. On 21 November 1961, the first production versions of the aircraft, designated as the ''MS.880B'' and more powerful ''MS.885'', received their [[type certification]], clearing them to perform operational flights.<ref name=\"Janes 76 p64\">Taylor 1976, p. 64.</ref> Thereafter, a range of improvements and alterations were progressively made upon the design as new models of the Rallye were introduced; typical advances included the adoption of more powerful engines, improved payload capability, and strengthened structure, the addition of wheel fairings, increased ground clearance for the propeller, expanded [[rudder]] and [[aileron]]s, and changes to the cockpit canopy arrangement.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/><ref name=\"planeandpilot_1999_11_30_socata_rallye\"/> \n\nOn 19 November 1962, Morane-Saulnier filed for [[bankruptcy]], and in January 1963 was placed under the control of [[Potez]], which established the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Exploitation des Etablissements Morane-Saulnier (\"SEEMS\") to manage its assets. On 20 May 1965, [[Sud Aviation]] acquired SEEMS from Potez, forming Gerance de Etablissements Morane-Saulnier (\"GEMS\").{{sfn|Simpson|1991|p=215}} In early 1966, Sud Aviation created another new subsidiary, [[SOCATA]], to continue development and production of the Rallye series.{{sfn|Simpson|1991|p=16}} SOCATA continued to manufacture the Rallye in large numbers through the remainder of the 1960s and through the 1970s.<ref name=\"Donald world p804\"/>{{sfn|Simpson|1991|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nDuring the early 1960s, a [[distributor]] arrangement between Morane-Saulnier and the American [[Ohio]]-based [[Waco Aircraft Company]] was established regarding the marketing, sale, and servicing of the Rallye throughout the sizable and attractive [[North American]] market.<ref name = \"tram 35 37\"/> While the type was sold under the Waco name, the Rallye had little time to prove itself prior to Waco winding up its aviation activities during 1971, resulting in only a handful of aircraft being delivered under its oversight.<ref name=\"planeandpilot_1999_11_30_socata_rallye\">[http://www.planeandpilotmag.com/article/socata-rallye-waco-minerva/#.WJcSsZXnZJg \"SOCATA 'Rallye'-Waco 'Minerva',\"] 30 November 1999, ''Plane & Pilot'' Magazine, Retrieved: 5 February 2017.</ref> As a consequence of Waco's dissolution, third party aviation companies purchased the various leftover assets and continued to provide spare parts and services to American owners of the Rallye.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/>\n\nIn the late 1960s, SOCATA pursued the development of an enlarged 7-seat version powered by a {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Lycoming O-540|Lycoming IO-540-K]] engine, the ST.60 Rallye 7. Two prototypes were constructed: a version with [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable]] [[tricycle landing gear]], first flown on 3 January 1969, and an otherwise similar aircraft with fixed landing gear. However, SOCATA was not confident that a sufficient market for the aircraft existed, and no further production ensued.{{sfn|Simpson|1991|p=16}}\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[New York State|Now York]]-based company [[BFA Aviation]] was appointed as the type's new distributor within North America.<ref name = \"tram 35\"/> BFA, via several subsidiaries of its parent company Aerocon Inc, performed the final assembly of the Rallye for those sold to American customers. The use of American suppliers within the aircraft's supply chain, such as the [[Franklin 6 series|Franklin 6A-350-C1]] engine, [[Hartzell Propeller|Hartzell]] or [[McCauley Propeller Systems|McCauley]]-built propellers, wheels, brakes, and some of the cockpit instrumentation, was made upon some models of the Rallye, such as the Minerva.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/> Under the initial arrangement, US-built components would be shipped across the [[Atlantic ocean]] to reach the facilities of Sud Aviation and its subsidiary companies in France for integration onto a French-built airframe which, following completion and initial test flights, would be disassembled into sections and conveyed to BFA Aviation in the United States for final assembly and sale; efforts to reduce unnecessary shipping and thus cost were explored.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/>\n\nDuring 1979, SOCATA decided to embark upon a new production programme, one of the results of which being the renaming of the various models of Rallye series, each one receiving an individual, \"more Gallic\" name.<ref name=\"History\">\"[http://www.flyrallye.com/Rallye_History/rallye_history.html Rallye History]\".

Note the type's large tail [[fin]]]]\nSOCATA's decision to terminate production in France was not the end of all manufacturing activity for the type however. During the 1970s, SOCATA had sold a [[licensed production|license for production]] of the Rallye 100ST model to the Polish State aviation company [[PZL]], which led to the aircraft being independently constructed in its facilities in [[Warsaw]] as the ''PZL Koliber'' (''Humming Bird''). On 18 April 1978, the first PZL-built aircraft performed its maiden flight. During 1979, quantity production of the Koliber commenced; an initial batch of ten aircraft was produced that year.<ref name=\"Janes 88 p193\">Taylor 1988, p. 193.</ref>\n\nDuring February 1994, type certification of the Koliber was granted by the American [[Federal Aviation Administration]], clearing the Polish derivatives to be sold and operated within the North American market.<ref name = \"benen 67\">Benenson 1995, p. 67.</ref> Shortly thereafter, a distributor arrangement was formed with [[Cadmus Corporation]] to market and service the Koliber in the Americas. Among its uses, the aircraft proved to be a good trainer, in part due to the generous visibility provided from its cockpit and forgiving flight characteristics.<ref name = \"benen 67 68\">Benenson 1995, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Socata MS-880B Rallye Club Deurne.JPG|thumb|right|A MS.880B Rallye Club]]\nThe SOCATA Rallye is a single-engined, low-wing [[monoplane]] light aircraft, capable of [[STOL]] (short takeoff and landing) performance. While not considered to be a highly aesthetic vehicle, the Rallye is considered to be sound and functional aircraft; efforts were made upon later-built aircraft to improve the type's visual appeal and to clean up the exterior.<ref>Trammell 1971, p. 35, 39\u201340.</ref> Composed of all metal construction, it is typically outfitted with a fixed [[tricycle landing gear]], complete with an offset free-castering nosewheel and relatively closely spaced main gear;<ref>Brechner, Berl. \"The Rallye 235 GT.\" ''AOPA Pilot'', October 1977. pp. 38\u201342.</ref><ref name = \"tram 37\"/> however, an alternative landing gear configuration is used upon the 235 C model, which was provisioned with fixed tailwheel landing gear instead. Unusually, the landing gear of the Rallye is [[Articulated vehicle|articulated]] in order to better withstand the sharp forces that are imposed during STOL landings.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/> Flying Magazine noted that the Rallye is \"a ''very'' nice-landing aircraft\".<ref name = \"tram 40\"/>\n\nThe Rallye is equipped with a [[cantilever]] wing, which incorporated interconnected full-span automatic [[leading edge slat]]s, wide-chord slotted [[aileron]]s, and wide-span [[Flap (aeronautics)#Fowler flap|Fowler]]-type [[trailing edge]] [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s. The combination of full-span slats and large Fowler flaps provided the aircraft with its capable slow-speed flight performance.<ref name = \"tram 35\"/> Fuel is also internally carried within the wings.<ref name = \"benen 68\">Benenson 1995, p. 68.</ref> According to Flying Magazine, the Rallye possessed a generous degree of controllability and was relatively forgiving to fly, being extremely difficult to mishandle to the point where effective control of the aircraft would be lost.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/> The aircraft is safe to fly at practically any piloting skill level. While the Rallye has fair manoeuvrability, such as during [[Aerobatic maneuver#Table of the basic aerobatic figure|loop]]s and [[Slow roll (aeronautics)|roll]]s, the execution of [[aerobatic maneuver]]s is not officially approved by the manufacturer.<ref name = \"tram 39 40\">Trammell 1971, pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\nThe aircraft's power was provided from one of a range of progressively more powerful air-cooled engines; such as the early Rallye Cub model, which was powered by a single [[Continental O-200-A]] engine, capable of generating up to {{convert|100|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, while the newer Rallye 235 variant was furnished with a [[Lycoming O-540]] engine, which provided a maximum of {{convert|235|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The method for both the ignition and run-up of the engine were relatively conventional.<ref name = \"tram 40\"/> In order to achieve a substantial increase in performance, which is useful for the execution of a STOL takeoff run, weight minimisation efforts should be made, such as carrying as little fuel and payload as is reasonably possible.<ref name = \"tram 40\"/>\n\n[[File:A\u00e9rodrome La V\u00e8ze 05.jpg|thumb|left|In-cockpit view of a Rallye, 2011]]\nThe Rallye was fitted with a bulbous cockpit, which was capable of accommodating two/three people in the basic lower-powered variants and up to four personnel within the more powerful models of the aircraft, some of which were designed to function as [[gliding|glider tug]]s and [[Aerial advertising#Fixed-wing aircraft|banner bearers]].<ref name = \"tram 39\">Trammell 1971, p. 39.</ref> The canopy slides rearwards to provide access to and from the cockpit, aided by a step located just underneath the wing's trailing edge; on the ground. On the ground, the canopy should remain slightly open when occupied to allow for adequate airflow; in flight, the canopy can be left open at speed up to a maximum of 94 knots.<ref name = \"tram 40\"/><ref name = \"benen 68\"/>\n\nThe cockpit has been described as being relatively noisy, but also often praised for the provision of excellent external visibility; Flight Magazine stated that \"It is almost like being in a four-place open cockpit plane\". Typically, the Rallye would be furnished with dual flying controls, each being complete with their own [[centre stick|control stick]], upon which controls for the [[intercom]] would be often mounted.<ref name = \"tram 40\">Trammell 1971, p. 40.</ref><ref name = \"benen 68\"/> While fully featured cockpit instrumentation was an available option to be installed upon the Rallye, the additional weight of this equipment would noticeably impact the aircraft's performance; thus, customers would have to weigh up the benefits of having superior flight performance or being able to make use of greater amount of cockpit features.<ref name = \"benen 69\">Benenson 1995, p. 69.</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===French production===\n;MS.880\n:Original production version.

He is also known for his use of [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]] in the dialogue, titles, and themes of his films. Kiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements. The concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami's works.\n\n==Early life and background==\n[[File:UT honarhaye ziba.jpg|thumb|right|Kiarostami majored in painting and graphic design at the [[University of Tehran]] College of Fine arts.]]\nKiarostami was born in [[Tehran]].

Between 1962 and 1966, he shot around 150 advertisements for Iranian television. In the late 1960s, he began creating credit titles for films (including ''[[Qeysar (film)|Gheysar]]'' by [[Masoud Kimiai]]) and illustrating children's books.<ref name=\"AKzeitgeit\"/><ref name=\"AKOpenDemocracy\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.opendemocracy.net/arts-Film/article_815.jsp\n| title = 10 x Ten: Kiarostami's journey\n| accessdate = 23 February 2007\n| year = 2002\n| author = Ed Hayes\n| publisher = Open Democracy\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070109164930/http://www.opendemocracy.net/arts-Film/article_815.jsp\n| archivedate = 9 January 2007\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n==Film career==\n{{see also|Abbas Kiarostami filmography}}\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1970 when the [[Iranian New Wave]] began with [[Dariush Mehrjui]]'s film ''[[The Cow (1969 film)|G\u0101v]]'', Kiarostami helped set up a filmmaking department at the Institute for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults (Kanun) in Tehran. Its debut production, and Kiarostami's first film, was the twelve-minute ''[[The Bread and Alley]]'' (1970), a [[Neorealism (art)|neo-realistic]] short film about a schoolboy's confrontation with an aggressive dog. ''[[Breaktime]]'' followed in 1972. The department became one of Iran's most noted film studios, producing not only Kiarostami's films, but acclaimed Persian films such as ''[[The Runner (Davandeh)|The Runner]]'' and ''[[Bashu, the Little Stranger]]''.<ref name=\"AKzeitgeit\"/>\n\nIn the 1970s, Kiarostami pursued an [[individualism|individualistic]] style of film making.<ref name=\"AKStrictFS\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.filmref.com/journal2002.html\n |title       = Notes on Close Up \u2013 Iranian Cinema: Past, Present and Future\n |accessdate  = 23 February 2007\n|year        = 2002\n |author      = Hamid Dabashi\n |publisher   = Strictly Film School\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217181716/http://www.filmref.com/journal2002.html\n |archivedate = 17 February 2007\n|url-status     = dead\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> When discussing his first film, he stated:\n<blockquote>''Bread and Alley'' was my first experience in cinema and I must say a very difficult one. I had to work with a very young child, a dog, and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging and complaining all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.<ref name = \"AKSynoptique\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nFollowing ''[[The Experience (film)|The Experience]]'' (1973), Kiarostami released  ''[[The Traveler (1974 film)|The Traveler]]'' (''Mossafer'') in 1974. ''The Traveler'' tells the story of Qassem Julayi, a troubled and troublesome boy from a small Iranian city. Intent on attending a football match in far-off Tehran, he scams his friends and neighbors to raise money, and journeys to the stadium in time for the game, only to meet with an ironic twist of fate. In addressing the boy's determination to reach his goal, alongside his indifference to the effects of his amoral actions, the film examined human behavior and the balance of right and wrong. It furthered Kiarostami's reputation for [[Realism (dramatic arts)|realism]], [[Diegesis|diegetic]] simplicity, and stylistic complexity, as well as his fascination with physical and spiritual journeys.<ref name=\"BBCAKseason\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/festivals/abbas_kiarostami_2005.shtml\n| title = Abbas Kiarostami Season\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2005\n| author = David Parkinson\n| publisher = BBC\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Kiarostami directed two short films ''[[So Can I]]'' and ''[[Two Solutions for One Problem]]''.

In 1979, he produced and directed ''[[First Case, Second Case]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===1980s===\nIn the early 1980s, Kiarostami directed several short films including ''[[Toothache (film)|Toothache]]'' (1980), ''[[Orderly or Disorderly]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Chorus (Kiarostami film)|The Chorus]]'' (1982). In 1983, he directed ''[[Fellow Citizen]].'' It was not until his release of ''[[Where Is the Friend's Home?]]'' that he began to gain recognition outside Iran.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}These films created the basis of his later productions.\n\nThe film tells a simple account of a conscientious eight-year-old schoolboy's quest to return his friend's notebook in a neighboring village lest his friend be expelled from school. The traditional beliefs of Iranian rural people are portrayed. The film has been noted for its poetic use of the Iranian rural landscape and its realism, both important elements of Kiarostami's work.

The films also relate to the [[1990 Manjil\u2013Rudbar earthquake]], in which 40,000&nbsp;people died. Kiarostami uses the themes of life, death, change, and continuity to connect the films.

The family suspects theft as the motive for this charade, but the impersonator, Hossein Sabzian, argues that his motives were more complex.

While the cinematographer wanted separate shots of the boy approaching, a [[close-up]] of his hand as he enters the house and closes the door, followed by a shot of the dog, Kiarostami believed that if the three scenes could be captured as a whole it would have a more profound impact in creating tension over the situation. That one shot took around forty days to complete, until Kiarostami was fully content with the scene. Kiarostami later commented that the breaking of scenes would have disrupted the [[rhythm]] and content of the film's structure, preferring to let the scene flow as one.<ref name = \"AKSynoptique\"/>\n\nUnlike other directors, Kiarostami showed no interest in staging extravagant [[combat]] scenes or complicated chase scenes in large-scale productions, instead attempting to mold the medium of film to his own specifications.<ref name=\"IHFAkrami\"/> Kiarostami appeared to have settled on his style with the ''Koker trilogy'', which included a myriad of references to his own film material, connecting common themes and subject matter between each of the films. Stephen Bransford has contended that Kiarostami's films do not contain references to the work of other directors, but are fashioned in such a manner that they are self-referenced. Bransford believes his films are often fashioned into an ongoing dialectic with one film reflecting on and partially demystifying an earlier film.<ref name=\"SenseCinemaAK1\"/>\n\nHe continued experimenting with new modes of filming, using different directorial methods and techniques. A case in point is ''Ten'', which was filmed in a moving automobile in which Kiarostami was not present. He gave suggestions to the actors about what to do, and a camera placed on the [[dashboard]] filmed them while they drove around Tehran.<ref name=\"AKSynoptique\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.synoptique.ca/core/en/articles/kiarostami_interview\n| title = A Talk with the Artist: Abbas Kiarostami in Conversation\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2004\n| author = Shahin Parhami\n| publisher =Synoptique\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Liberty\">{{cite web\n| url =http://www.macalester.edu/weekly/120503/arts01.html\n| title =With liberty for all: the films of Kiarostami\n| accessdate=27 February 2007\n| year = 2003\n| author = Ben Sachs\n| work =The Mac Weekly\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060922072655/http://www.macalester.edu/weekly/120503/arts01.html | archivedate = 22 September 2006}}</ref> The camera was allowed to roll, capturing the faces of the people involved during their daily routine, using a series of extreme-close shots. ''Ten'' was an experiment that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director.

According to film professors such as Jamsheed Akrami of [[William Paterson University]], Kiarostami consistently tried to redefine film by forcing the increased involvement of the audience. In his later years, he also progressively trimmed the timespan within his films. Akrami thinks that this reduces the filmmaking from a collective endeavor to a purer, more basic form of artistic expression.<ref name=\"IHFAkrami\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.iranheritage.com/kiarostamiconference/abstracts_full.htm\n| title = Cooling Down a 'Hot Medium'\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2005\n| author = Jamsheed Akrami\n| publisher =Iran Heritage Foundation\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221105/http://www.iranheritage.com/kiarostamiconference/abstracts_full.htm\n| archivedate = 27 September 2007\n| url-status =dead\n}}</ref>\n\n===Fiction and non-fiction===\n[[File:Kiarostami & Bavi.jpg|thumb|Kiarostami interviewing with {{Interlanguage link multi|Habib Bavi|fa|3=\u062d\u0628\u06cc\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0648\u06cc \u0633\u0627\u062c\u062f}} in 2013]]\nKiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements ([[docufiction]]).

''Life and Nothing More...'', he argues, is neither representation nor reportage, but rather ''\"evidence\"'':\n<blockquote>[I]t all looks like reporting, but everything underscores (''indique \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence'') that it is the fiction of a documentary (in fact, Kiarostami shot the film several months after the earthquake), and that it is rather a document about \"fiction\": not in the sense of imagining the unreal, but in the very specific and precise sense of the technique, of the ''art'' of constructing images. For the image by means of which, each time, each opens a world and precedes himself in it (''s'y pr\u00e9c\u00e8de'') is not pregiven (''donn\u00e9e toute faite'') (as are those of dreams, phantasms or bad films): it is to be invented, cut and edited. Thus it is ''evidence'', insofar as, if one day I happen to ''look'' at my street on which I walk up and down ten times a day, I construct for an instant a new ''evidence'' of my street.<ref>Jean-Luc Nancy, \"On Evidence: ''Life and Nothing More'', by Abbas Kiarostami,\" ''Discourse'' 21.1 (1999), p.82. Also, cf., Jean Luc Nancy. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110611115020/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-luc-nancy/articles/is-cinema-renewing-itself/ Is Cinema Renewing Itself?] ''Film-Philosophy''. vol. 6 no. 15, July 2002.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor Jean-Luc Nancy, this notion of cinema as ''\"evidence\"'', rather than as documentary or imagination, is tied to the way Kiarostami deals with life-and-death (cf. the remark by Geoff Andrew on ''ABC Africa'', cited above, to the effect that Kiarostami's films are not about death but about life-and-death):\n<blockquote> Existence resists the indifference of life-and-death, it lives beyond mechanical \"life,\" it is always its own mourning, and its own joy. It becomes figure, image. It does not become alienated in images, but it is presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the objectivity of its assertion. This thought\u2014which, for me, is the very thought of this film [''Life and Nothing More...'']\u2014is a difficult thought, perhaps the most difficult. It's a slow thought, always under way, fraying a path so that the path itself becomes thought.

Because ''\"existence\"'' means more than simply life, it is projective, containing an irreducibly fictive element, but in this \"being more than\" life, it is therefore contaminated by mortality. Nancy is giving a clue, in other words, toward the interpretation of Kiarostami's statement that lying is the only way to truth.<ref>Jean-Luc Nancy, ''The Evidence of Film \u2013 Abbas Kiarostami'', Yves Gevaert, Belgium 2001, {{ISBN|2-930128-17-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Al-Ahram\">{{cite web\n |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/556/cu1.htm \n |title=Strategic lies \n |accessdate=23 February 2007 |year=2001 \n |author=Injy El-Kashef and Mohamed El-Assyouti \n |work=Al-Ahram Weekly \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217222234/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/556/cu1.htm \n |archivedate=17 February 2007 |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\n===Themes of life and death===\n[[File:Abbas Kiarostami & Paulo Branco at Estoril Film Festival 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Kiarostami (left) at the Estoril Film Festival in 2010]]\nThe concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami's works. In the ''Koker trilogy'', these themes play a central role. As illustrated in the aftermath of the [[1990 Manjil\u2013Rudbar earthquake]] disaster, they also represent the power of human resilience to overcome and defy destruction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/apr/28/hayfilmfestival2005.guardianhayfestival|title=Abbas Kiarostami|date=28 April 2005|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 August 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the Koker films, which convey an instinctual thirst for survival, ''[[Taste of Cherry]]'' explores the fragility of life and focuses on how precious it is.<ref name=\"CriterionAK\"/>\n\nSymbols of death abound in ''The Wind Will Carry Us,'' with the scenery of the graveyard, the imminence of the old woman's passing, and the ancestors referred to early in the film by the character Farzad. Such devices prompt the viewer to reflect on the [[parameter]]s of the afterlife and immaterial existence. The viewer is asked to consider what constitutes the soul, and what happens to it after death. In discussing the film, Kiarostami said that he is the person who raises questions, rather than answers them.<ref name=\"Beyond\">{{cite web\n| url = http://reverseshot.org/archive/entry/267/wind_will_carry_us\n| title = Beyond Borders\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2004\n| author = Michael J. Anderson\n| publisher = reverse shot\n}}</ref>\n\nSome film critics believe that the assemblage of light versus dark scenes in Kiarostami's film grammar, such as in ''Taste of Cherry'' and ''The Wind Will Carry Us'', suggests the mutual existence of life with its endless possibilities, and death as a factual moment of anyone's life.<ref name=\"Khatereh\">{{cite journal\n| title =Kiarostami and the Aesthetics of Modern Persian Poetry\n|journal = Iranian Studies|volume = 39|issue = 4|pages = 509\u2013537| year = 2006\n| author = Khatereh Sheibani\n| doi =10.1080/00210860601005088\n}}</ref><!--{{Cite journal}} should be used here-->\n\n===Visual and audio techniques===\nKiarostami's style is notable for the use of panoramic long shots, such as in the closing sequences of ''Life and Nothing More'' and ''Through the Olive Trees'', where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to stimulate reflection on their fate. ''Taste of Cherry'' is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is conversing with a passenger. However, the visual distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the sound of the dialog, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of a private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity can be seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.<ref name=\"ChicagoReaderAK\"/>\n\nThis relationship between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is also present in the opening sequence to ''The Wind Will Carry Us''. Michael J. Anderson has argued that such a [[Theme (arts)|thematic]] application of this central concept of ''presence without presence'', through using such techniques, and by often referring to characters which the viewer does not see and sometimes not hear directly affects the nature and concept of space in the [[Geography|geographical]] framework in which the world is portrayed. Kiarostami's use of sound and [[image]]ry conveys a world beyond what is directly visible and/or audible, which Anderson believes emphasizes the interconnectedness and shrinking of time and space in the modern world of telecommunications.<ref name=\"Beyond\"/>\n\nOther commentators such as [[Film criticism|film critic]] Ben Zipper believe that Kiarostami's work as a landscape artist is evident in his compositional distant shots of the dry hills throughout a number of his films directly impacting on his construction on the rural landscapes within his films.<ref name=\"Khatereh\"/>\n\n===Poetry and imagery===\n[[Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak]], of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], argues that one aspect of Kiarostami's cinematic style is that he is able to capture the essence of [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]] and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In several of his movies such as ''Where is the Friend's Home'' and ''The Wind Will Carry Us'', classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.<ref name=\"Hakkak-poetry\">Karimi-Hakkak, Ahmad. \"From Kinetic Poetics to a Poetic Cinema: Abbas Kiarostami and the Esthetics of Persian Poetry.\" University of Maryland (2005)</ref>\nThe characters recite poems mainly from classical Persian poet [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]] or modern Persian poets such as [[Sohrab Sepehri]] and [[Forough Farrokhzad]]. One scene in ''The Wind Will Carry Us'' has a long shot of a wheat field with rippling golden crops through which the doctor, accompanied by the filmmaker, is riding his scooter in a twisting road. In response to the comment that the other world is a better place than this one, the doctor recites this poem of Khayyam:<ref name=\"Khatereh\"/>\n\n<blockquote><poem>They promise of [[houri]]es in heaven\nBut I would say wine is better\nTake the present to the promises\nA drum sounds melodious from distance</poem></blockquote><!-- Whose translation of the poem is this? If it's Fitzgerald, maybe we should add another one that is more faithful to the original?-->\n\nHowever, the aesthetic element involved with the poetry goes much farther back in time and is used more subtly than these examples suggest. Beyond issues of adaptation of text to film, Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian poetry, both classical and modern. This prominently results in enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film.<ref name=\"Hakkak-poetry\"/>\n\nIt has been argued that the creative merit of Kiarostami's adaptation of Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad's poems extends the domain of textual transformation. Adaptation is defined as the transformation of a prior to a new text. Sima Daad of the [[University of Washington]] contends that Kiarostami's adaptation arrives at the theoretical realm of adaptation by expanding its limit from inter-textual potential to trans-generic potential.<ref name=\"SimaDaad\">{{cite web\n| url =http://www.iranheritage.com/kiarostamiconference/abstracts_full.htm\n| title =Adaption, Fidelity, and Transformation: Kiarostami and the Modernist Poetry of Iran\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2005\n| author = Sima Daad\n| publisher =Iran Heritage Foundation\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221105/http://www.iranheritage.com/kiarostamiconference/abstracts_full.htm\n| archivedate = 27 September 2007\n| url-status =dead\n}}</ref>\n\n===Spirituality===\nKiarostami's films often reflect upon immaterial concepts such as soul and afterlife. At times, however, the very concept of the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium. Some film theorists have argued that ''The Wind Will Carry Us'' provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] reality. The limits of the frame, the material representation of a space in dialog with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those which may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the ''[[mise en sc\u00e8ne]],'' Kiarostami expands the space of the art.<ref name=\"Beyond\"/>\n\nKiarostami's \"complex\" sound-images and philosophical approach have caused frequent comparisons with \"mystical\" filmmakers such as [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and [[Robert Bresson]]. While acknowledging substantial cultural differences, much of Western critical writing about Kiarostami positions him as the Iranian equivalent of such directors, by virtue of a similarly austere, \"spiritual\" poetics and moral commitment.<ref name=\"Hamish\">{{cite web\n| url =http://sensesofcinema.com/2006/book-reviews/cinema_kiarostami/\n| title =The Cinema of Abbas Kiarostami by Alberto Elena\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2005\n| author = Hamish Ford\n| publisher =Sense of Cinema\n}}</ref> Some draw parallels between certain imagery in Kiarostami's films with that of [[Sufi]] concepts.<ref name=\"Pak\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.iranheritage.org/kiarostamiconference/abstracts_full.htm#j\n| title = Religion and Spirituality in Kiarostami's Works\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2005\n| author = Nacim Pak\n| publisher = Iran Heritage Foundation\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221105/http://www.iranheritage.com/kiarostamiconference/abstracts_full.htm#j\n| archivedate = 27 September 2007\n| url-status =dead\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile most English-language writers, such as David Sterritt and the Spanish film professor Alberto Elena, interpret Kiarostami's films as spiritual, other critics, including [[David Walsh (writer)|David Walsh]] and Hamish Ford, have not rated its influence in his films as lower.<ref name=\"CriterionAK\"/><ref name=\"Hamish\"/><ref name=\"Pak\"/> <!-- What do they think instead? -->\n\n==Poetry, art and photography==\n[[File:7chenar A.K2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Installation art by Abbas Kiarostami]]\nKiarostami, along with [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Derek Jarman]] and [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], was a filmmaker who expressed himself in other genres, such as poetry, [[set design]]s, painting, or photography.

His photographic work includes ''Untitled Photographs'', a collection of over thirty photographs, mostly of snow landscapes, taken in his hometown Tehran, between 1978 and 2003. In 1999, he also published a collection of his poems.<ref name=\"AKzeitgeit\"/><ref>[http://www.jornaldeleiria.pt/index.php?article=1026&visual=1 ''Kiarostami mostra fotos de neve'' (Kiarostami shows snow photographs)] (Portuguese) \u2013 a newspaper article on the display of ''Untitled Photographs'' in [[Lisbon]].</ref> Kiarostami also produced Mozart's opera, ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]'', which premiered in [[Aix-en-Provence]] in 2003 before being performed at the [[English National Opera]] in London in 2004.<ref name=\"GinsbergLippard2010\"/>\n\nRiccardo Zipoli, from the [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]], has studied the relations and interconnections between Kiarostami's poems and his films.

Camera placement, likewise, often defies standard audience expectations: in the closing sequences of ''Life and Nothing More'' and ''Through the Olive Trees'', the audience is forced to imagine the dialogue and circumstances of important scenes. In ''Homework'' and ''Close-Up'', parts of the soundtrack are masked or silenced. Critics have argued that the subtlety of Kiarostami's cinematic expression is largely resistant to critical analysis.<ref>[[Daniel Ross (philosopher)|Daniel Ross]], [http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/20/10.html Review of Geoff Andrew, ''Ten''.]</ref>\n\nWhile Kiarostami has won significant acclaim in Europe for several of his films, the Iranian government has refused to permit the screening of his films, to which he responded \"The government has decided not to show any of my films for the past 10 years...

He was also a poet, photographer, painter, illustrator, and [[graphic designer]]. He was part of a generation of filmmakers in the [[Iranian New Wave]], a [[Cinema of Iran|Persian cinema]] movement that started in the late 1960s and includes pioneering directors such as [[Bahram Beyzai]], [[Nasser Taghvai]], [[Ali Hatami]], [[Masoud Kimiai]], [[Dariush Mehrjui]], [[Sohrab Shahid Saless|Sohrab Shahid-Saless]] and [[Parviz Kimiavi]].

He is also known for his use of [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]] in the dialogue, titles, and themes of his films. Kiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements. The concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami's works.\n\n==Early life and background==\n[[File:UT honarhaye ziba.jpg|thumb|right|Kiarostami majored in painting and graphic design at the [[University of Tehran]] College of Fine arts.]]\nKiarostami was born in [[Tehran]].

Between 1962 and 1966, he shot around 150 advertisements for Iranian television. In the late 1960s, he began creating credit titles for films (including ''[[Qeysar (film)|Gheysar]]'' by [[Masoud Kimiai]]) and illustrating children's books.<ref name=\"AKzeitgeit\"/><ref name=\"AKOpenDemocracy\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.opendemocracy.net/arts-Film/article_815.jsp\n| title = 10 x Ten: Kiarostami's journey\n| accessdate = 23 February 2007\n| year = 2002\n| author = Ed Hayes\n| publisher = Open Democracy\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070109164930/http://www.opendemocracy.net/arts-Film/article_815.jsp\n| archivedate = 9 January 2007\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n==Film career==\n{{see also|Abbas Kiarostami filmography}}\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1970 when the [[Iranian New Wave]] began with [[Dariush Mehrjui]]'s film ''[[The Cow (1969 film)|G\u0101v]]'', Kiarostami helped set up a filmmaking department at the Institute for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults (Kanun) in Tehran. Its debut production, and Kiarostami's first film, was the twelve-minute ''[[The Bread and Alley]]'' (1970), a [[Neorealism (art)|neo-realistic]] short film about a schoolboy's confrontation with an aggressive dog. ''[[Breaktime]]'' followed in 1972. The department became one of Iran's most noted film studios, producing not only Kiarostami's films, but acclaimed Persian films such as ''[[The Runner (Davandeh)|The Runner]]'' and ''[[Bashu, the Little Stranger]]''.<ref name=\"AKzeitgeit\"/>\n\nIn the 1970s, Kiarostami pursued an [[individualism|individualistic]] style of film making.<ref name=\"AKStrictFS\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.filmref.com/journal2002.html\n |title       = Notes on Close Up \u2013 Iranian Cinema: Past, Present and Future\n |accessdate  = 23 February 2007\n|year        = 2002\n |author      = Hamid Dabashi\n |publisher   = Strictly Film School\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217181716/http://www.filmref.com/journal2002.html\n |archivedate = 17 February 2007\n|url-status     = dead\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> When discussing his first film, he stated:\n<blockquote>''Bread and Alley'' was my first experience in cinema and I must say a very difficult one. I had to work with a very young child, a dog, and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging and complaining all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.<ref name = \"AKSynoptique\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nFollowing ''[[The Experience (film)|The Experience]]'' (1973), Kiarostami released  ''[[The Traveler (1974 film)|The Traveler]]'' (''Mossafer'') in 1974. ''The Traveler'' tells the story of Qassem Julayi, a troubled and troublesome boy from a small Iranian city. Intent on attending a football match in far-off Tehran, he scams his friends and neighbors to raise money, and journeys to the stadium in time for the game, only to meet with an ironic twist of fate. In addressing the boy's determination to reach his goal, alongside his indifference to the effects of his amoral actions, the film examined human behavior and the balance of right and wrong. It furthered Kiarostami's reputation for [[Realism (dramatic arts)|realism]], [[Diegesis|diegetic]] simplicity, and stylistic complexity, as well as his fascination with physical and spiritual journeys.<ref name=\"BBCAKseason\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/festivals/abbas_kiarostami_2005.shtml\n| title = Abbas Kiarostami Season\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2005\n| author = David Parkinson\n| publisher = BBC\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Kiarostami directed two short films ''[[So Can I]]'' and ''[[Two Solutions for One Problem]]''.

It was not until his release of ''[[Where Is the Friend's Home?]]'' that he began to gain recognition outside Iran.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}These films created the basis of his later productions.\n\nThe film tells a simple account of a conscientious eight-year-old schoolboy's quest to return his friend's notebook in a neighboring village lest his friend be expelled from school. The traditional beliefs of Iranian rural people are portrayed. The film has been noted for its poetic use of the Iranian rural landscape and its realism, both important elements of Kiarostami's work.

The films also relate to the [[1990 Manjil\u2013Rudbar earthquake]], in which 40,000&nbsp;people died. Kiarostami uses the themes of life, death, change, and continuity to connect the films. The trilogy was successful in France in the 1990s and other Western European countries such as the [[Netherlands]], Sweden, Germany and [[Finland]].<ref name=\"AKBBC2005\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/festivals/abbas_kiarostami_2005.shtml\n| title = Abbas Kiarostami Season: National Film Theatre, 1st-31 May 2005\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2005\n| author = David Parkinson\n| publisher = BBC\n}}</ref> But, Kiarostami did not consider the three films to comprise a trilogy.

The family suspects theft as the motive for this charade, but the impersonator, Hossein Sabzian, argues that his motives were more complex.

While the cinematographer wanted separate shots of the boy approaching, a [[close-up]] of his hand as he enters the house and closes the door, followed by a shot of the dog, Kiarostami believed that if the three scenes could be captured as a whole it would have a more profound impact in creating tension over the situation. That one shot took around forty days to complete, until Kiarostami was fully content with the scene. Kiarostami later commented that the breaking of scenes would have disrupted the [[rhythm]] and content of the film's structure, preferring to let the scene flow as one.<ref name = \"AKSynoptique\"/>\n\nUnlike other directors, Kiarostami showed no interest in staging extravagant [[combat]] scenes or complicated chase scenes in large-scale productions, instead attempting to mold the medium of film to his own specifications.<ref name=\"IHFAkrami\"/> Kiarostami appeared to have settled on his style with the ''Koker trilogy'', which included a myriad of references to his own film material, connecting common themes and subject matter between each of the films. Stephen Bransford has contended that Kiarostami's films do not contain references to the work of other directors, but are fashioned in such a manner that they are self-referenced. Bransford believes his films are often fashioned into an ongoing dialectic with one film reflecting on and partially demystifying an earlier film.<ref name=\"SenseCinemaAK1\"/>\n\nHe continued experimenting with new modes of filming, using different directorial methods and techniques. A case in point is ''Ten'', which was filmed in a moving automobile in which Kiarostami was not present. He gave suggestions to the actors about what to do, and a camera placed on the [[dashboard]] filmed them while they drove around Tehran.<ref name=\"AKSynoptique\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.synoptique.ca/core/en/articles/kiarostami_interview\n| title = A Talk with the Artist: Abbas Kiarostami in Conversation\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2004\n| author = Shahin Parhami\n| publisher =Synoptique\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Liberty\">{{cite web\n| url =http://www.macalester.edu/weekly/120503/arts01.html\n| title =With liberty for all: the films of Kiarostami\n| accessdate=27 February 2007\n| year = 2003\n| author = Ben Sachs\n| work =The Mac Weekly\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060922072655/http://www.macalester.edu/weekly/120503/arts01.html | archivedate = 22 September 2006}}</ref> The camera was allowed to roll, capturing the faces of the people involved during their daily routine, using a series of extreme-close shots. ''Ten'' was an experiment that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. This new direction towards a ''[[Cinematic style of Abbas Kiarostami#Kiarostami and digital micro cinema|digital micro-cinema]]'' is defined as a micro-budget filmmaking practice, allied with a digital production basis.<ref>Ganz, A. & Khatib, L.

According to film professors such as Jamsheed Akrami of [[William Paterson University]], Kiarostami consistently tried to redefine film by forcing the increased involvement of the audience. In his later years, he also progressively trimmed the timespan within his films. Akrami thinks that this reduces the filmmaking from a collective endeavor to a purer, more basic form of artistic expression.<ref name=\"IHFAkrami\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.iranheritage.com/kiarostamiconference/abstracts_full.htm\n| title = Cooling Down a 'Hot Medium'\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2005\n| author = Jamsheed Akrami\n| publisher =Iran Heritage Foundation\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221105/http://www.iranheritage.com/kiarostamiconference/abstracts_full.htm\n| archivedate = 27 September 2007\n| url-status =dead\n}}</ref>\n\n===Fiction and non-fiction===\n[[File:Kiarostami & Bavi.jpg|thumb|Kiarostami interviewing with {{Interlanguage link multi|Habib Bavi|fa|3=\u062d\u0628\u06cc\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0648\u06cc \u0633\u0627\u062c\u062f}} in 2013]]\nKiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements ([[docufiction]]).

''Life and Nothing More...'', he argues, is neither representation nor reportage, but rather ''\"evidence\"'':\n<blockquote>[I]t all looks like reporting, but everything underscores (''indique \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence'') that it is the fiction of a documentary (in fact, Kiarostami shot the film several months after the earthquake), and that it is rather a document about \"fiction\": not in the sense of imagining the unreal, but in the very specific and precise sense of the technique, of the ''art'' of constructing images. For the image by means of which, each time, each opens a world and precedes himself in it (''s'y pr\u00e9c\u00e8de'') is not pregiven (''donn\u00e9e toute faite'') (as are those of dreams, phantasms or bad films): it is to be invented, cut and edited. Thus it is ''evidence'', insofar as, if one day I happen to ''look'' at my street on which I walk up and down ten times a day, I construct for an instant a new ''evidence'' of my street.<ref>Jean-Luc Nancy, \"On Evidence: ''Life and Nothing More'', by Abbas Kiarostami,\" ''Discourse'' 21.1 (1999), p.82. Also, cf., Jean Luc Nancy. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110611115020/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-luc-nancy/articles/is-cinema-renewing-itself/ Is Cinema Renewing Itself?] ''Film-Philosophy''. vol. 6 no. 15, July 2002.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor Jean-Luc Nancy, this notion of cinema as ''\"evidence\"'', rather than as documentary or imagination, is tied to the way Kiarostami deals with life-and-death (cf. the remark by Geoff Andrew on ''ABC Africa'', cited above, to the effect that Kiarostami's films are not about death but about life-and-death):\n<blockquote> Existence resists the indifference of life-and-death, it lives beyond mechanical \"life,\" it is always its own mourning, and its own joy. It becomes figure, image. It does not become alienated in images, but it is presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the objectivity of its assertion. This thought\u2014which, for me, is the very thought of this film [''Life and Nothing More...'']\u2014is a difficult thought, perhaps the most difficult. It's a slow thought, always under way, fraying a path so that the path itself becomes thought. It is that which frays images so that images become this thought, so that they become the evidence of this thought\u2014and not to \"represent\" it.<ref>Jean-Luc Nancy, \"On Evidence: ''Life and Nothing More'', by Abbas Kiarostami,\" ''Discourse'' 21.1 (1999), p.85\u20136.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn other words, wanting to accomplish more than just represent life and death as opposing forces, but rather to illustrate the way in which each element of nature is inextricably linked, Kiarostami devised a cinema that does more than just present the viewer with the documentable \"facts,\" but neither is it simply a matter of artifice. Because ''\"existence\"'' means more than simply life, it is projective, containing an irreducibly fictive element, but in this \"being more than\" life, it is therefore contaminated by mortality. Nancy is giving a clue, in other words, toward the interpretation of Kiarostami's statement that lying is the only way to truth.<ref>Jean-Luc Nancy, ''The Evidence of Film \u2013 Abbas Kiarostami'', Yves Gevaert, Belgium 2001, {{ISBN|2-930128-17-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Al-Ahram\">{{cite web\n |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/556/cu1.htm \n |title=Strategic lies \n |accessdate=23 February 2007 |year=2001 \n |author=Injy El-Kashef and Mohamed El-Assyouti \n |work=Al-Ahram Weekly \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217222234/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/556/cu1.htm \n |archivedate=17 February 2007 |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\n===Themes of life and death===\n[[File:Abbas Kiarostami & Paulo Branco at Estoril Film Festival 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Kiarostami (left) at the Estoril Film Festival in 2010]]\nThe concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami's works. In the ''Koker trilogy'', these themes play a central role. As illustrated in the aftermath of the [[1990 Manjil\u2013Rudbar earthquake]] disaster, they also represent the power of human resilience to overcome and defy destruction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/apr/28/hayfilmfestival2005.guardianhayfestival|title=Abbas Kiarostami|date=28 April 2005|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 August 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the Koker films, which convey an instinctual thirst for survival, ''[[Taste of Cherry]]'' explores the fragility of life and focuses on how precious it is.<ref name=\"CriterionAK\"/>\n\nSymbols of death abound in ''The Wind Will Carry Us,'' with the scenery of the graveyard, the imminence of the old woman's passing, and the ancestors referred to early in the film by the character Farzad. Such devices prompt the viewer to reflect on the [[parameter]]s of the afterlife and immaterial existence. The viewer is asked to consider what constitutes the soul, and what happens to it after death. In discussing the film, Kiarostami said that he is the person who raises questions, rather than answers them.<ref name=\"Beyond\">{{cite web\n| url = http://reverseshot.org/archive/entry/267/wind_will_carry_us\n| title = Beyond Borders\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2004\n| author = Michael J. Anderson\n| publisher = reverse shot\n}}</ref>\n\nSome film critics believe that the assemblage of light versus dark scenes in Kiarostami's film grammar, such as in ''Taste of Cherry'' and ''The Wind Will Carry Us'', suggests the mutual existence of life with its endless possibilities, and death as a factual moment of anyone's life.<ref name=\"Khatereh\">{{cite journal\n| title =Kiarostami and the Aesthetics of Modern Persian Poetry\n|journal = Iranian Studies|volume = 39|issue = 4|pages = 509\u2013537| year = 2006\n| author = Khatereh Sheibani\n| doi =10.1080/00210860601005088\n}}</ref><!--{{Cite journal}} should be used here-->\n\n===Visual and audio techniques===\nKiarostami's style is notable for the use of panoramic long shots, such as in the closing sequences of ''Life and Nothing More'' and ''Through the Olive Trees'', where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to stimulate reflection on their fate. ''Taste of Cherry'' is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is conversing with a passenger. However, the visual distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the sound of the dialog, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of a private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity can be seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.<ref name=\"ChicagoReaderAK\"/>\n\nThis relationship between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is also present in the opening sequence to ''The Wind Will Carry Us''. Michael J. Anderson has argued that such a [[Theme (arts)|thematic]] application of this central concept of ''presence without presence'', through using such techniques, and by often referring to characters which the viewer does not see and sometimes not hear directly affects the nature and concept of space in the [[Geography|geographical]] framework in which the world is portrayed. Kiarostami's use of sound and [[image]]ry conveys a world beyond what is directly visible and/or audible, which Anderson believes emphasizes the interconnectedness and shrinking of time and space in the modern world of telecommunications.<ref name=\"Beyond\"/>\n\nOther commentators such as [[Film criticism|film critic]] Ben Zipper believe that Kiarostami's work as a landscape artist is evident in his compositional distant shots of the dry hills throughout a number of his films directly impacting on his construction on the rural landscapes within his films.<ref name=\"Khatereh\"/>\n\n===Poetry and imagery===\n[[Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak]], of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], argues that one aspect of Kiarostami's cinematic style is that he is able to capture the essence of [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]] and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In several of his movies such as ''Where is the Friend's Home'' and ''The Wind Will Carry Us'', classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.<ref name=\"Hakkak-poetry\">Karimi-Hakkak, Ahmad. \"From Kinetic Poetics to a Poetic Cinema: Abbas Kiarostami and the Esthetics of Persian Poetry.\" University of Maryland (2005)</ref>\nThe characters recite poems mainly from classical Persian poet [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]] or modern Persian poets such as [[Sohrab Sepehri]] and [[Forough Farrokhzad]]. One scene in ''The Wind Will Carry Us'' has a long shot of a wheat field with rippling golden crops through which the doctor, accompanied by the filmmaker, is riding his scooter in a twisting road. In response to the comment that the other world is a better place than this one, the doctor recites this poem of Khayyam:<ref name=\"Khatereh\"/>\n\n<blockquote><poem>They promise of [[houri]]es in heaven\nBut I would say wine is better\nTake the present to the promises\nA drum sounds melodious from distance</poem></blockquote><!-- Whose translation of the poem is this? If it's Fitzgerald, maybe we should add another one that is more faithful to the original?-->\n\nHowever, the aesthetic element involved with the poetry goes much farther back in time and is used more subtly than these examples suggest. Beyond issues of adaptation of text to film, Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian poetry, both classical and modern. This prominently results in enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film.<ref name=\"Hakkak-poetry\"/>\n\nIt has been argued that the creative merit of Kiarostami's adaptation of Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad's poems extends the domain of textual transformation. Adaptation is defined as the transformation of a prior to a new text. Sima Daad of the [[University of Washington]] contends that Kiarostami's adaptation arrives at the theoretical realm of adaptation by expanding its limit from inter-textual potential to trans-generic potential.<ref name=\"SimaDaad\">{{cite web\n| url =http://www.iranheritage.com/kiarostamiconference/abstracts_full.htm\n| title =Adaption, Fidelity, and Transformation: Kiarostami and the Modernist Poetry of Iran\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2005\n| author = Sima Daad\n| publisher =Iran Heritage Foundation\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221105/http://www.iranheritage.com/kiarostamiconference/abstracts_full.htm\n| archivedate = 27 September 2007\n| url-status =dead\n}}</ref>\n\n===Spirituality===\nKiarostami's films often reflect upon immaterial concepts such as soul and afterlife. At times, however, the very concept of the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium. Some film theorists have argued that ''The Wind Will Carry Us'' provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] reality. The limits of the frame, the material representation of a space in dialog with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those which may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the ''[[mise en sc\u00e8ne]],'' Kiarostami expands the space of the art.<ref name=\"Beyond\"/>\n\nKiarostami's \"complex\" sound-images and philosophical approach have caused frequent comparisons with \"mystical\" filmmakers such as [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and [[Robert Bresson]]. While acknowledging substantial cultural differences, much of Western critical writing about Kiarostami positions him as the Iranian equivalent of such directors, by virtue of a similarly austere, \"spiritual\" poetics and moral commitment.<ref name=\"Hamish\">{{cite web\n| url =http://sensesofcinema.com/2006/book-reviews/cinema_kiarostami/\n| title =The Cinema of Abbas Kiarostami by Alberto Elena\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2005\n| author = Hamish Ford\n| publisher =Sense of Cinema\n}}</ref> Some draw parallels between certain imagery in Kiarostami's films with that of [[Sufi]] concepts.<ref name=\"Pak\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.iranheritage.org/kiarostamiconference/abstracts_full.htm#j\n| title = Religion and Spirituality in Kiarostami's Works\n| accessdate=23 February 2007\n| year = 2005\n| author = Nacim Pak\n| publisher = Iran Heritage Foundation\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221105/http://www.iranheritage.com/kiarostamiconference/abstracts_full.htm#j\n| archivedate = 27 September 2007\n| url-status =dead\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile most English-language writers, such as David Sterritt and the Spanish film professor Alberto Elena, interpret Kiarostami's films as spiritual, other critics, including [[David Walsh (writer)|David Walsh]] and Hamish Ford, have not rated its influence in his films as lower.<ref name=\"CriterionAK\"/><ref name=\"Hamish\"/><ref name=\"Pak\"/> <!-- What do they think instead? -->\n\n==Poetry, art and photography==\n[[File:7chenar A.K2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Installation art by Abbas Kiarostami]]\nKiarostami, along with [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Derek Jarman]] and [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], was a filmmaker who expressed himself in other genres, such as poetry, [[set design]]s, painting, or photography.

Camera placement, likewise, often defies standard audience expectations: in the closing sequences of ''Life and Nothing More'' and ''Through the Olive Trees'', the audience is forced to imagine the dialogue and circumstances of important scenes. In ''Homework'' and ''Close-Up'', parts of the soundtrack are masked or silenced. Critics have argued that the subtlety of Kiarostami's cinematic expression is largely resistant to critical analysis.<ref>[[Daniel Ross (philosopher)|Daniel Ross]], [http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/20/10.html Review of Geoff Andrew, ''Ten''.]</ref>\n\nWhile Kiarostami has won significant acclaim in Europe for several of his films, the Iranian government has refused to permit the screening of his films, to which he responded \"The government has decided not to show any of my films for the past 10 years...

Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and it is separated from [[Malm\u00f6]], Sweden, by the strait of [[\u00d8resund]]. The [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.\n\nOriginally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]], Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the [[Kalmar Union]], governing the entire present day [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] region in a personal union with Sweden and [[Norway]] ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of [[Scandinavia]] under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague outbreak]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in information technology, [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]], Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, [[Arres\u00f8]], lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]].\n\nCopenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Business School]] and the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC K\u00f8benhavn]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] football clubs. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Metro]], launched in 2002, serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-train]], the [[Lokaltog]] ([[:da:Privatbane|private railway]]) and the [[Coast Line (Denmark)|Coast Line]] network serve and connect central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, [[Copenhagen Airport]], Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the [[Nordic countries]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''Kaupmannah\u01ebfn''' [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Kaupmannah\u00f6fn'' [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Keypmannahavn''), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn''', with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]]. An exact English equivalent would be \"[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kj\u00f8benhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C. Gad|year=1877|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> However, the English term for the city was adapted from its [[Low German]] name, ''Kopenhagen''.\n(English ''chapman'', German ''Kaufmann'', Dutch ''koopman'', Swedish ''k\u00f6pman'', Danish ''k\u00f8bmand'', Icelandic ''kaupma\u00f0ur'': in all these words, the first syllable comes ultimately from Latin ''caupo'', \"tradesman\".) Copenhagen's Swedish name is ''K\u00f6penhamn'', a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Copenhagen|Timeline of Copenhagen}}\n[[File:K\u00f8benhavn1500.jpg|right|thumb|Reconstruction of Copenhagen {{circa|1500}}]]\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent [[archaeological]] finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's [[Kongens Nytorv]] from c. 1020. Excavations in [[Pilestr\u00e6de]] have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where [[Str\u00f8get]] meets [[R\u00e5dhuspladsen]].\n\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of [[flint]] tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/arkaeologer-graver-ny-teori-om-kobenhavn-op-af-mulden|title=Ark\u00e6ologer graver ny teori om K\u00f8benhavn op af mulden|publisher=Videnskab.dk|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=12 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Many historians believe the town dates to the late [[Viking Age]], and was possibly founded by [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn I Forkbeard]].{{sfn|Cunningham|2013|p=35}} \nThe natural harbour and good [[herring]] stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century.<ref name=khdsd>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie|title=K\u00f8benhavn \u2013 historie|website=Den Store Danske |access-date=12 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> The first habitations were probably centred on [[Gammel Strand]] (literally \"old shore\") in the 11th century or even earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|title=Gammel Strand|publisher=K\u00f8benhavns Museum|accessdate=24 November 2013|language=Danish|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131124104344/http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|archivedate=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in [[Gesta Danorum]] referred to it as ''Portus Mercatorum'', meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the [[Danish language|Danish]] of the time, ''K\u00f8bmannahavn''.<ref name=metro1415>Skaarup; Jensen (2002), pp. 14\u201315</ref> Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to [[Absalon|Bishop Absalon]]'s construction of a modest fortress on the little island of [[Slotsholmen]] in 1167 where [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands today.{{sfn|Davies|1944|p=365}} The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by [[Wends|Wendish]] pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built.

Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]], it was finally forced to capitulate to [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] supported by Dutch shipping. [[Christoffer Valkendorff]], a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development.<ref name=khdsd/> The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on [[Slotsholmen]]: the [[T\u00f8jhus Museum|T\u00f8jhus Arsenal]] and [[B\u00f8rsen]], the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the [[Danish East India Company|East India Company]] was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of [[Christianshavn]] with canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen.<ref name=kher>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie/K%c3%b8benhavn_(Historie_-_Efter_Reformationen)|title=K\u00f8benhavns historie efter Reformationen|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=14 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Christian IV also sponsored an array of ambitious building projects including [[Rosenborg Slot]] and the [[Rundet\u00e5rn]].{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} In 1658\u201359, the city withstood a siege by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] under [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X]] and successfully repelled [[Assault on Copenhagen (1659)|a major assault]].<ref name=kher/>\n\nBy 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway.

Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and it is separated from [[Malm\u00f6]], Sweden, by the strait of [[\u00d8resund]]. The [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.\n\nOriginally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]], Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the [[Kalmar Union]], governing the entire present day [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] region in a personal union with Sweden and [[Norway]] ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of [[Scandinavia]] under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague outbreak]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in information technology, [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]], Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, [[Arres\u00f8]], lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]].\n\nCopenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Business School]] and the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC K\u00f8benhavn]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] football clubs. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Metro]], launched in 2002, serves central Copenhagen.

The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''Kaupmannah\u01ebfn''' [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Kaupmannah\u00f6fn'' [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Keypmannahavn''), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn''', with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]]. An exact English equivalent would be \"[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kj\u00f8benhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C.

The first Embassy Suites hotel opened in 1984 in [[Overland Park, Kansas]]. In 1989, just 6 years after its founding, Embassy Suites was named one of Fortune's \"Best Companies for Customer Service.\" \n\nIn 1990, the parent company of Embassy Suites became The Promus Companies Incorporated.\n\nEmbassy Suites opened its first international property in 1992 in Toronto.\n\nIn 1999, Embassy Suites Hotels joined the Hilton Family after the merger of Hilton Hotels Corp. and Promus Hotel Corp. That same year, Embassy Suites was named \"Best Practice Corporate Champions in Quality\" by the Center for Hospitality Research at Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, and was the recipient of the J.D. Power and Associates \"Highest Guest Satisfaction among All-Suite Hotel Chains\" award. \n\nIn 2007, Embassy Suites reclaimed the J.D. Power and Associates award for \u201cHighest Guest Satisfaction among Upscale Hotel Brands,\u201d the brand\u2019s sixth overall win.\n\nEmbassy Suites celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2009 with the opening of Embassy Suites Minneapolis \u2013 Brooklyn Center. That same year, Embassy Suites won \u201cHighest Guest Satisfaction among Upscale Hotel Brands\u201d for a record-setting seventh time.\n\nIn 2014, Embassy Suites Santo Domingo opened, representing the brand\u2019s first hotel in the Dominican Republic. The following year, Embassy Suites re-branded to Embassy Suites by Hilton, and was ranked the #1 hotel brand for families in the category by Parents magazine.\n\n==Property features and amenities==\nEmbassy Suites is a chain of all-suite hotels. All guest rooms of this chain have a separate living area as well as a sleeping area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://embassysuites3.hilton.com/en/about/two-room-suites.html|title=Embassy Suites by Hilton - Two-Room Suite Hotels|website=embassysuites3.hilton.com|access-date=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of Embassy Suites hotels have an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]-style layout, although some Embassy Suites properties lack this feature.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn the evening, an ''Evening Reception'' with drinks and light snacks is provided for all guests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://embassysuites3.hilton.com/en/about/complimentary-evening-reception.html|title=Complimentary Drinks at Embassy Suites by Hilton|website=embassysuites3.hilton.com|access-date=August 1, 2019}}</ref> Embassy Suites properties also offer a complimentary breakfast featuring made-to-order omelets and other hot and cold options.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://embassysuites3.hilton.com/en/about/free-cooked-to-order-breakfast.html|title=Embassy Suites by Hilton - Free Cooked-to-Order Breakfast|website=embassysuites3.hilton.com|access-date=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe 2017 film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' filmed the Academic Decathlon scenes at the Hilton Atlanta Perimeter Center Embassy Suites.\n\n==Commercials==\nIn early 2011, Embassy Suites announced a series of three new 30-second commercials, to be aired in major markets beginning in March 2011.  The commercials feature the character 'Mr. More' and are directed by [[Roman Coppola]].

It is the most westerly municipality in Germany since 1919; until then, the title had been held by [[Gravelotte]], in [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. Selfkant's border with the Netherlands is 27 km long, but the border with the rest of Germany is only 6 km long.\n\n==History==\nThe most important domain in Selfkant in the Middle Ages was the castle and village of [[Millen (Germany)|Millen]], the residence of the lords of Millen, which became part of the domain Heinsberg in 1282. In 1499 these were joined by the [[duchy of J\u00fclich|duke of J\u00fclich]] and Millen became the seat of an ''[[Amtmann]]''. The places T\u00fcddern, Wehr, S\u00fcsterseel and Hillensberg belonged to the ''Amt'' [[Born (Netherlands)|Born]] and after 1709 to the ''Amt'' [[Sittard]].\n\nFrom 1794 to 1815 Selfkant was part of the French canton Sittard (department of the [[Roer (department)|Roer]]). After the [[Congress of Vienna]] it became part of the [[Prussia]]n Rhine province. The border with the Netherlands which was then fixed continued to exist until shortly after the Second World War.\n\n===T\u00fcddern===\nAfter the Second World War, on 23 April 1949, the Netherlands [[Dutch annexation of German territory after the Second World War|annexed]] Selfkant as part of war reparations, and its inhabitants were given a Dutch passport with the special indication \"to be treated as a Dutchman\". The Dutch government appointed a country ''[[Landdrost#Post-World War II Dutch-occupied Germany|landdrost]]'' to head the governing board of the T\u00fcddern 'office', as the Selfkant was renamed for administrative purposes. The governing board appointed by the Germans was sent home because it was contrary to the Dutch constitution. However, as a transitional measure for ex-German territories, the German governing board retained an advisory role.\n\nAt that time much was invested in such things as houses and roads. Parts of the area became [[Dutch annexation of German territory after World War II|Dutchified]], and the [[Batavianization|Dutch]] influence is still present.\n\nIn the Dutch period, the N274 road was built to provide a direct link between [[Roermond]] and [[Heerlen]]. Even after 1963 the road remained a narrow strip or corridor of Dutch territory with no junctions with German roads, and no passport was needed to use it. On 25 February 2002 the road was returned to Germany and in the course of 2004 connections were made with several roads, among others with the B56 between [[Gangelt]] and S\u00fcsterseel.\n\n===German municipality===\nIn March 1957 official negotiations started between the Netherlands and [[West Germany]] concerning the return of the area, and on 1 August 1963 the area was returned to Germany in exchange for a payment of 280 million deutschmarks. From the existing 'office' of T\u00fcddern the old municipalities of Havert, Hillensberg, H\u00f6ngen, Millen, S\u00fcsterseel, T\u00fcddern and Wehr were formed. Two months later, on 21 October 1963, the first municipal council elections under German authority were held.\n\nThe seven municipalities, with the municipality of Saeffelen from the Amt [[Waldfeucht]], were added to the municipality Selfkant on 1 July 1969.\n\nWith 233 inhabitants per km\u00b2 Selfkant is considered a rural municipality. Because of the favourable price of land the municipality is nowadays very much in demand with young families. A lot of Dutch cross the border to build their own houses there. Roughly one quarter to one half of the inhabitants are Dutch. At the mayoral election of 2003 a Dutch inhabitant put himself forward as candidate.\n\nMany residents are also stationed, work, or are family members of employees at the [[NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen|NATO Air Base in Geilenkirchen]]. T\u00fcddern alone has over 30 American families with the Gem. Selkant having dozens more. Many Canadians at the NATO base also live in Selfkant.

Born in [[Chislehurst]], England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began [[Zen]] training in New York. He received a master's degree in [[theology]] from [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]] and became an [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] priest in 1945.

He wrote more than 25 books and articles on religion and philosophy, introducing the emerging [[Counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] to ''[[The Way of Zen]]'' (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In ''Psychotherapy East and West'' (1961), he argued that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of [[psychotherapy]]. He considered ''Nature, Man and Woman'' (1958) to be, \"from a literary point of view\u2014the best book I have ever written.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |year=1973 |title=In My Own Way: An Autobiography 1915\u20131965 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York |page=280}}</ref> He also explored human consciousness and [[psychedelic]]s in works such as \"The New Alchemy\" (1958) and ''The Joyous Cosmology'' (1962).\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Alan Watts age7.JPG|thumb|upright|Watts aged 7]]\n\nWatts was born to middle-class parents in the village of [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]] (now south-east London), on 6 January 1915, living at 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane, which was previously lived in by author [[John Hemming-Clark]] in the early 1900s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.johnhemmingclark.com/media|title=Media}}</ref> Watts' father, Laurence Wilson Watts, was a representative for the London office of the [[Michelin]] tyre company. His mother, Emily Mary Watts (n\u00e9e Buchan), was a housewife whose father had been a [[missionary]]. With modest financial means, they chose to live in pastoral surroundings and Watts, an only child, grew up playing at Brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and butterflies.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, Part 1</ref> Probably because of the influence of his mother's religious family<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 12.</ref> the Buchans, an interest in \"ultimate things\" seeped in. It mixed with Watts's own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East.<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 22</ref>\n\nWatts also later wrote of a [[mystical]] dream he experienced while ill with a fever as a child.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 322</ref> During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote \"I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> These works of art emphasised the participatory relationship of people in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life and one that he often wrote about. (See, for instance, the last chapter in ''[[The Way of Zen]]''.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1957, Part 2, Chapter 4</ref>)\n\n===Buddhism===\n\nBy his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to [[boarding school]]s (which included both academic and religious training of the \"[[Muscular Christianity|Muscular Christian]]\" sort) from early years. Of this religious training, he remarked \"Throughout my schooling my religious indoctrination was grim and maudlin.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 60</ref>\n\nWatts spent several holidays in [[France]] in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] with strong interests in both [[Buddhism]] and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It was not long afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the [[Anglican]] Christianity he had been exposed to and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the [[London Buddhist Lodge]], which had been established by [[Theosophism|Theosophists]], and was then run by the barrister [[Christmas Humphreys]]. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of [[meditation]] during these years.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Education===\n\nWatts attended [[The King's School, Canterbury]], next door to [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a [[scholarship]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that was read as \"presumptuous and capricious.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 102</ref>\n\nWhen he left secondary school, Watts worked in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the [[Buddhist Society|Buddhist Lodge]] and also under the tutelage of a \"rascal guru\" named [[Dimitrije Mitrinovi\u0107]]. (Mitrinovi\u0107 was himself influenced by [[P. D. Ouspensky|Peter Demianovich Ouspensky]], [[George Gurdjieff|G. I. Gurdjieff]], and the varied psychoanalytical schools of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Alfred Adler|Adler]].) Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom.\n\nBy his own reckoning, and also by that of his biographer [[Monica Furlong]], Watts was primarily an [[autodidact]]. His involvement with the Buddhist Lodge in London afforded Watts a considerable number of opportunities for [[personal growth]]. Through Humphreys, he contacted eminent spiritual authors, e.g. the artist, scholar, and mystic [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]], and prominent theosophists like [[Alice Bailey]].\n\nIn 1936, aged 21, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the [[University of London]], heard [[D.&nbsp;T. Suzuki]] read a paper, and afterwards was able to meet this esteemed scholar of [[Zen Buddhism]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 78\u201382</ref> Beyond these discussions and personal encounters, Watts absorbed, by studying the available scholarly literature, the fundamental [[concept]]s and [[terminology]] of the main philosophies of India and [[East Asia]].\n\n===Influences and first publication===\nWatts's fascination with the [[Zen]] (or Ch'an) tradition\u2014beginning during the 1930s\u2014developed because that tradition embodied the spiritual, interwoven with the practical, as exemplified in the subtitle of his ''Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art in the Far East''. \"Work\", \"life\", and \"art\" were not demoted due to a spiritual focus. In his writing, he referred to it as \"the great Ch'an (or Zen) synthesis of [[Taoism]], Confucianism and Buddhism after AD 700 in China.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971 ''Behold the Spirit'', revised edition. New York: Random House / Vintage. p. 32</ref> Watts published his first book, ''The Spirit of Zen,'' in 1936. Two decades later, in ''The Way of Zen''<ref>Watts, Alan W., 1957, p.11</ref> he disparaged ''The Spirit of Zen'' as a \"popularisation of Suzuki's earlier works, and besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and misleading.\"\n\nWatts married Eleanor Everett, whose mother [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki|Ruth Fuller Everett]] was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in New York. Ruth Fuller later married the Zen master (or \"roshi\"), [[Sokei-an Sasaki]], who served as a sort of model and mentor to Watts, though he chose not to enter into a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife. In 1938 they left England to live in the United States. Watts became a United States citizen in 1943.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alan Wilson Watts |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Alan_Watts.aspx |publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography}}</ref>\n\n===Christian priest and afterwards===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\nWatts left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher did not suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a vocational outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]], an Episcopal (Anglican) school in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master's degree in theology in response to his thesis, which he published as a popular edition under the title ''[[Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion]]''.\n\nHe later published ''Myth & Ritual in Christianity'' (1953), an [[eisegesis]] of traditional [[Roman Catholic]] doctrine and ritual in Buddhist terms. However, the pattern was set, in that Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing\u2014no matter if they were found within [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], or [[Buddhism]].\n\nAs recounted in his autobiography, Alan was [[Holy orders|ordained]] as an [[Episcopal priest]] in 1945 (aged 30) and resigned the ministry by 1950, partly as a result of an extramarital affair which resulted in his wife having their marriage annulled, but also because he could no longer reconcile his Buddhist beliefs with the formal doctrine of the church. He spent the New Year getting to know [[Joseph Campbell]] and Campbell's wife, [[Jean Erdman]], as well as the composer [[John Cage]].\n\nIn early 1951, Watts moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in [[San Francisco]]. Here he taught from 1951 to 1957 alongside Sabur\u014d Hasegawa (1906\u20131957), [[Frederic Spiegelberg]], [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], [[lama]] Tada T\u014dkan (1890\u20131967), and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa, in particular, served as a teacher to Watts in the areas of Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature. It was during this time he met the poet, [[Jean Burden]] with whom he had a four-year love affair.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-16/news/ga-6607_1_jean-burden/2|title=She's Well-Versed in the Art of Writing Well : Poetry: Author, editor and teacher Jean Burden shares her lifelong obsession through invitation-only workshops in her home. |last=Hudson |first=Berkley |date=1992-08-16 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n\nAlan credited her as an \"important influence\" in his life and gave her dedicatory cryptograph in his book \"Nature, Man and Woman\", to which he alludes in his autobiography (p.&nbsp;297). Besides teaching, Watts served for several years as the Academy's administrator. One notable student of his was [[Eugene Rose]], who later went on to become a noted [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[hieromonk]] and controversial [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|theologian]] within the Orthodox Church in America under the jurisdiction of [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]]. Rose's own disciple, a fellow monastic priest published under the name Hieromonk Damascene, produced a book entitled ''Christ the Eternal Tao'', in which the author [[comparative religion|draws parallels]] between the concept of the Tao in Chinese philosophy and the concept of the ''[[Logos]]'' in classical Greek philosophy and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] theology.\n\nWatts also studied written Chinese and practiced Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with some of the Chinese students who enrolled at the academy. While Watts was noted for an interest in [[Zen Buddhism]], his reading and discussions delved into [[Vedanta]], \"[[quantum physics|the new physics]]\", [[cybernetics]], [[semantics]], [[process philosophy]], [[natural history]], and the [[anthropology]] of sexuality.\n\n==Middle years==\nWatts left the faculty for a career in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station [[KPFA]] in Berkeley. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts. These weekly broadcasts continued until 1962, by which time he had attracted a \"legion of regular listeners\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/kpfafolio131paci ''KPFA Folio'', Volume 13, no. 1], 9\u201322 April 1962, p. 14.

These recordings are broadcast to this day. For example, in 1970 Watts lectures were broadcast on Sunday mornings on San Francisco radio station KSAN;<ref>Susan Krieger, ''Hip Capitalism'', 1979, Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, {{ISBN|0-8039-1263-3}} pbk., p. 170.</ref> and even today a number of radio stations continue to have an Alan Watts program in their weekly program schedules.<ref>[http://kkup.org/sched/weekly.html KKUP Program Schedule] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510063805/http://www.kkup.org/sched/weekly.html |date=10 May 2016 }}.

Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen in India and China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from [[general semantics]] (directly from the writings of [[Alfred Korzybski]]) and also from [[Norbert Wiener]]'s early work on [[cybernetics]], which had recently been published. Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.\n\nIn 1958, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] and the German psychotherapist [[Karlfried Graf D\u00fcrckheim]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 321.</ref>\n\nUpon returning to the United States, Watts recorded two seasons of a television series (1959\u20131960) for [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] public television in San Francisco, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life\".<ref>Alan Watts, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life, [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL772D292429735309 Season 1 (1959)\"] and [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1C3BAC2EB58EE47 Season 2 (1960)], KQED public television series, San Francisco</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Watts became interested in how identifiable patterns in nature tend to repeat themselves from the smallest of scales to the most immense. This became one of his passions in his research and thought.<ref>Ropp, Robert S. de 1995, 2002 ''Warrior's Way: a Twentieth Century Odyssey''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, pp. 333\u2013334.</ref>\n\nThough never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he was Professor of Comparative Philosophy at the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]] (as mentioned above), had a fellowship at [[Harvard University]] (1962\u20131964), and was a Scholar at [[San Jose State University]] (1968).<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan Watts - Life and Works|url=http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|access-date=25 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802050948/http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|archive-date=2 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also lectured college and university students as well as the general public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deoxy Org: Alan Watts|url=http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819233823/http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|archivedate=19 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His lectures and books gave him influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s\u20131970s, but he was often seen as an outsider in academia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weidenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=Complaining about Alan Watts|url=https://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140803085526/http://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|url-status = dead|archive-date=2014-08-03}}</ref> When questioned sharply by students during his talk at [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], in 1970, Watts responded, as he had from the early sixties, that he was not an academic philosopher but rather \"a philosophical entertainer\".<ref name=\"NR\" />\n\n===Experimentation===\n\nSome of Watts' writings published in 1958 (e.g., his book ''Nature, Man and Woman'' and his essay \"The New Alchemy\") mentioned some of his early views on the use of psychedelic drugs for mystical insight. Watts had begun to experiment with psychedelics, initially with [[mescaline]] given to him by [[Oscar Janiger]]. He tried [[LSD]] several times in 1958, with various research teams led by Keith S. Ditman, Sterling Bunnell Jr., and Michael Agron. He also tried [[marijuana]] and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts' books of the '60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook.<ref name=\"Joyous 26\">''The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness'' (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book).</ref>\n\nHe later said about psychedelic drug use, \"If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.\"<ref name=\"Joyous 26\"/>\n\nFor a time, Watts came to prefer writing in the language of modern science and psychology (such as ''Psychotherapy East and West''), finding a parallel between mystical experiences and the theories of the material universe proposed by 20th-century physicists. He later equated mystical experience with ecological awareness, and typically emphasized whichever approach seemed best suited to the audience he was addressing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Applied aesthetics===\n\nWatts sometimes ate with his group of neighbors in [[Druid Heights]] (near [[Mill Valley]], California) who had endeavored to combine architecture, gardening, and carpentry skills to make a beautiful and comfortable life for themselves. These neighbors accomplished this by relying on their own talents and using their own hands, as they lived in what has been called \"shared bohemian poverty\".<ref>^ Davis, Erik (May 2005).

He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of [[aesthetics]] (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, \"\u2026 cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix\".<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 247.</ref>\n\nIn his last novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), Huxley mentions the religious practice of [[maithuna]] as being something like that which [[Roman Catholics]] call \"''[[coitus reservatus]]''\". A few years before, Watts had discussed the theme in his own book, ''Nature, Man and Woman'', in which he discusses the possibility of the practice being known to early Christians and of it being kept secretly by the Church.\n\n==Later years==\n\nIn his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of [[Ch\u00e1n]] (Zen) in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages. In his mature work, he presents himself as \"Zennist\" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him.\n\nThough known for his discourses on Zen, he was also influenced by ancient Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta. He spoke extensively about the nature of the divine reality which Man misses: how the contradiction of opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human evolution, how our fundamental Ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature of mind and ego, how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and Light, and other cosmic principles. These are discussed in great detail in dozens of hours of audio that are in part captured in the 'Out of Your Mind' series.\n\nWatts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic comments on love relationships in \"Divine Madness\" and on perception of the organism-environment in \"The Philosophy of Nature\". In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures.\n\nWatts also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament. Writing, for example, in the early 1960s: \"Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin\u2014especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?\"<ref>''The Joyous Cosmology'', p. 63</ref> These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for [[National Educational Television|NET]] (National Educational Television) filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.\n\n==Death==\n\nIn October 1973, Watts returned from a European lecture tour to his cabin in [[Druid Heights]], California. Friends of Watts had been concerned about him for some time over his [[alcoholism]].<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\"/><ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\"/> On 16 November 1973, at age 58, he died in his sleep.

He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.\n\nHe often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.\n\nWatts led some tours for Westerners to the Buddhist temples of Japan. He also studied some movements from the traditional [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial]] art [[taijiquan]], with an Asian colleague, [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]].\n\n===Worldview===\n\nIn several of his later publications, especially ''Beyond Theology'' and ''The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'', Watts put forward a [[worldview]], drawing on [[Hinduism]], [[Chinese philosophy]], [[pantheism]] or [[panentheism]], and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic Self playing hide-and-seek ([[Lila (Hinduism)|Lila]]); hiding from itself ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe and forgetting what it really is \u2013 the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an \"[[ego (spirituality)|ego]] in a bag of skin,\" or \"skin-encapsulated ego\" is a [[myth]]; the entities we call the separate \"things\" are merely aspects or features of the whole.\n\nWatts' books frequently include discussions reflecting his keen interest in patterns that occur in nature and which are repeated in various ways and at a wide range of scales \u2013 including the patterns to be discerned in the history of civilizations.<ref>De Ropp, Robert S. 2002 ''Warrior's Way''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, p. 334.</ref><ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971, pp. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Supporters and critics===\n\nWatts's explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the [[human potential movement]]. His friendship with poet [[Gary Snyder]] nurtured his sympathies with the budding [[environmental movement]], to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who credited Watts with being one of his \"Light[s] along the Way\" in the opening appreciation of ''[[Cosmic Trigger]]''. [[Werner Erhard]] attended workshops given by Alan Watts and said of him, \"He pointed me toward what I now call the distinction between Self and Mind. After my encounter with Alan, the context in which I was working shifted.\"<ref>William Warren Bartley, Werner Erhard, The Transformation of a Man</ref>\n\nWatts has been criticized by Buddhists such as [[Philip Kapleau]] and [[D. T. Suzuki]] for allegedly misinterpreting several key Zen Buddhist concepts. In particular, he drew criticism from those who believe that [[zazen]] must entail a strict and specific means of sitting, as opposed to a cultivated state of mind available at any moment in any situation. Typical of these is Kapleau's claim that Watts dismissed [[zazen]] on the basis of only half a [[koan]].<ref>Kapleau 1967, pp. 21\u201322</ref>\n\nIn regard to the aforementioned koan, [[Robert Baker Aitken]] reports that Suzuki told him, \"I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story.\"<ref>[[#refAitken|Aitken 1997]], p. 30. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SS-Dc6ox4hYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22original+dwelling+place%22#PPA29,M1]</ref> In his talks, Watts addressed the issue of defining zazen practice by saying, \"A cat sits until it is tired of sitting, then gets up, stretches, and walks away\", and referring<ref>Alan Watts: ''The truth of the birthless mind'', from ''Out of You Mind'', Session 8, Lecture 8.</ref> to  Zen master [[Bankei]]: \"Even when you're sitting in meditation, if there's something you've got to do, it's quite all right to get up and leave\".<ref>Peter Haskel (ed.): ''Bankei Zen: Translations from The Record of Bankei''. Grove Press, New York 1984. Page 59.</ref> \n\nHowever, Watts did have his supporters in the Zen community, including [[Shunryu Suzuki]], the founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]]. As [[David Chadwick (writer)|David Chadwick]] recounted in his biography of Suzuki, ''Crooked Cucumber: the Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', when a student of Suzuki's disparaged Watts by saying \"we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing\", Suzuki fumed with a sudden intensity, saying, \"You completely miss the point about Alan Watts! You should notice what he has done. He is a great [[bodhisattva]].\"<ref>Chadwick, D: ''Crooked Cucumber: The Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', Broadway Books,2000</ref>\n\nWatts's biographers saw him, after his stint as an Anglican priest, as representative of no religion but as a lone-wolf thinker and social rascal. In David Stuart's warts-and-all biography of the man, Watts is seen as an unusually gifted speaker and writer driven by his own interests, enthusiasms, and demons.<ref>Stuart, David 1976 ''Alan Watts''. Pennsylvania: Chilton.</ref> Elsa Gidlow, whom Alan called \"sister\", refused to be interviewed for this work but later painted a kinder picture of Alan's life in her own autobiography, ''Elsa, I Come With My Songs''. According to critic [[Erik Davis]], his \"writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=David |first=Erik |authorlink=Erik Davis |year=2006 |title=The Visionary State: A Journey through California's Spiritual Landscape |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=0-8118-4835-3}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nWatts married three times and had seven children (five daughters and two sons). \nWatts met Eleanor Everett in 1936, when her mother, Ruth Fuller Everett, brought her to London to study piano. They met at the Buddhist Lodge, were engaged the following year and married in April 1938. A daughter, Joan, was born in November 1938 and another, Anne, was born in 1942. Their marriage ended in 1949, but Watts continued to correspond with his former mother-in-law.<ref>Stirling 2006, p. 27</ref>\nIn 1950, Watts married Dorothy DeWitt. He moved to San Francisco in early 1951 to teach. They began a family that grew to include five children: Tia, Mark, Richard, Lila, and Diane. The couple separated in the early 1960s after Watts met Mary Jane Yates King (called \"Jano\" in his circle) while lecturing in New York. After a difficult divorce he married King in 1964. The couple divided their time between [[Sausalito, California]],<ref>''The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'' (1966)</ref> where they lived on a [[houseboat]] called the ''[[Vallejo (ferry)|Vallejo]]'',<ref>Watts, Alan, 1973, pp. 300\u2013304</ref> and a secluded cabin in [[Druid Heights]], on the southwest flank of [[Mount Tamalpais]] north of San Francisco.\nSome regard Watts as having been an unfaithful husband and a poor father.<ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\">{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@julesevans/alan-watts-genius-or-charlatan-72313fae997d|title=Alan Watts: genius or charlatan?|last=Evans |first=Jules |date=2019-02-01|website=Medium |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\">{{Cite web |url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/alan-watts-reconsidered/ |title=Alan Watts Reconsidered |last=Guy |first=David |website=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWatts' eldest daughters, Joan and Anne, own and manage most of the copyrights to his books.

Born in [[Chislehurst]], England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began [[Zen]] training in New York. He received a master's degree in [[theology]] from [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]] and became an [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] priest in 1945. He left the ministry in 1950 and moved to [[California]], where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]].<ref>James Craig Holte ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kWJoPT3zBK0C&pg=PA199&dq=Alan+Watts+american+citizen&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DGAiUfOLHZCoqQGtkYDwBQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Alan%20Watts%20american%20citizen&f=false The Conversion Experience in America: A 'Sourcebook on American Religious Conversion Autobiography]'' page 199</ref>\n\nWatts gained a following while working as a volunteer programmer at the [[KPFA]] radio station in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. He wrote more than 25 books and articles on religion and philosophy, introducing the emerging [[Counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] to ''[[The Way of Zen]]'' (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In ''Psychotherapy East and West'' (1961), he argued that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of [[psychotherapy]]. He considered ''Nature, Man and Woman'' (1958) to be, \"from a literary point of view\u2014the best book I have ever written.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |year=1973 |title=In My Own Way: An Autobiography 1915\u20131965 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York |page=280}}</ref> He also explored human consciousness and [[psychedelic]]s in works such as \"The New Alchemy\" (1958) and ''The Joyous Cosmology'' (1962).\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Alan Watts age7.JPG|thumb|upright|Watts aged 7]]\n\nWatts was born to middle-class parents in the village of [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]] (now south-east London), on 6 January 1915, living at 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane, which was previously lived in by author [[John Hemming-Clark]] in the early 1900s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.johnhemmingclark.com/media|title=Media}}</ref> Watts' father, Laurence Wilson Watts, was a representative for the London office of the [[Michelin]] tyre company.

With modest financial means, they chose to live in pastoral surroundings and Watts, an only child, grew up playing at Brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and butterflies.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, Part 1</ref> Probably because of the influence of his mother's religious family<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 12.</ref> the Buchans, an interest in \"ultimate things\" seeped in. It mixed with Watts's own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East.<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 22</ref>\n\nWatts also later wrote of a [[mystical]] dream he experienced while ill with a fever as a child.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 322</ref> During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote \"I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> These works of art emphasised the participatory relationship of people in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life and one that he often wrote about. (See, for instance, the last chapter in ''[[The Way of Zen]]''.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1957, Part 2, Chapter 4</ref>)\n\n===Buddhism===\n\nBy his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to [[boarding school]]s (which included both academic and religious training of the \"[[Muscular Christianity|Muscular Christian]]\" sort) from early years. Of this religious training, he remarked \"Throughout my schooling my religious indoctrination was grim and maudlin.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 60</ref>\n\nWatts spent several holidays in [[France]] in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] with strong interests in both [[Buddhism]] and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It was not long afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the [[Anglican]] Christianity he had been exposed to and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the [[London Buddhist Lodge]], which had been established by [[Theosophism|Theosophists]], and was then run by the barrister [[Christmas Humphreys]]. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of [[meditation]] during these years.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Education===\n\nWatts attended [[The King's School, Canterbury]], next door to [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a [[scholarship]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that was read as \"presumptuous and capricious.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 102</ref>\n\nWhen he left secondary school, Watts worked in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the [[Buddhist Society|Buddhist Lodge]] and also under the tutelage of a \"rascal guru\" named [[Dimitrije Mitrinovi\u0107]]. (Mitrinovi\u0107 was himself influenced by [[P. D. Ouspensky|Peter Demianovich Ouspensky]], [[George Gurdjieff|G. I. Gurdjieff]], and the varied psychoanalytical schools of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Alfred Adler|Adler]].) Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom.\n\nBy his own reckoning, and also by that of his biographer [[Monica Furlong]], Watts was primarily an [[autodidact]]. His involvement with the Buddhist Lodge in London afforded Watts a considerable number of opportunities for [[personal growth]]. Through Humphreys, he contacted eminent spiritual authors, e.g. the artist, scholar, and mystic [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]], and prominent theosophists like [[Alice Bailey]].\n\nIn 1936, aged 21, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the [[University of London]], heard [[D.&nbsp;T. Suzuki]] read a paper, and afterwards was able to meet this esteemed scholar of [[Zen Buddhism]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 78\u201382</ref> Beyond these discussions and personal encounters, Watts absorbed, by studying the available scholarly literature, the fundamental [[concept]]s and [[terminology]] of the main philosophies of India and [[East Asia]].\n\n===Influences and first publication===\nWatts's fascination with the [[Zen]] (or Ch'an) tradition\u2014beginning during the 1930s\u2014developed because that tradition embodied the spiritual, interwoven with the practical, as exemplified in the subtitle of his ''Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art in the Far East''. \"Work\", \"life\", and \"art\" were not demoted due to a spiritual focus. In his writing, he referred to it as \"the great Ch'an (or Zen) synthesis of [[Taoism]], Confucianism and Buddhism after AD 700 in China.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971 ''Behold the Spirit'', revised edition. New York: Random House / Vintage. p. 32</ref> Watts published his first book, ''The Spirit of Zen,'' in 1936. Two decades later, in ''The Way of Zen''<ref>Watts, Alan W., 1957, p.11</ref> he disparaged ''The Spirit of Zen'' as a \"popularisation of Suzuki's earlier works, and besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and misleading.\"\n\nWatts married Eleanor Everett, whose mother [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki|Ruth Fuller Everett]] was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in New York. Ruth Fuller later married the Zen master (or \"roshi\"), [[Sokei-an Sasaki]], who served as a sort of model and mentor to Watts, though he chose not to enter into a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife. In 1938 they left England to live in the United States. Watts became a United States citizen in 1943.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alan Wilson Watts |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Alan_Watts.aspx |publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography}}</ref>\n\n===Christian priest and afterwards===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\nWatts left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher did not suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a vocational outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]], an Episcopal (Anglican) school in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master's degree in theology in response to his thesis, which he published as a popular edition under the title ''[[Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion]]''.\n\nHe later published ''Myth & Ritual in Christianity'' (1953), an [[eisegesis]] of traditional [[Roman Catholic]] doctrine and ritual in Buddhist terms. However, the pattern was set, in that Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing\u2014no matter if they were found within [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], or [[Buddhism]].\n\nAs recounted in his autobiography, Alan was [[Holy orders|ordained]] as an [[Episcopal priest]] in 1945 (aged 30) and resigned the ministry by 1950, partly as a result of an extramarital affair which resulted in his wife having their marriage annulled, but also because he could no longer reconcile his Buddhist beliefs with the formal doctrine of the church. He spent the New Year getting to know [[Joseph Campbell]] and Campbell's wife, [[Jean Erdman]], as well as the composer [[John Cage]].\n\nIn early 1951, Watts moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in [[San Francisco]]. Here he taught from 1951 to 1957 alongside Sabur\u014d Hasegawa (1906\u20131957), [[Frederic Spiegelberg]], [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], [[lama]] Tada T\u014dkan (1890\u20131967), and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa, in particular, served as a teacher to Watts in the areas of Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature. It was during this time he met the poet, [[Jean Burden]] with whom he had a four-year love affair.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-16/news/ga-6607_1_jean-burden/2|title=She's Well-Versed in the Art of Writing Well : Poetry: Author, editor and teacher Jean Burden shares her lifelong obsession through invitation-only workshops in her home. |last=Hudson |first=Berkley |date=1992-08-16 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n\nAlan credited her as an \"important influence\" in his life and gave her dedicatory cryptograph in his book \"Nature, Man and Woman\", to which he alludes in his autobiography (p.&nbsp;297). Besides teaching, Watts served for several years as the Academy's administrator. One notable student of his was [[Eugene Rose]], who later went on to become a noted [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[hieromonk]] and controversial [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|theologian]] within the Orthodox Church in America under the jurisdiction of [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]]. Rose's own disciple, a fellow monastic priest published under the name Hieromonk Damascene, produced a book entitled ''Christ the Eternal Tao'', in which the author [[comparative religion|draws parallels]] between the concept of the Tao in Chinese philosophy and the concept of the ''[[Logos]]'' in classical Greek philosophy and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] theology.\n\nWatts also studied written Chinese and practiced Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with some of the Chinese students who enrolled at the academy. While Watts was noted for an interest in [[Zen Buddhism]], his reading and discussions delved into [[Vedanta]], \"[[quantum physics|the new physics]]\", [[cybernetics]], [[semantics]], [[process philosophy]], [[natural history]], and the [[anthropology]] of sexuality.\n\n==Middle years==\nWatts left the faculty for a career in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station [[KPFA]] in Berkeley. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts. These weekly broadcasts continued until 1962, by which time he had attracted a \"legion of regular listeners\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/kpfafolio131paci ''KPFA Folio'', Volume 13, no. 1], 9\u201322 April 1962, p. 14.

These recordings are broadcast to this day. For example, in 1970 Watts lectures were broadcast on Sunday mornings on San Francisco radio station KSAN;<ref>Susan Krieger, ''Hip Capitalism'', 1979, Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, {{ISBN|0-8039-1263-3}} pbk., p. 170.</ref> and even today a number of radio stations continue to have an Alan Watts program in their weekly program schedules.<ref>[http://kkup.org/sched/weekly.html KKUP Program Schedule] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510063805/http://www.kkup.org/sched/weekly.html |date=10 May 2016 }}.

Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen in India and China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from [[general semantics]] (directly from the writings of [[Alfred Korzybski]]) and also from [[Norbert Wiener]]'s early work on [[cybernetics]], which had recently been published. Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.\n\nIn 1958, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] and the German psychotherapist [[Karlfried Graf D\u00fcrckheim]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 321.</ref>\n\nUpon returning to the United States, Watts recorded two seasons of a television series (1959\u20131960) for [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] public television in San Francisco, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life\".<ref>Alan Watts, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life, [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL772D292429735309 Season 1 (1959)\"] and [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1C3BAC2EB58EE47 Season 2 (1960)], KQED public television series, San Francisco</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Watts became interested in how identifiable patterns in nature tend to repeat themselves from the smallest of scales to the most immense. This became one of his passions in his research and thought.<ref>Ropp, Robert S. de 1995, 2002 ''Warrior's Way: a Twentieth Century Odyssey''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, pp. 333\u2013334.</ref>\n\nThough never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he was Professor of Comparative Philosophy at the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]] (as mentioned above), had a fellowship at [[Harvard University]] (1962\u20131964), and was a Scholar at [[San Jose State University]] (1968).<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan Watts - Life and Works|url=http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|access-date=25 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802050948/http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|archive-date=2 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also lectured college and university students as well as the general public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deoxy Org: Alan Watts|url=http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819233823/http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|archivedate=19 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His lectures and books gave him influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s\u20131970s, but he was often seen as an outsider in academia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weidenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=Complaining about Alan Watts|url=https://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140803085526/http://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|url-status = dead|archive-date=2014-08-03}}</ref> When questioned sharply by students during his talk at [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], in 1970, Watts responded, as he had from the early sixties, that he was not an academic philosopher but rather \"a philosophical entertainer\".<ref name=\"NR\" />\n\n===Experimentation===\n\nSome of Watts' writings published in 1958 (e.g., his book ''Nature, Man and Woman'' and his essay \"The New Alchemy\") mentioned some of his early views on the use of psychedelic drugs for mystical insight. Watts had begun to experiment with psychedelics, initially with [[mescaline]] given to him by [[Oscar Janiger]]. He tried [[LSD]] several times in 1958, with various research teams led by Keith S. Ditman, Sterling Bunnell Jr., and Michael Agron. He also tried [[marijuana]] and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts' books of the '60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook.<ref name=\"Joyous 26\">''The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness'' (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book).</ref>\n\nHe later said about psychedelic drug use, \"If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.\"<ref name=\"Joyous 26\"/>\n\nFor a time, Watts came to prefer writing in the language of modern science and psychology (such as ''Psychotherapy East and West''), finding a parallel between mystical experiences and the theories of the material universe proposed by 20th-century physicists. He later equated mystical experience with ecological awareness, and typically emphasized whichever approach seemed best suited to the audience he was addressing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Applied aesthetics===\n\nWatts sometimes ate with his group of neighbors in [[Druid Heights]] (near [[Mill Valley]], California) who had endeavored to combine architecture, gardening, and carpentry skills to make a beautiful and comfortable life for themselves. These neighbors accomplished this by relying on their own talents and using their own hands, as they lived in what has been called \"shared bohemian poverty\".<ref>^ Davis, Erik (May 2005).

He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of [[aesthetics]] (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, \"\u2026 cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix\".<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 247.</ref>\n\nIn his last novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), Huxley mentions the religious practice of [[maithuna]] as being something like that which [[Roman Catholics]] call \"''[[coitus reservatus]]''\". A few years before, Watts had discussed the theme in his own book, ''Nature, Man and Woman'', in which he discusses the possibility of the practice being known to early Christians and of it being kept secretly by the Church.\n\n==Later years==\n\nIn his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of [[Ch\u00e1n]] (Zen) in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages. In his mature work, he presents himself as \"Zennist\" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him.\n\nThough known for his discourses on Zen, he was also influenced by ancient Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta. He spoke extensively about the nature of the divine reality which Man misses: how the contradiction of opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human evolution, how our fundamental Ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature of mind and ego, how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and Light, and other cosmic principles. These are discussed in great detail in dozens of hours of audio that are in part captured in the 'Out of Your Mind' series.\n\nWatts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic comments on love relationships in \"Divine Madness\" and on perception of the organism-environment in \"The Philosophy of Nature\". In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures.\n\nWatts also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament. Writing, for example, in the early 1960s: \"Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin\u2014especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?\"<ref>''The Joyous Cosmology'', p. 63</ref> These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for [[National Educational Television|NET]] (National Educational Television) filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.\n\n==Death==\n\nIn October 1973, Watts returned from a European lecture tour to his cabin in [[Druid Heights]], California. Friends of Watts had been concerned about him for some time over his [[alcoholism]].<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\"/><ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\"/> On 16 November 1973, at age 58, he died in his sleep.

He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.\n\nHe often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.\n\nWatts led some tours for Westerners to the Buddhist temples of Japan. He also studied some movements from the traditional [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial]] art [[taijiquan]], with an Asian colleague, [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]].\n\n===Worldview===\n\nIn several of his later publications, especially ''Beyond Theology'' and ''The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'', Watts put forward a [[worldview]], drawing on [[Hinduism]], [[Chinese philosophy]], [[pantheism]] or [[panentheism]], and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic Self playing hide-and-seek ([[Lila (Hinduism)|Lila]]); hiding from itself ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe and forgetting what it really is \u2013 the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an \"[[ego (spirituality)|ego]] in a bag of skin,\" or \"skin-encapsulated ego\" is a [[myth]]; the entities we call the separate \"things\" are merely aspects or features of the whole.\n\nWatts' books frequently include discussions reflecting his keen interest in patterns that occur in nature and which are repeated in various ways and at a wide range of scales \u2013 including the patterns to be discerned in the history of civilizations.<ref>De Ropp, Robert S. 2002 ''Warrior's Way''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, p. 334.</ref><ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971, pp. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Supporters and critics===\n\nWatts's explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the [[human potential movement]]. His friendship with poet [[Gary Snyder]] nurtured his sympathies with the budding [[environmental movement]], to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who credited Watts with being one of his \"Light[s] along the Way\" in the opening appreciation of ''[[Cosmic Trigger]]''. [[Werner Erhard]] attended workshops given by Alan Watts and said of him, \"He pointed me toward what I now call the distinction between Self and Mind. After my encounter with Alan, the context in which I was working shifted.\"<ref>William Warren Bartley, Werner Erhard, The Transformation of a Man</ref>\n\nWatts has been criticized by Buddhists such as [[Philip Kapleau]] and [[D. T. Suzuki]] for allegedly misinterpreting several key Zen Buddhist concepts. In particular, he drew criticism from those who believe that [[zazen]] must entail a strict and specific means of sitting, as opposed to a cultivated state of mind available at any moment in any situation. Typical of these is Kapleau's claim that Watts dismissed [[zazen]] on the basis of only half a [[koan]].<ref>Kapleau 1967, pp. 21\u201322</ref>\n\nIn regard to the aforementioned koan, [[Robert Baker Aitken]] reports that Suzuki told him, \"I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story.\"<ref>[[#refAitken|Aitken 1997]], p. 30.

Grove Press, New York 1984. Page 59.</ref> \n\nHowever, Watts did have his supporters in the Zen community, including [[Shunryu Suzuki]], the founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]]. As [[David Chadwick (writer)|David Chadwick]] recounted in his biography of Suzuki, ''Crooked Cucumber: the Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', when a student of Suzuki's disparaged Watts by saying \"we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing\", Suzuki fumed with a sudden intensity, saying, \"You completely miss the point about Alan Watts! You should notice what he has done. He is a great [[bodhisattva]].\"<ref>Chadwick, D: ''Crooked Cucumber: The Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', Broadway Books,2000</ref>\n\nWatts's biographers saw him, after his stint as an Anglican priest, as representative of no religion but as a lone-wolf thinker and social rascal. In David Stuart's warts-and-all biography of the man, Watts is seen as an unusually gifted speaker and writer driven by his own interests, enthusiasms, and demons.<ref>Stuart, David 1976 ''Alan Watts''. Pennsylvania: Chilton.</ref> Elsa Gidlow, whom Alan called \"sister\", refused to be interviewed for this work but later painted a kinder picture of Alan's life in her own autobiography, ''Elsa, I Come With My Songs''. According to critic [[Erik Davis]], his \"writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=David |first=Erik |authorlink=Erik Davis |year=2006 |title=The Visionary State: A Journey through California's Spiritual Landscape |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=0-8118-4835-3}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nWatts married three times and had seven children (five daughters and two sons). \nWatts met Eleanor Everett in 1936, when her mother, Ruth Fuller Everett, brought her to London to study piano. They met at the Buddhist Lodge, were engaged the following year and married in April 1938. A daughter, Joan, was born in November 1938 and another, Anne, was born in 1942. Their marriage ended in 1949, but Watts continued to correspond with his former mother-in-law.<ref>Stirling 2006, p. 27</ref>\nIn 1950, Watts married Dorothy DeWitt. He moved to San Francisco in early 1951 to teach. They began a family that grew to include five children: Tia, Mark, Richard, Lila, and Diane. The couple separated in the early 1960s after Watts met Mary Jane Yates King (called \"Jano\" in his circle) while lecturing in New York. After a difficult divorce he married King in 1964. The couple divided their time between [[Sausalito, California]],<ref>''The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'' (1966)</ref> where they lived on a [[houseboat]] called the ''[[Vallejo (ferry)|Vallejo]]'',<ref>Watts, Alan, 1973, pp. 300\u2013304</ref> and a secluded cabin in [[Druid Heights]], on the southwest flank of [[Mount Tamalpais]] north of San Francisco.\nSome regard Watts as having been an unfaithful husband and a poor father.<ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\">{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@julesevans/alan-watts-genius-or-charlatan-72313fae997d|title=Alan Watts: genius or charlatan?|last=Evans |first=Jules |date=2019-02-01|website=Medium |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\">{{Cite web |url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/alan-watts-reconsidered/ |title=Alan Watts Reconsidered |last=Guy |first=David |website=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWatts' eldest daughters, Joan and Anne, own and manage most of the copyrights to his books.

Approximately three hours later, he drove to a [[sorority house]], but failed to gain access. He then shot three women outside; two of them died. He next drove past a nearby deli and shot to death a male student who was inside. He then began to speed through Isla Vista, [[Drive-by shooting|shooting and wounding several pedestrians]] and [[Vehicle-ramming attack|striking several others with his car]]. Rodger exchanged gunfire with police twice during the attack, receiving a non-fatal gunshot to the hip. The rampage ended when his car crashed into a parked vehicle and came to a stop. Police found him dead inside his car with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\nJust before driving to the sorority house, Master_GamerMan uploaded to [[YouTube]] a video titled \"Master_GamerMan's Retribution\", in which he outlined details of his upcoming attack and his motives. He explained that he wanted to punish women for rejecting him, and punish sexually active men because he envied them. After uploading the video, Rodger e-mailed a lengthy autobiographical manuscript to some of his acquaintances, his therapist and several family members. The document, titled \"My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger\", was made available on the Internet and became widely known as his [[manifesto]]. In it, he described his childhood, family conflicts, frustration over [[incel|inability to find a girlfriend]], his [[misogyny|hatred of women]], his contempt for couples (especially interracial couples), and his plans for what he described as \"retribution\".\n\n== Events ==\n=== Preparation ===\nIn September 2012, Master_GamerMan visited a [[shooting range]] to train in firing handguns.<ref name=CNN.Planned/> In November&nbsp;2012, he purchased his first handgun, a [[Glock 34]] pistol, in [[Goleta, California|Goleta]] after doing research on handguns, choosing it  as \"an efficient and highly accurate weapon\".<ref name=NYTimes.Amassed/> In early 2013, Master_GamerMan bought two additional handguns, both [[SIG Sauer P226]] pistols, writing that they were \"of a much higher quality than the Glock\" and \"a lot more efficient\".<ref name=CNN.Planned/> He purchased the weapons in [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]] and [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=IntBusTimes.Police/>\n\nMaster_GamerMan claimed to have saved $5,000 of pocket money, which was given to him by his parents and grandmothers, in order to purchase the weapons and supplies that he needed for the attacks.<ref name=CNN.Planned/><ref name=Telegraph.Chamber/> [[Gun laws in California|Gun law]] experts have said that there was nothing in his known history that prevented him from making legal firearm purchases.<ref name=LATimes.Allowed/>\n\n=== Attacks ===\n[[File:2010 BMW 328i coupe -- NHTSA 01.jpg|thumb|right|A BMW 328i, similar to the car used by Rodger in the attacks.]]\nMaster_GamerMan began his attacks at his apartment on Seville Road, where three men were found dead inside.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=CNN.Timeline/> Each victim had received multiple stab wounds,<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=CNN.Timeline/><ref name=USAToday.Identify/> and all had been killed approximately three hours before the shooting spree. Their bodies were found at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. following the shootings.

Any airing of the video was refused by [[Fox News]]; instead, at the request of the network's vice president Michael Clemente, the channel only showed five still photographs. An ABC News spokesman, speaking for network president James Goldston, said, \"James said that unless there is a specific editorial reason to use it, we would err on the side of not using it.

For the memorial, UCSB chancellor [[Henry T. Yang]] and executive vice-chancellor Joel Michaelsen said in a written statement, \"This is a period of mourning for all of us.

Fuller, the executive director of the [[Treatment Advocacy Center]], said that California law permitted emergency psychiatric evaluations of potentially dangerous individuals through provisions, but such actions were never enabled during the initial police investigation of Rodger. She said,\n{{quote|Once again, we are grieving over deaths and devastation caused by a young man who was sending up red flags for danger that failed to produce intervention in time to avert tragedy. In this case, the red flags were so big the killer's parents had called police ... and yet the system failed.<ref name=WashTimes.Family/>}}\n\nSome California lawmakers called for an investigation into the deputies' contact with Rodger on April&nbsp;30. At the time of their visit, he had already bought at least two handguns, which had been entered into the California gun ownership database under his name, as required by California's universal registration law. The deputies were unaware of this fact, however, because they did not check the statewide gun ownership database. They did not view the YouTube videos that had caused Rodger's parents to contact them. The sheriff's office defended the actions of the deputies, as did other state law enforcement agencies. Some state lawmakers said they planned to introduce legislation that they believe would help prevent future such tragedies.<ref name=NYTimes.Sheriff/> On September&nbsp;30, 2014, in the wake of the incident, California legislators passed a \"[[red flag law]]\" to enable a person to ask a judge to have guns seized from a family member who they feel is a danger to themselves or to others. The gun owner will have an opportunity to contest the seizure. Gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, opposed the legislation, citing that the rights of regular gun owners may be put in jeopardy due to a misunderstanding. The law went into effect in 2016.<ref name=ABC.Restriction/>\n\n=== Misogynist and misandrist views ===\nThe attack, videos, and written manifesto of Rodger sparked conversations about broader issues of [[violence against women]] and [[misogyny]] in society.<ref name=NewStatesman.Extremism/><ref name=NYTimes.Conversation/> Rodger indicated in online postings and YouTube videos that he would punish women for denying him sex and he would also punish men who had access to sex with women, as he did not.

Approximately three hours later, he drove to a [[sorority house]], but failed to gain access. He then shot three women outside; two of them died. He next drove past a nearby deli and shot to death a male student who was inside. He then began to speed through Isla Vista, [[Drive-by shooting|shooting and wounding several pedestrians]] and [[Vehicle-ramming attack|striking several others with his car]]. Rodger exchanged gunfire with police twice during the attack, receiving a non-fatal gunshot to the hip. The rampage ended when his car crashed into a parked vehicle and came to a stop. Police found him dead inside his car with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\nJust before driving to the sorority house, Rodger uploaded to [[YouTube]] a video titled \"Elliot Rodger's Retribution\", in which he outlined details of his upcoming attack and his motives. He explained that he wanted to punish women for rejecting him, and punish sexually active men because he envied them. After uploading the video, Rodger e-mailed a lengthy autobiographical manuscript to some of his acquaintances, his therapist and several family members. The document, titled \"My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger\", was made available on the Internet and became widely known as his [[manifesto]]. In it, he described his childhood, family conflicts, frustration over [[incel|inability to find a girlfriend]], his [[misogyny|hatred of women]], his contempt for couples (especially interracial couples), and his plans for what he described as \"retribution\".\n\n== Events ==\n=== Preparation ===\nIn September 2012, Rodger visited a [[shooting range]] to train in firing handguns.<ref name=CNN.Planned/> In November&nbsp;2012, he purchased his first handgun, a [[Glock 34]] pistol, in [[Goleta, California|Goleta]] after doing research on handguns, choosing it  as \"an efficient and highly accurate weapon\".<ref name=NYTimes.Amassed/> In early 2013, Rodger bought two additional handguns, both [[SIG Sauer P226]] pistols, writing that they were \"of a much higher quality than the Glock\" and \"a lot more efficient\".<ref name=CNN.Planned/> He purchased the weapons in [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]] and [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=IntBusTimes.Police/>\n\nRodger claimed to have saved $5,000 of pocket money, which was given to him by his parents and grandmothers, in order to purchase the weapons and supplies that he needed for the attacks.<ref name=CNN.Planned/><ref name=Telegraph.Chamber/> [[Gun laws in California|Gun law]] experts have said that there was nothing in his known history that prevented him from making legal firearm purchases.<ref name=LATimes.Allowed/>\n\n=== Attacks ===\n[[File:2010 BMW 328i coupe -- NHTSA 01.jpg|thumb|right|A BMW 328i, similar to the car used by Rodger in the attacks.]]\nRodger began his attacks at his apartment on Seville Road, where three men were found dead inside.<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=CNN.Timeline/> Each victim had received multiple stab wounds,<ref name=Standard.Shooting/><ref name=CNN.Timeline/><ref name=USAToday.Identify/> and all had been killed approximately three hours before the shooting spree.

Authorities later said that the presence of a blood-soaked bath towel and paper towels in the bathroom suggest Rodger had attempted to clean the hallway after each murder. The bodies of Wang and Hong were found in their shared bedroom, whereas Chen's body was found in the bathroom.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> The positioning of the bodies suggested each victim had entered the apartment separately before being murdered, and that Rodger had made efforts to conceal the bodies of the first two victims by covering them with blankets, towels, and clothing.<ref name=DailyNexus.Report/> Police removed a knife, a hammer, and two [[machete]]s from the apartment,<ref name=NYTimes.Victims/><ref name=CNN.Roommates/> but they later determined that two knives recovered from a backpack found in Rodger's car were the weapons used to kill the apartment victims.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n\nLess than two hours preceding the shooting spree, Rodger went to a [[Starbucks]] coffee shop, where he purchased some coffee.<ref name=Sheriff.Summary/> He was later seen sitting in his car in the parking lot of his apartment building at about 8:30&nbsp;p.m.,<ref name=SBarbInd.Residents/> working on his laptop.

After receiving a copy of the manifesto, Rodger's therapist phoned his mother. She checked his [[YouTube]] channel, where she found the \"Retribution\" video that he had uploaded minutes earlier. She contacted Rodger's father, who was horrified when he watched the full video. Rodger's father, his current wife, and Rodger's mother all started frantically driving from Los Angeles to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in two separate cars. During the drive, they called police in Isla Vista and arranged to meet them upon arrival. Hearing a radio news report of a shooting in Isla Vista, his mother called the therapist, who told her it was unrelated, saying that Rodger promised to act the following day and it would be unlike him to deviate from such details. In Isla Vista they learned from the police that the news report was, in fact, about their son, who had killed six people before killing himself.<ref name=LATimes.Parents/><ref name=Sheriff.Summary/>\n\nA month after the rampage, the parents of the three stabbing victims expressed anger and frustration about multiple aspects of the case, including the failure of police to take preventive action before the attack, the limited amount of information that the authorities had released about their children's murders, more public interest in Rodger than in the victims, and perceived emphasis on the rights of the [[mental illness|mentally ill]] over the rights of victims.<ref name=WashPost.Frustration/> On March&nbsp;2, 2015, the families filed a federal [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] lawsuit against the county, the sheriff's department, the apartment building and the property management.

Any airing of the video was refused by [[Fox News]]; instead, at the request of the network's vice president Michael Clemente, the channel only showed five still photographs. An ABC News spokesman, speaking for network president James Goldston, said, \"James said that unless there is a specific editorial reason to use it, we would err on the side of not using it.

She said,\n{{quote|Once again, we are grieving over deaths and devastation caused by a young man who was sending up red flags for danger that failed to produce intervention in time to avert tragedy. In this case, the red flags were so big the killer's parents had called police ... and yet the system failed.<ref name=WashTimes.Family/>}}\n\nSome California lawmakers called for an investigation into the deputies' contact with Rodger on April&nbsp;30. At the time of their visit, he had already bought at least two handguns, which had been entered into the California gun ownership database under his name, as required by California's universal registration law. The deputies were unaware of this fact, however, because they did not check the statewide gun ownership database. They did not view the YouTube videos that had caused Rodger's parents to contact them. The sheriff's office defended the actions of the deputies, as did other state law enforcement agencies. Some state lawmakers said they planned to introduce legislation that they believe would help prevent future such tragedies.<ref name=NYTimes.Sheriff/> On September&nbsp;30, 2014, in the wake of the incident, California legislators passed a \"[[red flag law]]\" to enable a person to ask a judge to have guns seized from a family member who they feel is a danger to themselves or to others. The gun owner will have an opportunity to contest the seizure. Gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, opposed the legislation, citing that the rights of regular gun owners may be put in jeopardy due to a misunderstanding. The law went into effect in 2016.<ref name=ABC.Restriction/>\n\n=== Misogynist and misandrist views ===\nThe attack, videos, and written manifesto of Rodger sparked conversations about broader issues of [[violence against women]] and [[misogyny]] in society.<ref name=NewStatesman.Extremism/><ref name=NYTimes.Conversation/> Rodger indicated in online postings and YouTube videos that he would punish women for denying him sex and he would also punish men who had access to sex with women, as he did not.
