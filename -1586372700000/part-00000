D.L. of Faulkbourne and Mincing Lane, London and Hannah Cooke, youngest daughter of Sir Thomas Cooke, Member of Parliament for Colchester and governor of [[East India Company]].\n\nHe was educated as a fellow commoner at [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare Hall, Cambridge]] and at [[Lincoln's Inn]] (1750). He succeeded to [[Faulkbourne Hall]] on the death of his father in 1752.\n\n==Political career==\n\nAt the age of 23, he embarked on a parliamentary career that lasted 56 years and culminated in him becoming father of the house until his death.\n\nHis period in the house spanned the [[Seven Years\u2019 War]], the [[War of American Independence]], the [[French Revolution]] and the earlier [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He sat as a fellow member with the Pitts, [[Edmund Burke|Burke]], [[Charles James Fox|Fox]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]].<ref name=bullock/>\n\nHe commenced his parliamentary career in 1754 as member for [[Maldon (UK Parliament constituency)|Maldon]]; he was returned twice more for the borough in 1761 and in 1768 (polling 443 votes against the 455 of John Huske and the 328 of Jon Hennker).<ref name=bullock/> In 1774, he temporarily abandoned his parliamentary career for reasons of cost and it was not until 1780 that he returned to the house.\n\nHe was returned as member for [[Steyning (UK Parliament constituency)|Steyning]] in Sussex in 1780, which returned two members until the Reform Bill of 1832. Steyning began returning two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] from 1278 and as a [[rotten borough]] made up of a depopulated port became similar to [[Dunwich]] until the [[Reform Act 1832]].<ref name=bullock/>\n\nIn 1784, he shared the representation of the [[Essex (UK Parliament constituency)|County of Essex]] with Thomas Bramston of Screens and sat as [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] Member for the county continuously and without contest for 26 years until his death in 1809. This absence of contest was due a \"family compact\", which was the outcome of the ruinous expenses of the two previous elections, by which for more than thirty years one Whig and one Tory were regularly returned. The colonel's second co-member was [[Eliab Harvey|Admiral Harvey]] who commanded the [[HMS Temeraire (1798)|\u201cT\u00e9m\u00e9raire\u201d]] at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].<ref name=bullock/>\n\nThe Colonel is recorded as being a member of [[Boodle's]] club in St James's in 1787.\n\nDespite the efforts of other parliamentarians, the colonel resisted attempts to make him understand the complexities of foreign affairs and his kinsman, the [[Duke of Bedford]], described him as \"a good-natured fox-hunting boy\"; the colonel's grandfather was Edward Bullock MP, of [[Faulkbourne|Faulkbourne Hall]] (1663-1705),<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Parliament|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/bullock-edward-1663-1705|publisher=\u00a9 Crown copyright and The History of Parliament Trust 1964-2015|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref> whose relative  was Elizabeth Howland, Duchess of Bedford, wife of [[Wriothesley Russell, 2nd Duke of Bedford]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kimber|first1=Edward|title=The Peerage of Ireland|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=sWhUAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=elizabeth+howland+bullock+edward++john&source=bl&ots=DhQkoahbqJ&sig=uMa3rxe7r4SaMckMRIT9_UKEujc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pw5pVbjtN8a4mwW_uYGACw&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=elizabeth%20howland%20bullock%20edward%20%20john&f=false|publisher=Almon, 1768 - Page 57, \"Earl of Tylney\"|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ancestry of Colonel John Bullock|url=http://www.geni.com|publisher=geni.com|accessdate=10 Feb 2013}}</ref>  Colonel Bullock never made a speech in Parliament during his career.<ref name=osmund/>\n\nThe long duration of the \"compact\" was due to the high respect in which Colonel Bullock was held throughout the county for his political independence and he was well-liked.

A drawing shows a [[Palladian architecture|Palladianisation]] of the west front, but the later work seems to have taken it back to - and extended - the gothic original look. He ordered fine tapestries from Aubusson in France and armorial porcelain from China.<ref name=bullock/><ref name=osmund/>\n\nA patron of the arts, he founded a wide-ranging collection of pictures.

On his return he used his inherited wealth to buy in 1769 the country house of [[Sheffield Place]] in Sussex from [[John West, 2nd Earl De La Warr|Lord De La Warr]]. In 1780 he was elected to represent [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], where he was prominent against the anti-Catholic [[Lord George Gordon]] and the [[Gordon Riots|Gordon rioters]].\n\n[[File:Holroyd memorial tablet.jpg|thumb|Holroyd's memorial tablet on the family mausoleum in [[Fletching, East Sussex|Fletching]] parish church]]\nIn 1781 he was created a [[Peerage of Ireland|Peer of Ireland]] as [[Baron Sheffield]], of Dunamore in the County of Meath, and in 1783 was further created Baron Sheffield, of Roscommon in the County of Roscommon, with a [[special remainder]] in favour of his daughters.

In 1816, he was also created [[Viscount Pevensey]] and [[Earl of Sheffield]] in the Peerage of Ireland.\n\nIn 1783 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Persons&dsqSearch=Code==%27NA920%27&dsqCmd=Show.tcl|title= Fellows Details|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 10 May 2016}}</ref> In 1790 he published ''Observations on the Project for Abolishing the Slave Trade'', in which, in keeping with the opinions of his class and time, he took a conservative position on slavery, condemning the \"inconsiderate and impracticable manner in which a great proportion of the community profess a disposition to relieve Negroes from slavery.\"  Fearful of interfering with the right of enslavers to their human \"property,\" he claimed that \"nothing is more vain and empty than the idea that the British Legislature could immediately abolish slavery,\" and commended what he perceived as the \"disposition shewn by the West-Indian assemblies to do everything that might be suggested for the advantage of the Negroes\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Observations on the project for abolishing the slave trade|last=Holroyd|first=John|publisher=Printed for J.

Abigail died in 1793 and he remarried to Lady Anne North (1782?\u201318 January 1832), the daughter of the former Prime Minister [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] on 20 January 1798.\n \nThe Earl died in 1821 and was buried in the Sheffield family mausoleum attached to the north transept of the Church of St Mary and St Andrew, [[Fletching, East Sussex]]. When Edward Gibbon died in 1794 whilst visiting the Earl, he too had been buried in the same mausoleum as a mark of respect. The Holroyd family are commemorated in the surrounding panels.<ref>[http://www.mmtrust.org.uk/mausolea/view/357/Sheffield_Mausoleum Sheffield Mausoleum]</ref> The Earl's son and grandson succeeded in turn as second and third Earls of Sheffield, the latter being a well-known patron of cricket and on whose death the earldom became extinct.\n\nThe 1st Earl of Sheffield's daughter Maria Josepha married [[John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley]] in 1796, and therefore the Irish barony, under the special remainder, later passed to [[Edward Stanley, 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley]], who thus became the fourth Baron Sheffield.\n\n== Serving the Army ==\nIn 1760, upon entering the army, he led a mounted light infantry called the Royal Foresters under the command of John Manners, Marquis of Granby. After the short war, he was promoted the rank of captain (The Annual Biography and Obituary, Volume 6, 1822).\n\nIt took almost 20 years before his service is called again into war among several European powers. He started as a major and rose to the ranks of colonel when put up his own cavalry, the 22nd Regiment of Light Dragoons, during the Anglo-France War. (The Annual Biography and Obituary, Volume 6, 1822)\n\n== Works and Publications ==\nIn 1783, he wrote his opinions on the state of trade and commerce between Great Britain and its former subject America. The pamphlet Observations on the Commerce of the American States (Dublin, 1783), which ran six editions, made a comparative analysis of export and import calendar between two countries. It chronicled the amount of traded staple commodities during the prosperous year of 1773 and its disastrous year a decade; later, the fluctuations in exports and imports during peacetime and war, and all the imports and exports to West Indies among many others.\n\nIn Observations on the Manufactures, Trade, and Present State of Ireland (London, 1785), he also talked about the free trade and why Ireland and Great Britain should not proceed with its tariff war on their respective products like wool, woolens, cattle produce, fisheries, and variety of manufactures.\n\nBut in terms of agriculture, he maintained a more protectionist stance. He supported discussions on the agriculture to be of paramount importance as it tends to the true greatness and stability of a nation.\n\nHe opposed the kingdom's reliance on importation of corn, wheat, and other grains. He then published a series of pamphlet that tackles how the parliament should take care of its food production. On Observations on the Corn Bill (London, 1791), he advocated in higher yet stable price of corn, cultivate inferior land instead of using it for pasture, and emphasized that higher corn price is beneficial for manufactures.\n\nHe continued with Remarks on the Deficiency of the Grain; on the means of Present Relief, and of Future Plenty (London, 1800) where he expressed his displease on attacks against farmers on the suspicions that they are keeping the finest flour for themselves. He also asserted in his pamphlet that having rich farmers is of an utmost benefit to the society because they improve agriculture and keep the stocks of grain without too much stress to the public.\n\nAt a speech delivered in the House of Commons on 30 July 1801 he criticised the large sum they paid for importation of grain from foreign countries that arose from scarcity of grain and might result to creating a \"dangerous policy of feeding the people at the public expense\" (The Annual Biography and Obituary, Volume 6, 1822)\n\nIn 1803 he served as the President of the Board of Agriculture and as a farmer himself, considered as an authority in matters of land cultivation.\n\nHe also showed interest in maintaining the wool export. He published a volume on the topic of wool and woolen trading. First, he opposed restraining the exportation of the raw material in his Observations on the Objections made to the Exportation of Wool from Great Britain to Ireland in 1800. And in the next decade, he released a series of pamphlet from 1809-1812 On the Trade in Wool and Woollens where he noticed the weakening export to the American states. He then advocated for the importation of sheep from Spain to be bred. The same sentiments re-appeared after a decade in his Report at the Meeting at Lewes Wool Fair between 1818\u20131820.\n\nHis passion for local economy is also present in maritime industry. In his Strictures on the necessity of inviolably maintaining the Navigation and Colonial System of Great Britain (London, 1804), he pointed out that the suspension of Navigation Laws that rendered England as a free port injures every branch of the British marine. Opening up the port is deemed disadvantageous and discouraging to the seamen, shipbuilders and shipbuilding trade, and in contrary to the interest of their naval force.\n\nDespite his opinions being heralded as abreast with time, his views sometimes were considered as short-sighted and insular (Dictionary of Political Economy Volume 3, Palgrave, p.&nbsp;390). Take for instance his conservative stance on abolishment of slavery where he commented on slave trade reformers that in this pursuit many of whose property are to be sacrificed that no one is willing to compensate for whatever losses the proprietors may incur.

Jones Baker, in 1768 and added Holroyd on the death of his own father in 1778.\n\nHaving served in the [[British Army|Army]] until 1763, he travelled for a while on the continent where he became close friends with the writer and historian [[Edward Gibbon]], later the author of ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. On his return he used his inherited wealth to buy in 1769 the country house of [[Sheffield Place]] in Sussex from [[John West, 2nd Earl De La Warr|Lord De La Warr]]. In 1780 he was elected to represent [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], where he was prominent against the anti-Catholic [[Lord George Gordon]] and the [[Gordon Riots|Gordon rioters]].\n\n[[File:Holroyd memorial tablet.jpg|thumb|Holroyd's memorial tablet on the family mausoleum in [[Fletching, East Sussex|Fletching]] parish church]]\nIn 1781 he was created a [[Peerage of Ireland|Peer of Ireland]] as [[Baron Sheffield]], of Dunamore in the County of Meath, and in 1783 was further created Baron Sheffield, of Roscommon in the County of Roscommon, with a [[special remainder]] in favour of his daughters. As Irish peerages they did not interrupt his Parliamentary career and he was re-elected for Coventry in 1781 and for [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]] in 1790. His Parliamentary career did end however in 1802, when he was created a [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|Peer of the United Kingdom]] as [[Baron Sheffield]], of Sheffield in the County of York. In 1816, he was also created [[Viscount Pevensey]] and [[Earl of Sheffield]] in the Peerage of Ireland.\n\nIn 1783 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Persons&dsqSearch=Code==%27NA920%27&dsqCmd=Show.tcl|title= Fellows Details|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 10 May 2016}}</ref> In 1790 he published ''Observations on the Project for Abolishing the Slave Trade'', in which, in keeping with the opinions of his class and time, he took a conservative position on slavery, condemning the \"inconsiderate and impracticable manner in which a great proportion of the community profess a disposition to relieve Negroes from slavery.\"  Fearful of interfering with the right of enslavers to their human \"property,\" he claimed that \"nothing is more vain and empty than the idea that the British Legislature could immediately abolish slavery,\" and commended what he perceived as the \"disposition shewn by the West-Indian assemblies to do everything that might be suggested for the advantage of the Negroes\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Observations on the project for abolishing the slave trade|last=Holroyd|first=John|publisher=Printed for J.

Abigail died in 1793 and he remarried to Lady Anne North (1782?\u201318 January 1832), the daughter of the former Prime Minister [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] on 20 January 1798.\n \nThe Earl died in 1821 and was buried in the Sheffield family mausoleum attached to the north transept of the Church of St Mary and St Andrew, [[Fletching, East Sussex]]. When Edward Gibbon died in 1794 whilst visiting the Earl, he too had been buried in the same mausoleum as a mark of respect. The Holroyd family are commemorated in the surrounding panels.<ref>[http://www.mmtrust.org.uk/mausolea/view/357/Sheffield_Mausoleum Sheffield Mausoleum]</ref> The Earl's son and grandson succeeded in turn as second and third Earls of Sheffield, the latter being a well-known patron of cricket and on whose death the earldom became extinct.\n\nThe 1st Earl of Sheffield's daughter Maria Josepha married [[John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley]] in 1796, and therefore the Irish barony, under the special remainder, later passed to [[Edward Stanley, 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley]], who thus became the fourth Baron Sheffield.\n\n== Serving the Army ==\nIn 1760, upon entering the army, he led a mounted light infantry called the Royal Foresters under the command of John Manners, Marquis of Granby. After the short war, he was promoted the rank of captain (The Annual Biography and Obituary, Volume 6, 1822).\n\nIt took almost 20 years before his service is called again into war among several European powers. He started as a major and rose to the ranks of colonel when put up his own cavalry, the 22nd Regiment of Light Dragoons, during the Anglo-France War. (The Annual Biography and Obituary, Volume 6, 1822)\n\n== Works and Publications ==\nIn 1783, he wrote his opinions on the state of trade and commerce between Great Britain and its former subject America. The pamphlet Observations on the Commerce of the American States (Dublin, 1783), which ran six editions, made a comparative analysis of export and import calendar between two countries. It chronicled the amount of traded staple commodities during the prosperous year of 1773 and its disastrous year a decade; later, the fluctuations in exports and imports during peacetime and war, and all the imports and exports to West Indies among many others.\n\nIn Observations on the Manufactures, Trade, and Present State of Ireland (London, 1785), he also talked about the free trade and why Ireland and Great Britain should not proceed with its tariff war on their respective products like wool, woolens, cattle produce, fisheries, and variety of manufactures.\n\nBut in terms of agriculture, he maintained a more protectionist stance. He supported discussions on the agriculture to be of paramount importance as it tends to the true greatness and stability of a nation.\n\nHe opposed the kingdom's reliance on importation of corn, wheat, and other grains. He then published a series of pamphlet that tackles how the parliament should take care of its food production. On Observations on the Corn Bill (London, 1791), he advocated in higher yet stable price of corn, cultivate inferior land instead of using it for pasture, and emphasized that higher corn price is beneficial for manufactures.\n\nHe continued with Remarks on the Deficiency of the Grain; on the means of Present Relief, and of Future Plenty (London, 1800) where he expressed his displease on attacks against farmers on the suspicions that they are keeping the finest flour for themselves. He also asserted in his pamphlet that having rich farmers is of an utmost benefit to the society because they improve agriculture and keep the stocks of grain without too much stress to the public.\n\nAt a speech delivered in the House of Commons on 30 July 1801 he criticised the large sum they paid for importation of grain from foreign countries that arose from scarcity of grain and might result to creating a \"dangerous policy of feeding the people at the public expense\" (The Annual Biography and Obituary, Volume 6, 1822)\n\nIn 1803 he served as the President of the Board of Agriculture and as a farmer himself, considered as an authority in matters of land cultivation.\n\nHe also showed interest in maintaining the wool export. He published a volume on the topic of wool and woolen trading. First, he opposed restraining the exportation of the raw material in his Observations on the Objections made to the Exportation of Wool from Great Britain to Ireland in 1800. And in the next decade, he released a series of pamphlet from 1809-1812 On the Trade in Wool and Woollens where he noticed the weakening export to the American states. He then advocated for the importation of sheep from Spain to be bred. The same sentiments re-appeared after a decade in his Report at the Meeting at Lewes Wool Fair between 1818-1820.\n\nHis passion for local economy is also present in maritime industry. In his Strictures on the necessity of inviolably maintaining the Navigation and Colonial System of Great Britain (London, 1804), he pointed out that the suspension of Navigation Laws that rendered England as a free port injures every branch of the British marine. Opening up the port is deemed disadvantageous and discouraging to the seamen, shipbuilders and shipbuilding trade, and in contrary to the interest of their naval force.\n\nDespite his opinions being heralded as abreast with time, his views sometimes were considered as short-sighted and insular (Dictionary of Political Economy Volume 3, Palgrave, p.&nbsp;390). Take for instance his conservative stance on abolishment of slavery where he commented on slave trade reformers that in this pursuit many of whose property are to be sacrificed that no one is willing to compensate for whatever losses the proprietors may incur.

Over those years, their relationship became increasingly acrimonious. When the final break of the relationship came in 1913, Jung retreated from many of his professional activities to intensely reconsider his personal and professional path.<ref>Shamdasani gives a detailed review Jung's development and his divergence from Freud during this period in: Sonu Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', W. W. Norton, 2012, pp. 49-60. {{ISBN|978-0393073676}}</ref> The creative activity  that produced ''Liber Novus'' came in this period, from 1913 to about 1917.\n\nBiographers and critics have disagreed whether these years in Jung's life should be seen as \"a creative illness\", a period of introspection, a psychotic break, or simply madness.\"<ref>Lance S.

Jung writes in Liber Novus that during the day, \"I gave all my love and submission to things, to men, and to the thoughts of this time. I went into the desert only at night. Thus can you differentiate sick and divine delusion. Whoever does the one and does without the other you may call sick since he is out of balance.\" ''Liber Novus'', pg. 238.</ref> He maintained a busy professional practice, seeing on average five patients a day. He lectured, wrote, and remained active in professional associations.<ref>Lance S. Owens, \"The Hermeneutics of Vision: C. G.

These fantasies may be understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form.... In retrospect, he recalled that his scientific question was to see what took place when he switched off consciousness. The example of dreams indicated the existence of background activity, and he wanted to give this a possibility of emerging, just as one does when taking [[mescaline]].\"<ref>''Liber Novus'', pg. 200.</ref></blockquote>\n\nJung initially recorded his \"visions\", or \"fantasies, or \"imaginations\" \u2014 all terms used by Jung to describe his activity<ref>Owens, \"Hermeneutics of Vision\", pp. 11-13.</ref> \u2014 in a series of six journals now known collectively as the \"[[Black Books (Jung)|Black Books]]\".<ref>Shamdasani explains the nature of the \"Black Books\", and provides high-resolution photographs of these journals in:  Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pp. 63-73.</ref>  This journal record begins on 12 November 1913, and continues with intensity through the summer of 1914; subsequent entries were added up through at least the 1930s.<ref>The Black Books are currently being edited for publication: ''The Black Books of C.G. Jung (1913-1932)'', ed. Sonu Shamdasani, (Stiftung der Werke von C. G. Jung & W. W. Norton & Company), publication date pending.</ref>  Biographer [[Barbara Hannah]], who was close to Jung throughout the last three decades of his life, compared Jung's imaginative experiences recounted in his journals to the encounter of [[Menelaus]] with [[Proteus]] in the ''[[Odyssey]].''  Jung, she said, \"made it a rule never to let a figure or figures that he encountered leave until they had told him why they had appeared to him.\"<ref name=\"Hannah\">{{Cite book|last=Hannah |first=Barbara |title=Jung: His Life and Work |year=1976 |isbn=0-87773-615-4 |page=115}}</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Jung perceived that his visionary experience was not only of personal relevance, but entwined with a crucial cultural moment. In late-1914 and 1915 he compiled the visions from the journals, along with his additional commentary on each imaginative episode, into an initial manuscript. This manuscript was the beginning of ''Liber Novus''.<ref>See Shamdasani's introduction to the ''Red Book: Liber Novus'' for detailed explanation of this effort: ''Liber Novus'', pp. 198-203.</ref>\n\nIn 1915 Jung began artfully transcribing this draft text into the illuminated calligraphic volume that would subsequently become known as the ''Red Book''. In 1917 he compiled a further supplementary manuscript of visionary material and commentary, which he titled \"Scrutinies\"; this also was apparently intended for transcription into his red folio volume, the \"Red Book\".<ref>''Liber Novus'', pg. 331ff.</ref>  Although Jung labored on the artful transcription of this corpus of manuscript material into the calligraphic folio of the Red Book for sixteen years, he never completed the task. Only approximately two-thirds of Jung's manuscript text was transcribed into the Red Book by 1930, when he abandoned further work on the calligraphic transcription of his draft material into the Red Book.<ref>In the last three years of his life, Jung returned to his folio volume, and made an effort to finish the transcription.  He found it was beyond his ability, given his advanced age.  The transcription ends in mid-sentence. ''Liber Novus'', pg. 360.</ref> The published edition of ''The Red Book: Liber Novus'' includes all of Jung's manuscript material prepared for ''Liber Novus'', and not just the portion of the text transcribed by Jung into the calligraphic red book volume.<ref>See Shamdasani's  \"Editorial Note\": ''Liber Novus'', pp. 225-6.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, near the end of his life, Jung spoke to [[Aniela Jaff\u00e9]] about the ''Red Book'' and the process which yielded it; in that interview he stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"The years\u2026 when I pursued the inner images, were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer classification, scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.\"<ref>''Liber Novus'', p. vii.</ref></blockquote>In 1959, after having left the book more or less untouched for about 30 years, Jung wrote a short epilogue: \u201cTo the superficial observer, it will appear like madness.\u201d<ref name=\"Corbett\" />\n\n==Creation and physical description==\n[[File:The_Red_Book_-_Liber_Novus.jpg|thumb|right|The Red Book resting on Jung's desk]]\nJung worked his text and images in the Red Book using [[Calligraphy|calligraphic]] pen, multicolored ink, and [[gouache]] paint. The text is written in German but includes quotations from the [[Vulgate]] in Latin, a few inscriptions and names written in Latin and Greek, and a brief marginal quotation from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] given in English.\n\nThe initial seven folios (or leaves) of the book \u2014 which contain what is now entitled ''Liber Primus'' (the \"First Book\") of ''Liber Novus'' \u2014 were composed on sheets of [[parchment]] in a highly illuminated medieval style. However, as Jung proceeded working with the parchment sheets, it became apparent that their surface was not holding his paint properly and that his ink was bleeding through. These first seven leaves (fourteen pages, recto and verso) now show heavy chipping of paint, as will be noted on close examination of the facsimile edition reproductions.\n\nIn 1915, Jung commissioned the folio-sized and red leatherbound volume now known as the Red Book.<ref>High-resolution images of the Red Book appear in: Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pp. 118-9.</ref> The bound volume contained approximately 600 blank pages of paper of a quality suitable for Jung's ink and paint. The folio-sized volume, {{convert|11.57|in|cm}} by {{convert|15.35|in|cm}}, is bound in fine red leather with gilt accents. Though Jung and others usually referred to the book simply as the \"Red Book\", he had the top of the spine of the book stamped in gilt with the book's formal title, ''Liber Novus'' (\"The New Book\").\n\nJung subsequently interleaved the seven original parchment sheets at the beginning of the bound volume. After receiving the bound volume in 1915, he began transcribing his text and illustrations directly onto the bound pages. Over the next many years, Jung ultimately filled only 191 of the approximately 600 pages bound in the Red Book folio.<ref>Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pg. 119n.</ref> About a third of the manuscript material he had written was never entered into the illuminated Red Book. Inside the book now are 205 completed pages of text and illustrations (including the loose parchment sheets), all from Jung's hand:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/carl-jungs-red-book/|title=Carl Jung's Red Book|last=Grohol|first=John M.|date=2009-09-20|website=World of Psychology|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> 53 full-page images, 71 pages with both text and artwork, and 81 pages entirely of calligraphic text.\n\nThe Red Book is currently held, along with other valuable and private items from Jung's archive, in a bank vault in [[Zurich]].\n\n==Publication and display==\nDuring Jung's life, several people saw his Red Book \u2014 it was often present in his office \u2014 but only a very few individuals who were personally trusted by Jung had an opportunity to read it. After Jung's death in 1961, Jung's heirs held the book as a private legacy, and refused access to it by scholars or other interested parties.<ref name=\"Bair\">{{Cite book|last=Bair |first=Deirdre |title=Jung: A Biography |year=2003 |isbn=0-316-07665-1 |page=745}}</ref>\n\nAfter many years of careful deliberations, the estate of C. G. Jung finally decided in 2000 to allow publication of the work, and thereafter began preparations for the publication. The decision to publish was apparently aided by presentations made by Sonu Shamdasani, who had already discovered substantial private transcriptions of portions of the Red Book in archival repositories.<ref name=Corbett>{{Cite news|author=Corbett, Sara |title=The Holy Grail of the Unconscious |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/magazine/20jung-t.html|date=2009-09-16 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> Editorial efforts and preparation for publication were underwritten by major funding from the [[Philemon Foundation]].\n\nOn occasion of the publication in October 2009, the [[Rubin Museum of Art]] in New York City displayed the original book along with three of Jung's original \"Black Book\" journals and several other related artifacts; this exhibit was open from 7 October 2009 to 25 January 2010.

It recounts and comments upon the author's psychological experiments between 1913 and 1916, and is based on manuscripts first drafted by Jung in 1914\u201315 and 1917.<ref>Lance S.

Over those years, their relationship became increasingly acrimonious. When the final break of the relationship came in 1913, Jung retreated from many of his professional activities to intensely reconsider his personal and professional path.<ref>Shamdasani gives a detailed review Jung's development and his divergence from Freud during this period in: Sonu Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', W. W. Norton, 2012, pp. 49-60. {{ISBN|978-0393073676}}</ref> The creative activity  that produced ''Liber Novus'' came in this period, from 1913 to about 1917.\n\nBiographers and critics have disagreed whether these years in Jung's life should be seen as \"a creative illness\", a period of introspection, a psychotic break, or simply madness.\"<ref>Lance S.

Jung writes in Liber Novus that during the day, \"I gave all my love and submission to things, to men, and to the thoughts of this time. I went into the desert only at night. Thus can you differentiate sick and divine delusion. Whoever does the one and does without the other you may call sick since he is out of balance.\" ''Liber Novus'', pg. 238.</ref> He maintained a busy professional practice, seeing on average five patients a day. He lectured, wrote, and remained active in professional associations.<ref>Lance S. Owens, \"The Hermeneutics of Vision: C. G.

These fantasies may be understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form.... In retrospect, he recalled that his scientific question was to see what took place when he switched off consciousness. The example of dreams indicated the existence of background activity, and he wanted to give this a possibility of emerging, just as one does when taking mescaline.\"<ref>''Liber Novus'', pg. 200.</ref></blockquote>\n\nJung initially recorded his \"visions\", or \"fantasies, or \"imaginations\" \u2014 all terms used by Jung to describe his activity<ref>Owens, \"Hermeneutics of Vision\", pp. 11-13.</ref> \u2014 in a series of six  journals now known collectively as the \"[[Black Books (Jung)|Black Books]]\".<ref>Shamdasani explains the nature of the \"Black Books\", and provides high-resolution photographs of these journals in:  Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pp. 63-73.</ref>  This journal record begins on 12 November 1913, and continues with intensity through the summer of 1914; subsequent entries were added up through at least the 1930s.<ref>The Black Books are currently being edited for publication: ''The Black Books of C.G. Jung (1913-1932)'', ed. Sonu Shamdasani, (Stiftung der Werke von C. G. Jung & W. W. Norton & Company), publication date pending.</ref>  Biographer [[Barbara Hannah]], who was close to Jung throughout the last three decades of his life, compared Jung's imaginative experiences recounted in his journals to the encounter of [[Menelaus]] with [[Proteus]] in the ''[[Odyssey]].''  Jung, she said, \"made it a rule never to let a figure or figures that he encountered leave until they had told him why they had appeared to him.\"<ref name=\"Hannah\">{{Cite book|last=Hannah |first=Barbara |title=Jung: His Life and Work |year=1976 |isbn=0-87773-615-4 |page=115}}</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Jung perceived that his visionary experience was not only of personal relevance, but entwined with a crucial cultural moment. In late-1914 and 1915 he compiled the visions from the journals, along with his additional commentary on each imaginative episode, into an initial manuscript. This manuscript was the beginning of ''Liber Novus''.<ref>See Shamdasani's introduction to the ''Red Book: Liber Novus'' for detailed explanation of this effort: ''Liber Novus'', pp. 198-203.</ref>\n\nIn 1915 Jung began artfully transcribing this draft text into the illuminated calligraphic volume that would subsequently become known as the ''Red Book''. In 1917 he compiled a further supplementary manuscript of visionary material and commentary, which he titled \"Scrutinies\"; this also was apparently intended for transcription into his red folio volume, the \"Red Book\".<ref>''Liber Novus'', pg. 331ff.</ref>  Although Jung labored on the artful transcription of this corpus of manuscript material into the calligraphic folio of the Red Book for sixteen years, he never completed the task. Only approximately two-thirds of Jung's manuscript text was transcribed into the Red Book by 1930, when he abandoned further work on the calligraphic transcription of his draft material into the Red Book.<ref>In the last three years of his life, Jung returned to his folio volume, and made an effort to finish the transcription.  He found it was beyond his ability, given his advanced age.  The transcription ends in mid-sentence. ''Liber Novus'', pg. 360.</ref> The published edition of ''The Red Book: Liber Novus'' includes all of Jung's manuscript material prepared for ''Liber Novus'', and not just the portion of the text transcribed by Jung into the calligraphic red book volume.<ref>See Shamdasani's  \"Editorial Note\": ''Liber Novus'', pp. 225-6.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, near the end of his life, Jung spoke to [[Aniela Jaff\u00e9]] about the ''Red Book'' and the process which yielded it; in that interview he stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"The years\u2026 when I pursued the inner images, were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer classification, scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.\"<ref>''Liber Novus'', p. vii.</ref></blockquote>In 1959, after having left the book more or less untouched for about 30 years, Jung wrote a short epilogue: \u201cTo the superficial observer, it will appear like madness.\u201d<ref name=\"Corbett\" />\n\n==Creation and physical description==\n[[File:The_Red_Book_-_Liber_Novus.jpg|thumb|right|The Red Book resting on Jung's desk]]\nJung worked his text and images in the Red Book using [[Calligraphy|calligraphic]] pen, multicolored ink, and [[gouache]] paint. The text is written in German but includes quotations from the [[Vulgate]] in Latin, a few inscriptions and names written in Latin and Greek, and a brief marginal quotation from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] given in English.\n\nThe initial seven folios (or leaves) of the book \u2014 which contain what is now entitled ''Liber Primus'' (the \"First Book\") of ''Liber Novus'' \u2014 were composed on sheets of [[parchment]] in a highly illuminated medieval style. However, as Jung proceeded working with the parchment sheets, it became apparent that their surface was not holding his paint properly and that his ink was bleeding through. These first seven leaves (fourteen pages, recto and verso) now show heavy chipping of paint, as will be noted on close examination of the facsimile edition reproductions.\n\nIn 1915, Jung commissioned the folio-sized and red leatherbound volume now known as the Red Book.<ref>High-resolution images of the Red Book appear in: Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pp. 118-9.</ref> The bound volume contained approximately 600 blank pages of paper of a quality suitable for Jung's ink and paint. The folio-sized volume, {{convert|11.57|in|cm}} by {{convert|15.35|in|cm}}, is bound in fine red leather with gilt accents. Though Jung and others usually referred to the book simply as the \"Red Book\", he had the top of the spine of the book stamped in gilt with the book's formal title, ''Liber Novus'' (\"The New Book\").\n\nJung subsequently interleaved the seven original parchment sheets at the beginning of the bound volume. After receiving the bound volume in 1915, he began transcribing his text and illustrations directly onto the bound pages. Over the next many years, Jung ultimately filled only 191 of the approximately 600 pages bound in the Red Book folio.<ref>Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pg. 119n.</ref> About a third of the manuscript material he had written was never entered into the illuminated Red Book. Inside the book now are 205 completed pages of text and illustrations (including the loose parchment sheets), all from Jung's hand:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/carl-jungs-red-book/|title=Carl Jung's Red Book|last=Grohol|first=John M.|date=2009-09-20|website=World of Psychology|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> 53 full-page images, 71 pages with both text and artwork, and 81 pages entirely of calligraphic text.\n\nThe Red Book is currently held, along with other valuable and private items from Jung's archive, in a bank vault in [[Zurich]].\n\n==Publication and display==\nDuring Jung's life, several people saw his Red Book \u2014 it was often present in his office \u2014 but only a very few individuals who were personally trusted by Jung had an opportunity to read it. After Jung's death in 1961, Jung's heirs held the book as a private legacy, and refused access to it by scholars or other interested parties.<ref name=\"Bair\">{{Cite book|last=Bair |first=Deirdre |title=Jung: A Biography |year=2003 |isbn=0-316-07665-1 |page=745}}</ref>\n\nAfter many years of careful deliberations, the estate of C. G. Jung finally decided in 2000 to allow publication of the work, and thereafter began preparations for the publication. The decision to publish was apparently aided by presentations made by Sonu Shamdasani, who had already discovered substantial private transcriptions of portions of the Red Book in archival repositories.<ref name=Corbett>{{Cite news|author=Corbett, Sara |title=The Holy Grail of the Unconscious |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/magazine/20jung-t.html|date=2009-09-16 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> Editorial efforts and preparation for publication were underwritten by major funding from the [[Philemon Foundation]].\n\nOn occasion of the publication in October 2009, the [[Rubin Museum of Art]] in New York City displayed the original book along with three of Jung's original \"Black Book\" journals and several other related artifacts; this exhibit was open from 7 October 2009 to 25 January 2010.

Lubbock was also a [[merchant]] and [[Member of Parliament]]. He was the first son of a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] don, the [[William Lubbock|Reverend William Lubbock]] of [[Lamas, Norfolk|Lammas, Norfolk]], by Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Cooper of North Walsham, Norfolk. He married Elizabeth Christiana Commerell, daughter of his business partner, Frederick Commerell of Hanwell, Middlesex and his wife Catherine Elton on 12 Oct 1771 at St Dunstan's in the East, London. They had no children. In 1806 he was created a baronet, of Lammas, with remainder to his nephew [[Sir John Lubbock, 2nd Baronet|John William Lubbock]], who succeeded him as second baronet.\n\n==Career==\n===Business===\nHe was sent to London to learn business in the house of Commerell in [[Bishopsgate|Bishopsgate Street]], London, of which he became a partner after his marriage. John adopted his nephew, John William Lubbock and had him educated at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]. After, he taught John William about his business.\n\nIn 1772, Lubbock became a partner in the London bank of Lemon, Buller, Finlay and Lubbock of 15 Abchurch Lane and later [[Mansion House, London#Mansion House Street|Mansion House Street]]. In 1785, the partnership changed to Forster, Lubbock and Bosanquet and in 1801 to Forster, Lubbock, Forster and Clarke. Finally, in 1814, it was Sir John Lubbock, Lubbock & Co, the second partner being John William Lubbock, John's nephew and heir.\n\n===Political===\nIn 1784, he intended to stand as parliamentary candidate for the [[Devizes (UK Parliament constituency)|Devizes constituency]] in [[Wiltshire]] but eventually declined the poll \u2018for the sake of peace\u2019. In November 1795, he was one of the sponsors of the London merchants and bankers loyal declaration of support for Pitt's government. At the ensuing election in 1796, he was returned for [[Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency)|Bossiney]] in [[Cornwall]] as a guest of Lord Mount Edgecumbe. In 1802, he appeared as a candidate for [[Leominster (UK Parliament constituency)|Leominster]], [[Herefordshire]] and secured his election with votes as follows\n\n*John Lubbock 498\n*Hon Charles Kinnaird 335\n*Mr. Taylor 281\n\nIn 1794, the Directory of London & Westminster & Southwark shows him as a merchant in business with his partner F. Commerell at 2 [[St Mildred, Poultry|St Mildred's Court, Poultry]] in the City of London.\n\nIn 1806, he was re-elected without opposition. There he remained until his retirement in favour of his nephew in 1812.\n\n==Baronetcy==\nIn 1797, he insisted that the bank was fully competent to liquidate all the demands that could be brought against it, and recommended that \u00a33,000,000 should be added to the capital, to enable the directors to discount to such an amount as would accommodate the commercial world.\nHe was well disposed to the Greville ministry, which made him a baronet on 9 Apr 1806. John accepted this on the condition that he might pass it on to his nephew John William. This was granted and John William in gratitude chose the family motto to go with it \"Auctor pretiosa facit\" (the giver makes the gift precious). He was listed amongst the \"staunch friends\" of the abolition of the slave trade at around the same time. His nephew wrote of him \"he was an excellent man of business and a genial, kind friend. He was fond of horses and hunting and used to drive 4 Greys into the City from his house in St James Place, which he had purchased in 1802 with [[Samuel Rogers]] the poet; Sir John taking two-thirds and Mr Rogers one-third.\n\n==Residences==\nSir John bought a large house on the west side of [[Clapham Common]] on 25 May 1787 from Isaac Akerman, and after a short period of residence there let it to [[William Gerard Hamilton|W. G. Hamilton]] MP (known as \"Single Speech\" Hamilton). By then known as Battersea Rise, this house was sold in August 1792 to the abolitionist Henry Thornton, who for some years shared it with his cousin and political ally [[William Wilberforce]]. Lubbock's acquaintance with these gentlemen helps to explain his anti-slavery stance. Afterwards he rented Marble Hill Cottage near Richmond from a Miss Hotham, daughter of Sir Charles Hotham, Bart. (this being the first known link between those two families; the son of his heir and nephew was later to marry Harriet Hotham) from 1792. He then purchased it in 1807 and kept it as a residence until 1812. Other residences included [[Honingham Hall]] in Norfolk (living there in 1796), Lammas in Norfolk, 13 Token House Yard in London (Jan 1765 \u2013 Jul 1768), St Mildred's Court, Poultry in the City of  London (1783 - his death), Broad Street, Walthamstow (1771\u20131774), Stratford Place (from Jun 1794), Oxford Street (1794 \u2013 his death) and a house in [[Gorleston-on-Sea|Gorleston]], Norfolk which he sold in Mar 1802.\n\n==Portraits==\nTwo portraits of John are known. The first is a full-length portrait of him as a young man aged about 18 (see above), which used to be at [[High Elms Country Park|High Elms]] in Kent, the family home during the 19th and 20th centuries. The second is of a more rotund version of him in much later life seated in a chair. There is also a picture of his young wife dated 1774 by John Downman, which appeared for sale advertised in ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine. The portrait shown was lost when the family home at High Elms burned down in 1967. The portrait of the elderly man is held at Clapham Library.\n\n==Death==\nHe died on 24 Feb 1816 at [[St James's Place|23 St James Place]]. He is buried at [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]] where there were tablets to his memory, and that of his wife, in the belltower. There is no sign of them now and it is thought that the memorials may have been destroyed in the blitz.  His wife outlived him by many years, moving to [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]] in Sussex after her husband's death. She eventually died there in 1845 at the age of 94.\n\n==References==\n*{{Rayment-bt|date=March 2012}}\n*{{Rayment-hc|date=March 2012}}\n* The History of Parliament (the House of Commons) Vol IV 1790-1820\n* A biographical index to the present House of Commons, 1808\n* ''The Family of Lubbock'' by Robert Birkbeck, 1891\n* Occasional papers of the [[Clapham Antiquarian Society]], [[Minet Library]], Lambeth\n* ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' Dec 1987\n* Holdens Directory\n* Annals of the Borough of Devizes 1791\u20131835, ii 263\n\n==External links==\n* {{Hansard-contribs | mr-john-lubbock | Sir John Lubbock }}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-par|gb}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency)|Bossiney]]\n | years  = 1796\u2013[[1801 United Kingdom general election|1800]]\n | with   = [[John Stuart-Wortley]] 1796\u20131797\n | with2  = [[James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe|James Stuart-Wortley]] from 1797\u20131800\n | before = [[Evelyn Pierrepont (MP)|Evelyn Pierrepont]]<br />[[James Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie|James Archibald Stuart]]\n | after  = Parliament of the United Kingdom\n}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency)|Bossiney]]\n | years  = [[1801 United Kingdom general election|1801]]\u2013[[1802 United Kingdom general election|1802]]\n | with   = [[James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe|James Stuart-Wortley]]\n | before = Parliament of Great Britain\n | after  = [[James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe|James Stuart-Wortley]]<br />[[John Hiley Addington]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Leominster (UK Parliament constituency)|Leominster]]\n | years  = 1802\u20131812\n | with   = [[Charles Kinnaird, 8th Lord Kinnaird|Charles Kinnaird]] 1802 \u2013 January 1806\n | with2  = [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|William Lamb]] January \u2013 November 1806\n | with3  = [[Henry Bonham (politician)|Henry Bonham]] November 1806\u20131812\n | before = [[William Taylor (MP for Leominster)|William Taylor]]<br />[[George Augustus Pollen]]\n | after  = [[Sir John William Lubbock, 2nd Baronet|John Lubbock]]<br />[[John Harcourt]]\n}}\n{{s-reg|uk-bt}}\n{{s-new | creation }}\n{{s-ttl\n | title = [[Baron Avebury|Baronet]]<br />'''(of Lammas)'''\n | years = 1806\u20131816\n}}\n{{s-aft  | after=[[Sir John Lubbock, 2nd Baronet|John William Lubbock]] }}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lubbock, John, 1st Baronet}}\n[[Category:1744 births]]\n[[Category:1816 deaths]]\n[[Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:English bankers]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for constituencies in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for constituencies in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:British MPs 1796\u20131800]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1801\u20131802]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1802\u20131806]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1806\u20131807]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1807\u20131812]]\n[[Category:Lubbock family|John]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=March 2014}}\n[[File:John Lubbock, 1st Baronet.jpg|right|thumb|John Lubbock, 1st Baronet as a young man with his dog]]\n'''Sir John Lubbock, 1st Baronet''' (bapt 20 August 1744 \u2013 24 February 1816) was an eminent [[England|English]] [[banker]]. Lubbock was also a [[merchant]] and [[Member of Parliament]]. He was the first son of a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] don, the [[William Lubbock|Reverend William Lubbock]] of [[Lamas, Norfolk|Lammas, Norfolk]], by Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Cooper of North Walsham, Norfolk. He married Elizabeth Christiana Commerell, daughter of his business partner, Frederick Commerell of Hanwell, Middlesex and his wife Catherine Elton on 12 Oct 1771 at St Dunstan's in the East, London. They had no children. In 1806 he was created a baronet, of Lammas, with remainder to his nephew [[Sir John Lubbock, 2nd Baronet|John William Lubbock]], who succeeded him as second baronet.\n\n==Career==\n===Business===\nHe was sent to London to learn business in the house of Commerell in [[Bishopsgate|Bishopsgate Street]], London, of which he became a partner after his marriage. John adopted his nephew, John William Lubbock and had him educated at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]. After, he taught John William about his business.\n\nIn 1772, Lubbock became a partner in the London bank of Lemon, Buller, Finlay and Lubbock of 15 Abchurch Lane and later [[Mansion House, London#Mansion House Street|Mansion House Street]]. In 1785, the partnership changed to Forster, Lubbock and Bosanquet and in 1801 to Forster, Lubbock, Forster and Clarke. Finally, in 1814, it was Sir John Lubbock, Lubbock & Co, the second partner being John William Lubbock, John's nephew and heir.\n\n===Political===\nIn 1784, he intended to stand as parliamentary candidate for the [[Devizes (UK Parliament constituency)|Devizes constituency]] in [[Wiltshire]] but eventually declined the poll \u2018for the sake of peace\u2019. In November 1795, he was one of the sponsors of the London merchants and bankers loyal declaration of support for Pitt's government. At the ensuing election in 1796, he was returned for [[Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency)|Bossiney]] in [[Cornwall]] as a guest of Lord Mount Edgecumbe. In 1802, he appeared as a candidate for [[Leominster (UK Parliament constituency)|Leominster]], [[Herefordshire]] and secured his election with votes as follows\n\n*John Lubbock 498\n*Hon Charles Kinnaird 335\n*Mr. Taylor 281\n\nIn 1794, the Directory of London & Westminster & Southwark shows him as a merchant in business with his partner F. Commerell at 2 [[St Mildred, Poultry|St Mildred's Court, Poultry]] in the City of London.\n\nIn 1806, he was re-elected without opposition. There he remained until his retirement in favour of his nephew in 1812.\n\n==Baronetcy==\nIn 1797, he insisted that the bank was fully competent to liquidate all the demands that could be brought against it, and recommended that \u00a33,000,000 should be added to the capital, to enable the directors to discount to such an amount as would accommodate the commercial world.\nHe was well disposed to the Greville ministry, which made him a baronet on 9 Apr 1806. John accepted this on the condition that he might pass it on to his nephew John William. This was granted and John William in gratitude chose the family motto to go with it \"Auctor pretiosa facit\" (the giver makes the gift precious). He was listed amongst the \"staunch friends\" of the abolition of the slave trade at around the same time. His nephew wrote of him \"he was an excellent man of business and a genial, kind friend. He was fond of horses and hunting and used to drive 4 Greys into the City from his house in St James Place, which he had purchased in 1802 with [[Samuel Rogers]] the poet; Sir John taking two-thirds and Mr Rogers one-third.\n\n==Residences==\nSir John bought a large house on the west side of [[Clapham Common]] on 25 May 1787 from Isaac Akerman, and after a short period of residence there let it to [[William Gerard Hamilton|W. G. Hamilton]] MP (known as \"Single Speech\" Hamilton). By then known as Battersea Rise, this house was sold in August 1792 to the abolitionist Henry Thornton, who for some years shared it with his cousin and political ally [[William Wilberforce]]. Lubbock's acquaintance with these gentlemen helps to explain his anti-slavery stance. Afterwards he rented Marble Hill Cottage near Richmond from a Miss Hotham, daughter of Sir Charles Hotham, Bart. (this being the first known link between those two families; the son of his heir and nephew was later to marry Harriet Hotham) from 1792. He then purchased it in 1807 and kept it as a residence until 1812. Other residences included [[Honingham Hall]] in Norfolk (living there in 1796), Lammas in Norfolk, 13 Token House Yard in London (Jan 1765 \u2013 Jul 1768), St Mildred's Court, Poultry in the City of  London (1783 - his death), Broad Street, Walthamstow (1771\u20131774), Stratford Place (from Jun 1794), Oxford Street (1794 \u2013 his death) and a house in [[Gorleston-on-Sea|Gorleston]], Norfolk which he sold in Mar 1802.\n\n==Portraits==\nTwo portraits of John are known.
