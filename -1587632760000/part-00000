Some of the stock was also used on the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] between [[Woodford tube station|Woodford]] and [[Hainault tube station|Hainault]] between 21 February 1968 and 1984, as the same [[automatic train operation]] (ATO) system was used on both lines.<ref>{{harvnb |Hardy |2002 |p=10}}</ref>\n\nA total of 316 cars (39.5 train sets) were built by [[Metro-Cammell]], and the stock was refurbished at [[Rosyth]].<ref>{{harvnb |Hardy |2002 |p=11}}</ref> Withdrawn cars of Mk I [[London Underground 1972 stock|1972 stock]] were later moved into the 1967 stock fleet in the 1990s, thus creating a fleet of 43 1967 stock trains. As they did not feature ATO, they were only used as non-driving cars, positioned in the middle of trains rather than at the ends. By the beginning of their retirement in 2010 the 1967 stock had achieved a [[mean distance between failures]] of over {{convert|14,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/Item04-RUP-7-7-2010-MD-report-LU.pdf|page=4|title=Managing Director's Report \u2013 London Underground|date=7 July 2010|publisher=Transport for London}}</ref>\n\nEach complete train consisted of two four-car units coupled together. Being ATO equipped, the train operator started the train by simultaneously pressing two buttons in the cab to start the automatic process. The trains were the first London Underground rolling stock to be built with wrap-around windows in the driving cabs.\n\nThe trains were maintained at [[Northumberland Park Depot]].\n\n==Background==\nLondon Transport had built a batch of 12 prototype motor cars, known as the [[London Underground 1960 Stock|1960 stock]], to test out a number of new features,<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=86}}</ref> and it was originally intended that these would form the basis for a production run to replace the ageing [[London Underground Standard Stock|Standard Stock]]. However, tube usage was increasing, and with the Standard Stock proving unreliable in these new circumstances, the decision was taken to build the [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 stock]], which was essentially the same as the earlier [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 stock]]. Metropolitan-Cammell, the manufacturers, built both classes on the same production line, without a break.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=91}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1962, after years of lobbying by London Transport, the government authorised the construction of the Victoria line, a completely new {{convert|10.5|mi|km|adj=on}} underground line running from [[Walthamstow Central station|Walthamstow]] to [[Victoria tube station|Victoria]]. Designs for the line included high levels of automation, and this included [[Automatic Train Operation]].{{sfn |Green|1987 |pp=58\u201359}} Trials were carried out on the [[District line]], and once it had been established that automatic train operation was feasible, a full-scale trial was run on the [[Woodford tube station|Woodford]] to [[Hainault tube station|Hainault]] section of the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]]. Five of the six trains of 1960 stock were modified,{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |p=93}} and automatic operation of the branch began on 5 April 1964. This enabled the system for the 1967 stock to be thoroughly tested,{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |p=95}} and early units of the stock were tested out on the branch.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=106}}\n\n==Design==\nThe 1967 Stock was the first opportunity to build cars which included many of the enhancements tried out in the 1960 Stock. They were designed for the Victoria line, and each train consisted of eight cars, marshalled as two four-car units. Each unit had a driving motor car at both ends, and two trailer cars between them. The outer ends of the motor cars were fitted with Wedglock automatic couplers, and all cars in a unit were semi-permanently coupled together. It was not expected that units would be uncoupled in service, and the arrangement on previous stock where uncoupling required simultaneous operations to be performed in both cabs was replaced by one where uncoupling could be initiated in the first car and completed afterwards in the second.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=96}}</ref>\n\nThe Victoria line was to be equipped for automatic operation, and the driver was replaced by a \"train operator\", with responsibility for shutting the doors, and then pressing two buttons simultaneously to start the train, after which the train would move under automatic control until the next station was reached.{{sfn |Glover |1996 |p=117}} However, a single controller to allow the trains to be driven manually in the depot or in emergency while in service was provided. This incorporated both traction control and braking. Door controls were provided in the cabs, and a facility to isolate either of the two units from the leading cab was also included. For the first time on tube stock, all control circuits were switched by cam-operated [[Miniature snap-action switch|micro-switches]]. They were used on the traction and brake controller, the disconnecting units, the fault isolating switches, the door controls and other control equipment, and resulted in a significant reduction in the routine electrical inspection needing to be carried out.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=97}}</ref>\n\n[[Dynamic braking|Rheostatic braking]] was used on the trains, and required amendments to the standard P.C.M. (Pneumatic Camshaft Motor) controllers, to include the switching in of the rheostats. When the train was to be stopped, rheostatic braking was used first, after which [[Railway air brake|friction brakes]] on the trailer cars were brought into action. If required, friction brakes on the motor cars could also be used. The rheostatic braking fades as the speed drops below {{convert|10|mph|kph}}, and so slow speed braking was always by friction brake. As on the 1960 Stock, traction was supplied by four motors, one on each axle. The motors on each [[bogie]] were wired in series permanently, and the traction controller performed series/parallel switching of the pairs of motors. The handbrake used hydraulic power to apply it, and then remained locked on until hydraulic pressure was used to release it.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |pp=97\u201398}}</ref>\n\nWindow design followed the 1960 Stock, consisting of two large windows between each set of doors, giving a double-glazed appearance. The doors opened into the gap between the inner and outer skins. However, on the doors themselves, the windows were curved, so that the top was much higher than previous designs, allowing passengers to see station signs without stooping. Visibility for the driver was improved by the provision of wrap-around cab windows. Loading times at stations were improved by providing a stand-back beside the doors, so that passengers standing near the doors did not block so much of the exit. Lighting was by [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent tube]], with two lights in each car fed from the battery through an invertor, so that they remained lit should the motor alternator shut down.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |pp=98\u201399}}</ref> Two types of motor alternator were used. Some were manufactured by [[Associated Electrical Industries|AEI]], and generated 230 V AC at 850&nbsp;Hz, which was stepped down to 115 V for the lighting and 58 V for the battery charger. The alternative was manufactured by [[English Electric]], and generated 60 V at 850&nbsp;Hz, which was stepped up for the lighting.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=103}}</ref>\n\nThe trains were the first in the system to be designed by an artistic designer (Professor [[Misha Black]]), rather than an engineer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Underground \u2013 Official Handbook|date=2000|author=Bayman, Bob|publisher=Capital Transport|page=66}}</ref>\n\n===Delivery===\nWhen first opened, the Victoria line terminated at [[London Victoria station|Victoria station]]. They were fitted with [[Automatic train operation]] (ATO) equipment, which had been tested on the Woodford to Hainault section of the Central line, using modified 1960 Stock trains. At first, trains were delivered to Ruislip Depot on the Piccadilly line. Following initial preparation for service, they were then transferred to Hainault Depot, where they ran as single units, so that the ATO equipment could be thoroughly tested. Once passed, they were taken to Leytonstone, from where [[London Underground battery-electric locomotives|battery locomotives]] were used to haul them over [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]] tracks to Northumberland Park Depot. After September 1968, when the first part of the Victoria line opened, trains were transferred from Ruislip to Northumberland Park directly, via a connecting link between the Piccadilly line and the Victoria line at Finsbury Park. Several four-car units were briefly transferred to operate the Woodford-Hainault service over the years, when the 1960 Stock units needed modification or overhaul.<ref name=bruce106>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=106}}</ref>\n\nThe extension of the Victoria line to [[Brixton tube station|Brixton]] required additional trains, and a further 18 four-car units were built. These were identical to the original units, and the numbering scheme followed on from where the first batch ended. Increasing traffic levels on the Victoria line during the 1980s eventually required more trains, which posed a problem, since no other stock could operate on the line, because of the need for it to operate automatically.<ref name=bruce106/> The [[London Underground 1972 Stock|1972 Mk I Stock]] was similar, although it was built to run as seven-car trains, with a four-car unit much like the 1967 stock, and a three-car unit consisting of a driving motor car, a trailer car, and an uncoupling non-driving motor car, which was a motor car with no cab for the driver. Instead it was fitted with a shunting control cabinet at the outer end. The main differences between the 1967 and the 1972 stock was that the latter was designed for two-man operation, having door controls for the guard at the trailing end of the driving motor cars, and that it was reversible, as it had been ordered for the Northern line, where the Kennington Loop can result in either end of the train facing the north end of the line.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=109}}</ref>\n\nHowever, most of the equipment was compatible with the 1967 stock, and so some of the 1972 stock was modified to work on the Victoria line. Two seven-car trains would be split up, and the uncoupling non-driving motors would be discarded, providing three four-car units. From an eight-car train, the outer motor cars would be removed, and used to replace the inner motor cars of an eight-car train of 1967 stock, releasing two motor cars fitted with ATO equipment, which would then be fitted to the outer ends of the 1972 stock.<ref name=bruce106/> The conversion work was carried out at Acton Works.<ref name=hardy18>{{harvnb |Hardy |1993 |p=18}}</ref> Fourteen driving motor and fourteen trailer cars were added to the Victoria line stock by this method between 1987 and 1989, and a further two driving motor cars and one trailer were added between 1995 and 1999.{{sfn |TfL |2007 |p=3}}\n\n===Automatic operation===\nThe system of automatic train operation developed for the Victoria line, and hence the 1967 Stock, used two types of coded signals, which were fed into the running rails, and pickup up by two independent sets of coils on the train. The first was the safety signalling system, which used a continuous signal encoded at 125&nbsp;Hz. This was used to pass codes at 420, 270 or 180 pulses per minute (ppm) to the control circuits. Failure to receive any of these codes resulted in the emergency brake operating. 180 ppm allowed the train to operate at speeds up to {{convert|25|mph|kph}} but did not allow power to be applied if it had previously been shut off. 270 ppm allowed the train to operate up to the same speed, but power could also be re-applied if it had previously been shut off. Finally, 420 ppm allowed the train to run at the speeds set by the driving command system, which was the second of the two coded message systems.<ref name=bruce107>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=107}}</ref>\n\nThe driving command system used short sections of the running rails, {{convert|10|ft|m|2}} long, which were called 'spots', and carried signals coded at between 1&nbsp;kHz and 20&nbsp;kHz. Running speeds were coded so that 100&nbsp;Hz represented {{convert|1|mph|kph}}, so a 3.5&nbsp;kHz spot indicated that the train should be travelling at {{convert|35|mph|kph}} and a 2&nbsp;kHz spot that it should be travelling at {{convert|20|mph|kph}}. In addition, a 15&nbsp;kHz spot indicated that the traction motors should be shut down, but the train allowed to coast, while a 20&nbsp;kHz spot indicated that the train should stop, as the next signal was at danger. When a train passed a speed control spot on the approach to a station, the brakes were applied at different rates, depending on whether the train was travelling faster or slower than the specified speed. Once the speed was below {{convert|4|mph|kph}}, the brakes were released slightly, to ensure a smooth stop, and the resting position would be within {{convert|5|ft|m}} of the desired stop point.<ref name=bruce107/>\n\nBraking spots were provided at {{convert|5|mph|kph|adj=on}} increments, from the expected maximum speed downwards, but if the train had been stopped at a signal by a 20&nbsp;kHz spot, for instance, the actual speed on approaching the station would be much slower, and the outer spots would be ignored. Speed control was by an electronic governor and a frequency generator mounted on one of the traction motors, with an overriding mechanical governor, connected to one of the axles on the trailer cars.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=110}}</ref> All trains were fitted with a fail-safe trip valve connected to the emergency brakes, and the mechanical governor operated this device if the speed exceeded {{convert|25|mph|kph}} when the 420 code was not being received, if the speed exceeded {{convert|50|mph|kph}} under any circumstances, or if the speed exceeded {{convert|11.5|mph|kph}} when the train was being operated in 'slow manual' mode. The trains could be driven manually at speeds up to {{convert|25|mph|kph}} if safety codes were still being received, or at {{convert|10|mph|kph}} if no codes were being received, either because of a failure or because the train was in the depot, where the tracks were not coded.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |pp=110, 112}}</ref>\n\n===Refurbishment===\nBeginning in 1989, all of the 43 8-car trains were taken to Acton Works, where they were fitted with passenger alarms, a public address system and other safety related features. The original hydraulic parking brakes were replaced by a new spring-operated brake. Following these changes, two units were selected for refurbishment, which was undertaken by Tickford Rail of Rosyth Royal Dockyard and Vic Berry of [[Leicester]]. The work included replacement of the seats, lighting, panelling and grab rails. Externally, the cars were painted in a red, white and blue livery. The two units resumed service on 9 October 1989, and in June 1990, a rolling programme to update all of the cars was awarded to Tickford Rail.<ref name=hardy18/> The work was completed in 1995.{{sfn |TfL |2007 |p=2}}\n\n==Roster==\nAs delivered, the numbering system composed of the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background-color:#ccc;\" colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n|colspan=\"4\"|<div style=\"float:left\">\u2190 [[Brixton tube station|Brixton]] (D)</div><div style=\"float:right\">[[Walthamstow Central station|Walthamstow]] (A) \u2192</div>\n|-style=\"border-top:solid 3px #{{LUL color|Victoria}};\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Formation\n|style=\"width:5em\"|'''30xx'''<br />(DM)\n|style=\"width:5em\"|'''40xx'''<br />(T)\n|style=\"width:5em\"|'''41xx'''<br />(T)\n|style=\"width:5em\"|'''31xx'''<br />(DM)\n|-\n!style=\"width:5em\" rowspan=\"2\"|Numbers\n!style=\"width:5em\"|1st Order\n|align=center|3001<br/>:<br/>3061\n|align=center|4001<br/>:<br/>4061\n|align=center|4101<br/>:<br/>4161\n|align=center|3101<br/>:<br/>3161\n|-\n!2nd Order\n|align=center|3062<br/>:<br/>3079\n|align=center|4062<br/>:<br/>4079\n|align=center|4162<br/>:<br/>4179\n|align=center|3162<br/>:<br/>3179\n|}\n\n* DM \u2013 Driving Motor car\n* T \u2013 Trailer (non-powered) car\n\n==Announcer system==\nIn 2000\u20132001 the trains were retrofitted with an automated voice announcer system, featuring the voice of [[Emma Clarke]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Phillips |first= Rhodri |title= What Emma, outspoken 'Voice of the Underground', really thinks of Tube travellers |work =[[Daily Mail]] |location =London |date= 24 November 2007 |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-496165/What-Emma-outspoken-Voice-Underground--really-thinks-Tube-travellers.html}}</ref> Some of the announcements had to be changed in 2007 due to the arrival of the Eurostar at St Pancras and the London Overground.

The first prototype of the 2009 Stock was completed in 2007, and production trains were delivered from 2009 onwards. The first one entered service on 21 July 2009.\n\nIn January 2010, the first eight cars of 1967 Stock (3012+4012+4112+3112 and 3077+4077+4177+3177)<ref>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I0Twf6V8y1ZO8Zy0sqp6qVUw4X7HWvVJfeQuLpaQiKg/edit#gid=0</ref> were moved to [[C F Booth]] of [[Rotherham]] to be scrapped.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.rotherhamadvertiser.co.uk/news/85279/booth-wins-underground-trains-scrap-contract.aspx |title=Booth wins Underground trains scrap contract |work= Rotherham Advertiser |date=8 February 2010}}</ref> They had been used as a test train for several years.\n\nAfter 28 May 2011, 1967 Stock trains were no longer able to run to stations north of [[Seven Sisters station|Seven Sisters]], because of the commissioning of a new, incompatible signalling system (and decommissioning of the old one) between there and Walthamstow Central. The last 1967 stock train from Walthamstow Central was formed of units 3075 and 3078, running as set number 246.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe last-ever 1967 Stock train in passenger service on the remainder of the Victoria line (Brixton to Seven Sisters) ran on 30 June 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://londonist.com/2011/06/last-day-of-service-for-old-victoria-line-trains.php |title=Last Day Of Service For Old Victoria Line Trains |last=Nicholas |first=Dean |date=30 June 2011 |publisher=Londonist (blog) |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>\nThe last service departed Seven Sisters at 18:29, formed of cars 3159+4159+4059+3059 and 3179+4179+4079+3079, running as set number 247. After having reached Brixton, the train returned to Seven Sisters for the last time, arriving at approx 1950. Due to delays caused by other factors, it ran around 20 minutes late on its last run.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nMost cars were sent to [[C F Booth]] of [[Rotherham]] to be scrapped. However some units, particularly those which include 1972Mk1 cars, have been placed into storage at Eastleigh works, possibly as spare cars for the Bakerloo line. Two driving motor cars from the last run, 3079 and 3179, have been incorporated into the Asset Inspection Train. In addition to this, one four-car unit, 3160, remained in Northumberland Park depot.

Stock''' was a type of deep-level tube stock which operated on the [[Victoria line]] of the [[London Underground]] from when the line first opened on 1 September 1968 until 30 June 2011. Some of the stock was also used on the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] between [[Woodford tube station|Woodford]] and [[Hainault tube station|Hainault]] between 21 February 1968 and 1984, as the same [[automatic train operation]] (ATO) system was used on both lines.<ref>{{harvnb |Hardy |2002 |p=10}}</ref>\n\nA total of 316 cars (39.5 train sets) were built by [[Metro-Cammell]], and the stock was refurbished at [[Rosyth]].<ref>{{harvnb |Hardy |2002 |p=11}}</ref> Withdrawn cars of Mk I [[London Underground 1972 stock|1972 stock]] were later moved into the 1967 stock fleet in the 1990s, thus creating a fleet of 43 1967 stock trains. As they did not feature ATO, they were only used as non-driving cars, positioned in the middle of trains rather than at the ends. By the beginning of their retirement in 2010 the 1967 stock had achieved a [[mean distance between failures]] of over {{convert|14,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/Item04-RUP-7-7-2010-MD-report-LU.pdf|page=4|title=Managing Director's Report \u2013 London Underground|date=7 July 2010|publisher=Transport for London}}</ref>\n\nEach complete train consisted of two four-car units coupled together. Being ATO equipped, the train operator started the train by simultaneously pressing two buttons in the cab to start the automatic process. The trains were the first London Underground rolling stock to be built with wrap-around windows in the driving cabs.\n\nThe trains were maintained at [[Northumberland Park Depot]].\n\n==Background==\nLondon Transport had built a batch of 12 prototype motor cars, known as the [[London Underground 1960 Stock|1960 stock]], to test out a number of new features,<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=86}}</ref> and it was originally intended that these would form the basis for a production run to replace the ageing [[London Underground Standard Stock|Standard Stock]]. However, tube usage was increasing, and with the Standard Stock proving unreliable in these new circumstances, the decision was taken to build the [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 stock]], which was essentially the same as the earlier [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 stock]]. Metropolitan-Cammell, the manufacturers, built both classes on the same production line, without a break.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=91}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1962, after years of lobbying by London Transport, the government authorised the construction of the Victoria line, a completely new {{convert|10.5|mi|km|adj=on}} underground line running from [[Walthamstow Central station|Walthamstow]] to [[Victoria tube station|Victoria]]. Designs for the line included high levels of automation, and this included [[Automatic Train Operation]].{{sfn |Green|1987 |pp=58\u201359}} Trials were carried out on the [[District line]], and once it had been established that automatic train operation was feasible, a full-scale trial was run on the [[Woodford tube station|Woodford]] to [[Hainault tube station|Hainault]] section of the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]]. Five of the six trains of 1960 stock were modified,{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |p=93}} and automatic operation of the branch began on 5 April 1964. This enabled the system for the 1967 stock to be thoroughly tested,{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |p=95}} and early units of the stock were tested out on the branch.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=106}}\n\n==Design==\nThe 1967 Stock was the first opportunity to build cars which included many of the enhancements tried out in the 1960 Stock. They were designed for the Victoria line, and each train consisted of eight cars, marshalled as two four-car units. Each unit had a driving motor car at both ends, and two trailer cars between them. The outer ends of the motor cars were fitted with Wedglock automatic couplers, and all cars in a unit were semi-permanently coupled together. It was not expected that units would be uncoupled in service, and the arrangement on previous stock where uncoupling required simultaneous operations to be performed in both cabs was replaced by one where uncoupling could be initiated in the first car and completed afterwards in the second.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=96}}</ref>\n\nThe Victoria line was to be equipped for automatic operation, and the driver was replaced by a \"train operator\", with responsibility for shutting the doors, and then pressing two buttons simultaneously to start the train, after which the train would move under automatic control until the next station was reached.{{sfn |Glover |1996 |p=117}} However, a single controller to allow the trains to be driven manually in the depot or in emergency while in service was provided. This incorporated both traction control and braking. Door controls were provided in the cabs, and a facility to isolate either of the two units from the leading cab was also included. For the first time on tube stock, all control circuits were switched by cam-operated [[Miniature snap-action switch|micro-switches]]. They were used on the traction and brake controller, the disconnecting units, the fault isolating switches, the door controls and other control equipment, and resulted in a significant reduction in the routine electrical inspection needing to be carried out.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=97}}</ref>\n\n[[Dynamic braking|Rheostatic braking]] was used on the trains, and required amendments to the standard P.C.M. (Pneumatic Camshaft Motor) controllers, to include the switching in of the rheostats. When the train was to be stopped, rheostatic braking was used first, after which [[Railway air brake|friction brakes]] on the trailer cars were brought into action. If required, friction brakes on the motor cars could also be used. The rheostatic braking fades as the speed drops below {{convert|10|mph|kph}}, and so slow speed braking was always by friction brake. As on the 1960 Stock, traction was supplied by four motors, one on each axle. The motors on each [[bogie]] were wired in series permanently, and the traction controller performed series/parallel switching of the pairs of motors. The handbrake used hydraulic power to apply it, and then remained locked on until hydraulic pressure was used to release it.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |pp=97\u201398}}</ref>\n\nWindow design followed the 1960 Stock, consisting of two large windows between each set of doors, giving a double-glazed appearance. The doors opened into the gap between the inner and outer skins. However, on the doors themselves, the windows were curved, so that the top was much higher than previous designs, allowing passengers to see station signs without stooping. Visibility for the driver was improved by the provision of wrap-around cab windows. Loading times at stations were improved by providing a stand-back beside the doors, so that passengers standing near the doors did not block so much of the exit. Lighting was by [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent tube]], with two lights in each car fed from the battery through an invertor, so that they remained lit should the motor alternator shut down.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |pp=98\u201399}}</ref> Two types of motor alternator were used. Some were manufactured by [[Associated Electrical Industries|AEI]], and generated 230 V AC at 850&nbsp;Hz, which was stepped down to 115 V for the lighting and 58 V for the battery charger. The alternative was manufactured by [[English Electric]], and generated 60 V at 850&nbsp;Hz, which was stepped up for the lighting.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=103}}</ref>\n\nThe trains were the first in the system to be designed by an artistic designer (Professor [[Misha Black]]), rather than an engineer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Underground \u2013 Official Handbook|date=2000|author=Bayman, Bob|publisher=Capital Transport|page=66}}</ref>\n\n===Delivery===\nWhen first opened, the Victoria line terminated at [[London Victoria station|Victoria station]]. They were fitted with [[Automatic train operation]] (ATO) equipment, which had been tested on the Woodford to Hainault section of the Central line, using modified 1960 Stock trains. At first, trains were delivered to Ruislip Depot on the Piccadilly line. Following initial preparation for service, they were then transferred to Hainault Depot, where they ran as single units, so that the ATO equipment could be thoroughly tested. Once passed, they were taken to Leytonstone, from where [[London Underground battery-electric locomotives|battery locomotives]] were used to haul them over [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]] tracks to Northumberland Park Depot. After September 1968, when the first part of the Victoria line opened, trains were transferred from Ruislip to Northumberland Park directly, via a connecting link between the Piccadilly line and the Victoria line at Finsbury Park. Several four-car units were briefly transferred to operate the Woodford-Hainault service over the years, when the 1960 Stock units needed modification or overhaul.<ref name=bruce106>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=106}}</ref>\n\nThe extension of the Victoria line to [[Brixton tube station|Brixton]] required additional trains, and a further 18 four-car units were built. These were identical to the original units, and the numbering scheme followed on from where the first batch ended. Increasing traffic levels on the Victoria line during the 1980s eventually required more trains, which posed a problem, since no other stock could operate on the line, because of the need for it to operate automatically.<ref name=bruce106/> The [[London Underground 1972 Stock|1972 Mk I Stock]] was similar, although it was built to run as seven-car trains, with a four-car unit much like the 1967 stock, and a three-car unit consisting of a driving motor car, a trailer car, and an uncoupling non-driving motor car, which was a motor car with no cab for the driver. Instead it was fitted with a shunting control cabinet at the outer end. The main differences between the 1967 and the 1972 stock was that the latter was designed for two-man operation, having door controls for the guard at the trailing end of the driving motor cars, and that it was reversible, as it had been ordered for the Northern line, where the Kennington Loop can result in either end of the train facing the north end of the line.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=109}}</ref>\n\nHowever, most of the equipment was compatible with the 1967 stock, and so some of the 1972 stock was modified to work on the Victoria line. Two seven-car trains would be split up, and the uncoupling non-driving motors would be discarded, providing three four-car units. From an eight-car train, the outer motor cars would be removed, and used to replace the inner motor cars of an eight-car train of 1967 stock, releasing two motor cars fitted with ATO equipment, which would then be fitted to the outer ends of the 1972 stock.<ref name=bruce106/> The conversion work was carried out at Acton Works.<ref name=hardy18>{{harvnb |Hardy |1993 |p=18}}</ref> Fourteen driving motor and fourteen trailer cars were added to the Victoria line stock by this method between 1987 and 1989, and a further two driving motor cars and one trailer were added between 1995 and 1999.{{sfn |TfL |2007 |p=3}}\n\n===Automatic operation===\nThe system of automatic train operation developed for the Victoria line, and hence the 1967 Stock, used two types of coded signals, which were fed into the running rails, and pickup up by two independent sets of coils on the train. The first was the safety signalling system, which used a continuous signal encoded at 125&nbsp;Hz. This was used to pass codes at 420, 270 or 180 pulses per minute (ppm) to the control circuits. Failure to receive any of these codes resulted in the emergency brake operating. 180 ppm allowed the train to operate at speeds up to {{convert|25|mph|kph}} but did not allow power to be applied if it had previously been shut off. 270 ppm allowed the train to operate up to the same speed, but power could also be re-applied if it had previously been shut off. Finally, 420 ppm allowed the train to run at the speeds set by the driving command system, which was the second of the two coded message systems.<ref name=bruce107>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=107}}</ref>\n\nThe driving command system used short sections of the running rails, {{convert|10|ft|m|2}} long, which were called 'spots', and carried signals coded at between 1&nbsp;kHz and 20&nbsp;kHz. Running speeds were coded so that 100&nbsp;Hz represented {{convert|1|mph|kph}}, so a 3.5&nbsp;kHz spot indicated that the train should be travelling at {{convert|35|mph|kph}} and a 2&nbsp;kHz spot that it should be travelling at {{convert|20|mph|kph}}. In addition, a 15&nbsp;kHz spot indicated that the traction motors should be shut down, but the train allowed to coast, while a 20&nbsp;kHz spot indicated that the train should stop, as the next signal was at danger. When a train passed a speed control spot on the approach to a station, the brakes were applied at different rates, depending on whether the train was travelling faster or slower than the specified speed. Once the speed was below {{convert|4|mph|kph}}, the brakes were released slightly, to ensure a smooth stop, and the resting position would be within {{convert|5|ft|m}} of the desired stop point.<ref name=bruce107/>\n\nBraking spots were provided at {{convert|5|mph|kph|adj=on}} increments, from the expected maximum speed downwards, but if the train had been stopped at a signal by a 20&nbsp;kHz spot, for instance, the actual speed on approaching the station would be much slower, and the outer spots would be ignored. Speed control was by an electronic governor and a frequency generator mounted on one of the traction motors, with an overriding mechanical governor, connected to one of the axles on the trailer cars.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=110}}</ref> All trains were fitted with a fail-safe trip valve connected to the emergency brakes, and the mechanical governor operated this device if the speed exceeded {{convert|25|mph|kph}} when the 420 code was not being received, if the speed exceeded {{convert|50|mph|kph}} under any circumstances, or if the speed exceeded {{convert|11.5|mph|kph}} when the train was being operated in 'slow manual' mode. The trains could be driven manually at speeds up to {{convert|25|mph|kph}} if safety codes were still being received, or at {{convert|10|mph|kph}} if no codes were being received, either because of a failure or because the train was in the depot, where the tracks were not coded.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |pp=110, 112}}</ref>\n\n===Refurbishment===\nBeginning in 1989, all of the 43 8-car trains were taken to Acton Works, where they were fitted with passenger alarms, a public address system and other safety related features. The original hydraulic parking brakes were replaced by a new spring-operated brake. Following these changes, two units were selected for refurbishment, which was undertaken by Tickford Rail of Rosyth Royal Dockyard and Vic Berry of [[Leicester]]. The work included replacement of the seats, lighting, panelling and grab rails. Externally, the cars were painted in a red, white and blue livery. The two units resumed service on 9 October 1989, and in June 1990, a rolling programme to update all of the cars was awarded to Tickford Rail.<ref name=hardy18/> The work was completed in 1995.{{sfn |TfL |2007 |p=2}}\n\n==Roster==\nAs delivered, the numbering system composed of the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background-color:#ccc;\" colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n|colspan=\"4\"|<div style=\"float:left\">\u2190 [[Brixton tube station|Brixton]] (D)</div><div style=\"float:right\">[[Walthamstow Central station|Walthamstow]] (A) \u2192</div>\n|-style=\"border-top:solid 3px #{{LUL color|Victoria}};\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Formation\n|style=\"width:5em\"|'''30xx'''<br />(DM)\n|style=\"width:5em\"|'''40xx'''<br />(T)\n|style=\"width:5em\"|'''41xx'''<br />(T)\n|style=\"width:5em\"|'''31xx'''<br />(DM)\n|-\n!style=\"width:5em\" rowspan=\"2\"|Numbers\n!style=\"width:5em\"|1st Order\n|align=center|3001<br/>:<br/>3061\n|align=center|4001<br/>:<br/>4061\n|align=center|4101<br/>:<br/>4161\n|align=center|3101<br/>:<br/>3161\n|-\n!2nd Order\n|align=center|3062<br/>:<br/>3079\n|align=center|4062<br/>:<br/>4079\n|align=center|4162<br/>:<br/>4179\n|align=center|3162<br/>:<br/>3179\n|}\n\n* DM \u2013 Driving Motor car\n* T \u2013 Trailer (non-powered) car\n\n==Announcer system==\nIn 2000\u20132001 the trains were retrofitted with an automated voice announcer system, featuring the voice of [[Emma Clarke]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Phillips |first= Rhodri |title= What Emma, outspoken 'Voice of the Underground', really thinks of Tube travellers |work =[[Daily Mail]] |location =London |date= 24 November 2007 |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-496165/What-Emma-outspoken-Voice-Underground--really-thinks-Tube-travellers.html}}</ref> Some of the announcements had to be changed in 2007 due to the arrival of the Eurostar at St Pancras and the London Overground.

However some units, particularly those which include 1972Mk1 cars, have been placed into storage at Eastleigh works, possibly as spare cars for the Bakerloo line. Two driving motor cars from the last run, 3079 and 3179, have been incorporated into the Asset Inspection Train. In addition to this, one four-car unit, 3160, remained in Northumberland Park depot. It was used to shunt newly delivered trains of 2009 Stock, however now that these have all been delivered it has been moved. Another unit, 3067, is used to train cleaners, and can move between various depots to facilitate this.

The treaty of 1801 proved a beneficial arrangement for the East India Company as they gained access to Awadh's vast treasuries, repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. In addition, the revenues from running Awadh's armed forces brought them useful returns while the territory acted as a buffer state. The Nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with pomp and show.

Ron Rudzitis), guitarist Kevin Whitworth (ex-Crisis Party), bassist Tommy \"Bonehead\" Simpson (also ex-Crisis Party) and [[Mudhoney (band)|Mudhoney]] drummer [[Dan Peters]].  Their name came from a song of the same name by British [[punk rock|punk]] band the [[Buzzcocks]].\n\nBefore releasing their first single Peters left the group and was replaced by ex-[[Skin Yard]] drummer [[Jason Finn (musician)|Jason Finn]]. With this lineup the band released their debut single ''Between The Eyes'' for seminal [[Seattle]] record label [[Sub Pop]]. By 1990 Simpson had been replaced by ex-[[U-Men]] bassist Jim Tillman. With this lineup the band released their debut EP ''Between the Eyes'' in 1990, again on Sub Pop. This record was later expanded and released as their first full-length album in 1991. Following the ''Between The Eyes'' EP were the ''Foot'' singles and ''Out Of Focus'' EP. \n\nIn 1992 the band recorded and released ''[[Dayglo (album)|Dayglo]]''. In the Sub Pop catalog, ''Dayglo'' was listed as \"Blotter not included\" a play on \"Batteries not included\" instead referring to LSD. Soon after, Tillman left to pursue other interests. He was replaced at first by original bassist Tommy Simpson, who in turn was replaced by ex-[[Green River (band)|Green River]] and [[Mother Love Bone]] guitarist [[Bruce Fairweather]].\n\nIn 1993 the ''Far Gone'' album appeared, which to many was considered a disappointment following ''Dayglo'''s critical success. Initially ''Far Gone'' was to be released by [[PolyGram Records]] but due to contractual problems with Sub Pop Records,  ''Far Gone'' was dumped by the major label. Instead an inferior 'rough mix' of the album was released by Sub Pop, a problem which Love Battery planned to rectify by remixing and reissuing but never did. \n\nFollowing the ''Far Gone'' fiasco, Love Battery signed with Atlas Records in 1994 releasing the ''Nehru Jacket'' EP late in the year. It contained 2 songs that also found their way onto 1995's ''Straight Freak Ticket'' album which was also released on Atlas in 1995. The label failed to promote the band and album properly however which resulted in poor sales. Shortly thereafter Finn left the group to join [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]] who quickly found success later in the year. \n\nA prolonged period of uncertainty ensued following Finn's departure with an array of drummers brought in as his replacement including original drummer Dan Peters and ex-[[The Posies|Posies]] and [[Fastbacks]] drummer Mike Musburger. The band practically disappeared until the release of their fifth album [[Confusion Au Go Go]] in 1999. This time around drummers Peters, Musburger and Finn all contributed to the album although Peters took on a majority of the work.\n\nFollowing the release of [[Confusion Au Go Go]] Love Battery remained for the most part quiet. A few one off performances were made in 2002 featuring Tommy Simpson returning on bass and Finn and Peters on drums. After a prolonged period of inactivity the band played their first show in 4 years on June 23, 2006 at Neumo's in Seattle, WA. The current lineup consists of Nine, Whitworth, Simpson and Musburger.\n\nIn 1996 Love Battery was featured in the documentary [[Hype!]], chronicling the rise of the Seattle \"grunge\" music scene. A clip is shown of a live performance of \"Between the Eyes.\"\n\nA video for \"Out Of Focus\" appears on ''Sub Pop Video Network Program, Volume Two''. They also made videos for \"Fuzz Factory\" and \"Harold's Pink Room\" from the ''Straight Freak Ticket'' album. The \"Fuzz Factory\" video was shot in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and featured the band driving around in a white Cadillac convertible, hinting at [[Hunter S.

Ron Rudzitis), guitarist Kevin Whitworth (ex-Crisis Party), bassist Tommy \"Bonehead\" Simpson (also ex-Crisis Party) and [[Mudhoney (band)|Mudhoney]] drummer [[Dan Peters]].  Their name came from a song of the same name by British [[punk rock|punk]] band the [[Buzzcocks]].\n\nBefore releasing their first single Peters left the group and was replaced by ex-[[Skin Yard]] drummer [[Jason Finn (musician)|Jason Finn]]. With this lineup the band released their debut single ''Between The Eyes'' for seminal [[Seattle]] record label [[Sub Pop]]. By 1990 Simpson had been replaced by ex-[[U-Men]] bassist Jim Tillman. With this lineup the band released their debut EP ''Between the Eyes'' in 1990, again on Sub Pop. This record was later expanded and released as their first full-length album in 1991. Following the ''Between The Eyes'' EP were the ''Foot'' singles and ''Out Of Focus'' EP. \n\nIn 1992 the band recorded and released ''[[Dayglo (album)|Dayglo]]''. In the Sub Pop catalog, ''Dayglo'' was listed as \"Blotter not included\" a play on \"Batteries not included\" instead referring to LSD. Soon after, Tillman left to pursue other interests. He was replaced at first by original bassist Tommy Simpson, who in turn was replaced by ex-[[Green River (band)|Green River]] and [[Mother Love Bone]] guitarist [[Bruce Fairweather]].\n\nIn 1993 the ''Far Gone'' album appeared, which to many was considered a disappointment following ''Dayglo'''s critical success. Initially ''Far Gone'' was to be released by [[PolyGram Records]] but due to contractual problems with Sub Pop Records,  ''Far Gone'' was dumped by the major label. Instead an inferior 'rough mix' of the album was released by Sub Pop, a problem which Love Battery planned to rectify by remixing and reissuing but never did. \n\nFollowing the ''Far Gone'' fiasco, Love Battery signed with Atlas Records in 1994 releasing the ''Nehru Jacket'' EP late in the year. It contained 2 songs that also found their way onto 1995's ''Straight Freak Ticket'' album which was also released on Atlas in 1995. The label failed to promote the band and album properly however which resulted in poor sales. Shortly thereafter Finn left the group to join [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]] who quickly found success later in the year. \n\nA prolonged period of uncertainty ensued following Finn's departure with an array of drummers brought in as his replacement including original drummer Dan Peters and ex-[[The Posies|Posies]] and [[Fastbacks]] drummer Mike Musburger. The band practically disappeared until the release of their fifth album [[Confusion Au Go Go]] in 1999. This time around drummers Peters, Musburger and Finn all contributed to the album although Peters took on a majority of the work.\n\nFollowing the release of [[Confusion Au Go Go]] Love Battery remained for the most part quiet. A few one off performances were made in 2002 featuring Tommy Simpson returning on bass and Finn and Peters on drums. After a prolonged period of inactivity the band played their first show in 4 years on June 23, 2006 at Neumo's in Seattle, WA. The current lineup consists of Nine, Whitworth, Simpson and Musburger.\n\nIn 1996 Love Battery was featured in the documentary [[Hype!]], chronicling the rise of the Seattle \"grunge\" music scene. A clip is shown of a live performance of \"Between the Eyes.\"\n\nA video for \"Out Of Focus\" appears on ''Sub Pop Video Network Program, Volume Two''. They also made videos for \"Fuzz Factory\" and \"Harold's Pink Room\" from the ''Straight Freak Ticket'' album. The \"Fuzz Factory\" video was shot in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and featured the band driving around in a white Cadillac convertible, hinting at [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s famous book, ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (novel)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' years before the film of the same name starring actor [[Johnny Depp]] was released.\n\nLove Battery leader Ron Nine also plays in new band Down With People who have been significantly more active than Love Battery as of late. As of 2010 Ron Nine, former members of Love Battery and Tad bassist Kurt Danielson play in a band called Vaporland. \n\nIn 2011, Love Battery reunited amidst the individual members' other projects to perform at The Mix in [[Seattle, Washington]] on October 22nd. \n\n2012 marked a new start for the band, as they reunited to perform in venues such as LoFi Performance Gallery on May 19th, the Mural Amphitheatre in Seattle on August 20th and the Comet Tavern on September 29th alongside artists such as [[Atomic Bride]], [[Summer Babes]] and [[Blood Orange Paradise]].

When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n===Settings===\n====The Tower====\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the manhwa, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n====Shinsu====\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n====Positions====\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer (Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer (Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout (Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller (Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Media==\n===Manhwa===\nLee Jong-hui launched ''Tower of God'' in Naver's webtoon platform [[Naver Webtoon]] on June 30, 2010.<ref name=\"H131017\">{{cite news |last=Lim |first=Jiseon |date=October 17, 2013 |script-title=ko:0.03%\uc758 \ud655\ub960\u2026\u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1\u2019 \uc313\uc740 \u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \uc190\u2019 |trans-title=0.03% probability, build a \u2018Tower of God\u2019 by \u2018Hand of God\u2019 |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/book/607516.html |language=ko |newspaper=Hani.co.kr |location=Frankfurt |publisher=The Hankyoreh |accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref> Its first and second [[trade paperback (comics)|collected volume]]s was released simultaneously by Young Com on November 12, 2019.<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=1191157424490549248|user=iyoungcom_2|script-title=ko:\ud83c\udf89\ub4dc\ub514\uc5b4 <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> 1, 2\uad8c\uc774 \ub3d9\uc2dc \ucd9c\uac04\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4!!\ud83c\udf89  <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> \ucd9c\uac04\uc744 \uae30\ub150\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b8\uc704\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4!\ud83d\udc95  \ubcf8 \uac8c\uc2dc\ubb3c\uc744 RT + \ud314\ub85c\uc6b0 \ud574\uc8fc\uc2e0 \ubd84\ub4e4 \uc911 3\ubd84\uc744 \ucd94\ucca8\ud558\uc5ec <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> 1\uad8c\uc744 \ubcf4\ub0b4\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4!  \ub9ce\uc740 \ucc38\uc5ec \ubd80\ud0c1\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4~\ud83d\ude0d|language=ko|date=November 4, 2019|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Tower of God'' was the first manhwa and one of the first webtoons to receive official translations by Line Webtoon in 2014, and all unofficial fan translations have since been terminated.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Irregular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = 3/400 (Three Four-Hundredths)\n| TranslitTitle       = Yonhyaku-bun no San\n| NativeTitle         = 400\u5206\u306e\uff13\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary        = Bam finds himself surrounded by two other test-takers, Khun and Rak, with the former being a blue-haired boy with a cunning look and the latter a giant anthropomorphic crocodilian. Khun finds interest with Bam since he is carrying the Black March and decides to form an alliance with him. With half the fighters dead, the next request is announced: to find a total of three members to team up with and touch by the end of the countdown. With Rak as the only living being nearby, Bam and Khun try to convince him to join their alliance, but Rak doesn't care and just wants to fight Bam with his weapon. Seeing no other option, they forcefully hold onto him at the last second of the countdown. On the mothership, test administrator Lero Ro's challenge for those remaining is to pass his Shinsu water barrier. All but Bam, who remains standing to his supposed good luck, are pushed back by the Shinsu, but most are eventually able to cross through the barrier. The victors are taken to another room where the third test will take place.

When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n===Settings===\n====The Tower====\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the manhwa, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n====Shinsu====\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n====Positions====\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer (Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer (Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout (Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller (Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Media==\n===Manhwa===\nLee Jong-hui launched ''Tower of God'' in Naver's webtoon platform [[Naver Webtoon]] on June 30, 2010.<ref name=\"H131017\">{{cite news |last=Lim |first=Jiseon |date=October 17, 2013 |script-title=ko:0.03%\uc758 \ud655\ub960\u2026\u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1\u2019 \uc313\uc740 \u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \uc190\u2019 |trans-title=0.03% probability, build a \u2018Tower of God\u2019 by \u2018Hand of God\u2019 |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/book/607516.html |language=ko |newspaper=Hani.co.kr |location=Frankfurt |publisher=The Hankyoreh |accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref> Its first and second [[trade paperback (comics)|collected volume]]s was released simultaneously by Young Com on November 12, 2019.<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=1191157424490549248|user=iyoungcom_2|script-title=ko:\ud83c\udf89\ub4dc\ub514\uc5b4 <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> 1, 2\uad8c\uc774 \ub3d9\uc2dc \ucd9c\uac04\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4!!\ud83c\udf89  <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> \ucd9c\uac04\uc744 \uae30\ub150\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b8\uc704\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4!\ud83d\udc95  \ubcf8 \uac8c\uc2dc\ubb3c\uc744 RT + \ud314\ub85c\uc6b0 \ud574\uc8fc\uc2e0 \ubd84\ub4e4 \uc911 3\ubd84\uc744 \ucd94\ucca8\ud558\uc5ec <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> 1\uad8c\uc744 \ubcf4\ub0b4\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4!  \ub9ce\uc740 \ucc38\uc5ec \ubd80\ud0c1\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4~\ud83d\ude0d|language=ko|date=November 4, 2019|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Tower of God'' was the first manhwa and one of the first webtoons to receive official translations by Line Webtoon in 2014, and all unofficial fan translations have since been terminated.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Irregular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = 3/400 (Three Four-Hundredths)\n| TranslitTitle       = Yonhyaku-bun no San\n| NativeTitle         = 400\u5206\u306e\uff13\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary        = Bam finds himself surrounded by two other test-takers, Khun and Rak, with the former being a blue-haired boy with a cunning look and the latter a giant anthropomorphic crocodilian. Khun finds interest with Bam since he is carrying the Black March and decides to form an alliance with him. With half the fighters dead, the next request is announced: to find a total of three members to team up with and touch by the end of the countdown. With Rak as the only living being nearby, Bam and Khun try to convince him to join their alliance, but Rak doesn't care and just wants to fight Bam with his weapon. Seeing no other option, they forcefully hold onto him at the last second of the countdown. On the mothership, test administrator Lero Ro's challenge for those remaining is to pass his Shinsu water barrier. All but Bam, who remains standing to his supposed good luck, are pushed back by the Shinsu, but most are eventually able to cross through the barrier. The victors are taken to another room where the third test will take place.

It defines geodetic [[latitude]] 90\u00b0 North, as well as the direction of [[true north]]. At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of [[longitude]] converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. Along tight latitude circles, counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west. The North Pole is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere.

Since 2002, the Russians have also annually established a base, [[Barneo]], close to the Pole. This operates for a few weeks during early spring.

Reuters</ref> to the late 21st century or later.\n\nAttempts to reach the North Pole began in the late 19th century, with the record for \"[[Farthest North]]\" being surpassed on numerous occasions. The first undisputed expedition to reach the North Pole was that of the airship ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]'', which overflew the area in 1926 with 16 men on board, including expedition leader [[Roald Amundsen]]. Three prior expeditions \u2013 led by [[Frederick Cook]] (1908, land), [[Robert Peary]] (1909, land) and [[Richard E. Byrd]] (1926, aerial) \u2013 were once also accepted as having reached the Pole. However, in each case later analysis of expedition data has cast doubt upon the accuracy of their claims. \n\n==Precise definition==\n{{See also|Polar motion}}\nThe Earth's axis of rotation&nbsp;\u2013 and hence the position of the North Pole&nbsp;\u2013 was commonly believed to be fixed (relative to the surface of the Earth) until, in the 18th century, the mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] predicted that the axis might \"wobble\" slightly. Around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent \"variation of latitude\", as determined for a fixed point on Earth from the observation of stars. Part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the Pole across the Earth's surface, by a range of a few metres. The wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component. The component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the eight-month wandering predicted by Euler and is now called the [[Chandler wobble]] after its discoverer. The exact point of intersection of the Earth's axis and the Earth's surface, at any given moment, is called the \"instantaneous pole\", but because of the \"wobble\" this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed North Pole (or South Pole) when metre-scale precision is required.\n\nIt is desirable to tie the system of Earth coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevations or [[orography]]) to fixed landforms. However, given [[plate tectonics]] and [[isostasy]], there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed. Yet the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] and the [[International Astronomical Union]] have defined a framework called the [[International Terrestrial Reference System]].\n\n==Exploration==\n{{See also|Arctic exploration|Farthest North|List of Arctic expeditions|List of firsts in the Geographic North Pole}}\n\n===Pre-1900===\n[[File:Mercator north pole 1595.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Gerardus Mercator]]'s map of the North Pole from 1595]]\n[[File:C.G.

Several expeditions set out to find the way, generally with whaling ships, already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes.\n\nOne of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the North Pole was that of British naval officer [[William Parry (explorer)|William Edward Parry]], who in 1827 reached latitude 82\u00b045\u2032 North. In 1871, the [[Polaris expedition]], a US attempt on the Pole led by [[Charles Francis Hall]], ended in disaster. Another British [[Royal Navy]] attempt to get to the pole, part of the [[British Arctic Expedition]], by Commander [[Albert Hastings Markham|Albert H. Markham]] reached a then-record 83\u00b020'26\" North in May 1876 before turning back. An 1879\u20131881 expedition commanded by [[United States Navy|US naval]] officer [[George W. DeLong]] ended tragically when their ship, the [[USS Jeannette (1878)|USS ''Jeanette'']], was crushed by ice. Over half the crew, including DeLong, were lost.\n\n[[File:Nansen-fram.jpg|thumb|left|Nansen's ship ''Fram'' in the Arctic ice]]\nIn April 1895, the Norwegian explorers [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and [[Hjalmar Johansen]] struck out for the Pole on skis after leaving Nansen's icebound ship ''[[Fram]]''. The pair reached latitude 86\u00b014\u2032 North before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards, eventually reaching [[Franz Josef Land]].\n\nIn 1897, Swedish engineer [[Salomon August Andr\u00e9e]] and two companions tried to reach the North Pole in the hydrogen balloon ''\u00d6rnen'' (\"Eagle\"), but came down {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Kvit\u00f8ya]], the northeasternmost part of the [[Svalbard]] archipelago. They trekked to Kvit\u00f8ya but died there three months later.  In 1930 the remains of [[S. A. Andr\u00e9e's Arctic Balloon Expedition of 1897|this expedition]] were found by the Norwegian [[Bratvaag Expedition]].\n\nThe Italian explorer [[Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi|Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi]] and Captain [[Umberto Cagni]] of the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (Regia Marina) sailed the converted whaler ''[[Jason (ship)|Stella Polare]]'' (\"Pole Star\") from Norway in 1899. On 11 March 1900, Cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86\u00b0 34\u2019 on 25 April, setting a new record by beating Nansen's result of 1895 by {{convert|35|to|40|km|abbr=on}}. Cagni barely managed to return to the camp, remaining there until 23 June. On 16 August, the ''Stella Polare'' left [[Rudolf Island]] heading south and the expedition returned to Norway.\n\n===1900\u20131940===\n[[File:Peary Sledge Party and Flags at the Pole.jpg|thumb|Peary's sledge party at what they claimed was the North Pole, 1909.

However, Peary's claim remains highly disputed and controversial. Those who accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in [Western] navigation, and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole.\n\nThe distances and speeds that Peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people, almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point. Peary's account of a journey to the Pole and back while traveling along the direct line&nbsp;\u2013 the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing&nbsp;\u2013 is contradicted by Henson's account of tortuous detours to avoid [[Pressure ridge (ice)|pressure ridge]]s and [[Lead (sea ice)|open lead]]s.\n\nThe  British explorer [[Wally Herbert]], initially a supporter of Peary, researched Peary's records in 1989 and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorer's navigational records. He concluded that Peary had not reached the Pole.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-wally-herbert-453324.html |title=Sir Wally Herbert |work=The Independent |date=16 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224045237/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-wally-herbert-453324.html |archivedate=24 December 2008 }}</ref> Support for Peary came again in 2005, however, when British explorer [[Tom Avery]] and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary's journey with replica wooden sleds and [[Canadian Eskimo Dog]] teams, reaching the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours&nbsp;\u2013 nearly five hours faster than Peary. However, Avery's fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles, significantly short of the 135 claimed by Peary. Avery writes on his web site that \"The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from [[Cape Columbia]].

From the Pole, they travelled towards Svalbard but, due to the unstable nature of the ice, ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99 days. They were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship ''MV Benjamin Bowring'' and boarded it on 4 August 1982 at position 80:31N 00:59W. As a result of this journey, which formed a section of the three-year [[Transglobe Expedition]] 1979\u20131982, Fiennes and Burton became the first people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both North and South Poles, by surface travel alone.

For example, the flight from [[Chicago]] to [[Beijing]] may come close as latitude 89\u00b0 N, though because of prevailing winds return journeys go over the [[Bering Strait]].  In recent years journeys to the North Pole by air (landing by helicopter or on a runway prepared on the ice) or by icebreaker have become relatively routine, and are even available to small groups of tourists through [[Adventure travel|adventure holiday]] companies. Parachute jumps have frequently been made onto the North Pole in recent years. The temporary seasonal Russian camp of [[Barneo]] has been established by air a short distance from the Pole annually since 2002, and caters for scientific researchers as well as tourist parties.

The expedition was totally self-dependent and used no external supplies. The expedition was supported by the [[Russian Geographical Society]].<ref name=\"yemelya.ru\">[http://www.yemelya.ru/diary2013_en.php?lnk=2013 \"Diary of MLAE-2013\"]. ''yemelya.ru''.</ref>\n\n==Day and night==\nThe sun at the North Pole is continuously [[Midnight sun|above the horizon]] during the summer and continuously [[Polar night|below the horizon]] during the winter. [[Sunrise]] is just before the [[March equinox]] (around 20 March); the sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23\u00bd\u00b0 elevation at the summer [[solstice]] (around 21 June), after which time it begins to sink, reaching [[sunset]] just after the [[September equinox]] (around 23 September). When the sun is visible in the polar sky, it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon. This circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation (in degrees) above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox. Hence the North and South Poles experience the slowest rates of sunrise and sunset on Earth.\n\nThe [[twilight]] period which occurs before sunrise and after sunset has three different definitions :\n* a [[Twilight#Civil twilight|civil twilight]] period of about two weeks ;\n* a [[Twilight#Nautical twilight|nautical twilight]] period of about five weeks ;\n* an [[Twilight#Astronomical twilight|astronomical twilight]] period of about seven weeks.\n\nThese effects are caused by a combination of the Earth's [[axial tilt]] and its revolution around the sun. The direction of the Earth's axial tilt, as well as its angle relative to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the sun, remains very nearly constant over the course of a year (both change very slowly over long time periods). At northern midsummer the North Pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent. As the year progresses and the Earth moves around the sun, the North Pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the Sun to its maximum extent. A similar sequence is observed at the South Pole, with a six-month time difference.\n\n==Time==\nIn most places on Earth, local time is determined by longitude, such that the time of day is more or less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky (for example, at midday the sun is roughly at its highest). This line of reasoning fails at the North Pole, where the sun rises and sets only once per year, and all lines of longitude, and hence all time zones, converge. There is no permanent human presence at the North Pole and no particular time zone has been assigned. Polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient, such as [[Greenwich Mean Time]], or the time zone of the country from which they departed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic ice shrinkage]]s of 2007 compared to 2005 and also compared to the 1979\u20132000 average.]]\n{{main|Climate of the Arctic}}\n{{See also|Climate change in the Arctic}}\nThe North Pole is substantially warmer than the [[South Pole]] because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean (which acts as a reservoir of heat), rather than at altitude on a continental land mass.

It defines geodetic [[latitude]] 90\u00b0 North, as well as the direction of [[true north]]. At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of [[longitude]] converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. Along tight latitude circles, counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west. The North Pole is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere. The nearest land is usually said to be [[Kaffeklubben Island]], off the northern coast of [[Greenland]] about {{convert|700|km|abbr=on}} away, though some perhaps semi-permanent gravel banks lie slightly closer.

Reuters</ref> to the late 21st century or later.\n\nAttempts to reach the North Pole began in the late 19th century, with the record for \"[[Farthest North]]\" being surpassed on numerous occasions. The first undisputed expedition to reach the North Pole was that of the airship ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]'', which overflew the area in 1926 with 16 men on board, including expedition leader [[Roald Amundsen]]. Three prior expeditions \u2013 led by [[Frederick Cook]] (1908, land), [[Robert Peary]] (1909, land) and [[Richard E. Byrd]] (1926, aerial) \u2013 were once also accepted as having reached the Pole. However, in each case later analysis of expedition data has cast doubt upon the accuracy of their claims. \n\n==Precise definition==\n{{See also|Polar motion}}\nThe Earth's axis of rotation&nbsp;\u2013 and hence the position of the North Pole&nbsp;\u2013 was commonly believed to be fixed (relative to the surface of the Earth) until, in the 18th century, the mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] predicted that the axis might \"wobble\" slightly. Around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent \"variation of latitude\", as determined for a fixed point on Earth from the observation of stars. Part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the Pole across the Earth's surface, by a range of a few metres. The wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component. The component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the eight-month wandering predicted by Euler and is now called the [[Chandler wobble]] after its discoverer. The exact point of intersection of the Earth's axis and the Earth's surface, at any given moment, is called the \"instantaneous pole\", but because of the \"wobble\" this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed North Pole (or South Pole) when metre-scale precision is required.\n\nIt is desirable to tie the system of Earth coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevations or [[orography]]) to fixed landforms. However, given [[plate tectonics]] and [[isostasy]], there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed. Yet the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] and the [[International Astronomical Union]] have defined a framework called the [[International Terrestrial Reference System]].\n\n==Exploration==\n{{See also|Arctic exploration|Farthest North|List of Arctic expeditions|List of firsts in the Geographic North Pole}}\n\n===Pre-1900===\n[[File:Mercator north pole 1595.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Gerardus Mercator]]'s map of the North Pole from 1595]]\n[[File:C.G.

Several expeditions set out to find the way, generally with whaling ships, already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes.\n\nOne of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the North Pole was that of British naval officer [[William Parry (explorer)|William Edward Parry]], who in 1827 reached latitude 82\u00b045\u2032 North. In 1871, the [[Polaris expedition]], a US attempt on the Pole led by [[Charles Francis Hall]], ended in disaster. Another British [[Royal Navy]] attempt to get to the pole, part of the [[British Arctic Expedition]], by Commander [[Albert Hastings Markham|Albert H. Markham]] reached a then-record 83\u00b020'26\" North in May 1876 before turning back. An 1879\u20131881 expedition commanded by [[United States Navy|US naval]] officer [[George W. DeLong]] ended tragically when their ship, the [[USS Jeannette (1878)|USS ''Jeanette'']], was crushed by ice. Over half the crew, including DeLong, were lost.\n\n[[File:Nansen-fram.jpg|thumb|left|Nansen's ship ''Fram'' in the Arctic ice]]\nIn April 1895, the Norwegian explorers [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and [[Hjalmar Johansen]] struck out for the Pole on skis after leaving Nansen's icebound ship ''[[Fram]]''. The pair reached latitude 86\u00b014\u2032 North before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards, eventually reaching [[Franz Josef Land]].\n\nIn 1897, Swedish engineer [[Salomon August Andr\u00e9e]] and two companions tried to reach the North Pole in the hydrogen balloon ''\u00d6rnen'' (\"Eagle\"), but came down {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Kvit\u00f8ya]], the northeasternmost part of the [[Svalbard]] archipelago. They trekked to Kvit\u00f8ya but died there three months later.  In 1930 the remains of [[S. A. Andr\u00e9e's Arctic Balloon Expedition of 1897|this expedition]] were found by the Norwegian [[Bratvaag Expedition]].\n\nThe Italian explorer [[Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi|Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi]] and Captain [[Umberto Cagni]] of the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (Regia Marina) sailed the converted whaler ''[[Jason (ship)|Stella Polare]]'' (\"Pole Star\") from Norway in 1899. On 11 March 1900, Cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86\u00b0 34\u2019 on 25 April, setting a new record by beating Nansen's result of 1895 by {{convert|35|to|40|km|abbr=on}}. Cagni barely managed to return to the camp, remaining there until 23 June. On 16 August, the ''Stella Polare'' left [[Rudolf Island]] heading south and the expedition returned to Norway.\n\n===1900\u20131940===\n[[File:Peary Sledge Party and Flags at the Pole.jpg|thumb|Peary's sledge party at what they claimed was the North Pole, 1909.

However, Peary's claim remains highly disputed and controversial. Those who accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in [Western] navigation, and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole.\n\nThe distances and speeds that Peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people, almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point. Peary's account of a journey to the Pole and back while traveling along the direct line&nbsp;\u2013 the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing&nbsp;\u2013 is contradicted by Henson's account of tortuous detours to avoid [[Pressure ridge (ice)|pressure ridge]]s and [[Lead (sea ice)|open lead]]s.\n\nThe  British explorer [[Wally Herbert]], initially a supporter of Peary, researched Peary's records in 1989 and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorer's navigational records.

The expedition was totally self-dependent and used no external supplies. The expedition was supported by the [[Russian Geographical Society]].<ref name=\"yemelya.ru\">[http://www.yemelya.ru/diary2013_en.php?lnk=2013 \"Diary of MLAE-2013\"]. ''yemelya.ru''.</ref>\n\n==Day and night==\nThe sun at the North Pole is continuously [[Midnight sun|above the horizon]] during the summer and continuously [[Polar night|below the horizon]] during the winter. [[Sunrise]] is just before the [[March equinox]] (around 20 March); the sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23\u00bd\u00b0 elevation at the summer [[solstice]] (around 21 June), after which time it begins to sink, reaching [[sunset]] just after the [[September equinox]] (around 23 September). When the sun is visible in the polar sky, it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon. This circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation (in degrees) above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox. Hence the North and South Poles experience the slowest rates of sunrise and sunset on Earth.\n\nThe [[twilight]] period which occurs before sunrise and after sunset has three different definitions :\n* a [[Twilight#Civil twilight|civil twilight]] period of about two weeks ;\n* a [[Twilight#Nautical twilight|nautical twilight]] period of about five weeks ;\n* an [[Twilight#Astronomical twilight|astronomical twilight]] period of about seven weeks.\n\nThese effects are caused by a combination of the Earth's [[axial tilt]] and its revolution around the sun. The direction of the Earth's axial tilt, as well as its angle relative to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the sun, remains very nearly constant over the course of a year (both change very slowly over long time periods). At northern midsummer the North Pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent. As the year progresses and the Earth moves around the sun, the North Pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the Sun to its maximum extent. A similar sequence is observed at the South Pole, with a six-month time difference.\n\n==Time==\nIn most places on Earth, local time is determined by longitude, such that the time of day is more or less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky (for example, at midday the sun is roughly at its highest). This line of reasoning fails at the North Pole, where the sun rises and sets only once per year, and all lines of longitude, and hence all time zones, converge. There is no permanent human presence at the North Pole and no particular time zone has been assigned. Polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient, such as [[Greenwich Mean Time]], or the time zone of the country from which they departed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic ice shrinkage]]s of 2007 compared to 2005 and also compared to the 1979\u20132000 average.]]\n{{main|Climate of the Arctic}}\n{{See also|Climate change in the Arctic}}\nThe North Pole is substantially warmer than the [[South Pole]] because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean (which acts as a reservoir of heat), rather than at altitude on a continental land mass.

Freedom of the press in Norway dates back to the [[Constitution of Norway|constitution]] of 1814. Most of the Norwegian press is privately owned and self-regulated; however, the state provides [[press support]].\n\n== Television ==\n{{Main|Television in Norway}}\n\nThe two companies dominating the Norwegian terrestrial broadcast television are the governmental owned [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]] (with four main services, [[NRK1]], [[NRK2]], [[NRK3]] and [[NRK Super]]) and [[TV 2 (Norway)|TV2]] (with [[TV 2 Filmkanalen]], [[TV 2 Nyhetskanalen]], [[TV 2 Sport (Norway)|TV 2 Sport]], [[TV 2 Zebra]] and [[TV 2 Livsstil]]). Other, long-running channels are [[TVNorge]] and [[TV3 (Norway)|TV3]].\n\n== Radio ==\n{{main|List of Norwegian-language radio stations}}\nNational radio is dominated by the public-service company [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]], which is funded from the [[television licence|television licence fee]] payable by the owners of television sets. NRK provides programming on three radio channels \u2013 [[NRK P1]], [[NRK P2]], and [[NRK P3]] \u2013 broadcast on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and via [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]]. A number of further specialist channels are broadcast exclusively on DAB, [[DVB-T]], and [[Internet radio|the internet]] including Radio Norway Direct Norway's new English language Radio Station.\n\nAdditionally, there are a number of commercial radio stations as well as local radio stations run by various non-profit organizations.\n\n== Social media==\n{{Main|Social media}}\nAs of August 2009, it was estimated that 1,156,000 Norwegians use [[Facebook]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.journalisten.no/story/58279|title=68.000 p\u00e5 Twitter|last=Jensen|first=Martin Huseby|date=7 August 2009|work=Klassekampen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=9 October 2009}}</ref> For comparison, the total number of inhabitants is about 4,830,000.\n\n== Institutions ==\nInstitutions within organized labour are the [[Norwegian Union of Journalists]], the [[Association of Norwegian Editors]] and the [[Norwegian Media Businesses' Association]]\u2014these are organized in the umbrella [[Norwegian Press Association]]. The Press Association is responsible for [[Pressens Faglige Utvalg]], which oversees the [[Ethical Code of Practice for the Norwegian Press]].

He also expressed concern that journalists who sympathise with the Progress Party may have a lesser chance to get hired than journalists with political sympathies close to editors.<ref name=\"loset\">{{cite news|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/politikk/redaktoerer-vil-ha-jens-1769680.html|work=TV2|title=Redakt\u00f8rer vil ha Jens|first=Kjetil|last=L\u00f8set|date=18 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nFor instance, in the actual [[2009 Norwegian parliamentary election|2009 election]], the Progress Party received 41 mandates, while by journalists it would have received none. The Christian Democratic Party and Center Party would also have been left without representation, while the revolutionary socialist party Red would enter parliament with 9 mandates. The Socialist Left and Liberal Party would also receive significant gains.<ref name=\"aarebrot\"/> In 2003, as much as 36% of Norwegian journalists said they would vote for the Socialist Left Party alone, with only 25% saying that they would vote for any of the right-of-center Liberal, Christian Democratic, Conservative or Progress Party combined.<ref name=\"loset\"/> News commentator [[Frank Rossavik]] once said that if a journalist would stand forward as a Progress Party voter, it would have been \"social suicide\", and more devastating than withdrawing from the Norwegian Union of Journalists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bt.no/meninger/kommentar/rossavik/article402128.ece?start=2|work=Bergens Tidende|title=Venstrevridde journalister|first=Frank|last=Rossavik|date=30 August 2007|access-date=9 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910133121/http://www.bt.no/meninger/kommentar/rossavik/article402128.ece?start=2|archive-date=10 September 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nNorwegian editors have as well been proven to have leftist political views, with a 2008 survey showing that the Labour Party would have been given a majority in parliament alone with 85 representatives.<ref name=\"loset\"/>\n\nThe notion of political bias based on the sum of individuals' party selection has been criticized. Among others, conservative historian and politician [[Francis Sejersted]] holds that the general media is neither left-slanted nor right-slanted, but \"media-slanted\". This means that media across the political spectrum have a tendency to choose the same angle on a case, focusing on personification and dramatic events.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/artikler/kultur_medier/9931/article/item/null|title=Konserntrusselen|last=Nore|first=Aslak|date=3 March 2004|work=Klassekampen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=9 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135324/http://www.klassekampen.no/artikler/kultur_medier/9931/article/item/null|archivedate=17 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Communications in Norway]]\n*[[Culture of Norway]]\n*[[Internet in Norway]]\n* [[Open access in Norway]]\n\n;Lists\n*[[List of Norwegian newspapers]]\n*[[List of Norwegian magazines]]\n*[[List of Norwegian television channels]]\n*[[List of Norwegian-language radio stations]]\n*[[List of Norwegian writers]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n===in English===\n* {{cite book|title=Europa World Year Book |publisher=[[Europa Publications]] |isbn=978-1-85743-255-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gP_-8rXzQs8C |year=2004\n|chapter=Norway: Press\n}}\n* {{cite book|editor1=Euromedia Research Group |editor2=Mary Kelly|display-editors=etal|title= Media in Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KRfXsBUBeAC|publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |isbn=978-0-7619-4132-3 |edition=3rd |year=2004\n|chapter= Norway\n}}\n* {{cite book |title=Books in Early Modern Norway |author= {{illm|Gina Dahl|no}} |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004207202 |year=2011\n}}\n\n===in Norwegian===\n;Encyclopedias\n*{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Norge \u2013 massemedier|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Norge/massemedier|language=Norwegian}}\n;Books\n*{{cite book|title=Massemediene|last=\u00d8stbye|first=Helge|year=1984|publisher=Tiden|location=Oslo|isbn=82-10-02375-6|language=Norwegian}}\n*{{cite book|title=Blod, sverte og gledest\u00e5rer.

Freedom of the press in Norway dates back to the [[Constitution of Norway|constitution]] of 1814. Most of the Norwegian press is privately owned and self-regulated; however, the state provides [[press support]].\n\n== Television ==\n{{Main|Television in Norway}}\n\nThe two companies dominating the Norwegian terrestrial broadcast television are the governmental owned [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]] (with four main services, [[NRK1]], [[NRK2]], [[NRK3]] and [[NRK Super]]) and [[TV 2 (Norway)|TV2]] (with [[TV 2 Filmkanalen]], [[TV 2 Nyhetskanalen]], [[TV 2 Sport (Norway)|TV 2 Sport]], [[TV 2 Zebra]] and [[TV 2 Livsstil]]). Other, long-running channels are [[TVNorge]] and [[TV3 (Norway)|TV3]].\n\n== Radio ==\n{{main|List of Norwegian-language radio stations}}\nNational radio is dominated by the public-service company [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]], which is funded from the [[television licence|television licence fee]] payable by the owners of television sets. NRK provides programming on three radio channels \u2013 [[NRK P1]], [[NRK P2]], and [[NRK P3]] \u2013 broadcast on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and via [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]]. A number of further specialist channels are broadcast exclusively on DAB, [[DVB-T]], and [[Internet radio|the internet]] including Radio Norway Direct Norway's new English language Radio Station.\n\nAdditionally, there are a number of commercial radio stations as well as local radio stations run by various non-profit organizations.\n\n== Social media==\n{{Main|Social media}}\nAs of August 2009, it was estimated that 1,156,000 Norwegians use [[Facebook]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.journalisten.no/story/58279|title=68.000 p\u00e5 Twitter|last=Jensen|first=Martin Huseby|date=7 August 2009|work=Klassekampen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=9 October 2009}}</ref> For comparison, the total number of inhabitants is about 4,830,000.\n\n== Institutions ==\nInstitutions within organized labour are the [[Norwegian Union of Journalists]], the [[Association of Norwegian Editors]] and the [[Norwegian Media Businesses' Association]]&mdash;these are organized in the umbrella [[Norwegian Press Association]]. The Press Association is responsible for [[Pressens Faglige Utvalg]], which oversees the [[Ethical Code of Practice for the Norwegian Press]].

He also expressed concern that journalists who sympathise with the Progress Party may have a lesser chance to get hired than journalists with political sympathies close to editors.<ref name=\"loset\">{{cite news|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/politikk/redaktoerer-vil-ha-jens-1769680.html|work=TV2|title=Redakt\u00f8rer vil ha Jens|first=Kjetil|last=L\u00f8set|date=18 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nFor instance, in the actual [[2009 Norwegian parliamentary election|2009 election]], the Progress Party received 41 mandates, while by journalists it would have received none. The Christian Democratic Party and Center Party would also have been left without representation, while the revolutionary socialist party Red would enter parliament with 9 mandates. The Socialist Left and Liberal Party would also receive significant gains.<ref name=\"aarebrot\"/> In 2003, as much as 36% of Norwegian journalists said they would vote for the Socialist Left Party alone, with only 25% saying that they would vote for any of the right-of-center Liberal, Christian Democratic, Conservative or Progress Party combined.<ref name=\"loset\"/> News commentator [[Frank Rossavik]] once said that if a journalist would stand forward as a Progress Party voter, it would have been \"social suicide\", and more devastating than withdrawing from the Norwegian Union of Journalists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bt.no/meninger/kommentar/rossavik/article402128.ece?start=2|work=Bergens Tidende|title=Venstrevridde journalister|first=Frank|last=Rossavik|date=30 August 2007|access-date=9 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910133121/http://www.bt.no/meninger/kommentar/rossavik/article402128.ece?start=2|archive-date=10 September 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nNorwegian editors have as well been proven to have leftist political views, with a 2008 survey showing that the Labour Party would have been given a majority in parliament alone with 85 representatives.<ref name=\"loset\"/>\n\nThe notion of political bias based on the sum of individuals' party selection has been criticized. Among others, conservative historian and politician [[Francis Sejersted]] holds that the general media is neither left-slanted nor right-slanted, but \"media-slanted\". This means that media across the political spectrum have a tendency to choose the same angle on a case, focusing on personification and dramatic events.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/artikler/kultur_medier/9931/article/item/null|title=Konserntrusselen|last=Nore|first=Aslak|date=3 March 2004|work=Klassekampen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=9 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135324/http://www.klassekampen.no/artikler/kultur_medier/9931/article/item/null|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Communications in Norway]]\n*[[Culture of Norway]]\n*[[Internet in Norway]]\n* [[Open access in Norway]]\n\n;Lists\n*[[List of Norwegian newspapers]]\n*[[List of Norwegian magazines]]\n*[[List of Norwegian television channels]]\n*[[List of Norwegian-language radio stations]]\n*[[List of Norwegian writers]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n===in English===\n* {{cite book|title=Europa World Year Book |publisher=[[Europa Publications]] |isbn=978-1-85743-255-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gP_-8rXzQs8C |year=2004\n|chapter=Norway: Press\n}}\n* {{cite book|editor1=Euromedia Research Group |editor2=Mary Kelly|display-editors=etal|title= Media in Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KRfXsBUBeAC|publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |isbn=978-0-7619-4132-3 |edition=3rd |year=2004\n|chapter= Norway\n|pages= \n}}\n* {{cite book |title=Books in Early Modern Norway |author= {{illm|Gina Dahl|no}} |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004207202 |year=2011\n}}\n\n===in Norwegian===\n;Encyclopedias\n*{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Norge \u2013 massemedier|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Norge/massemedier|language=Norwegian}}\n;Books\n*{{cite book|title=Massemediene|last=\u00d8stbye|first=Helge|year=1984|publisher=Tiden|location=Oslo|isbn=82-10-02375-6|language=Norwegian}}\n*{{cite book|title=Blod, sverte og gledest\u00e5rer.

Over 83% of the school's boys represent QEGS in one sporting event or another. The most popular [[sport]] is [[rugby union]], followed by [[hockey]], [[cricket]], [[sport of athletics|athletics]] and [[basketball]]. Hockey in particular has experienced substantial growth in the school throughout the last decade, and is now close to matching rugby union's dominance internally. In 2006, 2013, 2014 and 2015 the under-15s Rugby side reached the ''[[Daily Mail Cup]]'' final, winning the 2015 competition in a tight 15-6 win over three time final rivals [[Warwick School|Warwick]]. In 2009 every age group won the hockey 'Yorkshire Cup' for the first time in the school's history with the under 16s going on to reach the national semi-finals, only to lose to Whitgift School. As well as plenty of sporting opportunities, the school also gives pupils the opportunity to participate in the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n*[[David Storey]]'s [[Booker Prize]] winning novel ''Saville'' (1976) includes an account of the experiences of a working class boy at a Yorkshire grammar school in the 1940s.

The golden lion on a red field refers to the royal foundation; the silver owl on black is taken from the arms of the Savile family (one of the founding families) and the Bible indicates the religious side of education. The school motto \u2013 Turpe Nescire \u2013 means \u201cIt is a disgrace to be ignorant\u201d.<ref name=\"QEGS History\" />\n\n===School song===\n\nAround 1900, H. G. Abel, then the senior classics master, composed 'Floreas, Wakefieldia' and Matthew Peacock, headmaster and honorary choirmaster at the cathedral, set the words to music. It was seen as fitting that the song should be written in Latin, thereby evoking echoes of traditional scholasticism. The song is still sung today \u2013 at Founders' Day, Speech Day and at all Old Savilian Club dinners.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:Queen_Elizabeth_Grammar_School_(QEGS)_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1167685.jpg|thumb|257x257px|The current buildings on Northgate]]\n\nIn 1854 QEGS moved to its present site in Northgate, [[Wakefield]], into premises designed by the architect [[Richard Lane (architect)|Richard Lane]]<ref>{{NHLE |num=1258481 |desc= Queen Elizabeth Grammar School |accessdate=28 July 2019  }}</ref> and formerly occupied by the West Riding Proprietary School.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hgHAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA172&lpg=PA172&dq=%22West+Riding+Proprietary+School%22+richard+lane&source=web&ots=_o9wiaSodU&sig=SKVat_YY_APXKafxGN0j9nXOK2k&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA172,M1 |title=The Annals of Yorkshire from the Earliest Period to the Present Time By Henry Schroder, page 172 |accessdate=3 July 2008 |publisher=Published by George Crosby, 1852 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C4EAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=Loudon%27s+Architectural+Magazine+Richard+Lane&source=web&ots=Ql-g_EGi6J&sig=sbnlwViKF6Wz0Uayaw6Hd0XB4vI&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result |title=Loudon's Architectural Magazine, And Journal of Improvement in Architecture (edited by John Claudius Loudon), page 142 |accessdate=5 July 2008 |publisher=Published by Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown Green & Longman; and Weale Architectural Library, 1834 }}</ref> The attached Junior school for boys aged 7 to 11 was founded in 1910.\n\nA new building (Savile Building) was opened in 2005 by [[Ted Wragg]], the famous educationalist, who taught at the school in the early 1960s.

Over 83% of the school's boys represent QEGS in one sporting event or another. The most popular [[sport]] is [[rugby union]], followed by [[hockey]], [[cricket]], [[sport of athletics|athletics]] and [[basketball]]. Hockey in particular has experienced substantial growth in the school throughout the last decade, and is now close to matching rugby union's dominance internally. In 2006, 2013, 2014 and 2015 the under-15s Rugby side reached the ''[[Daily Mail Cup]]'' final, winning the 2015 competition in a tight 15-6 win over three time final rivals [[Warwick School|Warwick]]. In 2009 every age group won the hockey 'Yorkshire Cup' for the first time in the school's history with the under 16s going on to reach the national semi-finals, only to lose to Whitgift School. As well as plenty of sporting opportunities, the school also gives pupils the opportunity to participate in the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n*[[David Storey]]'s [[Booker Prize]] winning novel ''Saville'' (1976) includes an account of the experiences of a working class boy at a Yorkshire grammar school in the 1940s.
