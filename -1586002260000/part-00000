In response to a [[Message (computing)|message]] it receives, an actor can: make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received. Actors may modify their own [[private state]], but can only affect each other indirectly through messaging (obviating [[Lock (computer science)|lock-based synchronization]]).\n\nThe actor model originated in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|ref={{harvid|Hewitt et al.|1973}} |last=Hewitt|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Hewitt|last2=Bishop|first2=Peter|last3=Steiger|first3=Richard|title=A Universal Modular Actor Formalism for Artificial Intelligence|publisher=IJCAI|year=1973}}</ref> It has been used both as a framework for a [[Actor model theory|theoretical understanding]] of [[Concurrency (computer science)|computation]] and as the theoretical basis for several [[Actor model implementation|practical implementations]] of [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent systems]].

This is similar to the ''everything is an object'' philosophy used by some [[object-oriented programming]] languages.\n\nAn actor is a computational entity that, in response to a message it receives, can concurrently:\n* send a finite number of messages to other actors;\n* create a finite number of new actors;\n* designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives.\n\nThere is no assumed sequence to the above actions and they could be carried out in parallel.\n\nDecoupling the sender from communications sent was a fundamental advance of the actor model enabling [[asynchronous communication]] and control structures as patterns of [[message passing|passing messages]].<ref>Carl Hewitt.

June 1977.</ref>\n\nRecipients of messages are identified by address, sometimes called \"mailing address\". Thus an actor can only communicate with actors whose addresses it has. It can obtain those from a message it receives, or if the address is for an actor it has itself created.\n\nThe actor model is characterized by inherent concurrency of computation within and among actors, dynamic creation of actors, inclusion of actor addresses in messages, and interaction only through direct asynchronous [[message passing]] with no restriction on message arrival order.\n\n== Formal systems ==\nOver the years, several different formal systems have been developed which permit reasoning about systems in the actor model.

K. Guo|title=Formalizing Actors in Linear Logic|publisher=International Conference on Object-Oriented Information Systems|year=1994}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2006}}\nThe actor model can be used as a framework for modeling, understanding, and reasoning about a wide range of [[concurrent systems]]. For example:\n\n* Electronic mail ([[email]]) can be modeled as an actor system. Accounts are modeled as actors and [[email address]]es as actor addresses.\n* [[Web service]]s can be modeled with Simple Object Access Protocol ([[SOAP]]) endpoints modeled as actor addresses.\n* Objects with [[Lock (computer science)|lock]]s (''e.g.'', as in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) can be modeled as a ''serializer'', provided that their implementations are such that messages can continually arrive (perhaps by being stored in an internal [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]]). A serializer is an important kind of actor defined by the property that it is continually available to the arrival of new messages; every message sent to a serializer is guaranteed to arrive.\n* Testing and Test Control Notation ([[TTCN]]), both TTCN-2 and [[TTCN-3]], follows actor model rather closely. In TTCN actor is a test component: either parallel test component (PTC) or main test component (MTC). Test components can send and receive messages to and from remote partners (peer test components or test system interface), the latter being identified by its address. Each test component has a behaviour tree bound to it; test components run in parallel and can be dynamically created by parent test components. Built-in language constructs allow the definition of actions to be taken when an expected message is received from the internal message queue, like sending a message to another peer entity or creating new test components.\n\n==Message-passing semantics==\nThe actor model is about the semantics of [[message passing]].\n\n=== Unbounded nondeterminism controversy ===\nArguably, the first concurrent programs were [[interrupt handler]]s. During the course of its normal operation a computer needed to be able to receive information from outside (characters from a keyboard, packets from a network, ''etc''). So when the information arrived the execution of the computer was ''interrupted'' and special code (called an interrupt handler) was called to put the information in a [[data buffer]] where it could be subsequently retrieved.\n\nIn the early 1960s, interrupts began to be used to simulate the concurrent execution of several programs on one processor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Per Brinch |author-link=Per Brinch Hansen |title=The Origins of Concurrent Programming: From Semaphores to Remote Procedure Calls |isbn=978-0-387-95401-1 |publisher=Springer |year=2002}}</ref> Having concurrency with [[shared memory]] gave rise to the problem of [[concurrency control]]. Originally, this problem was conceived as being one of [[mutual exclusion]] on a single computer. [[Edsger Dijkstra]] developed [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] and later, between 1971 and 1973,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hansen |first=Per Brinch |author-link=Per Brinch Hansen |date=1996 |title=Monitors and Concurrent Pascal: A Personal History |journal=Communications of the ACM |pages=121\u2013172}}</ref> [[Tony Hoare]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hoare |first=Tony |author-link=Tony Hoare |date=October 1974 |title=Monitors: An Operating System Structuring Concept |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=549\u2013557|doi=10.1145/355620.361161 }}</ref> and [[Per Brinch Hansen]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Per Brinch |author-link=Per Brinch Hansen |date=July 1973 |title=Operating System Principles |publisher=Prentice-Hall}}</ref> developed [[Monitor (synchronization)|monitors]] to solve the mutual exclusion problem. However, neither of these solutions provided a programming language construct that encapsulated access to shared resources. This encapsulation was later accomplished by the [[Serialization|serializer]] construct ([Hewitt and Atkinson 1977, 1979] and [Atkinson 1980]).\n\nThe first models of computation (''e.g.'', [[Turing machines]], Post productions, the [[lambda calculus]], ''etc.'') were based on mathematics and made use of a global state to represent a computational ''step'' (later generalized in [McCarthy and Hayes 1969] and [Dijkstra 1976] see [[Actor model early history#Event orderings versus global state|Event orderings versus global state]]). Each computational step was from one global state of the computation to the next global state. The global state approach was continued in [[automata theory]] for [[finite-state machine]]s and push down [[stack machine]]s, including their [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic]] versions. Such nondeterministic automata have the property of [[unbounded nondeterminism|bounded nondeterminism]]; that is, if a machine always halts when started in its initial state, then there is a bound on the number of states in which it halts.\n\n[[Edsger Dijkstra]] further developed the nondeterministic global state approach. Dijkstra's model gave rise to a controversy concerning [[unbounded nondeterminism]] (also called ''unbounded indeterminacy''), a property of [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]] by which the amount of delay in servicing a request can become unbounded as a result of arbitration of contention for shared resources ''while still guaranteeing that the request will eventually be serviced''. Hewitt argued that the actor model should provide the guarantee of service. In Dijkstra's model, although there could be an unbounded amount of time between the execution of sequential instructions on a computer, a (parallel) program that started out in a well defined state could terminate in only a bounded number of states [Dijkstra 1976]. Consequently, his model could not provide the guarantee of service. Dijkstra argued that it was impossible to implement unbounded nondeterminism.\n\nHewitt argued otherwise: there is no bound that can be placed on how long it takes a computational circuit called an ''[[Arbiter (electronics)|arbiter]]'' to settle (see [[metastability (electronics)]]).<ref name=\"zenil\">{{cite book |last=Hewitt |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Hewitt |date=2012 |chapter=What is computation?

Turing on the 100th anniversary of his birth. |editor-last=Zenil |editor-first=Hector |publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company}}</ref> Arbiters are used in computers to deal with the circumstance that computer clocks operate asynchronously with respect to input from outside, ''e.g.'', keyboard input, disk access, network input, ''etc.'' So it could take an unbounded time for a message sent to a computer to be received and in the meantime the computer could traverse an unbounded number of states.\n\nThe actor model features unbounded nondeterminism which was captured in a mathematical model by [[Will Clinger]] using [[domain theory]].<ref name=\"clinger1981\"/> In the actor model, there is no global state.{{dubious|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Direct communication and asynchrony===\nMessages in the actor model are not necessarily buffered. This was a sharp break with previous approaches to models of concurrent computation. The lack of buffering caused a great deal of misunderstanding at the time of the development of the actor model and is still a controversial issue. Some researchers argued that the messages are buffered in the \"ether\" or the \"environment\". Also, messages in the actor model are simply sent (like [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] in [[Internet Protocol|IP]]); there is no requirement for a synchronous handshake with the recipient.\n\n===Actor creation plus addresses in messages means variable topology===\nA natural development of the actor model was to allow addresses in messages. Influenced by [[Packet switching|packet switched networks]] [1961 and 1964], Hewitt proposed the development of a new model of concurrent computation in which communications would not have any required fields at all: they could be empty. Of course, if the sender of a communication desired a recipient to have access to addresses which the recipient did not already have, the address would have to be sent in the communication.\n\nFor example, an actor might need to send a message to a recipient actor from which it later expects to receive a response, but the response will actually be handled by a third actor component that has been configured to receive and handle the response (for example, a different actor implementing the [[observer pattern]]). The original actor could accomplish this by sending a communication that includes the message it wishes to send, along with the address of the third actor that will handle the response. This third actor that will handle the response is called the ''resumption'' (sometimes also called a [[continuation]] or [[stack frame]]). When the recipient actor is ready to send a response, it sends the response message to the ''resumption'' actor address that was included in the original communication.\n\nSo, the ability of actors to create new actors with which they can exchange communications, along with the ability to include the addresses of other actors in messages, gives actors the ability to create and participate in arbitrarily variable topological relationships with one another, much as the objects in Simula and other object-oriented languages may also be relationally composed into variable topologies of message-exchanging objects.\n\n===Inherently concurrent===\nAs opposed to the previous approach based on composing sequential processes, the actor model was developed as an inherently concurrent model. In the actor model sequentiality was a special case that derived from concurrent computation as explained in [[actor model theory]].\n\n===No requirement on order of message arrival===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nHewitt argued against adding the requirement that messages must arrive in the order in which they are sent to the actor. If output message ordering is desired, then it can be modeled by a queue actor that provides this functionality. Such a queue actor would queue the messages that arrived so that they could be retrieved in [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] order. So if an actor <tt>X</tt> sent a message <tt>M1</tt> to an actor <tt>Y</tt>, and later <tt>X</tt> sent another message <tt>M2</tt> to <tt>Y</tt>, there is no requirement that <tt>M1</tt> arrives at <tt>Y</tt> before <tt>M2</tt>.\n\nIn this respect the actor model mirrors [[packet switching]] systems which do not guarantee that packets must be received in the order sent. Not providing the order of delivery guarantee allows packet switching to buffer packets, use multiple paths to send packets, resend damaged packets, and to provide other optimizations.\n\nFor example, actors are allowed to pipeline the processing of messages. What this means is that in the course of processing a message <tt>M1</tt>, an actor can designate the behavior to be used to process the next message, and then in fact begin processing another message <tt>M2</tt> before it has finished processing <tt>M1</tt>. Just because an actor is allowed to pipeline the processing of messages does not mean that it ''must'' pipeline the processing. Whether a message is pipelined is an engineering tradeoff. How would an external observer know whether the processing of a message by an actor has been pipelined? There is no ambiguity in the definition of an actor created by the possibility of pipelining. Of course, it is possible to perform the pipeline optimization incorrectly in some implementations, in which case unexpected behavior may occur.\n\n===Locality===\nAnother important characteristic of the actor model is locality.\n\nLocality means that in processing a message, an actor can send messages only to addresses that it receives in the message, addresses that it already had before it received the message, and addresses for actors that it creates while processing the message. (But see [[#Synthesizing addresses of actors|Synthesizing addresses of actors]].)\n\nAlso locality means that there is no simultaneous change in multiple locations. In this way it differs from some other models of concurrency, ''e.g.'', the [[Petri net]] model in which tokens are simultaneously removed from multiple locations and placed in other locations.\n\n===Composing actor systems===\nThe idea of composing actor systems into larger ones is an important aspect of [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] that was developed in Gul Agha's doctoral dissertation,<ref name=\"agha1986\"/> developed later by Gul Agha, Ian Mason, Scott Smith, and [[Carolyn Talcott]].<ref name=\"agha1993\"/>\n\n===Behaviors===\nA key innovation was the introduction of ''behavior'' specified as a mathematical function to express what an actor does when it processes a message, including specifying a new behavior to process the next message that arrives. Behaviors provided a mechanism to mathematically model the sharing in concurrency.\n\nBehaviors also freed the actor model from implementation details, ''e.g.'', the Smalltalk-72 token stream interpreter. However, it is critical to understand that the efficient implementation of systems described by the actor model require ''extensive'' optimization. See [[Actor model implementation]] for details.\n\n=== Modeling other concurrency systems ===\nOther concurrency systems (''e.g.'', [[process calculi]]) can be modeled in the actor model using a [[two-phase commit protocol]].<ref>Frederick Knabe. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frederick_Knabe/publication/2823488_A_Distributed_Protocol_for_Channel-Based_Communication_with_Choice/links/00463536b853ab72ef000000.pdf A Distributed Protocol for Channel-Based Communication with Choice PARLE 1992].</ref>\n\n=== Computational Representation Theorem ===\n{{see also|Denotational semantics of the Actor model}}\nThere is a ''Computational Representation Theorem'' in the actor model for systems which are closed in the sense that they do not receive communications from outside. The mathematical denotation denoted by a closed system <tt>S</tt> is constructed from an initial behavior <tt>\u22a5<sub>S</sub></tt> and a behavior-approximating function <tt>'''progression'''<sub>S</sub></tt>. These obtain increasingly better approximations and construct a denotation (meaning) for <tt>S</tt> as follows [Hewitt 2008; Clinger 1981]:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{Denote}_{\\mathtt{S}} \\equiv \\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\mathbf{progression}_{\\mathtt{S}^i}(\\bot_\\mathtt{S})</math>\n\nIn this way, <tt>S</tt> can be mathematically characterized in terms of all its possible behaviors (including those involving unbounded nondeterminism). Although <tt>Denote<sub>S</sub></tt> is not an implementation of <tt>S</tt>, it can be used to prove a generalization of the Church-Turing-Rosser-Kleene thesis [Kleene 1943]:\n\nA consequence of the above theorem is that a finite actor can nondeterministically respond with an {{clarify span|uncountable|reason=Uncountability is the property of real numbers, this sounds like (countably) infinite was meant|date=November 2013}} number of different outputs.\n\n===Relationship to logic programming===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nOne of the key motivations for the development of the actor model was to understand and deal with the control structure issues that arose in development of the [[Planner programming language]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Once the actor model was initially defined, an important challenge was to understand the power of the model relative to [[Robert Kowalski]]'s thesis that \"computation can be subsumed by deduction\". Hewitt argued that Kowalski's thesis turned out to be false for the concurrent computation in the actor model (see [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation]]).\n\nNevertheless, attempts were made to extend [[logic programming]] to concurrent computation. However, Hewitt and Agha [1991] claimed that the resulting systems were not deductive in the following sense: computational steps of the concurrent logic programming systems do not follow deductively from previous steps (see [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation]]). Recently, logic programming has been integrated into the actor model in a way that maintains logical semantics.<ref name=\"zenil\"/>\n\n===Migration===\nMigration in the actor model is the ability of actors to change locations. ''E.g.'', in his dissertation, Aki Yonezawa modeled a post office that customer actors could enter, change locations within while operating, and exit. An actor that can migrate can be modeled by having a location actor that changes when the actor migrates. However the faithfulness of this modeling is controversial and the subject of research.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Security===\nThe security of actors can be protected in the following ways:\n* [[Hardwired control|hardwiring]] in which actors are physically connected\n* [[computer hardware]] as in [[Burroughs B5000]], [[Lisp machine]], ''etc.''\n* [[virtual machines]] as in [[Java virtual machine]], [[Common Language Runtime]], ''etc.''\n* [[operating systems]] as in [[capability-based security|capability-based systems]]\n* [[Digital signature|signing]] and/or [[encryption]] of actors and their addresses\n\n===Synthesizing addresses of actors===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nA delicate point in the actor model is the ability to synthesize the address of an actor. In some cases security can be used to prevent the synthesis of addresses (see [[#Security|Security]]). However, if an actor address is simply a bit string then clearly it can be synthesized although it may be difficult or even infeasible to guess the address of an actor if the bit strings are long enough. [[SOAP]] uses a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] for the address of an endpoint where an actor can be reached. Since a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] is a character string, it can clearly be synthesized although encryption can make it virtually impossible to guess.\n\nSynthesizing the addresses of actors is usually modeled using mapping. The idea is to use an actor system to perform the mapping to the actual actor addresses. For example, on a computer the memory structure of the computer can be modeled as an actor system that does the mapping. In the case of [[SOAP]] addresses, it's modeling the [[Domain Name System|DNS]] and the rest of the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] mapping.\n\n===Contrast with other models of message-passing concurrency===\n[[Robin Milner]]'s initial published work on concurrency<ref>Robin Milner. Processes: A Mathematical Model of Computing Agents in Logic Colloquium 1973.</ref> was also notable in that it was not based on composing sequential processes. His work differed from the actor model because it was based on a fixed number of processes of fixed topology communicating numbers and strings using synchronous communication. The original [[communicating sequential processes]] (CSP) model<ref>C.A.R. Hoare. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359585&dl=GUIDE&coll=GUIDE&CFID=19884966&CFTOKEN=55490895 Communicating sequential processes] CACM. August 1978.</ref> published by [[Tony Hoare]] differed from the actor model because<!-- redundant --> it was based on the parallel composition of a fixed number of sequential processes connected in a fixed topology, and communicating using synchronous message-passing based on process names (see [[Actor model and process calculi history#Early work|Actor model and process calculi history]]). Later versions of CSP abandoned communication based on process names in favor of anonymous communication via channels, an approach also used in Milner's work on the [[calculus of communicating systems]] and the [[\u03c0-calculus]].\n\nThese early models by Milner and Hoare both had the property of bounded nondeterminism. Modern, theoretical CSP ([Hoare 1985] and [Roscoe 2005]) explicitly provides unbounded nondeterminism.\n\n[[Petri nets]] and their extensions (e.g., coloured Petri nets) are like actors in that they are based on asynchronous message passing and unbounded nondeterminism, while they are like early CSP in that they define fixed topologies of elementary processing steps (transitions) and message repositories (places).\n\n==Influence==\nThe actor model has been influential on both theory development and practical software development.\n\n===Theory===\nThe actor model has influenced the development of the [[\u03c0-calculus]] and subsequent [[process calculi]]. In his Turing lecture, Robin Milner wrote:<ref>{{cite journal|title=Elements of interaction |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=36 |pages=78\u201389 |doi=10.1145/151233.151240 |year=1993 |last1=Milner |first1=Robin}}</ref>\n<blockquote>Now, the pure lambda-calculus is built with just two kinds of thing: terms and variables. Can we achieve the same economy for a process calculus? Carl Hewitt, with his actors model, responded to this challenge long ago; he declared that a value, an operator on values, and a process should all be the same kind of thing: an actor.\nThis goal impressed me, because it implies the homogeneity and completeness of expression ... But it was long before I could see how to attain the goal in terms of an algebraic calculus...\nSo, in the spirit of Hewitt, our first step is to demand that all things denoted by terms or accessed by names\u2014values, registers, operators, processes, objects\u2014are all of the same kind of thing; they should all be processes.</blockquote>\n\n===Practice===\nThe actor model has had extensive influence on commercial practice. For example, Twitter has used actors for scalability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://waimingmok.wordpress.com/2009/06/27/how-twitter-is-scaling/ |title=How Twitter Is Scaling \u00ab Waiming Mok's Blog |publisher=Waimingmok.wordpress.com |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref> Also, Microsoft has used the actor model in the development of its Asynchronous Agents Library.<ref>\"[https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/623b6c0f-c229-4fcd-8a9d-a5ef24c60db9 Actor-Based Programming with the Asynchronous Agents Library]\" MSDN September 2010.</ref> There are many other actor libraries listed in the actor libraries and frameworks section below.\n\n==Addressed issues==\nAccording to Hewitt [2006], the actor model addresses issues in computer and communications architecture, [[concurrent programming language]]s, and [[Web service]]s including the following:\n* [[Scalability]]: the challenge of scaling up concurrency both locally and nonlocally.\n* [[Location transparency|Transparency]]: bridging the chasm between local and nonlocal concurrency. Transparency is currently a controversial issue. Some researchers {{Who|date=June 2010}} have advocated a strict separation between local concurrency using concurrent programming languages (e.g., [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) from nonlocal concurrency using [[SOAP]] for [[Web service]]s. Strict separation produces a lack of transparency that causes problems when it is desirable/necessary to change between local and nonlocal access to Web services (see [[Distributed computing]]).\n* [[Inconsistency]]: inconsistency is the norm because all very large knowledge systems about human information system interactions are inconsistent. This inconsistency extends to the documentation and specifications of very large systems (e.g., Microsoft Windows software, etc.), which are internally inconsistent.\n\nMany of the ideas introduced in the actor model are now also finding application in [[multi-agent systems]] for these same reasons [Hewitt 2006b 2007b]. The key difference is that agent systems (in most definitions) impose extra constraints upon the actors, typically requiring that they make use of commitments and goals.\n\n== Programming with actors ==\nA number of different programming languages employ the actor model or some variation of it.

Actors may modify their own [[private state]], but can only affect each other indirectly through messaging (obviating [[Lock (computer science)|lock-based synchronization]]).\n\nThe actor model originated in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|ref={{harvid|Hewitt et al.|1973}} |last=Hewitt|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Hewitt|last2=Bishop|first2=Peter|last3=Steiger|first3=Richard|title=A Universal Modular Actor Formalism for Artificial Intelligence|publisher=IJCAI|year=1973}}</ref> It has been used both as a framework for a [[Actor model theory|theoretical understanding]] of [[Concurrency (computer science)|computation]] and as the theoretical basis for several [[Actor model implementation|practical implementations]] of [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent systems]].

This is similar to the ''everything is an object'' philosophy used by some [[object-oriented programming]] languages.\n\nAn actor is a computational entity that, in response to a message it receives, can concurrently:\n* send a finite number of messages to other actors;\n* create a finite number of new actors;\n* designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives.\n\nThere is no assumed sequence to the above actions and they could be carried out in parallel.\n\nDecoupling the sender from communications sent was a fundamental advance of the actor model enabling [[asynchronous communication]] and control structures as patterns of [[message passing|passing messages]].<ref>Carl Hewitt. ''[http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA038246 Viewing Control Structures as Patterns of Passing Messages]'' Journal of Artificial Intelligence. June 1977.</ref>\n\nRecipients of messages are identified by address, sometimes called \"mailing address\". Thus an actor can only communicate with actors whose addresses it has. It can obtain those from a message it receives, or if the address is for an actor it has itself created.\n\nThe actor model is characterized by inherent concurrency of computation within and among actors, dynamic creation of actors, inclusion of actor addresses in messages, and interaction only through direct asynchronous [[message passing]] with no restriction on message arrival order.\n\n== Formal systems ==\nOver the years, several different formal systems have been developed which permit reasoning about systems in the actor model.

For example:\n\n* Electronic mail ([[email]]) can be modeled as an actor system. Accounts are modeled as actors and [[email address]]es as actor addresses.\n* [[Web service]]s can be modeled with Simple Object Access Protocol ([[SOAP]]) endpoints modeled as actor addresses.\n* Objects with [[Lock (computer science)|lock]]s (''e.g.'', as in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) can be modeled as a ''serializer'', provided that their implementations are such that messages can continually arrive (perhaps by being stored in an internal [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]]). A serializer is an important kind of actor defined by the property that it is continually available to the arrival of new messages; every message sent to a serializer is guaranteed to arrive.\n* Testing and Test Control Notation ([[TTCN]]), both TTCN-2 and [[TTCN-3]], follows actor model rather closely. In TTCN actor is a test component: either parallel test component (PTC) or main test component (MTC). Test components can send and receive messages to and from remote partners (peer test components or test system interface), the latter being identified by its address. Each test component has a behaviour tree bound to it; test components run in parallel and can be dynamically created by parent test components. Built-in language constructs allow the definition of actions to be taken when an expected message is received from the internal message queue, like sending a message to another peer entity or creating new test components.\n\n==Message-passing semantics==\nThe actor model is about the semantics of [[message passing]].\n\n=== Unbounded nondeterminism controversy ===\nArguably, the first concurrent programs were [[interrupt handler]]s. During the course of its normal operation a computer needed to be able to receive information from outside (characters from a keyboard, packets from a network, ''etc''). So when the information arrived the execution of the computer was ''interrupted'' and special code (called an interrupt handler) was called to put the information in a [[data buffer]] where it could be subsequently retrieved.\n\nIn the early 1960s, interrupts began to be used to simulate the concurrent execution of several programs on one processor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Per Brinch |author-link=Per Brinch Hansen |title=The Origins of Concurrent Programming: From Semaphores to Remote Procedure Calls |isbn=978-0-387-95401-1 |publisher=Springer |year=2002}}</ref> Having concurrency with [[shared memory]] gave rise to the problem of [[concurrency control]]. Originally, this problem was conceived as being one of [[mutual exclusion]] on a single computer. [[Edsger Dijkstra]] developed [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] and later, between 1971 and 1973,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hansen |first=Per Brinch |author-link=Per Brinch Hansen |date=1996 |title=Monitors and Concurrent Pascal: A Personal History |journal=Communications of the ACM |pages=121\u2013172}}</ref> [[Tony Hoare]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hoare |first=Tony |author-link=Tony Hoare |date=October 1974 |title=Monitors: An Operating System Structuring Concept |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=549\u2013557|doi=10.1145/355620.361161 }}</ref> and [[Per Brinch Hansen]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Per Brinch |author-link=Per Brinch Hansen |date=July 1973 |title=Operating System Principles |publisher=Prentice-Hall}}</ref> developed [[Monitor (synchronization)|monitors]] to solve the mutual exclusion problem. However, neither of these solutions provided a programming language construct that encapsulated access to shared resources. This encapsulation was later accomplished by the [[Serialization|serializer]] construct ([Hewitt and Atkinson 1977, 1979] and [Atkinson 1980]).\n\nThe first models of computation (''e.g.'', [[Turing machines]], Post productions, the [[lambda calculus]], ''etc.'') were based on mathematics and made use of a global state to represent a computational ''step'' (later generalized in [McCarthy and Hayes 1969] and [Dijkstra 1976] see [[Actor model early history#Event orderings versus global state|Event orderings versus global state]]). Each computational step was from one global state of the computation to the next global state. The global state approach was continued in [[automata theory]] for [[finite-state machine]]s and push down [[stack machine]]s, including their [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic]] versions. Such nondeterministic automata have the property of [[unbounded nondeterminism|bounded nondeterminism]]; that is, if a machine always halts when started in its initial state, then there is a bound on the number of states in which it halts.\n\n[[Edsger Dijkstra]] further developed the nondeterministic global state approach. Dijkstra's model gave rise to a controversy concerning [[unbounded nondeterminism]] (also called ''unbounded indeterminacy''), a property of [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]] by which the amount of delay in servicing a request can become unbounded as a result of arbitration of contention for shared resources ''while still guaranteeing that the request will eventually be serviced''. Hewitt argued that the actor model should provide the guarantee of service. In Dijkstra's model, although there could be an unbounded amount of time between the execution of sequential instructions on a computer, a (parallel) program that started out in a well defined state could terminate in only a bounded number of states [Dijkstra 1976]. Consequently, his model could not provide the guarantee of service. Dijkstra argued that it was impossible to implement unbounded nondeterminism.\n\nHewitt argued otherwise: there is no bound that can be placed on how long it takes a computational circuit called an ''[[Arbiter (electronics)|arbiter]]'' to settle (see [[metastability (electronics)]]).<ref name=\"zenil\">{{cite book |last=Hewitt |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Hewitt |date=2012 |chapter=What is computation?

Turing on the 100th anniversary of his birth. |editor-last=Zenil |editor-first=Hector |publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company}}</ref> Arbiters are used in computers to deal with the circumstance that computer clocks operate asynchronously with respect to input from outside, ''e.g.'', keyboard input, disk access, network input, ''etc.'' So it could take an unbounded time for a message sent to a computer to be received and in the meantime the computer could traverse an unbounded number of states.\n\nThe actor model features unbounded nondeterminism which was captured in a mathematical model by [[Will Clinger]] using [[domain theory]].<ref name=\"clinger1981\"/> In the actor model, there is no global state.{{dubious|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Direct communication and asynchrony===\nMessages in the actor model are not necessarily buffered. This was a sharp break with previous approaches to models of concurrent computation. The lack of buffering caused a great deal of misunderstanding at the time of the development of the actor model and is still a controversial issue. Some researchers argued that the messages are buffered in the \"ether\" or the \"environment\". Also, messages in the actor model are simply sent (like [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] in [[Internet Protocol|IP]]); there is no requirement for a synchronous handshake with the recipient.\n\n===Actor creation plus addresses in messages means variable topology===\nA natural development of the actor model was to allow addresses in messages. Influenced by [[Packet switching|packet switched networks]] [1961 and 1964], Hewitt proposed the development of a new model of concurrent computation in which communications would not have any required fields at all: they could be empty. Of course, if the sender of a communication desired a recipient to have access to addresses which the recipient did not already have, the address would have to be sent in the communication.\n\nFor example, an actor might need to send a message to a recipient actor from which it later expects to receive a response, but the response will actually be handled by a third actor component that has been configured to receive and handle the response (for example, a different actor implementing the [[observer pattern]]). The original actor could accomplish this by sending a communication that includes the message it wishes to send, along with the address of the third actor that will handle the response. This third actor that will handle the response is called the ''resumption'' (sometimes also called a [[continuation]] or [[stack frame]]). When the recipient actor is ready to send a response, it sends the response message to the ''resumption'' actor address that was included in the original communication.\n\nSo, the ability of actors to create new actors with which they can exchange communications, along with the ability to include the addresses of other actors in messages, gives actors the ability to create and participate in arbitrarily variable topological relationships with one another, much as the objects in Simula and other object-oriented languages may also be relationally composed into variable topologies of message-exchanging objects.\n\n===Inherently concurrent===\nAs opposed to the previous approach based on composing sequential processes, the actor model was developed as an inherently concurrent model. In the actor model sequentiality was a special case that derived from concurrent computation as explained in [[actor model theory]].\n\n===No requirement on order of message arrival===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nHewitt argued against adding the requirement that messages must arrive in the order in which they are sent to the actor. If output message ordering is desired, then it can be modeled by a queue actor that provides this functionality. Such a queue actor would queue the messages that arrived so that they could be retrieved in [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] order. So if an actor <tt>X</tt> sent a message <tt>M1</tt> to an actor <tt>Y</tt>, and later <tt>X</tt> sent another message <tt>M2</tt> to <tt>Y</tt>, there is no requirement that <tt>M1</tt> arrives at <tt>Y</tt> before <tt>M2</tt>.\n\nIn this respect the actor model mirrors [[packet switching]] systems which do not guarantee that packets must be received in the order sent. Not providing the order of delivery guarantee allows packet switching to buffer packets, use multiple paths to send packets, resend damaged packets, and to provide other optimizations.\n\nFor example, actors are allowed to pipeline the processing of messages. What this means is that in the course of processing a message <tt>M1</tt>, an actor can designate the behavior to be used to process the next message, and then in fact begin processing another message <tt>M2</tt> before it has finished processing <tt>M1</tt>. Just because an actor is allowed to pipeline the processing of messages does not mean that it ''must'' pipeline the processing. Whether a message is pipelined is an engineering tradeoff. How would an external observer know whether the processing of a message by an actor has been pipelined? There is no ambiguity in the definition of an actor created by the possibility of pipelining. Of course, it is possible to perform the pipeline optimization incorrectly in some implementations, in which case unexpected behavior may occur.\n\n===Locality===\nAnother important characteristic of the actor model is locality.\n\nLocality means that in processing a message, an actor can send messages only to addresses that it receives in the message, addresses that it already had before it received the message, and addresses for actors that it creates while processing the message. (But see [[#Synthesizing addresses of actors|Synthesizing addresses of actors]].)\n\nAlso locality means that there is no simultaneous change in multiple locations. In this way it differs from some other models of concurrency, ''e.g.'', the [[Petri net]] model in which tokens are simultaneously removed from multiple locations and placed in other locations.\n\n===Composing actor systems===\nThe idea of composing actor systems into larger ones is an important aspect of [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] that was developed in Gul Agha's doctoral dissertation,<ref name=\"agha1986\"/> developed later by Gul Agha, Ian Mason, Scott Smith, and [[Carolyn Talcott]].<ref name=\"agha1993\"/>\n\n===Behaviors===\nA key innovation was the introduction of ''behavior'' specified as a mathematical function to express what an actor does when it processes a message, including specifying a new behavior to process the next message that arrives. Behaviors provided a mechanism to mathematically model the sharing in concurrency.\n\nBehaviors also freed the actor model from implementation details, ''e.g.'', the Smalltalk-72 token stream interpreter. However, it is critical to understand that the efficient implementation of systems described by the actor model require ''extensive'' optimization. See [[Actor model implementation]] for details.\n\n=== Modeling other concurrency systems ===\nOther concurrency systems (''e.g.'', [[process calculi]]) can be modeled in the actor model using a [[two-phase commit protocol]].<ref>Frederick Knabe. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frederick_Knabe/publication/2823488_A_Distributed_Protocol_for_Channel-Based_Communication_with_Choice/links/00463536b853ab72ef000000.pdf A Distributed Protocol for Channel-Based Communication with Choice PARLE 1992].</ref>\n\n=== Computational Representation Theorem ===\n{{see also|Denotational semantics of the Actor model}}\nThere is a ''Computational Representation Theorem'' in the actor model for systems which are closed in the sense that they do not receive communications from outside. The mathematical denotation denoted by a closed system <tt>S</tt> is constructed from an initial behavior <tt>\u22a5<sub>S</sub></tt> and a behavior-approximating function <tt>'''progression'''<sub>S</sub></tt>. These obtain increasingly better approximations and construct a denotation (meaning) for <tt>S</tt> as follows [Hewitt 2008; Clinger 1981]:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{Denote}_{\\mathtt{S}} \\equiv \\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\mathbf{progression}_{\\mathtt{S}^i}(\\bot_\\mathtt{S})</math>\n\nIn this way, <tt>S</tt> can be mathematically characterized in terms of all its possible behaviors (including those involving unbounded nondeterminism). Although <tt>Denote<sub>S</sub></tt> is not an implementation of <tt>S</tt>, it can be used to prove a generalization of the Church-Turing-Rosser-Kleene thesis [Kleene 1943]:\n\nA consequence of the above theorem is that a finite actor can nondeterministically respond with an {{clarify span|uncountable|reason=Uncountability is the property of real numbers, this sounds like (countably) infinite was meant|date=November 2013}} number of different outputs.\n\n===Relationship to logic programming===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nOne of the key motivations for the development of the actor model was to understand and deal with the control structure issues that arose in development of the [[Planner programming language]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Once the actor model was initially defined, an important challenge was to understand the power of the model relative to [[Robert Kowalski]]'s thesis that \"computation can be subsumed by deduction\". Hewitt argued that Kowalski's thesis turned out to be false for the concurrent computation in the actor model (see [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation]]).\n\nNevertheless, attempts were made to extend [[logic programming]] to concurrent computation. However, Hewitt and Agha [1991] claimed that the resulting systems were not deductive in the following sense: computational steps of the concurrent logic programming systems do not follow deductively from previous steps (see [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation]]). Recently, logic programming has been integrated into the actor model in a way that maintains logical semantics.<ref name=\"zenil\"/>\n\n===Migration===\nMigration in the actor model is the ability of actors to change locations. ''E.g.'', in his dissertation, Aki Yonezawa modeled a post office that customer actors could enter, change locations within while operating, and exit. An actor that can migrate can be modeled by having a location actor that changes when the actor migrates. However the faithfulness of this modeling is controversial and the subject of research.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Security===\nThe security of actors can be protected in the following ways:\n* [[Hardwired control|hardwiring]] in which actors are physically connected\n* [[computer hardware]] as in [[Burroughs B5000]], [[Lisp machine]], ''etc.''\n* [[virtual machines]] as in [[Java virtual machine]], [[Common Language Runtime]], ''etc.''\n* [[operating systems]] as in [[capability-based security|capability-based systems]]\n* [[Digital signature|signing]] and/or [[encryption]] of actors and their addresses\n\n===Synthesizing addresses of actors===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nA delicate point in the actor model is the ability to synthesize the address of an actor. In some cases security can be used to prevent the synthesis of addresses (see [[#Security|Security]]). However, if an actor address is simply a bit string then clearly it can be synthesized although it may be difficult or even infeasible to guess the address of an actor if the bit strings are long enough. [[SOAP]] uses a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] for the address of an endpoint where an actor can be reached. Since a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] is a character string, it can clearly be synthesized although encryption can make it virtually impossible to guess.\n\nSynthesizing the addresses of actors is usually modeled using mapping. The idea is to use an actor system to perform the mapping to the actual actor addresses. For example, on a computer the memory structure of the computer can be modeled as an actor system that does the mapping. In the case of [[SOAP]] addresses, it's modeling the [[Domain Name System|DNS]] and the rest of the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] mapping.\n\n===Contrast with other models of message-passing concurrency===\n[[Robin Milner]]'s initial published work on concurrency<ref>Robin Milner. Processes: A Mathematical Model of Computing Agents in Logic Colloquium 1973.</ref> was also notable in that it was not based on composing sequential processes. His work differed from the actor model because it was based on a fixed number of processes of fixed topology communicating numbers and strings using synchronous communication. The original [[communicating sequential processes]] (CSP) model<ref>C.A.R. Hoare. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359585&dl=GUIDE&coll=GUIDE&CFID=19884966&CFTOKEN=55490895 Communicating sequential processes] CACM. August 1978.</ref> published by [[Tony Hoare]] differed from the actor model because<!-- redundant --> it was based on the parallel composition of a fixed number of sequential processes connected in a fixed topology, and communicating using synchronous message-passing based on process names (see [[Actor model and process calculi history#Early work|Actor model and process calculi history]]). Later versions of CSP abandoned communication based on process names in favor of anonymous communication via channels, an approach also used in Milner's work on the [[calculus of communicating systems]] and the [[\u03c0-calculus]].\n\nThese early models by Milner and Hoare both had the property of bounded nondeterminism. Modern, theoretical CSP ([Hoare 1985] and [Roscoe 2005]) explicitly provides unbounded nondeterminism.\n\n[[Petri nets]] and their extensions (e.g., coloured Petri nets) are like actors in that they are based on asynchronous message passing and unbounded nondeterminism, while they are like early CSP in that they define fixed topologies of elementary processing steps (transitions) and message repositories (places).\n\n==Influence==\nThe actor model has been influential on both theory development and practical software development.\n\n===Theory===\nThe actor model has influenced the development of the [[\u03c0-calculus]] and subsequent [[process calculi]]. In his Turing lecture, Robin Milner wrote:<ref>{{cite journal|title=Elements of interaction |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=36 |pages=78\u201389 |doi=10.1145/151233.151240 |year=1993 |last1=Milner |first1=Robin}}</ref>\n<blockquote>Now, the pure lambda-calculus is built with just two kinds of thing: terms and variables. Can we achieve the same economy for a process calculus? Carl Hewitt, with his actors model, responded to this challenge long ago; he declared that a value, an operator on values, and a process should all be the same kind of thing: an actor.\nThis goal impressed me, because it implies the homogeneity and completeness of expression ... But it was long before I could see how to attain the goal in terms of an algebraic calculus...\nSo, in the spirit of Hewitt, our first step is to demand that all things denoted by terms or accessed by names\u2014values, registers, operators, processes, objects\u2014are all of the same kind of thing; they should all be processes.</blockquote>\n\n===Practice===\nThe actor model has had extensive influence on commercial practice. For example, Twitter has used actors for scalability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://waimingmok.wordpress.com/2009/06/27/how-twitter-is-scaling/ |title=How Twitter Is Scaling \u00ab Waiming Mok's Blog |publisher=Waimingmok.wordpress.com |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref> Also, Microsoft has used the actor model in the development of its Asynchronous Agents Library.<ref>\"[https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/623b6c0f-c229-4fcd-8a9d-a5ef24c60db9 Actor-Based Programming with the Asynchronous Agents Library]\" MSDN September 2010.</ref> There are many other actor libraries listed in the actor libraries and frameworks section below.\n\n==Addressed issues==\nAccording to Hewitt [2006], the actor model addresses issues in computer and communications architecture, [[concurrent programming language]]s, and [[Web service]]s including the following:\n* [[Scalability]]: the challenge of scaling up concurrency both locally and nonlocally.\n* [[Location transparency|Transparency]]: bridging the chasm between local and nonlocal concurrency. Transparency is currently a controversial issue. Some researchers {{Who|date=June 2010}} have advocated a strict separation between local concurrency using concurrent programming languages (e.g., [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) from nonlocal concurrency using [[SOAP]] for [[Web service]]s. Strict separation produces a lack of transparency that causes problems when it is desirable/necessary to change between local and nonlocal access to Web services (see [[Distributed computing]]).\n* [[Inconsistency]]: inconsistency is the norm because all very large knowledge systems about human information system interactions are inconsistent. This inconsistency extends to the documentation and specifications of very large systems (e.g., Microsoft Windows software, etc.), which are internally inconsistent.\n\nMany of the ideas introduced in the actor model are now also finding application in [[multi-agent systems]] for these same reasons [Hewitt 2006b 2007b]. The key difference is that agent systems (in most definitions) impose extra constraints upon the actors, typically requiring that they make use of commitments and goals.\n\n== Programming with actors ==\nA number of different programming languages employ the actor model or some variation of it. These languages include:\n\n===Early actor programming languages===\n\n* Act 1, 2 and 3<ref>{{cite journal\n |author    = Henry Lieberman\n |title     = A Preview of Act 1\n |date      = June 1981\n |publisher = MIT AI memo 625\n |hdl     = 1721.1/6350\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |author    = Henry Lieberman\n |title     = Thinking About Lots of Things at Once without Getting Confused: Parallelism in Act 1\n |date      = June 1981\n |publisher = MIT AI memo 626\n |hdl     = 1721.1/6351\n }}</ref>\n*Acttalk<ref>Jean-Pierre Briot.

McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from [[Margaret Thatcher]] onwards had cultivated a close relationship with [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between [[David Cameron]] and [[Rebekah Brooks]] (n\u00e9e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ...

In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the ''Daily Mail'' and ''News of the World'', particularly [[Andy Coulson]], had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from [[Margaret Thatcher]] onwards had cultivated a close relationship with [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between [[David Cameron]] and [[Rebekah Brooks]] (n\u00e9e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament \u2013 that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nWhen asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] to \"drag their feet\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: \"20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nGrant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his \"turning the tables\" on a tabloid journalist.<ref name=\"Guardian-2011-04-16\" />\n\nWhilst the allegations regarding the ''News of the World'' continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on [[BBC Radio 4]]) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered [[Millie Dowler]] had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage.

{"title_page": "Network socket", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nA '''network socket''' is an internal endpoint for sending or receiving data within a [[Node (networking)|node]] on a [[computer network]]. Concretely, it is a representation of this endpoint in networking software ([[protocol stack]]), such as an entry in a table (listing communication protocol, destination, status, etc.), and is a form of [[system resource]].\n\nThe term ''socket'' is analogous to physical [[female connector]]s, communication between two nodes through a [[Communication channel|channel]] being visualized as a cable with two [[male connector]]s plugging into sockets at each node. Similarly, the term ''[[port (computer networking)|port]]'' (another term for a female connector) is used for ''external'' endpoints at a node, and the term ''socket'' is also used for an internal endpoint of local [[inter-process communication]] (IPC) (not over a network). However, the analogy is limited, as network communication need not be one-to-one or have a dedicated [[communication channel]].\n\n==Use==\nA [[Process (computing)|process]] can refer to a socket using a ''socket descriptor'', a type of [[Handle (computing)|handle]]. A process first requests that the protocol stack create a socket, and the stack returns a descriptor to the process so it can identify the socket. The process then passes the descriptor back to the protocol stack when it wishes to send or receive data using this socket.\n\nUnlike [[port (computer networking)|port]]s, sockets are specific to one node; they are local resources and cannot be referred to directly by other nodes. Further, sockets are not necessarily associated with a persistent connection (channel) for communication between two nodes, nor is there necessarily some single other endpoint. For example, a [[datagram socket]] can be used for [[connectionless communication]], and a [[multicast]] socket can be used to send to multiple nodes. However, in practice for [[internet]] communication, sockets are generally used to connect to a specific endpoint and often with a persistent connection.\n\n== Socket addresses ==\nIn practice, ''socket'' usually refers to a socket in an [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) network (where a socket may be called an '''Internet socket'''), in particular for the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), which is a protocol for one-to-one connections. In this context, sockets are assumed to be associated with a specific '''socket address''', namely the [[IP address]] and a [[port number]] for the local node, and there is a corresponding socket address at the foreign node (other node), which itself has an associated socket, used by the foreign process. Associating a socket with a socket address is called ''binding''.\n\nNote that while a local process can communicate with a foreign process by sending or receiving data to or from a foreign ''socket address'', it does not have access to the foreign ''socket'' itself, nor can it use the foreign ''socket descriptor'', as these are both internal to the foreign node. For example, in a connection between 10.20.30.40:4444[A] and 50.60.70.80:8888[B] (local IP address:local port, foreign IP address:foreign port), there will also be an associated socket at each end, corresponding to the internal representation of the connection by the protocol stack on that node. These are referred to locally by numerical socket descriptors, say 317 at one side[A] and 922 at the other[B]. A process on node 10.20.30.40[A] can request to communicate with node 50.60.70.80[B] on port 8888 (request that the protocol stack create a socket to communicate with that destination), and once it[A] has created a socket and received a socket descriptor (317), it[A] can communicate via this socket by using the descriptor (317). The protocol stack will then forward data to and from node 50.60.70.80[B] on port 8888. Assuming that the foreign process at node B already received a socket descriptor(922), communication can now take place between node A and B. However, a process on node 10.20.30.40[A] cannot request to communicate based on the foreign socket descriptor, (e.g. \"socket 922\" or \"socket 922 on node 50.60.70.80[B]\") as these are internal to the foreign node and are not usable by the protocol stack on node 10.20.30.40[A].\n\n== Implementation ==\nA [[protocol stack]], today usually provided by the [[operating system]] (rather than as a separate library, for instance), is a set of services that allow processes to communicate over a network using the protocols that the stack implements. The operating system forwards the payload of incoming IP packets to the corresponding application by extracting the socket address information from the IP and transport protocol headers and stripping the headers from the application data.\n\nThe [[application programming interface]] (API) that programs use to communicate with the protocol stack, using network sockets, is called a '''socket API'''. Development of application programs that utilize this API is called ''socket programming'' or ''[[Computer network programming|network programming]]''. Internet socket APIs are usually based on the [[Berkeley sockets]] standard. In the Berkeley sockets standard, sockets are a form of [[file descriptor]], due to the [[Unix philosophy]] that \"everything is a file\", and the analogies between sockets and files. Both have functions to read, write, open, and close. In practice the differences strain the analogy, and different interfaces (send and receive) are used on a socket. In [[inter-process communication]], each end generally has its own socket.\n\nIn the standard Internet protocols TCP and UDP, a socket address is the combination of an [[IP address]] and a [[port number]], much like one end of a telephone connection is the combination of a [[phone number]] and a particular [[Extension (telephone)|extension]]. Sockets need not have a source address, for example, for only sending data, but if a program ''binds'' a socket to a source address, the socket can be used to receive data sent to that address. Based on this address, Internet sockets deliver incoming [[data packet]]s to the appropriate application [[process (computing)|process]].\n\n''Socket'' often refers specifically to an internet socket or TCP socket. An internet socket is minimally characterized by the following:\n* local socket address, consisting of the local IP address and (for TCP and UDP, but not IP) a port number\n* protocol: A transport protocol, e.g., TCP, UDP, raw IP. This means that (local or remote) endpoints with TCP port 53 and UDP port 53 are distinct sockets, while IP does not have ports.\n* A socket that has been connected to another socket, e.g., during the establishment of a TCP connection, also has a remote socket address.\n\n==Definition==\nThe distinctions between a socket (internal representation), socket descriptor (abstract identifier), and socket address (public address) are subtle, and these are not always distinguished in everyday usage. Further, specific definitions of a ''socket'' differ between authors. In [[IETF]] [[Request for Comments]], [[Internet Standard]]s, in many textbooks, as well as in this article, the term ''socket'' refers to an entity that is uniquely identified by the socket number. In other textbooks,<ref>Cisco Networking Academy Program, CCNA 1 and 2 Companion Guide Revised Third Edition, P.480, {{ISBN|1-58713-150-1}}</ref> the term ''socket'' refers to a local socket address, i.e. a \"combination of an IP address and a port number\". In the original definition of ''socket'' given in RFC 147, as it was related to the [[ARPANET|ARPA network]] in 1971, ''\"the socket is specified as a 32 bit number with even sockets identifying receiving sockets and odd sockets identifying sending sockets.\"'' Today, however, socket communications are bidirectional.\n \nWithin the operating system and the application that created a socket, a socket is referred to by a unique integer value called a ''socket descriptor''.\n\n==Tools==\nOn Unix-like operating systems and [[Microsoft Windows]], the command-line tools [[netstat]] or ''ss''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.linux.com/learn/intro-to-linux/2017/7/introduction-ss-command |title=An Introduction to the ss Command |author=Jack Wallen |date=2019-01-22}}</ref> are used to list established sockets and related information.\n\n==Example==\nThis example, modeled according to the Berkeley socket interface, sends the string \"Hello, world!\" via [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] to port 80 of the host with address 1.2.3.4. It illustrates the creation of a socket (getSocket), connecting it to the remote host, sending the string, and finally closing the socket:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\nSocket mysocket = getSocket(type = \"TCP\")\nconnect(mysocket, address = \"1.2.3.4\", port = \"80\")\nsend(mysocket, \"Hello, world!\")\nclose(mysocket)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Types==\nSeveral types of Internet socket are available:\n;Datagram sockets\n:[[Connectionless]] sockets, which use [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP).<ref>{{citation|title=Computer Networks|author=V.

A stream socket provides a [[sequenced]] and unique flow of error-free data without record boundaries, with well-defined mechanisms for creating and destroying connections and reporting errors. A stream socket transmits data [[Reliability (computer networking)|reliably]], in order, and with [[Out-of-band data|out-of-band]] capabilities. On the Internet, stream sockets are typically implemented using TCP so that applications can run across any networks using TCP/IP protocol.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n;Raw sockets\n:Allow direct sending and receiving of IP packets without any protocol-specific transport layer formatting. With other types of sockets, the [[payload (computing)|payload]] is automatically [[Encapsulation (networking)|encapsulated]] according to the chosen transport layer protocol (e.g. TCP, UDP), and the socket user is unaware of the existence of protocol [[Header (computing)|headers]] that are broadcast with the payload. When reading from a raw socket, the headers are usually included.  When transmitting packets from a raw socket, the automatic addition of a header is optional.\n:Most socket [[application programming interface]]s (APIs), for example those based on [[Berkeley sockets]], support raw sockets. [[Windows XP]] was released in 2001 with raw socket support implemented in the [[Winsock]] interface, but three years later, Microsoft limited Winsock's raw socket support because of security concerns.<ref>Ian Griffiths for IanG on Tap. 12 August 2004.

One use case for raw sockets is the implementation of new transport-layer protocols in [[user space]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linux.die.net/man/7/raw|title=raw(7): IPv4 raw sockets - Linux man page|work=die.net}}</ref> Raw sockets are typically available in network equipment, and used for [[routing protocol]]s such as the [[Internet Group Management Protocol]] (IGMPv4) and [[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF), and in the [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP) used, among other things, by the [[ping utility]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/internet/tcp-ip/raw-ip-faq/|title=Raw IP Networking FAQ|work=faqs.org}}</ref>\n\nOther socket types are implemented over other transport protocols, such as [[Systems Network Architecture]] (SNA).<ref>[http://www-306.ibm.com/software/network/commserver/library/publications/csaix_60/dzgl1m61.htm www-306.ibm.com - AnyNet Guide to Sockets over SNA]</ref> See also [[Unix domain socket]]s (UDS), for internal inter-process communication.\n\n==Socket states in the client-server model==\nComputer processes that provide application services are referred to as [[Server (computing)|servers]], and create sockets on start up that are in ''listening state''. These sockets are waiting for initiatives from [[Client (computing)|client]] programs.\n\nA TCP server may serve several clients concurrently, by creating a child process for each client and establishing a TCP connection between the child process and the client. Unique ''dedicated sockets'' are created for each connection. These are in ''established'' state when a socket-to-socket [[virtual connection]] or virtual circuit (VC), also known as a TCP [[Session (computer science)|session]], is established with the remote socket, providing a duplex [[byte stream]].\n\nA server may create several concurrently established TCP sockets with the same local port number and local IP address, each mapped to its own server-child process, serving its own client process. They are treated as different sockets by the operating system, since the remote socket address (the client IP address and/or port number) are different; i.e. since they have different [[#Socket pairs|socket pair]] tuples.\n\nA UDP socket cannot be in an established state, since UDP is [[connectionless]]. Therefore, <tt>netstat</tt> does not show the state of a UDP socket. A UDP server does not create new child processes for every concurrently served client, but the same process handles incoming data packets from all remote clients sequentially through the same socket. It implies that UDP sockets are not identified by the remote address, but only by the local address, although each message has an associated remote address.\n\n==Socket pairs==\nCommunicating local and remote sockets are called '''socket pairs'''. Each socket pair is described by a unique [[4-tuple]] consisting of source and destination IP addresses and port numbers, i.e. of local and remote socket addresses.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ptSC4LpwGA0C&pg=PA52&dq=socket+pair+tuple books.google.com - UNIX Network Programming: The sockets networking API]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lyY-7VEo9j8C&pg=PA52&dq=socket+pair books.google.com - Designing BSD Rootkits: An Introduction to Kernel Hacking]</ref> As seen in the discussion above, in the TCP case, each unique socket pair 4-tuple is assigned a socket number, while in the UDP case, each unique local socket address is assigned a socket number.\n\n==History==\nThe term ''socket'' dates to RFC 147 (1971), where it was used in ARPANET. Today most implementations of sockets are based on [[Berkeley sockets]] (1983), for the internet, such as [[Winsock]] (1991). Other API implementations exist, such as the [[Streams (networking API)|STREAMS]]-based [[Transport Layer Interface]] (TLI).\n\nIn 1983, [[Berkeley sockets]], also known as the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] socket API, originated with the 4.2BSD [[Unix]] [[operating system]] (released in 1983) as an API.  Only in 1989, however, could [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] release versions of its operating system and networking library free from the licensing constraints of [[AT&T]]'s copyright-protected [[Unix]].\n\nIn 1987, the TLI was the networking application programming interface provided by [[AT&T]] [[UNIX System V]] Release 3 (SVR3).<ref>{{harv|Goodheart|1994|p=11}}</ref> and continued into Release 4 (SVR4).<ref>{{harv|Goodheart|1994|p=17}}</ref>\n\nOther early implementations were written for <!--DEC-->[[TOPS-20]],<ref name=\"hcc98\">[http://www.historyofcomputercommunications.info/Book/9/9.8_TCP-IP-XNS81-83.html historyofcomputercommunications.info - Book: 9.8 TCP/IP and XNS 1981 - 1983]</ref> <!--IBM-->[[MVS]],<ref name=\"hcc98\"/> [[VM (operating system)|VM]],<ref name=\"hcc98\"/> [[IBM PC DOS|IBM-DOS]] (PCIP)<!--DOSv2.0-->.<ref name=\"hcc98\"/><ref>[http://groups.csail.mit.edu/ana/Publications/PubPDFs/The%20Desktop%20Computer%20as%20a%20Network%20Participant.pdf mit.edu - The Desktop Computer as a Network Participant.pdf] 1985<!--4/11--></ref>\n<!-- IBM/DEC/HP implementations?-->\n\n==Sockets in network equipment==\nThe socket is primarily a concept used in the transport layer of the [[Internet protocol suite|Internet model]]. Networking equipment such as [[Router (computing)|router]]s and [[Network switch|switch]]es do not require implementations of the transport layer, as they operate on the [[link layer]] level (switches) or at the [[internet layer]] (routers). However, stateful [[network firewall]]s, [[network address translator]]s, and proxy servers keep track of active socket pairs. Also in [[fair queuing]], [[layer 3 switching]] and [[quality of service]] (QoS) support in routers, [[packet flow]]s may be identified by extracting information about the socket pairs. [[Raw socket]]s are typically available in network equipment and are used for [[routing protocol]]s such as [[IGRP]] and [[OSPF]], and in [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers]]\n* [[Promiscuous traffic]]\n* [[WebSocket]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v7r1m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Frzab6%2Fhowdosockets.htm How sockets work] - IBM information center\n* [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0858/d27611d7a90c221beb5106e63721aeaed810.pdf Server Programming with TCP/IP Sockets]\n* [http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/ Beej's Guide to Network Programming]\n* [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/networking/overview/networking.html Java Tutorials: Networking basics]\n* [http://metacpan.org/module/Net::RawIP Net::RawIP; module for Perl applications.] Created by [https://web.archive.org/web/20050623074557/http://www.ic.al.lg.ua/~ksv/ Sergey Kolychev].\n* Network Programming for Microsoft Windows ({{ISBN|0-7356-1579-9}})\n* [http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2004/08/12/213611.aspx A little more info on raw sockets and Windows XP SP2 - Michael Howard's Web Log] an indication of what's actually allowed on Windows.\n* [http://sock-raw.org/papers/sock_raw SOCK_RAW Demystified: article describing inner workings of Raw Sockets]\n*[http://www.pdbuchan.com/rawsock/rawsock.html C language examples of Linux raw sockets for IPv4 and IPv6] - David Buchan's C language examples of IPv4 and IPv6 raw sockets for Linux.\n\n{{Inter-process communication}}\n\n[[Category:Network socket| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nA '''network socket''' is an internal endpoint for sending or receiving data within a [[Node (networking)|node]] on a [[computer network]]. Concretely, it is a representation of this endpoint in networking software ([[protocol stack]]), such as an entry in a table (listing communication protocol, destination, status, etc.), and is a form of [[system resource]].\n\nThe term ''socket'' is analogous to physical [[female connector]]s, communication between two nodes through a [[Communication channel|channel]] being visualized as a cable with two [[male connector]]s plugging into sockets at each node. Similarly, the term ''[[port (computer networking)|port]]'' (another term for a female connector) is used for ''external'' endpoints at a node, and the term ''socket'' is also used for an internal endpoint of local [[inter-process communication]] (IPC) (not over a network). However, the analogy is limited, as network communication need not be one-to-one or have a dedicated [[communication channel]].\n\n==Use==\nA [[Process (computing)|process]] can refer to a socket using a ''socket descriptor'', a type of [[Handle (computing)|handle]]. A process first requests that the protocol stack create a socket, and the stack returns a descriptor to the process so it can identify the socket. The process then passes the descriptor back to the protocol stack when it wishes to send or receive data using this socket.\n\nUnlike [[port (computer networking)|port]]s, sockets are specific to one node; they are local resources and cannot be referred to directly by other nodes. Further, sockets are not necessarily associated with a persistent connection (channel) for communication between two nodes, nor is there necessarily some single other endpoint. For example, a [[datagram socket]] can be used for [[connectionless communication]], and a [[multicast]] socket can be used to send to multiple nodes. However, in practice for [[internet]] communication, sockets are generally used to connect to a specific endpoint and often with a persistent connection.\n\n== Socket addresses ==\nIn practice, ''socket'' usually refers to a socket in an [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) network (where a socket may be called an '''Internet socket'''), in particular for the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), which is a protocol for one-to-one connections. In this context, sockets are assumed to be associated with a specific '''socket address''', namely the [[IP address]] and a [[port number]] for the local node, and there is a corresponding socket address at the foreign node (other node), which itself has an associated socket, used by the foreign process. Associating a socket with a socket address is called ''binding''.\n\nNote that while a local process can communicate with a foreign process by sending or receiving data to or from a foreign ''socket address'', it does not have access to the foreign ''socket'' itself, nor can it use the foreign ''socket descriptor'', as these are both internal to the foreign node. For example, in a connection between 10.20.30.40:4444[A] and 50.60.70.80:8888[B] (local IP address:local port, foreign IP address:foreign port), there will also be an associated socket at each end, corresponding to the internal representation of the connection by the protocol stack on that node. These are referred to locally by numerical socket descriptors, say 317 at one side[A] and 922 at the other[B]. A process on node 10.20.30.40[A] can request to communicate with node 50.60.70.80[B] on port 8888 (request that the protocol stack create a socket to communicate with that destination), and once it[A] has created a socket and received a socket descriptor (317), it[A] can communicate via this socket by using the descriptor (317). The protocol stack will then forward data to and from node 50.60.70.80[B] on port 8888. Assuming that the foreign process at node B already received a socket descriptor(922), communication can now take place between node A and B. However, a process on node 10.20.30.40[A] cannot request to communicate based on the foreign socket descriptor, (e.g. \"socket 922\" or \"socket 922 on node 50.60.70.80[B]\") as these are internal to the foreign node and are not usable by the protocol stack on node 10.20.30.40[A].\n\n== Implementation ==\nA [[protocol stack]], today usually provided by the [[operating system]] (rather than as a separate library, for instance), is a set of services that allow processes to communicate over a network using the protocols that the stack implements. The operating system forwards the payload of incoming IP packets to the corresponding application by extracting the socket address information from the IP and transport protocol headers and stripping the headers from the application data.\n\nThe [[application programming interface]] (API) that programs use to communicate with the protocol stack, using network sockets, is called a '''socket API'''. Development of application programs that utilize this API is called ''socket programming'' or ''[[Computer network programming|network programming]]''. Internet socket APIs are usually based on the [[Berkeley sockets]] standard. In the Berkeley sockets standard, sockets are a form of [[file descriptor]], due to the [[Unix philosophy]] that \"everything is a file\", and the analogies between sockets and files. Both have functions to read, write, open, and close. In practice the differences strain the analogy, and different interfaces (send and receive) are used on a socket. In [[inter-process communication]], each end generally has its own socket.\n\nIn the standard Internet protocols TCP and UDP, a socket address is the combination of an [[IP address]] and a [[port number]], much like one end of a telephone connection is the combination of a [[phone number]] and a particular [[Extension (telephone)|extension]].

One use case for raw sockets is the implementation of new transport-layer protocols in [[user space]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linux.die.net/man/7/raw|title=raw(7): IPv4 raw sockets - Linux man page|work=die.net}}</ref> Raw sockets are typically available in network equipment, and used for [[routing protocol]]s such as the [[Internet Group Management Protocol]] (IGMPv4) and [[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF), and in the [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP) used, among other things, by the [[ping utility]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/internet/tcp-ip/raw-ip-faq/|title=Raw IP Networking FAQ|work=faqs.org}}</ref>\n\nOther socket types are implemented over other transport protocols, such as [[Systems Network Architecture]] (SNA).<ref>[http://www-306.ibm.com/software/network/commserver/library/publications/csaix_60/dzgl1m61.htm www-306.ibm.com - AnyNet Guide to Sockets over SNA]</ref> See also [[Unix domain socket]]s (UDS), for internal inter-process communication.\n\n==Socket states in the client-server model==\nComputer processes that provide application services are referred to as [[Server (computing)|servers]], and create sockets on start up that are in ''listening state''. These sockets are waiting for initiatives from [[Client (computing)|client]] programs.\n\nA TCP server may serve several clients concurrently, by creating a child process for each client and establishing a TCP connection between the child process and the client. Unique ''dedicated sockets'' are created for each connection. These are in ''established'' state when a socket-to-socket [[virtual connection]] or virtual circuit (VC), also known as a TCP [[Session (computer science)|session]], is established with the remote socket, providing a duplex [[byte stream]].\n\nA server may create several concurrently established TCP sockets with the same local port number and local IP address, each mapped to its own server-child process, serving its own client process. They are treated as different sockets by the operating system, since the remote socket address (the client IP address and/or port number) are different; i.e. since they have different [[#Socket pairs|socket pair]] tuples.\n\nA UDP socket cannot be in an established state, since UDP is [[connectionless]]. Therefore, <tt>netstat</tt> does not show the state of a UDP socket. A UDP server does not create new child processes for every concurrently served client, but the same process handles incoming data packets from all remote clients sequentially through the same socket. It implies that UDP sockets are not identified by the remote address, but only by the local address, although each message has an associated remote address.\n\n==Socket pairs==\nCommunicating local and remote sockets are called '''socket pairs'''. Each socket pair is described by a unique [[4-tuple]] consisting of source and destination IP addresses and port numbers, i.e. of local and remote socket addresses.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ptSC4LpwGA0C&pg=PA52&dq=socket+pair+tuple books.google.com - UNIX Network Programming: The sockets networking API]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lyY-7VEo9j8C&pg=PA52&dq=socket+pair books.google.com - Designing BSD Rootkits: An Introduction to Kernel Hacking]</ref> As seen in the discussion above, in the TCP case, each unique socket pair 4-tuple is assigned a socket number, while in the UDP case, each unique local socket address is assigned a socket number.\n\n==History==\nThe term ''socket'' dates to RFC 147 (1971), where it was used in ARPANET. Today most implementations of sockets are based on [[Berkeley sockets]] (1983), for the internet, such as [[Winsock]] (1991). Other API implementations exist, such as the [[Streams (networking API)|STREAMS]]-based [[Transport Layer Interface]] (TLI).\n\nIn 1983, [[Berkeley sockets]], also known as the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] socket API, originated with the 4.2BSD [[Unix]] [[operating system]] (released in 1983) as an API.  Only in 1989, however, could [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] release versions of its operating system and networking library free from the licensing constraints of [[AT&T]]'s copyright-protected [[Unix]].\n\nIn 1987, the TLI was the networking application programming interface provided by [[AT&T]] [[UNIX System V]] Release 3 (SVR3).<ref>{{harv|Goodheart|1994|p=11}}</ref> and continued into Release 4 (SVR4).<ref>{{harv|Goodheart|1994|p=17}}</ref>\n\nOther early implementations were written for <!--DEC-->[[TOPS-20]],<ref name=\"hcc98\">[http://www.historyofcomputercommunications.info/Book/9/9.8_TCP-IP-XNS81-83.html historyofcomputercommunications.info - Book: 9.8 TCP/IP and XNS 1981 - 1983]</ref> <!--IBM-->[[MVS]],<ref name=\"hcc98\"/> [[VM (operating system)|VM]],<ref name=\"hcc98\"/> [[IBM PC DOS|IBM-DOS]] (PCIP)<!--DOSv2.0-->.<ref name=\"hcc98\"/><ref>[http://groups.csail.mit.edu/ana/Publications/PubPDFs/The%20Desktop%20Computer%20as%20a%20Network%20Participant.pdf mit.edu - The Desktop Computer as a Network Participant.pdf] 1985<!--4/11--></ref>\n<!-- IBM/DEC/HP implementations?-->\n\n==Sockets in network equipment==\nThe socket is primarily a concept used in the transport layer of the [[Internet protocol suite|Internet model]]. Networking equipment such as [[Router (computing)|router]]s and [[Network switch|switch]]es do not require implementations of the transport layer, as they operate on the [[link layer]] level (switches) or at the [[internet layer]] (routers). However, stateful [[network firewall]]s, [[network address translator]]s, and proxy servers keep track of active socket pairs. Also in [[fair queuing]], [[layer 3 switching]] and [[quality of service]] (QoS) support in routers, [[packet flow]]s may be identified by extracting information about the socket pairs. [[Raw socket]]s are typically available in network equipment and are used for [[routing protocol]]s such as [[IGRP]] and [[OSPF]], and in [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers]]\n* [[Promiscuous traffic]]\n* [[WebSocket]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v7r1m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Frzab6%2Fhowdosockets.htm How sockets work] - IBM information center\n* [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0858/d27611d7a90c221beb5106e63721aeaed810.pdf Server Programming with TCP/IP Sockets]\n* [http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/ Beej's Guide to Network Programming]\n* [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/networking/overview/networking.html Java Tutorials: Networking basics]\n* [http://metacpan.org/module/Net::RawIP Net::RawIP; module for Perl applications.] Created by [https://web.archive.org/web/20050623074557/http://www.ic.al.lg.ua/~ksv/ Sergey Kolychev].\n* Network Programming for Microsoft Windows ({{ISBN|0-7356-1579-9}})\n* [http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2004/08/12/213611.aspx A little more info on raw sockets and Windows XP SP2 - Michael Howard's Web Log] an indication of what's actually allowed on Windows.\n* [http://sock-raw.org/papers/sock_raw SOCK_RAW Demystified: article describing inner workings of Raw Sockets]\n*[http://www.pdbuchan.com/rawsock/rawsock.html C language examples of Linux raw sockets for IPv4 and IPv6] - David Buchan's C language examples of IPv4 and IPv6 raw sockets for Linux.\n{{IPC}}\n\n[[Category:Network socket| ]]\n", "name_user": "Zyxw", "label": "safe", "comment": "update link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket"}

The album was used to promote Cosgrove's [[About You Now#Miranda Cosgrove version|single of the same name]], released in the final quarter of 2008. Aside from featuring remixes of previous promotional singles of Cosgrove's, the album also featured two tracks, \"FYI\" and \"Party Girl\". It is a cover of the [[Sugababes]] hit single of the same name. It did, however, help boost sales of the single, \"[[About You Now]]\". The single became Cosgrove's second song to chart on [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart, peaking at number 47, her highest peak to date. The single also became her first single to chart internationally, peaking at number 79 in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nCosgrove promoted the single and the accompanying album mainly through interviews and performances. Cosgrove performed \"About You Now\" at the 2009 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]]. The single was also performed on ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'', along with some of Cosgrove's songs from her official debut studio album, ''[[Sparks Fly (album)|Sparks Fly]]''. The other songs were the lead single, \"[[Kissin U]]\", as well as the album's second track, \"BAM\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Beavers |first=Danielle |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1591500/20080724/cosgrove__miranda.jhtml |title=Miranda Cosgrove Plans Solo Album After Conquering TV And Web With 'iCarly' - News Story &#124; Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV News |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref>\n\n==Background and development==\nCosgrove's musical career first began with her recording the theme song of the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] television series ''[[iCarly]]'' called \"[[Leave It All to Me]]\", on which Cosgrove stars as the [[Carly Shay|title character]] on the show. The song features her former ''[[Drake & Josh]]'' castmate [[Drake Bell]], and was written by [[Michael Corcoran]], one of Bell's band members. Following the success of ''iCarly'', [[Columbia Records]] released a [[ICarly (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] of the show on June 10, 2008. The soundtrack album included four songs recorded by Cosgrove that were \"[[Leave It All to Me]]\", \"[[Stay My Baby#Miranda Cosgrove version|Stay My Baby]]\", \"[[About You Now#Miranda Cosgrove version|About You Know]]\" and \"Headphones On\". Cosgrove stated, \"Before that, I didn't see myself making an album, but when I spent time in the studio doing the theme song and saw how much fun it was, I wanted to go back.\"<ref name=\"billboard.com\">[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958313/miranda-cosgrove-makes-sparks-fly-with-top-10-debut Miranda Cosgrove Makes Sparks Fly With Top 10 Debut] Billboard.com</ref>\n\nIn July 2008, she officially announced plans for a debut album, stating that the album was \"different\" from her contributions to the [[iCarly (soundtrack)|''iCarly'' soundtrack]], with her \"co-writing and getting really into it\",<ref>{{cite web|last=Beavers |first=Danielle |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1591500/20080724/cosgrove__miranda.jhtml |title=Miranda Cosgrove Plans Solo Album After Conquering TV And Web With 'iCarly' - News Story &#124; Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV News |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> and saying that \"[I'm] playing a character on ''iCarly'', but this shows more of myself. Some people might think I'm just another actress putting out an album, but I wanted to prove that I'm more than that.\"<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/> The album took two years to make, with [[Columbia Records]]' marketing manager Chris Poppe stating in May 2010 that \"Miranda started working on [the album] at 14, and she's 16 now. The difference between those two ages is huge, and the songs have had to grow along with her.\"<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/> On February 5, 2009, Cosgrove released her debut solo recording; the 5-song [[Extended play|EP]] ''About You Now'' exclusively onto the [[iTunes Store]]. The EP included the title track \"[[About You Now#Miranda Cosgrove version|About You Now]]\", a [[remix]] of it, a remix of \"[[Stay My Baby#Miranda Cosgrove version|Stay My Baby]]\", \"F.Y.I.\" and \"Party Girl\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailyvault.com/toc.php5?review=6138 |title=The Daily Vault Music Reviews : About You Now (EP) |publisher=Dailyvault.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nThe first track on the album is \"[[About You Now#Miranda Cosgrove version|About You Now]]\". Musically, the song is a mid-tempo [[pop-rock]] track, that follows a [[Verse-chorus form|verse]] to [[refrain|chorus]] guideline. The song, a cover of the [[Sugababes]] hit single, lyrically speaks of a girl who is over a fight her and her intimate other had, and now knows how she feels \"about him now\". The single has proven to be a hit for Cosgrove in the US. On the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the single is her highest peaking so to date, currently holding a peak of number 47. The single has also been her most successful in the [[United Kingdom]], where it debuted and peaked at number 97. \"[[About You Now#Miranda Cosgrove version|About You Now]]\" was also featured on the hit compilation album, ''[[Now That's What I Call Music! 30 (U.S. series)|Now That's What I Call Music! 30]]''. \"FYI\" is the second song on the album. Musically, the song is an uptempo [[punk rock]] type of song, that lyrically speaks of Cosgrove's romantic feelings for someone, and the song follows Cosgrove expressing her feelings for him in the lyrics. \"Party Girl\", the third track on the album, has more of a pop feel than the rest of the album. Musically, it is an uptemp pop song, that lyrically speaks of Cosgrove's longing to party and hang out with her friends. \n\nAlso included on the [[extended play]] are two remixes. The first of these is the spider remix of \"[[Stay My Baby#Miranda Cosgrove version|Stay My Baby]]\", a promotional single recently released by Cosgrove from the soundtrack to her ''[[iCarly]]'' television series. The song, originally a ballad, has now been given a pop and dance beat. Lyrically, the song speaks of Cosgrove knowing that everything will be okay, as long as he \"stays her baby\". The final track on the album is the Spider Remix of \"[[About You Now#Miranda Cosgrove version|About You Now]]\". The new version of the album has removed the guitar from the song and replaced it with more of an [[electropop]] type of sound.\n\n==Critical reception==\nCommonsensemedia stated that \"While Cosgrove's acting career has advanced considerably, her singing sounds similar to her passable vocal performance in School of Rock. Problem is, that was six years ago, when Cosgrove was nine years old. As a result, the synth-pop pattern that pervades so much of today's tween music doesn't come across as well for Cosgrove as it does for other bubblegum popsters with slightly stronger voices, like [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Jordan McCoy]]. No doubt her TV popularity will still draw fans to this EP, but the release won't go down as one of the better ones in tween-music history.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/music-reviews/about-you-now |title=About You Now by Miranda Cosgrove - Music Review |publisher=Commonsensemedia.org |date=2009-01-30 |accessdate=2011-03-15}}</ref> In their review of the album, The Daily Vault stated \"As it turns out, Cosgrove is tackling non-tween material, trying to convince her adult listeners she's not as young as you might think. She wants to go back in time to a previous point in her relationship with the subject in the disc's title track since she \"knows how I feel about you now.\" She sings about how girls \"dig rejection\" and how she'd rather \"rock, that's how I roll\" in \"FYI.\" Finally, in the third original track on this EP, she spouts on and on about how \"you can take the rock out of the roll but you can't take the party out of the girl\" in \"Party Girl.\" Finally, in \"Stay My Baby,\" she speculates about being in a long distance relationship when \"she's back at school,\" which I infer as being college? So, Cosgrove is tackling adult problems while singing to a tween audience.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailyvault.com/toc.php5?review=6138 |title=The Daily Vault Music Reviews : About You Now (EP) |publisher=Dailyvault.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Promotion and performances==\nThe song \"[[About You Now]]\" was first performed live during the 2008 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].

The song features her former ''[[Drake & Josh]]'' castmate [[Drake Bell]], and was written by [[Michael Corcoran]], one of Bell's band members. Following the success of ''iCarly'', [[Columbia Records]] released a [[ICarly (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] of the show on June 10, 2008. The soundtrack album included four songs recorded by Cosgrove that were \"[[Leave It All to Me]]\", \"[[Stay My Baby#Miranda Cosgrove version|Stay My Baby]]\", \"[[About You Now#Miranda Cosgrove version|About You Know]]\" and \"Headphones On\". Cosgrove stated, \"Before that, I didn't see myself making an album, but when I spent time in the studio doing the theme song and saw how much fun it was, I wanted to go back.\"<ref name=\"billboard.com\">[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958313/miranda-cosgrove-makes-sparks-fly-with-top-10-debut Miranda Cosgrove Makes Sparks Fly With Top 10 Debut] Billboard.com</ref>\n\nIn July 2008, she officially announced plans for a debut album, stating that the album was \"different\" from her contributions to the [[iCarly (soundtrack)|''iCarly'' soundtrack]], with her \"co-writing and getting really into it\",<ref>{{cite web|last=Beavers |first=Danielle |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1591500/20080724/cosgrove__miranda.jhtml |title=Miranda Cosgrove Plans Solo Album After Conquering TV And Web With 'iCarly' - News Story &#124; Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV News |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> and saying that \"[I'm] playing a character on ''iCarly'', but this shows more of myself. Some people might think I'm just another actress putting out an album, but I wanted to prove that I'm more than that.\"<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/> The album took two years to make, with [[Columbia Records]]' marketing manager Chris Poppe stating in May 2010 that \"Miranda started working on [the album] at 14, and she's 16 now. The difference between those two ages is huge, and the songs have had to grow along with her.\"<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/> On February 5, 2009, Cosgrove released her debut solo recording; the 5-song [[Extended play|EP]] ''About You Now'' exclusively onto the [[iTunes Store]]. The EP included the title track \"[[About You Now#Miranda Cosgrove version|About You Now]]\", a [[remix]] of it, a remix of \"[[Stay My Baby#Miranda Cosgrove version|Stay My Baby]]\", \"F.Y.I.\" and \"Party Girl\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailyvault.com/toc.php5?review=6138 |title=The Daily Vault Music Reviews : About You Now (EP) |publisher=Dailyvault.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nThe first track on the album is \"[[About You Now#Miranda Cosgrove version|About You Now]]\". Musically, the song is a mid-tempo [[pop-rock]] track, that follows a [[Verse-chorus form|verse]] to [[refrain|chorus]] guideline. The song, a cover of the [[Sugababes]] hit single, lyrically speaks of a girl who is over a fight her and her intimate other had, and now knows how she feels \"about him now\". The single has proven to be a hit for Cosgrove in the US. On the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the single is her highest peaking so to date, currently holding a peak of number 47. The single has also been her most successful in the [[United Kingdom]], where it debuted and peaked at number 97. \"[[About You Now#Miranda Cosgrove version|About You Now]]\" was also featured on the hit compilation album, ''[[Now That's What I Call Music! 30 (U.S. series)|Now That's What I Call Music! 30]]''. \"FYI\" is the second song on the album. Musically, the song is an uptempo [[punk rock]] type of song, that lyrically speaks of Cosgrove's romantic feelings for someone, and the song follows Cosgrove expressing her feelings for him in the lyrics. \"Party Girl\", the third track on the album, has more of a pop feel than the rest of the album. Musically, it is an uptemp pop song, that lyrically speaks of Cosgrove's longing to party and hang out with her friends. \n\nAlso included on the [[extended play]] are two remixes. The first of these is the spider remix of \"[[Stay My Baby#Miranda Cosgrove version|Stay My Baby]]\", a promotional single recently released by Cosgrove from the soundtrack to her ''[[iCarly]]'' television series. The song, originally a ballad, has now been given a pop and dance beat. Lyrically, the song speaks of Cosgrove knowing that everything will be okay, as long as he \"stays her baby\". The final track on the album is the Spider Remix of \"[[About You Now#Miranda Cosgrove version|About You Now]]\". The new version of the album has removed the guitar from the song and replaced it with more of an [[electropop]] type of sound.\n\n==Critical reception==\nCommonsensemedia stated that \"While Cosgrove's acting career has advanced considerably, her singing sounds similar to her passable vocal performance in School of Rock. Problem is, that was six years ago, when Cosgrove was nine years old. As a result, the synth-pop pattern that pervades so much of today's tween music doesn't come across as well for Cosgrove as it does for other bubblegum popsters with slightly stronger voices, like [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Jordan McCoy]]. No doubt her TV popularity will still draw fans to this EP, but the release won't go down as one of the better ones in tween-music history.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/music-reviews/about-you-now |title=About You Now by Miranda Cosgrove - Music Review |publisher=Commonsensemedia.org |date=2009-01-30 |accessdate=2011-03-15}}</ref> In their review of the album, The Daily Vault stated \"As it turns out, Cosgrove is tackling non-tween material, trying to convince her adult listeners she's not as young as you might think. She wants to go back in time to a previous point in her relationship with the subject in the disc's title track since she \"knows how I feel about you now.\" She sings about how girls \"dig rejection\" and how she'd rather \"rock, that's how I roll\" in \"FYI.\" Finally, in the third original track on this EP, she spouts on and on about how \"you can take the rock out of the roll but you can't take the party out of the girl\" in \"Party Girl.\" Finally, in \"Stay My Baby,\" she speculates about being in a long distance relationship when \"she's back at school,\" which I infer as being college?

Invented by the [[Germany|German]] physicist [[August Toepler]] in 1864 to study [[supersonic]] motion, it is widely used in [[aeronautical engineering]] to photograph the flow of air around objects.\n\n== Classical optical system==\nThe classical implementation of an optical schlieren system uses light from a single [[collimated]] source shining on, or from behind, a target object. Variations in [[refractive index]] caused by [[density gradient]]s in the fluid distort the collimated light beam. This distortion creates a spatial variation in the [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] of the light, which can be visualised directly with a [[shadowgraph]] system.\n\nIn classical schlieren photography, the collimated light is focused with a converging optical element (usually a lens or curved mirror), and a knife edge is placed at the focal point, positioned to block about half the light. In flow of uniform density this will simply make the photograph half as bright. However, in flow with density variations, the distorted beam focuses imperfectly, and parts that have been focused in an area covered by the knife edge are blocked. The result is a set of lighter and darker patches corresponding to positive and negative fluid density gradients in the direction [[normal (geometry)|normal]] to the knife edge. When a knife edge is used, the system is generally referred to as a ''schlieren system'', which measures the first derivative of density in the direction of the knife edge. If a knife edge is not used, the system is generally referred to as a ''[[shadowgraph]] system'', which measures the second derivative of density.\n\nIf the fluid flow is uniform, the image will be steady, but any [[turbulence]] will cause [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillation]], the shimmering effect that can be seen on hot surfaces on a sunny day. To visualise instantaneous density profiles, a short-duration [[Flash (photography)|flash]] (rather than continuous illumination) may be used.\n\n== Focusing schlieren optical system ==\nIn the mid 20th century, R.&nbsp;A. Burton developed an alternative form of schlieren photography, which is now usually called ''focusing schlieren'' or ''lens-and-grid schlieren'',<ref>{{cite journal | last=Burton | first=Ralph A. | title=A Modified Schlieren Apparatus for Large Areas of Field | journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America | publisher=The Optical Society | volume=39 | issue=11 | date=1949-11-01 | issn=0030-3941 | doi=10.1364/josa.39.000907 | pmid=15393811 | page=907}}</ref> based on a suggestion by [[Hubert Schardin]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Schardin | first=Hubert | title=Ergebnisse der Exakten Naturwissenschaften | chapter=Die Schlierenverfahren und ihre Anwendungen | publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg | location=Berlin, Heidelberg | isbn=978-3-540-77206-4 | doi=10.1007/bfb0111981 |volume=20| pages=303\u2013439| year=1942 }}</ref> Focusing schlieren systems generally retain the characteristic knife edge to produce contrast, but instead of using collimated light and a single knife edge, they use an illumination pattern of repeated edges with a focusing imaging system.\n[[File:Schlieren optics.svg|alt=|center|frame|Basic diagram of a focusing schlieren system]]\nThe basic idea is that the illumination pattern is imaged onto a geometrically congruent cutoff pattern (essentially a multiplicity of knife edges) with focusing optics, while density gradients lying between the illumination pattern and the cutoff pattern are imaged, typically by a camera system. As in classical schlieren, the distortions produce regions of brightening or darkening corresponding to the position and direction of the distortion, because they redirect rays either away from or onto the opaque part of the cutoff pattern. While in classical schlieren, distortions over the whole beam path are visualized equally, in focusing schlieren, only distortions in the object field of the camera are clearly imaged. Distortions away from the object field become blurred, so this technique allows some degree of depth selection. It also has the advantage that a wide variety of illuminated backgrounds can be used, since collimation is not required. This allows construction of projection-based focusing schlieren systems, which are much easier to build and align than classical schlieren systems. The requirement of collimated light in classical schlieren is often a substantial practical barrier for constructing large systems due to the need for the collimating optic to be the same size as the field of view. Focusing schlieren systems can use compact optics with a large background illumination pattern, which is particularly easy to produce with a projection system. For systems with large demagnification, the illumination pattern needs to be around twice larger than the field of view to allow defocusing of the background pattern.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Goulding|first=J.

In these techniques, the background and the schlieren object (the distortion to be visualized) are both in focus and the distortion is detected because it moves part of the background image relative to its original position. Because of this focus requirement, they tend to be used for large-scale applications where both the schlieren object and the background are distant (typically beyond the [[hyperfocal distance]] of the optical system). Since these systems require no additional optics aside from a camera, they are often the simplest to construct but they are usually not as sensitive as other types of schlieren systems, with the sensitivity being limited by the camera resolution. The technique also requires a suitable background image. In some cases, the background may be provided by the experimenter, such as a random speckle pattern or sharp line, but naturally occurring features such as landscape or even the edge of the Sun have been used. Background-oriented schlieren is most often performed using software techniques such as [[digital image correlation]] and [[optical flow]] analysis to perform [[synthetic schlieren]], but it is possible to achieve the same effect in [[High-speed photography#Streak photography|streak imaging]] with an analog optical system.\n\n== Variations and applications ==\nVariations on the optical schlieren method include the replacement of the knife-edge by a coloured target, resulting in ''rainbow schlieren'' which can assist in visualising the flow. Different edge configurations such as concentric rings can also give sensitivity to variable gradient directions, and programmable digital edge generation has been demonstrated as well using digital displays and modulators. The [[adaptive optics]] [[pyramid wavefront sensor]] is a modified form of schlieren (having two perpendicular knife edges formed by the vertices of a refracting square pyramid).\n\nComplete schlieren optical systems can be built from components, or bought as commercially available instruments. Details of theory and operation are given in Settles' 2001 book.<ref>{{cite book | last=Settles | first=G.

Refractive index gradients can be caused either by changes of temperature/pressure of the same fluid or by the variations of the concentration of components in mixtures and solutions. A typical application in gas dynamics is the study of shock waves in ballistics and supersonic or hypersonic vehicles.

To visualise instantaneous density profiles, a short-duration [[Flash (photography)|flash]] (rather than continuous illumination) may be used.\n\n== Focusing schlieren optical system ==\nIn the mid 20th century, R.&nbsp;A. Burton developed an alternative form of schlieren photography, which is now usually called ''focusing schlieren'' or ''lens-and-grid schlieren'',<ref>{{cite journal | last=Burton | first=Ralph A. | title=A Modified Schlieren Apparatus for Large Areas of Field | journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America | publisher=The Optical Society | volume=39 | issue=11 | date=1949-11-01 | issn=0030-3941 | doi=10.1364/josa.39.000907 | pmid=15393811 | page=907}}</ref> based on a suggestion by [[Hubert Schardin]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Schardin | first=Hubert | title=Ergebnisse der Exakten Naturwissenschaften | chapter=Die Schlierenverfahren und ihre Anwendungen | publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg | location=Berlin, Heidelberg | isbn=978-3-540-77206-4 | doi=10.1007/bfb0111981 |volume=20| pages=303\u2013439| year=1942 }}</ref> Focusing schlieren systems generally retain the characteristic knife edge to produce contrast, but instead of using collimated light and a single knife edge, they use an illumination pattern of repeated edges with a focusing imaging system.\n[[File:Schlieren optics.svg|alt=|center|frame|Basic diagram of a focusing schlieren system]]\nThe basic idea is that the illumination pattern is imaged onto a geometrically congruent cutoff pattern (essentially a multiplicity of knife edges) with focusing optics, while density gradients lying between the illumination pattern and the cutoff pattern are imaged, typically by a camera system. As in classical schlieren, the distortions produce regions of brightening or darkening corresponding to the position and direction of the distortion, because they redirect rays either away from or onto the opaque part of the cutoff pattern. While in classical schlieren, distortions over the whole beam path are visualized equally, in focusing schlieren, only distortions in the object field of the camera are clearly imaged. Distortions away from the object field become blurred, so this technique allows some degree of depth selection. It also has the advantage that a wide variety of illuminated backgrounds can be used, since collimation is not required. This allows construction of projection-based focusing schlieren systems, which are much easier to build and align than classical schlieren systems. The requirement of collimated light in classical schlieren is often a substantial practical barrier for constructing large systems due to the need for the collimating optic to be the same size as the field of view. Focusing schlieren systems can use compact optics with a large background illumination pattern, which is particularly easy to produce with a projection system. For systems with large demagnification, the illumination pattern needs to be around twice larger than the field of view to allow defocusing of the background pattern.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Goulding|first=J.

In these techniques, the background and the schlieren object (the distortion to be visualized) are both in focus and the distortion is detected because it moves part of the background image relative to its original position. Because of this focus requirement, they tend to be used for large-scale applications where both the schlieren object and the background are distant (typically beyond the [[hyperfocal distance]] of the optical system). Since these systems require no additional optics aside from a camera, they are often the simplest to construct but they are usually not as sensitive as other types of schlieren systems, with the sensitivity being limited by the camera resolution. The technique also requires a suitable background image. In some cases, the background may be provided by the experimenter, such as a random speckle pattern or sharp line, but naturally occurring features such as landscape or even the edge of the Sun have been used. Background-oriented schlieren is most often performed using software techniques such as [[digital image correlation]] and [[optical flow]] analysis to perform [[synthetic schlieren]], but it is possible to achieve the same effect in [[High-speed photography#Streak photography|streak imaging]] with an analog optical system.\n\n== Variations and applications ==\nVariations on the optical schlieren method include the replacement of the knife-edge by a coloured target, resulting in ''rainbow schlieren'' which can assist in visualising the flow. Different edge configurations such as concentric rings can also give sensitivity to variable gradient directions, and programmable digital edge generation has been demonstrated as well using digital displays and modulators. The [[adaptive optics]] [[pyramid wavefront sensor]] is a modified form of schlieren (having two perpendicular knife edges formed by the vertices of a refracting square pyramid).\n\nComplete schlieren optical systems can be built from components, or bought as commercially available instruments. Details of theory and operation are given in Settles' 2001 book.<ref>{{cite book | last=Settles | first=G.

Refractive index gradients can be caused either by changes of temperature/pressure of the same fluid or by the variations of the concentration of components in mixtures and solutions. A typical application in gas dynamics is the study of shock waves in ballistics and supersonic or hypersonic vehicles.

[[Linux]] implements a large subset of messages:\n* Link layer: ''RTM_NEWLINK'', ''RTM_DELLINK'', ''RTM_GETLINK'', ''RTM_SETLINK''\n* Address settings: ''RTM_NEWADDR'', ''RTM_DELADDR'', ''RTM_GETADDR''\n* Routing tables: ''RTM_NEWROUTE'', ''RTM_DELROUTE'', ''RTM_GETROUTE''\n* Neighbor cache: ''RTM_NEWNEIGH'', ''RTM_DELNEIGH'', ''RTM_GETNEIGH''\n* Routing rules: ''RTM_NEWRULE'', ''RTM_DELRULE'', ''RTM_GETRULE''\n* Queuing discipline settings: ''RTM_NEWQDISC'', ''RTM_DELQDISC'', ''RTM_GETQDISC''\n* Traffic classes used with queues: ''RTM_NEWTCLASS'', ''RTM_DELTCLASS'', ''RTM_GETTCLASS''\n* Traffic filters: ''RTM_NEWTFILTER'', ''RTM_DELTFILTER'', ''RTM_GETTFILTER''\n* Others: ''RTM_NEWACTION'', ''RTM_DELACTION'', ''RTM_GETACTION'', ''RTM_NEWPREFIX'', ''RTM_GETPREFIX'', ''RTM_GETMULTICAST'', ''RTM_GETANYCAST'', ''RTM_NEWNEIGHTBL'', ''RTM_GETNEIGHTBL'', ''RTM_SETNEIGHTBL''\n\n; NETLINK_FIREWALL\n{{code|NETLINK_FIREWALL}} provides an interface for a user-space app to receive packets from the [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]].\n\n; NETLINK_NFLOG\n{{code|NETLINK_NFLOG}} provides an interface used to communicate between [[Netfilter]] and [[iptables]].\n\n; NETLINK_ARPD\n{{code|NETLINK_ARPD}} provides an interface to manage the [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] table from user-space.\n\n; NETLINK_AUDIT\n{{code|NETLINK_AUDIT}} provides an interface to the audit subsystem found in Linux kernel versions 2.6.6 and later.\n\n; NETLINK_IP6_FW\n{{code|NETLINK_IP6_FW}} provides an interface to transport packets from netfilter to user-space.\n\n; NETLINK_ROUTE6\n\n; NETLINK_TAPBASE\n\n; NETLINK_NETFILTER\n\n; NETLINK_TCPDIAG\n\n; NETLINK_XFRM\n{{code|NETLINK_XFRM}} provides an interface to manage the [[IPsec]] [[security association]] and security policy databases - mostly used by key-manager daemons using the [[Internet Key Exchange]] protocol.\n\n; NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT\n{{code|NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT}} provides the interface in which the kernel broadcasts uevents, typically consumed by [[udev]].\n\n; NETLINK_GENERIC\nOne of the drawbacks of the Netlink protocol is that the number of protocol families is limited to 32 ({{code|MAX_LINKS}}).This is one of the main reasons that the generic Netlink family was created\u2014to provide support for adding a higher number of families. It acts as a Netlink multiplexer and works with a single Netlink family {{code|NETLINK_GENERIC}}. The generic Netlink protocol is based on the Netlink protocol and uses its API.\n\n===User-defined Netlink protocol===\nUsers can add a Netlink handler in their own kernel routines. This allows the development of additional Netlink protocols to address new kernel modules.<ref>[https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7356 Why and How to Use Netlink Sockets]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Computer programming|Free and open-source software|Linux}}\n* [[Comparison of open-source wireless drivers]] \u2013 [http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/Documentation/mac80211 mac80211]-based drivers rely on Netlink as the API to user space\n* [[POSIX]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110902031641/http://1984.lsi.us.es/~pablo/docs/spae.pdf Pablo Neira Ayuso, Rafael M.

Being touted as a party-game, it enables players to create their character, then use the [[Wii Remote]] and a microphone to sing and dance through it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ea-reveals-boogie|title=EA reveals Boogie|last=Purchese|first=Rob|date=2007-03-22|website=[[Eurogamer]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131214929/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ea-reveals-boogie|archive-date=2009-01-31}}</ref> Each song within the game can be performed either as a [[karaoke]] or as a [[dance|dancing]] game. The game is based around an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] theme. It was one of the first games released in Brazil for the Wii. Although anticipation was high for the game, it received negative reviews.\n\nThe game was followed by a sequel, ''[[Boogie Superstar]]'', in 2008.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Wii boogie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In-game screenshot of Boogie]]\nThe karaoke gameplay is similar to other singing games such as ''[[SingStar]]'' and ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]''. The game comes packaged with a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] [[microphone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://au.ign.com/articles/2007/05/04/boogie-hands-on-2|title=Boogie Hands-on|last=Harris|first=Craig|date=2007-05-04|publisher=IGN|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120002701/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/04/boogie-hands-on-2|archive-date=2016-01-20|accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref> To score, the player must sing in time and in tune with the lyrics as they scroll at the bottom of the screen, with a musical staff to indicate the correct pitch and where the player's current pitch is. Rather than using [[phonetics|phonetic]] detection, the game bases the score on how well the player matches the rhythm and pitch.\n\nThe dancing portion uses the [[Wii Remote]] and optionally the Nunchuk attachment. As the song plays, the player must move the remote left, right, down or up in time with the beat of the song to earn points. Like EA's ''[[SSX (series)|SSX]]'' games, repeating the same movements will reduce the player's score, so the player must continually string together different orders of movements, as well as changing the dancing style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/ooga-booga/boogie-hands+on-new-screens-257774.php|title=Boogie Hands-On, New Screens|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=2007-05-04|website=[[Kotaku]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509013526/http://kotaku.com/gaming/ooga-booga/boogie-hands%2Bon-new-screens-257774.php|archive-date=2007-05-09}}</ref> A \"boogie meter\" fills with successful dance steps and strings of dance steps. While filled, the player can attempt a special dance move by holding down a button on the remote and then following the exact order of steps (4 to 6 steps long) that comes up. Successful execution of these steps in order and in time with the music will perform that move, while failure will detract some of the boogie meter. The player can move about the dance floor, picking up tokens, score multipliers, and boogie meter boosts when they appear. If the Nunchuk is used, the player will be given special solo sections where they can control the character's facial expression while a phrase of music goes by. Additionally, the user can enter a \"Strike a Pose\" mode, requiring them to tilt the Nunchunk to have the on-screen character point at an ever-decreasing set of targets for additional points. While the player can also use the basic dancing controls in karaoke mode, these do not affect the score there.\n\nDuring the story mode, covering five chapters for each of the five characters in the game, the player can only advance after achieving a minimum score on the game. In regular play mode, their score is rated against pre-set scores for performances, and are rewarded with tokens for how good the performance was. Tokens can be used in the in-game store to unlock additional songs, stages, and outfits for character customization.\n\nPlayers have the ability to create music videos of regular performances, which can include switching camera positions and adding screen effects.\n\n''Boogie'' features competitive and co-operative local multiplayer modes.\n\nIt was announced by [[Electronic Arts|EA]] on July 10, 2007 that there are 39 confirmed songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/10/pre-e3-2007-boogie-blasts-out-its-tunes|title=Pre-E3 2007: Boogie Blasts out its Tunes|last=Burman|first=Rob|date=2007-07-10|publisher=IGN|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806165858/http://wii.ign.com/articles/802/802717p1.html|archive-date=2012-08-06|accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref> All songs are [[cover version|cover]]s of the original tracks.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| state = collapsible\n| DS = true\n| WII = true\n| PS2 = true\n<!--Aggregate-->\n| MC_WII = 57/100<ref name=\"MetacriticWii\"/>\n| MC_DS = 58/100<ref name=\"MetacriticDS\"/>\n| MC_PS2 = 52/100<ref name=\"MetacriticPS2\"/>\n| GR_WII = 59%<ref name=\"GameRankingsWii\"/>\n| GR_DS = 60%<ref name=\"GameRankingsDS\"/>\n| GR_PS2 = 50%<ref name=\"GameRankingsPS2\"/>\n<!--Individual-->\n| 1UP_WII = 3.0/10<ref name=\"1UP\"/>\n| G4_WII = {{rating|1|5}}<ref name=\"G4tv\"/>\n| GamePro_WII = 4.0/5\n| GI_WII = 7.75/10\n| GSpot_WII = 5.5/10\n| IGN_WII = 4.5/10<ref name=\"IGN Wii\"/>\n| IGN_DS = 5.5/10<ref name=\"IGN DS\"/>\n| NP_WII = 5.5/10<ref name=\"NintendoPowerWii\"/>\n| NP_DS = 7.0/10<ref name=\"NintendoPowerDS\"/>\n| ONM_WII = 81%<ref name=\"ONMUK\"/>\n| OPMUK_PS2 = 5.0/10<ref name=\"POMUK\"/>\n}}\nDespite positive early reviews from the ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' and ''[[GamePro]]'', who gave it an 81% and a 4 out of 5 respectively,<ref name=\"ONMUK\">{{Cite magazine|date=September 2007|title=Boogie|magazine=[[Official Nintendo Magazine UK]]|page=66}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamepro.com/nintendo/wii/games/reviews/127849.shtml|title=Review: Boogie|date=2007-10-11|website=[[GamePro]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011162348/http://gamepro.com/nintendo/wii/games/reviews/127849.shtml|archivedate=2007-10-11|accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref> and also from ''[[Game Informer]]'', which gave it a 7.75 out of 10,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200710/R07.0809.1455.03980.htm|title=Boogie|last=Miller|first=Matt|website=[[Game Informer]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105214557/http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200710/R07.0809.1455.03980.htm|archivedate=2007-11-05|accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref> ''Boogie'' received negative reviews.

developed by [[Electronic Arts]] for the [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Nintendo DS]]. Being touted as a party-game, it enables players to create their character, then use the [[Wii Remote]] and a microphone to sing and dance through it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ea-reveals-boogie|title=EA reveals Boogie|last=Purchese|first=Rob|date=2007-03-22|website=[[Eurogamer]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131214929/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ea-reveals-boogie|archive-date=2009-01-31}}</ref> Each song within the game can be performed either as a [[karaoke]] or as a [[dance|dancing]] game. The game is based around an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] theme. It was one of the first games released in Brazil for the Wii. Although anticipation was high for the game, it received negative reviews.\n\nThe game was followed by a sequel, ''[[Boogie Superstar]]'', in 2008.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Wii boogie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In-game screenshot of Boogie]]\nThe karaoke gameplay is similar to other singing games such as ''[[SingStar]]'' and ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]''. The game comes packaged with a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] [[microphone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://au.ign.com/articles/2007/05/04/boogie-hands-on-2|title=Boogie Hands-on|last=Harris|first=Craig|date=2007-05-04|publisher=IGN|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120002701/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/04/boogie-hands-on-2|archive-date=2016-01-20|accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref> To score, the player must sing in time and in tune with the lyrics as they scroll at the bottom of the screen, with a musical staff to indicate the correct pitch and where the player's current pitch is. Rather than using [[phonetics|phonetic]] detection, the game bases the score on how well the player matches the rhythm and pitch.\n\nThe dancing portion uses the [[Wii Remote]] and optionally the Nunchuk attachment. As the song plays, the player must move the remote left, right, down or up in time with the beat of the song to earn points. Like EA's ''[[SSX (series)|SSX]]'' games, repeating the same movements will reduce the player's score, so the player must continually string together different orders of movements, as well as changing the dancing style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/ooga-booga/boogie-hands+on-new-screens-257774.php|title=Boogie Hands-On, New Screens|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=2007-05-04|website=[[Kotaku]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509013526/http://kotaku.com/gaming/ooga-booga/boogie-hands%2Bon-new-screens-257774.php|archive-date=2007-05-09}}</ref> A \"boogie meter\" fills with successful dance steps and strings of dance steps. While filled, the player can attempt a special dance move by holding down a button on the remote and then following the exact order of steps (4 to 6 steps long) that comes up. Successful execution of these steps in order and in time with the music will perform that move, while failure will detract some of the boogie meter. The player can move about the dance floor, picking up tokens, score multipliers, and boogie meter boosts when they appear. If the Nunchuk is used, the player will be given special solo sections where they can control the character's facial expression while a phrase of music goes by. Additionally, the user can enter a \"Strike a Pose\" mode, requiring them to tilt the Nunchunk to have the on-screen character point at an ever-decreasing set of targets for additional points. While the player can also use the basic dancing controls in karaoke mode, these do not affect the score there.\n\nDuring the story mode, covering five chapters for each of the five characters in the game, the player can only advance after achieving a minimum score on the game. In regular play mode, their score is rated against pre-set scores for performances, and are rewarded with tokens for how good the performance was. Tokens can be used in the in-game store to unlock additional songs, stages, and outfits for character customization.\n\nPlayers have the ability to create music videos of regular performances, which can include switching camera positions and adding screen effects.\n\n''Boogie'' features competitive and co-operative local multiplayer modes.\n\nIt was announced by [[Electronic Arts|EA]] on July 10, 2007 that there are 39 confirmed songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/10/pre-e3-2007-boogie-blasts-out-its-tunes|title=Pre-E3 2007: Boogie Blasts out its Tunes|last=Burman|first=Rob|date=2007-07-10|publisher=IGN|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806165858/http://wii.ign.com/articles/802/802717p1.html|archive-date=2012-08-06|accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref> All songs are [[cover version|cover]]s of the original tracks.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| state = collapsible\n| DS = true\n| WII = true\n| PS2 = true\n<!--Aggregate-->\n| MC_WII = 57/100<ref name=\"MetacriticWii\"/>\n| MC_DS = 58/100<ref name=\"MetacriticDS\"/>\n| MC_PS2 = 52/100<ref name=\"MetacriticPS2\"/>\n| GR_WII = 59%<ref name=\"GameRankingsWii\"/>\n| GR_DS = 60%<ref name=\"GameRankingsDS\"/>\n| GR_PS2 = 50%<ref name=\"GameRankingsPS2\"/>\n<!--Individual-->\n| 1UP_WII = 3.0/10<ref name=\"1UP\"/>\n| G4_WII = {{rating|1|5}}<ref name=\"G4tv\"/>\n| GamePro_WII = 4.0/5\n| GI_WII = 7.75/10\n| GSpot_WII = 5.5/10\n| IGN_WII = 4.5/10<ref name=\"IGN Wii\"/>\n| IGN_DS = 5.5/10<ref name=\"IGN DS\"/>\n| NP_WII = 5.5/10<ref name=\"NintendoPowerWii\"/>\n| NP_DS = 7.0/10<ref name=\"NintendoPowerDS\"/>\n| ONM_WII = 81%<ref name=ONMUK\"/>\n| OPMUK_PS2 = 5.0/10<ref name=\"POMUK\"/>\n}}\nDespite positive early reviews from the [[Official Nintendo Magazine|''Official Nintendo Magazine'']] and ''[[GamePro]]'', who gave it an 81% and a 4 out of 5 respectively,<ref name=ONMUK\">{{Cite magazine|date=September 2007|title=Boogie|magazine=[[Official Nintendo Magazine UK]]|page=66}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamepro.com/nintendo/wii/games/reviews/127849.shtml|title=Review: Boogie|date=2007-10-11|website=[[GamePro]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011162348/http://gamepro.com/nintendo/wii/games/reviews/127849.shtml|archivedate=2007-10-11|accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref> and also from ''[[Game Informer]]'', which gave it a 7.75 out of 10,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200710/R07.0809.1455.03980.htm|title=Boogie|last=Miller|first=Matt|website=[[Game Informer]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105214557/http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200710/R07.0809.1455.03980.htm|archivedate=2007-11-05|accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref> ''Boogie'' received negative reviews.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

D-Bus is important because it serves as an interprocess communication mechanism that allows desktop applications to talk to each other [...].\n}}\n</ref>)\nis a [[software bus]], [[inter-process communication]] (IPC), and [[remote procedure call]] (RPC) mechanism that allows communication between multiple [[Process (computing)|processes]] running concurrently on the same machine.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}} D-Bus was developed as part of the [[freedesktop.org]] project, initiated by [[Havoc Pennington]] from [[Red Hat]] to standardize services provided by [[Linux]] [[desktop environment]]s such as [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]].{{r|intro dbus q1}}{{r|Palmieri 2005}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe freedesktop.org project also developed a [[free and open-source]] software library called libdbus, as a [[reference implementation]] of the specification. This library should not be confused with the D-Bus itself, as other implementations of the D-Bus specification also exist, such as GDBus (GNOME),{{r|gdbus}} QtDBus ([[Qt (software)|Qt]]/KDE),{{r|qtdbus}} dbus-java{{r|dbus-java}} and sd-bus (part of [[systemd]]).{{r|Poettering 2015}}\n\n== Overview ==\nD-Bus is an IPC mechanism initially designed to replace the [[software component]] communications systems used by the [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] Linux [[desktop environment]]s ([[CORBA]] and [[DCOP]] respectively).{{r|dbus tut q1}}{{r|intro dbus q2}} The components of these desktop environments are normally distributed in many processes, each one providing only a few &mdash;usually one&mdash; ''services''. These services may be used by regular client [[application software|applications]] or by other components of the desktop environment to perform their tasks.{{multiple image\n | footer = Large groups of cooperating processes demand a dense mesh of individual communication channels (using one-to-one IPC methods) between them. D-Bus simplifies the IPC requirements with one single shared channel.\n | image1 = Processes without D-Bus.svg\n | alt1 = Processes without D-Bus\n | caption1 = Processes without D-Bus\n | image2 = Processes with D-Bus.svg\n | alt2 = Processes with D-Bus\n | caption2 = The same processes with D-Bus\n }}\n\nDue to the large number of processes involved &mdash;adding up processes providing the services and clients accessing them&mdash; establishing one-to-one IPC communications between all of them becomes an inefficient and quite unreliable{{Citation needed|reason=Comparative evaluation of reliability should be provided for this claim|date=October 2016}} approach. Instead, D-Bus provides a [[software bus|software-bus]] [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstraction]] that gathers all the communications between a group of processes over a single shared virtual channel.{{r|Cocagne 2012}} Processes connected to a bus don't know how it is internally implemented, but D-Bus specification guarantees that all processes connected to the bus can communicate with each other through it.\n\nLinux desktop environments take advantage of the D-Bus facilities by instantiating not one bus but many{{r|dbus spec}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}}{{r|dbus tut}}:\n* a single '''system bus''', available to all users and processes of the system, that provides access to system services (i.e. services provided by the [[operating system]] and also by any system [[daemon (computer software)|daemons]])\n* a '''session bus''' for each user login session, that provides desktop services to user applications in the same desktop session, and allows the integration of the desktop session as a whole\n\nA process can connect to any number of buses, provided that it has been granted access to them. In practice, this means that any user process can connect to the system bus and to its current session bus, but not to another user's session buses, or even to a different session bus owned by the same user. The latter restriction may change in the future if all user sessions are combined into a single user bus.{{r|Poettering 2015 q1}}\n\nD-Bus provides additional or simplifies existing functionality to the applications, including information-sharing, modularity and [[privilege separation]]. For example, information on an incoming voice-call received through [[Bluetooth]] or [[Skype]] can be propagated and interpreted by any currently-running music player, which can react by muting the volume or by pausing playback until the call is finished.{{r|Love 2005}}\n\nD-Bus can also be used as a [[Software framework|framework]] to integrate different components of a user application. For instance, an [[office suite]] can communicate through the session bus to share data between a [[word processor]] and a [[spreadsheet]].\n\n== D-Bus specification ==\n\n=== Bus model ===\nEvery connection to a bus is identified in the context of D-Bus by what is called a ''bus name''.{{r|intro dbus}} A bus name consists of two or more dot-separated strings of letters, digits, dashes, and underscores. An example of a valid bus name is {{code|org.freedesktop.NetworkManager}}.{{r|Cocagne 2012}}\n\nWhen a process sets up a connection to a bus, the bus assigns to the connection a special bus name called ''unique connection name''.{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}} Bus names of this type are immutable&mdash;it's guaranteed they won't change as long as the connection exists&mdash;and, more importantly, they can't be reused during the bus lifetime.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}} This means that no other connection to that bus will ever have assigned such unique connection name, even if the same process closes down the connection to the bus and creates a new one. Unique connection names are easily recognizable because they start with the&mdash;otherwise forbidden&mdash;colon character.{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}} An example of a unique connection name is {{code|:1.1553}} (the characters after the colon have no particular meaning{{r|dbus tut}}).\n\nA process can ask for additional bus names for its connection,{{r|dbus tut}} provided that any requested name is not already being used by another connection to the bus. In D-Bus parlance, when a bus name is assigned to a connection, it is said the connection ''owns'' the bus name.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}} In that sense, a bus name can't be owned by two connections at the same time, but, unlike unique connection names, these names can be reused if they are available: a process may reclaim a bus name released &mdash;purposely or not&mdash; by another process.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}}\n\nThe idea behind these additional bus names, commonly called ''well-known names'', is to provide a way to refer to a service using a prearranged bus name.{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}} For instance, the service that reports the current time and date in the system bus lies in the process whose connection owns the {{mono|org.freedesktop.timedate1}} bus name, regardless of which process it is.\n\nBus names can be used as a simple way to implement single instance applications (second instances detect that the bus name is already taken).{{r|dbus tut}} It can also be used to track a service process lifecycle, since the bus sends a notification when a bus name is released due to a process termination.{{r|dbus tut}}\n\n=== Object model ===\nBecause of its original conception as a replacement for several component oriented communications systems, D-Bus shares with its predecessors an object model in which to express the semantics of the communications between clients and services. The terms used in the D-Bus object model mimic those used by some [[object oriented]] [[programming language]]s. That doesn't mean that D-Bus is somehow limited to OOP languages &mdash;in fact, the most used implementation ({{mono|libdbus}}) is written in [[C (programming language)|C]], a [[procedural programming]] language.\n\n[[File:D-Feet.png|thumb|Browsing the existing bus names, objects, interfaces, methods and signals in a D-Bus bus using D-Feet]]\nIn D-Bus, a process offers its services by exposing ''objects''. These objects have ''methods'' that can be invoked, and ''signals'' that the object can emit.{{r|dbus tut}} Methods and signals are collectively referred to as the ''members'' of the object.{{r|intro dbus}} Any client connected to the bus can interact with an object by using its methods, making requests or commanding the object to perform actions.{{r|dbus tut}} For instance, an object representing a time service can be queried by a client using a method that returns the current date and time. A client can also listen to signals that an object emits when its state changes due to certain events, usually related to the underlying service. An example would be when a service that manages hardware devices &mdash;such as USB or network drivers&mdash; signals a \"new hardware device added\" event. Clients should instruct the bus that they are interested in receiving certain signals from a particular object, since a D-Bus bus only passes signals to those processes with a registered interest in them.{{r|Cocagne 2012}}\n\nA process connected to a D-Bus bus can request it to ''export'' as many D-Bus objects as it wants. Each object is identified by an ''object path'', a string of numbers, letters and underscores separated and prefixed by the slash character, called that because of their resemblance to [[Unix path|Unix filesystem paths]].{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}} The object path is selected by the requesting process, and must be unique in the context of that bus connection. An example of a valid object path is {{code|/org/kde/kspread/sheets/3/cells/4/5}}.{{r|dbus tut}} However, it's not enforced &mdash;but also not discouraged&mdash; to form hierarchies within object paths.{{r|Cocagne 2012}} The particular naming convention for the objects of a service is entirely up to the developers of such service, but many developers choose to [[namespace]] them using the reserved [[domain name]] of the project as a prefix (e.g. {{mono|/org/kde}}).{{r|dbus tut}}\n\nEvery object is inextricably associated to the particular bus connection where it was exported, and, from the D-Bus point of view, only lives in the context of such connection. Therefore, in order to be able to use a certain service, a client must indicate not only the object path providing the desired service, but also the bus name under which the service process is connected to the bus.{{r|intro dbus}} This in turn allows that several processes connected to the bus can export different objects with identical object paths unambiguously.\n\nMembers &mdash;methods and signals&mdash; that can be used with an object are specified by an ''interface''.{{r|dbus tut}} An ''interface'' is a set of declarations of methods (including its passing and returning parameters) and signals (including its parameters) identified by a dot-separated name resembling the [[Java (programming language)|Java language]] interfaces notation.{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}} An example of a valid interface name is {{code|org.freedesktop.Introspectable}}.{{r|Cocagne 2012}} Despite their similarity, interface names and bus names should not be mistaken. A D-Bus object can ''implement'' several interfaces, but at least must implement one, providing support for every method and signal defined by it. The combination of all interfaces implemented by an object is called the object ''type''.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}}\n\nWhen using an object, it's a good practice for the client process to provide the member's interface name besides the member's name, but is only mandatory when there is an ambiguity caused by duplicated member names available from different interfaces implemented by the object{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}} &mdash;otherwise, the selected member is undefined or erroneous. An emitted signal, on the other hand, must always indicate to which interface it belongs.\n\nThe D-Bus specification also defines several standard interfaces that objects may want to implement in addition to its own interfaces.{{r|dbus spec}} Although technically optional, most D-Bus service developers choose to support them in their exported objects since they offer important additional features to D-Bus clients, such as [[Type introspection|introspection]].{{r|Cocagne 2012}} These standard interfaces are:{{r|dbus spec}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}}\n* {{mono|org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer}}: provides a way to test if a D-Bus connection is alive.{{r|Cocagne 2012}}\n* {{mono|org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable}}: provides an introspection mechanism by which a client process can, at run-time, get a description (in [[XML]] format) of the interfaces, methods and signals that the object implements.{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|dbus spec}}\n* {{mono|org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties}}: allows a D-Bus object to expose the underlying native object [[Property (programming)|properties]] or attributes, or simulate them if it doesn't exist.{{r|dbus spec}}\n* {{mono|org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager}}: when a D-Bus service arranges its objects hierarchically, this interface provides a way to query an object about all sub-objects under its path, as well as their interfaces and properties, using a single method call.{{r|dbus spec}}\n\nThe D-Bus specification defines a number of administrative bus operations (called \"bus services\") to be performed using the {{mono|/org/freedesktop/DBus}} object that resides in the {{mono|org.freedesktop.DBus}} bus name.{{r|dbus spec}} Each bus reserves this special bus name for itself, and manages any requests made specifically to this combination of bus name and object path. The administrative operations provided by the bus are those defined by the object's interface {{mono|org.freedesktop.DBus}}. These operations are used for example to provide information about the status of the bus,{{r|intro dbus}} or to manage the request and release of additional ''well-known'' bus names.{{r|dbus spec}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}}\n\n=== Communications model ===\nD-Bus was conceived as a generic, high-level inter-process communication system. To accomplish such goals, D-Bus communications are based on the exchange of ''messages'' between processes instead of \"raw bytes\".{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}} D-Bus messages are high-level discrete items that a process can send through the bus to another connected process. Messages have a well-defined structure (even the types of the data carried in their payload are defined), allowing the bus to validate them and to reject any ill-formed message.\nIn this regard, D-Bus is closer to an [[Remote procedure call|RPC]] mechanism than to a classic IPC mechanism, with its own type definition system and its own [[Marshalling (computer science)|marshaling]].{{r|intro dbus}}\n\n[[File:D-Bus method invocation.svg|thumb|Example of one-to-one request-response message exchange to invoke a method over D-Bus. Here the client process invokes the {{mono|SetFoo()}} method of the {{mono|/org/example/object1}} object from the service process named {{mono|org.example.foo}} (or {{code|:1.14}}) in the bus.]]\nThe bus supports two modes of interchanging messages between a client and a service process{{r|intro dbus}}:\n* One-to-one [[request-response]]: This is the way for a client to invoke an object's method. The client sends a message to the service process exporting the object, and the service in turn replies with a message back to the client process.{{r|dbus tut}} The message sent by the client must contain the object path, the name of the invoked method (and optionally the name of its interface), and the values of the input parameters (if any) as defined by the object's selected interface. The reply message carries the result of the request, including the values of the output parameters returned by the object's method invocation, or ''exception'' information if there was an error.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}}\n* [[Publish/subscribe]]: This is the way for an object to announce the occurrence of a signal to the interested parties. The object's service process broadcasts a message that the bus passes only to the connected clients subscribed to the object's signal.{{r|dbus tut}} The message carries the object path, the name of the signal, the interface to which the signal belongs, and also the values of the signal's parameters (if any). The communication is one-way: there are no response messages to the original message from any client process, since the sender knows neither the identities nor the number of the recipients.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}}\n\nEvery D-Bus message consists of a header and a body.{{r|dbus tut}} The header is formed by several fields that identify the type of message, the sender, as well as information required to deliver the message to its recipient (destination bus name, object path, method or signal name, interface name, etc.).{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|dbus spec}} The body contains the data payload that the receiver process interprets &mdash;for instance the input or output arguments. All the data is encoded in a well known binary format called the ''wire format'' which supports the [[serialization]] of various types, such as integers and floating-point numbers, strings, compound types, and so on,{{r|dbus spec}} also referred to as  [[Marshalling (computer science)|marshaling]].\n\nThe D-Bus specification defines the [[wire protocol]]: how to build the D-Bus messages to be exchanged between processes within a D-Bus connection. However, it does not define the underlying transport method for delivering these messages.\n\n== Internals ==\nMost existing D-Bus implementations follow the architecture of the reference implementation. This architecture consists of two main components:{{r|intro dbus}}\n\n* a point-to-point communications [[Library (computing)|library]] that implements the D-Bus [[wire protocol]] in order to exchange messages between two processes. In the reference implementation this library is '''{{mono|libdbus}}'''. In other implementations {{mono|libdbus}} may be wrapped by another higher-level library, language binding, or entirely replaced by a different standalone implementation that serves the same purpose.{{r|what is dbus q1}} This library only supports one-to-one communications between two processes.{{r|dbus tut}}\n* [[File:Dbus-daemon.svg|thumb|A {{mono|dbus-daemon}} process acting as a D-Bus message bus daemon. Every process connected to the bus keeps one D-Bus connection with it.]]a special [[Daemon (computing)|daemon process]] that plays the bus role and to which the rest of the processes connect using any D-Bus point-to-point communications library. This process is also known as the ''message bus daemon'',{{r|Love 2005}} since it is responsible for routing messages from any process connected to the bus to another. In the reference implementation this role is performed by '''{{mono|dbus-daemon}}''', which itself is built on top of {{mono|libdbus}}. Another implementation of the message bus daemon is '''{{mono|dbus-broker}}''', which is built on top of '''{{mono|sd-bus}}'''.\n\n{{multiple image\n | footer = \n | image1 = D-Bus communications architecture - simple.svg\n | alt1 = Process A and B have a one-to-one D-Bus connection between them over a Unix domain socket\n | caption1 = Process A and B have a one-to-one D-Bus connection using {{mono|libdbus}} over a Unix domain socket.

They can exchange messages sending them to the message bus process, which in turn will deliver the messages to the appropriate process. In this scenario bus names are mandatory to identify the destination process.\n }}\nThe {{mono|libdbus}} library (or its equivalent) internally uses a native lower-level IPC mechanism to transport the required D-Bus messages between the two processes in both ends of the D-Bus connection. D-Bus specification doesn't mandate which particular IPC transport mechanisms should be available to use, as it's the communications library that decides what transport methods it supports. For instance, in Linux and Unix-like operating systems {{mono|libdbus}} typically uses [[Unix domain socket]]s as the underlying transport method, but it also supports [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP sockets]].{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}}\n\nThe communications libraries of both processes must agree on the selected transport method and also on the particular channel used for their communication. This information is defined by what D-Bus calls an ''address''.{{r|Cocagne 2012}}{{r|dbus tut}} Unix-domain socket are [[filesystem]] objects, and therefore they can be identified by a filename, so a valid address would be <code>unix:path=/tmp/.hiddensocket</code>.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus spec}} Both processes must pass the same address to their respective communications libraries to establish the D-Bus connection between them. An address can also provide additional data to the communications library in the form of comma-separated <code>key=value</code> pairs.{{r|Cocagne 2012}}{{r|dbus spec}} This way, for example, it can provide authentication information to a specific type of connection that supports it.\n\nWhen a message bus daemon like {{mono|dbus-daemon}} is used to implement a D-Bus bus, all processes that want to connect to the bus must know the ''bus address'', the address by which a process can establish a D-Bus connection to the central message bus process.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}} In this scenario, the message bus daemon selects the bus address and the remainder processes must pass that value to their corresponding {{mono|libdbus}} or equivalent libraries. {{mono|dbus-daemon}} defines a different bus address for every bus instance it provides. These addresses are defined in the daemon's configuration files.\n\nTwo processes can use a D-Bus connection to exchange messages directly between them{{r|what is dbus q2}}, but this is not the way in which D-Bus is normally intended to be used. The usual way is to always use a message bus daemon (i.e. {{mono|dbus-daemon}}) as a communications central point to which each process should establish its point-to-point D-Bus connection. When a process &mdash;client or service&mdash; sends a D-Bus message, the message bus process receives it in the first instance and delivers it to the appropriate recipient. The message bus daemon may be seen as a hub or router in charge of getting each message to its destination by repeating it through the D-Bus connection to the recipient process.{{r|dbus tut}} The recipient process is determined by the destination bus name in the message's header field,{{r|dbus spec}} or by the subscription information to signals maintained by the message bus daemon in the case of signal propagation messages.{{r|Cocagne 2012}} The message bus daemon can also produce its own messages as a response to certain conditions, such as an error message to a process that sent a message to a nonexistent bus name.{{r|dbus tut}}\n\n{{mono|dbus-daemon}} improves the feature set already provided by D-Bus itself with additional functionality. For example, ''service activation'' allows automatic starting of services when needed &mdash;when the first request to any bus name of such service arrives at the message bus daemon.{{r|intro dbus}} This way, service processes neither need to be launched during the [[init|system initialization]] or user initialization stage nor need they consume memory or other resources when not being used. This feature was originally implemented using [[setuid]] helpers,{{r|dbus service activation}} but nowadays it can also be provided by [[systemd]]'s service activation framework.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Service activation is an important feature that facilitates the management of the process lifecycle of services (for example when a desktop component should start or stop).{{r|dbus tut}}\n\n== History and adoption ==\nD-Bus was started in 2002 by Havoc Pennington, Alex Larsson ([[Red Hat]]) and Anders Carlsson.{{r|Palmieri 2005}} The version 1.0 &mdash;considered [[Application Program Interface|API]] stable&mdash; was released in November 2006.{{r|dbus 1.0}}{{r|Molkentin 2006}}\n\n[[File:Free and open-source-software display servers and UI toolkits.svg|thumb|right|350px|The {{Mono|dbus-daemon}} plays a significant role in modern Linux [[graphical desktop environment]]s.]]\nHeavily influenced by the [[DCOP]] system used by versions 2 and 3 of [[KDE]], D-Bus has replaced DCOP in the [[KDE 4]] release.{{r|Molkentin 2006}}{{r|KDE dbus intro}} An implementation of D-Bus supports most [[POSIX]] operating systems, and a port for [[Windows]] exists. It is used by [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] 4 and [[GNOME]]. In GNOME it has gradually replaced most parts of the earlier [[Bonobo (GNOME)|Bonobo]] mechanism. It is also used by [[Xfce]].\n\nOne of the earlier adopters was the (nowadays deprecated) [[HAL (software)|Hardware Abstraction Layer]]. HAL used D-Bus to export information about hardware that has been added to or removed from the computer.{{r|Palmieri 2005}}\n\nThe usage of D-Bus is steadily expanding beyond the initial scope of desktop environments to cover an increasing amount of system services. For instance, [[NetworkManager]] network daemon, [[BlueZ]] bluetooth stack and [[Pulseaudio]] sound server use D-Bus to provide part or all of its services. [[systemd]] uses the D-Bus wire protocol for communication between [[Systemd#Core_components_and_libraries|{{mono|systemctl}}]] and systemd, and is also promoting traditional system daemons to D-Bus services, such as [[logind]].{{r|Poettering 2015 q2}} Another heavy user of D-Bus is [[Polkit]], whose policy authority daemon is implemented as a service connected to the system bus.{{r|polkit doc}}\n\nIt is also used as the [[Wire protocol]] for the [[AllJoyn]] protocol for home automation, to this end AllJoyn adds discovery, session management, security, header compression, embedded device support and makes it transport agnostic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://allseenalliance.org/developer-resources/forum/developers/difference-d-bus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721005141/https://allseenalliance.org/developer-resources/forum/developers/difference-d-bus |archivedate=2015-07-21 }}</ref>\n\n== Implementations ==\n=== {{Anchor|LIBDBUS}} libdbus ===\nAlthough there are several implementations of D-Bus, the most widely used is the reference implementation ''libdbus'', developed by the same freedesktop.org project that designed the specification. However, libdbus is a low-level implementation that was never meant to be used directly by application developers, but as a reference guide for other reimplementations of D-Bus (such as those included in standard libraries of desktop environments, or in [[programming language]] bindings). The freedesktop.org project itself recommends applications authors to \"use one of the higher level bindings or implementations\" instead.{{r|what is dbus q3}} The predominance of libdbus as the most used D-Bus implementation caused the terms \"D-Bus\" and \"libdbus\" to be often used interchangeably, leading to confusion.\n\n=== GDBus ===\nGDBus{{r|gdbus}} is an implementation of D-Bus based on [[GIO (software)|GIO streams]] included in [[GLib]], aiming to be used by [[GTK+]] and [[GNOME]]. GDBus is not a wrapper of libdbus, but a complete and independent reimplementation of the D-Bus specification and protocol.{{r|gdbus2}} [[MATE (software)|MATE Desktop]]<ref>{{cite web |title=MATE: Roadmap |url=http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/roadmap |accessdate=31 January 2019}}</ref> and [[Xfce]] (version 4.14), which are also based on GTK+ 3, also use GDBus.\n\n=== QtDBus ===\nQtDBus{{r|qtdbus}} is an implementation of D-Bus included in the [[Qt (software)|Qt library]] since its version 4.2. This component is used by [[KDE]] applications, libraries and components to access the D-Bus services available in a system.\n\n=== sd-bus ===\nIn 2013, the [[systemd]] project rewrote libdbus in an effort to simplify the code,{{r|Poettering 2013}} but it also resulted in a significant increase of the overall D-Bus performance. In preliminary benchmarks, [[BMW]] found that the systemd's D-Bus library increased performance by 360%.{{r|Edge 2013}} By version 221 of [[systemd]], the sd-bus [[Application programming interface|API]] was declared stable.{{r|systemd 221}}\n\n=== libnih-dbus ===\nThe libnih project provides a light-weight \"standard library\" of C support for D-Bus.

The latter restriction may change in the future if all user sessions are combined into a single user bus.{{r|Poettering 2015 q1}}\n\nD-Bus provides additional or simplifies existing functionality to the applications, including information-sharing, modularity and [[privilege separation]]. For example, information on an incoming voice-call received through [[Bluetooth]] or [[Skype]] can be propagated and interpreted by any currently-running music player, which can react by muting the volume or by pausing playback until the call is finished.{{r|Love 2005}}\n\nD-Bus can also be used as a [[Software framework|framework]] to integrate different components of a user application. For instance, an [[office suite]] can communicate through the session bus to share data between a [[word processor]] and a [[spreadsheet]].\n\n== D-Bus specification ==\n\n=== Bus model ===\nEvery connection to a bus is identified in the context of D-Bus by what is called a ''bus name''.{{r|intro dbus}} A bus name consists of two or more dot-separated strings of letters, digits, dashes, and underscores. An example of a valid bus name is {{code|org.freedesktop.NetworkManager}}.{{r|Cocagne 2012}}\n\nWhen a process sets up a connection to a bus, the bus assigns to the connection a special bus name called ''unique connection name''.{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}} Bus names of this type are immutable&mdash;it's guaranteed they won't change as long as the connection exists&mdash;and, more importantly, they can't be reused during the bus lifetime.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}} This means that no other connection to that bus will ever have assigned such unique connection name, even if the same process closes down the connection to the bus and creates a new one. Unique connection names are easily recognizable because they start with the&mdash;otherwise forbidden&mdash;colon character.{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}} An example of a unique connection name is {{code|:1.1553}} (the characters after the colon have no particular meaning{{r|dbus tut}}).\n\nA process can ask for additional bus names for its connection,{{r|dbus tut}} provided that any requested name is not already being used by another connection to the bus. In D-Bus parlance, when a bus name is assigned to a connection, it is said the connection ''owns'' the bus name.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}} In that sense, a bus name can't be owned by two connections at the same time, but, unlike unique connection names, these names can be reused if they are available: a process may reclaim a bus name released &mdash;purposely or not&mdash; by another process.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}}\n\nThe idea behind these additional bus names, commonly called ''well-known names'', is to provide a way to refer to a service using a prearranged bus name.{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}} For instance, the service that reports the current time and date in the system bus lies in the process whose connection owns the {{mono|org.freedesktop.timedate1}} bus name, regardless of which process it is.\n\nBus names can be used as a simple way to implement single instance applications (second instances detect that the bus name is already taken).{{r|dbus tut}} It can also be used to track a service process lifecycle, since the bus sends a notification when a bus name is released due to a process termination.{{r|dbus tut}}\n\n=== Object model ===\nBecause of its original conception as a replacement for several component oriented communications systems, D-Bus shares with its predecessors an object model in which to express the semantics of the communications between clients and services. The terms used in the D-Bus object model mimic those used by some [[object oriented]] [[programming language]]s. That doesn't mean that D-Bus is somehow limited to OOP languages &mdash;in fact, the most used implementation ({{mono|libdbus}}) is written in [[C (programming language)|C]], a [[procedural programming]] language.\n\n[[File:D-Feet.png|thumb|Browsing the existing bus names, objects, interfaces, methods and signals in a D-Bus bus using D-Feet]]\nIn D-Bus, a process offers its services by exposing ''objects''. These objects have ''methods'' that can be invoked, and ''signals'' that the object can emit.{{r|dbus tut}} Methods and signals are collectively referred to as the ''members'' of the object.{{r|intro dbus}} Any client connected to the bus can interact with an object by using its methods, making requests or commanding the object to perform actions.{{r|dbus tut}} For instance, an object representing a time service can be queried by a client using a method that returns the current date and time. A client can also listen to signals that an object emits when its state changes due to certain events, usually related to the underlying service. An example would be when a service that manages hardware devices &mdash;such as USB or network drivers&mdash; signals a \"new hardware device added\" event. Clients should instruct the bus that they are interested in receiving certain signals from a particular object, since a D-Bus bus only passes signals to those processes with a registered interest in them.{{r|Cocagne 2012}}\n\nA process connected to a D-Bus bus can request it to ''export'' as many D-Bus objects as it wants. Each object is identified by an ''object path'', a string of numbers, letters and underscores separated and prefixed by the slash character, called that because of their resemblance to [[Unix path|Unix filesystem paths]].{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}} The object path is selected by the requesting process, and must be unique in the context of that bus connection. An example of a valid object path is {{code|/org/kde/kspread/sheets/3/cells/4/5}}.{{r|dbus tut}} However, it's not enforced &mdash;but also not discouraged&mdash; to form hierarchies within object paths.{{r|Cocagne 2012}} The particular naming convention for the objects of a service is entirely up to the developers of such service, but many developers choose to [[namespace]] them using the reserved [[domain name]] of the project as a prefix (e.g. {{mono|/org/kde}}).{{r|dbus tut}}\n\nEvery object is inextricably associated to the particular bus connection where it was exported, and, from the D-Bus point of view, only lives in the context of such connection. Therefore, in order to be able to use a certain service, a client must indicate not only the object path providing the desired service, but also the bus name under which the service process is connected to the bus.{{r|intro dbus}} This in turn allows that several processes connected to the bus can export different objects with identical object paths unambiguously.\n\nMembers &mdash;methods and signals&mdash; that can be used with an object are specified by an ''interface''.{{r|dbus tut}} An ''interface'' is a set of declarations of methods (including its passing and returning parameters) and signals (including its parameters) identified by a dot-separated name resembling the [[Java (programming language)|Java language]] interfaces notation.{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}} An example of a valid interface name is {{code|org.freedesktop.Introspectable}}.{{r|Cocagne 2012}} Despite their similarity, interface names and bus names should not be mistaken. A D-Bus object can ''implement'' several interfaces, but at least must implement one, providing support for every method and signal defined by it. The combination of all interfaces implemented by an object is called the object ''type''.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}}\n\nWhen using an object, it's a good practice for the client process to provide the member's interface name besides the member's name, but is only mandatory when there is an ambiguity caused by duplicated member names available from different interfaces implemented by the object{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}} &mdash;otherwise, the selected member is undefined or erroneous. An emitted signal, on the other hand, must always indicate to which interface it belongs.\n\nThe D-Bus specification also defines several standard interfaces that objects may want to implement in addition to its own interfaces.{{r|dbus spec}} Although technically optional, most D-Bus service developers choose to support them in their exported objects since they offer important additional features to D-Bus clients, such as [[Type introspection|introspection]].{{r|Cocagne 2012}} These standard interfaces are:{{r|dbus spec}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}}\n* {{mono|org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer}}: provides a way to test if a D-Bus connection is alive.{{r|Cocagne 2012}}\n* {{mono|org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable}}: provides an introspection mechanism by which a client process can, at run-time, get a description (in [[XML]] format) of the interfaces, methods and signals that the object implements.{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|dbus spec}}\n* {{mono|org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties}}: allows a D-Bus object to expose the underlying native object [[Property (programming)|properties]] or attributes, or simulate them if it doesn't exist.{{r|dbus spec}}\n* {{mono|org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager}}: when a D-Bus service arranges its objects hierarchically, this interface provides a way to query an object about all sub-objects under its path, as well as their interfaces and properties, using a single method call.{{r|dbus spec}}\n\nThe D-Bus specification defines a number of administrative bus operations (called \"bus services\") to be performed using the {{mono|/org/freedesktop/DBus}} object that resides in the {{mono|org.freedesktop.DBus}} bus name.{{r|dbus spec}} Each bus reserves this special bus name for itself, and manages any requests made specifically to this combination of bus name and object path. The administrative operations provided by the bus are those defined by the object's interface {{mono|org.freedesktop.DBus}}. These operations are used for example to provide information about the status of the bus,{{r|intro dbus}} or to manage the request and release of additional ''well-known'' bus names.{{r|dbus spec}}{{r|Cocagne 2012}}\n\n=== Communications model ===\nD-Bus was conceived as a generic, high-level inter-process communication system. To accomplish such goals, D-Bus communications are based on the exchange of ''messages'' between processes instead of \"raw bytes\".{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}} D-Bus messages are high-level discrete items that a process can send through the bus to another connected process. Messages have a well-defined structure (even the types of the data carried in their payload are defined), allowing the bus to validate them and to reject any ill-formed message.\nIn this regard, D-Bus is closer to an [[Remote procedure call|RPC]] mechanism than to a classic IPC mechanism, with its own type definition system and its own [[Marshalling (computer science)|marshaling]].{{r|intro dbus}}\n\n[[File:D-Bus method invocation.svg|thumb|Example of one-to-one request-response message exchange to invoke a method over D-Bus. Here the client process invokes the {{mono|SetFoo()}} method of the {{mono|/org/example/object1}} object from the service process named {{mono|org.example.foo}} (or {{code|:1.14}}) in the bus.]]\nThe bus supports two modes of interchanging messages between a client and a service process{{r|intro dbus}}:\n* One-to-one [[request-response]]: This is the way for a client to invoke an object's method. The client sends a message to the service process exporting the object, and the service in turn replies with a message back to the client process.{{r|dbus tut}} The message sent by the client must contain the object path, the name of the invoked method (and optionally the name of its interface), and the values of the input parameters (if any) as defined by the object's selected interface. The reply message carries the result of the request, including the values of the output parameters returned by the object's method invocation, or ''exception'' information if there was an error.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}}\n* [[Publish/subscribe]]: This is the way for an object to announce the occurrence of a signal to the interested parties. The object's service process broadcasts a message that the bus passes only to the connected clients subscribed to the object's signal.{{r|dbus tut}} The message carries the object path, the name of the signal, the interface to which the signal belongs, and also the values of the signal's parameters (if any). The communication is one-way: there are no response messages to the original message from any client process, since the sender knows neither the identities nor the number of the recipients.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}}\n\nEvery D-Bus message consists of a header and a body.{{r|dbus tut}} The header is formed by several fields that identify the type of message, the sender, as well as information required to deliver the message to its recipient (destination bus name, object path, method or signal name, interface name, etc.).{{r|dbus tut}}{{r|dbus spec}} The body contains the data payload that the receiver process interprets &mdash;for instance the input or output arguments. All the data is encoded in a well known binary format called the ''wire format'' which supports the [[serialization]] of various types, such as integers and floating-point numbers, strings, compound types, and so on,{{r|dbus spec}} also referred to as  [[Marshalling (computer science)|marshaling]].\n\nThe D-Bus specification defines the [[wire protocol]]: how to build the D-Bus messages to be exchanged between processes within a D-Bus connection. However, it does not define the underlying transport method for delivering these messages.\n\n== Internals ==\nMost existing D-Bus implementations follow the architecture of the reference implementation. This architecture consists of two main components:{{r|intro dbus}}\n\n* a point-to-point communications [[Library (computing)|library]] that implements the D-Bus [[wire protocol]] in order to exchange messages between two processes. In the reference implementation this library is '''{{mono|libdbus}}'''. In other implementations {{mono|libdbus}} may be wrapped by another higher-level library, language binding, or entirely replaced by a different standalone implementation that serves the same purpose.{{r|what is dbus q1}} This library only supports one-to-one communications between two processes.{{r|dbus tut}}\n* [[File:Dbus-daemon.svg|thumb|A {{mono|dbus-daemon}} process acting as a D-Bus message bus daemon. Every process connected to the bus keeps one D-Bus connection with it.]]a special [[Daemon (computing)|daemon process]] that plays the bus role and to which the rest of the processes connect using any D-Bus point-to-point communications library. This process is also known as the ''message bus daemon'',{{r|Love 2005}} since it is responsible for routing messages from any process connected to the bus to another. In the reference implementation this role is performed by '''{{mono|dbus-daemon}}''', which itself is built on top of {{mono|libdbus}}. Another implementation of the message bus daemon is '''{{mono|dbus-broker}}''', which is built on top of '''{{mono|sd-bus}}'''.\n\n{{multiple image\n | footer = \n | image1 = D-Bus communications architecture - simple.svg\n | alt1 = Process A and B have a one-to-one D-Bus connection between them over a Unix domain socket\n | caption1 = Process A and B have a one-to-one D-Bus connection using {{mono|libdbus}} over a Unix domain socket.

They can exchange messages sending them to the message bus process, which in turn will deliver the messages to the appropriate process. In this scenario bus names are mandatory to identify the destination process.\n }}\nThe {{mono|libdbus}} library (or its equivalent) internally uses a native lower-level IPC mechanism to transport the required D-Bus messages between the two processes in both ends of the D-Bus connection. D-Bus specification doesn't mandate which particular IPC transport mechanisms should be available to use, as it's the communications library that decides what transport methods it supports. For instance, in Linux and Unix-like operating systems {{mono|libdbus}} typically uses [[Unix domain socket]]s as the underlying transport method, but it also supports [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP sockets]].{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}}\n\nThe communications libraries of both processes must agree on the selected transport method and also on the particular channel used for their communication. This information is defined by what D-Bus calls an ''address''.{{r|Cocagne 2012}}{{r|dbus tut}} Unix-domain socket are [[filesystem]] objects, and therefore they can be identified by a filename, so a valid address would be <code>unix:path=/tmp/.hiddensocket</code>.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus spec}} Both processes must pass the same address to their respective communications libraries to establish the D-Bus connection between them. An address can also provide additional data to the communications library in the form of comma-separated <code>key=value</code> pairs.{{r|Cocagne 2012}}{{r|dbus spec}} This way, for example, it can provide authentication information to a specific type of connection that supports it.\n\nWhen a message bus daemon like {{mono|dbus-daemon}} is used to implement a D-Bus bus, all processes that want to connect to the bus must know the ''bus address'', the address by which a process can establish a D-Bus connection to the central message bus process.{{r|intro dbus}}{{r|dbus tut}} In this scenario, the message bus daemon selects the bus address and the remainder processes must pass that value to their corresponding {{mono|libdbus}} or equivalent libraries. {{mono|dbus-daemon}} defines a different bus address for every bus instance it provides. These addresses are defined in the daemon's configuration files.\n\nTwo processes can use a D-Bus connection to exchange messages directly between them{{r|what is dbus q2}}, but this is not the way in which D-Bus is normally intended to be used. The usual way is to always use a message bus daemon (i.e. {{mono|dbus-daemon}}) as a communications central point to which each process should establish its point-to-point D-Bus connection. When a process &mdash;client or service&mdash; sends a D-Bus message, the message bus process receives it in the first instance and delivers it to the appropriate recipient. The message bus daemon may be seen as a hub or router in charge of getting each message to its destination by repeating it through the D-Bus connection to the recipient process.{{r|dbus tut}} The recipient process is determined by the destination bus name in the message's header field,{{r|dbus spec}} or by the subscription information to signals maintained by the message bus daemon in the case of signal propagation messages.{{r|Cocagne 2012}} The message bus daemon can also produce its own messages as a response to certain conditions, such as an error message to a process that sent a message to a nonexistent bus name.{{r|dbus tut}}\n\n{{mono|dbus-daemon}} improves the feature set already provided by D-Bus itself with additional functionality. For example, ''service activation'' allows automatic starting of services when needed &mdash;when the first request to any bus name of such service arrives at the message bus daemon.{{r|intro dbus}} This way, service processes neither need to be launched during the [[init|system initialization]] or user initialization stage nor need they consume memory or other resources when not being used. This feature was originally implemented using [[setuid]] helpers,{{r|dbus service activation}} but nowadays it can also be provided by [[systemd]]'s service activation framework.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Service activation is an important feature that facilitates the management of the process lifecycle of services (for example when a desktop component should start or stop).{{r|dbus tut}}\n\n== History and adoption ==\nD-Bus was started in 2002 by Havoc Pennington, Alex Larsson ([[Red Hat]]) and Anders Carlsson.{{r|Palmieri 2005}} The version 1.0 &mdash;considered [[Application Program Interface|API]] stable&mdash; was released in November 2006.{{r|dbus 1.0}}{{r|Molkentin 2006}}\n\n[[File:Free and open-source-software display servers and UI toolkits.svg|thumb|right|350px|The {{Mono|dbus-daemon}} plays a significant role in modern Linux [[graphical desktop environment]]s.]]\nHeavily influenced by the [[DCOP]] system used by versions 2 and 3 of [[KDE]], D-Bus has replaced DCOP in the [[KDE 4]] release.{{r|Molkentin 2006}}{{r|KDE dbus intro}} An implementation of D-Bus supports most [[POSIX]] operating systems, and a port for [[Windows]] exists. It is used by [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] 4 and [[GNOME]]. In GNOME it has gradually replaced most parts of the earlier [[Bonobo (GNOME)|Bonobo]] mechanism. It is also used by [[Xfce]].\n\nOne of the earlier adopters was the (nowadays deprecated) [[HAL (software)|Hardware Abstraction Layer]]. HAL used D-Bus to export information about hardware that has been added to or removed from the computer.{{r|Palmieri 2005}}\n\nThe usage of D-Bus is steadily expanding beyond the initial scope of desktop environments to cover an increasing amount of system services. For instance, [[NetworkManager]] network daemon, [[BlueZ]] bluetooth stack and [[Pulseaudio]] sound server use D-Bus to provide part or all of its services. [[systemd]] uses the D-Bus wire protocol for communication between [[Systemd#Core_components_and_libraries|{{mono|systemctl}}]] and systemd, and is also promoting traditional system daemons to D-Bus services, such as [[logind]].{{r|Poettering 2015 q2}} Another heavy user of D-Bus is [[Polkit]], whose policy authority daemon is implemented as a service connected to the system bus.{{r|polkit doc}}\n\nIt is also used as the [[Wire protocol]] for the [[AllJoyn]] protocol for home automation, to this end AllJoyn adds discovery, session management, security, header compression, embedded device support and makes it transport agnostic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://allseenalliance.org/developer-resources/forum/developers/difference-d-bus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721005141/https://allseenalliance.org/developer-resources/forum/developers/difference-d-bus |archivedate=2015-07-21 }}</ref>\n\n== Implementations ==\n=== {{Anchor|LIBDBUS}} libdbus ===\nAlthough there are several implementations of D-Bus, the most widely used is the reference implementation ''libdbus'', developed by the same freedesktop.org project that designed the specification. However, libdbus is a low-level implementation that was never meant to be used directly by application developers, but as a reference guide for other reimplementations of D-Bus (such as those included in standard libraries of desktop environments, or in [[programming language]] bindings). The freedesktop.org project itself recommends applications authors to \"use one of the higher level bindings or implementations\" instead.{{r|what is dbus q3}} The predominance of libdbus as the most used D-Bus implementation caused the terms \"D-Bus\" and \"libdbus\" to be often used interchangeably, leading to confusion.\n\n=== GDBus ===\nGDBus{{r|gdbus}} is an implementation of D-Bus based on [[GIO (software)|GIO streams]] included in [[GLib]], aiming to be used by [[GTK+]] and [[GNOME]].

In preliminary benchmarks, [[BMW]] found that the systemd's D-Bus library increased performance by 360%.{{r|Edge 2013}} By version 221 of [[systemd]], the sd-bus [[Application programming interface|API]] was declared stable.{{r|systemd 221}}\n\n=== libnih-dbus ===\nThe libnih project provides a light-weight \"standard library\" of C support for D-Bus.
