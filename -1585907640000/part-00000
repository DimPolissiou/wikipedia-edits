It is a branch of the French Armed Forces placed under the jurisdiction of the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]]\u2014with additional duties to the Ministry of Defense. Its area of responsibility includes smaller towns, rural and suburban areas, while the {{lang|fr|[[National Police (France)|Police Nationale]]}}\u2014a civilian force\u2014is in charge of cities and downtowns. Due to its military status, the Gendarmerie also fulfills a range of military and defense missions. The Gendarmes also have a [[cybercrime]] division. It has a strength of more than 100,000 personnel as of 2014.<ref name=\"MemoGend\"/>\n\nThe Gendarmerie is heir to the {{lang|fr|Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e}} (Marshalcy\u2014see below), the oldest police force in France, dating back to the Middle Ages. It has influenced the culture and traditions of [[gendarmerie]] forces all around the world\u2014and especially in the former [[French colonial empire]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history of the institution===\n{{French military}}\nThe Gendarmerie is the direct descendant of the '''Marshalcy''' of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime in France|ancien regime]], more commonly known by its French title, the '''''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'''''.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], there were two [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|Grand Officers]] of the Kingdom of France with police responsibilities: The [[Marshal of France]] and the [[Constable of France]]. The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the ''Marshal's provost'', whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal. The Marshalcy dates back to the [[Hundred Years War]], and some historians trace it back to the early twelfth century.\n\nAnother organisation, the '''[[Constabulary]]''' (French: '''''Conn\u00e9tablie'''''), was under the command of the [[Constable of France]]. The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337.\n\nIn 1415 the Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e fought in the [[Battle of Agincourt]] and their commander, the \"Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t des Mar\u00e9chaux\" (Provost of the Marshals), Gallois de Fougi\u00e8res, was killed in battle. His existence was rediscovered in 1934. Gallois de Fougi\u00e8res was then officially recorded as the first known gendarme to have died in the line of duty and his remains are now buried under the monument to the gendarmerie in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].\n\nUnder King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] ({{r.|1515|1547}}), the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' was merged with the [[Constabulary]]. The resulting force was also known as the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'', or, formally, the '''Constabulary and Marshalcy of France''' (French: '''''conn\u00e9tablie et mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e de France'''''). Unlike the former constabulary the new ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' was not a fully militarized force.\n\n[[File:Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e 1786.png|thumb]]\nIn 1720, the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' was officially attached to the Household of the King (''Maison du Roi''), together with the \"gendarmerie\" of the time, which was not a police force at all, but a royal bodyguard. During the eighteenth century, the marshalcy developed in two distinct areas: increasing numbers of '''Marshalcy Companies''' ('''''compagnies de marechauss\u00e9e'''''), dispersed into small detachments, were stationed around the French countryside providing law and order, while specialist units provided security for royal and strategic sites such as palaces and the mint (e.g. the ''garde de la pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'h\u00f4tel du roi'' and the ''pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 des monnaies de Paris''.)\n\nWhile its existence ensured the relative safety of French rural districts and roads, the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e''  was regarded in contemporary England, which had no effective police force of any nature, as a symbol of foreign tyranny.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} English visitors to France saw their armed and uniformed patrols as royal soldiers with an oppressive role.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 1789, on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' numbered 3,660 men divided into small brigades (a \"brigade\" in this context being a squad of ten to twenty men). Their limited numbers and scattered deployment rendered the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' ineffective in controlling the \"[[Great Fear]]\" of July-August 1789.<ref>{{cite book|first=Howard G.|last=Brown|pages=189-190|title=Ending the French Revolution|ISBN=978-0-8139-2729-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Schama|page=430|title=Citizens. A Chronicle of the French Revolution|ISBN=0-670-81012-6}}</ref>\n\n===The Revolution===\nDuring the revolutionary period, the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' commanders generally placed themselves under the local constitutional authorities. Despite their connection with the king, they were therefore perceived as a force favouring the reforms of the [[French National Assembly]].\n\nAs a result, the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e Royale'' was not disbanded but simply renamed as the ''gendarmerie nationale'' (Law of 16 February 1791). Its personnel remained unchanged, and the functions of the force remained much as before. However, from this point, the gendarmerie, unlike the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' became a fully military force. During the revolutionary period, the main force responsible for policing was the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]]. Although the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' had been the main police force of the ''ancien regime'', the gendarmerie was initially a full-time auxiliary to the National Guard militia.\n\nIn 1791 the newly named ''gendarmerie nationale'' was grouped into 28 divisions, each commanded by a colonel responsible for three [[Departments of France|d\u00e9partements]]. In turn, two companies of gendarmes under the command of captains were based in each department. This territorial basis of organisation continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n===Nineteenth century===\n[[File:Napoleon Elite Gendarme by Bellange.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Gendarme d'\u00e9lite de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale]]]]\nUnder Napol\u00e9on, the numbers and responsibilities of the gendarmerie, renamed '''gendarmerie imp\u00e9riale''', were significantly expanded. In contrast to the mounted ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'', the gendarmerie comprised both horse and foot personnel; in 1800 these numbered approximately 10,500 of the former and 4,500, respectively.\n\nIn 1804 the first Inspector General of Gendarmerie was appointed and a general staff established\u2014based in the ''rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor\u00e9'' in Paris. Subsequently, special gendarmerie units were created within the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and for combat duties in French occupied Spain.\n\nFollowing the [[Second Restoration]] of 1815, the gendarmerie was reduced in numbers to about 18,000 and reorganised into departmental legions. Under King [[Louis Phillippe]] a \"gendarmerie of Africa\" was created for service in Algeria and during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] the Imperial Guard Gendarmerie Regiment was re-established. The majority of gendarmes continued in what was now the established role of the corps\u2014serving in small sedentary detachments as armed rural police. Under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] the ratio of foot to mounted gendarmes was increased and the numbers directly incorporated in the French Army with a [[military police]] role reduced.<ref>Edouard Detaille, pages 281-293, \"L'Armee Francaise\", {{ISBN|0-9632558-0-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, the [[\u00c9cole des officiers de la gendarmerie nationale]] was established to train its officers.\n\n===Battle honours===\nFive battles are registered on the flag of the Gendarmerie:\n* '''[[Battle of Hondschoote]]''' (1793): Four hundred gendarmes of the 32nd ''Division'' (equivalent of a regiment under the Revolution) engaged in battle on the left wing of the army. They seized enemy artillery positions and lost 117 men.\n* '''[[Villodrigo]]''' (1812): The 1st legion of Gendarmerie on horseback, belonging to the Brigade of Cavalry of the Army of the North, clashed with the British cavalry on 23 October 1812. Charging with sabres, they penetrated enemy lines, killing 250 and taking 85 prisoners. Colonel B\u00e9teille, commanding the brigade, received twelve sabre cuts, but he survived.\n* '''[[Battle of the Smala|Taguin]]''' (1843): Thirty gendarmes on horseback were mobilised to take part in tracking the tribe of the emir [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd-El-Kader]] and participated in his capture. In a painting by [[Horace Vernet]], which immortalises the scene (and hangs in the [[Mus\u00e9e de Versailles]]), the gendarmes appear alongside the Algerian Governor-General, [[Henri d'Orl\u00e9ans, duc d'Aumale]].\n* '''[[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Sevastopol]]''' (1855): Two infantry battalions of the Regiment of Gendarmerie of the Imperial Guard participated in taking [[Sevastopol|the city]]. The 1st battalion seized a strategic position that contributed towards the final victory. A total of 153 Gendarmes fell.\n* '''[[First Indochina War|Indo-China]]''' (1945/1954): Three legions of infantrymen from the [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guard]] were formed at the end of 1946. Charged with the formation of the Cochin China Civil Guard, they assumed security roles and patrolled the borders, suffering heavy losses: 654 killed or missing, and 1,500 wounded.\n\nThe gendarmerie is still sometimes referred to as the ''mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' (the old name for the service). The gendarmes are also occasionally called ''pandores'', which is a slang term derived from an 18th-century Hungarian word for frontier guards. The symbol of the gendarmerie is a stylized [[grenade]], which is also worn by the Italian [[Carabinieri]] and the [[Grenadier Guards]] in Britain. The budget in 2008 was approximately 7.7 billion [[euro]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.senat.fr/rap/a07-094-8/a07-094-80.html |title=2008 Budget Bill, French Senate |publisher=Senat.fr |date=2010-12-21 |accessdate=2017-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606123845/http://www.senat.fr/rap/a07-094-8/a07-094-80.html |archive-date=2017-06-06 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Missions==\n[[File:French Republican Guard Bastille Day 2007 n2.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[French Republican Guard]] is part of the National Gendarmerie and provides security as guards of honour during official ceremonies.]]\n\nIn French, the term \"police\" not only refers to the forces, but also to the general concept of \"maintenance of law and order\" (policing). The Gendarmerie's missions belong to three categories:\n* Administrative police (''police administrative''), upholding public order, safety checks and traffic controls, assistance to people in imminent danger, protection duties, etc.\n* Judicial police (''police judiciaire''), handling penal law enforcement and investigation of crimes and felonies\n* Military and defense missions, including military police for the armed forces\n\nThese missions include:\n\n* The policing of the countryside, rivers, coastal areas, and small towns with populations under 20,000, that are outside of the jurisdiction of the [[French National Police]].

The Departmental Gendarmerie carries out the general public order duties in municipalities with a population of up to 20 000 citizens.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/essonne-91/comment-sont-definies-les-zones-police-et-gendarmerie-07-07-2012-2080415.php |title = Comment sont d\u00e9finies les zones police et gendarmerie - Le Parisien |website = Leparisien.fr |access-date = 2017-09-07 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908020624/http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/essonne-91/comment-sont-definies-les-zones-police-et-gendarmerie-07-07-2012-2080415.php |archive-date=2017-09-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> When that limit is exceeded, the jurisdiction over the municipality is turned over to the National Police.\n\nIt is divided into 13 metropolitan [[Regions of France|regions]]{{NoteTag|Since 2016, metropolitan France has been divided into 12 administrative regions.}} (including Corsica), themselves divided into ''groupements'' (one for each of the 100 [[Departments of France|''d\u00e9partement'']], thus the name), themselves divided into ''compagnies'' (one for each of the 342 [[arrondissement in France|arrondissements]]).\n\nIt maintains gendarmerie brigades throughout the rural parts of the territory. There are two kind of brigades:\n* Large autonomous territorial brigades (BTAs)\n* Brigade groups composed of smaller brigades supervised by a larger one (COBs).\nIn addition, it has specialised units:\n* Research units, who conduct criminal investigations when their difficulty exceeds the abilities of the territorial units\n* Surveillance and intervention platoons (PSIGs), who conduct roving patrols and reinforce local units as needed.\n* Specialized brigades for prevention of [[juvenile delinquency]]\n* [[Highway patrol]] units.\n* Mountain units, specialised in surveillance and [[search and rescue]] operations, as well as inquiries in mountainous areas\n\nIn addition, the Gendarmerie runs a national criminal police institute (''Institut de recherche criminelle de la gendarmerie nationale'') specializing in supporting local units for difficult investigations.\n\nThe research units may be called into action by the judiciary even within cities (i.e. in the National Police's area of responsibility). As an example, the Paris research section of the Gendarmerie was in charge of the investigations into the vote-rigging allegations in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th district of Paris]] (see [[corruption scandals in the Paris region]]).\n\nGendarmes normally operate in uniform. They may operate in plainclothes only for specific missions and with their supervisors' authorisation.\n\n==== Mobile Gendarmerie ====\n{{Main|Mobile Gendarmerie}}\n[[File:Strasbourg 6 f\u00e9vrier 2013 manifestation sid\u00e9rurgistes ArcelorMittal 16.JPG|thumb|Mobile gendarmes during a demonstration]]\n\nThe [[Mobile Gendarmerie]], or ''Gendarmerie Mobile'', also named \u00ab La Jaune \u00bb ''(The Yellow)'', is currently divided into 7 Defense zones (''Zones de D\u00e9fense'').

The equivalent US unit would be a troop or a company.}} for a total of approx. 12,000 men and women.<ref name=\"MemoGend\" />\n\nIts main responsibilities are:\n* crowd and riot control\n* general security in support of the Departmental Gendarmerie\n* military and defense missions \n* missions that require large amounts of personnel ([[Vigipirate]] counter-terrorism patrols, searches in the countryside...)\n\nNearly 20% of the Mobile Gendarmerie squadrons are permanently deployed on a rotational basis in the French overseas territories. Other units deploy occasionally abroad alongside French troops engaged in military operations (called external operations or OPEX).\n\n[[File:GBGM5F Domenjod 160316.jpg|thumb|GBGM riot control training]]\n\nThe civilian tasks of the ''gendarmes mobiles'' are similar to those of the police units known as ''[[Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9]]'' (CRS), for which they are often mistaken. Easy ways to distinguish them include:\n* the uniform of the CRS is dark blue, the ''gendarmes mobiles'' are clad in black jackets and dark blue trousers;\n* the CRS wear a big red CRS patch; the gendarmes have stylised [[grenade]]s.\n* the helmet of the ''gendarmes mobiles'' is blue. The CRS helmet is black with two yellow stripes\n\nThe Mobile Gendarmerie includes GBGM (''Groupement Blind\u00e9 de la Gendarmerie Nationale''), an [[armoured warfare|Armoured]] grouping composed of seven squadrons equipped with [[VXB]] [[armored personnel carrier|armoured personnel carriers]], better known in the Gendarmerie as [[Berliet VXB-170|VBRG]] (''V\u00e9hicule Blind\u00e9 \u00e0 Roues de la Gendarmerie'', \"Gendarmerie armoured wheeled vehicle\").

Throughout most of the 19th century a wide [[bicorne]] was worn with a dark blue coat or tunic. Trousers were light blue. White [[aiguillettes]] were a distinguishing feature. In 1905 the bicorne was replaced by a dark blue [[kepi]] with white braiding, which had increasingly been worn as a service headdress. A silver crested helmet with plume, modelled on that of the French [[cuirassiers]], was adopted as a parade headdress until 1914. Following World War I a relatively simple uniform was adopted for the Gendarmerie, although traditional features such as the multiple-cord aiguillette and the dark blue/light blue colour combination were retained.\n\nSince 2006 a more casual \"relaxed uniform\" has been authorised for ordinary duties (see photograph below). The kepi however continues in use for dress occasions. Special items of clothing and equipment are issued for the various functions required of the Gendarmerie. The cavalry and infantry of the Republican Guard retain historic ceremonial uniforms dating from the 19th century.\n  \n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"140\">\nImage:Renault M\u00e9gane IV

Its area of responsibility includes smaller towns, rural and suburban areas, while the {{lang|fr|[[National Police (France)|Police Nationale]]}}\u2014a civilian force\u2014is in charge of cities and downtowns. Due to its military status, the Gendarmerie also fulfills a range of military and defense missions. The Gendarmes also have a [[cybercrime]] division. It has a strength of more than 100,000 personnel as of 2014.<ref name=\"MemoGend\"/>\n\nThe Gendarmerie is heir to the {{lang|fr|Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e}} (Marshalcy\u2014see below), the oldest police force in France, dating back to the Middle Ages. It has influenced the culture and traditions of [[gendarmerie]] forces all around the world\u2014and especially in the former [[French colonial empire]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history of the institution===\n{{French military}}\nThe Gendarmerie is the direct descendant of the '''Marshalcy''' of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime in France|ancien regime]], more commonly known by its French title, the '''''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'''''.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], there were two [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|Grand Officers]] of the Kingdom of France with police responsibilities: The [[Marshal of France]] and the [[Constable of France]]. The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the ''Marshal's provost'', whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal. The Marshalcy dates back to the [[Hundred Years War]], and some historians trace it back to the early twelfth century.\n\nAnother organisation, the '''[[Constabulary]]''' (French: '''''Conn\u00e9tablie'''''), was under the command of the [[Constable of France]]. The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337.\n\nIn 1415 the Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e fought in the [[Battle of Agincourt]] and their commander, the \"Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t des Mar\u00e9chaux\" (Provost of the Marshals), Gallois de Fougi\u00e8res, was killed in battle. His existence was rediscovered in 1934. Gallois de Fougi\u00e8res was then officially recorded as the first known gendarme to have died in the line of duty and his remains are now buried under the monument to the gendarmerie in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].\n\nUnder King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] ({{r.|1515|1547}}), the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' was merged with the [[Constabulary]]. The resulting force was also known as the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'', or, formally, the '''Constabulary and Marshalcy of France''' (French: '''''conn\u00e9tablie et mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e de France'''''). Unlike the former constabulary the new ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' was not a fully militarized force.\n\n[[File:Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e 1786.png|thumb]]\nIn 1720, the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' was officially attached to the Household of the King (''Maison du Roi''), together with the \"gendarmerie\" of the time, which was not a police force at all, but a royal bodyguard. During the eighteenth century, the marshalcy developed in two distinct areas: increasing numbers of '''Marshalcy Companies''' ('''''compagnies de marechauss\u00e9e'''''), dispersed into small detachments, were stationed around the French countryside providing law and order, while specialist units provided security for royal and strategic sites such as palaces and the mint (e.g. the ''garde de la pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'h\u00f4tel du roi'' and the ''pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 des monnaies de Paris''.)\n\nWhile its existence ensured the relative safety of French rural districts and roads, the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e''  was regarded in contemporary England, which had no effective police force of any nature, as a symbol of foreign tyranny.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} English visitors to France saw their armed and uniformed patrols as royal soldiers with an oppressive role.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 1789, on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' numbered 3,660 men divided into small brigades (a \"brigade\" in this context being a squad of ten to twenty men). Their limited numbers and scattered deployment rendered the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' ineffective in controlling the \"[[Great Fear]]\" of July-August 1789.<ref>{{cite book|first=Howard G.|last=Brown|pages=189-190|title=Ending the French Revolution|ISBN=978-0-8139-2729-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Schama|page=430|title=Citizens. A Chronicle of the French Revolution|ISBN=0-670-81012-6}}</ref>\n\n===The Revolution===\nDuring the revolutionary period, the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' commanders generally placed themselves under the local constitutional authorities. Despite their connection with the king, they were therefore perceived as a force favouring the reforms of the [[French National Assembly]].\n\nAs a result, the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e Royale'' was not disbanded but simply renamed as the ''gendarmerie nationale'' (Law of 16 February 1791). Its personnel remained unchanged, and the functions of the force remained much as before. However, from this point, the gendarmerie, unlike the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' became a fully military force. During the revolutionary period, the main force responsible for policing was the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]]. Although the ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' had been the main police force of the ''ancien regime'', the gendarmerie was initially a full-time auxiliary to the National Guard militia.\n\nIn 1791 the newly named ''gendarmerie nationale'' was grouped into 28 divisions, each commanded by a colonel responsible for three [[Departments of France|d\u00e9partements]]. In turn, two companies of gendarmes under the command of captains were based in each department. This territorial basis of organisation continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n===Nineteenth century===\n[[File:Napoleon Elite Gendarme by Bellange.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Gendarme d'\u00e9lite de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale]]]]\nUnder Napol\u00e9on, the numbers and responsibilities of the gendarmerie, renamed '''gendarmerie imp\u00e9riale''', were significantly expanded. In contrast to the mounted ''Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'', the gendarmerie comprised both horse and foot personnel; in 1800 these numbered approximately 10,500 of the former and 4,500, respectively.\n\nIn 1804 the first Inspector General of Gendarmerie was appointed and a general staff established\u2014based in the ''rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor\u00e9'' in Paris. Subsequently, special gendarmerie units were created within the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and for combat duties in French occupied Spain.\n\nFollowing the [[Second Restoration]] of 1815, the gendarmerie was reduced in numbers to about 18,000 and reorganised into departmental legions. Under King [[Louis Phillippe]] a \"gendarmerie of Africa\" was created for service in Algeria and during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] the Imperial Guard Gendarmerie Regiment was re-established. The majority of gendarmes continued in what was now the established role of the corps\u2014serving in small sedentary detachments as armed rural police. Under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] the ratio of foot to mounted gendarmes was increased and the numbers directly incorporated in the French Army with a [[military police]] role reduced.<ref>Edouard Detaille, pages 281-293, \"L'Armee Francaise\", {{ISBN|0-9632558-0-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, the [[\u00c9cole des officiers de la gendarmerie nationale]] was established to train its officers.\n\n===Battle honours===\nFive battles are registered on the flag of the Gendarmerie:\n* '''[[Battle of Hondschoote]]''' (1793): Four hundred gendarmes of the 32nd ''Division'' (equivalent of a regiment under the Revolution) engaged in battle on the left wing of the army. They seized enemy artillery positions and lost 117 men.\n* '''[[Villodrigo]]''' (1812): The 1st legion of Gendarmerie on horseback, belonging to the Brigade of Cavalry of the Army of the North, clashed with the British cavalry on 23 October 1812. Charging with sabres, they penetrated enemy lines, killing 250 and taking 85 prisoners. Colonel B\u00e9teille, commanding the brigade, received twelve sabre cuts, but he survived.\n* '''[[Battle of the Smala|Taguin]]''' (1843): Thirty gendarmes on horseback were mobilised to take part in tracking the tribe of the emir [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd-El-Kader]] and participated in his capture. In a painting by [[Horace Vernet]], which immortalises the scene (and hangs in the [[Mus\u00e9e de Versailles]]), the gendarmes appear alongside the Algerian Governor-General, [[Henri d'Orl\u00e9ans, duc d'Aumale]].\n* '''[[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Sevastopol]]''' (1855): Two infantry battalions of the Regiment of Gendarmerie of the Imperial Guard participated in taking [[Sevastopol|the city]]. The 1st battalion seized a strategic position that contributed towards the final victory. A total of 153 Gendarmes fell.\n* '''[[First Indochina War|Indo-China]]''' (1945/1954): Three legions of infantrymen from the [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guard]] were formed at the end of 1946. Charged with the formation of the Cochin China Civil Guard, they assumed security roles and patrolled the borders, suffering heavy losses: 654 killed or missing, and 1,500 wounded.\n\nThe gendarmerie is still sometimes referred to as the ''mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e'' (the old name for the service). The gendarmes are also occasionally called ''pandores'', which is a slang term derived from an 18th-century Hungarian word for frontier guards. The symbol of the gendarmerie is a stylized [[grenade]], which is also worn by the Italian [[Carabinieri]] and the [[Grenadier Guards]] in Britain. The budget in 2008 was approximately 7.7 billion [[euro]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.senat.fr/rap/a07-094-8/a07-094-80.html |title=2008 Budget Bill, French Senate |publisher=Senat.fr |date=2010-12-21 |accessdate=2017-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606123845/http://www.senat.fr/rap/a07-094-8/a07-094-80.html |archive-date=2017-06-06 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Missions==\n[[File:French Republican Guard Bastille Day 2007 n2.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[French Republican Guard]] is part of the National Gendarmerie and provides security as guards of honour during official ceremonies.]]\n\nIn French, the term \"police\" not only refers to the forces, but also to the general concept of \"maintenance of law and order\" (policing). The Gendarmerie's missions belong to three categories:\n* Administrative police (''police administrative''), upholding public order, safety checks and traffic controls, assistance to people in imminent danger, protection duties, etc.\n* Judicial police (''police judiciaire''), handling penal law enforcement and investigation of crimes and felonies\n* Military and defense missions, including military police for the armed forces\n\nThese missions include:\n\n* The policing of the countryside, rivers, coastal areas, and small towns with populations under 20,000, that are outside of the jurisdiction of the [[French National Police]].

The Departmental Gendarmerie carries out the general public order duties in municipalities with a population of up to 20 000 citizens.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/essonne-91/comment-sont-definies-les-zones-police-et-gendarmerie-07-07-2012-2080415.php |title = Comment sont d\u00e9finies les zones police et gendarmerie - Le Parisien |website = Leparisien.fr |access-date = 2017-09-07 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908020624/http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/essonne-91/comment-sont-definies-les-zones-police-et-gendarmerie-07-07-2012-2080415.php |archive-date=2017-09-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> When that limit is exceeded, the jurisdiction over the municipality is turned over to the National Police.\n\nIt is divided into 13 metropolitan [[Regions of France|regions]]{{NoteTag|Since 2016, metropolitan France has been divided into 12 administrative regions.}} (including Corsica), themselves divided into ''groupements'' (one for each of the 100 [[Departments of France|''d\u00e9partement'']], thus the name), themselves divided into ''compagnies'' (one for each of the 342 [[arrondissement in France|arrondissements]]).\n\nIt maintains gendarmerie brigades throughout the rural parts of the territory. There are two kind of brigades:\n* Large autonomous territorial brigades (BTAs)\n* Brigade groups composed of smaller brigades supervised by a larger one (COBs).\nIn addition, it has specialised units:\n* Research units, who conduct criminal investigations when their difficulty exceeds the abilities of the territorial units\n* Surveillance and intervention platoons (PSIGs), who conduct roving patrols and reinforce local units as needed.\n* Specialized brigades for prevention of [[juvenile delinquency]]\n* [[Highway patrol]] units.\n* Mountain units, specialised in surveillance and [[search and rescue]] operations, as well as inquiries in mountainous areas\n\nIn addition, the Gendarmerie runs a national criminal police institute (''Institut de recherche criminelle de la gendarmerie nationale'') specializing in supporting local units for difficult investigations.\n\nThe research units may be called into action by the judiciary even within cities (i.e. in the National Police's area of responsibility). As an example, the Paris research section of the Gendarmerie was in charge of the investigations into the vote-rigging allegations in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th district of Paris]] (see [[corruption scandals in the Paris region]]).\n\nGendarmes normally operate in uniform. They may operate in plainclothes only for specific missions and with their supervisors' authorisation.\n\n==== Mobile Gendarmerie ====\n{{Main|Mobile Gendarmerie}}\n[[File:Strasbourg 6 f\u00e9vrier 2013 manifestation sid\u00e9rurgistes ArcelorMittal 16.JPG|thumb|Mobile gendarmes during a demonstration]]\n\nThe [[Mobile Gendarmerie]], or ''Gendarmerie Mobile'', also named \u00ab La Jaune \u00bb ''(The Yellow)'', is currently divided into 7 Defense zones (''Zones de D\u00e9fense'').

The equivalent US unit would be a troop or a company.}} for a total of approx. 12,000 men and women.<ref name=\"MemoGend\" />\n\nIts main responsibilities are:\n* crowd and riot control\n* general security in support of the Departmental Gendarmerie\n* military and defense missions \n* missions that require large amounts of personnel ([[Vigipirate]] counter-terrorism patrols, searches in the countryside...)\n\nNearly 20% of the Mobile Gendarmerie squadrons are permanently deployed on a rotational basis in the French overseas territories. Other units deploy occasionally abroad alongside French troops engaged in military operations (called external operations or OPEX).\n\n[[File:GBGM5F Domenjod 160316.jpg|thumb|GBGM riot control training]]\n\nThe civilian tasks of the ''gendarmes mobiles'' are similar to those of the police units known as ''[[Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9]]'' (CRS), for which they are often mistaken. Easy ways to distinguish them include:\n* the uniform of the CRS is dark blue, the ''gendarmes mobiles'' are clad in black jackets and dark blue trousers;\n* the CRS wear a big red CRS patch; the gendarmes have stylised [[grenade]]s.\n* the helmet of the ''gendarmes mobiles'' is blue. The CRS helmet is black with two yellow stripes\n\nThe Mobile Gendarmerie includes GBGM (''Groupement Blind\u00e9 de la Gendarmerie Nationale''), an [[armoured warfare|Armoured]] grouping composed of seven squadrons equipped with [[VXB]] [[armored personnel carrier|armoured personnel carriers]], better known in the Gendarmerie as [[Berliet VXB-170|VBRG]] (''V\u00e9hicule Blind\u00e9 \u00e0 Roues de la Gendarmerie'', \"Gendarmerie armoured wheeled vehicle\").

Throughout most of the 19th century a wide [[bicorne]] was worn with a dark blue coat or tunic. Trousers were light blue. White [[aiguillettes]] were a distinguishing feature. In 1905 the bicorne was replaced by a dark blue [[kepi]] with white braiding, which had increasingly been worn as a service headdress. A silver crested helmet with plume, modelled on that of the French [[cuirassiers]], was adopted as a parade headdress until 1914. Following World War I a relatively simple uniform was adopted for the Gendarmerie, although traditional features such as the multiple-cord aiguillette and the dark blue/light blue colour combination were retained.\n\nSince 2006 a more casual \"relaxed uniform\" has been authorised for ordinary duties (see photograph below). The kepi however continues in use for dress occasions. Special items of clothing and equipment are issued for the various functions required of the Gendarmerie. The cavalry and infantry of the Republican Guard retain historic ceremonial uniforms dating from the 19th century.\n  \n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"140\">\nImage:Renault M\u00e9gane IV

It is based on [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|Directive 2004/38/EC]].  It allows EEA citizens and their family members to live and work in the UK without explicit permission.  Although Swiss citizens are covered by a separate [[Switzerland and the European Union|bilateral agreement]] they are treated basically the same as EEA nationals.  Family members may need a special entry clearance (the [[European Economic Area Family Permit|EEA family permit]]) to enter the UK.\n\n==Legal context==\nThe basis of the Immigration EEA Regulations 2006 is Directive 2004/38/EC.  Member states are bound by the [[Treaty establishing the European Community|EC treaties]] to implement [[Directive (European Union)|Directives]] into national law.

A person outside of this definition (especially unmarried partners) may fall under the category extended family member.  These include dependents of the EU citizens, members of the household, and a partner in a \"durable relationship\".  While the Directive 2004/38 requires member states to \"facilitate entry\" for extended family members, the details are not defined.  The Directive does not seem to grant any rights to extended family members.\n\nIn the EEA Regulations, the acceptance of extended family members is not explicit. UK regulations have specific criteria for extended family members, including unmarried and same sex partners. Once an extended family member has been issued with an EEA family permit, Residence Card or Residence Certificate, they are regarded under UK regulations as family members.\n\n==Accession states==\n\nWorkers from recent member states have the right to move to the UK, but their access to the labour market is limited.  The details are defined in the [[Worker Registration Scheme]] (WRS).  Nationals of [[A8 countries]] will cease to be subject to the Worker Registration scheme and may benefit from free movement under the directive once 12 months employment with a single employer has been completed.  The transitional WRS scheme [[Freedom of movement for workers#Free movement rights of nationals of new member states|became obsolete in 2011]] when A8 national workers will have the same rights as all other EEA nationals.\n\n==Completeness==\n\nThe implementation is reasonably complete, although there are areas where the Directive has not been fully implemented. One example is a failure to correctly implement the [[Surinder Singh route|Surinder Singh]] ruling of the European Court of Justice.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yeo|first1=Colin|title=EU to investigate UK interpretation of Surinder Singh|url=https://www.freemovement.org.uk/eu-to-investigate-uk-interpretation-of-surinder-singh/|website=Free Movement: updates and commentary on immigration and asylum law|accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnother issue with the UK implementation of the Directive is that the UK has kept national immigration law (the \"Immigration Rules\") separate from the implementation of the European law (the \"EEA Regulations\").  While it is possible to switch from the UK law to the European law, this does reset the clock for acquiring permanent residence.  The legal situation of extended family members during this switch is uncertain, because they have to conform to both laws.  Switching from European law to UK law is possible only after the EEA citizen became settled in the UK. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The EEA national is considered settled when having attained permanent residence.\n\n==Implementation issues==\n{{Multiple issues|section = y|\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2009}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=November 2009}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=November 2009}}\n}}\n\nBy far the biggest implementation issue is the long processing time for the issue of residence cards (EEA2 applications).  This can take 6 months or longer (current processing times as at January 2009 are up to a year according to the [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/eucitizens/applyingundereuropeanlaw/ web site]).  During this time it is very difficult for the family member to start working, to open a bank account, to register with a doctor or to travel.  This issue is created and aggravated by a combination of several seemingly harmless infringements.  These infringements are:\n\n* The initial visa (EEA family permit) is valid for only 6 months (reduced in 2006 from previously 12 months).\n* The processing of the EEA2 application (which is required to be completed within 6 months) often takes longer than 6 months.\n* During this time the passport of both the EEA citizen and the family member is held by the Home Office.\n* While it is possible to request the passport back without cancelling the application, the [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/contact/contactspage/contactcentres/ current web page] does not mention this (unlike the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070702084524/http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/applying/returnofpassports previous one]).\n\nAnd without the passport life can be difficult for a foreigner, because the passport is required in many situations.  Even if the passport is received back, family members often encounter difficulties because of the short validity of the EEA family permit.  For example, a GP may refuse to register the family member because the visa is not valid for another 6 months (which is not correct, but nevertheless common).\n\nMost of these problems are aggravated by the way that the certificate of application (the acknowledgment of the application) is issued.\n\n* The certificate of application (which is required to be issued immediately) is sent very slowly.\n* The certificate of application is a generic letter without reference to the concrete case.\n* The certificate of application does not grant the right to enter the UK.\n\nThe obvious solution would be issue a temporary visa with the right to work immediately, and to send the residence card once the application is completed.  A self-help option is to keep the passports and only include a copy in the application.  According to individual reports the Home Office will request the passport once the application is ready for processing, and then the residence card is issued reasonably quickly.\n\nThere are further issues, but they have a comparatively small effect.  The application forms (EEA1, EEA2, EEA3, EEA4, and VAF5) are overly complicated, ask for a good amount of unnecessary information, and ask for many more documents to be included than legally necessary under the directive.  For example, the application for a residence card as the family member of an EEA national requires that the EEA national's employer stamps the application form and provides a letter confirming the EEA national's employment. Until March 2009 applications launched by family members from outside of the EEA are judged against the national immigration rules despite the ECJ's ruling in [[Metock case]] that the imposition of a requirement for prior lawful residence is unlawful under EU law.  There are also issues for spouses that are separate but not yet divorced.\n\nIn May 2009 further regulations relating EEA applications were laid before parliament.  These regulations introduced proscribed forms for requests of EEA residence documentation.  The regulations allow the Home Office to decline to consider a request for residence documentation if the proscribed form is incorrectly completed or the individual requests documentation without using an application form.  This move has brought criticism from immigration law practitioners who argue that the imposition of a proscribed form is unlawful under Directive 2004/38.\n\nIt is possible to enter the UK even without an EEA Family Permit, using an article 10 residence card,<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/entering-the-uk-as-the-holder-of-an-article-10-residence-card/entering-the-uk-as-the-holder-of-an-article-10-residence-card</ref> but immigration officers are often not aware of this option, and personal reports are discouraging.\n\nCommunicating with the Home Office is usually difficult.  The advice given on the web page is also often inconclusive, incomplete or leaving out essential rights of the applicant (see [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/eucitizens/applyingundereuropeanlaw/ applying]).

It allows EEA citizens and their family members to live and work in the UK without explicit permission.

Specifically, Kant described his proposed peace program as containing two steps.\n\nThe \"Preliminary Articles\" described the steps that should be taken immediately, or with all deliberate speed:\n\n# \"No Secret Treaty of Peace Shall Be Held Valid in Which There Is Tacitly Reserved Matter for a Future War\"\n# \"No Independent States, Large or Small, Shall Come under the Dominion of Another State by Inheritance, Exchange, Purchase, or Donation\"\n# \"[[Standing army|Standing Armies]] Shall in Time Be Totally Abolished\"\n# \"National Debts Shall Not Be Contracted with a View to the External Friction of States\"\n# \"No State Shall by Force Interfere with the Constitution or Government of Another State,\n# \"No State Shall, during War, Permit Such Acts of Hostility Which Would Make Mutual Confidence in the Subsequent Peace Impossible: Such Are the Employment of Assassins (percussores), Poisoners (venefici), Breach of Capitulation, and Incitement to Treason (perduellio) in the Opposing State\"\n\nThree Definitive Articles would provide not merely a cessation of hostilities, but a foundation on which to build a peace.\n\n# \"The Civil Constitution of Every State Should Be Republican\"\n# \"The Law of Nations Shall be Founded on a Federation of Free States\"\n# \"The Law of World Citizenship Shall Be Limited to Conditions of Universal Hospitality\"\n\n===Johann Gottlieb Fichte===\nThe year of the battle at Jena (1806), when Napoleon overwhelmed Prussia, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] in ''[[Characteristics of the Present Age]]'' described what he perceived to be a very deep and dominant historical trend:\n\n{{quote|\nThere is necessary tendency in every cultivated State to extend itself generally...

Support for the idea of establishing international law grew during that period as well. The [[Institute of International Law]] was formed in 1873 by the Belgian Jurist [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], leading to the creation of concrete legal drafts, for example by the Swiss [[Johaan Bluntschli]] in 1866.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 1883, [[James Lorimer (jurist)|James Lorimer]] published \"The Institutes of the Law of Nations\" in which he explored the idea of a world government establishing the global rule of law.

At its largest size from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. The League's goals included upholding the [[Human rights|Rights of Man]], such as the rights of non-whites, women, and soldiers; [[arms control|disarmament]], preventing war through [[collective security]], settling disputes between countries through negotiation, [[diplomacy]], and improving global [[quality of life]]. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and so depended on the [[Great power|Great Powers]] to enforce its resolutions and economic sanctions and provide an army, when needed. However, these powers proved reluctant to do so. Lacking many of the key elements necessary to maintain world peace, the League failed to prevent World War II. Hitler withdrew Germany from the League of Nations once he planned to take over Europe. The rest of the Axis powers soon followed him. Having failed its primary goal, the League of Nations fell apart. The League of Nations consisted of the Assembly, the Council, and the Permanent Secretariat. Below these were many agencies. The Assembly was where delegates from all member states conferred. Each country was allowed three representatives and one vote.\n\n===World Communism===\nAccording to [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[historical materialism]], the capitalist epoch depends on the expansion of competing geopolitical markets across the planet, atomizing the global proletariat and thus sustaining economic disparity and rivalry between markets. Eventually, this will be succeeded by a Socialist epoch in which the working class throughout the world will unite to render national distinctiveness meaningless.\n\nAlthough [[world Communism]]'s long-term goal is a worldwide [[Communist society]] that is stateless, which would entail an absence of any government, many [[anti-Communism|anti-Communists]] (especially during the [[Cold War]]) have considered it naive to think that the [[world revolution]] advocated by international Communists would lead to [[world domination]] by a single government or an alliance of several, yielding a [[de facto]] world government of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] nature.\n\nThe heyday of international Communism was the period from the end of World War I (the [[revolutions of 1917\u201323]]) through the 1950s, before the [[Sino-Soviet split]].\n\n===Halford Mackinder===\nAnticipating environmental movements for world unity, like [[Global Scenario Group]], and such concepts as the [[Planetary phase of civilization]] and [[Spaceship Earth]], British Geographer [[Sir Halford Mackinder]] wrote in 1931:\n{{quote| \nGradually as the arts of life improved, the forests were cleared and the marshes were drained, and the lesser natural regions were fused into greater.

When this control would be achieved, this power could then set up for itself a world police and assure itself \"the necessary living space.... The lower races will have to restrict themselves accordingly\".<ref name=\"Weinberg\"/>\n\nDuring its imperial period (1868\u20131947), the Japanese elaborated a worldview, \"''[[Hakk\u014d ichiu]]''\", translated as \"eight corners of the world under one roof\". This was the idea behind the attempt to establish a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] and behind the struggle for world domination.[[File:Atlanticcharter2.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[Winston Churchill]]'s edited copy of the final draft of the [[Atlantic Charter]] ]]\n\nThe [[Atlantic Charter]] was a published statement agreed between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. It was intended as the blueprint for the postwar world after [[World War II]], and turned out to be the foundation for many of the international agreements that currently shape the world. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the post-war independence of British and French possessions, and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter. The Atlantic charter was made to show the goals of the allied powers during World War II. It first started with the United States and Great Britain, and later all the allies would follow the charter. Some goals include access to raw materials, reduction of trade restrictions, and freedom from fear and wants. The name, The Atlantic Charter, came from a newspaper that coined the title. However, Winston Churchill would use it, and from then on the Atlantic Charter was the official name. In retaliation, the Axis powers would raise their morale and try to work their way into Great Britain. The Atlantic Charter was a stepping stone into the creation of the United Nations.\n\nU.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] commented: \"We must make the United Nations continue to work, and to be a going concern, to see that difficulties between nations may be settled just as we settle difficulties between States here in the United States. When Kansas and Colorado fall out over the waters in the Arkansas River, they don't go to war over it; they go to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the matter is settled in a just and honorable way. There is not a difficulty in the whole world that cannot be settled in exactly the same way in a world court\". -- President Truman's remarks in Omaha, Nebraska on June 5, 1948, at the dedication of the [[Memorial Park (Omaha)|War Memorial]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=1647|title=Public Papers Harry S.

[[Wendell Willkie]]'s book ''[[One World (book)|One World]]'', first published in 1943, sold over 2 million copies. In another, [[Emery Reves]]' book ''[[The Anatomy of Peace]]'' (1945) laid out the arguments for replacing the UN with a federal world government and quickly became the \"bible\" of world federalists. The grassroots world federalist movement in the US, led by people such as [[Grenville Clark]], [[Norman Cousins]], [[Alan Cranston]] and [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Robert Hutchins]], organized itself into increasingly larger structures, finally forming, in 1947, the [[United World Federalists]] (later renamed to World Federalist Association, then [[Citizens for Global Solutions]]), claiming membership of 47,000 in 1949.\n\nSimilar movements concurrently formed in many other countries, leading to the formation, at a 1947 meeting in Montreux, Switzerland, of a global coalition, now called [[World Federalist Movement]]. By 1950, the movement claimed 56 member groups in 22 countries, with some 156,000 members.\n\n===United Nations===\n{{Further|United Nations|United Nations Parliamentary Assembly|Garry Davis}}[[File:Emblem of the United Nations.svg|thumb|left|150px|Emblem of the [[United Nations]] ]]\n\n[[World War II]] (1939\u20131945) resulted in an unprecedented scale of destruction of lives (over 60 million dead, most of them civilians), and the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Some of the acts committed against civilians during the war were on such a massive scale of savagery, they came to be widely considered as [[crimes against humanity]] itself. As the war's conclusion drew near, many shocked voices called for the establishment of institutions able to permanently prevent deadly international conflicts. This led to the founding of the [[United Nations]] in 1945, which adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. Many, however, felt that the UN, essentially a forum for discussion and coordination between [[sovereignty|sovereign]] governments, was insufficiently empowered for the task. A number of prominent persons, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], called on governments to proceed further by taking gradual steps towards forming an effectual federal world government. The United Nations main goal is to work on international law, international security, economic development, human rights, social progress, and eventually world peace. The United Nations replaced the League of Nations in 1945, after World War II. Almost every internationally recognized country is in the U.N.; as it contains 193 member states out of the 196 total nations of the world. The United Nations gather regularly in order to solve big problems throughout the world. There are six official languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. The United Nations is also financed by some of the wealthiest nations. The flag shows the Earth from a map that shows all of the populated continents.[[File:Uno unpalogo.svg|thumb|250px|right|Emblem of the [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] ]]\n\nA [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] (UNPA) is a proposed addition to the [[United Nations System]] that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, [[direct election]] of [[United Nations]] (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide. The idea of a world parliament was raised at the founding of the [[League of Nations]] in the 1920s and again following the end of World War II in 1945, but remained dormant throughout the [[Cold War]].<ref>See a detailed history in: Jo Leinen/Andreas Bummel, [https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/world-parliament-book/ A World Parliament: Governance and Democracy in the 21st Century], Democracy Without Borders, 2018</ref> In the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of global trade and the power of world organizations that govern it led to calls for a [[International parliament|parliamentary assembly]] to scrutinize their activity.

Davis [[renunciation of United States citizenship|renounced his American citizenship]] and started a [[Registry of World Citizens]]. On September 4, 1953, Davis announced from the city hall of [[Ellsworth, Maine]] the formation of the \"World Government of World Citizens\" based on 3 \"World Laws\"\u2014One God (or Absolute Value), One World, and One Humanity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldservice.org/ells.html |title=Worldservice.org |access-date=2010-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205043653/http://www.worldservice.org/ells.html |archive-date=2010-02-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> Following this declaration, mandated, he claimed, by Article twenty one, Section three of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], he formed the United World Service Authority in New York City as the administrative agency of the new government.

Adamson Hoebel}}\n\nLegal anthropologist [[E. Adamson Hoebel]] concluded his treatise on broadening the legal realist tradition to include non-Western nations:<ref>''The Law of Primitive Man'' (1954:331\u2013333)</ref> \"Whatever the idealist may desire, force and the threat of force are the ultimate power in the determination of international behavior, as in the law within the nation or tribe. But until force and the threat of force in international relations are brought under social control by the world community, by and for the world society, they remain the instruments of social anarchy and not the sanctions of world law. The creation in clear-cut terms of the corpus of world law cries for the doing. If world law, however, is to be realized at all, there will have to be minimum of general agreement as to the nature of the physical and ideational world and the relation of men in society to it. An important and valuable next step will be found in deep-cutting analysis of the major law systems of the contemporary world in order to lay bare their basic postulates \u2013 postulates that are too generally hidden; postulates felt, perhaps, by those who live by them, but so much taken for granted that they are rarely expressed or exposed for examination. When this is done \u2013 and it will take the efforts of many keen intellects steeped in the law of at least a dozen lands and also aware of the social nexus of the law \u2013 then mankind will be able to see clearly for the first time and clearly where the common consensus of the great living social and law systems lies. Here will be found the common postulates and values upon which the world community can build. At the same time the truly basic points of conflict that will have to be worked upon for resolution will be revealed. Law is inherently purposive\".\n\n===End of the Cold War (1992)===\nWhile enthusiasm for multinational federalism in Europe incrementally led, over the following decades, to the formation of the [[European Union]], the onset of the [[Cold War]] (1945\u20131992) eliminated the prospects of any progress towards federation with a more global scope. The movement quickly shrank in size to a much smaller core of activists, and the world government idea all but disappeared from wide public discourse.\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War in 1992, interest in a federal world government and, more generally, in the global protection of human rights, was renewed. The most visible achievement of the world federalism movement during the 1990s is the [[Rome Statute]] of 1998, which led to the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2002. In [[Europe]], progress towards forming a federal union of European states gained much momentum, starting in 1952 as a trade deal between the German and French people led, in 1992, to the [[Maastricht Treaty]] that established the name and enlarged the agreement that the [[European Union]] (EU) is based upon. The EU expanded (1995, 2004, 2007, 2013) to encompass, in 2013, over half a billion people in 28 member states. Following the EU's example, the [[African Union]] was founded in 2002 and the [[Union of South American Nations]] in 2008.\n\n===  Alexander Wendt ===\nWendt defines a world state as an \u201corganization possessing a monopoly on the legitimate use of organized violence within a society.\"<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\">{{Cite journal|last=Wendt|first=Alexander|date=December 2003|title=Why a World State is Inevitable|journal=European Journal of International Relations|volume=9|issue=4|pages=491\u2013542|doi=10.1177/135406610394001|issn=1354-0661}}</ref> According to Wendt, a world state would need to fulfill the following requirements:\n\n# Monopoly on organized violence - states have exclusive use of legitimate force within their territory.\n# Legitimacy - perceived as right by their populations, and possibly the global community.\n# Sovereign - possessing common power and legitimacy.\n# Corporate action -\u00a0 a collection of individuals who act together in a systematic way.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\"/>\n\nA world government would not require a centrally controlled army or\u00a0a central decision-making body, as long as the four conditions are fulfilled.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\" /> In order to develop a world state, three changes must occur in the world system:\n\n# Universal security community - a peaceful system of binding dispute resolution without threat of interstate violence.\n# Universal collective security - unified response to crimes and threats.\n# Supranational authority - binding decisions are made that apply to each and every state.\n\nThe development of a world state is conceptualized as a process through 5 stages:\n\n# System of states;\n# Society of states;\n# World society;\n# Collective security;\n# World state.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\"/>\n\nWendt argues that a struggle among sovereign individuals results in the formation of a collective identity and eventually a state. The same forces are present within the international system and could possibly, and potentially inevitably lead to the development of a world state through this 5 stage process. When the world state would emerge, the traditional expression of states would become localized expressions of the world state. This process occurs within the default state of anarchy present in the world system.\n\nKant conceptualized the state as sovereign individuals formed out of conflict.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\"/> Part of the traditional philosophical objections to a world state (Kant, Hegel)<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\" /> are overcome by modern technological innovations. Wendt argues that new methods of communication and coordination can overcome these challenges.\n\n==Current global governance system==\n[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|250px|right|Flag of the [[United Nations]]]]\n[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|250px|right|Flag of the [[World Health Organization]]]]\n{{As of|2020}}, there is no functioning global international [[military]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], or [[constitution]] with jurisdiction over the entire planet.\n\nThe world is divided geographically and demographically into mutually exclusive territories and political structures called [[Sovereign state|states]] which are [[Independence|independent]] and [[sovereignty|sovereign]] in most cases. There are numerous bodies, institutions, unions, coalitions, agreements and contracts between these units of [[authority]], but, except in cases where a nation is under military occupation by another, ''all'' such arrangements depend on the continued consent of the participant nations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Countries that violate or do not enforce international laws may be subject to penalty or coercion often in the form of economic limitations such as [[embargo]] by cooperating countries, even if the violating country is not part of the United Nations. In this way a country's cooperation in international affairs is voluntary, but non-cooperation still has [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] consequences.\n\nAmong the voluntary organizations and international arrangements are:\n* [[International law]]: Encompassing international treaties, customs and globally accepted legal principles. With the exceptions of cases brought before the ICC and ICJ (see below), the laws are interpreted by national courts. Many violations of treaty or customary law obligations are overlooked.\n* [[United Nations]] (UN): The primary formal organization coordinating activities between states on a global scale and the only inter-governmental organization with a truly universal membership (193 governments). In addition to the main organs and various humanitarian programs and commissions of the UN itself, there are about 20 functional organizations affiliated with the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), such as the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International Labour Organization]], and [[International Telecommunications Union]].<ref>[https://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html UN.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113054148/http://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html |date=2012-01-13 }}, Chart</ref> Of particular interest politically are the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Trade Organization]].<br/>Militarily, the UN deploys [[peacekeeping]] forces, usually to build and maintain post-conflict peace and stability. When a more aggressive international military action is undertaken, either ''[[ad hoc]]'' coalitions (for example, the [[multinational force in Iraq]]) or regional [[military alliance]]s (for example, [[NATO]]) are used.\n* [[Interpol|International Criminal Police Organization]] (Interpol): The international body for coordination and collaboration between national police agencies. Also operates the global [[Interpol notice]] system which includes the Interpol Red Notice, the \"closest instrument to an international [[arrest warrant]] in use today\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |title=Interpol Red Notices |website=[[United States Attorneys' Manual]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |accessdate=1 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206195827/http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |archive-date=2013-12-06 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC): A relatively recent development in international law, the ICC (or ICCt) is the first permanent international criminal court established to ensure that the gravest international crimes ([[war crime]]s, [[genocide]], other [[crimes against humanity]], etc.) do not go unpunished. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] establishing the ICC and its jurisdiction was signed by 139 national governments, of which 100 ratified it by October 2005.\n* [[World Bank]]/[[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF): [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Formed together]] in July 1944 at the [[Mount Washington Hotel]] in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]], [[United States]] to foster global monetary cooperation and to fight poverty by financially assisting states in need. These institutions have been criticized as simply oligarchic hegemonies of the Great Powers, most notably the United States, which maintains the only veto, for instance, in the International Monetary Fund.\n* [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO): Sets the rules of international trade. It has a semi-legislative body (the General Council, reaching decisions by consensus) and a judicial body (the Dispute Settlement Body). Another influential economical international organization is the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), with membership of 30 democratic members.\n* [[G7]]: A group consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The leaders of the G7 countries meet annually in person to coordinate their policies in confronting [[global issue]]s, such as poverty, terrorism, infectious diseases, and climate change.\n* [[G20]]: An association of twenty developing and established nations and entities, including the European Union.\n\nIn addition to the formal, or semi-formal, international organizations and laws mentioned above, many other mechanisms act to regulate human activities across national borders. In particular, international trade in goods, services and currencies (the \"[[global market]]\") has a tremendous impact on the lives of people in almost all parts of the world, creating deep interdependency amongst nations (see [[globalization]]). Trans-national (or multi-national) [[corporations]], some with resources exceeding those available to most governments, govern activities of people on a global scale. The rapid increase in the volume of trans-border digital communications and mass-media distribution (e.g., [[Internet]], [[satellite television]]) has allowed information, ideas, and opinions to rapidly spread across the world, creating a complex web of international coordination and influence, mostly outside the control of any formal organizations or laws.\n\n==Existing regional unions of nations==\n{{Main|Regional organization|Supranational union}}\n\nThe only union generally recognized as having achieved the status of a supranational union is the [[European Union]].<ref name=\"Baub\u00f6ck-2007\">{{cite journal|last=Baub\u00f6ck|first=Rainer|date=2007|title=Why European Citizenship?

The European Union consists of twenty-seven European states. It has developed a \"single market\" which allows people of different countries to travel from state to state without the need for customs declarations at border security. This also includes the same policies when it comes to trading. The European Union is said to have 26% of the world's money.

The organizational center is [[\u0130stanbul]]. Additionally, the [[Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture]] was founded in [[Almaty]] in 1992 and the ''Turkic Countries Parliamentarian Assembly'' was founded in [[Baku]] in 1998. All of these organizations were coopted into the Turkic Council. The Turkic Council has an operational style similar to organization like the [[Arab League]]. The member countries are [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Turkey]]. The remaining two Turkic states, [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] are not currently official members of the council. However, due to their neutral stance, they participate in international relations and are strongly predicted to be future members of the council.

Support for the idea of establishing international law grew during that period as well. The [[Institute of International Law]] was formed in 1873 by the Belgian Jurist [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], leading to the creation of concrete legal drafts, for example by the Swiss [[Johaan Bluntschli]] in 1866.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 1883, [[James Lorimer (jurist)|James Lorimer]] published \"The Institutes of the Law of Nations\" in which he explored the idea of a world government establishing the global rule of law.

At its largest size from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. The League's goals included upholding the [[Human rights|Rights of Man]], such as the rights of non-whites, women, and soldiers; [[arms control|disarmament]], preventing war through [[collective security]], settling disputes between countries through negotiation, [[diplomacy]], and improving global [[quality of life]]. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and so depended on the [[Great power|Great Powers]] to enforce its resolutions and economic sanctions and provide an army, when needed. However, these powers proved reluctant to do so. Lacking many of the key elements necessary to maintain world peace, the League failed to prevent World War II. Hitler withdrew Germany from the League of Nations once he planned to take over Europe. The rest of the Axis powers soon followed him. Having failed its primary goal, the League of Nations fell apart. The League of Nations consisted of the Assembly, the Council, and the Permanent Secretariat. Below these were many agencies. The Assembly was where delegates from all member states conferred. Each country was allowed three representatives and one vote.\n\n===World Communism===\nAccording to [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[historical materialism]], the capitalist epoch depends on the expansion of competing geopolitical markets across the planet, atomizing the global proletariat and thus sustaining economic disparity and rivalry between markets. Eventually, this will be succeeded by a Socialist epoch in which the working class throughout the world will unite to render national distinctiveness meaningless.\n\nAlthough [[world Communism]]'s long-term goal is a worldwide [[Communist society]] that is stateless, which would entail an absence of any government, many [[anti-Communism|anti-Communists]] (especially during the [[Cold War]]) have considered it naive to think that the [[world revolution]] advocated by international Communists would lead to [[world domination]] by a single government or an alliance of several, yielding a [[de facto]] world government of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] nature.\n\nThe heyday of international Communism was the period from the end of World War I (the [[revolutions of 1917\u201323]]) through the 1950s, before the [[Sino-Soviet split]].\n\n===Halford Mackinder===\nAnticipating environmental movements for world unity, like [[Global Scenario Group]], and such concepts as the [[Planetary phase of civilization]] and [[Spaceship Earth]], British Geographer [[Sir Halford Mackinder]] wrote in 1931:\n{{quote| \nGradually as the arts of life improved, the forests were cleared and the marshes were drained, and the lesser natural regions were fused into greater.

When this control would be achieved, this power could then set up for itself a world police and assure itself \"the necessary living space.... The lower races will have to restrict themselves accordingly\".<ref name=\"Weinberg\"/>\n\nDuring its imperial period (1868\u20131947), the Japanese elaborated a worldview, \"''[[Hakk\u014d ichiu]]''\", translated as \"eight corners of the world under one roof\". This was the idea behind the attempt to establish a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] and behind the struggle for world domination.[[File:Atlanticcharter2.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[Winston Churchill]]'s edited copy of the final draft of the [[Atlantic Charter]] ]]\n\nThe [[Atlantic Charter]] was a published statement agreed between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. It was intended as the blueprint for the postwar world after [[World War II]], and turned out to be the foundation for many of the international agreements that currently shape the world. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the post-war independence of British and French possessions, and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter. The Atlantic charter was made to show the goals of the allied powers during World War II. It first started with the United States and Great Britain, and later all the allies would follow the charter. Some goals include access to raw materials, reduction of trade restrictions, and freedom from fear and wants. The name, The Atlantic Charter, came from a newspaper that coined the title. However, Winston Churchill would use it, and from then on the Atlantic Charter was the official name. In retaliation, the Axis powers would raise their morale and try to work their way into Great Britain. The Atlantic Charter was a stepping stone into the creation of the United Nations.\n\nU.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] commented: \"We must make the United Nations continue to work, and to be a going concern, to see that difficulties between nations may be settled just as we settle difficulties between States here in the United States. When Kansas and Colorado fall out over the waters in the Arkansas River, they don't go to war over it; they go to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the matter is settled in a just and honorable way. There is not a difficulty in the whole world that cannot be settled in exactly the same way in a world court\". -- President Truman's remarks in Omaha, Nebraska on June 5, 1948, at the dedication of the [[Memorial Park (Omaha)|War Memorial]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=1647|title=Public Papers Harry S.

[[Wendell Willkie]]'s book ''[[One World (book)|One World]]'', first published in 1943, sold over 2 million copies. In another, [[Emery Reves]]' book ''[[The Anatomy of Peace]]'' (1945) laid out the arguments for replacing the UN with a federal world government and quickly became the \"bible\" of world federalists. The grassroots world federalist movement in the US, led by people such as [[Grenville Clark]], [[Norman Cousins]], [[Alan Cranston]] and [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Robert Hutchins]], organized itself into increasingly larger structures, finally forming, in 1947, the [[United World Federalists]] (later renamed to World Federalist Association, then [[Citizens for Global Solutions]]), claiming membership of 47,000 in 1949.\n\nSimilar movements concurrently formed in many other countries, leading to the formation, at a 1947 meeting in Montreux, Switzerland, of a global coalition, now called [[World Federalist Movement]]. By 1950, the movement claimed 56 member groups in 22 countries, with some 156,000 members.\n\n===United Nations===\n{{Further|United Nations|United Nations Parliamentary Assembly|Garry Davis}}[[File:Emblem of the United Nations.svg|thumb|left|150px|Emblem of the [[United Nations]] ]]\n\n[[World War II]] (1939\u20131945) resulted in an unprecedented scale of destruction of lives (over 60 million dead, most of them civilians), and the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Some of the acts committed against civilians during the war were on such a massive scale of savagery, they came to be widely considered as [[crimes against humanity]] itself. As the war's conclusion drew near, many shocked voices called for the establishment of institutions able to permanently prevent deadly international conflicts. This led to the founding of the [[United Nations]] in 1945, which adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. Many, however, felt that the UN, essentially a forum for discussion and coordination between [[sovereignty|sovereign]] governments, was insufficiently empowered for the task. A number of prominent persons, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], called on governments to proceed further by taking gradual steps towards forming an effectual federal world government. The United Nations main goal is to work on international law, international security, economic development, human rights, social progress, and eventually world peace. The United Nations replaced the League of Nations in 1945, after World War II. Almost every internationally recognized country is in the U.N.; as it contains 193 member states out of the 196 total nations of the world. The United Nations gather regularly in order to solve big problems throughout the world. There are six official languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. The United Nations is also financed by some of the wealthiest nations. The flag shows the Earth from a map that shows all of the populated continents.[[File:Uno unpalogo.svg|thumb|250px|right|Emblem of the [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] ]]\n\nA [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] (UNPA) is a proposed addition to the [[United Nations System]] that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, [[direct election]] of [[United Nations]] (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide. The idea of a world parliament was raised at the founding of the [[League of Nations]] in the 1920s and again following the end of World War II in 1945, but remained dormant throughout the [[Cold War]].<ref>See a detailed history in: Jo Leinen/Andreas Bummel, [https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/world-parliament-book/ A World Parliament: Governance and Democracy in the 21st Century], Democracy Without Borders, 2018</ref> In the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of global trade and the power of world organizations that govern it led to calls for a [[International parliament|parliamentary assembly]] to scrutinize their activity.

On September 4, 1953, Davis announced from the city hall of [[Ellsworth, Maine]] the formation of the \"World Government of World Citizens\" based on 3 \"World Laws\"\u2014One God (or Absolute Value), One World, and One Humanity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldservice.org/ells.html |title=Worldservice.org |access-date=2010-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205043653/http://www.worldservice.org/ells.html |archive-date=2010-02-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> Following this declaration, mandated, he claimed, by Article twenty one, Section three of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], he formed the United World Service Authority in New York City as the administrative agency of the new government.

Adamson Hoebel}}\n\nLegal anthropologist [[E. Adamson Hoebel]] concluded his treatise on broadening the legal realist tradition to include non-Western nations:<ref>''The Law of Primitive Man'' (1954:331\u2013333)</ref> \"Whatever the idealist may desire, force and the threat of force are the ultimate power in the determination of international behavior, as in the law within the nation or tribe. But until force and the threat of force in international relations are brought under social control by the world community, by and for the world society, they remain the instruments of social anarchy and not the sanctions of world law. The creation in clear-cut terms of the corpus of world law cries for the doing. If world law, however, is to be realized at all, there will have to be minimum of general agreement as to the nature of the physical and ideational world and the relation of men in society to it. An important and valuable next step will be found in deep-cutting analysis of the major law systems of the contemporary world in order to lay bare their basic postulates \u2013 postulates that are too generally hidden; postulates felt, perhaps, by those who live by them, but so much taken for granted that they are rarely expressed or exposed for examination. When this is done \u2013 and it will take the efforts of many keen intellects steeped in the law of at least a dozen lands and also aware of the social nexus of the law \u2013 then mankind will be able to see clearly for the first time and clearly where the common consensus of the great living social and law systems lies. Here will be found the common postulates and values upon which the world community can build. At the same time the truly basic points of conflict that will have to be worked upon for resolution will be revealed. Law is inherently purposive\".\n\n===End of the Cold War (1992)===\nWhile enthusiasm for multinational federalism in Europe incrementally led, over the following decades, to the formation of the [[European Union]], the onset of the [[Cold War]] (1945\u20131992) eliminated the prospects of any progress towards federation with a more global scope. The movement quickly shrank in size to a much smaller core of activists, and the world government idea all but disappeared from wide public discourse.\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War in 1992, interest in a federal world government and, more generally, in the global protection of human rights, was renewed. The most visible achievement of the world federalism movement during the 1990s is the [[Rome Statute]] of 1998, which led to the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2002. In [[Europe]], progress towards forming a federal union of European states gained much momentum, starting in 1952 as a trade deal between the German and French people led, in 1992, to the [[Maastricht Treaty]] that established the name and enlarged the agreement that the [[European Union]] (EU) is based upon. The EU expanded (1995, 2004, 2007, 2013) to encompass, in 2013, over half a billion people in 28 member states. Following the EU's example, the [[African Union]] was founded in 2002 and the [[Union of South American Nations]] in 2008.\n\n===  Alexander Wendt ===\nWendt defines a world state as an \u201corganization possessing a monopoly on the legitimate use of organized violence within a society.\"<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\">{{Cite journal|last=Wendt|first=Alexander|date=December 2003|title=Why a World State is Inevitable|journal=European Journal of International Relations|volume=9|issue=4|pages=491\u2013542|doi=10.1177/135406610394001|issn=1354-0661}}</ref> According to Wendt, a world state would need to fulfill the following requirements:\n\n# Monopoly on organized violence - states have exclusive use of legitimate force within their territory.\n# Legitimacy - perceived as right by their populations, and possibly the global community.\n# Sovereign - possessing common power and legitimacy.\n# Corporate action -\u00a0 a collection of individuals who act together in a systematic way.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\"/>\n\nA world government would not require a centrally controlled army or\u00a0a central decision-making body, as long as the four conditions are fulfilled.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\" /> In order to develop a world state, three changes must occur in the world system:\n\n# Universal security community - a peaceful system of binding dispute resolution without threat of interstate violence.\n# Universal collective security - unified response to crimes and threats.\n# Supranational authority - binding decisions are made that apply to each and every state.\n\nThe development of a world state is conceptualized as a process through 5 stages:\n\n# System of states;\n# Society of states;\n# World society;\n# Collective security;\n# World state.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\"/>\n\nWendt argues that a struggle among sovereign individuals results in the formation of a collective identity and eventually a state. The same forces are present within the international system and could possibly, and potentially inevitably lead to the development of a world state through this 5 stage process. When the world state would emerge, the traditional expression of states would become localized expressions of the world state. This process occurs within the default state of anarchy present in the world system.\n\nKant conceptualized the state as sovereign individuals formed out of conflict.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\"/> Part of the traditional philosophical objections to a world state (Kant, Hegel)<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\" /> are overcome by modern technological innovations. Wendt argues that new methods of communication and coordination can overcome these challenges.\n\n==Current global governance system==\n[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|250px|right|Flag of the [[United Nations]]]]\n[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|250px|right|Flag of the [[World Health Organization]]]]\n{{As of|2020}}, there is no functioning global international [[military]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], or [[constitution]] with jurisdiction over the entire planet.\n\nThe world is divided geographically and demographically into mutually exclusive territories and political structures called [[Sovereign state|states]] which are [[Independence|independent]] and [[sovereignty|sovereign]] in most cases. There are numerous bodies, institutions, unions, coalitions, agreements and contracts between these units of [[authority]], but, except in cases where a nation is under military occupation by another, ''all'' such arrangements depend on the continued consent of the participant nations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Countries that violate or do not enforce international laws may be subject to penalty or coercion often in the form of economic limitations such as [[embargo]] by cooperating countries, even if the violating country is not part of the United Nations. In this way a country's cooperation in international affairs is voluntary, but non-cooperation still has [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] consequences.\n\nAmong the voluntary organizations and international arrangements are:\n* [[International law]]: Encompassing international treaties, customs and globally accepted legal principles. With the exceptions of cases brought before the ICC and ICJ (see below), the laws are interpreted by national courts. Many violations of treaty or customary law obligations are overlooked.\n* [[United Nations]] (UN): The primary formal organization coordinating activities between states on a global scale and the only inter-governmental organization with a truly universal membership (193 governments). In addition to the main organs and various humanitarian programs and commissions of the UN itself, there are about 20 functional organizations affiliated with the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), such as the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International Labour Organization]], and [[International Telecommunications Union]].<ref>[https://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html UN.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113054148/http://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html |date=2012-01-13 }}, Chart</ref> Of particular interest politically are the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Trade Organization]].<br/>Militarily, the UN deploys [[peacekeeping]] forces, usually to build and maintain post-conflict peace and stability. When a more aggressive international military action is undertaken, either ''[[ad hoc]]'' coalitions (for example, the [[multinational force in Iraq]]) or regional [[military alliance]]s (for example, [[NATO]]) are used.\n* [[Interpol|International Criminal Police Organization]] (Interpol): The international body for coordination and collaboration between national police agencies. Also operates the global [[Interpol notice]] system which includes the Interpol Red Notice, the \"closest instrument to an international [[arrest warrant]] in use today\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |title=Interpol Red Notices |website=[[United States Attorneys' Manual]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |accessdate=1 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206195827/http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |archive-date=2013-12-06 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC): A relatively recent development in international law, the ICC (or ICCt) is the first permanent international criminal court established to ensure that the gravest international crimes ([[war crime]]s, [[genocide]], other [[crimes against humanity]], etc.) do not go unpunished. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] establishing the ICC and its jurisdiction was signed by 139 national governments, of which 100 ratified it by October 2005.\n* [[World Bank]]/[[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF): [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Formed together]] in July 1944 at the [[Mount Washington Hotel]] in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]], [[United States]] to foster global monetary cooperation and to fight poverty by financially assisting states in need. These institutions have been criticized as simply oligarchic hegemonies of the Great Powers, most notably the United States, which maintains the only veto, for instance, in the International Monetary Fund.\n* [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO): Sets the rules of international trade. It has a semi-legislative body (the General Council, reaching decisions by consensus) and a judicial body (the Dispute Settlement Body). Another influential economical international organization is the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), with membership of 30 democratic members.\n* [[G7]]: A group consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The leaders of the G7 countries meet annually in person to coordinate their policies in confronting [[global issue]]s, such as poverty, terrorism, infectious diseases, and climate change.\n* [[G20]]: An association of twenty developing and established nations and entities, including the European Union.\n\nIn addition to the formal, or semi-formal, international organizations and laws mentioned above, many other mechanisms act to regulate human activities across national borders. In particular, international trade in goods, services and currencies (the \"[[global market]]\") has a tremendous impact on the lives of people in almost all parts of the world, creating deep interdependency amongst nations (see [[globalization]]). Trans-national (or multi-national) [[corporations]], some with resources exceeding those available to most governments, govern activities of people on a global scale. The rapid increase in the volume of trans-border digital communications and mass-media distribution (e.g., [[Internet]], [[satellite television]]) has allowed information, ideas, and opinions to rapidly spread across the world, creating a complex web of international coordination and influence, mostly outside the control of any formal organizations or laws.\n\n==Existing regional unions of nations==\n{{Main|Regional organization|Supranational union}}\n\nThe only union generally recognized as having achieved the status of a supranational union is the [[European Union]].<ref name=\"Baub\u00f6ck-2007\">{{cite journal|last=Baub\u00f6ck|first=Rainer|date=2007|title=Why European Citizenship?

A multitude of [[trade bloc|regional associations]], aggregating most nations of the world, are at different stages of development towards a growing extent of economic, and sometimes political, integration. The European Union consists of twenty-seven European states. It has developed a \"single market\" which allows people of different countries to travel from state to state without the need for customs declarations at border security. This also includes the same policies when it comes to trading. The European Union is said to have 26% of the world's money. Not all EU member states use the Euro; Poland for example, retains the [[Zloty]]. Where the Euro is in place, it allows easy access for the free circulation of trade goods.

Despite the presence of secularist, nationalist and socialist ideologies in modern Muslim states, they have cooperated to form the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The formation of the OIC happened in the backdrop of the loss of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. The final cause sufficiently compelled leaders of Muslim nations to meet in Rabat to establish the OIC on September 25, 1969.<ref name=EIMW>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52 |title={title} |access-date=2010-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314053224/http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52 |archive-date=2010-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{POV statement|date=January 2013}}\n\nAccording to its charter, the OIC aims to preserve Islamic social and economic values; promote solidarity amongst member states; increase cooperation in social, economic, cultural, scientific, and political areas; uphold international peace and security; and advance education, particularly in the fields of science and technology.<ref name=EIMW/>\n\nOn August 5, 1990, 45 foreign ministers of the OIC adopted the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] to serve as a guidance for the member states in the matters of human rights in as much as they are compatible with the [[Sharia]], or Quranic Law.<ref name=CDHRII>{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html|title=Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam|date=August 5, 1990|access-date=2010-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603093031/http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html|archive-date=2010-06-03|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Turkic Council===\n[[File:Conseilturcique.svg|thumb|210px|left|{{legend|#00a8a6|Official members}} {{legend|#4fa6cf|Prospective future members}} {{legend|#4fa62e|[[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] {{small|(only recognized by [[Turkey]])}}}}]]\n\nThe [[Turkic Council]] is an international organization comprising Turkic countries. Since 1992, the ''Turkic Language Speaking Countries Summit'' has been organizing amongst the Turkic countries. On October 3, 2009, four of these countries signed the Nahcivan Agreement. The organizational center is [[\u0130stanbul]]. Additionally, the [[Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture]] was founded in [[Almaty]] in 1992 and the ''Turkic Countries Parliamentarian Assembly'' was founded in [[Baku]] in 1998. All of these organizations were coopted into the Turkic Council. The Turkic Council has an operational style similar to organization like the [[Arab League]]. The member countries are [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Turkey]]. The remaining two Turkic states, [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] are not currently official members of the council. However, due to their neutral stance, they participate in international relations and are strongly predicted to be future members of the council. The idea of setting up this cooperative council was first put forward by Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] back in 2006.\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Eurasian Economic Union===\n\n[[File:Eurasian Economic Union.svg|thumb|400px|The [[Eurasian Economic Union]]]]\nThe Eurasian Economic Union was founded in January 2015, consisting of [[Armenia]], [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], Russia and observer member [[Moldova]], all of them being previous members of the Soviet Union.
