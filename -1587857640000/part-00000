As a teenager, the younger Jury sold light bulbs supplied by his father door-to-door, then worked in an electrical contractor's shop before becoming an electrician himself.<ref name=\"ABQJournal1987\" />\n\nThe Jurys and Meredith considered several locations for their business and settled on founding the company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The co-founders figured \u201ca service-oriented distributor could scrape its way into the market and compete against bigger companies,\u201d the younger Jury said in a 1987 article in the ''Albuquerque Journal Business Outlook''.<ref name=\"ABQJournal1987\" />\n\nSummit opened its first service center with five employees on August 15, 1977. By the year's end, Summit's sales totaled $408,000.<ref name=\"SummitAboutUs\" /><ref name=\"ABQJournal1987\" />\n\nIn 1979, Summit opened a second location in Grants, New Mexico then moved into a new headquarters building the following year. After purchasing a branch of Cummins Utility Supply Co. in 1983, Summit opened another location in Farmington, New Mexico. That same year the company also took its first Just-in-Time (JIT) systems contract with the Rio Rancho, New Mexico facility of international chip manufacturer [[Intel|Intel Corp.]]<ref name=\"EW1989\" /><ref name=\"ABQJournal1987\" />\n\nIn a JIT systems contract, distributors are required to deliver specified products to their customer's facility within 24 hours; in turn, the customer agrees to purchase all of their materials exclusively from that distributor.<ref name=\"ABQJournal1987\" /> By 1986, Summit also had JIT systems contracts in place with [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Other customers included [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], the City of Albuquerque, [[Albuquerque Public Schools]], and the [[University Of New Mexico|University of New Mexico]].<ref name=\"ABQJournal1987\" />\n\nBy the end of the 1987 fiscal year, Summit's 10th year in business, Summit had 76 employees in three locations and company sales were $15.7 million.<ref name=\"SummitTimeline\" /><ref name=\"SummitAboutUs\" /><ref name=\"ABQJournal1987\" /> That year, Summit introduced the 30-Second Counter Service Guarantee\u00ae that said customers would receive counter service within 30 seconds or receive a Summit Buck\u00ae worth $5 toward their purchase. The company also began expanding its operations into Texas and opened its first Texas branch in Dallas, which originally operated under the name Sierra Electric Supply.\n\n===1988 to 2008===\nCo-founder Victor Jury Sr. relocated to Summit's Fort Worth branch when it opened in 1988 and announced his retirement in 1990. The younger Jury became Summit's president and CEO. Co-founder David Meredith announced his retirement in 1999.\n\nSummit first appeared in electrical distribution industry rankings in 1988 when ''Electrical Wholesaling'' magazine ranked Summit 173rd on its list of the top 250 U.S. electrical distributors.<ref name=\"SummitTimeline\" />\n\nIn 1989, ''Electrical Wholesaling'' detailed Summit's expertise with JIT systems contracts in an article that gave Summit recognition in the industry for its rapid growth and unique service offerings.<ref name=\"EW1989\" /> By 1993, Summit had opened three more locations, moved its headquarters to a new building in Albuquerque, and introduced the 20/20 Will Call Service Guarantee\u00ae, which guaranteed call-in orders would be ready in 20 minutes.\n\nDuring those four years, Summit's annual sales went from $18.6 million in 1989 to over $65 million by 1993,<ref name=\"SummitAboutUs\" /> causing the company to jump 125 spots to rank 48th on ''Electrical Wholesaling'' magazine's top 250 list. Summit also ranked 16th on the ''New Mexico Business Weekly\u2019s'' Private 100, which recognized New Mexico's top privately owned companies.\n\nWhen the company was founded, Summit made an early commitment to service and quality.<ref name=\"ABQJournal1987\" /> This led Summit to support its objectives with an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] registration. In 1994, Summit earned an umbrella ISO registration, which certified all of Summit's locations to ISO 9002 quality standards. The company maintained the registration, developed by the International Organization for Standardization, until 2007.

Libertalia got its name from the latin word ''Liberi'' which means \"free\". Misson's idea was to have his society be a society in which people of all colors, creeds, and beliefs were to be free of any scrutiny.

After the [[American Revolution]], pirates fleeing from [[England]] were wrecked on an island and set up their own Libertatia.

They shared the wealth of the ship, deciding \"all should be in common.\"<ref name=\"mission\"/> All decisions were to be put to \"the Vote of the whole Company.\" Thus they set out on their new \"Life of Liberty.\" Off the west coast of Africa they captured a Dutch [[slave ship]]. The slaves were freed and brought aboard the ''Victoire'', Misson declaring that \"the Trading for those of our own Species, cou'd never be agreeable to the Eyes of divine Justice: That no Man had Power of Liberty of another\" and that \"he had not exempted his Neck from the galling Yoak of Slavery, and asserted his own Liberty, to enslave others.\" At every engagement they added to their numbers with new French, English and Dutch recruits, and freed African slaves.  \n[[File:Pirate Flag of Thomas Tew.svg|thumb|Sigil of Thomas Tew, a significant figure in the proposed growth of Libertalia]]\nAfter the foundation of Libertalia, Misson's ship stumbled upon Thomas Tew who followed Misson back to Libertalia. Tew had no idea such a society could be established, Tew had lost his quartermaster and 23 men of his crew when they had left to form a settlement further up the Madagascan coast. The Libertalians would capture slave ships and allow the slaves to join their colony. Off the coast of Angola, Tew and his men captured another English slave ship along with 240 men, women, and children. Many slave families were reunited with their family members at Libertalia. Most of the freed slaves were eager to join the colony that gave them a second chance. Captain Misson sailed off the coast of Cape Infantes, where his sloop was engulfed in a storm and sank. \n\nMisson was known for his role as founder of Libertalia and the radical ideas that it represented. These radical ideas and stories that were associated with Misson resonated throughout the world, and most importantly throughout the pirate community. Misson and the rest of the pirate community were strongly opposed to the various forms of authoritarian social constructs such as monarchies, slavery, and capital. These same pirates practiced forms of direct democracies that are similar to the democracies of 21st century. They envisioned a society where the people as a whole held the authority to make laws and rules, and used systems of councils with elected delegates. Pirates were strong anti-capitalists, who opposed the dispossession that followed the histories ascent of wage labor and capitalism. The society that they had established was a form of direct democracy intertwined with a socialist economy. They believed that \"Every man was born free, and had as much right to what would support him, as to the air he respired.\" They also believed that vices of wealth created \"wretchedly miserable\" people. They spoke of the \"natural right\" to \"a share of the earth as is necessary for our support.\" They saw piracy as a war of self-preservation, which justified their actions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brethrencoast.com/pirate/James_Misson.html|title=James Misson|website=brethrencoast.com|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref>\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Picture of The Antongil Bay.svg|thumb|The Antongil Bay. A possible location of Libertatia.]]\nWhile cruising round the coast of Madagascar, Misson found a perfect bay in an area with fertile soil, fresh water and friendly natives. Here the pirates built Libertalia, renouncing their titles of English, French, Dutch or African and calling themselves Liberi. They created their own language, a polyglot mixture of African languages, combined with French, English, Dutch, Portuguese and native [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]. Shortly after the beginning of building work on the colony of Libertalia, the Victoire ran into the pirate Thomas Tew, who decided to accompany them back to Libertalia. Such a colony was no new idea to Tew; he had lost his quartermaster and 23 of his crew when they had left to form a settlement further up the Madagascan coast. The Liberi - \"Enemies to Slavery,\" aimed to boost their numbers by capturing another slave ship. Off the coast of Angola, Tew's crew took an English slave ship with 240 men, women and children below decks. The African members of the pirate crew discovered many friends and relatives among the enslaved and struck off their fetters and handcuffs, regaling them with the glories of their new life of liberty.\n\nThe pirates settled down to become farmers, holding the land in common &ndash; \"no Hedge bounded any particular Man's Property.\" Prizes and money taken at sea were \"carry'd into the common Treasury, Money being of no Use where every Thing was in common.\"\n\n==Settlement==\n\nThe consensus of modern scholarship is that Libertalia (or Libertatia) was not a real place.<ref name=\"Little-The Golden Age of Piracy\">{{cite book|last1=Little|first1=Benerson|title=The Golden Age of Piracy: The Truth Behind Pirate Myths|date=2016|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9781510713048|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2uIDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover|accessdate=15 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> Journalist Kevin Rushby toured the area seeking descendants of pirate inhabitants but declined to search the jungles for Libertalia, noting \u201cothers have tried and failed many times.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rushby|first1=Kevin|title=Hunting Pirate Heaven: In Search of Lost Pirate Utopias|date=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|location=New York|isbn=9780802779779|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxCiAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}</ref> There were pirate settlements on and around Madagascar, on which Libertalia may have been based: [[Abraham Samuel]] at [[Fort Dauphin (Madagascar)|Port Dauphin]], [[Adam Baldridge]] at [[Ile Ste.-Marie]], and [[James Plaintain]] at [[Rantabe|Ranter Bay]] were all ex-pirates who founded trading posts and towns.

They called themselves ''Liberi'', and lived under a communal city rule, a sort of worker owned corporation of piracy.

In Rome he ran into Caraccioli &ndash; a \"lewd Priest\" who over the course of long voyages with little to do but talk, gradually converted Misson and a sizeable portion of the rest of the crew to his way of thinking:\n\n{{quote|he fell upon Government, and shew'd, that every Man was born free, and had as much Right to what would support him, as to the Air he respired... that the vast Difference betwixt Man and Man, the one wallowing in Luxury, and the other in the most pinching Necessity, was owing only to Avarice and Ambition on the one Hand, and a pusillanimous Subjection on the other.<ref>{{cite book|last=Defoe|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Defoe|title=A General History of the Pyrates|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|page=389|isbn=978-0486404882|date=1999-01-26}}</ref>}}Embarking on a career of piracy, the 200 strong crew of the ''Victoire'' called upon Misson to be their captain. They shared the wealth of the ship, deciding \"all should be in common.\"<ref name=\"mission\"/> All decisions were to be put to \"the Vote of the whole Company.\" Thus they set out on their new \"Life of Liberty.\" Off the west coast of Africa they captured a Dutch [[slave ship]]. The slaves were freed and brought aboard the ''Victoire'', Misson declaring that \"the Trading for those of our own Species, cou'd never be agreeable to the Eyes of divine Justice: That no Man had Power of Liberty of another\" and that \"he had not exempted his Neck from the galling Yoak of Slavery, and asserted his own Liberty, to enslave others.\" At every engagement they added to their numbers with new French, English and Dutch recruits, and freed African slaves.  \n[[File:Pirate Flag of Thomas Tew.svg|thumb|Sigil of Thomas Tew, a significant figure in the proposed growth of Libertalia]]\nAfter the foundation of Libertalia, Misson's ship stumbled upon Thomas Tew who followed Misson back to Libertalia. Tew had no idea such a society could be established, Tew had lost his quartermaster and 23 men of his crew when they had left to form a settlement further up the Madagascan coast. The Libertalians would capture slave ships and allow the slaves to join their colony. Off the coast of Angola, Tew and his men captured another English slave ship along with 240 men, women, and children. Many slave families were reunited with their family members at Libertalia. Most of the freed slaves were eager to join the colony that gave them a second chance. Captain Misson sailed off the coast of Cape Infantes, where his sloop was engulfed in a storm and sank. \n\nMisson was known for his role as founder of Libertalia and the radical ideas that it represented. These radical ideas and stories that were associated with Misson resonated throughout the world, and most importantly throughout the pirate community. Misson and the rest of the pirate community were strongly opposed to the various forms of authoritarian social constructs such as monarchies, slavery, and capital. These same pirates practiced forms of direct democracies that are similar to the democracies of 21st century. They envisioned a society where the people as a whole held the authority to make laws and rules, and used systems of councils with elected delegates. Pirates were strong anti-capitalists, who opposed the dispossession that followed the histories ascent of wage labor and capitalism. The society that they had established was a form of direct democracy intertwined with a socialist economy. They believed that \"Every man was born free, and had as much right to what would support him, as to the air he respired.\" They also believed that vices of wealth created \"wretchedly miserable\" people. They spoke of the \"natural right\" to \"a share of the earth as is necessary for our support.\" They saw piracy as a war of self-preservation, which justified their actions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brethrencoast.com/pirate/James_Misson.html|title=James Misson|website=brethrencoast.com|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref>\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Picture of The Antongil Bay.svg|thumb|The Antongil Bay. A possible location of Libertatia.]]\nWhile cruising round the coast of Madagascar, Misson found a perfect bay in an area with fertile soil, fresh water and friendly natives. Here the pirates built Libertalia, renouncing their titles of English, French, Dutch or African and calling themselves Liberi. They created their own language, a polyglot mixture of African languages, combined with French, English, Dutch, Portuguese and native [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]. Shortly after the beginning of building work on the colony of Libertalia, the Victoire ran into the pirate Thomas Tew, who decided to accompany them back to Libertalia. Such a colony was no new idea to Tew; he had lost his quartermaster and 23 of his crew when they had left to form a settlement further up the Madagascan coast. The Liberi - \"Enemies to Slavery,\" aimed to boost their numbers by capturing another slave ship. Off the coast of Angola, Tew's crew took an English slave ship with 240 men, women and children below decks. The African members of the pirate crew discovered many friends and relatives among the enslaved and struck off their fetters and handcuffs, regaling them with the glories of their new life of liberty.\n\nThe pirates settled down to become farmers, holding the land in common &ndash; \"no Hedge bounded any particular Man's Property.\" Prizes and money taken at sea were \"carry'd into the common Treasury, Money being of no Use where every Thing was in common.\"\n\n==Settlement==\n\nThe consensus of modern scholarship is that Libertalia (or Libertatia) was not a real place.<ref name=\"Little-The Golden Age of Piracy\">{{cite book|last1=Little|first1=Benerson|title=The Golden Age of Piracy: The Truth Behind Pirate Myths|date=2016|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9781510713048|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2uIDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover|accessdate=15 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> Journalist Kevin Rushby toured the area seeking descendants of pirate inhabitants but declined to search the jungles for Libertalia, noting \u201cothers have tried and failed many times.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rushby|first1=Kevin|title=Hunting Pirate Heaven: In Search of Lost Pirate Utopias|date=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|location=New York|isbn=9780802779779|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxCiAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}</ref> There were pirate settlements on and around Madagascar, on which Libertalia may have been based: [[Abraham Samuel]] at [[Fort Dauphin (Madagascar)|Port Dauphin]], [[Adam Baldridge]] at [[Ile Ste.-Marie]], and [[James Plaintain]] at [[Rantabe|Ranter Bay]] were all ex-pirates who founded trading posts and towns.

The settlement was proposed to have an elevated fort on each side of the harbor with 40 guns in each fort, from the ''Portuguese''. Below the fort, under the protection of the forts, was where the living quarters along with the rest of the town was located. Libertalia was located roughly 13 miles east-south-east of the nearest of the nearest civilization.
