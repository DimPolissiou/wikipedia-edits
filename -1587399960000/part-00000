His prolific output includes songs, choral music, chamber pieces, and solo piano works, but he is best known for his orchestral music. In addition to a series of [[symphonic poems]] he wrote seven symphonies and was for a time widely regarded as the leading British symphonist.\n\nBax was born in the London suburb of [[Streatham]] to a prosperous family. He was encouraged by his parents to pursue a career in music, and his private income enabled him to follow his own path as a composer without regard for fashion or orthodoxy. Consequently, he came to be regarded in musical circles as an important but isolated figure. While still a student at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] Bax became fascinated with Ireland and [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] culture, which became a strong influence on his early development. In the years before the First World War he lived in Ireland and became a member of Dublin literary circles, writing fiction and verse under the pseudonym Dermot O'Byrne. Later, he developed an affinity with [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] culture, which for a time superseded his Celtic influences in the years after the First World War.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1920 Bax wrote a large amount of music, including the symphonic poem ''[[Tintagel (Bax)|Tintagel]]'', his best-known work. During this period he formed a lifelong association with the pianist [[Harriet Cohen]]&nbsp;\u2013 at first an affair, then a friendship, and always a close professional relationship. In the 1920s he began the series of seven symphonies which form the heart of his orchestral output. In 1942 Bax was appointed [[Master of the Queen's Music|Master of the King's Music]], but composed little in that capacity. In his last years he found his music regarded as old-fashioned, and after his death it was generally neglected. From the 1960s onwards, mainly through a growing number of commercial recordings, his music was gradually rediscovered, although little of it is heard with any frequency in the concert hall.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early years===\nBax was born in Heath Villa, Angles Road (now 13 Pendennis Road) in the London suburb of [[Streatham]], [[Surrey]], to a prosperous Victorian family.<ref name=p7 /> He was the eldest son of Alfred Ridley Bax (1844\u20131918) and his wife, Charlotte Ellen, ''n\u00e9e'' Lea (1860\u20131940).<ref name=dnb>Foreman, Lewis.

In 1908 he began a [[trilogy]] of tone poems called ''Eire'' (I. ''Into the Twilight'' / II. ''In the Fa\u00ebry Hills'' / III. ''Roscatha''), described by his biographer Lewis Foreman as the beginning of the composer's truly mature style. The first of these pieces, ''Into the Twilight'', was premiered by [[Thomas Beecham]] and the New Symphony Orchestra in April 1909, and the following year, at Elgar's instigation, [[Henry Wood]] commissioned the second in the cycle, ''[[In the Fa\u00ebry Hills]]''.<ref name=f66>Foreman (1971), p. 66</ref> The work received mixed notices.

He was in pursuit of Natalia Skarzhynska (daughter of philanthropist [[Kateryna Skarzhynska]]), a young Ukrainian whom he had met in London&nbsp;\u2013 one of several women with whom he fell in love over the years.<ref name=f67>Foreman (1983), p. 67</ref> The visit eventually proved a failure from the romantic point of view but musically enriched him.

Among his better-known works from the period are the orchestral [[symphonic poem|tone poems]] ''[[November Woods]]'' (1916) and ''[[Tintagel (Bax)|Tintagel]]'' (1917\u201319).<ref name=grove/>\n\n[[File:Sackville Street (Dublin) after the 1916 Easter Rising.JPG|alt=external scene showing ruined buildings in a city street|thumb|left|The [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin and its aftermath shocked and distressed Bax.]]\n{{Quote box|width=25%|bgcolor=#D8F6CE|align=right|quote=<poem>And when the devil's made us wise\nEach in his own peculiar hell\nWith desert hearts and drunken eyes\nWe're free to sentimentalise\nBy corners where the martyrs fell.</poem>|salign = right|source= From Bax's poem \"A Dublin Ballad\", 1916.<ref>O'Byrne, p. 63</ref>}}\nDuring his time in Dublin Bax had made many republican friends. The Easter rising in April 1916 and the subsequent execution of the ringleaders shocked him deeply. He expressed his feelings in some of his music such as the orchestral ''In Memoriam'' and the \"Elegiac Trio\" for flute, viola, and harp (1916), as well as in his poetry.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nIn addition to his Irish influences, Bax also drew on a Nordic tradition, being inspired by the Norwegian poet [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]] and Icelandic sagas. Bax's Symphonic Variations for Piano and Orchestra (1917) is seen by the [[musicologist]] [[Julian Herbage]] as the turning-point from the Celtic to the Nordic in Bax's oeuvre; Herbage views it as a further indication of the shift that ''Winter Legends'', composed thirteen years later, has a Nordic rather than a Celtic setting.<ref name=archive/>\n\nDuring the war Bax began an affair with the pianist [[Harriet Cohen]], for whom he left his wife and children.{{refn|The affair was not publicly known, though it was common knowledge in musical circles; Vaughan Williams was greatly amused to find in a musical dictionary an entry for Harriet Cohen which read, \"\u2013 see under Bax\".<ref>Rothwell, p. 154</ref> Elsita Bax refused her husband a divorce, and remained his wife until her death in 1947.<ref name=p10>Parlett, p. 10</ref>|group= n}} Musically, she was his muse for the rest of his life; he wrote numerous pieces for her, and she was the dedicatee of eighteen of his works.<ref>Parlett, p. 321</ref> He took a flat in [[Swiss Cottage]], London, where he lived until the start of the Second World War.

The many substantial works he wrote during the war years were heard in public, and he started writing symphonies. Few English composers had so far written symphonies that occupied a secure place in the repertoire, the best known being Elgar ([[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|A{{music|flat}}]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Elgar)|E{{music|flat}}]] symphonies) and Vaughan Williams (''[[A Sea Symphony|Sea]]'', ''[[A London Symphony|London]]'' and ''[[A Pastoral Symphony|Pastoral]]'' symphonies).<ref>Scott-Sutherland, p. 117</ref> During the 1920s and into the 1930s Bax was seen by many as the leading British symphonist.<ref name=grove/>\n[[File:Harriet-Cohen-1922.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=profile of young woman with dark hair|[[Harriet Cohen]], Bax's muse, in 1920]]\nBax's [[Symphony No. 1 (Bax)|First Symphony]] was written in 1921\u201322, and when first given it was a great success, despite its ferocity of tone.

The Cello Concerto (1932) was commissioned by and dedicated to [[Gaspar Cassad\u00f3]], who quickly dropped the work from his repertoire.

In a study of the seven, David Cox wrote in 1967 that they were \"often dismissed as amorphous by those who imagine that Bax consists only of Celtic mistiness and 'atmosphere'.

He rates the Second Violin Sonata (1915) as the composer's most individual work to that date. For Evans, the culminating point of Bax's early chamber music was the Piano Quintet, a work \"of such richness of invention that it would be an ornament to the musical literature of any country or period\".<ref>Evans (April 1919), p. 154</ref> Foreman makes particular mention of the First String Quartet (1918&nbsp;\u2013 \"a classical clarity of texture and form to its Celtic inspiration\", and the \"grittier\" Second Quartet (1925), the Viola Sonata (1922), the Phantasy Sonata for viola and harp (1927) and the Sonata for Flute and Harp (1928).<ref name=grove/>\n\nThe composer and musical scholar [[Christopher Palmer]] writes that Bax was unusual among British composers in composing a substantial oeuvre for solo piano.{{refn|Palmer comments that of the major British composers, Elgar, Delius, Vaughan Williams, Holst, Walton and Britten showed little interest in the solo piano and seldom wrote for it.<ref name=cp2>Palmer, Christopher (1988).

His prolific output includes songs, choral music, chamber pieces, and solo piano works, but he is best known for his orchestral music. In addition to a series of [[symphonic poems]] he wrote seven symphonies and was for a time widely regarded as the leading British symphonist.\n\nBax was born in the London suburb of [[Streatham]] to a prosperous family. He was encouraged by his parents to pursue a career in music, and his private income enabled him to follow his own path as a composer without regard for fashion or orthodoxy. Consequently, he came to be regarded in musical circles as an important but isolated figure. While still a student at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] Bax became fascinated with Ireland and [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] culture, which became a strong influence on his early development. In the years before the First World War he lived in Ireland and became a member of Dublin literary circles, writing fiction and verse under the pseudonym Dermot O'Byrne. Later, he developed an affinity with [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] culture, which for a time superseded his Celtic influences in the years after the First World War.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1920 Bax wrote a large amount of music, including the symphonic poem ''[[Tintagel (Bax)|Tintagel]]'', his best-known work. During this period he formed a lifelong association with the pianist [[Harriet Cohen]]&nbsp;\u2013 at first an affair, then a friendship, and always a close professional relationship. In the 1920s he began the series of seven symphonies which form the heart of his orchestral output. In 1942 Bax was appointed [[Master of the Queen's Music|Master of the King's Music]], but composed little in that capacity. In his last years he found his music regarded as old-fashioned, and after his death it was generally neglected. From the 1960s onwards, mainly through a growing number of commercial recordings, his music was gradually rediscovered, although little of it is heard with any frequency in the concert hall.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early years===\nBax was born in Heath Villa, Angles Road (now 13 Pendennis Road) in the London suburb of [[Streatham]], [[Surrey]], to a prosperous Victorian family.<ref name=p7 /> He was the eldest son of Alfred Ridley Bax (1844\u20131918) and his wife, Charlotte Ellen, ''n\u00e9e'' Lea (1860\u20131940).<ref name=dnb>Foreman, Lewis.

In 1908 he began a [[trilogy]] of tone poems called ''Eire'' (I. ''Into the Twilight'' / II. ''In the Fa\u00ebry Hills'' / III. ''Roscatha''), described by his biographer Lewis Foreman as the beginning of the composer's truly mature style. The first of these pieces, ''Into the Twilight'', was premiered by [[Thomas Beecham]] and the New Symphony Orchestra in April 1909, and the following year, at Elgar's instigation, [[Henry Wood]] commissioned the second in the cycle, ''[[In the Fa\u00ebry Hills]]''.<ref name=f66>Foreman (1971), p. 66</ref> The work received mixed notices.

Among his better-known works from the period are the orchestral [[symphonic poem|tone poems]] ''[[November Woods]]'' (1916) and ''[[Tintagel (Bax)|Tintagel]]'' (1917\u201319).<ref name=grove/>\n\n[[File:Sackville Street (Dublin) after the 1916 Easter Rising.JPG|alt=external scene showing ruined buildings in a city street|thumb|left|The [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin and its aftermath shocked and distressed Bax.]]\n{{Quote box|width=25%|bgcolor=#D8F6CE|align=right|quote=<poem>And when the devil's made us wise\nEach in his own peculiar hell\nWith desert hearts and drunken eyes\nWe're free to sentimentalise\nBy corners where the martyrs fell.</poem>|salign = right|source= From Bax's poem \"A Dublin Ballad\", 1916.<ref>O'Byrne, p. 63</ref>}}\nDuring his time in Dublin Bax had made many republican friends.

Bax's Symphonic Variations for Piano and Orchestra (1917) is seen by the [[musicologist]] [[Julian Herbage]] as the turning-point from the Celtic to the Nordic in Bax's oeuvre; Herbage views it as a further indication of the shift that ''Winter Legends'', composed thirteen years later, has a Nordic rather than a Celtic setting.<ref name=archive/>\n\nDuring the war Bax began an affair with the pianist [[Harriet Cohen]], for whom he left his wife and children.{{refn|The affair was not publicly known, though it was common knowledge in musical circles; Vaughan Williams was greatly amused to find in a musical dictionary an entry for Harriet Cohen which read, \"\u2013 see under Bax\".<ref>Rothwell, p. 154</ref> Elsita Bax refused her husband a divorce, and remained his wife until her death in 1947.<ref name=p10>Parlett, p. 10</ref>|group= n}} Musically, she was his muse for the rest of his life; he wrote numerous pieces for her, and she was the dedicatee of eighteen of his works.<ref>Parlett, p. 321</ref> He took a flat in [[Swiss Cottage]], London, where he lived until the start of the Second World War.

He rates the Second Violin Sonata (1915) as the composer's most individual work to that date. For Evans, the culminating point of Bax's early chamber music was the Piano Quintet, a work \"of such richness of invention that it would be an ornament to the musical literature of any country or period\".<ref>Evans (April 1919), p. 154</ref> Foreman makes particular mention of the First String Quartet (1918&nbsp;\u2013 \"a classical clarity of texture and form to its Celtic inspiration\", and the \"grittier\" Second Quartet (1925), the Viola Sonata (1922), the Phantasy Sonata for viola and harp (1927) and the Sonata for Flute and Harp (1928).<ref name=grove/>\n\nThe composer and musical scholar [[Christopher Palmer]] writes that Bax was unusual among British composers in composing a substantial oeuvre for solo piano.{{refn|Palmer comments that of the major British composers, Elgar, Delius, Vaughan Williams, Holst, Walton and Britten showed little interest in the solo piano and seldom wrote for it.<ref name=cp2>Palmer, Christopher (1988). Notes to Chandos CD 8497, {{OCLC|602145160}}</ref>|group= n}} He wrote no fewer than eight piano sonatas: No. 1, Op. 1 (1898); No. 2 in D Minor (1900); No. 3 (published as No. 1, 1910); No. 4 in F-sharp Minor (publ. as No. 2, also 1910); No. 5 in E-flat Major (1921, transformed into Symphony No. 1); No. 6 (publ. as No. 3, 1926); No. 7 (publ. as No. 4, 1932); and No. 8 in B-flat Major, \u201cSalzburg\u201d (1937, not published). The four published sonatas are, in Palmer's view, as central to the composer's piano music as the symphonies are to the orchestral output.<ref name=cp1>Palmer, Christopher (1987). Notes to Chandos CD 8496, {{OCLC|602371238}}</ref> The first two sonatas are each in a single movement, of about twenty minutes; the third and fourth are in conventional three-movement form.<ref name=cp2/><ref name=cp1/> The First Symphony was originally planned as a large-scale piano sonata in E{{music|flat}} (1921); the manuscript score of the latter came to light in the early 1980s and was performed for the first time in 1983.<ref>Foreman, Lewis (1994). Notes to Continuum CD CCD 1045 DDD, {{OCLC|223356733}}</ref> Bax's own virtuosity as a pianist is reflected in the demands of many of his piano pieces. Palmer cites [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] as major influences on Bax's piano style as well as Balakirev and the other Russians whose influence is seen throughout the composer's work.<ref name=cp2/> For piano duo Bax composed two tone poems, ''Moy Mell'' (1917) and ''Red Autumn'' (1931).<ref name=cp1/> His shorter piano pieces include picturesque miniatures such as ''In a Vodka Shop'' (1915), ''A Hill Tune'' (1920) and ''Water Music'' (1929).<ref name=cp2/>\n\n==Neglect and revival==\nIn his later years Bax's music fell into neglect. [[John Barbirolli|Sir John Barbirolli]] wrote, \"I think he felt keenly that his richly wrought and masterly scores were no longer 'fashionable' to-day, but nothing could deter him from the path of complete honesty and sincerity in his musical thought.\"<ref name=cardus/> The neglect became more complete after the composer's death. He had always sustained a [[Romanticism (music)|Romantic]] outlook, distancing himself from [[Modernism (music)|musical modernism]] and especially [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[serialism]], of which Bax wrote in 1951:\n{{quote|I believe that there is little probability that the twelve-note scale will ever produce anything more than morbid or entirely cerebral growths. It might deal successfully with neuroses of various kinds, but I cannot imagine it associated with any healthy and happy concept such as young love or the coming of spring.<ref>Amis ''et al'', p. 307</ref>|}}\n\nNeither Bax's views nor his works were fashionable in the two decades after his death. The critic [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] writes that the mid-1950s were a time of \"immense change and transition in influential musical circles.\"<ref name=k200>Kennedy, p. 200</ref> The music favoured by the cultural establishment until then was regarded as having made Britain musically parochial and indifferent to the developments of the past half-century. In Kennedy's words, \"[[Edmund Rubbra|Rubbra]], Bax and [[John Ireland (composer)|Ireland]] found themselves out in the cold\".<ref name=k200/>\n\nForeman comments that in the years after Bax's death his reputation was kept alive by a single work&nbsp;\u2013 ''Tintagel''. Kennedy estimates that it took \"twenty painful years\" before the music of the British romantics including Bax made headway against the dominance of modernism.<ref name=k200/> Foreman dates the revival of Bax's music to Handley's performances of the Fourth Symphony and other works with the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1960s, and the pioneering recordings by [[Lyrita|Lyrita Recorded Edition]] of five of the symphonies.{{refn|The First and Second were conducted by [[Myer Fredman]] (1970), the Fifth by [[Raymond Leppard]] (1971), the Sixth by [[Norman Del Mar]] (1966) and the Seventh by Leppard (1974).<ref name=d>Stuart, Philip.

Inlow Hall.jpg|thumb|Lawrence W. Inlow Hall]]\nThe Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law traces its origins to the late nineteenth century when the first of its private predecessor schools, the '''Indiana Law School''', began operating in 1894. A full-time day school, the Indiana Law School was part of a newly formed University of Indianapolis that also included Butler University, the Medical College of Indiana and the Indiana Dental School. All three professional schools later became part of Indiana University. Among the first trustees of the school were former United States President, [[Benjamin Harrison]], and Indiana industrialist, [[Eli Lilly]].\n\nIn 1898, a second predecessor school, the '''Indianapolis College of Law''', was founded, offering a two-year evening program. This school, located in the Pythian Building in downtown Indianapolis, was advertised in 1906 as \"known everywhere for its successful graduates,\" and boasted a tuition of $10 per term. A few years later, another evening school, the '''American Central Law School''', was established. In 1914, the Indianapolis College of Law and American Central Law School merged to become the '''Benjamin Harrison Law School''', which was also an evening school. In 1936 the Benjamin Harrison Law School and the Indiana Law School merged, taking the name of the latter, and offering both day and evening programs.\n\nIn 1944, the Indiana Law School affiliated with [[Indiana University]], becoming the Indianapolis Division of the Indiana University School of Law. Beginning the following year, the school was housed in the [[Maennerchor Hall|Maennerchor Building]], an architectural landmark in Indianapolis. The school gained autonomy in 1968, becoming the '''Indiana University School of Law \u2013 Indianapolis''', the largest law school in the state of Indiana and the only law school in the state to offer both full- and part-time programs. The school moved into a new building at 735 West New York Street in 1970 where it remained until moving to Lawrence W. Inlow Hall, located at 530 West New York Street, in May 2001.<ref name=\"Law School Info\">Law School About Page | http://indylaw.indiana.edu/admissions/about.htm | accessdate=2011-02-16</ref>\n\nThe school's name was changed in December 2011 in recognition of a $24 million gift from Robert H.

Inlow Hall.jpg|thumb|Lawrence W. Inlow Hall]]\nThe Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law traces its origins to the late nineteenth century when the first of its private predecessor schools, the '''Indiana Law School''', began operating in 1894. A full-time day school, the Indiana Law School was part of a newly formed University of Indianapolis that also included Butler University, the Medical College of Indiana and the Indiana Dental School. All three professional schools later became part of Indiana University. Among the first trustees of the school were former United States President, [[Benjamin Harrison]], and Indiana industrialist, [[Eli Lilly]].\n\nIn 1898, a second predecessor school, the '''Indianapolis College of Law''', was founded, offering a two-year evening program. This school, located in the Pythian Building in downtown Indianapolis, was advertised in 1906 as \"known everywhere for its successful graduates,\" and boasted a tuition of $10 per term. A few years later, another evening school, the '''American Central Law School''', was established. In 1914, the Indianapolis College of Law and American Central Law School merged to become the '''Benjamin Harrison Law School''', which was also an evening school. In 1936 the Benjamin Harrison Law School and the Indiana Law School merged, taking the name of the latter, and offering both day and evening programs.\n\nIn 1944, the Indiana Law School affiliated with [[Indiana University]], becoming the Indianapolis Division of the Indiana University School of Law. Beginning the following year, the school was housed in the [[Maennerchor Hall|Maennerchor Building]], an architectural landmark in Indianapolis. The school gained autonomy in 1968, becoming the '''Indiana University School of Law \u2013 Indianapolis''', the largest law school in the state of Indiana and the only law school in the state to offer both full- and part-time programs. The school moved into a new building at 735 West New York Street in 1970 where it remained until moving to Lawrence W. Inlow Hall, located at 530 West New York Street, in May 2001.<ref name=\"Law School Info\">Law School About Page | http://indylaw.indiana.edu/admissions/about.htm | accessdate=2011-02-16</ref>\n\nThe school's name was changed in December 2011 in recognition of a $24 million gift from Robert H. McKinney, who previously served as chairman and CEO of First Indiana Corporation and is among the founders of Bose McKinney & Evans LLP, one of the largest law firms in Indianapolis.<ref name=\"Law School Headlines\">Law School Headlines | http://indylaw.indiana.edu/news/current.cfm?nid=567 | accessdate=2011-12-01</ref> The gift was the largest in school history and was part of an arrangement to match funds with an IUPUI fundraising campaign, for a total value of $31.5 million.<ref>Scott Olson, \"[http://www.ibj.com/iu-law-school-in-indianapolis-gets-24m-from-mckinney/PARAMS/article/31085 IU law school in Indianapolis gets $24M from McKinney]\" (December 1, 2011).

For this reason, it may be as helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]]. For more, see [[#Licensing and Types of OER|Licensing and Types of OER]] later in this article.\n\nThere is also a tension between entities which find value in quantifying usage of OER and those which see such [[Performance metric|metrics]] as themselves being irrelevant to free and open resources. Those requiring metrics associated with OER are often those with economic investment in the technologies needed to access or provide electronic OER, those with economic interests potentially threatened by OER,<ref>{{cite book|last=(CERI)|first=Center for Educational Research and Innovation|title=Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|year=2007|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)|location=Executive Summary (Policy implications and recommendations)|isbn=978-92-64-03174-6|page=15|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf}}</ref> or those requiring justification for the costs of implementing and maintaining the infrastructure or access to the freely available OER.

Many educational resources made available on the Internet are geared to allowing online access to digitised educational content, but the materials themselves are restrictively licensed.  Thus, they are not OER.  Often, this is not intentional.  Most educators are not familiar with copyright law in their own jurisdictions, never mind internationally.  International law and national laws of nearly all nations, and certainly of those who have signed onto the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), restrict all content under strict copyright (unless the copyright owner specifically releases it under an open license).

Currently, more than 60 students are listed as its members.\n\n== Open Educational Practices ==\nOER have been used in educational contexts in a variety of ways, and researchers and practitioners have proposed different names for such practices. According to Wiley & Hilton (2018),<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> the two popular terms used are \"open pedagogy\" and \"open educational practices\". What these two terms refer to is closely related to each other, often indistinguishable. For example, Weller (2013) defines open pedagogy as follows: \"Open pedagogy makes use of this abundant, open content (such as open educational resources, videos, podcasts), but also places an emphasis on the network and the learner's connections within this\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5334/2013-15|title = The Battle for Open - a perspective|journal = Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume = 2013|issue = 3|pages = 15|year = 2013|last1 = Weller|first1 = Martin|doi-access = free}}</ref> Open educational practices are defined as, for example, \u201ca set of activities around instructional design and implementation of events and processes intended to support learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual setting. (The Open Educational Quality Initiative<ref>https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-25907/OPALReport2011_Beyond_OER.pdf</ref>). Wiley & Hilton (2018)<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> proposed a new term called \"OER-enabled pedagogy\", which is defined as \"the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER\", emphasizing the 5R permissions enabled by the use of open licenses.\n\n== Costs ==\nOne of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.<ref>Bliss, T.

Retrieved from http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1153</ref> While OER seem well placed to bring down total expenditures, they are not cost-free. New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency. Upfront costs in developing the OER infrastructure can be expensive, such as building the OER infrastructure. Butcher and Hoosen<ref>Butcher, N., & Hoosen, S. (2012).

Retrieved from http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=421</ref> noted that \u201ca key argument put forward by those who have written about the potential benefits of OER relates to its potential for saving cost or, at least, creating significant economic efficiencies.

For this reason, it may be as helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]]. For more, see [[#Licensing and Types of OER|Licensing and Types of OER]] later in this article.\n\nThere is also a tension between entities which find value in quantifying usage of OER and those which see such [[Performance metric|metrics]] as themselves being irrelevant to free and open resources. Those requiring metrics associated with OER are often those with economic investment in the technologies needed to access or provide electronic OER, those with economic interests potentially threatened by OER,<ref>{{cite book|last=(CERI)|first=Center for Educational Research and Innovation|title=Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|year=2007|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)|location=Executive Summary (Policy implications and recommendations)|isbn=978-92-64-03174-6|page=15|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf}}</ref> or those requiring justification for the costs of implementing and maintaining the infrastructure or access to the freely available OER.

Many educational resources made available on the Internet are geared to allowing online access to digitised educational content, but the materials themselves are restrictively licensed.  Thus, they are not OER.  Often, this is not intentional.  Most educators are not familiar with copyright law in their own jurisdictions, never mind internationally.  International law and national laws of nearly all nations, and certainly of those who have signed onto the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), restrict all content under strict copyright (unless the copyright owner specifically releases it under an open license).

Few studies have investigated the usage of OER, so it is still not very clear how faculty and student use of OER (enabled by the permission given by an open license) would contribute to student learning.<ref name=\"openedgroup.org\"/> For example, research from the Czech Republic has proved most students said they use OER as often as or more often than classical materials.

Currently, more than 60 students are listed as its members.\n\n== Open Educational Practices ==\nOER have been used in educational contexts in a variety of ways, and researchers and practitioners have proposed different names for such practices. According to Wiley & Hilton (2018),<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> the two popular terms used are \"open pedagogy\" and \"open educational practices\". What these two terms refer to is closely related to each other, often indistinguishable. For example, Weller (2013) defines open pedagogy as follows: \"Open pedagogy makes use of this abundant, open content (such as open educational resources, videos, podcasts), but also places an emphasis on the network and the learner's connections within this\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5334/2013-15|title = The Battle for Open - a perspective|journal = Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume = 2013|issue = 3|pages = 15|year = 2013|last1 = Weller|first1 = Martin|doi-access = free}}</ref> Open educational practices are defined as, for example, \u201ca set of activities around instructional design and implementation of events and processes intended to support learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual setting. (The Open Educational Quality Initiative<ref>https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-25907/OPALReport2011_Beyond_OER.pdf</ref>). Wiley & Hilton (2018)<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> proposed a new term called \"OER-enabled pedagogy\", which is defined as \"the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER\", emphasizing the 5R permissions enabled by the use of open licenses.\n\n== Costs ==\nOne of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.<ref>Bliss, T.

Retrieved from http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1153</ref> While OER seem well placed to bring down total expenditures, they are not cost-free. New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency. Upfront costs in developing the OER infrastructure can be expensive, such as building the OER infrastructure. Butcher and Hoosen<ref>Butcher, N., & Hoosen, S. (2012).

Retrieved from http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=421</ref> noted that \u201ca key argument put forward by those who have written about the potential benefits of OER relates to its potential for saving cost or, at least, creating significant economic efficiencies.

She imagines that characters Beast and Hamilton Hocks are her friends.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Maggie and the Ferocious Beast episodes}}\n{{:List of Maggie and the Ferocious Beast episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Maggie (voiced by Kristen Bone) is a five-year-old girl (who later turns six years old)  and the human protagonist of the show. She is Hamilton's and Beast's best friend. They both look up to Maggie very much and always turn to her for advice. Maggie is the leader of the group and is always there to be the compassionate voice of reason to her dear friends.\n* The Ferocious Beast (voiced by [[Stephen Ouimette]]) he is very scary or ferocious. However, he can shout louder than anybody. He is a yellow beast, with big red removable spots, and three horns on his head. His favorite catchphrase is \"Great googly moogly!\", which he says several times per episode. In \"Hide And Go Beast\", it is shown that he is allergic to pollen. He is just a big softie, despite his bold appearance. Beast loves pumpkins, which is convenient since there is an impressive pumpkin patch in Nowhere Land. As a matter of fact, Beast loves pretty much any kind of food, including Hamilton's cooking, and is almost always hungry. He even loves baths. Maggie and Hamilton are his best friends. He wears multi-colored galoshes which he pronounces as \"Goo-lashes\". Hamilton always corrects him about the pronunciation, but he does not believe him.\n* Hamilton Hocks (voiced by Michael Caruana) is a pig who can be bossy and quite fussy, but he has a warm heart. He lives inside a portable cardboard box which he loves, is the best cook in Nowhere Land, and is a total clean freak. Hamilton's most prized possessions are his beautiful \"H\" sweater and his cardboard box, which also happens to be his home. Maggie and the Beast are his best friends.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Rudy the Mouse: Rudy is a cheese-loving mouse who lives in a large wheel of cheese in a part of Nowhere Land called Cheese Town. It is revealed in one episode that Rudy's hat and boots do not come off because they are glued to him. Strangely enough, this character started off with the name Pippy but was renamed by the writers soon after.\n* Nedley the Rabbit: Nedley speaks in rhymes. He says rhymes almost all through every episode that he appears in, but sometimes he talks normally a little bit before starting his rhyme again. Nedley lives in a rabbit hole next to his carrot patch in Nowhere Land.\n* The Moo Sisters: They are the three cows who live in a part of Nowhere Land called Mooville. They love to sing and do it often. They are sisters and their names are Millicent, Mavis and Marge.\n* Mr. Moon: He is the only non-human and non-animal character in the episode \"Blue Moon\". He is usually grumpy because people say he is made of green cheese.\n* The Kindly Giant: The Kindly Giant is not at all scary but instead kind hearted. The others are scared at first but they soon get used to him and they sometimes go to him for advice or a favour. He refers to Maggie, Hamilton and the Beast as little ones. He owns a garden full of fruits and vegetables, from which he always lets the ever hungry Beast scarf up a giant blueberry or two. His face is never shown, and he only appears in a few episodes. He is big and strong. Even the Beast seems small compared to the giant. The Kindly Giant lives in an area of Nowhere Land where all the fruits and vegetables are giant sized. Usually, only his shoes and ankles are seen due to his largeness.\n* The Dream Sheep: White sheep that make \"baa\" sounds. They are occasionally up in the clouds.\n* The Jellybean Team: They are a group of seven jellybeans. There is a red one, an orange one, a yellow one, a purple one, a black one and two green ones. They are small, of course, but have big personalities. They also tend to argue with each other a lot because they each think they are more important than the others.\n* The Triplets: Maggie's baby cousins (Zack, Max, and Oscar). They only appear in four episodes, \"One, Two, Three\", \"Home of the Kindly Giant\", \"The New Rubber Ball\" and \"Which Way Did They Go?\".\n* Big Duck: A large duck with white feathers who lives in the water. She is the focus of the episode \"The Big Duck\" and appears in the series' theme song.\n* Reggie Van Beast: Beast's cousin. His coloring is the inverse of Beast's, being red with yellow spots, and he wears a monocle. He is rather stuck up and rude, and never really seems to enjoy anything that Beast and his friends want to do. He also often speaks in rhymes, similar to Nedley. He first appeared in \"Guess Who's Coming to Visit\".\n\n==Production==\nThe theme song for the show is \"Maggie and the Ferocious Beast in Nowhere Land,\" which is an original song by [[Isabella Molley]]. ''Maggie and the Ferocious Beast'' is produced by [[Nelvana]], and directed by [[Jamie Whitney]] and [[Stuart Shankly]]. The series debuted in 2000 and the series aired its last episode in 2002. The show is distributed by Nelvana. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, the show was dubbed with British voice actors, replacing the original Canadian soundtrack. The shorts were shown with the original voices.\n\n==Broadcast==\nIn Canada, ''Maggie and the Ferocious Beast'' aired on [[Teletoon]] and [[Treehouse TV]]. In the United States, it aired on [[Nickelodeon]] as part of its [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr.]] block from June 5, 2000, to September 6, 2004, and the American children's channel [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] (now [[Nick Jr.]]) from April 7, 2003, until September 27, 2009, when Noggin was re-branded as Nick Jr., and continued to air reruns until October 30, 2010.

He is rather stuck up and rude, and never really seems to enjoy anything that Beast and his friends want to do. He also often speaks in rhymes, similar to Nedley. He first appeared in \"Guess Who's Coming to Visit\".\n\n==Production==\nThe theme song for the show is \"Maggie and the Ferocious Beast in Nowhere Land,\" which is an original song by [[Isabella Molley]]. ''Maggie and the Ferocious Beast'' is produced by [[Nelvana]], and directed by [[Jamie Whitney]] and [[Stuart Shankly]]. The series debuted in 2000 and the series aired its last episode in 2002. The show is distributed by Nelvana. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, the show was dubbed with British voice actors, replacing the original Canadian soundtrack. The shorts were shown with the original voices.\n\n==Broadcast==\nIn Canada, ''Maggie and the Ferocious Beast'' aired on [[Teletoon]] and [[Treehouse TV]]. In the United States, it aired on [[Nickelodeon]] as part of its [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr.]] block from June 5, 2000 to September 6, 2004, and the American children's channel [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] (now [[Nick Jr.]]) from April 7, 2003 until September 27, 2009 when Noggin was re-branded as Nick Jr., and continued to air reruns until October 30, 2010. The show aired in reruns on \"[[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS]]\" from September 16, 2000, to June 9, 2001.

The British North American provinces, for reasons of practicality in relation to the increasing trade with the neighbouring United States, had a desire to assimilate their currencies with the American unit, but the imperial authorities in London still preferred sterling as the sole currency throughout the [[British Empire]]. The British North American provinces nonetheless gradually adopted currencies tied to the American dollar.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Currencies used in Canada and its predecessors\n|-\n!Currency!!Dates in use!!Value in [[British pound]]s!!Value in Canadian dollars\n|-\n||[[Canadian pound]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1841\u20131858|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|16s 5.3d|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|$4\n|-\n|Canadian dollar|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1858\u2013present|| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|4s 1.3d|| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$1\n|-\n|New Brunswick dollar|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1860\u20131867\n|-\n|[[British Columbia dollar]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1865\u20131871 syrup is like maple\n\n|-\n|[[Prince Edward Island dollar]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1871\u20131873\n|-\n|[[Nova Scotian dollar]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1860\u20131871|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4s|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|$0.973\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Newfoundland dollar]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1865\u20131895|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4s 2d|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|$1.014\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||1895\u20131949|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4s 1.3d|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|$1\n|}\n\n===Province of Canada===\n\nIn 1841, the [[Province of Canada]] adopted a new system based on the [[Halifax rating]]. The new [[Canadian pound]] was equal to four US dollars (92.88 [[grain (mass)|grains]] gold), making one [[pound sterling]] equal to 1 pound, 4 shillings, and 4 pence Canadian. Thus, the new Canadian pound was worth 16 shillings and 5.3 pence sterling.\n\nIn 1851, the [[Parliament of the Province of Canada]] passed an act for the purposes of introducing a pound sterling unit in conjunction with decimal fractional coinage. The idea was that the decimal coins would correspond to exact amounts in relation to the U.S. dollar fractional coinage.\n\nIn response to British concerns, in 1853, an act of the Parliament of the Province of Canada introduced the [[gold standard]] into the colony, based on both the British [[gold sovereign]] and the [[Eagle (United States coin)|American gold eagle coins]]. This gold standard was introduced with the gold sovereign being [[legal tender]] at \u00a31 = US${{frac|4.86|2|3}}. No coinage was provided for under the 1853 act. Sterling coinage was made legal tender and all other silver coins were demonetized. The British government in principle allowed for a decimal coinage but nevertheless held out the hope that a sterling unit would be chosen under the name of \"royal\". However, in 1857, the decision was made to introduce a decimal coinage into the Province of Canada in conjunction with the U.S. dollar unit. Hence, when the new decimal coins were introduced in 1858, the colony's currency became aligned with the U.S. currency, although the British gold sovereign continued to remain legal tender at the rate of \u00a31 = {{frac|4.86|2|3}} right up until the 1990s. In 1859, Canadian colonial postage stamps were issued with decimal denominations for the first time. In 1861, Canadian postage stamps were issued with the denominations shown in dollars and cents.\n\n===New Brunswick and Nova Scotia===\nIn 1860, the colonies of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] followed the Province of Canada in adopting a decimal system based on the U.S. dollar unit.\n\n===Newfoundland===\n[[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] went decimal in 1865, but unlike the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, it decided to adopt a unit based on the [[Spanish dollar]] rather than on the U.S. dollar, and there was a slight difference between these two units. The U.S. dollar was created in 1792 on the basis of the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. As such, the Spanish dollar was worth slightly more than the U.S. dollar, and likewise, the [[Newfoundland dollar]], until 1895, was worth slightly more than the Canadian dollar.\n\n===British Columbia===\nThe [[Colony of British Columbia (1858\u20131866)|Colony of British Columbia]] adopted the [[British Columbia dollar]] as its currency in 1865, at par with the Canadian dollar. When British Columbia joined Confederation in 1871, the Canadian dollar replaced the British Columbia dollar.\n\n===Prince Edward Island===\nIn 1871, [[Prince Edward Island]] went decimal within the U.S. dollar unit and introduced coins for 1\u00a2. However, the currency of Prince Edward Island was absorbed into the Canadian system shortly afterwards, when Prince Edward Island joined the Dominion of Canada in 1873.\n\n===Confederation===\nIn 1867, the provinces of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia united in a federation named [[Canada]] and the three currencies were merged into the Canadian dollar. The Canadian Parliament passed the ''Uniform Currency Act'' in April 1871,<ref name=\"UCA\">{{cite web |url=http://canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/1871Uniform_Currency_Act.html |title=1871&nbsp;\u2013 Uniform Currency Act |publisher=Canadian Economy Online, [[Government of Canada]] |accessdate=February 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221100047/http://canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/1871Uniform_Currency_Act.html |archivedate=February 21, 2008}}</ref> tying up loose ends as to the currencies of the various provinces and replacing them with a common Canadian dollar.\n\n===Evolution in the 20th century===\nThe [[gold standard]] was temporarily abandoned during the [[World War I|First World War]] and definitively abolished on April 10, 1933. At the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the exchange rate to the U.S. dollar was fixed at C$1.10 = US$1.00. This was changed to parity in 1946. In 1949, sterling was devalued and Canada followed, returning to a peg of C$1.10 = US$1.00. However, Canada allowed its dollar to float in 1950, whereupon the currency rose to a slight premium over the U.S. dollar for the next decade. But the Canadian dollar fell sharply after 1960 before it was again pegged in 1962 at C$1.00 = US$0.925. This was sometimes pejoratively referred to as the \"Diefenbuck\" or the \"Diefendollar\", after the then Prime Minister, [[Diefenbaker|John Diefenbaker]]. This peg lasted until 1970, with the currency's value being floated since then.\n\n==Terminology==\n\n[[Canadian English]], like [[American English]], used the slang term \"[[Dollar|buck]]\" for a former paper dollar. The Canadian origin of this term derives from a coin struck by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] during the 17th century with a value equal to the [[fur|pelt]] of a male [[beaver]]&nbsp;\u2013 a \"buck\".<ref name=\"buck\">{{cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/official-symbols-canada.html#a1 |title=Official symbols of Canada - Canada.ca |first=Canadian |last=Heritage |website=www.canada.ca}}</ref> Because of the appearance of the [[common loon]] on the back of the $1 coin that replaced the dollar bill in 1987, the word \"loonie\" was adopted in Canadian parlance to distinguish the Canadian dollar coin from the dollar bill. When the two-dollar coin was introduced in 1996, the derivative word \"[[toonie]]\" (\"two loonies\") became the common word for it in Canadian English slang.\n\nIn [[French language|French]], the currency is also called {{lang|fr|le dollar}}; [[Canadian French]] slang terms include {{lang|fr|[[piastre]]}} or {{lang|fr|piasse}} (the original word used in 18th-century French to translate \"dollar\") and {{lang|fr|huard}} (equivalent to \"loonie\", since {{lang|fr|huard}} is French for \"loon,\" the bird appearing on the coin). The French pronunciation of {{lang|fr|cent}} (pronounced similarly to English as {{IPA|/s\u025bnt/}} or {{IPA|/s\u025bn/}}, not like the word for hundred, {{IPA|/s\u0251\u0303/}} or {{IPA|/s\u00e3/}})<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guilloton |first1=No\u00eblle |last2=Cajolet-Lagani\u00e8re |first2=H\u00e9l\u00e8ne |title=Le fran\u00e7ais au bureau |publisher=Les publications du Qu\u00e9bec |year=2005 |page=467 |isbn=2-551-19684-1}}</ref> is generally used for the subdivision; {{lang|fr|sou}} is another, informal, term for 1\u00a2. [[Quarter (Canadian coin)|25\u00a2 coins]] in Quebec French are often called {{lang|fr|trente sous}} (\"thirty cents\") because of a series of changes in terminology, currencies, and exchange rates. After the British conquest of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] in 1760, French coins gradually went out of use, and {{lang|fr|sou}} became a nickname for the [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], which was similar in value to the [[Solidus (coin)#France|French ''sou'']]. Spanish dollars and U.S. dollars were also in use, and from 1841 to 1858, the exchange rate was fixed at $4 = \u00a31 (or 400\u00a2 = 240d). This made 25\u00a2 equal to 15d, or 30 halfpence ({{lang|fr|trente sous}}). After decimalization and the withdrawal of halfpence coins, the nickname {{lang|fr|sou}} began to be used for the [[Penny (Canadian coin)|1\u00a2 coin]], but the idiom {{lang|fr|trente sous}} for 25\u00a2 endured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fredak.com/dico/dico_trentesous.htm |title=Pourquoi trente sous = 25 cents ? |first=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric |last=Farid |date=September 26, 2008 |access-date=October 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Coins==\n{{Main|Coins of the Canadian dollar}}\n\n[[File:Canadian 1 and 2 dollar coins.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The one- and two-dollar coins, nicknamed the ''loonie'' and ''toonie'']]\n\nCoins are produced by the [[Royal Canadian Mint]]'s facilities in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], in denominations of 5\u00a2 ([[nickel (Canadian coin)|nickel]]), 10\u00a2 ([[dime (Canadian coin)|dime]]), 25\u00a2 ([[quarter (Canadian coin)|quarter]]), 50\u00a2 ([[50-cent piece (Canadian coin)|50\u00a2 piece]]) (though the 50\u00a2 piece is no longer distributed to banks and is only available directly from the mint, therefore seeing very little circulation), $1 ([[loonie]]), and $2 ([[toonie]]).

Some pennies, nickels, and dimes remain in circulation that bear the effigy of [[George VI]]. It is also common for [[American dollar|American coins]] to be found among circulation due to the close proximity to the United States and the fact that the sizes of the coins are similar. Commemorative coins with differing reverses are also issued on an irregular basis, most often quarters. 50\u00a2 coins are rarely found in circulation; they are often collected and not regularly used in day-to-day transactions in most provinces.\n\n===Coin history===\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn 1858, bronze 1\u00a2 and 0.925 silver 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2 and 20\u00a2 coins were issued by the Province of Canada. Except for 1\u00a2 coins struck in 1859, no more coins were issued until 1870, when production of the 5\u00a2 and 10\u00a2 was resumed and silver 25\u00a2 and 50\u00a2 were introduced. Between 1908 and 1919, [[gold sovereign|sovereigns]] (legal tender in Canada for ${{frac|4.86|2|3}}) were struck in Ottawa with a \"C\" mintmark.\n\n[[File:1914 Canadian $5 gold reverse.jpg|thumb|right|$5 gold Canadian coin from 1914.

It has a diameter of 21.59&nbsp;mm and a thickness of 1.82&nbsp;mm at the rim.]]\n\nCanada produced its first gold dollar coins in 1912 in the form of $5 and $10. These coins were produced from 1912 to 1914. The obverse carries an image of [[King George V]] and on the reverse is a shield with the arms of the Dominion of Canada. Gold from the [[Klondike River]] valley in the [[Yukon]] accounts for much of the gold in the coins.\n\nTwo years into the coin's production World War I began and production of the coins stopped in favour of tighter control over Canadian gold reserves. Most of the 1914 coins produced never reached circulation at the time and some were stored for more than 75 years until being sold off in 2012. The high quality specimens were sold to the public and the visually unappealing ones were melted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mint.ca/store/news/a-national-treasure-resurfaces-as-theroyal-canadian-mint-offers-rare-opportunity-to-own-canadas-first-gold-coins-crafted-with-pridefrom-19121914-17400003?cat=News+releases&nId=700002&parentnId=600004&nodeGroup=About+the+Mint |title=A National Treasure Resurfaces as the Royal Canadian Mint Offers Rare Opportunity to Own Canada's First Gold Coins, Crafted With Pride From 1912-1914 |website=www.mint.ca}}</ref>\n\nIn 1920, the size of the 1\u00a2 was reduced and the silver fineness of the 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, 25\u00a2 and 50\u00a2 coins was reduced to 0.800 silver/.200 copper. This composition was maintained for the 10\u00a2, 25\u00a2 and 50\u00a2 piece through 1966, but the debasement of the 5\u00a2 piece continued in 1922 with the silver 5\u00a2 being entirely replaced by a larger nickel coin. In 1942, as a wartime measure, nickel was replaced by [[tombac]] in the 5\u00a2 coin, which was changed in shape from round to [[dodecagonal]]. Chromium-plated steel was used for the 5\u00a2 in 1944 and 1945 and between 1951 and 1954, after which nickel was readopted. The 5\u00a2 returned to a round shape in 1963.\n\nIn 1935, the 0.800 silver [[voyageur dollar]] was introduced. Production was maintained through 1967 with the exception of the war years between 1939 and 1945.\n\nIn 1967 both 0.800 silver/0.200 copper and, later that year, 0.500 silver/.500 copper 10\u00a2 and 25\u00a2 coins were issued. 1968 saw further debasement: the 0.500 fine silver dimes and quarters were completely replaced by nickel ones mid-year. All 1968 50\u00a2 and $1 coins were reduced in size and coined only in pure nickel. Thus, 1968 marked the last year in which any circulating silver coinage was issued in Canada.\n\nIn 1982, the 1\u00a2 coin was changed to dodecagonal, and the 5\u00a2 was further debased to a cupro-nickel alloy. In 1987 a $1 coin struck in aureate-plated nickel was introduced. A [[Bimetallic coins|bimetallic]] $2 coin followed in 1996. In 1997, copper-plated zinc replaced bronze in the 1\u00a2, and it returned to a round shape. This was followed, in 2000, by the introduction of even cheaper plated-steel 1\u00a2, 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, 25\u00a2 and 50\u00a2 coins, with the 1\u00a2 plated in copper and the others plated in cupro-nickel. In 2012, the multi-ply plated-steel technology was introduced for $1 and $2 coins as well.

First note printed for the series.]]\n\nThe first paper money issued in Canada denominated in dollars were British Army bills, issued between 1813 and 1815. Canadian dollar banknotes were later issued by the [[Banking in Canada|chartered banks]] starting in the 1830s, by several pre-[[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] colonial governments (most notably the [[Province of Canada]] in 1866), and after confederation, by the Canadian government starting in 1870. Some municipalities also issued notes, most notably ''depression [[scrip]]'' during the 1930s.\n\nOn July 3, 1934,<ref>{{cite book |last=Linzmayer |first=Owen |title=The Banknote Book |chapter=Canada |website=www.BanknoteNews.com |year=2013 |location=San Francisco, CA |url=http://www.banknotebook.com}}</ref> with only 10 chartered banks still issuing notes, the [[Bank of Canada]] was founded. This new government agency became the sole issuer of all federal notes. It began issuing notes in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $25, $50, $100, $500 and $1000. In 1944, the chartered banks were prohibited from issuing their own currency, with the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] and the Bank of Montreal among the last to issue notes.\n\nSignificant design changes to the notes have occurred since 1935, with new series introduced in 1937, 1954, 1970, 1986, and 2001. In June 2011, newly designed notes printed on a [[Polymer banknote|polymer]] substrate, as opposed to cotton fibre, were announced; the first of these polymer notes, the $100 bill, began circulation on November 14, 2011, the $50 bill began circulation on March 26, 2012, the $20 denomination began circulation on November 7, 2012, and the $5 and $10 denominations began circulation on November 12, 2013.\n\nSince 1935, all banknotes are printed by the [[Ottawa]]-based [[Canadian Bank Note Company]] under contract to the Bank of Canada. Previously, a second company, BA International (founded in 1866 as the British American Bank Note Company), shared printing duties. In 2011, BA International announced it would close its banknote printing business and cease printing banknotes at the end of 2012;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.printaction.com/News/2011121-g-d-banknote.html |title=G&D to Shutter Banknote Printing in Ottawa |publisher=PrintAction |date=December 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}</ref> since then, the Canadian Bank Note Company has been the sole printer of Canadian banknotes.\n\nAll banknotes from series prior to the current polymer series are now considered unfit for circulation due to their lacking of any modern security features, such as a metallic stripe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/unfit_notes_poster.pdf |title=Unfit Bank Notes |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=October 2012 |website=bankofcanada.ca |publisher=Bank of Canada |access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> Financial institutions must return the banknotes to the Bank of Canada, which will destroy them.{{sfn|Bank of Canada: Unfit Bank Notes}} Individuals may keep the banknotes indefinitely.{{sfn|CBC News|2000}}\n\n==Legal tender==\nCanadian dollar banknotes issued by the Bank of Canada are [[legal tender]] in Canada.

According to legal guidelines, the method of payment has to be mutually agreed upon by the parties involved with the transactions. For example, stores may refuse $100 banknotes if they feel that would put them at risk of being [[counterfeit]] victims; however, official policy suggests that the retailers should evaluate the impact of that approach. In the case that no mutually acceptable form of payment can be found for the tender, the parties involved should seek legal advice.<ref name=\"counterfeit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/scams/counterfaq_e.htm |title=Currency Counterfeiting&nbsp;\u2013 FAQ |publisher=[[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215102641/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/scams/counterfaq_e.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=February 15, 2008}}</ref>\n\nCanadian dollars, especially coins, are accepted by some businesses in the northernmost cities of the United States and in many Canadian [[snowbird (people)|snowbird]] enclaves, just as U.S. dollars are accepted by some Canadian businesses.<ref>{{cite news |title=6 US Destinations That Will Accept Canadian Money Without Converting It |url=https://www.narcity.com/ca/on/toronto/travel/8-us-destinations-that-will-accept-canadian-money-without-converting-it |accessdate=Feb 11, 2019 |publisher=NARCITY |date=Mar 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, [[Iceland]] considered adopting the Canadian dollar as a stable alternative to the [[Icelandic kr\u00f3na]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/iceland-eyes-loonie-canada-ready-to-talk/article2356634/ |title=Canadian envoy to Iceland sparks loonie controversy |first=Barrie |last=Mckenna |date=March 2, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |access-date=March 4, 2012 |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120304152551/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/iceland-eyes-loonie-canada-ready-to-talk/article2356634/ |archive-date = March 4, 2012 |url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/15/iceland-canadian-loonie/ |title=If Iceland adopts the loonie, Greenland could soon follow: economist |first=Tristin |last=Hopper |date=May 15, 2012 |newspaper=[[The National Post]] |access-date=May 15, 2012}}</ref>\nCanada was favoured due to its northern geography and similar resource based economy, in addition to its relative economic stability.<ref>{{cite news |last=McKenna |first=Barrie |title=Canadian envoy to Iceland sparks loonie controversy |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/iceland-eyes-loonie-canada-ready-to-talk/article2356634/ |access-date=March 3, 2012 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=March 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302181026/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/iceland-eyes-loonie-canada-ready-to-talk/article2356634/ |archive-date=March 2, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Canada ready to discuss letting Iceland use its dollar |url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2012/03/02/canada-ready-to-discuss-letting-iceland-use-its-dollar/ |publisher=icenews.is |access-date=March 8, 2012}}</ref> The Canadian ambassador to Iceland said that Iceland could adopt the currency; although Iceland ultimately decided not to move on with the proposal.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/top-business-stories/canadian-dollar-a-poor-choice-for-iceland-central-bank-says/article4564361/ |title=Canadian dollar a 'poor choice' for Iceland, central bank says |first=Michael |last=Babad |date=September 24, 2012 |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=November 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Value==\n[[File:CAD-USD v2.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The cost of one [[United States dollar]] in Canadian dollars from 1990]]\n[[File:CAD-EUR 1999-.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The cost of one [[Euro]] in Canadian dollars from 1999]]\n<!-- Editor, please don't change this page every time you hear about recent high or low.

The British North American provinces, for reasons of practicality in relation to the increasing trade with the neighbouring United States, had a desire to assimilate their currencies with the American unit, but the imperial authorities in London still preferred sterling as the sole currency throughout the [[British Empire]]. The British North American provinces nonetheless gradually adopted currencies tied to the American dollar.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Currencies used in Canada and its predecessors\n|-\n!Currency!!Dates in use!!Value in [[British pound]]s!!Value in Canadian dollars\n|-\n||[[Canadian pound]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1841\u20131858|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|16s 5.3d|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|$4\n|-\n|Canadian dollar|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1858\u2013present|| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|4s 1.3d|| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$1\n|-\n|New Brunswick dollar|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1860\u20131867\n|-\n|[[British Columbia dollar]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1865\u20131871\n|-\n|[[Prince Edward Island dollar]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1871\u20131873\n|-\n|[[Nova Scotian dollar]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1860\u20131871|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4s|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|$0.973\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Newfoundland dollar]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1865\u20131895|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4s 2d|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|$1.014\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||1895\u20131949|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4s 1.3d|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|$1\n|}\n\n===Province of Canada===\n\nIn 1841, the [[Province of Canada]] adopted a new system based on the [[Halifax rating]]. The new [[Canadian pound]] was equal to four US dollars (92.88 [[grain (mass)|grains]] gold), making one [[pound sterling]] equal to 1 pound, 4 shillings, and 4 pence Canadian. Thus, the new Canadian pound was worth 16 shillings and 5.3 pence sterling.\n\nIn 1851, the [[Parliament of the Province of Canada]] passed an act for the purposes of introducing a pound sterling unit in conjunction with decimal fractional coinage. The idea was that the decimal coins would correspond to exact amounts in relation to the U.S. dollar fractional coinage.\n\nIn response to British concerns, in 1853, an act of the Parliament of the Province of Canada introduced the [[gold standard]] into the colony, based on both the British [[gold sovereign]] and the [[Eagle (United States coin)|American gold eagle coins]]. This gold standard was introduced with the gold sovereign being [[legal tender]] at \u00a31 = US${{frac|4.86|2|3}}. No coinage was provided for under the 1853 act. Sterling coinage was made legal tender and all other silver coins were demonetized. The British government in principle allowed for a decimal coinage but nevertheless held out the hope that a sterling unit would be chosen under the name of \"royal\". However, in 1857, the decision was made to introduce a decimal coinage into the Province of Canada in conjunction with the U.S. dollar unit. Hence, when the new decimal coins were introduced in 1858, the colony's currency became aligned with the U.S. currency, although the British gold sovereign continued to remain legal tender at the rate of \u00a31 = {{frac|4.86|2|3}} right up until the 1990s. In 1859, Canadian colonial postage stamps were issued with decimal denominations for the first time. In 1861, Canadian postage stamps were issued with the denominations shown in dollars and cents.\n\n===New Brunswick and Nova Scotia===\nIn 1860, the colonies of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] followed the Province of Canada in adopting a decimal system based on the U.S. dollar unit.\n\n===Newfoundland===\n[[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] went decimal in 1865, but unlike the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, it decided to adopt a unit based on the [[Spanish dollar]] rather than on the U.S. dollar, and there was a slight difference between these two units. The U.S. dollar was created in 1792 on the basis of the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. As such, the Spanish dollar was worth slightly more than the U.S. dollar, and likewise, the [[Newfoundland dollar]], until 1895, was worth slightly more than the Canadian dollar.\n\n===British Columbia===\nThe [[Colony of British Columbia (1858\u20131866)|Colony of British Columbia]] adopted the [[British Columbia dollar]] as its currency in 1865, at par with the Canadian dollar. When British Columbia joined Confederation in 1871, the Canadian dollar replaced the British Columbia dollar.\n\n===Prince Edward Island===\nIn 1871, [[Prince Edward Island]] went decimal within the U.S. dollar unit and introduced coins for 1\u00a2. However, the currency of Prince Edward Island was absorbed into the Canadian system shortly afterwards, when Prince Edward Island joined the Dominion of Canada in 1873.\n\n===Confederation===\nIn 1867, the provinces of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia united in a federation named [[Canada]] and the three currencies were merged into the Canadian dollar. The Canadian Parliament passed the ''Uniform Currency Act'' in April 1871,<ref name=\"UCA\">{{cite web |url=http://canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/1871Uniform_Currency_Act.html |title=1871&nbsp;\u2013 Uniform Currency Act |publisher=Canadian Economy Online, [[Government of Canada]] |accessdate=February 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221100047/http://canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/1871Uniform_Currency_Act.html |archivedate=February 21, 2008}}</ref> tying up loose ends as to the currencies of the various provinces and replacing them with a common Canadian dollar.\n\n===Evolution in the 20th century===\nThe [[gold standard]] was temporarily abandoned during the [[World War I|First World War]] and definitively abolished on April 10, 1933. At the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the exchange rate to the U.S. dollar was fixed at C$1.10 = US$1.00. This was changed to parity in 1946. In 1949, sterling was devalued and Canada followed, returning to a peg of C$1.10 = US$1.00. However, Canada allowed its dollar to float in 1950, whereupon the currency rose to a slight premium over the U.S. dollar for the next decade. But the Canadian dollar fell sharply after 1960 before it was again pegged in 1962 at C$1.00 = US$0.925. This was sometimes pejoratively referred to as the \"Diefenbuck\" or the \"Diefendollar\", after the then Prime Minister, [[Diefenbaker|John Diefenbaker]]. This peg lasted until 1970, with the currency's value being floated since then.\n\n==Terminology==\n\n[[Canadian English]], like [[American English]], used the slang term \"[[Dollar|buck]]\" for a former paper dollar. The Canadian origin of this term derives from a coin struck by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] during the 17th century with a value equal to the [[fur|pelt]] of a male [[beaver]]&nbsp;\u2013 a \"buck\".<ref name=\"buck\">{{cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/official-symbols-canada.html#a1 |title=Official symbols of Canada - Canada.ca |first=Canadian |last=Heritage |website=www.canada.ca}}</ref> Because of the appearance of the [[common loon]] on the back of the $1 coin that replaced the dollar bill in 1987, the word \"loonie\" was adopted in Canadian parlance to distinguish the Canadian dollar coin from the dollar bill. When the two-dollar coin was introduced in 1996, the derivative word \"[[toonie]]\" (\"two loonies\") became the common word for it in Canadian English slang.\n\nIn [[French language|French]], the currency is also called {{lang|fr|le dollar}}; [[Canadian French]] slang terms include {{lang|fr|[[piastre]]}} or {{lang|fr|piasse}} (the original word used in 18th-century French to translate \"dollar\") and {{lang|fr|huard}} (equivalent to \"loonie\", since {{lang|fr|huard}} is French for \"loon,\" the bird appearing on the coin). The French pronunciation of {{lang|fr|cent}} (pronounced similarly to English as {{IPA|/s\u025bnt/}} or {{IPA|/s\u025bn/}}, not like the word for hundred, {{IPA|/s\u0251\u0303/}} or {{IPA|/s\u00e3/}})<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guilloton |first1=No\u00eblle |last2=Cajolet-Lagani\u00e8re |first2=H\u00e9l\u00e8ne |title=Le fran\u00e7ais au bureau |publisher=Les publications du Qu\u00e9bec |year=2005 |page=467 |isbn=2-551-19684-1}}</ref> is generally used for the subdivision; {{lang|fr|sou}} is another, informal, term for 1\u00a2. [[Quarter (Canadian coin)|25\u00a2 coins]] in Quebec French are often called {{lang|fr|trente sous}} (\"thirty cents\") because of a series of changes in terminology, currencies, and exchange rates. After the British conquest of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] in 1760, French coins gradually went out of use, and {{lang|fr|sou}} became a nickname for the [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], which was similar in value to the [[Solidus (coin)#France|French ''sou'']]. Spanish dollars and U.S. dollars were also in use, and from 1841 to 1858, the exchange rate was fixed at $4 = \u00a31 (or 400\u00a2 = 240d). This made 25\u00a2 equal to 15d, or 30 halfpence ({{lang|fr|trente sous}}). After decimalization and the withdrawal of halfpence coins, the nickname {{lang|fr|sou}} began to be used for the [[Penny (Canadian coin)|1\u00a2 coin]], but the idiom {{lang|fr|trente sous}} for 25\u00a2 endured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fredak.com/dico/dico_trentesous.htm |title=Pourquoi trente sous = 25 cents ? |first=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric |last=Farid |date=September 26, 2008 |access-date=October 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Coins==\n{{Main|Coins of the Canadian dollar}}\n\n[[File:Canadian 1 and 2 dollar coins.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The one- and two-dollar coins, nicknamed the ''loonie'' and ''toonie'']]\n\nCoins are produced by the [[Royal Canadian Mint]]'s facilities in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], in denominations of 5\u00a2 ([[nickel (Canadian coin)|nickel]]), 10\u00a2 ([[dime (Canadian coin)|dime]]), 25\u00a2 ([[quarter (Canadian coin)|quarter]]), 50\u00a2 ([[50-cent piece (Canadian coin)|50\u00a2 piece]]) (though the 50\u00a2 piece is no longer distributed to banks and is only available directly from the mint, therefore seeing very little circulation), $1 ([[loonie]]), and $2 ([[toonie]]).

Some pennies, nickels, and dimes remain in circulation that bear the effigy of [[George VI]]. It is also common for [[American dollar|American coins]] to be found among circulation due to the close proximity to the United States and the fact that the sizes of the coins are similar. Commemorative coins with differing reverses are also issued on an irregular basis, most often quarters. 50\u00a2 coins are rarely found in circulation; they are often collected and not regularly used in day-to-day transactions in most provinces.\n\n===Coin history===\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn 1858, bronze 1\u00a2 and 0.925 silver 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2 and 20\u00a2 coins were issued by the Province of Canada. Except for 1\u00a2 coins struck in 1859, no more coins were issued until 1870, when production of the 5\u00a2 and 10\u00a2 was resumed and silver 25\u00a2 and 50\u00a2 were introduced. Between 1908 and 1919, [[gold sovereign|sovereigns]] (legal tender in Canada for ${{frac|4.86|2|3}}) were struck in Ottawa with a \"C\" mintmark.\n\n[[File:1914 Canadian $5 gold reverse.jpg|thumb|right|$5 gold Canadian coin from 1914.

It has a diameter of 21.59&nbsp;mm and a thickness of 1.82&nbsp;mm at the rim.]]\n\nCanada produced its first gold dollar coins in 1912 in the form of $5 and $10. These coins were produced from 1912 to 1914. The obverse carries an image of [[King George V]] and on the reverse is a shield with the arms of the Dominion of Canada. Gold from the [[Klondike River]] valley in the [[Yukon]] accounts for much of the gold in the coins.\n\nTwo years into the coin's production World War I began and production of the coins stopped in favour of tighter control over Canadian gold reserves. Most of the 1914 coins produced never reached circulation at the time and some were stored for more than 75 years until being sold off in 2012. The high quality specimens were sold to the public and the visually unappealing ones were melted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mint.ca/store/news/a-national-treasure-resurfaces-as-theroyal-canadian-mint-offers-rare-opportunity-to-own-canadas-first-gold-coins-crafted-with-pridefrom-19121914-17400003?cat=News+releases&nId=700002&parentnId=600004&nodeGroup=About+the+Mint |title=A National Treasure Resurfaces as the Royal Canadian Mint Offers Rare Opportunity to Own Canada's First Gold Coins, Crafted With Pride From 1912-1914 |website=www.mint.ca}}</ref>\n\nIn 1920, the size of the 1\u00a2 was reduced and the silver fineness of the 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, 25\u00a2 and 50\u00a2 coins was reduced to 0.800 silver/.200 copper. This composition was maintained for the 10\u00a2, 25\u00a2 and 50\u00a2 piece through 1966, but the debasement of the 5\u00a2 piece continued in 1922 with the silver 5\u00a2 being entirely replaced by a larger nickel coin. In 1942, as a wartime measure, nickel was replaced by [[tombac]] in the 5\u00a2 coin, which was changed in shape from round to [[dodecagonal]]. Chromium-plated steel was used for the 5\u00a2 in 1944 and 1945 and between 1951 and 1954, after which nickel was readopted. The 5\u00a2 returned to a round shape in 1963.\n\nIn 1935, the 0.800 silver [[voyageur dollar]] was introduced. Production was maintained through 1967 with the exception of the war years between 1939 and 1945.\n\nIn 1967 both 0.800 silver/0.200 copper and, later that year, 0.500 silver/.500 copper 10\u00a2 and 25\u00a2 coins were issued. 1968 saw further debasement: the 0.500 fine silver dimes and quarters were completely replaced by nickel ones mid-year. All 1968 50\u00a2 and $1 coins were reduced in size and coined only in pure nickel. Thus, 1968 marked the last year in which any circulating silver coinage was issued in Canada.\n\nIn 1982, the 1\u00a2 coin was changed to dodecagonal, and the 5\u00a2 was further debased to a cupro-nickel alloy. In 1987 a $1 coin struck in aureate-plated nickel was introduced. A [[Bimetallic coins|bimetallic]] $2 coin followed in 1996. In 1997, copper-plated zinc replaced bronze in the 1\u00a2, and it returned to a round shape. This was followed, in 2000, by the introduction of even cheaper plated-steel 1\u00a2, 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, 25\u00a2 and 50\u00a2 coins, with the 1\u00a2 plated in copper and the others plated in cupro-nickel. In 2012, the multi-ply plated-steel technology was introduced for $1 and $2 coins as well. Also in that year mintage of the 1\u00a2 coin ceased and its withdrawal from circulation began in 2013.\n\n==Banknotes==\n{{Main|Banknotes of the Canadian dollar}}\n\n[[File:Dominion of Canada one Dollar banknote of 1898.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|$1 Dominion of Canada note issued in 1898]]\n[[File:CAN-S559-Bank of Montreal-10 Dollars (1935).jpg|thumb|[[Bank of Montreal]], 10 dollars (1935).

This new government agency became the sole issuer of all federal notes. It began issuing notes in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $25, $50, $100, $500 and $1000. In 1944, the chartered banks were prohibited from issuing their own currency, with the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] and the Bank of Montreal among the last to issue notes.\n\nSignificant design changes to the notes have occurred since 1935, with new series introduced in 1937, 1954, 1970, 1986, and 2001. In June 2011, newly designed notes printed on a [[Polymer banknote|polymer]] substrate, as opposed to cotton fibre, were announced; the first of these polymer notes, the $100 bill, began circulation on November 14, 2011, the $50 bill began circulation on March 26, 2012, the $20 denomination began circulation on November 7, 2012, and the $5 and $10 denominations began circulation on November 12, 2013.\n\nSince 1935, all banknotes are printed by the [[Ottawa]]-based [[Canadian Bank Note Company]] under contract to the Bank of Canada. Previously, a second company, BA International (founded in 1866 as the British American Bank Note Company), shared printing duties. In 2011, BA International announced it would close its banknote printing business and cease printing banknotes at the end of 2012;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.printaction.com/News/2011121-g-d-banknote.html |title=G&D to Shutter Banknote Printing in Ottawa |publisher=PrintAction |date=December 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}</ref> since then, the Canadian Bank Note Company has been the sole printer of Canadian banknotes.\n\nAll banknotes from series prior to the current polymer series are now considered unfit for circulation due to their lacking of any modern security features, such as a metallic stripe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/unfit_notes_poster.pdf |title=Unfit Bank Notes |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=October 2012 |website=bankofcanada.ca |publisher=Bank of Canada |access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> Financial institutions must return the banknotes to the Bank of Canada, which will destroy them.{{sfn|Bank of Canada: Unfit Bank Notes}} Individuals may keep the banknotes indefinitely.{{sfn|CBC News|2000}}\n\n==Legal tender==\nCanadian dollar banknotes issued by the Bank of Canada are [[legal tender]] in Canada. However, commercial transactions may legally be settled in any manner agreed by the parties involved.\n\nLegal tender of Canadian coinage is governed by the ''Currency Act'', which sets out limits of:<ref name=\"legaltender\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2329954&Language=e&Mode=1&File=25 |title=BILL C-41 \u2013 As passed by the House of Commons |publisher=Parliament of Canada |access-date=December 31, 2008}}</ref>\n* $40 if the denomination is $2 or greater but does not exceed $10;\n* $25 if the denomination is $1;\n* $10 if the denomination is 10\u00a2 or greater but less than $1;\n* $5 if the denomination is 5\u00a2;\n* 25\u00a2 if the denomination is 1\u00a2.\n\nRetailers in Canada may refuse bank notes without breaking the law. According to legal guidelines, the method of payment has to be mutually agreed upon by the parties involved with the transactions. For example, stores may refuse $100 banknotes if they feel that would put them at risk of being [[counterfeit]] victims; however, official policy suggests that the retailers should evaluate the impact of that approach. In the case that no mutually acceptable form of payment can be found for the tender, the parties involved should seek legal advice.<ref name=\"counterfeit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/scams/counterfaq_e.htm |title=Currency Counterfeiting&nbsp;\u2013 FAQ |publisher=[[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215102641/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/scams/counterfaq_e.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=February 15, 2008}}</ref>\n\nCanadian dollars, especially coins, are accepted by some businesses in the northernmost cities of the United States and in many Canadian [[snowbird (people)|snowbird]] enclaves, just as U.S. dollars are accepted by some Canadian businesses.<ref>{{cite news |title=6 US Destinations That Will Accept Canadian Money Without Converting It |url=https://www.narcity.com/ca/on/toronto/travel/8-us-destinations-that-will-accept-canadian-money-without-converting-it |accessdate=Feb 11, 2019 |publisher=NARCITY |date=Mar 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, [[Iceland]] considered adopting the Canadian dollar as a stable alternative to the [[Icelandic kr\u00f3na]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/iceland-eyes-loonie-canada-ready-to-talk/article2356634/ |title=Canadian envoy to Iceland sparks loonie controversy |first=Barrie |last=Mckenna |date=March 2, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |access-date=March 4, 2012 |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120304152551/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/iceland-eyes-loonie-canada-ready-to-talk/article2356634/ |archive-date = March 4, 2012 |url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/15/iceland-canadian-loonie/ |title=If Iceland adopts the loonie, Greenland could soon follow: economist |first=Tristin |last=Hopper |date=May 15, 2012 |newspaper=[[The National Post]] |access-date=May 15, 2012}}</ref>\nCanada was favoured due to its northern geography and similar resource based economy, in addition to its relative economic stability.<ref>{{cite news |last=McKenna |first=Barrie |title=Canadian envoy to Iceland sparks loonie controversy |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/iceland-eyes-loonie-canada-ready-to-talk/article2356634/ |access-date=March 3, 2012 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=March 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302181026/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/iceland-eyes-loonie-canada-ready-to-talk/article2356634/ |archive-date=March 2, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Canada ready to discuss letting Iceland use its dollar |url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2012/03/02/canada-ready-to-discuss-letting-iceland-use-its-dollar/ |publisher=icenews.is |access-date=March 8, 2012}}</ref> The Canadian ambassador to Iceland said that Iceland could adopt the currency; although Iceland ultimately decided not to move on with the proposal.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/top-business-stories/canadian-dollar-a-poor-choice-for-iceland-central-bank-says/article4564361/ |title=Canadian dollar a 'poor choice' for Iceland, central bank says |first=Michael |last=Babad |date=September 24, 2012 |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=November 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Value==\n[[File:CAD-USD v2.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The cost of one [[United States dollar]] in Canadian dollars from 1990]]\n[[File:CAD-EUR 1999-.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The cost of one [[Euro]] in Canadian dollars from 1999]]\n<!-- Editor, please don't change this page every time you hear about recent high or low.
