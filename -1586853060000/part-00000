It uses a [[link-state routing protocol|link state routing]] (LSR) algorithm and falls into the group of [[interior gateway protocol]]s (IGPs), operating within a single [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]] (AS). It is defined as OSPF Version 2 in RFC 2328 (1998) for [[IPv4]].<ref name=\"rfc2328\">{{Cite IETF|rfc=2328|std=54|title=OSPF Version 2|author=J.

It implements [[Dijkstra's algorithm]], also known as the shortest path first (SPF) algorithm. As a [[link-state routing protocol]] it was based on the link-state algorithm developed for the [[ARPANET]] in 1980 and the [[IS-IS]] routing protocol. OSPF was first standardised in 1989 as RFC 1131, which is now known as OSPF version 1. The development work for OSPF prior to its codification as open standard was undertaken largely by the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], which developed its own proprietary [[DECnet]] protocols.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=237}}</ref> \n\nRouting protocols like OSPF calculate the ''shortest'' route to a destination through the network based on an algorithm. The first routing protocol that was widely implemented, the [[Routing Information Protocol]] (RIP), calculated the shortest route based on hops, that is the number of [[Router (computing)|routers]] that an [[IP packet (disambiguation)|IP packet]]<!--intentional link to disambig, could be either IPv4 or IPv6 packet--> had to traverse to reach the destination host. RIP successfully implemented [[dynamic routing]], where routing tables change if the [[network topology]] changes. But RIP did not adapt its routing according to changing network conditions, such as [[Data-rate units|data-transfer rate]]. Demand grew for a dynamic routing protocol that could calculate the ''fastest'' route to a destination. OSPF was developed so that the shortest path through a network was calculated based on the ''cost'' of the route, taking into account [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], delay and load.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=223}}</ref> Therefore OSPF undertakes route cost calculation on the basis of link-cost parameters, which can be weighted by the administrator. OSPF was quickly adopted because it became known for reliably calculating routes through large and complex local area networks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=232}}</ref> \n\nAs a link state routing protocol, OSPF maintains link state databases, which are really network topology maps, on every router on which it is implemented. The ''state'' of a given route in the network is the cost, and OSPF algorithm allows every router to calculate the cost of the routes to any given reachable destination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=238}}</ref> Unless the administrator has made a configuration, the link cost of a path connected to a router is determined by the [[bit rate]] (1 Gbit/s, 10 Gbit/s, etc) of the interface. A router interface with OSPF will then advertise its link cost to neighbouring routers through multicast, known as the ''hello procedure''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=244}}</ref> All routers with OSPF implementation keep sending hello packets, and thus changes in the cost of their links become known to neighbouring routers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P.

This process of flooding link state information through the network is known as ''synchronisation''. Based on this information, all routers with OSPF implementation continuously update their link state databases with information about the network topology and adjust their routing tables.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=247}}</ref> \n\nAn OSPF network can be structured, or subdivided, into routing ''areas'' to simplify administration and optimize traffic and resource utilization. Areas are identified by 32-bit numbers, expressed either simply in decimal, or often in the same [[dot-decimal notation]] used for IPv4 addresses. By convention, area 0 (zero), or 0.0.0.0, represents the core or ''backbone'' area of an OSPF network. While the identifications of other areas may be chosen at will; administrators often select the IP address of a main router in an area as the area identifier. Each additional area must have a connection to the OSPF backbone area. Such connections are maintained by an interconnecting router, known as an area border router (ABR). An ABR maintains separate link-state databases for each area it serves and maintains [[Route summarization|summarized routes]] for all areas in the network.\n\nOSPF detects changes in the topology, such as link failures, and [[Convergence (routing)|converges]] on a new loop-free routing structure within seconds.<ref>{{citation |url=https://routing-bits.com/2009/08/06/ospf-convergence/ |title=OSPF Convergence |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=2016-06-13}}</ref> \n\nOSPF has become a popular dynamic routing protocol. Other commonly used dynamic routing protocols are the RIPv2 and the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP). <ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=230}}</ref> Today [[Router (computing)|routers]] support at least one interior gateway protocol to advertise their [[routing tables]] within a local area network. Frequently implemented interior gateway protocols besides OSPF are RIPv2, IS-IS, and [[EIGRP]] (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). <ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=269}}</ref>.\n\n==Router relationships==\nOSPF supports complex networks with multiple routers, including backup routers, to balance traffic load on multiple links to other subnets. Neighboring routers in the same [[broadcast domain]] or at each end of a [[point-to-point communication (telecommunications)|point-to-point link]] communicate with each other via the OSPF protocol. Routers form ''adjacencies'' when they have detected each other. This detection is initiated when a router identifies itself in a ''Hello'' protocol packet. Upon acknowledgment, this establishes a ''two-way state'' and the most basic relationship. The routers in an Ethernet or Frame Relay network select a ''Designated Router'' (DR) and a ''Backup Designated Router'' (BDR) which act as a hub to reduce traffic between routers. OSPF uses both [[unicast]] and multicast transmission modes to send \"Hello\" packets and link state updates.\n\nAs a link state routing protocol, OSPF establishes and maintains neighbor relationships for exchanging routing updates with other routers. The neighbor relationship table is called an ''adjacency database''. Two OSPF routers are neighbors if they are members of the same subnet and share the same area ID, subnet mask, timers and authentication. In essence, OSPF neighborship is a relationship between two routers that allow them to see and understand each other but nothing more. OSPF neighbors do not exchange any routing information \u2013 the only packets they exchange are Hello packets.  OSPF adjacencies are formed between selected neighbors and allow them to exchange routing information. Two routers must first be neighbors and only then, can they become adjacent. Two routers become adjacent if at least one of them is Designated Router or Backup Designated Router (on multiaccess type networks), or they are interconnected by a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint network type. For forming a neighbor relationship between, the interfaces used to form the relationship must be in the same OSPF area. While an interface may be configured to belong to multiple areas, this is generally not practiced. When configured in a second area, an interface must be configured as a secondary interface.\n\n===Adjacency state machine===\nEach OSPF router within a network communicates with other neighboring routers on each connecting interface to establish the states of all adjacencies. Every such communication sequence is a separate ''conversation'' identified by the pair of router IDs of the communicating neighbors. RFC 2328 specifies the protocol for initiating these conversations (''Hello Protocol'') and for establishing full adjacencies (''Database Description Packets'', ''Link State Request Packets''). During its course, each router conversation transitions through a maximum of eight conditions defined by a state machine:<ref name=\"rfc2328\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/13685-13.html |title=OSPF Neighbor States |website=Cisco |access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>\n#Down: The state ''down'' represents the initial state of a conversation when no information has been exchanged and retained between routers with the Hello Protocol.\n#Attempt: The ''Attempt'' state is similar to the ''Down'' state, except that a router is in the process of efforts to establish a conversation with another router, but is only used on [[Non-broadcast multiple-access network|NBMA]] networks.\n#Init: The ''Init'' state indicates that a HELLO packet has been received from a neighbor, but the router has not established a two-way conversation.\n#2-Way: The ''2-Way'' state indicates the establishment of a bidirectional conversation between two routers. This state immediately precedes the establishment of adjacency. This is the lowest state of a router that may be considered as a Designated Router.\n#ExStart: The ''ExStart'' state is the first step of adjacency of two routers.\n#Exchange: In the ''Exchange'' state, a router is sending its link state database information to the adjacent neighbor. At this state, a router is able to exchange all OSPF routing protocol packets. \n#Loading: In the ''Loading'' state, a router requests the most recent [[Link-state advertisement]]s (LSAs) from its neighbor discovered in the previous state.\n#Full: The ''Full'' state concludes the conversation when the routers are fully adjacent, and the state appears in all router- and network-LSAs. The link state databases of the neighbors are fully synchronized.\n\n===OSPF messages===\nUnlike other routing protocols, OSPF does not carry data via a transport protocol, such as the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) or the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP). Instead, OSPF forms IP datagrams directly, packaging them using protocol number 89 for the [[List of IP protocol numbers|IP Protocol field]]. OSPF defines five different message types, for various types of communication:\n;Hello: ''Hello'' messages are used as a form of greeting, to allow a router to discover other adjacent routers on its local links and networks. The messages establish relationships between neighboring devices (called adjacencies) and communicate key parameters about how OSPF is to be used in the autonomous system or area. During normal operation, routers send hello messages to their neighbors at regular intervals (the ''hello interval''); if a router stops receiving hello messages from a neighbor, after a set period (the ''dead interval'') the router will assume the neighbor has gone down.\n;{{anchor|Database description}}Database Description (''DBD''): ''Database description'' messages contain descriptions of the topology of the autonomous system or area. They convey the contents of the link-state database (LSDB) for the area from one router to another. Communicating a large LSDB may require several messages to be sent by having the sending device designated as a master device and sending messages in sequence, with the slave (recipient of the LSDB information) responding with acknowledgements.\n;Link State Request (''LSR''): ''Link state request'' messages are used by one router to request updated information about a portion of the LSDB from another router. The message specifies the link(s) for which the requesting device wants more current information.\n;Link State Update (''LSU''): ''Link state update'' messages contain updated information about the state of certain links on the LSDB. They are sent in response to a Link State Request message, and also broadcast or multicast by routers on a regular basis. Their contents are used to update the information in the LSDBs of routers that receive them.\n;Link State Acknowledgment (''LSAck''): ''Link state acknowledgement'' messages provide reliability to the link-state exchange process, by explicitly acknowledging receipt of a Link State Update message.\n\n==OSPF areas ==\nAn OSPF network can be divided into ''areas'' that are logical groupings of hosts and networks. An area includes its connecting router having interfaces connected to the network. Each area maintains a separate link state database whose information may be summarized towards the rest of the network by the connecting router. Thus, the topology of an area is unknown outside the area. This reduces the routing traffic between parts of an autonomous system.\n\nAreas are uniquely identified with 32-bit numbers. The area identifiers are commonly written in the dot-decimal notation, familiar from IPv4 addressing. However, they are not IP addresses and may duplicate, without conflict, any IPv4 address. The area identifiers for IPv6 implementations (OSPFv3) also use 32-bit identifiers written in the same notation. When dotted formatting is omitted, most implementations expand area ''1'' to the area identifier ''0.0.0.1'', but some have been known to expand it as ''1.0.0.0''.{{citation needed|reason=which implementations?|date=January 2017}}\n\nOSPF defines several special area types:\n\n===Backbone area===\nThe backbone area (also known as ''area 0'' or ''area 0.0.0.0'') forms the core of an OSPF network. All other areas are connected to it, either directly or through other routers. Inter-area routing happens via routers connected to the backbone area and to their own associated areas. It is the logical and physical structure for the 'OSPF domain' and is attached to all nonzero areas in the OSPF domain. Note that in OSPF the term Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR) is historic, in the sense that many OSPF domains can coexist in the same Internet-visible autonomous system, RFC 1996.<ref>{{Harv|ASGuidelines|1996|p=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Hawkinson\n  | first = J\n  |author2=T.

The backbone must be contiguous, but it does not need to be physically contiguous; backbone connectivity can be established and maintained through the configuration of virtual links.\n\nAll OSPF areas must connect to the backbone area. This connection, however, can be through a virtual link. For example, assume area 0.0.0.1 has a physical connection to area 0.0.0.0. Further assume that area 0.0.0.2 has no direct connection to the backbone, but this area does have a connection to area 0.0.0.1. Area 0.0.0.2 can use a virtual link through the ''transit area'' 0.0.0.1 to reach the backbone.  To be a transit area, an area has to have the transit attribute, so it cannot be stubby in any way.\n\n===Stub area===\nA stub area is an area which does not receive route advertisements external to the AS and routing from within the area is based entirely on a default route. An ABR deletes type 4, 5 LSAs from internal routers, sends them a default route of 0.0.0.0 and turns itself into a default gateway. This reduces LSDB and routing table size for internal routers.\n\nModifications to the basic concept of stub area have been implemented by systems vendors, such as the ''totally stubby area'' (TSA) and the ''not-so-stubby area'' (NSSA), both an extension in [[Cisco Systems]] routing equipment.\n\n====Not-so-stubby area====\nA ''not-so-stubby area'' (NSSA) is a type of stub area that can import autonomous system external routes and send them to other areas, but still cannot receive AS-external routes from other areas.<ref name=\"rfc3101\">{{cite web\n  | last = Murphy\n  | first = P.\n  | title = The OSPF Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA) Option\n  | publisher = The Internet Society\n  | date=January 2003\n  | url = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3101\n  | accessdate =  2014-06-22\n}}</ref> NSSA is an extension of the stub area feature that allows the injection of external routes in a limited fashion into the stub area. A case study simulates an NSSA getting around the Stub Area problem of not being able to import external addresses. It visualizes the following activities: the ASBR imports external addresses with a type 7 LSA, the ABR converts a type 7 LSA to type 5 and floods it to other areas, the ABR acts as an \"ASBR\" for other areas.\nThe ASBRs do not take type 5 LSAs and then convert to type 7 LSAs for the area.\n\n====Proprietary extensions====\nSeveral vendors (Cisco, Allied Telesis, Juniper, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, Quagga), implement the two extensions below for stub and not-so-stubby areas. Although not covered by RFC standards, they are considered by many to be standard features in OSPF implementations.\n\n;Totally stubby area: A ''totally stubby area'' is similar to a stub area. However, this area does not allow ''summary'' routes in addition to not having ''external'' routes, that is, ''inter-area'' (IA) routes are not summarized into totally stubby areas.  The only way for traffic to get routed outside the area is a default route which is the only Type-3 LSA advertised into the area.  When there is only one route out of the area, fewer routing decisions have to be made by the route processor, which lowers system resource utilization.\n\n:Occasionally, it is said that a TSA can have only one ABR.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.groupstudy.com/bookstore/samples/thomas/|title=Stub Area Design Golden Rules|publisher=Groupstudy.com |accessdate=2011-11-30}}. Note: This is not necessarily true. If there are multiple ABRs, as might be required for high availability, routers interior to the TSA will send non-intra-area traffic to the ABR with the lowest intra-area metric (the \"closest\" ABR) but that requires special configuration.</ref>\n\n;NSSA totally stubby area: An addition to the standard functionality of an NSSA, the ''totally stubby NSSA'' is an NSSA that takes on the attributes of a TSA, meaning that type 3 and 4 summary routes are not flooded into this type of area.  It is also possible to declare an area both totally stubby and not-so-stubby, which means that the area will receive only the default route from area 0.0.0.0, but can also contain an autonomous system boundary router (ASBR) that accepts external routing information and injects it into the local area, and from the local area into area 0.0.0.0.\n\n:Redistribution into an NSSA area creates a special type of LSA known as type 7, which can exist only in an NSSA area. An NSSA ASBR generates this LSA, and an NSSA ABR router translates it into type 5 LSA which gets propagated into the OSPF domain.\n\nA newly acquired subsidiary is one example of where it might be suitable for an area to be simultaneously not-so-stubby and totally stubby if the practical place to put an ASBR is on the edge of a totally stubby area. In such a case, the ASBR does send externals into the totally stubby area, and they are available to OSPF speakers within that area. In Cisco's implementation, the external routes can be summarized before injecting them into the totally stubby area. In general, the ASBR should not advertise default into the TSA-NSSA, although this can work with extremely careful design and operation, for the limited special cases in which such an advertisement makes sense.\n\nBy declaring the totally stubby area as NSSA, no external routes from the backbone, except the default route, enter the area being discussed. The externals do reach area 0.0.0.0 via the TSA-NSSA, but no routes other than the default route enter the TSA-NSSA. Routers in the TSA-NSSA send all traffic to the ABR, except to routes advertised by the ASBR.\n\n===Transit area===\nA transit area is an area with two or more OSPF border routers and is used to pass network traffic from one adjacent area to another. The transit area does not originate this traffic and is not the destination of such traffic.\n\n==Router types==\nOSPF defines the following overlapping categories of routers:\n;Internal router (IR): An ''internal router'' has all its interfaces belonging to the same area.\n;Area border router (ABR): An ''area border router''  is a router that connects one or more areas to the main backbone network.  It is considered a member of all areas it is connected to.  An ABR keeps multiple [[Instance (computer science)|instances]] of the link-state database in memory, one for each area to which that router is connected.\n;Backbone router (BR): A ''backbone router'' has an interface to the backbone area. Backbone routers may also be area routers, but do not have to be.\n;Autonomous system boundary router (ASBR):  An ''autonomous system boundary router'' is a router that is connected by using more than one routing protocol and that exchanges routing information with routers autonomous systems.  ASBRs typically also run an exterior routing protocol (e.g., [[BGP]]), or use static routes, or both.  An ASBR is used to [[Route redistribution|distribute routes]] received from other, external ASs throughout its own autonomous system. An ASBR creates External LSAs for external addresses and floods them to all areas via ABR. Routers in other areas use ABRs as next hops to access external addresses. Then ABRs forward packets to the ASBR that announces the external addresses.\n\nThe router type is an attribute of an OSPF process. A given physical router may have one or more OSPF processes. For example, a router that is connected to more than one area, and which receives routes from a BGP process connected to another AS, is both an area border router and an autonomous system boundary router.\n\nEach router has an identifier, customarily written in the dotted decimal format (e.g., 1.2.3.4) of an IP address. This identifier must be established in every OSPF instance. If not explicitly configured, the highest logical IP address will be duplicated as the router identifier. However, since the router identifier is not an IP address, it does not have to be a part of any routable subnet in the network, and often isn't to avoid confusion.\n\n==Router attributes==\nIn addition to the four router types, OSPF uses the terms ''designated router'' (DR) and ''backup designated router'' (BDR), which are attributes of a router interface.\n;Designated router: A ''designated router'' (DR) is the router interface elected among all routers on a particular multiaccess network segment, generally assumed to be broadcast multiaccess. Special techniques, often vendor-dependent, may be needed to support the DR function on non-broadcast multiaccess (NBMA) media.  It is usually wise to configure the individual virtual circuits of a NBMA subnet as individual point-to-point lines; the techniques used are implementation-dependent.\n;Backup designated router: A ''backup designated router'' (BDR) is a router that becomes the designated router if the current designated router has a problem or fails.  The BDR is the OSPF router with second highest priority at the time of the last election.\n\nA given router can have some interfaces that are designated (DR) and others that are backup designated (BDR), and others that are non-designated. If no router is a DR or a BDR on a given subnet, the BDR is first elected, and then a second election is held for the DR.<ref name=\"rfc2328\"></ref>{{rp|75}} The DR is elected based on the following default criteria:\n*  If the priority setting on an OSPF router is set to 0, that means it can NEVER become a DR or BDR.\n*  When a DR fails and the BDR takes over, there is another election to see who becomes the replacement BDR.\n*  The router sending the Hello packets with the highest priority wins the election.\n*  If two or more routers tie with the highest priority setting, the router sending the Hello with the highest RID (Router ID) wins. NOTE: a RID is the highest logical (loopback) IP address configured on a router, if no logical/loopback IP address is set then the router uses the highest IP address configured on its active interfaces (e.g. {{IPaddr|192.168.0.1}} would be higher than {{IPaddr|10.1.1.2}}).\n*  Usually the router with the second highest priority number becomes the BDR.\n*  The priority values range between 0 \u2013 255,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/iproute_ospf/command/reference/iro_cr_book.pdf |title=Cisco IOS IP Routing: OSPF Command Reference |date=April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425041808/http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/iproute_ospf/command/reference/iro_cr_book.pdf |archivedate=April 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all |publisher=[[Cisco Systems]]}}</ref> with a higher value increasing its chances of becoming DR or BDR.\n*  If a higher priority OSPF router comes online after the election has taken place, it will not become DR or BDR until (at least) the DR and BDR fail.\n*  If the current DR 'goes down' the current BDR becomes the new DR and a new election takes place to find another BDR. If the new DR then 'goes down' and the original DR is now available, still previously chosen BDR will become DR.\n\nDR's exist for the purpose of reducing network traffic by providing a source for routing updates. The DR maintains a complete topology table of the network and sends the updates to the other routers via multicast. All routers in a multi-access network segment will form a slave/master relationship with the DR. They will form adjacencies with the DR and BDR only. Every time a router sends an update, it sends it to the DR and BDR on the multicast address {{IPaddr|224.0.0.6}}. The DR will then send the update out to all other routers in the area, to the multicast address {{IPaddr|224.0.0.5}}. This way all the routers do not have to constantly update each other, and can rather get all their updates from a single source.  The use of multicasting further reduces the network load.  DRs and BDRs are always setup/elected on OSPF broadcast networks.  DR's can also be elected on NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access) networks such as Frame Relay or ATM.  DRs or BDRs are not elected on point-to-point links (such as a point-to-point WAN connection) because the two routers on either sides of the link must become fully adjacent and the bandwidth between them cannot be further optimized. DR and non-DR routers evolve from 2-way to full adjacency relationships by exchanging DD, Request, and Update.\n\n==Routing metrics==\nOSPF uses ''path cost'' as its basic routing metric, which was defined by the standard not to equate to any standard value such as speed, so the network designer could pick a metric important to the design. In practice, it is determined by the speed (bandwidth) of the interface addressing the given route, although that tends to need network-specific scaling factors now that links faster than 25&nbsp;Mbit/s are common. Cisco uses a metric like (10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;bit/s)/bandwidth (the reference value, 10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;bit/s by default, can be adjusted). So, a 100&nbsp;Mbit/s link will have a cost of 1, a 10&nbsp;Mbit/s a cost of 10 and so on. But for links faster than 100&nbsp;Mbit/s, the cost would be <1.\n\nMetrics, however, are only directly comparable when of the same type. Four types of metrics are recognized. In decreasing preference, these types are (for example, an intra-area route is always preferred to an external route regardless of metric):\n# Intra-area\n# Inter-area\n# External Type 1, which includes both the external path cost and the sum of internal path costs to the ASBR that advertises the route,<ref>Whether an external route is based on a Type-5 LSA or a Type-7 LSA (NSSA) does not affect its preference. See RFC 3101, section 2.5.</ref>\n# External Type 2, the value of which is solely that of the external path cost,\n\n==OSPF v3==\nOSPF version 3 introduces modifications to the IPv4 implementation of the protocol.<ref name=\"rfc5340\" /> Except for virtual links, all neighbor exchanges use IPv6 link-local addressing exclusively. The IPv6 protocol runs per link, rather than based on the [[Subnetwork|subnet]]. All IP prefix information has been removed from the link-state advertisements and from the ''hello'' discovery packet making OSPFv3 essentially protocol-independent.

It implements [[Dijkstra's algorithm]], also known as the shortest path first (SPF) algorithm. As a [[link-state routing protocol]] it was based on the link-state algorithm developed for the [[ARPANET]] in 1980 and the [[IS-IS]] routing protocol. OSPF was first standardised in 1989 as RFC 1131, which is now known as OSPF version 1. The development work for OSPF prior to its codification as open standard was undertaken largely by the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], which developed its own proprietary [[DECnet]] protocols.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=237}}</ref> \n\nRouting protocols like OSPF calculate the ''shortest'' route to a destination through the network based on an algorithm. The first routing protocol that was widely implemented, the [[Routing Information Protocol]] (RIP), calculated the shortest route based on hops, that is the number of [[Router (computing)|routers]] that an [[IP packet (disambiguation)|IP packet]]<!--intentional link to disambig, could be either IPv4 or IPv6 packet--> had to traverse to reach the destination host. RIP successfully implemented [[dynamic routing]], where routing tables change if the [[network topology]] changes. But RIP did not adapt its routing according to changing network conditions, such as [[Data-rate units|data-transfer rate]]. Demand grew for a dynamic routing protocol that could calculate the ''fastest'' route to a destination. OSPF was developed so that the shortest path through a network was calculated based on the ''cost'' of the route, taking into account [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], delay and load.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=223}}</ref> Therefore OSPF undertakes route cost calculation on the basis of link-cost parameters, which can be weighted by the administrator. OSPF was quickly adopted because it became known for reliably calculating routes through large and complex local area networks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=232}}</ref> \n\nAs a link state routing protocol, OSPF maintains link state databases, which are really network topology maps, on every router on which it is implemented. The ''state'' of a given route in the network is the cost, and OSPF algorithm allows every router to calculate the cost of the routes to any given reachable destination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=238}}</ref> Unless the administrator has made a configuration, the link cost of a path connected to a router is determined by the [[bit rate]] (1 Gbit/s, 10 Gbit/s, etc) of the interface. A router interface with OSPF will then advertise its link cost to neighbouring routers through multicast, known as the ''hello procedure''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=244}}</ref> All routers with OSPF implementation keep sending hello packets, and thus changes in the cost of their links become known to neighbouring routers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P.

This process of flooding link state information through the network is known as ''synchronisation''. Based on this information, all routers with OSPF implementation continuously update their link state databases with information about the network topology and adjust their routing tables.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=247}}</ref> \n\nAn OSPF network can be structured, or subdivided, into routing ''areas'' to simplify administration and optimize traffic and resource utilization. Areas are identified by 32-bit numbers, expressed either simply in decimal, or often in the same [[dot-decimal notation]] used for IPv4 addresses. By convention, area 0 (zero), or 0.0.0.0, represents the core or ''backbone'' area of an OSPF network. While the identifications of other areas may be chosen at will; administrators often select the IP address of a main router in an area as the area identifier. Each additional area must have a connection to the OSPF backbone area. Such connections are maintained by an interconnecting router, known as an area border router (ABR). An ABR maintains separate link-state databases for each area it serves and maintains [[Route summarization|summarized routes]] for all areas in the network.\n\nOSPF detects changes in the topology, such as link failures, and [[Convergence (routing)|converges]] on a new loop-free routing structure within seconds.<ref>{{citation |url=https://routing-bits.com/2009/08/06/ospf-convergence/ |title=OSPF Convergence |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=2016-06-13}}</ref> \n\nOSPF has become a popular dynamic routing protocol. Other commonly used dynamic routing protocols are the RIPv2 and the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP). <ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=230}}</ref> Today [[Router (computing)|routers]] support at least one interior gateway protocol to advertise their [[routing tables]] within a local area network. Frequently implemented interior gateway protocols besides OSPF are RIPv2, IS-IS, and [[EIGRP]] (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). <ref>{{Cite book|title=Data Networks, IP and the Internet: Protocols, Design and Operation|author=Martin P. Clark|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003| isbn=9780470848562|pages=269}}</ref>.\n\n==Router relationships==\nOSPF supports complex networks with multiple routers, including backup routers, to balance traffic load on multiple links to other subnets. Neighboring routers in the same [[broadcast domain]] or at each end of a [[point-to-point communication (telecommunications)|point-to-point link]] communicate with each other via the OSPF protocol. Routers form ''adjacencies'' when they have detected each other. This detection is initiated when a router identifies itself in a ''Hello'' protocol packet. Upon acknowledgment, this establishes a ''two-way state'' and the most basic relationship. The routers in an Ethernet or Frame Relay network select a ''Designated Router'' (DR) and a ''Backup Designated Router'' (BDR) which act as a hub to reduce traffic between routers. OSPF uses both [[unicast]] and multicast transmission modes to send \"Hello\" packets and link state updates.\n\nAs a link state routing protocol, OSPF establishes and maintains neighbor relationships for exchanging routing updates with other routers. The neighbor relationship table is called an ''adjacency database''. Two OSPF routers are neighbors if they are members of the same subnet and share the same area ID, subnet mask, timers and authentication. In essence, OSPF neighborship is a relationship between two routers that allow them to see and understand each other but nothing more. OSPF neighbors do not exchange any routing information \u2013 the only packets they exchange are Hello packets.  OSPF adjacencies are formed between selected neighbors and allow them to exchange routing information. Two routers must first be neighbors and only then, can they become adjacent. Two routers become adjacent if at least one of them is Designated Router or Backup Designated Router (on multiaccess type networks), or they are interconnected by a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint network type. For forming a neighbor relationship between, the interfaces used to form the relationship must be in the same OSPF area. While an interface may be configured to belong to multiple areas, this is generally not practiced. When configured in a second area, an interface must be configured as a secondary interface.\n\n===Adjacency state machine===\nEach OSPF router within a network communicates with other neighboring routers on each connecting interface to establish the states of all adjacencies. Every such communication sequence is a separate ''conversation'' identified by the pair of router IDs of the communicating neighbors. RFC 2328 specifies the protocol for initiating these conversations (''Hello Protocol'') and for establishing full adjacencies (''Database Description Packets'', ''Link State Request Packets''). During its course, each router conversation transitions through a maximum of eight conditions defined by a state machine:<ref name=\"rfc2328\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/13685-13.html |title=OSPF Neighbor States |website=Cisco |access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>\n#Down: The state ''down'' represents the initial state of a conversation when no information has been exchanged and retained between routers with the Hello Protocol.\n#Attempt: The ''Attempt'' state is similar to the ''Down'' state, except that a router is in the process of efforts to establish a conversation with another router, but is only used on [[Non-broadcast multiple-access network|NBMA]] networks.\n#Init: The ''Init'' state indicates that a HELLO packet has been received from a neighbor, but the router has not established a two-way conversation.\n#2-Way: The ''2-Way'' state indicates the establishment of a bidirectional conversation between two routers. This state immediately precedes the establishment of adjacency. This is the lowest state of a router that may be considered as a Designated Router.\n#ExStart: The ''ExStart'' state is the first step of adjacency of two routers.\n#Exchange: In the ''Exchange'' state, a router is sending its link state database information to the adjacent neighbor. At this state, a router is able to exchange all OSPF routing protocol packets. \n#Loading: In the ''Loading'' state, a router requests the most recent [[Link-state advertisement]]s (LSAs) from its neighbor discovered in the previous state.\n#Full: The ''Full'' state concludes the conversation when the routers are fully adjacent, and the state appears in all router- and network-LSAs. The link state databases of the neighbors are fully synchronized.\n\n===OSPF messages===\nUnlike other routing protocols, OSPF does not carry data via a transport protocol, such as the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) or the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP). Instead, OSPF forms IP datagrams directly, packaging them using protocol number 89 for the [[List of IP protocol numbers|IP Protocol field]]. OSPF defines five different message types, for various types of communication:\n;Hello: ''Hello'' messages are used as a form of greeting, to allow a router to discover other adjacent routers on its local links and networks. The messages establish relationships between neighboring devices (called adjacencies) and communicate key parameters about how OSPF is to be used in the autonomous system or area. During normal operation, routers send hello messages to their neighbors at regular intervals (the ''hello interval''); if a router stops receiving hello messages from a neighbor, after a set period (the ''dead interval'') the router will assume the neighbor has gone down.\n;{{anchor|Database description}}Database Description (''DBD''): ''Database description'' messages contain descriptions of the topology of the autonomous system or area. They convey the contents of the link-state database (LSDB) for the area from one router to another. Communicating a large LSDB may require several messages to be sent by having the sending device designated as a master device and sending messages in sequence, with the slave (recipient of the LSDB information) responding with acknowledgements.\n;Link State Request (''LSR''): ''Link state request'' messages are used by one router to request updated information about a portion of the LSDB from another router. The message specifies the link(s) for which the requesting device wants more current information.\n;Link State Update (''LSU''): ''Link state update'' messages contain updated information about the state of certain links on the LSDB. They are sent in response to a Link State Request message, and also broadcast or multicast by routers on a regular basis. Their contents are used to update the information in the LSDBs of routers that receive them.\n;Link State Acknowledgment (''LSAck''): ''Link state acknowledgement'' messages provide reliability to the link-state exchange process, by explicitly acknowledging receipt of a Link State Update message.\n\n==OSPF areas ==\nAn OSPF network can be divided into ''areas'' that are logical groupings of hosts and networks. An area includes its connecting router having interfaces connected to the network. Each area maintains a separate link state database whose information may be summarized towards the rest of the network by the connecting router. Thus, the topology of an area is unknown outside the area. This reduces the routing traffic between parts of an autonomous system.\n\nAreas are uniquely identified with 32-bit numbers. The area identifiers are commonly written in the dot-decimal notation, familiar from IPv4 addressing. However, they are not IP addresses and may duplicate, without conflict, any IPv4 address. The area identifiers for IPv6 implementations (OSPFv3) also use 32-bit identifiers written in the same notation. When dotted formatting is omitted, most implementations expand area ''1'' to the area identifier ''0.0.0.1'', but some have been known to expand it as ''1.0.0.0''.{{citation needed|reason=which implementations?|date=January 2017}}\n\nOSPF defines several special area types:\n\n===Backbone area===\nThe backbone area (also known as ''area 0'' or ''area 0.0.0.0'') forms the core of an OSPF network. All other areas are connected to it, either directly or through other routers. Inter-area routing happens via routers connected to the backbone area and to their own associated areas. It is the logical and physical structure for the 'OSPF domain' and is attached to all nonzero areas in the OSPF domain. Note that in OSPF the term Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR) is historic, in the sense that many OSPF domains can coexist in the same Internet-visible autonomous system, RFC 1996.<ref>{{Harv|ASGuidelines|1996|p=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Hawkinson\n  | first = J\n  |author2=T.

The backbone must be contiguous, but it does not need to be physically contiguous; backbone connectivity can be established and maintained through the configuration of virtual links.\n\nAll OSPF areas must connect to the backbone area. This connection, however, can be through a virtual link. For example, assume area 0.0.0.1 has a physical connection to area 0.0.0.0. Further assume that area 0.0.0.2 has no direct connection to the backbone, but this area does have a connection to area 0.0.0.1. Area 0.0.0.2 can use a virtual link through the ''transit area'' 0.0.0.1 to reach the backbone.  To be a transit area, an area has to have the transit attribute, so it cannot be stubby in any way.\n\n===Stub area===\nA stub area is an area which does not receive route advertisements external to the AS and routing from within the area is based entirely on a default route. An ABR deletes type 4, 5 LSAs from internal routers, sends them a default route of 0.0.0.0 and turns itself into a default gateway. This reduces LSDB and routing table size for internal routers.\n\nModifications to the basic concept of stub areas exist in the ''not-so-stubby'' area (NSSA). In addition, several other proprietary variations have been implemented by systems vendors, such as the ''totally stubby area'' (TSA) and the ''NSSA totally stubby area'', both an extension in [[Cisco Systems]] routing equipment.\n\n====Not-so-stubby area====\nA ''not-so-stubby area'' (NSSA) is a type of stub area that can import autonomous system external routes and send them to other areas, but still cannot receive AS-external routes from other areas.<ref name=\"rfc3101\">{{cite web\n  | last = Murphy\n  | first = P.\n  | title = The OSPF Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA) Option\n  | publisher = The Internet Society\n  | date=January 2003\n  | url = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3101\n  | accessdate =  2014-06-22\n}}</ref> NSSA is an extension of the stub area feature that allows the injection of external routes in a limited fashion into the stub area. A case study simulates an NSSA getting around the Stub Area problem of not being able to import external addresses. It visualizes the following activities: the ASBR imports external addresses with a type 7 LSA, the ABR converts a type 7 LSA to type 5 and floods it to other areas, the ABR acts as an \"ASBR\" for other areas.\nThe ASBRs do not take type 5 LSAs and then convert to type 7 LSAs for the area.\n\n====Proprietary extensions====\nSeveral vendors (Cisco, Allied Telesis, Juniper, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, Quagga), implement the two extensions below for stub and not-so-stubby areas. Although not covered by RFC standards, they are considered by many to be standard features in OSPF implementations.\n\n;Totally stubby area: A ''totally stubby area'' is similar to a stub area. However, this area does not allow ''summary'' routes in addition to not having ''external'' routes, that is, ''inter-area'' (IA) routes are not summarized into totally stubby areas.  The only way for traffic to get routed outside the area is a default route which is the only Type-3 LSA advertised into the area.  When there is only one route out of the area, fewer routing decisions have to be made by the route processor, which lowers system resource utilization.\n\n:Occasionally, it is said that a TSA can have only one ABR.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.groupstudy.com/bookstore/samples/thomas/|title=Stub Area Design Golden Rules|publisher=Groupstudy.com |accessdate=2011-11-30}}.

If there are multiple ABRs, as might be required for high availability, routers interior to the TSA will send non-intra-area traffic to the ABR with the lowest intra-area metric (the \"closest\" ABR) but that requires special configuration.</ref>\n\n;NSSA totally stubby area: An addition to the standard functionality of an NSSA, the ''totally stubby NSSA'' is an NSSA that takes on the attributes of a TSA, meaning that type 3 and 4 summary routes are not flooded into this type of area.  It is also possible to declare an area both totally stubby and not-so-stubby, which means that the area will receive only the default route from area 0.0.0.0, but can also contain an autonomous system boundary router (ASBR) that accepts external routing information and injects it into the local area, and from the local area into area 0.0.0.0.\n\n:Redistribution into an NSSA area creates a special type of LSA known as type 7, which can exist only in an NSSA area. An NSSA ASBR generates this LSA, and an NSSA ABR router translates it into type 5 LSA which gets propagated into the OSPF domain.\n\nA newly acquired subsidiary is one example of where it might be suitable for an area to be simultaneously not-so-stubby and totally stubby if the practical place to put an ASBR is on the edge of a totally stubby area. In such a case, the ASBR does send externals into the totally stubby area, and they are available to OSPF speakers within that area. In Cisco's implementation, the external routes can be summarized before injecting them into the totally stubby area. In general, the ASBR should not advertise default into the TSA-NSSA, although this can work with extremely careful design and operation, for the limited special cases in which such an advertisement makes sense.\n\nBy declaring the totally stubby area as NSSA, no external routes from the backbone, except the default route, enter the area being discussed. The externals do reach area 0.0.0.0 via the TSA-NSSA, but no routes other than the default route enter the TSA-NSSA. Routers in the TSA-NSSA send all traffic to the ABR, except to routes advertised by the ASBR.\n\n===Transit area===\nA transit area is an area with two or more OSPF border routers and is used to pass network traffic from one adjacent area to another. The transit area does not originate this traffic and is not the destination of such traffic.\n\n==Router types==\nOSPF defines the following overlapping categories of routers:\n;Internal router (IR): An ''internal router'' has all its interfaces belonging to the same area.\n;Area border router (ABR): An ''area border router''  is a router that connects one or more areas to the main backbone network.  It is considered a member of all areas it is connected to.  An ABR keeps multiple [[Instance (computer science)|instances]] of the link-state database in memory, one for each area to which that router is connected.\n;Backbone router (BR): A ''backbone router'' has an interface to the backbone area. Backbone routers may also be area routers, but do not have to be.\n;Autonomous system boundary router (ASBR):  An ''autonomous system boundary router'' is a router that is connected by using more than one routing protocol and that exchanges routing information with routers autonomous systems.  ASBRs typically also run an exterior routing protocol (e.g., [[BGP]]), or use static routes, or both.  An ASBR is used to [[Route redistribution|distribute routes]] received from other, external ASs throughout its own autonomous system. An ASBR creates External LSAs for external addresses and floods them to all areas via ABR. Routers in other areas use ABRs as next hops to access external addresses. Then ABRs forward packets to the ASBR that announces the external addresses.\n\nThe router type is an attribute of an OSPF process. A given physical router may have one or more OSPF processes. For example, a router that is connected to more than one area, and which receives routes from a BGP process connected to another AS, is both an area border router and an autonomous system boundary router.\n\nEach router has an identifier, customarily written in the dotted decimal format (e.g., 1.2.3.4) of an IP address. This identifier must be established in every OSPF instance. If not explicitly configured, the highest logical IP address will be duplicated as the router identifier. However, since the router identifier is not an IP address, it does not have to be a part of any routable subnet in the network, and often isn't to avoid confusion.\n\n==Router attributes==\nIn addition to the four router types, OSPF uses the terms ''designated router'' (DR) and ''backup designated router'' (BDR), which are attributes of a router interface.\n;Designated router: A ''designated router'' (DR) is the router interface elected among all routers on a particular multiaccess network segment, generally assumed to be broadcast multiaccess. Special techniques, often vendor-dependent, may be needed to support the DR function on non-broadcast multiaccess (NBMA) media.  It is usually wise to configure the individual virtual circuits of a NBMA subnet as individual point-to-point lines; the techniques used are implementation-dependent.\n;Backup designated router: A ''backup designated router'' (BDR) is a router that becomes the designated router if the current designated router has a problem or fails.  The BDR is the OSPF router with second highest priority at the time of the last election.\n\nA given router can have some interfaces that are designated (DR) and others that are backup designated (BDR), and others that are non-designated. If no router is a DR or a BDR on a given subnet, the BDR is first elected, and then a second election is held for the DR.<ref name=\"rfc2328\"></ref>{{rp|75}} The DR is elected based on the following default criteria:\n*  If the priority setting on an OSPF router is set to 0, that means it can NEVER become a DR or BDR.\n*  When a DR fails and the BDR takes over, there is another election to see who becomes the replacement BDR.\n*  The router sending the Hello packets with the highest priority wins the election.\n*  If two or more routers tie with the highest priority setting, the router sending the Hello with the highest RID (Router ID) wins. NOTE: a RID is the highest logical (loopback) IP address configured on a router, if no logical/loopback IP address is set then the router uses the highest IP address configured on its active interfaces (e.g. {{IPaddr|192.168.0.1}} would be higher than {{IPaddr|10.1.1.2}}).\n*  Usually the router with the second highest priority number becomes the BDR.\n*  The priority values range between 0 \u2013 255,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/iproute_ospf/command/reference/iro_cr_book.pdf |title=Cisco IOS IP Routing: OSPF Command Reference |date=April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425041808/http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/iproute_ospf/command/reference/iro_cr_book.pdf |archivedate=April 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all |publisher=[[Cisco Systems]]}}</ref> with a higher value increasing its chances of becoming DR or BDR.\n*  If a higher priority OSPF router comes online after the election has taken place, it will not become DR or BDR until (at least) the DR and BDR fail.\n*  If the current DR 'goes down' the current BDR becomes the new DR and a new election takes place to find another BDR. If the new DR then 'goes down' and the original DR is now available, still previously chosen BDR will become DR.\n\nDR's exist for the purpose of reducing network traffic by providing a source for routing updates. The DR maintains a complete topology table of the network and sends the updates to the other routers via multicast. All routers in a multi-access network segment will form a slave/master relationship with the DR. They will form adjacencies with the DR and BDR only. Every time a router sends an update, it sends it to the DR and BDR on the multicast address {{IPaddr|224.0.0.6}}. The DR will then send the update out to all other routers in the area, to the multicast address {{IPaddr|224.0.0.5}}. This way all the routers do not have to constantly update each other, and can rather get all their updates from a single source.  The use of multicasting further reduces the network load.  DRs and BDRs are always setup/elected on OSPF broadcast networks.  DR's can also be elected on NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access) networks such as Frame Relay or ATM.  DRs or BDRs are not elected on point-to-point links (such as a point-to-point WAN connection) because the two routers on either sides of the link must become fully adjacent and the bandwidth between them cannot be further optimized. DR and non-DR routers evolve from 2-way to full adjacency relationships by exchanging DD, Request, and Update.\n\n==Routing metrics==\nOSPF uses ''path cost'' as its basic routing metric, which was defined by the standard not to equate to any standard value such as speed, so the network designer could pick a metric important to the design. In practice, it is determined by the speed (bandwidth) of the interface addressing the given route, although that tends to need network-specific scaling factors now that links faster than 25&nbsp;Mbit/s are common. Cisco uses a metric like (10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;bit/s)/bandwidth (the reference value, 10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;bit/s by default, can be adjusted). So, a 100&nbsp;Mbit/s link will have a cost of 1, a 10&nbsp;Mbit/s a cost of 10 and so on. But for links faster than 100&nbsp;Mbit/s, the cost would be <1.\n\nMetrics, however, are only directly comparable when of the same type. Four types of metrics are recognized. In decreasing preference, these types are (for example, an intra-area route is always preferred to an external route regardless of metric):\n# Intra-area\n# Inter-area\n# External Type 1, which includes both the external path cost and the sum of internal path costs to the ASBR that advertises the route,<ref>Whether an external route is based on a Type-5 LSA or a Type-7 LSA (NSSA) does not affect its preference. See RFC 3101, section 2.5.</ref>\n# External Type 2, the value of which is solely that of the external path cost,\n\n==OSPF v3==\nOSPF version 3 introduces modifications to the IPv4 implementation of the protocol.<ref name=\"rfc5340\" /> Except for virtual links, all neighbor exchanges use IPv6 link-local addressing exclusively. The IPv6 protocol runs per link, rather than based on the [[Subnetwork|subnet]]. All IP prefix information has been removed from the link-state advertisements and from the ''hello'' discovery packet making OSPFv3 essentially protocol-independent.  Despite the expanded IP addressing to 128-bits in IPv6, area and router identifications are still based on 32-bit numbers.\n\n==OSPF Extensions==\n\n===Traffic engineering===\nOSPF-TE is an extension to OSPF extending the expressivity to allow for traffic engineering and use on non-IP networks.<ref>{{cite IETF\n  | last = Katz\n  | first = D\n  |author2=D.

These extensions allow OSPF-TE to run completely out of band of the data plane network. This means that it can also be used on non-IP networks, such as optical networks.\n\nOSPF-TE is used in [[GMPLS]] networks as a means to describe the topology over which GMPLS paths can be established. GMPLS uses its own path setup and forwarding protocols, once it has the full network map.\n\nIn the [[Resource Reservation Protocol]] (RSVP), OSPF-TE is used for recording and flooding RSVP signaled bandwidth reservations for [[label switched path]]s within the link-state database.\n\n===Optical routing===\n{{IETF RFC|3717}} documents work in optical routing for IP based on extensions to OSPF and IS-IS.<ref>{{cite IETF\n  | author1 = B.

It has many features that allow the imposition of policies about the propagation of routes that it may be appropriate to keep local, for load sharing, and for selective route importing. IS-IS, in contrast, can be tuned for lower overhead in a stable network, the sort more common in ISP than enterprise networks. There are some historical accidents that made IS-IS the preferred IGP for ISPs, but ISPs today may well choose to use the features of the now-efficient implementations of OSPF,<ref>{{Cite conference\n  | first = Howard\n  | last = Berkowitz\n  | title = OSPF Goodies for ISPs\n  | url = https://www.nanog.org/meetings/abstract?id=1149\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160612140344/https://www.nanog.org/meetings/abstract?id=1149\n  | archive-date = 2016-06-12\n  | conference = North American Network Operators Group NANOG 17\n  | year = 1999\n  | place = Montreal\n}}</ref> after first considering the pros and cons of IS-IS in service provider environments.<ref>{{Cite conference\n  | first = Dave\n  | last = Katz\n  | title = OSPF and IS-IS: A Comparative Anatomy\n  | url = https://www.nanog.org/meetings/abstract?id=1084\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180620232619/https://www.nanog.org/meetings/abstract?id=1084\n  | archive-date = 2018-06-20\n  | conference = North American Network Operators Group NANOG 19\n  | year = 2000\n  | place = Albuquerque\n}}</ref>\n\nOSPF can provide better load-sharing on external links than other IGPs.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} When the default route to an ISP is injected into OSPF from multiple ASBRs as a Type I external route and the same external cost specified, other routers will go to the ASBR with the least path cost from its location. This can be tuned further by adjusting the external cost. If the default route from different ISPs is injected with different external costs, as a Type II external route, the lower-cost default becomes the primary exit and the higher-cost becomes the backup only.\n\nThe only real limiting factor that may compel major ISPs to select IS-IS over OSPF is if they have a network with more than 850 routers.{{Citation needed|reason=Is there some source of this number?

It was the initial post-colonial [[United States territory|Territory of the United States]] and encompassed most of pre-war British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|colonial territory]] west of the [[Appalachian mountains]] north of the [[Ohio River]]. It included all the land west of [[Pennsylvania]], northwest of the [[Ohio River]] and east of the [[Mississippi River]] below the [[Great Lakes]]. It spanned all or large parts of six eventual [[U.S. State]]s ([[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], and the northeastern part of [[Minnesota]]).  It was created as a Territory by the [[Northwest Ordinance]] July 13, 1787, reduced to Ohio, eastern Michigan and a sliver of southeastern Indiana with the formation of [[Indiana Territory]] July 4, 1800, and ceased to exist March 1, 1803, when the southeastern portion of the territory was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[Ohio|state of Ohio]], and the remainder attached to [[Indiana Territory]].\n\nAt its inception the Territory was a vast wilderness sparsely populated by Indians including the [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Potawatomi]], [[Shawnee]] and others; there were only a handful of French colonial settlements, and Clarksville at Falls of the Ohio. At the territory's dissolution, there were dozens of towns and settlements, a few with thousands of settlers, mostly in Ohio chiefly along the Ohio and Miami Rivers and around the Great Lakes.\n\nThe region was ceded to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris of 1783]].\nThe [[Congress of the Confederation]] enacted the [[Northwest Ordinance]] in 1787 to provide for the administration of the territories and set rules for admission of jurisdictions as states. On August 7, 1789, the new [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] affirmed the Ordinance with slight modifications under the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]].\n\nInitially, the Territory was governed by martial law under a governor and three judges, but as population increased, a legislature, the Territorial General Assembly, was formed. Administratively, the Territory was divided into a succession of counties, eventually totaling 13.\n\nConflicts between settlers and Native American inhabitants of the Territory resulted in the [[Northwest Indian War]] culminating in General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. The subsequent [[Treaty of Greenville]] 1795 opened the way for settlement of southern and western Ohio.\n\n==The territory==\nThe Northwest Territory included all the then-owned land of the United States west of [[Pennsylvania]], east of the [[Mississippi River]], and northwest of the [[Ohio River]]. It incorporated most of the former [[Ohio Country]] except a portion in western Pennsylvania, and eastern [[Illinois Country]]. It covered all of the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, as well as the northeastern part of Minnesota. Lands west of the Mississippi River were the [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana Province]] of New France (acquired by the United States in 1803 by the [[Louisiana Purchase]]); lands north of the [[Great Lakes]] were the British [[Province of Upper Canada]], and lands south of the Ohio River constituted [[Kentucky County, Virginia]], admitted to the union as the state of [[Kentucky]] in 1792. The area included more than {{convert|260000|mi2}} and comprised about 1/3 of the land area of the United States at the time of its creation. It was inhabited by about 45,000 Native Americans and 4,000 traders, mostly [[Canadien]] and British. Among the tribes inhabiting the region were the Shawnee, Delaware, Miami, Wyandot, Ottawa and Potawatomi. Notably, the Miami capital along with British trading posts was at Kekionga at the site of present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Neutralizing Kekionga became the focus of the Northwest Indian War, the driving events in the early evolution of the territory.\n[[File:United States land claims and cessions 1782-1802.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|The state cessions that eventually allowed for the creation of the territories north and southwest of the [[River Ohio]]]]\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2015}}\nIntegration of the Northwest Territory into a political unit, and settlement, depended on three factors: relinquishment by the British, extinguishment  of states' claims west of the Appalachians, and usurpation or purchase of lands from the Indians.  These objectives were accomplished correspondingly by the [[American Revolutionary War]], provisions in the [[Articles of Confederation]], and various treaties preceding the [[Northwest Indian War]] including [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)]] and [[Treaty of Fort McIntosh]] (1785).  The treaty process would extend well beyond the War and existence of the Territory as a political entity.\n\n===New France===\n{{Further|Beaver Wars}}\nEuropean exploration of the region began with [[French-Canadian]] voyageurs in the 17th century, followed by French missionaries and French fur traders. French-Canadian explorer [[Jean Nicolet]] was the first recorded European entrant into the region, landing in 1634 at the current site of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] (although [[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] is stated by some sources as having explored [[Lake Superior]] and possibly inland Wisconsin in 1622). The French exercised control from widely separate posts in the region, which they claimed as [[New France]]; among these was the post at [[Fort Detroit]], founded in 1701. France ceded the territory to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] as part of the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]] in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]], after being defeated in the [[French and Indian War]].\n\n===British control===\n{{See also|Illinois campaign}}\nFrom the 1750s to the peace treaty that ended the War of 1812, the British had a long-standing goal of creating an [[Indian barrier state]], a large \"neutral\" Indian state that would cover most of the Old Northwest. It would be independent of the United States and under the tutelage of the British, who would use it to block American expansion and to build up their control of the [[fur trade]] headquartered in Montreal.<ref>Dwight L. Smith, \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea,\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2\u20134 (1989): 46\u201363.</ref>\n\nA new colony, named [[Charlotina]], was proposed for the southern Great Lakes region. However, facing [[Pontiac's Rebellion|armed opposition]] by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], the British issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Proclamation of 1763]], which prohibited [[White American|white]] colonial settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. This action angered American colonists interested in expansion, as well as those who had already settled in the area. In 1774, by the [[Quebec Act]], Britain annexed the region to the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] in order to provide a civil government and to centralize British administration of the Montreal-based fur trade. The prohibition of settlement west of the Appalachians remained, contributing to the [[American Revolution]].\n\nIn February 1779, [[George Rogers Clark]] of the [[Virginia Militia]] [[Illinois campaign|captured Kaskaskia and Vincennes]] from British commander [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]]. Virginia capitalized on Clark's success by laying claim to the whole of the Old Northwest, calling it [[Illinois County]], Virginia,<ref>Palmer, pp. 400\u2013421.{{full citation needed|date= December 2013}}</ref> until 1784, when Virginia ceded its land claims to the federal government.\n\nBritain officially ceded the area north of the Ohio River and west of the Appalachians to the United States at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], but the British continued to maintain a presence in the region as late as 1815, the end of the [[War of 1812]].\n\n===Cessions by the states===\n{{main|State cessions}}\nSeveral states (Virginia, Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut) had competing claims on the territory: Virginia claimed all of what were formerly Illinois Country and Ohio Country; Massachusetts claimed what are today southern Michigan and Wisconsin; Connecticut claimed a narrow strip across the territory just south of the Great Lakes; New York claimed an elastic portion of Iroquis lands between Lake Erie and the Ohio River. The western boundary of Pennsylvania was also ill-defined. Virginia's jurisdiction was limited to a few French settlements at the extreme western edge of the territory. Massachusett's and Connecticut's claims were effectively lines on paper. New York had no colonial settlements or territorial government in the claimed lands.\n\nThe western border of Pennsylvania, previously assumed to run in a north by northeast zigzag, was resolved in 1780 by the Continental Congress. The Mason\u2013Dixon line was extended westward to a point five degrees of longitude (about 260 miles) from the Delaware River and the western boundary extended to run due north from the western-most extent of the Mason\u2013Dixon line to the 43rd parallel. This incorporated the eastern part of Ohio Country as western Pennsylvania, and set the eastern boundary of federal lands.\n\n\"Unlanded\" states, such as Maryland, refused to ratify the [[Articles of Confederation]] so long as these states were allowed to keep their western territory, fearing that those states could continue to grow and tip the balance of power in their favor under the proposed system of federal government. As a concession to obtain ratification, these states ceded their claims on the territory to the federal government: New York in 1780, Virginia in 1784, and Massachusetts and Connecticut in 1785. So the majority of the territory became public land owned by the U.S. government. Virginia and Connecticut reserved two areas to use as compensation to military veterans: The [[Virginia Military District]]<ref>Virginia ceded to the United States its claim to undeeded land in the VMC on Dec. 8, 1852. In 1871, Congress ceded this land to the state.</ref> and the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]]<ref>In 1800, Connecticut ceded its Western Reserve claims to the Northwest Territory, and it came under the sovereignty of Ohio in 1803.</ref>\n\nThomas Jefferson's [[Land Ordinance of 1784]] was the first organization of the territory by the United States; it provided a process for dividing the territory into individual states.  The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established a [[Public Land Survey System|standardized system for surveying the land]] into saleable lots, although Ohio would be partially surveyed several times using different methods, resulting in a patchwork of land surveys in Ohio. Some older French communities' property claims based on earlier systems of long, narrow lots also were retained. The rest of the Northwest Territory was divided into roughly uniform square townships and sections, which facilitated land sales and development. The ordinance also stipulated that the territory would eventually form at least three but not more than five new states.<ref>{{cite book |last=Calloway |first=Colin G. |year=2015 |title=The Victory with No Name. The Native American Defeat of the First American Army |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=50}}</ref>\n\n===Founding of the territory===\nUnder the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, which created the Northwest Territory, General St. Clair was appointed governor. When the territory was divided in 1800, he briefly served as governor of the Northwest Territory remnant that included Ohio, the eastern half of Michigan, and a sliver of southeastern Indiana called \"The Gore.\"\n\nSt. Clair formally established the government on July 15, 1788, at [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]]. In 1790, he renamed the settlement of Losantiville [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], after the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], and moved the administrative and military center to [[Fort Washington (Ohio)|Fort Washington]].\n\nAs Governor, he formulated the [[Maxwell's Code]] (named after its printer, [[William Maxwell (engraver)|William Maxwell]]), the first written criminal and civil laws of the territory. Maxwell's Code consisted of thirty-seven different laws with the stipulation that the laws had to have been passed previously in one of the original thirteen states. The laws restructured the court system then in effect in the Northwest Territory. They also protected residents against excessive taxes and declared that English common law would be the basis of legal decisions and laws in the Northwest Territory.\n\n[[File:ST.CLAIR, Arthur (signed check).jpg|thumb|Check signed by [[Arthur St. Clair]] while governor of the Northwest Territory (1796)]]\n\n===Northwest Indian War===\n{{Main|Northwest Indian War}}\n{{Further|Western Confederacy|Harmar Campaign|Big Bottom massacre|St. Clair's Defeat|Legion of the United States|Siege of Fort Recovery|Battle of Fallen Timbers|Treaty of Greenville}}\nThe young United States government, deeply in debt following the Revolutionary War and lacking authority to tax under the [[Articles of Confederation]], planned to raise revenue from the methodical sale of land in the Northwest Territory. This plan necessarily called for the removal of both Native American villages and squatters from lands west of Appalachia, loosely, the territory called \"Ohio Country\" and beyond.<ref>{{cite book |last=Calloway |first=Colin G. |year=2015 |title=The Victory with No Name.

In 1789, he succeeded in getting certain Indians to sign the [[Treaty of Fort Harmar]], but many native leaders had not been invited to participate in the negotiations or had refused to do so. Rather than settling the Indians' claims, the treaty provoked an escalation of the  \"[[Northwest Indian War]]\" (or \"Little Turtle's War\"). Mutual hostilities led to a campaign by General [[Josiah Harmar]], whose 1,500 militiamen were [[Harmar Campaign|defeated]] by the Indians in October 1790.<ref>Michael S.

He led a [[punitive expedition]] involving two Regular Army regiments and some militia. In October 1791 as an advance post for his campaign, [[Fort Jefferson (Ohio)]], was built under his direction. Located in present-day [[Darke County]] in far western Ohio, the fort was built of wood and intended primarily as a supply depot; accordingly, it was originally named Fort Deposit. One month later, near modern-day [[Fort Recovery]], his force advanced to the location of Indian settlements near the headwaters of the [[Wabash River]], but on November 4 they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by [[Miami tribe|Miami]] Chief [[Little Turtle]] and Shawnee chief [[Blue Jacket]]. More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle, known as \"[[St. Clair's Defeat]]\" and many other names. It remains the greatest defeat of a US Army by Native Americans in history, with about 623 American soldiers killed in action and about 50 Native American killed. Although an investigation exonerated him, St. Clair resigned his army commission in March 1792 at the request of President Washington, but continued to serve as Governor of the Northwest Territory.<ref>Leroy V.

Wayne was commissioned to form a new army of 5120 professional soldiers, dubbed the \"Legion of the United States\". Wayne recruited and trained his army in Pennsylvania, and moved them to southwestern Ohio in fall of 1793. There they were joined by the Kentucky Militia under Major General [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]]. Over the next ten months, the armies marched north up the Great Miami and Maumee River valleys toward the Miami capital of Kekionga. Along the way Wayne's legion built a series of outpost forts including Fort Greene Ville, Fort Recovery and Fort Defiance. Fierce battles occurred around some of these but none of Wayne's forts were ever taken by the Indians. \n{{missing info|siege of Fort Recovery summer 1794|date=January 2019}}\nIn mid 1794, the British built [[Fort Miami (Ohio)|Fort Miamis]] near what is today Toledo, Ohio, to forestall Wayne's putative advance on the British stronghold at Detroit. The final battle of Wayne's campaign occurred within the scope of this fort. The military campaign of Gen. Wayne against the Western Confederacy, who were supported by a British company, culminated with victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. Following the battle, in fall 1794, Wayne's army marched unopposed to Kekionga where they constructed Fort Wayne, a defiant symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country.\n\n[[Jay's Treaty]], in 1794, temporarily helped to smooth relations with British traders in the region, where British citizens outnumbered American citizens throughout the 1790s. The following year, the [[Treaty of Greenville]] secured peace on the western frontier and opened most of southern and eastern Ohio for settlement.\n\n===Settlement===\n{{Further|Vincennes Tract|Clark's Grant|Symmes Purchase|Ohio Company|Connecticut Land Company|Purchase on the Muskingum|Seven Ranges}}\n\nSporadic westward emigrant settlements had already resumed late in the war{{which|date=December 2018}} after the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]'s power was broken and the tribes scattered by the 1779 [[Sullivan Expedition]]. Soon after the Revolution ended, land-hungry migrants started moving west. A gateway trading post developed as the town of [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], which was a key outfitting center west of the mountains. Other wagon roads, such as the [[Kittanning Path]] surmounting the [[gaps of the Allegheny]] in central Pennsylvania, or trails along the [[Mohawk River]] in New York, enabled a steady stream of settlers to reach the near west and the lands bordering the Mississippi.{{efn|Before the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]], the western border of U.S. territory ended on the Mississippi; the lands beyond still being a possession of Napoleonic France or the [[Kingdom of Spain]].}} This activity stimulated the development of the eastern parts of the eventual [[National Road]] by private investors. The [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland&ndash;Brownsville]] toll road linked the water routes of the [[Potomac River]] with the [[Monongahela River]] of the Ohio/Mississippi riverine systems in the days when water travel was the only good alternative to walking and riding. Most of the territory and its successors was settled by emigrants passing through the [[Cumberland Narrows]], or along the [[Mohawk Valley region|Mohawk Valley]] in New York State.\n\nThe Continental Congress' title to the lands north of the Ohio River was derived from the Treaty of Paris (1783), the Treaty of Fort McIntosh, and the cessions of four states.  Settlement was through several means: squatters, direct U.S. government land sales to settlers, sales of tracts of land to land companies, and state sales of land to veterans in the Virginia Military District and Connecticut Western Reserve.  The first area to be surveyed was the [[Seven Ranges]] along the eastern border of Ohio in 1786\u20131789.  Direct sales of federal lands to individual homesteaders started here.  In some cases, the government granted or donated land for special purposes.\n\nSettlement followed the forts, whether garrisoned or not.  Lack of a garrison meant that threat of Indian attack had become negligible.  This was true everywhere in Ohio before 1800 except the northwest sector above the Greenville Treaty line. It became true in Indiana after the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811; by 1813 Battle of the Thames where Tecumseh was defeated and killed, the frontier had essentially moved to west of the Mississippi.  The first U.S. military garrisons in the territory were Fort Patrick Henry, Vincennes, Indiana (1779), Fort Clark at Falls of the Ohio, Indiana (1783), and Fort Harmar in Ohio (1785).  The first settlements were at these locations.\n\nThe [[Clark's Grant|first land grant]] was to George Rogers Clark in 1781 at Falls of the Ohio on the Indiana side; he went on to found the settlement of Clarksville. The first two land purchases were large tracts of land sold to John Symmes ([[Symmes Purchase]]) in 1788 and two tracts sold to Ohio Company in 1787 and 1792 ([[Purchase on the Muskingum]]). Settlement of these areas was spearheaded by Losantiville and Marietta, respectively. In 1792, Congress [[Donation Tract|donated 100,000 acres]] to Ohio Company as a buffer zone against Indian incursion around the settled area. The vexing land claims by inhabitants of the old French Vincennes Tract were finally resolved by what was dubbed the 'Vincennes donation lands' embodied in a federal land act of 1791. Federal land sales in Indiana (then a part of Indiana Territory starting in 1800) didn't begin until 1801, through the Cincinnati land office.\n\nAccording to the 1800 Census of the United States, the Northwest Territory (i.e. the pending state of Ohio) had a population, excluding Indians, of over 45,000, and Indiana Territory, a population of about 5,600.  By the time of Ohio statehood, there were as many as 50 named towns in Northwest and Indiana Territories, a few, like Vincennes, with thousands of settlers, and dozens of unnamed settlements below the Treaty Line in Ohio.\n\nFollowing settlement of the frontier, the great wave of colonial immigration flowed westward, founding the great cities of the eventual 6 states of the Territory which is now the midwestern United States  early in the 19th century: Detroit (<1800), Columbus (1812), Indianapolis (1822),  Chicago (1833), Milwaukee (1846), Minneapolis (1847).\n\n===Statehood for Ohio===\nA [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]], St. Clair hoped to see two states made of the Ohio Territory to increase Federalist power in [[United States Congress|Congress]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} However, he was resented by Ohio Democratic-Republicans for what was perceived as his partisanship, high-handedness and arrogance in office.  In 1802, his opposition to plans for Ohio statehood led President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to remove him from office as territorial governor.  He thus played no part in the organizing of the state of [[Ohio]] in 1803.  The first [[Ohio Constitution]] provided for a weak governor and a strong [[legislature]], in part a reaction to St. Clair's method of governance.\n\nOn July 4, 1800, in preparation for Ohio's statehood, the [[Indiana Territory]] was decreed by an act of the U.S. Congress,<ref>An ACT to divide the territory of the United States north-west of the Ohio, into two separate governments</ref> signed into law by [[John Adams|President John Adams]] on May 7, 1800, effective on July 4. The Congressional legislation encompassed all land west of the present Indiana\u2013Ohio border and its northward extension to [[Lake Superior]], reducing the Northwest Territory to present-day Ohio and the eastern half of Michigan's [[Lower Peninsula]]. The [[Enabling Act of 1802]] authorized creation of the state of Ohio from the remainder of the Northwest Territory. Ohio was admitted as the 17th state on March 1, 1803. A few days later, the residual land was annexed to [[Indiana Territory]], and the Northwest Territory went out of existence. Ongoing disputes with the British over the region were a contributing factor to the War of 1812. Britain irrevocably ceded claim to the former Northwest Territory with the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814.\n\n{{Further|Indiana Territory|History of Ohio}}\n\n==Northwest Ordinance==\n{{Main|Northwest Ordinance}}\n\nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the Northwest Territory, and defined its boundaries, form of government, and administrative structure.  In particular, it defined the bodies of government, established the legal basis of land ownership, provided for abolition and transfer of state territorial claims, made rules for admission of new states, established public education, recognized and codified 'natural rights', prohibited slavery, and defined the land rights and applicability of laws to the Indians.\n\n===Law and government===\n[[File:United States 1789-08-1790-04.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Map of the states and territories of the United States as it was on August 7, 1789, when the Northwest Territory was first organized, to April 2, 1790, when the future [[Southwest Territory]] was ceded by North Carolina]]\nAt first, the [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] had a modified form of [[martial law]]. The governor was also the senior army [[Commissioned officer|officer]] within the territory, and he combined [[legislative]] and [[executive branch|executive authority]]. But a [[supreme court]] was established, and he shared legislative powers with the [[court]].

[[Washington County, Ohio|Washington County]] was the first of these, at [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] in 1788. This was an important event, as this court was the first establishment of civil and criminal law in the pioneer country.\n\nAs soon as the number of free male [[settler]]s exceeded 5,000, the territorial legislature was to be created, and this happened in 1798. The full mechanisms of government were put in place, as outlined in the [[Northwest Ordinance]]. A [[bicameral legislature]] consisted of a [[State legislature (United States)|House of Representatives]] and a Council. The first House had 22 [[Legislator|representatives]], apportioned by population of each county.<ref name=ohio1917>{{cite book |title= Manual of Legislative Practice in the General Assembly |author= Ohio General Assembly |page= 199 |year= 1917 |publisher= State of Ohio |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7qesAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA199|author-link= Ohio General Assembly }}</ref> The House then nominated 10 citizens to be Council members.

Early settlements were outside or nearby forts: Clarksville, Vincennes, Kaskaskia (French), Losantiville, and the Ohio Company settlements at Marietta and Waterford/Beverly. Later, after the Treaty of Greenville, settlements no longer needed to be spearheaded by forts, and sprang up everywhere simultaneously below the Treaty Line. There were dozens of unnamed settlements in addition to these. Michigan forts and settlements belonged to the British until 1796; Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota were wilderness and Indian lands.\n\n[[File:USPostRoadMap1796.jpg|right|thumb|[[Abraham Bradley Jr.|Abraham Bradley's]] 1796 map of the United States includes many forts and settlements within the Northwest Territory.]]\n*[[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]], Illinois, 1778\n*Fort Gage/[[Kaskaskia, Illinois]], 1779, an American/French settlement\n*[[Fort Patrick Henry]]/Vincennes, Indiana 1779\n*[[Fort Nelson (Kentucky)|Fort Nelson]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Falls of the Ohio]], 1781\n*[[Clarksville, Indiana]], 1783 (Louisville, KY, also grew out of this settlement)\n*[[Fort Finney (Ohio)|Fort Finney]], Ohio, 1785, moved to Fort Finney, Indiana, 1786\n*[[Fort Harmar]], Ohio, 1785\n*[[Fort Finney (Indiana)|Fort Finney]]/Jeffersonville, Indiana, 1786\n*[[Fort Steuben]], Ohio, Jan. 1787, abandoned May 1787\n*[[Marietta, Ohio]], July, 1788\n*[[Columbia-Tusculum, Cincinnati|Columbia, Ohio]], Nov. 1788\n*Losantiville ([[Cincinnati]]), Ohio, Dec. 1788\n*[[North Bend, Ohio]], Feb., 1789\n*[[Waterford, Ohio|Waterford]] and [[Beverly, Ohio|Beverly]], Ohio, spring, 1789\n*[[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]], Ohio, summer, 1789 (later, Newport Barracks, Louisville, Kentucky)\n*[[Manchester, Ohio|Massie's Station]], Virginia Military District, 1790, renamed Manchester\n*Fort Dilles, Ohio, 1790, later called [[Dilles Bottom, Ohio|Dilles Bottom]]\n*[[Gallipolis]], Ohio, Oct. 1790\n*[[Stockport, Ohio|Big Bottom]], Ohio, Dec. 1790 (squatter settlement, site of [[Big Bottom Massacre]] in 1791)\n*[[Fort Frye]], Ohio, Jan.\u2013Feb. 1791 (not a U.S. military garrison)\n*[[Hamilton, Ohio#History|Fort Hamilton]], Ohio, September 1791\n*[[Fort Jefferson (Ohio)|Fort Jefferson]], Ohio, October 1791  (originally Fort Deposit)\n*[[Fort St. Clair]], Ohio, 1792\n*[[Fort Greene Ville]], Ohio, Nov. 1793\n*[[Fort Recovery]], Ohio, Dec. 1793 \u2013 Mar. 1794\n*[[Fort Adams (Ohio)|Fort Adams]], Ohio, August 1794\n*[[Fort Massac]], Illinois, Jun. \u2013 Oct. 1794\n*[[Fort Defiance (Ohio)|Fort Defiance]], Ohio, August 1794\n(Battle of Fallen Timbers, Aug. 1794)\n*Fort Deposit, Ohio, Sept. \u2013 Oct., 1794\n*[[Fort Wayne (fort)|Fort Wayne]], Indiana, October 1794\n*[[Fort Loramie, Ohio#History|Fort Loramie]] (or Laramie), Ohio, winter 1794/95\n*[[Piqua, Ohio#History|Fort Piqua]], Ohio, winter 1794/95\n*Fort St. Mary's, Ohio, Oct. 1795\n*Jefferson, 1795, now [[Martins Ferry, Ohio|Martins Ferry]]\n*[[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]], Ohio, 1796\n*[[Cleveland]], Connecticut Western Reserve, 1796\n*[[Fort Miami (Ohio)|Fort Miami]], Ohio, ceded to U.S. 1796\n*[[Fort Lernoult]] (previously [[Fort Detroit]]), Michigan, ceded to U.S. 1796\n*[[Fort Mackinac]], Michigan, ceded to U.S. 1796\n*[[Williamsburg, Ohio]], 1796\n*[[Dayton, Ohio]], 1796\n*Newellstown, Ohio, 1796, renamed [[St. Clairsville, Ohio|St. Clairsville]]\n*[[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]] Ohio, 1797\n*[[Athens, Ohio|Athens]], Ohio, 1797\n*[[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]], Ohio, 1797\n*[[Warren, Ohio]], 1798\n*[[Bethel, Ohio]], 1798\n*[[Zanesville, Ohio]], 1799\n*[[Lancaster, Ohio]], 1800\n*[[Springfield, Ohio]], 1801\n*[[Youngstown, Ohio]], 1802\n*[[Coshocton, Ohio]], 1802\n*[[Lawrenceburg, Indiana]], 1802 (the Gore, part of Ohio until 1803)\n*New Lisbon, Ohio, 1803, later renamed [[Lisbon, Ohio|Lisbon]]\n*[[Xenia, Ohio]], 1803\n*[[Mentor, Ohio]], after 1800\nSettlements in states other than Ohio after 1800 are part of the History of Indiana Territory.\n\n==Territorial counties==\n[[File:MELIOREM LAPSA LOCAVIT.JPG|thumb|Seal of the Northwest Territory over a time capsule outside the [[Campus Martius Museum]].

It was the initial post-colonial [[United States territory|Territory of the United States]] and encompassed most of pre-war British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|colonial territory]] west of the [[Appalachian mountains]] north of the [[Ohio River]]. It included all the land west of [[Pennsylvania]], northwest of the [[Ohio River]] and east of the [[Mississippi River]] below the [[Great Lakes]]. It spanned all or large parts of six eventual [[U.S. State]]s ([[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], and the northeastern part of [[Minnesota]]).  It was created as a Territory by the [[Northwest Ordinance]] July 13, 1787, reduced to Ohio, eastern Michigan and a sliver of southeastern Indiana with the formation of [[Indiana Territory]] July 4, 1800, and ceased to exist March 1, 1803, when the southeastern portion of the territory was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[Ohio|state of Ohio]], and the remainder attached to [[Indiana Territory]].\n\nAt its inception the Territory was a vast wilderness sparsely populated by Indians including the [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Potawatomi]], [[Shawnee]] and others; there were only a handful of French colonial settlements, and Clarksville at Falls of the Ohio. At the territory's dissolution, there were dozens of towns and settlements, a few with thousands of settlers, mostly in Ohio chiefly along the Ohio and Miami Rivers and around the Great Lakes.\n\nThe region was ceded to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris of 1783]].\nThe [[Congress of the Confederation]] enacted the [[Northwest Ordinance]] in 1787 to provide for the administration of the territories and set rules for admission of jurisdictions as states. On August 7, 1789, the new [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] affirmed the Ordinance with slight modifications under the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]].\n\nInitially, the Territory was governed by martial law under a governor and three judges, but as population increased, a legislature, the Territorial General Assembly, was formed. Administratively, the Territory was divided into a succession of counties, eventually totaling 13.\n\nConflicts between settlers and Native American inhabitants of the Territory resulted in the [[Northwest Indian War]] culminating in General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. The subsequent [[Treaty of Greenville]] 1795 opened the way for settlement of southern and western Ohio.\n\n==The territory==\nThe Northwest Territory included all the then-owned land of the United States west of [[Pennsylvania]], east of the [[Mississippi River]], and northwest of the [[Ohio River]]. It incorporated most of the former [[Ohio Country]] except a portion in western Pennsylvania, and eastern [[Illinois Country]]. It covered all of the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, as well as the northeastern part of Minnesota. Lands west of the Mississippi River were the [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana Province]] of New France (acquired by the United States in 1803 by the [[Louisiana Purchase]]); lands north of the [[Great Lakes]] were the British [[Province of Upper Canada]], and lands south of the Ohio River constituted [[Kentucky County, Virginia]], admitted to the union as the state of [[Kentucky]] in 1792. The area included more than {{convert|260000|mi2}} and comprised about 1/3 of the land area of the United States at the time of its creation. It was inhabited by about 45,000 Native Americans and 4,000 traders, mostly [[Canadien]] and British. Among the tribes inhabiting the region were the Shawnee, Delaware, Miami, Wyandot, Ottawa and Potawatomi. Notably, the Miami capital along with British trading posts was at Kekionga at the site of present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Neutralizing Kekionga became the focus of the Northwest Indian War, the driving events in the early evolution of the territory.\n[[File:United States land claims and cessions 1782-1802.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|The state cessions that eventually allowed for the creation of the territories north and southwest of the [[River Ohio]]]]\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2015}}\nIntegration of the Northwest Territory into a political unit, and settlement, depended on three factors: relinquishment by the British, extinguishment  of states' claims west of the Appalachians, and usurpation or purchase of lands from the Indians.  These objectives were accomplished correspondingly by the [[American Revolutionary War]], provisions in the [[Articles of Confederation]], and various treaties preceding the [[Northwest Indian War]] including [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)]] and [[Treaty of Fort McIntosh]] (1785).  The treaty process would extend well beyond the War and existence of the Territory as a political entity.\n\n===New France===\n{{Further|Beaver Wars}}\nEuropean exploration of the region began with [[French-Canadian]] voyageurs in the 17th century, followed by French missionaries and French fur traders. French-Canadian explorer [[Jean Nicolet]] was the first recorded European entrant into the region, landing in 1634 at the current site of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] (although [[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] is stated by some sources as having explored [[Lake Superior]] and possibly inland Wisconsin in 1622). The French exercised control from widely separate posts in the region, which they claimed as [[New France]]; among these was the post at [[Fort Detroit]], founded in 1701. France ceded the territory to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] as part of the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]] in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]], after being defeated in the [[French and Indian War]].\n\n===British control===\n{{See also|Illinois campaign}}\nFrom the 1750s to the peace treaty that ended the War of 1812, the British had a long-standing goal of creating an [[Indian barrier state]], a large \"neutral\" Indian state that would cover most of the Old Northwest. It would be independent of the United States and under the tutelage of the British, who would use it to block American expansion and to build up their control of the [[fur trade]] headquartered in Montreal.<ref>Dwight L. Smith, \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea,\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2\u20134 (1989): 46\u201363.</ref>\n\nA new colony, named [[Charlotina]], was proposed for the southern Great Lakes region. However, facing [[Pontiac's Rebellion|armed opposition]] by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], the British issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Proclamation of 1763]], which prohibited [[White American|white]] colonial settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. This action angered American colonists interested in expansion, as well as those who had already settled in the area. In 1774, by the [[Quebec Act]], Britain annexed the region to the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] in order to provide a civil government and to centralize British administration of the Montreal-based fur trade. The prohibition of settlement west of the Appalachians remained, contributing to the [[American Revolution]].\n\nIn February 1779, [[George Rogers Clark]] of the [[Virginia Militia]] [[Illinois campaign|captured Kaskaskia and Vincennes]] from British commander [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]]. Virginia capitalized on Clark's success by laying claim to the whole of the Old Northwest, calling it [[Illinois County]], Virginia,<ref>Palmer, pp. 400\u2013421.{{full citation needed|date= December 2013}}</ref> until 1784, when Virginia ceded its land claims to the federal government.\n\nBritain officially ceded the area north of the Ohio River and west of the Appalachians to the United States at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], but the British continued to maintain a presence in the region as late as 1815, the end of the [[War of 1812]].\n\n===Cessions by the states===\n{{main|State cessions}}\nSeveral states (Virginia, Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut) had competing claims on the territory: Virginia claimed all of what were formerly Illinois Country and Ohio Country; Massachusetts claimed what are today southern Michigan and Wisconsin; Connecticut claimed a narrow strip across the territory just south of the Great Lakes; New York claimed an elastic portion of Iroquis lands between Lake Erie and the Ohio River. The western boundary of Pennsylvania was also ill-defined. Virginia's jurisdiction was limited to a few French settlements at the extreme western edge of the territory. Massachusett's and Connecticut's claims were effectively lines on paper. New York had no colonial settlements or territorial government in the claimed lands.\n\nThe western border of Pennsylvania, previously assumed to run in a north by northeast zigzag, was resolved in 1780 by the Continental Congress. The Mason\u2013Dixon line was extended westward to a point five degrees of longitude (about 260 miles) from the Delaware River and the western boundary extended to run due north from the western-most extent of the Mason\u2013Dixon line to the 43rd parallel. This incorporated the eastern part of Ohio Country as western Pennsylvania, and set the eastern boundary of federal lands.\n\n\"Unlanded\" states, such as Maryland, refused to ratify the [[Articles of Confederation]] so long as these states were allowed to keep their western territory, fearing that those states could continue to grow and tip the balance of power in their favor under the proposed system of federal government. As a concession to obtain ratification, these states ceded their claims on the territory to the federal government: New York in 1780, Virginia in 1784, and Massachusetts and Connecticut in 1785. So the majority of the territory became public land owned by the U.S. government. Virginia and Connecticut reserved two areas to use as compensation to military veterans: The [[Virginia Military District]]<ref>Virginia ceded to the United States its claim to undeeded land in the VMC on Dec. 8, 1852. In 1871, Congress ceded this land to the state.</ref> and the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]]<ref>In 1800, Connecticut ceded its Western Reserve claims to the Northwest Territory, and it came under the sovereignty of Ohio in 1803.</ref>\n\nThomas Jefferson's [[Land Ordinance of 1784]] was the first organization of the territory by the United States; it provided a process for dividing the territory into individual states.  The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established a [[Public Land Survey System|standardized system for surveying the land]] into saleable lots, although Ohio would be partially surveyed several times using different methods, resulting in a patchwork of land surveys in Ohio. Some older French communities' property claims based on earlier systems of long, narrow lots also were retained. The rest of the Northwest Territory was divided into roughly uniform square townships and sections, which facilitated land sales and development. The ordinance also stipulated that the territory would eventually form at least three but not more than five new states.<ref>{{cite book |last=Calloway |first=Colin G. |year=2015 |title=The Victory with No Name. The Native American Defeat of the First American Army |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=50}}</ref>\n\n===Founding of the territory===\nUnder the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, which created the Northwest Territory, General St. Clair was appointed governor. When the territory was divided in 1800, he briefly served as governor of the Northwest Territory remnant that included Ohio, the eastern half of Michigan, and a sliver of southeastern Indiana called \"The Gore.\"\n\nSt. Clair formally established the government on July 15, 1788, at [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]]. In 1790, he renamed the settlement of Losantiville [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], after the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], and moved the administrative and military center to [[Fort Washington (Ohio)|Fort Washington]].\n\nAs Governor, he formulated the [[Maxwell's Code]] (named after its printer, [[William Maxwell (engraver)|William Maxwell]]), the first written criminal and civil laws of the territory. Maxwell's Code consisted of thirty-seven different laws with the stipulation that the laws had to have been passed previously in one of the original thirteen states. The laws restructured the court system then in effect in the Northwest Territory. They also protected residents against excessive taxes and declared that English common law would be the basis of legal decisions and laws in the Northwest Territory.\n\n[[File:ST.CLAIR, Arthur (signed check).jpg|thumb|Check signed by [[Arthur St. Clair]] while governor of the Northwest Territory (1796)]]\n\n===Northwest Indian War===\n{{Main|Northwest Indian War}}\n{{Further|Western Confederacy|Harmar Campaign|Big Bottom massacre|St. Clair's Defeat|Legion of the United States|Siege of Fort Recovery|Battle of Fallen Timbers|Treaty of Greenville}}\nThe young United States government, deeply in debt following the Revolutionary War and lacking authority to tax under the [[Articles of Confederation]], planned to raise revenue from the methodical sale of land in the Northwest Territory.

In 1789, he succeeded in getting certain Indians to sign the [[Treaty of Fort Harmar]], but many native leaders had not been invited to participate in the negotiations or had refused to do so. Rather than settling the Indians' claims, the treaty provoked an escalation of the  \"[[Northwest Indian War]]\" (or \"Little Turtle's War\"). Mutual hostilities led to a campaign by General [[Josiah Harmar]], whose 1,500 militiamen were [[Harmar Campaign|defeated]] by the Indians in October 1790.<ref>Michael S.

He led a [[punitive expedition]] involving two Regular Army regiments and some militia. In October 1791 as an advance post for his campaign, [[Fort Jefferson (Ohio)]], was built under his direction. Located in present-day [[Darke County]] in far western Ohio, the fort was built of wood and intended primarily as a supply depot; accordingly, it was originally named Fort Deposit. One month later, near modern-day [[Fort Recovery]], his force advanced to the location of Indian settlements near the headwaters of the [[Wabash River]], but on November 4 they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by [[Miami tribe|Miami]] Chief [[Little Turtle]] and Shawnee chief [[Blue Jacket]]. More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle, known as \"[[St. Clair's Defeat]]\" and many other names. It remains the greatest defeat of a US Army by Native Americans in history, with about 623 American soldiers killed in action and about 50 Native American killed. Although an investigation exonerated him, St. Clair resigned his army commission in March 1792 at the request of President Washington, but continued to serve as Governor of the Northwest Territory.<ref>Leroy V.

Wayne was commissioned to form a new army of 5120 professional soldiers, dubbed the \"Legion of the United States\". Wayne recruited and trained his army in Pennsylvania, and moved them to southwestern Ohio in fall of 1793. There they were joined by the Kentucky Militia under Major General [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]]. Over the next ten months, the armies marched north up the Great Miami and Maumee River valleys toward the Miami capital of Kekionga. Along the way Wayne's legion built a series of outpost forts including Fort Greene Ville, Fort Recovery and Fort Defiance. Fierce battles occurred around some of these but none of Wayne's forts were ever taken by the Indians. \n{{missing info|siege of Fort Recovery summer 1794|date=January 2019}}\nIn mid 1794, the British built [[Fort Miamis]] near what is today Toledo, Ohio, to forestall Wayne's putative advance on the British stronghold at Detroit. The final battle of Wayne's campaign occurred within the scope of this fort. The military campaign of Gen. Wayne against the Western Confederacy, who were supported by a British company, culminated with victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. Following the battle, in fall 1794, Wayne's army marched unopposed to Kekionga where they constructed Fort Wayne, a defiant symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country.\n\n[[Jay's Treaty]], in 1794, temporarily helped to smooth relations with British traders in the region, where British citizens outnumbered American citizens throughout the 1790s. The following year, the [[Treaty of Greenville]] secured peace on the western frontier and opened most of southern and eastern Ohio for settlement.\n\n===Settlement===\n{{Further|Vincennes Tract|Clark's Grant|Symmes Purchase|Ohio Company|Connecticut Land Company|Purchase on the Muskingum|Seven Ranges}}\n\nSporadic westward emigrant settlements had already resumed late in the war{{which|date=December 2018}} after the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]'s power was broken and the tribes scattered by the 1779 [[Sullivan Expedition]]. Soon after the Revolution ended, land-hungry migrants started moving west. A gateway trading post developed as the town of [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], which was a key outfitting center west of the mountains. Other wagon roads, such as the [[Kittanning Path]] surmounting the [[gaps of the Allegheny]] in central Pennsylvania, or trails along the [[Mohawk River]] in New York, enabled a steady stream of settlers to reach the near west and the lands bordering the Mississippi.{{efn|Before the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]], the western border of U.S. territory ended on the Mississippi; the lands beyond still being a possession of Napoleonic France or the [[Kingdom of Spain]].}} This activity stimulated the development of the eastern parts of the eventual [[National Road]] by private investors. The [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland&ndash;Brownsville]] toll road linked the water routes of the [[Potomac River]] with the [[Monongahela River]] of the Ohio/Mississippi riverine systems in the days when water travel was the only good alternative to walking and riding. Most of the territory and its successors was settled by emigrants passing through the [[Cumberland Narrows]], or along the [[Mohawk Valley region|Mohawk Valley]] in New York State.\n\nThe Continental Congress' title to the lands north of the Ohio River was derived from the Treaty of Paris (1783), the Treaty of Fort McIntosh, and the cessions of four states.  Settlement was through several means: squatters, direct U.S. government land sales to settlers, sales of tracts of land to land companies, and state sales of land to veterans in the Virginia Military District and Connecticut Western Reserve.  The first area to be surveyed was the [[Seven Ranges]] along the eastern border of Ohio in 1786\u20131789.  Direct sales of federal lands to individual homesteaders started here.  In some cases, the government granted or donated land for special purposes.\n\nSettlement followed the forts, whether garrisoned or not.  Lack of a garrison meant that threat of Indian attack had become negligible.  This was true everywhere in Ohio before 1800 except the northwest sector above the Greenville Treaty line. It became true in Indiana after the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811; by 1813 Battle of the Thames where Tecumseh was defeated and killed, the frontier had essentially moved to west of the Mississippi.  The first U.S. military garrisons in the territory were Fort Patrick Henry, Vincennes, Indiana (1779), Fort Clark at Falls of the Ohio, Indiana (1783), and Fort Harmar in Ohio (1785).  The first settlements were at these locations.\n\nThe [[Clark's Grant|first land grant]] was to George Rogers Clark in 1781 at Falls of the Ohio on the Indiana side; he went on to found the settlement of Clarksville. The first two land purchases were large tracts of land sold to John Symmes ([[Symmes Purchase]]) in 1788 and two tracts sold to Ohio Company in 1787 and 1792 ([[Purchase on the Muskingum]]). Settlement of these areas was spearheaded by Losantiville and Marietta, respectively. In 1792, Congress [[Donation Tract|donated 100,000 acres]] to Ohio Company as a buffer zone against Indian incursion around the settled area. The vexing land claims by inhabitants of the old French Vincennes Tract were finally resolved by what was dubbed the 'Vincennes donation lands' embodied in a federal land act of 1791. Federal land sales in Indiana (then a part of Indiana Territory starting in 1800) didn't begin until 1801, through the Cincinnati land office.\n\nAccording to the 1800 Census of the United States, the Northwest Territory (i.e. the pending state of Ohio) had a population, excluding Indians, of over 45,000, and Indiana Territory, a population of about 5,600.  By the time of Ohio statehood, there were as many as 50 named towns in Northwest and Indiana Territories, a few, like Vincennes, with thousands of settlers, and dozens of unnamed settlements below the Treaty Line in Ohio.\n\nFollowing settlement of the frontier, the great wave of colonial immigration flowed westward, founding the great cities of the eventual 6 states of the Territory which is now the midwestern United States  early in the 19th century: Detroit (<1800), Columbus (1812), Indianapolis (1822),  Chicago (1833), Milwaukee (1846), Minneapolis (1847).\n\n===Statehood for Ohio===\nA [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]], St. Clair hoped to see two states made of the Ohio Territory to increase Federalist power in [[United States Congress|Congress]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} However, he was resented by Ohio Democratic-Republicans for what was perceived as his partisanship, high-handedness and arrogance in office.  In 1802, his opposition to plans for Ohio statehood led President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to remove him from office as territorial governor.  He thus played no part in the organizing of the state of [[Ohio]] in 1803.  The first [[Ohio Constitution]] provided for a weak governor and a strong [[legislature]], in part a reaction to St. Clair's method of governance.\n\nOn July 4, 1800, in preparation for Ohio's statehood, the [[Indiana Territory]] was decreed by an act of the U.S. Congress,<ref>An ACT to divide the territory of the United States north-west of the Ohio, into two separate governments</ref> signed into law by [[John Adams|President John Adams]] on May 7, 1800, effective on July 4. The Congressional legislation encompassed all land west of the present Indiana\u2013Ohio border and its northward extension to [[Lake Superior]], reducing the Northwest Territory to present-day Ohio and the eastern half of Michigan's [[Lower Peninsula]]. The [[Enabling Act of 1802]] authorized creation of the state of Ohio from the remainder of the Northwest Territory. Ohio was admitted as the 17th state on March 1, 1803. A few days later, the residual land was annexed to [[Indiana Territory]], and the Northwest Territory went out of existence. Ongoing disputes with the British over the region were a contributing factor to the War of 1812. Britain irrevocably ceded claim to the former Northwest Territory with the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814.\n\n{{Further|Indiana Territory|History of Ohio}}\n\n==Northwest Ordinance==\n{{Main|Northwest Ordinance}}\n\nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the Northwest Territory, and defined its boundaries, form of government, and administrative structure.  In particular, it defined the bodies of government, established the legal basis of land ownership, provided for abolition and transfer of state territorial claims, made rules for admission of new states, established public education, recognized and codified 'natural rights', prohibited slavery, and defined the land rights and applicability of laws to the Indians.\n\n===Law and government===\n[[File:United States 1789-08-1790-04.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Map of the states and territories of the United States as it was on August 7, 1789, when the Northwest Territory was first organized, to April 2, 1790, when the future [[Southwest Territory]] was ceded by North Carolina]]\nAt first, the [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] had a modified form of [[martial law]]. The governor was also the senior army [[Commissioned officer|officer]] within the territory, and he combined [[legislative]] and [[executive branch|executive authority]]. But a [[supreme court]] was established, and he shared legislative powers with the [[court]]. County governments were organized as soon as the population was sufficient, and these assumed local [[Public administration|administrative]] and [[judicial]] functions. [[Washington County, Ohio|Washington County]] was the first of these, at [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] in 1788. This was an important event, as this court was the first establishment of civil and criminal law in the pioneer country.\n\nAs soon as the number of free male [[settler]]s exceeded 5,000, the territorial legislature was to be created, and this happened in 1798. The full mechanisms of government were put in place, as outlined in the [[Northwest Ordinance]]. A [[bicameral legislature]] consisted of a [[State legislature (United States)|House of Representatives]] and a Council. The first House had 22 [[Legislator|representatives]], apportioned by population of each county.<ref name=ohio1917>{{cite book |title= Manual of Legislative Practice in the General Assembly |author= Ohio General Assembly |page= 199 |year= 1917 |publisher= State of Ohio |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7qesAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA199|author-link= Ohio General Assembly }}</ref> The House then nominated 10 citizens to be Council members. The nominations were sent to the U.S. Congress, which appointed five of them as the Council.

Early settlements were outside or nearby forts: Clarksville, Vincennes, Kaskaskia (French), Losantiville, and the Ohio Company settlements at Marietta and Waterford/Beverly. Later, after the Treaty of Greenville, settlements no longer needed to be spearheaded by forts, and sprang up everywhere simultaneously below the Treaty Line. There were dozens of unnamed settlements in addition to these.

Pakistani names vary depending upon [[Demographics of Pakistan|ethnicity]] and spoken [[Languages of Pakistan|language]].\n\n== Given names ==\nSince the [[Islam in Pakistan#Arrival of Islam in modern Pakistan|Muslim conquest of the Indus Valley]], the majority of Pakistani given names are derived from [[Persian name|Persian]], [[Arabic name|Arabic]] and [[Turkish name|Turkish]] names. Children may be given one, two or rarely three names at birth. If the person has more than one given name, one of them is chosen as the person's ''most called name'', by which he is called or referred to informally. Generally for males, [[Muhammad]], the name of the last prophet of Islam, is chosen to be the person's first given name, if he has more than one. Because of the prevalence of this practice, this name is usually not the person's most called name, as it does not serve as a unique identifier. [[Ali]] is the 2nd most common given name for males in Pakistan. Female names tend to be more mixed and are usually given two names. \n\n===Common male given names===\n{{main|:Category:Pakistani masculine given names}}\n* {{hlist| [[Abbas (name)|Abbas]] | [[Abdul]]

Surname ==\n{{see also|List of Pakistani family names}}\nUnlike the practice in Western countries, and other countries with predominant European influence, there is no one way of writing a full name in Pakistan. The most popular convention is to append the most called given name of the father to the person's given names. Often, if the person has more than one given name, his full name consists only of his given names. Another convention is to prefix the person's given name with a title, which is usually associated with his tribal ancestry. Due to western influence, appending rather than prefixing titles to given names has become more common. One notable exception is the title ''[[Khan (title)|Khan]]'', common in people of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] origin, which has always been appended rather than prefixed to given names. There are several titles used in Pakistan and other Muslim countries. ''[[Syed]]'', ''[[Shaikh]]'', ''[[Khawaja]]'', ''[[Pasha]]'', ''[[Mirza]]'', ''[[Chachar]]'' etc. are common. Less commonly, the tribal name itself is appended to the person's given names. For females, tribal names or titles rarely figure in the person's full name (although this has become more common due to Western influence). Instead her full name would be composed of her given names only, or if given only one name, her given name appended with her father's most called name. After marriage, the full name would be her most called name appended with her husband's most called name. In official documents, a person's identity is established by listing both the person's full name (however they may write it), and their father's. For married women, the husband's name might be used instead of the father's. Official forms always contain fields for both names, and they are used together as '''''A''' son/daughter/wife of '''B''''' on ID cards, passports, diplomas, in court, etc. The problem with these naming conventions is that it is difficult to trace back family roots. Many Muslims have settled in Western world and this naming convention creates some problems as a father will have  a different ''surname'' or ''family name'' from his children.\n\n===Rahis===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Abro]]\n*[[Akhoond]]\n*[[Arbab]]\n*[[Baba (honorific)|Baba]]\n*[[Babu (title)|Babu]]\n* [[Baig]]\n*[[Begum]]\n*[[Chaudhary]]\n*[[Dewan]]\n*[[Effendi]]\n*[[Emir]]\n*[[Faujdar]]\n*[[Ghalotar (Jutt)]]\n*[[ Ghengat ]] \n*[[Gardezi]]\n*[[Jam (title of nobility)|Jam]]\n*[[Jarral]]\n*[[Khan (title)|Khan]]\n*[[Khan Bahadur (title)|Khan Bahadur]]\n*[[Khan Sahib]]\n*[[Khatun]]\n*[[Khattak]]\n*[[Mahr]]\n*[[Sharif]]\n*[[Makhdoom]]\n*[[Malik]]\n*[[Maqsood]]\n*[[Mir (title)|Mir]]\n*[[Mirza]]\n*[[Mullah]]\n*[[Niazi]]\n*[[Nawab]]\n*[[Padishah]]\n*[[Qureshi]]\n*[[Qanungoh Shaikh]] \n*[[Rais]]\n*[[Raja]]\n*[[Rana (title)|Rana]]\n*[[Rawal]]\n*[[Saeen]]\n*[[Sahib]]\n*[[Saravan (title)|Saravan]]\n*[[Sardar]]\n*[[Shah]]\n*[[Shaikh]]                                               \n*[[Soomro]]\n*[[Subahdar]]\n*[[Sultan]]\n*[[Sultana (title)|Sultana]]\n*[[Syed]]\n*[[Tumandar]]\n*[[Ustad]]\n*[[Vizier]]\n*[[rahoo]]\n*[[Vali (governor)|Vali]]\n}}\u2022 Chaudhry or Choudhury\n\n===Prefixes===\n* [[Hajji|Haji]], one who had made the [[Hajj|Muslim pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]].\n* [[Emir|Mir]], generally indicates [[sayid|seyed]] and/or royal descent.\n* [[Saeen]], used for people who speak Sindhi\n*[[Syed]], used for people belonging to the family of Muhummad\n\n===Suffixes===\n*'''-i''', a common suffix used for surnames.\n*'''-zai''', \"descendant of\" used commonly in Pashtun surnames.\n*'''-nia''', \"His/Her highness (Title)\".\n*'''-bakhsh''', \"granted by\".\n*'''-dad''' ''(Middle Persian: D\u0101ta)'', \"given by\".\n\n==Names by ethnicity==\n===Baloch names===\n{{main|:Category:Baloch names}}\n\n===Gilgiti names===\n{{Main|:Category:Gilgiti names}}\n\n===Kashmiri names===\n{{main|:Category:Kashmiri names}}\n\n===Pashtun names===\n{{main|Pashtun names}}\n\n===Punjabi names===\n{{main|:Category:Punjabi names}}\n\n===Saraiki names===\n\n{{main|:Category:Saraiki names}}\n\n===Sindhi names===\n{{main|Sindhi names}}\n\n===Urdu names===\n{{main|:Category:Urdu names}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Pakistani family names]]\n* [[:Category:Titles in Pakistan|Honorifics in Pakistan]]\n* [[Arabic name]]\n* [[Turkish name]]\n* [[Persian name]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Names in world cultures}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pakistani Name}}\n[[Category:Pakistani names|*]]\n[[Category:Names by culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=November 2018}}\n{{Culture of Pakistan}}\n\nA '''Pakistani name''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|'''\u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0646\u0627\u0645'''}}}}) consists of a [[given name]], sometimes a [[middle name]], and a [[surname]]. Pakistani names vary depending upon [[Demographics of Pakistan|ethnicity]] and spoken [[Languages of Pakistan|language]].\n\n== Given names ==\nSince the [[Islam in Pakistan#Arrival of Islam in modern Pakistan|Muslim conquest of the Indus Valley]], the majority of Pakistani given names are derived from [[Persian name|Persian]], [[Arabic name|Arabic]] and [[Turkish name|Turkish]] names. Children may be given one, two or rarely three names at birth. If the person has more than one given name, one of them is chosen as the person's ''most called name'', by which he is called or referred to informally. Generally for males, [[Muhammad]], the name of the last prophet of Islam, is chosen to be the person's first given name, if he has more than one. Because of the prevalence of this practice, this name is usually not the person's most called name, as it does not serve as a unique identifier. [[Ali]] is the 2nd most common given name for males in Pakistan. Female names tend to be more mixed and are usually given two names. \n\n===Common male given names===\n{{main|:Category:Pakistani masculine given names}}\n* {{hlist| [[Abbas (name)|Abbas]] | [[Abdul]]

Surname ==\n{{see also|List of Pakistani family names}}\nUnlike the practice in Western countries, and other countries with predominant European influence, there is no one way of writing a full name in Pakistan. The most popular convention is to append the most called given name of the father to the person's given names. Often, if the person has more than one given name, his full name consists only of his given names. Another convention is to prefix the person's given name with a title, which is usually associated with his tribal ancestry. Due to western influence, appending rather than prefixing titles to given names has become more common. One notable exception is the title ''[[Khan (title)|Khan]]'', common in people of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] origin, which has always been appended rather than prefixed to given names. There are several titles used in Pakistan and other Muslim countries. ''[[Syed]]'', ''[[Shaikh]]'', ''[[Khawaja]]'', ''[[Pasha]]'', ''[[Mirza]]'', ''[[Chachar]]'' etc. are common. Less commonly, the tribal name itself is appended to the person's given names. For females, tribal names or titles rarely figure in the person's full name (although this has become more common due to Western influence). Instead her full name would be composed of her given names only, or if given only one name, her given name appended with her father's most called name. After marriage, the full name would be her most called name appended with her husband's most called name. In official documents, a person's identity is established by listing both the person's full name (however they may write it), and their father's. For married women, the husband's name might be used instead of the father's. Official forms always contain fields for both names, and they are used together as '''''A''' son/daughter/wife of '''B''''' on ID cards, passports, diplomas, in court, etc. The problem with these naming conventions is that it is difficult to trace back family roots.

New distributions are updated continually, and the next candidate is released after a time-based [[Freeze (software engineering)|freeze]].\n\nSince its founding, Debian has been developed openly and distributed freely according to the principles of the [[GNU Project]]. Because of this, the [[Free Software Foundation]] sponsored the project from November 1994 to November 1995.

The last version of Debian kFreeBSD was Debian 8 (Jessie) RC3.\n\nDebian GNU/kFreeBSD was created in 2002.<ref>{{Cite mailing list|url=https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2002/01/msg00000.html|title=Chrooted NetBSD environment available for testing|date=2002-01-06|mailing-list=debian-bsd|first=Matthew|last=Garrett}}</ref> It was included in Debian 6.0 (Squeeze) as a [[technology preview]], and in Debian 7.0 (Wheezy) as an official port.

The last version of Debian kFreeBSD was Debian 8 (Jessie) RC3.\n\nDebian GNU/kFreeBSD was created in 2002.<ref>{{Cite mailing list|url=https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2002/01/msg00000.html|title=Chrooted NetBSD environment available for testing|date=2002-01-06|mailing-list=debian-bsd|first=Matthew|last=Garrett}}</ref> It was included in Debian 6.0 (Squeeze) as a [[technology preview]], and in Debian 7.0 (Wheezy) as an official port.

One day, Sabzian is riding a bus with a copy of a published screenplay of ''[[The Cyclist]]''; Mrs. Ahankhah sits next to him, revealing she is a fan of the film. Sabzian tells her that he himself is Makhmalbaf, the creator and learns that her sons are interested in film. Posing as Makhmalbaf, Sabzian visits the Ahankhah family several times over the next two weeks. He flatters them by saying he wants to use their house in his next film and their sons as actors. He also borrows 1,900&nbsp;[[Iranian toman|toman]]s from one of the sons for cab fare. Mr. Ahankhah starts to suspect him as an imposter trying to rob them, especially when a magazine photograph shows a younger Makhmalbaf with darker hair. He invites a journalist, Hossain Farazmand, who confirms that Sabzian is indeed an impostor. The police come to arrest Sabzian, while Farazmand takes several pictures for his upcoming article titled \"Bogus Makhmalbaf Arrested\".<ref>These scenes are shown in flashback throughout the film and were re-enacted.</ref>\n\nKiarostami visits Sabzian in prison and helps to move his trial up, and receives permission from the judge to record the trial. At the trial, Sabzian is tried for fraud and attempted fraud. He reveals his motivations for the imitation as love for Makhmalbaf's film and cinema, while the Ahankhah's son recounts his visits as they started to suspect him. Due to his circumstances as a young father with no prior record and his remorse, the judge asks the family if they would be willing to pardon Sabzian. They agree in exchange for him becoming a productive member of society. After the trial, the real Makhmalbaf meets Sabzian and gives him a ride back to the Ahankhah's house, with Kiarostami's crew following. When they meet Mr. Ahankhah, he says of Sabzian: \"I hope he'll be good now and make us proud of him.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* Hossain Sabzian as Himself\n* [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]] as Himself\n* [[Abbas Kiarostami]] as Himself\n* Abolfazl Ahankhah as Himself\n* Mehrdad Ahankhah as Himself\n* Monoochehr Ahankhah as Himself\n* Mahrokh Ahankhah as Herself\n* Haj Ali Reza Ahmadi as Himself, the Judge\n* Nayer Mohseni Zonoozi as Herself\n* Ahmad Reza Moayed Mohseni as Himself, a family friend\n* Hossain Farazmand as Himself, a reporter\n* Hooshang Shamaei as Himself, a Taxi Driver\n* Mohammad Ali Barrati as Himself, a Soldier\n* Davood Goodarzi as Himself, a Sergeant\n* Hassan Komaili as Himself, a Court Recorder\n* Davood Mohabbat as Himself, a Court Recorder\n<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/442910/Close-Up/full-credits.html TCM.com]</ref>\n\n==Notes==\nThe film references one of Kiarostami's previous films, the 1974 soccer drama ''[[The Traveler (1974 film)|The Traveler]]'' (considered  by the director to be his first 'authentic' feature). <ref>[https://www.criterionchannel.com/close-up/videos/the-traveler The Traveler - Close-up - Criterion Channel]</ref>\n\nIt also mentions ''[[The Cyclist]]''<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092651/ The Cyclist (1989)- IMDb]</ref>, a 1987 sports drama film made by the real Mohsen Makhmalbaf three years prior to ''[[Close-Up]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0538532/ - IMDb]</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Close-Up'' is based on real events that occurred in Northern Tehran in the late 1980s. Kiarostami first heard about Sabzian in 1989 after reading about the incident in an article in the Iranian magazine ''Sorush'' by journalist Hassan Farazmand. Kiarostami immediately suspended work on the film project that he was in pre-production of and began making a documentary on Sabzian. Kiarostami was allowed to film Sabzian's trial and also got Sabzian, the Ahankhahs and Farazmand to agree to participate in the film and to re-enact incidents from the past. Kiarostami also arranged for Mohsen Makhmalbaf to meet Sabzian and help facilitate forgiveness between Sabzian and the Ahankhahs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1492-close-up-prison-and-escape| title = Close-up: Prison and Escape|accessdate =November 18, 2012 |publisher= www.criterion.com |date = June 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nWhen the film opened in Iran, reviews were almost uniformly negative, and the film only began to be appreciated after it was shown abroad.{{citation needed}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Stephen Holden]] called the film \"brilliant,\" noting its \"radically drab cinema-verite style that helps blur any difference between what is real and what is reconstructed.\"<ref>Holden, Stephen, \"Close Up (1990)\nFILM REVIEW; The Pathos Of Deceit By a Victim Of Longing.\" ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 31, 1999, Accessed on November 17, 2012.</ref> \n\nIn 2010 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic Dennis Lim called the film eloquent and direct and that it provided \"a window into the psyche of a complicated man and into the social and cultural reality of Iran.\"<ref>Lim, Dennis, \"A Second Look: Abbas Kiarostami's 'Close-Up'.\" ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', June 9, 2010, Accessed on November 17, 2012.</ref> In 2012 it ranked #43 in the [[British Film Institute]]'s critics' poll of [[BFI The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|the 50 best films ever made]].\n\n==Influence==\nFive years after ''Close-Up'', Moslem Mansouri and Mahmoud Chokrollahi wrote and directed the documentary ''Close-Up Long Shot'' ({{lang-fa|\u06a9\u0644\u0648\u0632\u0622\u067e \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0631 }}, '' Kl\u016bz\u0101p nem\u0101-ye d\u016br'') in which Sabzian talks about his infatuation with cinema, his impersonation of Makhmalbaf and how his life has changed after working with Kiarostami.

They agree in exchange for him becoming a productive member of society. After the trial, the real Makhmalbaf meets Sabzian and gives him a ride back to the Ahankhah's house, with Kiarostami's crew following. When they meet Mr. Ahankhah, he says of Sabzian: \"I hope he'll be good now and make us proud of him.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* Hossain Sabzian as Himself\n* [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]] as Himself\n* [[Abbas Kiarostami]] as Himself\n* Abolfazl Ahankhah as Himself\n* Mehrdad Ahankhah as Himself\n* Monoochehr Ahankhah as Himself\n* Mahrokh Ahankhah as Herself\n* Haj Ali Reza Ahmadi as Himself, the Judge\n* Nayer Mohseni Zonoozi as Herself\n* Ahmad Reza Moayed Mohseni as Himself, a family friend\n* Hossain Farazmand as Himself, a reporter\n* Hooshang Shamaei as Himself, a Taxi Driver\n* Mohammad Ali Barrati as Himself, a Soldier\n* Davood Goodarzi as Himself, a Sergeant\n* Hassan Komaili as Himself, a Court Recorder\n* Davood Mohabbat as Himself, a Court Recorder\n<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/442910/Close-Up/full-credits.html TCM.com]</ref>\n\n==Notes==\nThe film references one of Kiarostami's previous films, the 1974 soccer drama ''[[The Traveler (1974 film)|The Traveler]]'' (considered  by the director to be his first 'authentic' feature). <ref>[https://www.criterionchannel.com/close-up/videos/the-traveler The Traveler - Close-up - Criterion Channel]</ref>\n\nIt also mentions ''[[The Cyclist]]''<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092651/ The Cyclist (1989)- IMDb]</ref>, a 1987 sports drama film made by the real Mohsen Makhmalbaf three years prior to ''[[Close-Up]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0538532/ - IMDb]</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Close-Up'' is based on real events that occurred in Northern Tehran in the late 1980s.

Kiarostami immediately suspended work on the film project that he was in pre-production of and began making a documentary on Sabzian. Kiarostami was allowed to film Sabzian's trial and also got Sabzian, the Ahankhahs and Farazmand to agree to participate in the film and to re-enact incidents from the past. Kiarostami also arranged for Mohsen Makhmalbaf to meet Sabzian and help facilitate forgiveness between Sabzian and the Ahankhahs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1492-close-up-prison-and-escape| title = Close-up: Prison and Escape|accessdate =November 18, 2012 |publisher= www.criterion.com |date = June 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nWhen the film opened in Iran, reviews were almost uniformly negative, and the film only began to be appreciated after it was shown abroad.

His position at court was not very high, but he had an extensive staff, the \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03cc\u03bf\u03b9 (''paroinochoi'', \"assistant wine-pourers\").{{sfn|Guilland|1967|p=242}} The post was imitated in the staff of the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] and in the households of great magnates.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Pinkernes\" (A.

Several senior generals of the [[Palaiologan period]], such as [[Michael Tarchaneiotes Glabas]], [[Alexios Philanthropenos]] and [[Syrgiannes Palaiologos]], were awarded the title.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Pinkernes\" (A.

In [[Scandinavia]], ''[[leverpostej]]'' (in the Netherlands: ''[[leverpastei]]'') is a popular baked ''p\u00e2t\u00e9'' similar to the French ''p\u00e2t\u00e9 en terrine'', usually made of [[lard]] and pork liver.\n\nIn Poland, ''pasztet'' is made from poultry, fish, venison, ham, or pork with eggs, flour, bread crumbs, and a varied range of additions, such as pepper, tomato sauce, mushrooms, spices, vegetables, ginger, nutmeg, cheese, or [[sugar]].\n\nIn Russia and Ukraine, the dish is mostly prepared with beef, goose or chicken liver<ref>[http://www.enjoyyourcooking.com/appetizers-and-snacks/chicken-liver-pate.html enjoyyourcooking.com]</ref> and thus is commonly known as ''pechyonochniy pashtet'' ({{lang-ru|\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0451\u043d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0435\u0442}}, \"liver p\u00e2t\u00e9\"), however other meats also can be used. Unlike the Western European method the liver is first cooked (boiled or fried) and mixed with butter or fat and seasoning such as fresh or fried onion, carrots, spices and herbs. It can be further cooked (usually baked), but most often is used without any other preparation. In Russia, the p\u00e2t\u00e9 is served on a plate or in a bowl, and is often molded into the shapes of animals, such as hedgehogs.<ref>{{cite book   | title = A Taste of Russia: A Cookbook of Russian Hospitality | author=  Darra Goldstein |publisher = Russian Information Service | location=   |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aKEICug2T-EC&pg=PA33&dq=russian+pate&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwidpuCm1-vWAhVryFQKHTKpCxwQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=russian%20pate&f=false | date = 1999  | page =  33| isbn = 9781880100424  | accessdate = 12 October 2017 }}</ref> A similar recipe is known as [[chopped liver]] in [[Jewish cuisine|Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine]], where [[schmaltz]] is used instead of butter and hard-boiled eggs are usually added.

The city is located between National Highways NH-53 and NH-30, about 17&nbsp;km  south-east of  the capital city [[Raipur]]. [[Swami Vivekananda Airport]] separates Raipur and Nava Raipur.\n\nAbout half of the total acquired land is being used for public facilities; 23%  of the land would be reserved for government and educational institutions; and 30% of the land will be used for residential and economical purposes. The city is envisaged to accommodate about 560,000 people by phase III, i.e., within 2031 as per the Master Development Plan prepared by Naya [[Raipur]] Development Authority now Nava Raipur Development Authority. Provisions have been made for its expansion and to upgrade infrastructure in the future.\n\nNaya Raipur is India's seventh [[Planned community|planned city]] after [[Jamshedpur]] (Jharkhand), [[Bhubaneshwar]] (Odisha), [[Gandhinagar]] (Gujarat), [[Chandigarh]] (Punjab and Haryana), [[Navi Mumbai]] (Maharashtra), and [[Durgapur]] (West Bengal) and fourth among the capital cities.\n\n== Planning ==\n\nA comprehensive exercise was undertaken to find a perfect location for the city. An imaginary circle of 50&nbsp;km radius was drawn around [[Raipur]] and this massive area was divided into four quadrants.\n\nEach quadrant was analysed in context of regional development, existing development, climatic factors, flora and fauna, water resources, transport network etc. and the efforts yielded the present site southeast of Raipur at about 15&nbsp;km distance, close to Mana Airport.

Hence a special area has been notified under section 64 of Nagar Tatha Gramnivesh Adhiniyam 1973.\n\nThe authority thus formed is the [[Capital Area Development Authority]] (CADA) which is now called the [[Naya Raipur Development Authority]] (NRDA).

The resultant space quantum was then allocated on two-dimension on the structure plan and final quantum, shape, location, was defined by exact boundaries/roads on the plan.\n\nWith iterations, the allocated spaces were again translated in terms of number of jobs and the total number of job in the city arrived at. With a population of 5.6 lakhs, the Naya Raipur City is expected to generate approximately 2.2 lakh jobs, with an assumed workforce participation rate of 40%. The high standards of physical and social infrastructure adopted for the city will be able to cope with the maximum capacity of the city.<ref name=\"nayaraipur.in\">[http://www.nayaraipur.in/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=48&Itemid=53]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Roads ===\n* Length of proposed roads: 225&nbsp;km\n* Construction work on 71&nbsp;km of road has been started (100&nbsp;m and 60&nbsp;m row)\n* Construction agency: M/s B.

The city is located between National Highways NH-53 and NH-30, about 17&nbsp;km  south-east of  the capital city [[Raipur]]. [[Swami Vivekananda Airport]] separates Raipur and Nava Raipur.\n\nAbout half of the total acquired land is being used for public facilities; 23%  of the land would be reserved for government and educational institutions; and 30% of the land will be used for residential and economical purposes. The city is envisaged to accommodate about 560,000 people by phase III, i.e., within 2031 as per the Master Development Plan prepared by Naya [[Raipur]] Development Authority now Nava Raipur Development Authority. Provisions have been made for its expansion and to upgrade infrastructure in the future.\n\nNaya Raipur is India's seventh [[Planned community|planned city]] after [[Jamshedpur]] (Jharkhand), [[Bhubaneshwar]] (Odisha), [[Gandhinagar]] (Gujarat), [[Chandigarh]] (Punjab and Haryana), [[Navi Mumbai]] (Maharashtra), and [[Durgapur]] (West Bengal) and fourth among the capital cities.\n\n== Planning ==\n\nA comprehensive exercise was undertaken to find a perfect location for the city. An imaginary circle of 50&nbsp;km radius was drawn around [[Raipur]] and this massive area was divided into four quadrants.\n\nEach quadrant was analysed in context of regional development, existing development, climatic factors, flora and fauna, water resources, transport network etc. and the efforts yielded the present site southeast of Raipur at about 15&nbsp;km distance, close to Mana Airport.

Hence a special area has been notified under section 64 of Nagar Tatha Gramnivesh Adhiniyam 1973.\n\nThe authority thus formed is the [[Capital Area Development Authority]] (CADA) which is now called the [[Naya Raipur Development Authority]] (NRDA).

The resultant space quantum was then allocated on two-dimension on the structure plan and final quantum, shape, location, was defined by exact boundaries/roads on the plan.\n\nWith iterations, the allocated spaces were again translated in terms of number of jobs and the total number of job in the city arrived at. With a population of 5.6 lakhs, the Naya Raipur City is expected to generate approximately 2.2 lakh jobs, with an assumed workforce participation rate of 40%. The high standards of physical and social infrastructure adopted for the city will be able to cope with the maximum capacity of the city.<ref name=\"nayaraipur.in\">[http://www.nayaraipur.in/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=48&Itemid=53]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Roads ===\n* Length of proposed roads: 225&nbsp;km\n* Construction work on 71&nbsp;km of road has been started (100&nbsp;m and 60&nbsp;m row)\n* Construction agency: M/s B.

Unfortunately, no milling process at the time could adequately separate the complex mixture of copper, lead and zinc sulphides. AND Company did try to mine this site seasonally from 1906 until 1911.\n\nIn 1916, the [[Asarco|American Smelting and Refining Company (Asarco)]] learned of the Buchans River ore deposit and obtained samples for metallurgical testing. It wasn't until 1925 that a suitable method for separating the various metals in Buchans ore was finally perfected by Asarco.\n\nAsarco leased the mining rights to the Buchans River Mine; In return, the AND Company would receive 50 per cent of the profits from the mine's development. In the spring of 1926, Asarco began prospecting for additional orebodies on the lease land, led by Asarco engineer J.Ward Williams and Swedish Geophysicist Hans Lundberg. This prospecting led to the discoveries that would ensure a long and prosperous mining operation at Buchans and the construction of a permanent company town.\n\n===Buchans Mines===\n[[File:Buchans Mines, Newfoundland.png|thumbnail|Buchans Mines]]\n'''Old Buchans'''\n\nThe original 1905 Buchans discovery made by Matty Mitchell was only the first in a series of discoveries that would lead to 57 years of continuous mining later during the life of the down. \"Old Buchans\" as that mine was called, only produced a small percentage of the ore at Buchans - 217,135 tons. It was mined from 1943 to 1956 [Asarco accessed this orebody not through the original 1906-1911 shaft but connected to the mine primarily via 1 level in Oriental] and again in 1977 and 1978 [1977-78 - open pit/surface]. Besides Old Buchans, four major mines operated at different times between 1927 and 1984 - Lucky Strike Mine, Oriental, Rothermere, and MacLeans.\n\n'''Lucky Strike'''\n\nLucky Strike orebody, named because it was discovered after a chance change of plans in exploration, was discovered on July 14, 1926. This mine, with its iconic 100&nbsp;ft headframe overlooking the town; would produce ore from 1928 to 1958 and again from 1972 to 1979. In that time, 6,253,660 tons of ore were produced at Lucky Strike. As with all underground mines at Buchans, its nowmal underground \"levels\" were approximately 200&nbsp;ft apart from one another and included elaborate workings for an office, explosives magazine, lunch room, and other functional areas. Lucky strike mine shaft extends 714&nbsp;ft underground.\n\n'''Oriental'''\n\nOriental orebody, named due to its location east of Buchans River, was discovered on August 7, 1926. It would go on to produce ore as an underground mine from 1935 to 1969 and again briefly from surface/pit sources from 1980 to 1981 and from 1983 to 1984. 3,372,224 Tons of ore were produced over the life of Oriental mine.\n\n'''Rothermere'''\n\nRothermere was discovered near the end of 1947. It was named after Lord Rothermere, whose family founded the AND company. The Rothermere mine shaft was 2,505 feet deep. The mine operated from 1950 to 1978. It produced a total of 3,508,226 tons of ore.\n\n'''MacLean's'''\n\nThe deepest orebody mined at Buchans was MacLeans. It was named after Dr. Hugh J. MacLean, Asarco's chief geologist in Buchans from 1941 until his tragic death in a bush plane crash at South Pond in 1951. MacLeans was discovered in 1950. MacLeans mine shaft was completed at a depth of 3,526 feet below surface [though the mine is actually deeper than this due to the mining of MacLean's extension in 1983 and 1984 through a \"winze\" (diagonal decline) tunnel leading to \"21 level.\"] The mine produced ore from 1959 to 1981 and from 1983 to 1984. MacLeans produced a total of 3,514,989 tons of ore.\n\n'''Labour disputes'''\n\nThere were four official strikes in the history of Buchans mining operation. The first was in 1941 and lasted 15 days. The second, involving just miners, happened in 1955 and lasted 36 days. The third strike lasted from June 12 to November 12, 1971. The fourth, final and longest strike lasted from March 15 to October 2, 1973.\n\n'''Mine fatalities'''\n\nBetween 1927 and 1984, the years of Asarco mining at Buchans, a total of twenty-three men lost their lives in accidents. The majority of these deaths occurred in the earlier years of the operations.\n\n== Transportation links ==\n[[File:Buchans Lake.png|thumbnail|Buchans Lake]]\n'''Initial years'''\n\nAND co purchased the [[Millertown Railway]]<ref>[http://gfwheritagesociety.ca/media-library/photo-library/woods-department-millertown-harpoon-railway-september-1956/ Millertown Railway photo]</ref><ref>[http://www.trainweb.org/oldtimetrains/nfld/millertown.htm Millertown Railway]</ref> in 1910, which had been constructed in 1900 and linked to the [[Newfoundland Railway]] at [[Millertown Junction, Newfoundland and Labrador|Millertown Junction]]. Almost all travel to the Buchans River site prior to the fall of 1927 was by rail to Millertown on the Millertown railway then by boat to Buchans Landing on the north shore of Red Indian Lake, then by foot or mechanized vehicle over a rough corduroy road to Buchans. Prospectors and other early visitors probably walked/portaged along Buchans River from its mouth.\n\n'''Railway and highway'''\n\nIn the fall of 1927, the Buchans Railway connected the town to the outside world. This railway joined the Milltertown Railway at Four Mile Siding, near Mary March Brook, which would become the community of Buchans Junction. All concentrate was shipped by train to the port of [[Botwood]] until the railway closed in 1977. A route for a highway to Buchans was surveyed in 1948. The highway itself was completed and opened in 1956. In the final years of the [[Asarco]] operation (1977\u20131984), Buchans concentrate was trucked to Botwood by Cook's Transport Ltd. From the port of Botwood the ore would be sent to smelters all over the world. The Buchans railway bed remains a popular [[Rail trail|trail]] for ATVs and snowmobiles.\n\n'''Air'''\n\nAn Airstrip was constructed east of Buchans Lake in 1942. It was constructed initially by the Canadian Department of Transport with the permission of the government of the Dominion of Newfoundland for use by the Canadian Department of National Defence. Its two gravel runways were maintained by a small resident staff until 1965. At that time, most of the buildings and equipment at the site were removed; the three houses for airstrip staff were relocated to Buchans. Eastern Provincial Airways also briefly included Buchans as a stop/destination on one of its routes\u2014this occurred in the summer of 1956. While the northwest runway was rarely used even between 1942 and 1965 (drainage issues with the site), and fell into complete disrepair at the end of that period, the southwest-northeast runway has been repaired from time to time for use in more recent decades.\n\nAsarco also made use of Buchans Lake as a base for various float-planes over the years. These planes were used for transportation and to supply mineral exploration camps in the region. In later years, road access and helicopters were preferred for such work. A Hangar was constructed near the Buchans dam. Among the bush planes based there between the 1950s and 1970s were the de Havilland Otter and later the de Havilland Beaver. The Hangar was demolished in the early 1990s.\n\n'''Major secondary access roads'''\n\nIn the 1960s, a road was extended from the Buchans Highway (at a point near Buchans River) to provide access to resources located near the north shores of Red Indian Lake. Known locally as the \"New Road\", this road initially extended as far as Star River. Its extension, improvement and the addition of new bridges led to its connection to the Burgeo Highway (Route 480). Several studies have explored and recommended the upgrade of this route to have a provincial class highway connecting routes 480 and 370. These studies include reports of the Government of Newfoundland's Buchans Task Force in 1976 and the Buchans Action Committee in the early 1980s. The \"New Road\" as it stands has provided access for pulpwood cutting, tourism, fishing, hunting, aquaculture, silviculture, mineral exploration, as well as access to the Star Lake Hydroelectric Development. When passable, it still provides access for local residents and visitors to the Lloyd's Valley and Southwest Brook areas.\n\nThe Construction of the Hinds Lake hydroelectric project in 1980 led to the extension of a gravel road north from the Buchans Airstrip to Hinds Dike at the southernmost end of Hinds Lake. Forest access roads extending from near the community of Howley are now only a few miles from this road. This general route has been considered for a possible upgrade to allow for a provincial class highway connection between routes 401 and 370. While the Buchans to Hinds Lake road is less passable, these access roads are used by hunters, outfitters, snowmobilers, ATV users and other outdoors enthusiasts.\n\n== Early Town History ==\n'''Company Town'''\n\nMost of the employees working on the development of the mine, construction of the town, and construction of the railway were housed in temporary camps. The first worker's home in Buchans was completed on March 13, 1927; twenty-six homes were completed by the end of that year. By the time of first concentrate production in September 1928, there were 56 housing units, an apartment house, a staff house, hospital, a town hall, and several bunkhouses in the town. Several businesses including a retail store, a laundromat and a barber shop had also been established. Both the company and the Roman Catholic Church opened schools in the town. In 1929, the company constructed tennis courts, a ski run, an athletic field, and, in winter months, converted one of its concentrate sheds into a skating rink. Buchans had running water, sewage, electricity, and other services in place by 1928. The town would grow in size and prosper throughout the next few decades. From 1927 until the late 1970s, most town services and infrastructure were administered directly by the company. Company support, subsidization and direction also continued during that time for most of the town's major recreational services.\n\n'''Municipal History'''\n\nAfter the Buchans highway was opened in 1956, several families who wished to own their own houses independent of the company-administered town settled on the banks of the Buchans River at the point where the highway crossed it, in a settlement known as \"Pigeon Inlet.\" This settlement was named after the fictional community of \"Pigeon Inlet\" created by Newfoundland writer Ted Russell. In 1963 these houses were re-located to a subdivision on the southeast corner of town. The subdivision, which became known as \"Townsite\" became the Local Improvement District of Buchans. Residents of \"Townsite\" owned their own homes and managed municipal affairs independently of Asarco. On October 1, 1978, the company town became a separate local improvement district. The two municipal governments merged to form the first democratically elected municipal government for the entire town on June 18, 1979.\n\n'''Hockey'''\n\nHockey, including school hockey and town and plant internal leagues had been a major recreational activity in Buchans going back to the 1930s. Games were played on nearby ponds, and eventually of the two large Asarco ore sheds on the north side of the town was converted each season into a skating/hockey rink.\n\nBuchans was among the towns on the island to compete for the [[Herder Memorial Trophy]], fielding senior teams from the 1930s through to 1969. The Buchans Miners senior hockey team won the Herder in 1950, 1951, 1952, 1954, and 1963. A Buchans team of one name or another also was runner-up for the trophy in 1937, 1940, 1948, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1964, 1968 and 1969. In addition to exceptional local talent, the Buchans Miners hockey dynasty attracted marquis \"import\" players from various parts of Newfoundland as well as from as far away as Kirkland Lake Ontario and parts of industrial Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.\n\nBuchans Minor Hockey Association sported impressive local Pee-Wee and Bantam leagues. From the 1960s through the early 1980s, Buchans Atom, Pee-Wee, Bantam and Midget teams frequently won championships in NAHA's B divisions. There was also a brief resurgence of championship wins in E-H divisions for Pee-Wee, Bantam and Midget teams from Buchans in the 1990s.\n\n== Final years of Asarco operation ==\nOn 17 March 1976 Asarco Incorporated, Buchans Unit and Price (Nfld.) Pulp and Paper Limited (Incorporated in 1962 replacing AND co - would later become Abitibi-Price then Abitibi-Bowater) signed a new contract whereby Price repossessed its original mineral exploration rights over the entire 1905 A.N.D. Co. concession area except for the mine site. The two companies agreed to continue sharing the profits from the existing mines and from any future mines developed on deposits discovered by ASARCO prior to March 1976.\n\nIn 1980/1981, Asarco also mined a 2,000+ ton bulk sample by way of an adit developed at the Tulks Hill Lead-Zinc orebody near the southwestern corner of Red Indian Lake. (This prospect, with between 600,000 and 800,000 tons of recoverable ore, as of June 2017, had not yet been mined).\n\nIn 1977 Asarco began to divest itself of company owned houses and community infrastructure. Asarco shut all mining operations at its Buchans Unit in 1982 with only 12 workers remaining on the property, down from 550 in 1978. Mining resumed briefly in 1983 and 1984 at the MacLean extension and at Oriental Mine where some ore was mined from two pits near Oriental Mine shaft. All mining production ceased in September 1984. 17.5 million tons were mined and processed over the 55-year history of mining at Buchans.  ASARCO also closed its remaining barite recovery operation, which had operated seasonally in the early 1980s.\n\n== Buchans since 1984 ==\nIn the years since the closure of the Asarco operation, the population of the town, which had fluctuated but remained between 2,500 and 3,000 throughout the most prosperous years of the mine, began to drop in the late 1970s as ore reserves dwindled, production declined and layoffs occurred. By 1985, the population had decreased to 1,500. The 2011 Canadian Census reported the population of Buchans to be 696.\n\nConsiderable environmental remediation work and study continued after Asarco's initial work on tailings revegetation in the mid-1970s. This work was also complemented with a multitide of studies, water and soil monitoring activities, and mine site decommissioning/demolition projects throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Few of the mine site(s)' structures remain. Most of those that do remain are now used by other enterprises in the area. While Asarco maintained a consultancy presence until the early 2000s, most of the responsibility for ongoing remediation and monitoring belonged to Abitibi-Price (later called Abitibi Consolidated and later still Abitibi Bowater). Companies including but not limited to Amec and Boojum have studied the area and aided in the remediation efforts. Most of Abitibi Bowater's assets in Newfoundland were expropriated by the government of Newfoundland and Labrador in December 2008 and Abitibi Bowater later filed for Creditor Protection in 2009. With expropriation, responsibility for the land and assets in the Red Indian Lake watershed area, including Buchans, mostly came to rest with the provincial government's crown corporation -  Nalcor.\n\nIn recent months and years, in light of the financial difficulties of involved companies and some community interest, the provincial government has taken a renewed interest in one of the remaining stages of Buchans mine remediation - an older \"tailings spill\" area located to the southwest of the Town. Testing of one of the samples from this tailings area re-confirmed the (expected) presence of lead, one of the metals mined at Buchans. As a precautionary step, in 2009, provincial officials asked residents to be tested for lead levels in their blood. This testing yielded no results warranting further medical attention and no health risks were found. The 2010 Newfoundland and Labrador budget included $4 million to aid in the beautification, final cleanup and additional remediation of this site. This work was completed between 2010 and 2013.\n\nThere has been intermittent renewed private interest in the recycling of mine tailings to remove Barite for use in engineering services related to offshore drilling. A reorganized version of the Barite recycling operation first attempted by Asarco in the early 1980s, prepared and tested by another group in the late 2025s, did operate under Pennecon in 2009 and intermittently under another partnership in the mid 2010s. The tailings ponds near the Lucky Strike mine site contain millions of tons of material that is 30% barite.\n\nIn the years since the Asarco mine closure, many businesses continue to thrive in the town of Buchans. It remains a tourist destination - especially for people interested in fishing, hunting, hiking, other outdoor activities or learning about the town's rich mining heritage.\n\nMany Buchans expatriates return often and maintain a strong connection with their hometown. In 1986, the Town of Buchans held the first \"Come Home Year\" festival to encourage former residents to return and celebrate the town's rich history and heritage. Come Home Year festivals have more recently been held every five years, in the summers of 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012. The 2017 Come Home Year event marked 90 years since the formation of the town of Buchans. A shorter festival, known as the \"Lucky Strike Festival\" has been held annually in July during the years between Come Home Year festivals. Fundraising efforts at these events, as well as others such as the annual \"Save Our Plant\" (SOP) curling bonspiel help ensure that the residents of Buchans are able to continue to maintain and enjoy many of the exceptional recreational facilities and amenities established during the Asarco mining era.\n\n==Climate==\nAs typical of Newfoundland, Buchans has a [[humid continental climate]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=40827&cityname=Buchans%2C+Newfoundland%2C+Canada&units=|title=Buchans, Newfoundland, Canada Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref> with maritime influences.

island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].  It is situated on the northwest shore of [[Red Indian Lake]] on the [[Buchans River]].\n\nThe town is located within the statistical unit of [[Division No. 6, Newfoundland and Labrador|Census Division No. 6]], approximately 72 kilometres southwest of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] at the terminus of [[Newfoundland and Labrador Route 370|Route 370]].  According to [[Statistics Canada]], it had a population of 642 in 2016 (down from 696 in 2011), with 417 private dwellings.<ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n\nIts current mayor is Derm Corbett.\n\n==Discovery and mining history==\nIn 1905 the [[Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company]] (AND) was granted mineral rights to {{convert|2320|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} of central Newfoundland for 99 years; any commercial mining would result in payment of a 5% royalty to the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]].\n\n[[Mattie Mitchell]], a prospector and guide of [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] and Montagnais ancestry employed by AND is credited with the original discovery of zinc-lead-copper ore on the banks of the Buchans River. Most accounts state that he made his discovery early in the summer of 1905. Unfortunately, no milling process at the time could adequately separate the complex mixture of copper, lead and zinc sulphides. AND co did try to mine this site seasonally from 1906 until 1911.\n\nIn 1916, the [[Asarco|American Smelting and Refining Company (Asarco)]] learned of the Buchans River ore deposit and obtained samples for metallurgical testing. It wasn't until 1925 that a suitable method for separating the various metals in Buchans ore was finally perfected by Asarco.\n\nAsarco leased the mining rights to the Buchans River Mine; In return, the AND Company would receive 50 per cent of the profits from the mine's development. In the spring of 1926, Asarco began prospecting for additional orebodies on the lease land, led by Asarco engineer J.Ward Williams and Swedish Geophysicist Hans Lundberg. This prospecting led to the discoveries that would ensure a long and prosperous mining operation at Buchans and the construction of a permanent company town.\n\n===Buchans Mines===\n[[File:Buchans Mines, Newfoundland.png|thumbnail|Buchans Mines]]\n'''Old Buchans'''\n\nThe original 1905 Buchans discovery made by Matty Mitchell was only the first in a series of discoveries that would lead to 57 years of continuous mining later during the life of the down. \"Old Buchans\" as that mine was called, only produced a small percentage of the ore at Buchans - 217,135 tons. It was mined from 1943 to 1956 [Asarco accessed this orebody not through the original 1906-1911 shaft but connected to the mine primarily via 1 level in Oriental] and again in 1977 and 1978 [1977-78 - open pit/surface]. Besides Old Buchans, four major mines operated at different times between 1927 and 1984 - Lucky Strike Mine, Oriental, Rothermere, and MacLeans.\n\n'''Lucky Strike'''\n\nLucky Strike orebody, named because it was discovered after a chance change of plans in exploration, was discovered on July 14, 1926. This mine, with its iconic 100&nbsp;ft headframe overlooking the town; would produce ore from 1928 to 1958 and again from 1972 to 1979. In that time, 6,253,660 tons of ore were produced at Lucky Strike. As with all underground mines at Buchans, its nowmal underground \"levels\" were approximately 200&nbsp;ft apart from one another and included elaborate workings for an office, explosives magazine, lunch room, and other functional areas. Lucky strike mine shaft extends 714&nbsp;ft underground.\n\n'''Oriental'''\n\nOriental orebody, named due to its location east of Buchans River, was discovered on August 7, 1926. It would go on to produce ore as an underground mine from 1935 to 1969 and again briefly from surface/pit sources from 1980 to 1981 and from 1983 to 1984. 3,372,224 Tons of ore were produced over the life of Oriental mine.\n\n'''Rothermere'''\n\nRothermere was discovered near the end of 1947. It was named after Lord Rothermere, whose family founded the AND company. The Rothermere mine shaft was 2,505 feet deep. The mine operated from 1950 to 1978. It produced a total of 3,508,226 tons of ore.\n\n'''MacLean's'''\n\nThe deepest orebody mined at Buchans was MacLeans. It was named after Dr. Hugh J. MacLean, Asarco's chief geologist in Buchans from 1941 until his tragic death in a bush plane crash at South Pond in 1951. MacLeans was discovered in 1950. MacLeans mine shaft was completed at a depth of 3,526 feet below surface [though the mine is actually deeper than this due to the mining of MacLean's extension in 1983 and 1984 through a \"winze\" (diagonal decline) tunnel leading to \"21 level.\"] The mine produced ore from 1959 to 1981 and from 1983 to 1984. MacLeans produced a total of 3,514,989 tons of ore.\n\n'''Labour disputes'''\n\nThere were four official strikes in the history of Buchans mining operation. The first was in 1941 and lasted 15 days. The second, involving just miners, happened in 1955 and lasted 36 days. The third strike lasted from June 12 to November 12, 1971. The fourth, final and longest strike lasted from March 15 to October 2, 1973.\n\n'''Mine fatalities'''\n\nBetween 1927 and 1984, the years of Asarco mining at Buchans, a total of twenty-three men lost their lives in accidents. The majority of these deaths occurred in the earlier years of the operations.\n\n== Transportation links ==\n[[File:Buchans Lake.png|thumbnail|Buchans Lake]]\n'''Initial years'''\n\nAND co purchased the [[Millertown Railway]]<ref>[http://gfwheritagesociety.ca/media-library/photo-library/woods-department-millertown-harpoon-railway-september-1956/ Millertown Railway photo]</ref><ref>[http://www.trainweb.org/oldtimetrains/nfld/millertown.htm Millertown Railway]</ref> in 1910, which had been constructed in 1900 and linked to the [[Newfoundland Railway]] at [[Millertown Junction, Newfoundland and Labrador|Millertown Junction]]. Almost all travel to the Buchans River site prior to the fall of 1927 was by rail to Millertown on the Millertown railway then by boat to Buchans Landing on the north shore of Red Indian Lake, then by foot or mechanized vehicle over a rough corduroy road to Buchans. Prospectors and other early visitors probably walked/portaged along Buchans River from its mouth.\n\n'''Railway and highway'''\n\nIn the fall of 1927, the Buchans Railway connected the town to the outside world. This railway joined the Milltertown Railway at Four Mile Siding, near Mary March Brook, which would become the community of Buchans Junction. All concentrate was shipped by train to the port of [[Botwood]] until the railway closed in 1977. A route for a highway to Buchans was surveyed in 1948. The highway itself was completed and opened in 1956. In the final years of the [[Asarco]] operation (1977\u20131984), Buchans concentrate was trucked to Botwood by Cook's Transport Ltd. From the port of Botwood the ore would be sent to smelters all over the world. The Buchans railway bed remains a popular [[Rail trail|trail]] for ATVs and snowmobiles.\n\n'''Air'''\n\nAn Airstrip was constructed east of Buchans Lake in 1942. It was constructed initially by the Canadian Department of Transport with the permission of the government of the Dominion of Newfoundland for use by the Canadian Department of National Defence. Its two gravel runways were maintained by a small resident staff until 1965. At that time, most of the buildings and equipment at the site were removed; the three houses for airstrip staff were relocated to Buchans. Eastern Provincial Airways also briefly included Buchans as a stop/destination on one of its routes\u2014this occurred in the summer of 1956. While the northwest runway was rarely used even between 1942 and 1965 (drainage issues with the site), and fell into complete disrepair at the end of that period, the southwest-northeast runway has been repaired from time to time for use in more recent decades.\n\nAsarco also made use of Buchans Lake as a base for various float-planes over the years. These planes were used for transportation and to supply mineral exploration camps in the region. In later years, road access and helicopters were preferred for such work. A Hangar was constructed near the Buchans dam. Among the bush planes based there between the 1950s and 1970s were the de Havilland Otter and later the de Havilland Beaver. The Hangar was demolished in the early 1990s.\n\n'''Major secondary access roads'''\n\nIn the 1960s, a road was extended from the Buchans Highway (at a point near Buchans River) to provide access to resources located near the north shores of Red Indian Lake. Known locally as the \"New Road\", this road initially extended as far as Star River. Its extension, improvement and the addition of new bridges led to its connection to the Burgeo Highway (Route 480). Several studies have explored and recommended the upgrade of this route to have a provincial class highway connecting routes 480 and 370. These studies include reports of the Government of Newfoundland's Buchans Task Force in 1976 and the Buchans Action Committee in the early 1980s. The \"New Road\" as it stands has provided access for pulpwood cutting, tourism, fishing, hunting, aquaculture, silviculture, mineral exploration, as well as access to the Star Lake Hydroelectric Development. When passable, it still provides access for local residents and visitors to the Lloyd's Valley and Southwest Brook areas.\n\nThe Construction of the Hinds Lake hydroelectric project in 1980 led to the extension of a gravel road north from the Buchans Airstrip to Hinds Dike at the southernmost end of Hinds Lake. Forest access roads extending from near the community of Howley are now only a few miles from this road. This general route has been considered for a possible upgrade to allow for a provincial class highway connection between routes 401 and 370. While the Buchans to Hinds Lake road is less passable, these access roads are used by hunters, outfitters, snowmobilers, ATV users and other outdoors enthusiasts.\n\n== Early Town History ==\n'''Company Town'''\n\nMost of the employees working on the development of the mine, construction of the town, and construction of the railway were housed in temporary camps. The first worker's home in Buchans was completed on March 13, 1927; twenty-six homes were completed by the end of that year. By the time of first concentrate production in September 1928, there were 56 housing units, an apartment house, a staff house, hospital, a town hall, and several bunkhouses in the town. Several businesses including a retail store, a laundromat and a barber shop had also been established. Both the company and the Roman Catholic Church opened schools in the town. In 1929, the company constructed tennis courts, a ski run, an athletic field, and, in winter months, converted one of its concentrate sheds into a skating rink. Buchans had running water, sewage, electricity, and other services in place by 1928. The town would grow in size and prosper throughout the next few decades. From 1927 until the late 1970s, most town services and infrastructure were administered directly by the company. Company support, subsidization and direction also continued during that time for most of the town's major recreational services.\n\n'''Municipal History'''\n\nAfter the Buchans highway was opened in 1956, several families who wished to own their own houses independent of the company-administered town settled on the banks of the Buchans River at the point where the highway crossed it, in a settlement known as \"Pigeon Inlet.\" This settlement was named after the fictional community of \"Pigeon Inlet\" created by Newfoundland writer Ted Russell. In 1963 these houses were re-located to a subdivision on the southeast corner of town. The subdivision, which became known as \"Townsite\" became the Local Improvement District of Buchans. Residents of \"Townsite\" owned their own homes and managed municipal affairs independently of Asarco. On October 1, 1978, the company town became a separate local improvement district. The two municipal governments merged to form the first democratically elected municipal government for the entire town on June 18, 1979.\n\n'''Hockey'''\n\nHockey, including school hockey and town and plant internal leagues had been a major recreational activity in Buchans going back to the 1930s. Games were played on nearby ponds, and eventually of the two large Asarco ore sheds on the north side of the town was converted each season into a skating/hockey rink.\n\nBuchans was among the towns on the island to compete for the [[Herder Memorial Trophy]], fielding senior teams from the 1930s through to 1969. The Buchans Miners senior hockey team won the Herder in 1950, 1951, 1952, 1954, and 1963. A Buchans team of one name or another also was runner-up for the trophy in 1937, 1940, 1948, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1964, 1968 and 1969. In addition to exceptional local talent, the Buchans Miners hockey dynasty attracted marquis \"import\" players from various parts of Newfoundland as well as from as far away as Kirkland Lake Ontario and parts of industrial Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.\n\nBuchans Minor Hockey Association sported impressive local Pee-Wee and Bantam leagues. From the 1960s through the early 1980s, Buchans Atom, Pee-Wee, Bantam and Midget teams frequently won championships in NAHA's B divisions. There was also a brief resurgence of championship wins in E-H divisions for Pee-Wee, Bantam and Midget teams from Buchans in the 1990s.\n\n== Final years of Asarco operation ==\nOn 17 March 1976 Asarco Incorporated, Buchans Unit and Price (Nfld.) Pulp and Paper Limited (Incorporated in 1962 replacing AND co - would later become Abitibi-Price then Abitibi-Bowater) signed a new contract whereby Price repossessed its original mineral exploration rights over the entire 1905 A.N.D. Co. concession area except for the mine site. The two companies agreed to continue sharing the profits from the existing mines and from any future mines developed on deposits discovered by ASARCO prior to March 1976.\n\nIn 1980/1981, Asarco also mined a 2,000+ ton bulk sample by way of an adit developed at the Tulks Hill Lead-Zinc orebody near the southwestern corner of Red Indian Lake. (This prospect, with between 600,000 and 800,000 tons of recoverable ore, as of June 2017, had not yet been mined).\n\nIn 1977 Asarco began to divest itself of company owned houses and community infrastructure. Asarco shut all mining operations at its Buchans Unit in 1982 with only 12 workers remaining on the property, down from 550 in 1978. Mining resumed briefly in 1983 and 1984 at the MacLean extension and at Oriental Mine where some ore was mined from two pits near Oriental Mine shaft. All mining production ceased in September 1984. 17.5 million tons were mined and processed over the 55-year history of mining at Buchans.  ASARCO also closed its remaining barite recovery operation, which had operated seasonally in the early 1980s.\n\n== Buchans since 1984 ==\nIn the years since the closure of the Asarco operation, the population of the town, which had fluctuated but remained between 2,500 and 3,000 throughout the most prosperous years of the mine, began to drop in the late 1970s as ore reserves dwindled, production declined and layoffs occurred. By 1985, the population had decreased to 1,500. The 2011 Canadian Census reported the population of Buchans to be 696.\n\nConsiderable environmental remediation work and study continued after Asarco's initial work on tailings revegetation in the mid-1970s. This work was also complemented with a multitide of studies, water and soil monitoring activities, and mine site decommissioning/demolition projects throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Few of the mine site(s)' structures remain. Most of those that do remain are now used by other enterprises in the area. While Asarco maintained a consultancy presence until the early 2000s, most of the responsibility for ongoing remediation and monitoring belonged to Abitibi-Price (later called Abitibi Consolidated and later still Abitibi Bowater). Companies including but not limited to Amec and Boojum have studied the area and aided in the remediation efforts. Most of Abitibi Bowater's assets in Newfoundland were expropriated by the government of Newfoundland and Labrador in December 2008 and Abitibi Bowater later filed for Creditor Protection in 2009. With expropriation, responsibility for the land and assets in the Red Indian Lake watershed area, including Buchans, mostly came to rest with the provincial government's crown corporation -  Nalcor.\n\nIn recent months and years, in light of the financial difficulties of involved companies and some community interest, the provincial government has taken a renewed interest in one of the remaining stages of Buchans mine remediation - an older \"tailings spill\" area located to the southwest of the Town. Testing of one of the samples from this tailings area re-confirmed the (expected) presence of lead, one of the metals mined at Buchans. As a precautionary step, in 2009, provincial officials asked residents to be tested for lead levels in their blood. This testing yielded no results warranting further medical attention and no health risks were found. The 2010 Newfoundland and Labrador budget included $4 million to aid in the beautification, final cleanup and additional remediation of this site. This work was completed between 2010 and 2013.\n\nThere has been intermittent renewed private interest in the recycling of mine tailings to remove Barite for use in engineering services related to offshore drilling. A reorganized version of the Barite recycling operation first attempted by Asarco in the early 1980s, prepared and tested by another group in the late 2025s, did operate under Pennecon in 2009 and intermittently under another partnership in the mid 2010s. The tailings ponds near the Lucky Strike mine site contain millions of tons of material that is 30% barite.\n\nIn the years since the Asarco mine closure, many businesses continue to thrive in the town of Buchans. It remains a tourist destination - especially for people interested in fishing, hunting, hiking, other outdoor activities or learning about the town's rich mining heritage.\n\nMany Buchans expatriates return often and maintain a strong connection with their hometown. In 1986, the Town of Buchans held the first \"Come Home Year\" festival to encourage former residents to return and celebrate the town's rich history and heritage. Come Home Year festivals have more recently been held every five years, in the summers of 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012. The 2017 Come Home Year event marked 90 years since the formation of the town of Buchans. A shorter festival, known as the \"Lucky Strike Festival\" has been held annually in July during the years between Come Home Year festivals. Fundraising efforts at these events, as well as others such as the annual \"Save Our Plant\" (SOP) curling bonspiel help ensure that the residents of Buchans are able to continue to maintain and enjoy many of the exceptional recreational facilities and amenities established during the Asarco mining era.\n\n==Climate==\nAs typical of Newfoundland, Buchans has a [[humid continental climate]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=40827&cityname=Buchans%2C+Newfoundland%2C+Canada&units=|title=Buchans, Newfoundland, Canada Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref> with maritime influences.
