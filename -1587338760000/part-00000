It was the first to be operated in the [[United States]], and one of the first locomotives to operate outside [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It takes its name from the [[Lion|lion's]] face painted on the front, and [[Stourbridge]] in England, where it was manufactured by the firm Foster, Rastrick and Company in 1829.<ref name=\"Bailey, Rastrick\" /> The locomotive, obtained by the [[Delaware and Hudson|Delaware & Hudson Canal Company]], was shipped to New York in May 1829, where it was tested raised on blocks. It was then taken to [[Honesdale, Pennsylvania]] for testing on the company's newly built track. The locomotive performed well in its first test in August 1829 but was found to be too heavy for the track and was never used for its intended purpose of hauling coal wagons. During the next few decades a number of parts were removed from the abandoned locomotive until only the boiler and a few other components remained. These were acquired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1890 and are currently on display at the  [[B&O Railroad Museum]] in [[Baltimore]].\n\n==History==\nOne of the [[Oldest railroads in North America|first railroads in the United States]], the [[Delaware and Hudson|Delaware & Hudson Canal Company]] (D&H), was originally chartered in 1823 to build and operate canals between [[New York City]] and the coal fields around [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania]]. While the line was originally planned as a canal for the entire route, company engineers began thinking about rail transportation as early as 1825; the initial plan was to build a railroad between the mines and the western end of the canal as a way to get the coal to the canal boats.\n\n[[John B. Jervis]], who later became the designer of the [[4-2-0]] (the ''Jervis'' type) locomotive, was named the D&H's chief engineer in 1827. Jervis planned out a series of inclines connected by level, but themselves disconnected, railroads. The company directors liked Jervis's plan and authorized its construction with some hesitation for the as-yet unproven railroad technology.\n\nIn 1828, a former coworker of Jervis, [[Horatio Allen]], went on a railroad research tour of England. Through Allen, Jervis sent specifications for locomotives that could be used on the D&H. Allen wrote back in July that four locomotives had been ordered, three from [[Foster, Rastrick and Company]] and one from [[Robert Stephenson and Company]], for the D&H.\n\n''Stourbridge Lion'' was one of these three locomotives built by Rastrick, but Stephenson's shop had completed their locomotive, the ''Pride of Newcastle'', before any of Rastrick's locomotives. The ''Pride of Newcastle'' even arrived in America nearly two months before the ''Stourbridge Lion'', but it was the latter that was used for the first railroad trials. The price on delivery of the ''Stourbridge Lion'' was $2914.90, equal to ${{Inflation|US|2914.9|1829}} today. <ref name=\"Smithsonian\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bulletinunitedst2101956unit|title=The First Quarter-century of Steam Locomotives in North America|last=Oliver|first=Smith Hempstone|last2=|last3=|date=|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press, [etc.]|others=|year=1956|isbn=|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bulletinunitedst2101956unit/page/14 14]-21}}</ref> \n\nThe locomotive was transported from [[Liverpool]] aboard the ship ''John Jay'', arriving at New York in mid-May 1829.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> It was assembled at the [[West Point Foundry]] in New York where it was first tested under steam.

The four locomotives were used as sources of English wrought-iron [[bar stock]] until the middle of the 1840s.\n\nBy 1845, all that was left of the ''Stourbridge Lion'' was its boiler. The boiler was still functional, however, and it was used in a foundry in Carbondale for about another five years until the foundry's owner headed west to try his luck as a [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|Forty-niner]]. The foundry was sold a few years later to new owners who recognized the boiler's value as a piece of history, and reportedly tried to sell it for $1,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1874}}}} today) in 1874. The owners weren't able to find a buyer so they hung onto it themselves.\n\nIn 1883, the D&H borrowed the boiler to display at the [[Exposition of Railway Appliances]] in [[Chicago]]. Unfortunately, security around the boiler's transportation was lax; souvenir hunters pulled every loose item that they could off the now historic boiler, even resorting to hammers and chisels to remove portions of it.\n[[File:Honesdale, Pennsylvania (4095370872) (3).jpg|thumb|right|A plaque commemorating the ''Stourbridge Lion'' at Honesdale, Pennsylvania]] \nThe boiler was stored again and eventually acquired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1890.

It was originally hosted by [[Robin Ray]] and later, most notably, by [[Robert Robinson (broadcaster)|Robert Robinson]]. Its most prominent panelist was [[Frank Muir]].\n\nExamples of words used in the show, taken from a 1972 book published in connection with the show, include: queach, strongle, ablewhacket, hickboo, jargoon, zurf, morepork, and jirble. \"Queach\", for instance, was defined as \"a malicious caricature\", \"a cross between a quince and a peach\" and \"a mini-jungle of mixed vegetation\". The first and second of those particular definitions were bluffs.\n\nThe theme music for the show was ''Ciccolino'' by [[Norrie Paramor]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Call_My_Bluff |title=Call My Bluff |website=UKGameshows |access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\n''Call My Bluff'' originally aired on [[BBC2]] from 17 October 1965 to 22 December 1988. The original host was [[Robin Ray]].\n\n[[Robert Morley]] and [[Frank Muir]] captained the teams. Morley was later succeeded by [[Patrick Campbell, 3rd Baron Glenavy|Patrick Campbell]], and [[Arthur Marshall (broadcaster)|Arthur Marshall]] took over upon Campbell's death. Various celebrities also stood in as team captains, including [[Kenneth Horne]], [[Kenneth Williams]] and [[Alan Melville (writer)|Alan Melville]]. The original series finished after Marshall's death, although a general change in the tone and atmosphere of broadcasting at the time may also have affected its temporary demise. The final host for this run was [[Robert Robinson (broadcaster)|Robert Robinson]].\n\nThe show was resurrected in 1996 after an eight-year rest (apart from one special edition on 16 April 1994 for BBC Two's thirtieth birthday, which still featured Robert Robinson, but this time with [[Joanna Lumley]] as a team captain opposite Frank Muir), now as a daytime series on [[BBC1]]. It began airing on 13 May 1996 with [[Alan Coren]] and [[Sandi Toksvig]] as the team captains and [[Bob Holness]] replacing Robinson as chairman.\n\nIn 2003, Toksvig was replaced by the journalist [[Rod Liddle]], and [[News presenter|newsreader]] [[Fiona Bruce]] took the chair. The series finished again on 17 July 2005.\n\n''Call My Bluff'' returned for a special during the BBC's ''[[24 Hour Panel People]]'' in aid for ''[[Comic Relief 2011]]'', with [[Alex Horne]], [[Roisin Conaty]], [[Russell Tovey]], [[Tim Key]], [[Sarah Cawood]] and [[David Walliams]] participating. The host was [[Angus Deayton]].\n\n==Transmissions==\n===BBC2===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Series !! Start date !! End date !!

It was originally hosted by [[Robin Ray]] and later, most notably, by [[Robert Robinson (broadcaster)|Robert Robinson]]. Its most prominent panelist was [[Frank Muir]].\n\nExamples of words used in the show, taken from a 1972 book published in connection with the show, include: queach, strongle, ablewhacket, hickboo, jargoon, zurf, morepork, and jirble. \"Queach\", for instance, was defined as \"a malicious caricature\", \"a cross between a quince and a peach\" and \"a mini-jungle of mixed vegetation\". The first and second of those particular definitions were bluffs.\n\nThe theme music for the show was ''Ciccolino'' by [[Norrie Paramor]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Call_My_Bluff |title=Call My Bluff |website=UKGameshows |access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\n''Call My Bluff'' originally aired on [[BBC2]] from 17 October 1965 to 22 December 1988. The original host was [[Robin Ray]].\n\n[[Robert Morley]] and [[Frank Muir]] captained the teams. Morley was later succeeded by [[Patrick Campbell, 3rd Baron Glenavy|Patrick Campbell]], and [[Arthur Marshall (broadcaster)|Arthur Marshall]] took over upon Campbell's death. Various celebrities also stood in as team captains, including [[Kenneth Horne]], [[Kenneth Williams]] and [[Alan Melville (writer)|Alan Melville]]. The original series finished after Marshall's death, although a general change in the tone and atmosphere of broadcasting at the time may also have affected its temporary demise. The final host for this run was [[Robert Robinson (broadcaster)|Robert Robinson]].\n\nThe show was resurrected in 1996 after an eight-year rest (apart from one special edition on 16 April 1994 for BBC Two's thirtieth birthday, which still featured Robert Robinson, but this time with [[Joanna Lumley]] as a team captain opposite Frank Muir), now as a daytime series on [[BBC1]]. It began airing on 13 May 1996 with [[Alan Coren]] and [[Sandi Toksvig]] as the team captains and [[Bob Holness]] replacing Robinson as chairman.\n\nIn 2003, Toksvig was replaced by the journalist [[Rod Liddle]], and [[News presenter|newsreader]] [[Fiona Bruce]] took the chair. The series finished again on 17 July 2005.\n\n''Call My Bluff'' returned for a special during the BBC's ''[[24 Hour Panel People]]'' in aid for ''[[Comic Relief 2011]]'', with [[Alex Horne]], [[Roisin Conaty]], [[Russell Tovey]], [[Tim Key]], [[Sarah Cawood]] and [[David Walliams]] participating. The host was [[Angus Deayton]].\n\n==Transmissions==\n===BBC2===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Series !! Start date !! End date !!

It is the second installment of the [[Call of Duty|''Call of Duty'' series]]. Announced by Activision on April 7, 2005, the game was released on October 25, 2005 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and on November 22, 2005<ref name=\"NA\"/> as a launch title for the [[Xbox 360]]. Other versions were eventually released for [[MacOS|OS X]], [[mobile phone]]s, and [[Pocket PC]]s.\n\nThe game is set during [[World War II]] and the campaign mode is experienced through the perspectives of four soldiers: one in the [[Red Army]], one in the [[United States Army]], and two in the [[British Army]]. It contains four individual campaigns, split into three stories, with a total of 27 missions. Many features were added and changed from the original ''[[Call of Duty (video game)|Call of Duty]]'', notably [[Health (gaming)#Recharging health|regenerating health]] and an icon that indicates a nearby [[grenade]] about to explode.\n\nThe game drew critical praise, particularly for the graphics, sound and the regenerating health system. As a [[launch game]], the Xbox 360 version sold over 250,000 copies in its first week, and had sold over 2 million copies by January 2008. By November 2013, the game had sold over 5.9 million copies.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Callofduty2pointeduhoc.jpg|thumb|left|The Pointe du Hoc D-Day mission in the single-player campaign depicts [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Rangers]] going ashore in  [[LCVP (United States)|LCVP]] landing craft.]]\n''Call of Duty 2 ''is a first-person shooter that has a single-player story mode and a multiplayer mode.

The next level involves the destruction of a German stronghold in [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] during September 1942. The next objective involves battling for strongholds throughout Stalingrad throughout December 1942, including re-connecting cut telephone wires and re-capturing the rail-yard and train-station. The final mission takes place during the final Soviet offensive in Stalingrad in January 1943, which involves the re-capture and defense of city blocks and Stalingrad city hall.\n\n===British campaign===\nThe player controls a British soldier, Sergeant John Davis of the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] in [[North Africa]], led by Captain Price. The first level has the player taking part in a sneak attack on German [[Afrika Korps]] troops, ending with the destruction of a German supply station. The next level has the player defending a town from overwhelming numbers of Germans sending counter attacks from North, West, South and East; finally achieving victory by destroying much of the German tank force using artillery. This is followed by the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]], during which the player has to fight through several [[Trench warfare|trenches]], machine gun nests, 88&nbsp;millimeter guns and finally taking the German field headquarters. The assault on [[El Dabaa]] to intercept the remaining Germans in [[Egypt]] and destroy several 88&nbsp;millimeter guns soon follows, ending the first British campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/features/6136916/p-5.html|publisher=GameSpot|title=Call of Duty 2 British Campaign Walkthrough|accessdate=July 19, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929145957/http://au.gamespot.com/features/6136916/p-5.html|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> An [[addendum]] to the second set of missions has the player taking on the role of a British tank commander, David Welsh, while engaging enemies in [[Italian Libya|Libya]]. The first mission of the third campaign in [[Toujane]], [[Tunisia]], has the player immediately under fire, holding a house until they break out and rendezvous with the second squad. They then retake Toujane with reinforcements the next day all before assaulting [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]]. The final British campaign takes place during the [[Battle for Caen]] as part of [[Operation Overlord]].\n\n===American campaign===\nAs Corporal Bill Taylor of the [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd Ranger Battalion]], the player starts off by playing a part in [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]], at the assault of [[Pointe du Hoc]], to destroy a German [[artillery battery]], and hold it against a massive German [[counter-offensive]] in the following mission. Soon after, the player captures a nearby town and serves as a sniper against [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] crews until reinforcements arrive. The second objective is focused on [[Hill 400, Bergstein|Hill 400]], involving the capture of Bergstein, a disastrous charge at Hill 400's bunkers and the defense against the German [[counterattack]], with the player again performing [[sniper]] work against German mortar teams, destroying enemy armor, and generally holding the hill against the counter-offensive, all the while burdened by artillery and overwhelming numbers of German soldiers. The final mission is set amongst the Americans in the [[Operation Plunder|Rhine River crossing]] into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. It begins as one of the few missions with the player immediately under fire, providing cover fire against the Germans until reaching the river banks and then fighting through most of the town. The final fight has the player defeat two German [[Tiger I]]'s.\n\n===Ending===\nThe end credits depict the dramatic rescue of Captain Price from the Germans by a group of American soldiers. After the credits end, the words \"No cows were harmed in the making of this game\" appear, as in the original ''Call of Duty''.

It had been speculated that Infinity Ward was developing the sequel at the same time as [[Gray Matter Interactive]] developed ''Call of Duty: United Offensive''. Infinity Ward president Grant Collier said:\n\n{{quote|\"Our team at Infinity Ward is committed to thrusting gamers into the heat of battle like no other, taking players on a thrill-ride of adrenaline that leaves everyone gasping for air. In ''Call of Duty 2'', we are creating the most intense and realistic action game imaginable with a stunning visual atmosphere and an advanced technology that delivers an unprecedented level of authenticity\".<ref name=\"a\"/>}}\n\nThe press release said players would engage enemies in a less linear battlefield, tackle the major battles chronologically, and use squad tactics not available in previous ''Call of Duty'' games. Infinity Ward also confirmed making a \"Battle Chatter System\", similar to ''[[Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault]]'', where squad members converse to create situational awareness.<ref name=\"a\">{{cite web|first=Tom|last=McNamara|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/602/602416p1.html|title=Call of Duty 2 Announced|publisher=IGN|date=April 7, 2005|accessdate=August 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[game engine]]\u2014proprietary [[IW engine]] 2.0\u2014is a modified version of [[id Tech 3]], which was used in the first ''Call of Duty'' game. With the new game engine, Infinity Ward expanded the scope of combat to deliver a realistic battlefield experience and improved the visuals.

Players have the freedom to follow each of the four storylines through for the ultimate character-driven experience, or they can engage in the historic battles chronologically for quick hitting action.

Vince Zampella, creative director of Infinity Ward, said, \"We didn't want to take any of the parts out that made ''Call of Duty'' so good. But there were a couple of things that we admit could have been done better\". A demo of the game showed a more open gameplay style and a better AI for the enemies, who would actively go after the player. There are a set number of enemies set on the map that will begin reacting to the player's presence once the first shot has been fired. Groups of enemies farther away send units up to see what is happening and add to the combat while enemies directly in front of the player will join in and take cover quickly.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Adams|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/606/606045p1.html|title=Call of Duty 2 - PC Preview at IGN|publisher=IGN|page=1|date=April 20, 2005|accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nInfinity Ward spent a lot of time on WWII battlefields, which led them to scrap whole levels for parts of the game that took place in France, since they found the location a lot different than what they imagined.\n\nOne of the details the team added are post-war effects that continue on the battlefield throughout the game, where dust and smoke continue to roll through the streets, clouding up vision, and junk and [[debris]] scattered everywhere. The game has sound attenuation, with a 5.1 [[surround sound]] system, and context sensitive dialog, with a total of twenty-thousand lines of dialog. Each of the soldiers fighting alongside the player will call out the position of enemy soldiers, warn of [[Flanking maneuver|flank attack]]s, and help out in ways that were not possible in the first game of the series. Zampella said, \"We really wanted realistic battle chatter going that's not only entertaining, but actually adds to the gaming experience. So now you'll hear your guys telling you that there's [sic] two guys hiding behind that rusty car in the street or that there are people on the second floor of a building\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Adams|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/606/606045p2.html|title=Call of Duty 2 - PC Preview at IGN|publisher=IGN|page=2|date=April 20, 2005|accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nA small grayed-out grenade icon appears in the center of the screen when the player is near a grenade, with an arrow pointing in the direction of the grenade.

Other versions were eventually released for [[MacOS|OS X]], [[mobile phone]]s, and [[Pocket PC]]s.\n\nThe game is set during [[World War II]] and the campaign mode is experienced through the perspectives of four soldiers: one in the [[Red Army]], one in the [[United States Army]], and two in the [[British Army]]. It contains four individual campaigns, split into three stories, with a total of 27 missions. Many features were added and changed from the original ''[[Call of Duty (video game)|Call of Duty]]'', notably [[Health (gaming)#Recharging health|regenerating health]] and an icon that indicates a nearby [[grenade]] about to explode.\n\nThe game drew critical praise, particularly for the graphics, sound and the regenerating health system. As a [[launch game]], the Xbox 360 version sold over 250,000 copies in its first week, and had sold over 2 million copies by January 2008. By November 2013, the game had sold over 5.9 million copies.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Callofduty2pointeduhoc.jpg|thumb|left|The Pointe du Hoc D-Day mission in the single-player campaign depicts [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Rangers]] going ashore in  [[LCVP (United States)|LCVP]] landing craft.]]\n''Call of Duty 2 ''is a first-person shooter that has a single-player story mode and a multiplayer mode.

The next level involves the destruction of a German stronghold in [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] during September 1942. The next objective involves battling for strongholds throughout Stalingrad throughout December 1942, including re-connecting cut telephone wires and re-capturing the rail-yard and train-station. The final mission takes place during the final Soviet offensive in Stalingrad in January 1943, which involves the re-capture and defense of city blocks and Stalingrad city hall.\n\n===British campaign===\nThe player controls a British soldier, Sergeant John Davis of the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] in [[North Africa]], led by Captain Price. The first level has the player taking part in a sneak attack on German [[Afrika Korps]] troops, ending with the destruction of a German supply station. The next level has the player defending a town from overwhelming numbers of Germans sending counter attacks from North, West, South and East; finally achieving victory by destroying much of the German tank force using artillery. This is followed by the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]], during which the player has to fight through several [[Trench warfare|trenches]], machine gun nests, 88&nbsp;millimeter guns and finally taking the German field headquarters. The assault on [[El Dabaa]] to intercept the remaining Germans in [[Egypt]] and destroy several 88&nbsp;millimeter guns soon follows, ending the first British campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/features/6136916/p-5.html|publisher=GameSpot|title=Call of Duty 2 British Campaign Walkthrough|accessdate=July 19, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929145957/http://au.gamespot.com/features/6136916/p-5.html|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> An [[addendum]] to the second set of missions has the player taking on the role of a British tank commander, David Welsh, while engaging enemies in [[Italian Libya|Libya]]. The first mission of the third campaign in [[Toujane]], [[Tunisia]], has the player immediately under fire, holding a house until they break out and rendezvous with the second squad. They then retake Toujane with reinforcements the next day all before assaulting [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]]. The final British campaign takes place during the [[Battle for Caen]] as part of [[Operation Overlord]].\n\n===American campaign===\nAs Corporal Bill Taylor of the [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd Ranger Battalion]], the player starts off by playing a part in [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]], at the assault of [[Pointe du Hoc]], to destroy a German [[artillery battery]], and hold it against a massive German [[counter-offensive]] in the following mission. Soon after, the player captures a nearby town and serves as a sniper against [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] crews until reinforcements arrive. The second objective is focused on [[Hill 400, Bergstein|Hill 400]], involving the capture of Bergstein, a disastrous charge at Hill 400's bunkers and the defense against the German [[counterattack]], with the player again performing [[sniper]] work against German mortar teams, destroying enemy armor, and generally holding the hill against the counter-offensive, all the while burdened by artillery and overwhelming numbers of German soldiers. The final mission is set amongst the Americans in the [[Operation Plunder|Rhine River crossing]] into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. It begins as one of the few missions with the player immediately under fire, providing cover fire against the Germans until reaching the river banks and then fighting through most of the town. The final fight has the player defeat two German [[Tiger I]]'s.\n\n===Ending===\nThe end credits depict the dramatic rescue of Captain Price from the Germans by a group of American soldiers. After the credits end, the words \"No cows were harmed in the making of this game\" appear, as in the original ''Call of Duty''. This is a reference to the dead cattle visible in the Normandy missions.<ref name=\"Q&A\"/>\n\n==Development==\nOn April 7, 2005, Activision announced that Infinity Ward was developing ''Call of Duty 2'', set for release in fall 2005 for PC.

Vince Zampella, creative director of Infinity Ward, said, \"We didn't want to take any of the parts out that made ''Call of Duty'' so good. But there were a couple of things that we admit could have been done better\". A demo of the game showed a more open gameplay style and a better AI for the enemies, who would actively go after the player. There are a set number of enemies set on the map that will begin reacting to the player's presence once the first shot has been fired. Groups of enemies farther away send units up to see what is happening and add to the combat while enemies directly in front of the player will join in and take cover quickly.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Adams|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/606/606045p1.html|title=Call of Duty 2 - PC Preview at IGN|publisher=IGN|page=1|date=April 20, 2005|accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nInfinity Ward spent a lot of time on WWII battlefields, which led them to scrap whole levels for parts of the game that took place in France, since they found the location a lot different than what they imagined.\n\nOne of the details the team added are post-war effects that continue on the battlefield throughout the game, where dust and smoke continue to roll through the streets, clouding up vision, and junk and [[debris]] scattered everywhere. The game has sound attenuation, with a 5.1 [[surround sound]] system, and context sensitive dialog, with a total of twenty-thousand lines of dialog. Each of the soldiers fighting alongside the player will call out the position of enemy soldiers, warn of [[Flanking maneuver|flank attack]]s, and help out in ways that were not possible in the first game of the series. Zampella said, \"We really wanted realistic battle chatter going that's not only entertaining, but actually adds to the gaming experience. So now you'll hear your guys telling you that there's [sic] two guys hiding behind that rusty car in the street or that there are people on the second floor of a building\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Adams|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/606/606045p2.html|title=Call of Duty 2 - PC Preview at IGN|publisher=IGN|page=2|date=April 20, 2005|accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nA small grayed-out grenade icon appears in the center of the screen when the player is near a grenade, with an arrow pointing in the direction of the grenade.

Then on July 4, 1888, the first cornerstone was laid. On September 3, 1889, doors opened for the 90 enrolled students. The library opened on January 11, 1890 with 350 books. On June 20, 1891 the first graduation took place, a class of 15.\n\nIn 1910, [[Annie Bidwell|Annie Kennedy Bidwell]] donated an additional {{convert|2|acre|ha}} of land to be used for work with elementary agriculture.

In 1922, Chico State Teacher's College added a junior college curriculum and awarded a certificate after two years. Also in 1922, [[Bidwell Mansion State Historic Park|Bidwell Mansion]] was turned into a women's dormitory, Bidwell Hall. In 1923 the first college paper, ''The Collegian'', was published. In 1924, the state Board of Education allowed the school to grant [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degrees. Also in 1924, the [[Bobcat|wildcat]] was chosen as the [[mascot]]. In 1925 the [[alumni]] organization was founded. In 1927 a fire destroyed the Normal Building. That same year a gym was built on the grounds of Bidwell Mansion. In 1929, the cornerstone for the new administration building was laid on top of Normal Building's original cornerstone. In 1929 the student bookstore was established.\n\nIn 1935, Bidwell Hall was turned into a recreation and student center - the first student union. Also in 1935 a legislative act changed the college name from Chico State Teachers College to Chico State College. In 1937 evening classes started on campus and athletic fields were purchased from the Chico Board of Education. In 1939, chimes were installed in library tower. Sororities held a fund drive to raise $600 for them. In 1940 the college offered civilian pilot classes.\n\nIn 1948, dorms for 500 male students were set up on west side of Warner Street. The buildings were built during [[World War II]] and were used as bachelor quarters for a Marine Hospital in [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]]. They were brought to Chico State in sections and reconstructed in the spring of 1948. The two-story barrack-like structures had 36 rooms, each occupied by 4 students. North Hall later became a female [[dormitory]]. The speech and debate team was founded by Herbert Rae, Speech & Drama Department Chair.\n\nIn 1950, California's governor allowed state colleges to grant Master of Arts degrees. In 1951 the college reorganized from 18 departments into seven divisions with chairmen. Then in 1956 a new flagpost and sign in front of Kendall Hall was donated by the class of 1956. In the following year, 1957, a new [[cafeteria]] was built and the rose gardens were planted. In 1958 the first \"telecourse\" was taught, Psychology 51.\n\nKCSC, a student-run radio station, launched, broadcasting old-time radio dramas on the campus public address system in 1951.\n\n[[File:Chico State, Arts & Humanities Building, in March 2020.jpg|thumb|upright|The Arts & Humanities Building is one of the newest buildings on campus.

Faculty members are also involved in this event. This event happens annually and students look forward to it all year. Once the opening comments and the welcome occur in the Bell Memorial Union Auditorium, the participants explore different locations on campus for \"breakout sessions\". These sessions give students a chance to share their research with their peers. Students have commented saying this event has inspired them to get more involved in the community and stay educated about current politics. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.csuchico.edu/fye/events/town-hall-meeting/index.shtml|title=The CSU, Chico Town Hall Meeting|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===The Great Debate===\nThe Great Debate was created to drive members of both the campus and the community to take part in a conversation about issues that have the ability to divide the community. There is a different topic that takes place every semester. An example of a topic is Climate Change. The event requires a full day where presentations and debates take place. Students partake in active listening and respectful communication exchange. Students from Communication Studies classes are the students who give presentations based off a previously chosen topic.

Less than a month later, Chico was chosen as the location. On June 24, 1887, General [[John Bidwell]] donated {{convert|8|acre|ha}} of land from his cherry orchard. Then on July 4, 1888, the first cornerstone was laid. On September 3, 1889, doors opened for the 90 enrolled students. The library opened on January 11, 1890 with 350 books. On June 20, 1891 the first graduation took place, a class of 15.\n\nIn 1910, [[Annie Bidwell|Annie Kennedy Bidwell]] donated an additional {{convert|2|acre|ha}} of land to be used for work with elementary agriculture. The next year Mrs. Bidwell donated an orange orchard lot 55 \u00d7 {{convert|440|ft|m}} as the children's playground, which is connected to the Training School.<ref name=csuchico>{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=Mary Ellen|title=University Archives: Chico State Normal School (1887-1921)|url=http://www.csuchico.edu/lspr/time1.html|access-date=2008-01-06}}</ref> Twenty years later in 1921, legislation was enacted to change the school's name to Chico State Teacher's College. In 1922, Chico State Teacher's College added a junior college curriculum and awarded a certificate after two years. Also in 1922, [[Bidwell Mansion State Historic Park|Bidwell Mansion]] was turned into a women's dormitory, Bidwell Hall. In 1923 the first college paper, ''The Collegian'', was published. In 1924, the state Board of Education allowed the school to grant [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degrees. Also in 1924, the [[Bobcat|wildcat]] was chosen as the [[mascot]]. In 1925 the [[alumni]] organization was founded. In 1927 a fire destroyed the Normal Building. That same year a gym was built on the grounds of Bidwell Mansion. In 1929, the cornerstone for the new administration building was laid on top of Normal Building's original cornerstone. In 1929 the student bookstore was established.\n\nIn 1935, Bidwell Hall was turned into a recreation and student center - the first student union. Also in 1935 a legislative act changed the college name from Chico State Teachers College to Chico State College. In 1937 evening classes started on campus and athletic fields were purchased from the Chico Board of Education. In 1939, chimes were installed in library tower. Sororities held a fund drive to raise $600 for them. In 1940 the college offered civilian pilot classes.\n\nIn 1948, dorms for 500 male students were set up on west side of Warner Street. The buildings were built during [[World War II]] and were used as bachelor quarters for a Marine Hospital in [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]]. They were brought to Chico State in sections and reconstructed in the spring of 1948. The two-story barrack-like structures had 36 rooms, each occupied by 4 students. North Hall later became a female [[dormitory]]. The speech and debate team was founded by Herbert Rae, Speech & Drama Department Chair.\n\nIn 1950, California's governor allowed state colleges to grant Master of Arts degrees. In 1951 the college reorganized from 18 departments into seven divisions with chairmen. Then in 1956 a new flagpost and sign in front of Kendall Hall was donated by the class of 1956.
