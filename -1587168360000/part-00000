It aimed to fill the hole left in [[football in England|English football]] by the cancellation of the [[FA Cup]] during the [[Second World War]].\n\n== Background==\nThroughout the latter 1930s it was becoming inevitable that a second World War with Germany was coming.  On 3 September 1939 following Germany\u2019s invasion of Poland, [[Neville Chamberlain]] announced war on [[Nazi Germany]].\n\nShortly after war was declared, most competitions were abandoned as the country's attention turned to the war effort. Over 780 footballers signed up to fight in the war and as a result many of England's best teams were depleted \u2013 for example, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] saw 76 players sign up, [[Wolverhampton Wanderers|Wolves]] saw 91 sign up and [[Huddersfield Town FC|Huddersfield]], [[Leicester City|Leicester]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]] all saw over 60 players sign up for the war. Because of this many teams fielded guest players instead. The [[FA Cup]] Extra-Preliminary Round was played, but with hostilities declared before replays took place, and a 50-mile travelling limit, that competition too was abandoned. The Football League War Cup was held between 1939 and 1945 in an attempt to fill the gaping hole left in [[English Football]] by the cancellation of the [[FA Cup]].\n\n== Honours ==\n\n===Northern Final===\n\n{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>\n| \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n!\n!Winner\n!Finalist\n|-\n!1942\u201343\n|[[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]\n|[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] \n|-\n!1943\u201344\n|[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]\n|[[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]\n|-\n!1944\u201345\n|[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] \n|[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n===Southern Final===\n\n{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>\n| \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n!\n!Winner\n!Finalist\n|-\n!1942\u201343\n|[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] \n|[[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] \n|-\n!1943\u201344\n|[[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] \n|[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]\n|-\n!1944\u201345\n|[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] \n|[[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n===Overall final===\n\n{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>\n| \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n!\n!Winner\n!Finalist\n|-\n!1939\u201340\n|[[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]\n|[[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]\n|-\n!1940\u201341\n|[[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]\n|[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]\n|-\n!1941\u201342\n|[[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]\n|[[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]]\n|-\n!1942\u201343\n|[[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]\n|[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]\n|-\n!1943\u201344\n| [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] (shared)\n|\n|-\n!1944\u201345\n|[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]\n|[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]\n|}\n|}\n\n== Tournament finals ==\n\n=== [[1939\u201340 in English football|1939\u201340]] ===\n\n{{football box\n|date=  '''''Final.'''''\n|team1= [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]\n|score=  1\u20130\n|team2= [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]\n|goals1= [[Sam Small]] {{goal||}}\n|goals2=\n|stadium= [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], 8 June 1940.\n|attendance=42,399\n|report= \n}}\n\n137 games (including replays) were played to get to the final of the inaugural Football League War Cup.

It aimed to fill the hole left in [[football in England|English football]] by the cancellation of the [[FA Cup]] during the [[Second World War]].\n\n== Background==\nThroughout the latter 1930s it was becoming inevitable that a second World War with Germany was coming.  On 3 September 1939 following Germany\u2019s invasion of Poland, [[Neville Chamberlain]] announced war on [[Nazi Germany]].\n\nShortly after war was declared, most competitions were abandoned as the country's attention turned to the war effort. Over 780 footballers signed up to fight in the war and as a result many of England's best teams were depleted \u2013 for example, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] saw 76 players sign up, [[Wolverhampton Wanderers|Wolves]] saw 91 sign up and [[Huddersfield Town FC|Huddersfield]], [[Leicester City|Leicester]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]] all saw over 60 players sign up for the war. Because of this many teams fielded guest players instead. The [[FA Cup]] Extra-Preliminary Round was played, but with hostilities declared before replays took place, and a 50-mile travelling limit, that competition too was abandoned. The Football League War Cup was held between 1939 and 1945 in an attempt to fill the gaping hole left in [[English Football]] by the cancellation of the [[FA Cup]].\n\n== Honours ==\n\n===Northern Final===\n\n{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>\n| \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n!\n!Winner\n!Finalist\n|-\n!1942\u201343\n|[[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]\n|[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] \n|-\n!1943\u201344\n|[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]\n|[[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]\n|-\n!1944\u201345\n|[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] \n|[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n===Southern Final===\n\n{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>\n| \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n!\n!Winner\n!Finalist\n|-\n!1942\u201343\n|[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] \n|[[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] \n|-\n!1943\u201344\n|[[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] \n|[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]\n|-\n!1944\u201345\n|[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] \n|[[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n===Overall final===\n\n{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>\n| \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n!\n!Winner\n!Finalist\n|-\n!1939\u201340\n|[[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]\n|[[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]\n|-\n!1940\u201341\n|[[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]\n|[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]\n|-\n!1941\u201342\n|[[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]\n|[[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]]\n|-\n!1942\u201343\n|[[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]\n|[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]\n|-\n!1943\u201344\n| [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] (shared)\n|\n|-\n!1944\u201345\n|[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]\n|[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]\n|}\n|}\n\n== Tournament finals ==\n\n=== [[1939\u201340 in English football|1939\u201340]] ===\n\n{{football box\n|date=  '''''Final.'''''\n|team1= [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]\n|score=  1\u20130\n|team2= [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]\n|goals1= [[Sam Small]] {{goal||}}\n|goals2=\n|stadium= [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], 8 June 1940.\n|attendance=42,399\n|report= \n}}\n\n137 games (including replays) were played to get to the final of the inaugural Football League War Cup.

They inhabit a contiguous region in the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] and the eastern [[Alps]], and in the modern era are geographically separated from the body of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] and [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] people by the [[Romanians]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], and [[Austrians]] in between. The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state.

Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities. Their influence in the Balkans however diminished by the early 7th century and they were finally defeated and disappeared as a power at the turn of the 9th century by [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and the [[Frankish Empire]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=29\u201343}} The first South Slavic polity and regional power was [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], a state formed in 681 as a union between the much numerous [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavic]] [[Sclaveni|tribes]] and the [[bulgars]] of [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Khan Asparuh]].

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations. Southern-Slavic populations (Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, and northern Croats) are\ngenetically distinct from their northern linguistic relatives.<ref name=\"R\u0119ba\u0142a ''et al.'' 2007\">{{cite journal | pmid = 17364156 | year = 2007 | last1 = Reba\u0142a | first1 = K | last2 = Mikulich | first2 = AI | last3 = Tsybovsky | first3 = IS | last4 = Siv\u00e1kov\u00e1 | first4 = D | last5 = Dzupinkov\u00e1 | first5 = Z | last6 = Szczerkowska-Dobosz | first6 = A | last7 = Szczerkowska | first7 = Z | title = Y-STR variation among Slavs: Evidence for the Slavic homeland in the middle Dnieper basin | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 406\u201314 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-007-0125-6 | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | doi-access = free }}</ref> A 2008 study concluded that except for some isolated communities, Europeans are somewhat genetically homogeneous, and individual population groups are often closely related to their immediate neighbours (irrespective of language or ethnicity).<ref>{{Citation |last=Novembre |first=J |last2=Johnson |first2=T |last3=Bryc |first3=K |title=Genes mirror geography within Europe |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7218 |pages=98\u2013101 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18758442 |doi=10.1038/nature07331 |pmc=2735096|bibcode = 2008Natur.456...98N |displayauthors=1 |last4=Kutalik |last5=Boyko |first5=AR |last6=Auton |first6=A |last7=Indap |first7=A |last8=King |first8=KS |last9=Bergmann |first9=S |last10=Nelson |first10=MR |last11=Stephens |first11=M |last12=Bustamante|first12=CD}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |vauthors=Lao O, Lu TT, Nothnagel M, etal |title=Correlation between genetic and geographic structure in Europe |journal=Curr.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in

They inhabit a contiguous region in the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] and the eastern [[Alps]], and in the modern era are geographically separated from the body of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] and [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] people by the [[Romanians]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], and [[Austrians]] in between. The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state. From this idea emerged [[Yugoslavia]], which however did not include [[Bulgaria]].\n\n==History==\n{{Hatnote|'Slavic invasion of the Balkans' redirects here.}}\n===Early South Slavs===\n {{main article|Early Slavs|Sclaveni}}\n\nThe Proto-Slavic [[Urheimat|homeland]] is the area of Slavic settlement in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] during the first millennium AD, with its precise location debated by archaeologists, ethnographers and historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|pp=525\u2013526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=37}}</ref> None of the proposed homelands reaches the [[Volga River]] in the east, over the [[Dinaric Alps]] in the southwest or the [[Balkan Mountains]] in the south, or past [[Bohemia]] in the west.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|p=526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=332}}</ref> Traditionally, scholars put it in the marshes of Ukraine, or alternatively between the [[Bug River|Bug]] and the [[Dnieper]];{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=25}} however, according to F. Curta, the homeland of the southern Slavs mentioned by 6th-century writers was just north of the [[Lower Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=56}} Little is known about the Slavs before the 5th century, when they began to spread out in all directions.\n\n[[Jordanes]], [[Procopius]] and other [[Late Antiquity|late Roman]] authors provide the probable earliest references to southern Slavs in the second half of the 6th century.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=71\u201373}} Procopius described the [[Sclaveni]] and [[Antes (people)|Antes]] as two barbarian peoples with the same institutions and customs since ancient times, not ruled by a single leader but living under democracy,<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}}</ref> while Pseudo-Maurice called them a numerous people, undisciplined, unorganized and leaderless, who did not allow enslavement and conquest, and resistant to hardship, bearing all weathers.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|pp=524\u2013525}} They were portrayed by Procopius as unusually tall and strong, of dark skin and \"reddish\" hair (neither [[blond]] nor [[black hair|black]]), leading a primitive life and living in scattered huts, often changing their residence.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}} Procopius said they were [[henotheistic]], believing in the god of lightning ([[Perun]]), the ruler of all, to whom they sacrificed cattle.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}} They went into battle on foot, charging straight at their enemy, armed with spears and small shields, but they did not wear armour.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}}\n\nWhile archaeological evidence for a large-scale migration is lacking, most present-day historians claim that Slavs invaded and settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=26\u201341}} According to this dominant narrative, up until the late 560s their main activity across the Danube was raiding, though with limited Slavic settlement mainly through Byzantine colonies of ''[[foederati]]''.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The [[Danube]] and [[Sava]] frontier was overwhelmed by large-scale Slavic settlement in the late 6th and early 7th century.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=33}} What is today [[central Serbia]] was an important geo-strategical province, through which the ''[[Via Militaris]]'' crossed.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2002|p=187}} This area was frequently intruded upon by [[Barbarians in the Byzantine Empire|barbarians]] in the 5th and 6th centuries.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2002|p=187}} From the Danube, the Slavs commenced raiding the Byzantine Empire on an annual basis from the 520s, spreading destruction, taking loot and herds of cattle, seizing prisoners and taking fortresses. Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities. Their influence in the Balkans however diminished by the early 7th century and they were finally defeated and disappeared as a power at the turn of the 9th century by [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and the [[Frankish Empire]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=29\u201343}} The first South Slavic polity and regional power was [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], a state formed in 681 as a union between the much numerous [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavic]] [[Sclaveni|tribes]] and the [[bulgars]] of [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Khan Asparuh]]. The scattered Slavs in Greece, the ''Sklavinia'', were Hellenized.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=41}} Romance-speakers lived within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Traditional historiography, based on DAI, holds that the migration of [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] to the Balkans was part of a second Slavic wave, placed during Heraclius' reign.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=66}}\n \nInhabiting the territory between the Franks in the north and Byzantium in the south, the Slavs were exposed to competing influences.{{sfn|Portal|1969|p=90}} In 863 to Christianized [[Great Moravia]] were sent two Byzantine brothers monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], Slavs from Thessaloniki on missionary work. They created the [[Glagolitic script]] and the first Slavic written language, [[Old Church Slavonic]], which they used to translate Biblical works. At the time, the West and South Slavs still spoke a similar language. The script used, [[Glagolitic]], was capable of representing all Slavic sounds, however, it was gradually replaced in Bulgaria in the 9th century, in Russia by the 11th century{{sfn|Portal|1969|pp=90\u201392}} Glagolitic survived into the 16th century in Croatia, used by Benedictines and Franciscans, but lost importance during the [[Counter-Reformation]] when Latin replaced it on the Dalmatian coast.{{sfn|Portal|1969|p=92}} Cyril and Methodius' disciples found refuge in already [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Christian Bulgaria]], where the [[Old Church Slavonic]] became the ecclesiastical language.{{sfn|Portal|1969|p=92}} [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]] was developed during the 9th century AD at the [[Preslav Literary School]] in [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Francis | last=Dvornik |title=The Slavs: Their Early History and Civilization | quote = The Psalter and the Book of Prophets were adapted or \"modernized\" with special regard to their use in Bulgarian churches, and it was in this school that glagolitic writing was replaced by the so-called Cyrillic writing, which was more akin to the Greek uncial, simplified matters considerably and is still used by the Orthodox Slavs. | year=1956 |place=Boston | publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |page=179}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/southeasterneuro0000curt |url-access=registration |quote=Cyrillic preslav. |title=Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500\u20131250|series=Cambridge Medieval Textbooks|author= Florin Curta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0521815390|pages= [https://archive.org/details/southeasterneuro0000curt/page/221 221]\u2013222}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=J-H9BTVHKRMC&pg=PR3-IA34&lpg=PR3-IA34&dq=The+Orthodox+Church+in+the+Byzantine+Empire+Cyrillic+preslav+eastern#v=onepage&q=%20preslav%20eastern&f=false|chapter= The Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire|title=Oxford History of the Christian Church|author= J.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

There are an estimated 35 million South Slavs and their descendants living worldwide. Among South Slavic ethnic groups that are also nations are the [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Slovenes]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]]. Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats are the three constituent nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Among South Slavic minorities or self-identifications are the [[Yugoslavs]] (former Yugoslavia), [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] (former Yugoslavia), [[Macedonian Muslims|Torbeshi]] (North Macedonia), [[Pomaks]] (Bulgaria, Greece) and [[Gorani people|Gorani]] (Kosovo). The Catholic [[Bunjevci]] and [[\u0160okci]], concentrated in [[Vojvodina|northern Serbia]] and eastern Croatia, are divided between Croat and local identities. There are also smaller communities of West and East Slavic peoples in northern Serbia.\n\n;Countries\nThere are seven countries in which South Slavs are the main population:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2075.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}</ref>\n*{{BUL}} (85.0% [[Bulgarians]])\n*{{SRB}} (83.3% [[Serbs]], 2.3% [[Bosniaks of Serbia|Bosniaks]], 0.8% [[Croats of Serbia|Croats]], 0.5% [[Montenegrins of Serbia|Montenegrins]], 0.3% [[Macedonians in Serbia|Macedonians]], 0.3% [[Bulgarians in Serbia|Bulgarians]])\n*{{CRO}} (90.4% [[Croats]], 4.4% [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]], 0.9% [[Bosniaks of Croatia|Bosniaks]], 0.2% [[Slovenes of Croatia|Slovenes]], 0.1% [[Montenegrins of Croatia|Montenegrins]], 0.1% [[Macedonians of Croatia|Macedonians]])\n*{{BIH}} (50.1% [[Bosniaks]], 30.8% [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]], 15.4% [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]])<ref>{{cite book|title=Sarajevo, juni 2016.

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations. Southern-Slavic populations (Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, and northern Croats) are\ngenetically distinct from their northern linguistic relatives.<ref name=\"R\u0119ba\u0142a ''et al.'' 2007\">{{cite journal | pmid = 17364156 | year = 2007 | last1 = Reba\u0142a | first1 = K | last2 = Mikulich | first2 = AI | last3 = Tsybovsky | first3 = IS | last4 = Siv\u00e1kov\u00e1 | first4 = D | last5 = Dzupinkov\u00e1 | first5 = Z | last6 = Szczerkowska-Dobosz | first6 = A | last7 = Szczerkowska | first7 = Z | title = Y-STR variation among Slavs: Evidence for the Slavic homeland in the middle Dnieper basin | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 406\u201314 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-007-0125-6 | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | doi-access = free }}</ref> A 2008 study concluded that except for some isolated communities, Europeans are somewhat genetically homogeneous, and individual population groups are often closely related to their immediate neighbours (irrespective of language or ethnicity).<ref>{{Citation |last=Novembre |first=J |last2=Johnson |first2=T |last3=Bryc |first3=K |title=Genes mirror geography within Europe |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7218 |pages=98\u2013101 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18758442 |doi=10.1038/nature07331 |pmc=2735096|bibcode = 2008Natur.456...98N |displayauthors=1 |last4=Kutalik |last5=Boyko |first5=AR |last6=Auton |first6=A |last7=Indap |first7=A |last8=King |first8=KS |last9=Bergmann |first9=S |last10=Nelson |first10=MR |last11=Stephens |first11=M |last12=Bustamante|first12=CD}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |vauthors=Lao O, Lu TT, Nothnagel M, etal |title=Correlation between genetic and geographic structure in Europe |journal=Curr.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in

The bases of the plants begin to turn yellow. If the plants are still green, the seed will not be useful, and the fiber will be underdeveloped. The fiber degrades once the plants turn brown.\n\nFlax grown for seed is allowed to mature until the seed capsules are yellow and just starting to split; it is then harvested in various ways. A [[combine harvester]] may either cut only the heads of the plants, or the whole plant. These are then dried to extract the seed. The amount of weeds in the straw affects its marketability, and this, coupled with market prices, determines whether the farmer chooses to harvest the flax straw. If the flax straw is not harvested, typically, it is burned, since the stalks are quite tough and decompose slowly (''i.e.'', not in a single season). Formed into [[windrow]]s from the harvesting process, the straw often clogs up tillage and planting equipment. Flax straw that is not of sufficient quality for fiber uses can be baled to build shelters for farm animals, or sold as biofuel, or removed from the field in the spring.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.producer.com/2008/03/the-last-straw-nine-ways-to-handle-flax-straw/ |title=The last straw: nine ways to handle flax straw |author=Michael Raine |date=27 March 2008 |journal=The Western Producer |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092042/http://www.producer.com/2008/03/the-last-straw-nine-ways-to-handle-flax-straw/ |archivedate=18 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\nTwo ways are used to harvest flax fiber, one involving mechanized equipment (combines), and a second method, more manual and targeting maximum fiber length.\n\n===Harvesting for fiber===\n\n====Mechanical====\nFlax for fiber production is usually harvested by a specialized flax harvester. Usually built on the same machine base as a combine, but instead of the cutting head it has a flax puller. The flax plant turned over and is gripped by rubber belts roughly 20\u201325&nbsp;cm (8-10\") above ground, to avoid getting grasses and weeds in the flax. The rubber belts then pull the whole plant out of the ground with the roots so the whole length of the plant fiber can be used. The plants then pass over the machine and is placed on the field crosswise to the harvesters direction of travel. The plants are left in the field for field retting.\n\nThe mature plant can also be cut with mowing equipment, similar to hay harvesting, and raked into windrows. When dried sufficiently, a combine then harvests the seeds similar to wheat or oat harvesting .\n\n====Manual====\nThe plant is pulled up with the roots (not cut), so as to increase the fiber length. After this, the flax is allowed to dry, the seeds are removed, and it is then [[Retting|retted]]. Dependent upon climatic conditions, characteristics of the sown flax and fields, the flax remains on the ground between two weeks and two months for retting. As a result of alternating rain and the sun, an enzymatic action degrades the pectins which bind fibers to the straw. The farmers turn over the straw during retting to evenly rett the stalks. When the straw is retted and sufficiently dry, it is rolled up. It is then stored by farmers before extracting the fibers.\n[[File:Emile Claus001.jpg|thumb|''De vlasoogst'' (1904) (\"''The flax harvest''\") painting by [[Emile Claus]], [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]]]\n\n==Processing==\n[[File:Drhlen.jpg|thumb|A hackle or heckle, a tool for threshing flax and preparing the fiber]]\n[[File:58-aspetti di vita quotidiana,abbigliamento lino,Taccuino Sa.jpg|thumb|Flax tissues, [[Tacuinum sanitatis]], 14th century]]\n[[Threshing]] is the process of removing the seeds from the rest of the plant. Separating the usable flax fibers from other components requires pulling the stems through a hackle and/or beating the plants to break them.\n\nFlax processing is divided into two parts: the first part is generally done by the farmer, to bring the flax fiber into a fit state for general or common purposes. This can be performed by three machines: one for threshing out the seed, one for breaking and separating the straw (stem) from the fiber, and one for further separating the broken straw and matter from the fiber.\n\nThe second part of the process brings the flax into a state for the very finest purposes, such as [[lace]], [[cambric]], [[damask]], and very fine [[linen]]. This second part is performed by a refining machine.\n\n<!-- how-to, not encyclopedic * Take the flax in small handsful in the left hand, spread it flat between the third and little finger, with the seed end downward, and the root-end above, as near the hand as possible.\n* Put the handful between the beaters of the breaking machine, and beat it gently till the three or four inches, which have been under the operation of the machine, appear to be soft.\n* Remove the flax a little higher in the hand, so as to let the soft part of the flax rest upon the little finger, and continue to beat it till all is soft, and the wood is separated from the fiber, keeping the left hand close to the block and the flax as flat upon the block as possible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n* The other end of the flax is then to be turned, and the end which has been beaten is to be wrapped round the little finger, the root end flat, and beaten in the machine till the wood is separated, exactly in the same way as the other end was beaten. -->\n\n==Preparation for spinning==\n[[File:Labeledstemforposter copy.jpg|thumb|Stem cross-section, showing locations of underlying tissues: Ep = [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]; C = [[cortex (botany)|cortex]]; BF = [[bast (biology)|bast]] fibers; P = [[phloem]]; X = [[xylem]]; Pi = [[pith]]]]\n[[File:Rhof-flachsbearbeitung.ogv|thumb|Threshing, retting, and dressing flax at the [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]] (Germany)]]\nBefore the flax fibers can be spun into linen, they must be separated from the rest of the stalk. The first step in this process is [[retting]], which is the process of rotting away the inner stalk, leaving the outer parts intact. At this point, straw, or coarse outer stem ([[cortex (botany)|cortex]] and [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]), is still remaining. To remove this, the flax is \"broken\", the straw is broken up into small, short bits, while the actual fiber is left unharmed. [[Scutching]] scrapes the outer straw from the fiber. The stems are then pulled through \"hackles\", which act like combs to remove the straw and some shorter fibers out of the long fiber.\n\n===Retting flax===\nSeveral methods are used for [[retting]] flax. It can be retted in a pond, stream, field, or tank. When the retting is complete, the bundles of flax feel soft and slimy, and quite a few fibers are standing out from the stalks. When wrapped around a finger, the inner woody part springs away from the fibers. Pond retting is the fastest. It consists of placing the flax in a pool of water which will not evaporate. It generally takes place in a shallow pool which will warm up dramatically in the sun; the process may take from a few days to a few weeks. Pond-retted flax is traditionally considered of lower quality, possibly because the product can become dirty, and is easily over-retted, damaging the fiber. This form of retting also produces quite an odor. Stream retting is similar to pool retting, but the flax is submerged in bundles in a stream or river. This generally takes two or three weeks longer than pond retting, but the end product is less likely to be dirty, does not smell as bad, and because the water is cooler, is less likely to be over-retted. Both pond and stream retting were traditionally used less because they pollute the waters used for the process.\n\nIn field retting, the flax is laid out in a large field, and dew is allowed to collect on it. This process normally takes a month or more, but is generally considered to provide the highest quality flax fibers,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and it produces the least pollution.\n\nRetting can also be done in a plastic trash can or any type of water-tight container of wood, concrete, earthenware, or plastic. Metal containers will not work, as an acid is produced when retting, and it would [[corrode]] the metal. If the water temperature is kept at {{convert|80|F|C}}, the retting process under these conditions takes 4 or 5 days. If the water is any colder, it takes longer. Scum collects at the top, and an odor is given off the same as in pond retting. 'Enzymatic' retting of flax has been researched as a technique to engineer fibers with specific properties.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Akin Dodd | first1 = Foulk | year = 2008 | title = Pectinolytic enzymes and retting | url = | journal = BioResources | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 155\u2013169 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Akin Dodd | first1 = Foulk | year = 2001 | title = Processing techniques for improving enzyme-retting of flax | url = | journal = Industrial Crops and Products | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 239\u2013248 | doi=10.1016/s0926-6690(00)00081-9}}</ref>\n\n===Dressing the flax===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Harfleur - Compagnons duellistes - teillage du lin.jpg|Breaking flax\nFile:Harfleur - Compagnons duellistes - battage du lin.jpg|Scutching flax\nFile:Harfleur - Compagnons duellistes - peignage du lin.jpg|Heckling flax\nFile:Flax fibers.JPG|Flax fiber in different forms, before and after processing \n</gallery>\nDressing the flax is the process of removing the straw from the fibers. Dressing consists of three steps: breaking, scutching, and heckling. The breaking breaks up the straw. Some of the straw is scraped from the fibers in the scutching process, and finally, the fiber is pulled through heckles to remove the last bits of straw.\n\n:Breaking breaks up the straw into short segments. <!-- more how-to To do it, take the bundles of flax and untie them. Next, in small handsful, put it between the beater of the breaking machine (a set of wooden blades that mesh together when the upper jaw is lowered, which look like a paper cutter but instead of having a big knife it has a blunt arm), and beat it till the three or four inches that have been beaten appear to be soft. Move the flax a little higher and continue to beat it till all is soft, and the wood is separated from the fiber. When half of the flax is broken, hold the beaten end and beat the rest in the same way as the other end was beaten, till the wood is separated. -->\n\n:[[Scutching]] removes some of the [[straw]] from the fiber<!-- , it helps to swing a wooden scutching knife down the fibers while they hang vertically, thus scraping the edge of the knife along the fibers and pull away pieces of the stalk. Some of the fiber will also be scutched away, this cannot be helped and is a normal part of the process -->.\n\n:[[Heckling (flax)|Heckling]] is pulling the fiber through various sizes of [[heckling comb]]s or heckles. A heckle is a bed of \"nails\"\u2014sharp, long-tapered, tempered, polished steel pins driven into wooden blocks at regular spacing. <!-- A good progression is from four pins per square inch, to 12, to 25 to 48 to 80.

Coarser grades are used for the manufacturing of [[twine]] and [[rope]], and historically, for [[canvas]] and [[webbing equipment]].

The bases of the plants begin to turn yellow. If the plants are still green, the seed will not be useful, and the fiber will be underdeveloped. The fiber degrades once the plants turn brown.\n\nFlax grown for seed is allowed to mature until the seed capsules are yellow and just starting to split; it is then harvested in various ways. A [[combine harvester]] may either cut only the heads of the plants, or the whole plant. These are then dried to extract the seed. The amount of weeds in the straw affects its marketability, and this, coupled with market prices, determines whether the farmer chooses to harvest the flax straw. If the flax straw is not harvested, typically, it is burned, since the stalks are quite tough and decompose slowly (''i.e.'', not in a single season). Formed into [[windrow]]s from the harvesting process, the straw often clogs up tillage and planting equipment. Flax straw that is not of sufficient quality for fiber uses can be baled to build shelters for farm animals, or sold as biofuel, or removed from the field in the spring.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.producer.com/2008/03/the-last-straw-nine-ways-to-handle-flax-straw/ |title=The last straw: nine ways to handle flax straw |author=Michael Raine |date=27 March 2008 |journal=The Western Producer |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092042/http://www.producer.com/2008/03/the-last-straw-nine-ways-to-handle-flax-straw/ |archivedate=18 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\nTwo ways are used to harvest flax fiber, one involving mechanized equipment (combines), and a second method, more manual and targeting maximum fiber length.\n\n===Harvesting for fiber===\n\n====Mechanical====\nFlax for fiber production is usually harvested by a specialized flax harvester. Usually built on the same machine base as a combine, but instead of the cutting head it has a flax puller. The flax plant turned over and is gripped by rubber belts roughly 20\u201325&nbsp;cm (8-10\") above ground, to avoid getting grasses and weeds in the flax. The rubber belts then pull the whole plant out of the ground with the roots so the whole length of the plant fiber can be used. The plants then pass over the machine and is placed on the field crosswise to the harvesters direction of travel. The plants are left in the field for field retting.\n\nThe mature plant can also be cut with mowing equipment, similar to hay harvesting, and raked into windrows. When dried sufficiently, a combine then harvests the seeds similar to wheat or oat harvesting .\n\n====Manual====\nThe plant is pulled up with the roots (not cut), so as to increase the fiber length. After this, the flax is allowed to dry, the seeds are removed, and it is then [[Retting|retted]]. Dependent upon climatic conditions, characteristics of the sown flax and fields, the flax remains on the ground between two weeks and two months for retting. As a result of alternating rain and the sun, an enzymatic action degrades the pectins which bind fibers to the straw. The farmers turn over the straw during retting to evenly rett the stalks. When the straw is retted and sufficiently dry, it is rolled up. It is then stored by farmers before extracting the fibers.\n[[File:Emile Claus001.jpg|thumb|''De vlasoogst'' (1904) (\"''The flax harvest''\") painting by [[Emile Claus]], [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]]]\n\n==Processing==\n[[File:Drhlen.jpg|thumb|A hackle or heckle, a tool for threshing flax and preparing the fiber]]\n[[File:58-aspetti di vita quotidiana,abbigliamento lino,Taccuino Sa.jpg|thumb|Flax tissues, [[Tacuinum sanitatis]], 14th century]]\n[[Threshing]] is the process of removing the seeds from the rest of the plant. Separating the usable flax fibers from other components requires pulling the stems through a hackle and/or beating the plants to break them.\n\nFlax processing is divided into two parts: the first part is generally done by the farmer, to bring the flax fiber into a fit state for general or common purposes. This can be performed by three machines: one for threshing out the seed, one for breaking and separating the straw (stem) from the fiber, and one for further separating the broken straw and matter from the fiber.\n\nThe second part of the process brings the flax into a state for the very finest purposes, such as [[lace]], [[cambric]], [[damask]], and very fine [[linen]]. This second part is performed by a refining machine.\n\n<!-- how-to, not encyclopedic * Take the flax in small handsful in the left hand, spread it flat between the third and little finger, with the seed end downward, and the root-end above, as near the hand as possible.\n* Put the handful between the beaters of the breaking machine, and beat it gently till the three or four inches, which have been under the operation of the machine, appear to be soft.\n* Remove the flax a little higher in the hand, so as to let the soft part of the flax rest upon the little finger, and continue to beat it till all is soft, and the wood is separated from the fiber, keeping the left hand close to the block and the flax as flat upon the block as possible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n* The other end of the flax is then to be turned, and the end which has been beaten is to be wrapped round the little finger, the root end flat, and beaten in the machine till the wood is separated, exactly in the same way as the other end was beaten. -->\n\n==Preparation for spinning==\n[[File:Labeledstemforposter copy.jpg|thumb|Stem cross-section, showing locations of underlying tissues: Ep = [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]; C = [[cortex (botany)|cortex]]; BF = [[bast (biology)|bast]] fibers; P = [[phloem]]; X = [[xylem]]; Pi = [[pith]]]]\n[[File:Rhof-flachsbearbeitung.ogv|thumb|Threshing, retting, and dressing flax at the [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]] (Germany)]]\nBefore the flax fibers can be spun into linen, they must be separated from the rest of the stalk. The first step in this process is [[retting]], which is the process of rotting away the inner stalk, leaving the outer parts intact. At this point, straw, or coarse outer stem ([[cortex (botany)|cortex]] and [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]), is still remaining. To remove this, the flax is \"broken\", the straw is broken up into small, short bits, while the actual fiber is left unharmed. [[Scutching]] scrapes the outer straw from the fiber. The stems are then pulled through \"hackles\", which act like combs to remove the straw and some shorter fibers out of the long fiber.\n\n===Retting flax===\nSeveral methods are used for [[retting]] flax. It can be retted in a pond, stream, field, or tank. When the retting is complete, the bundles of flax feel soft and slimy, and quite a few fibers are standing out from the stalks. When wrapped around a finger, the inner woody part springs away from the fibers. Pond retting is the fastest. It consists of placing the flax in a pool of water which will not evaporate. It generally takes place in a shallow pool which will warm up dramatically in the sun; the process may take from a few days to a few weeks. Pond-retted flax is traditionally considered of lower quality, possibly because the product can become dirty, and is easily over-retted, damaging the fiber. This form of retting also produces quite an odor. Stream retting is similar to pool retting, but the flax is submerged in bundles in a stream or river. This generally takes two or three weeks longer than pond retting, but the end product is less likely to be dirty, does not smell as bad, and because the water is cooler, is less likely to be over-retted. Both pond and stream retting were traditionally used less because they pollute the waters used for the process.\n\nIn field retting, the flax is laid out in a large field, and dew is allowed to collect on it. This process normally takes a month or more, but is generally considered to provide the highest quality flax fibers,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and it produces the least pollution.\n\nRetting can also be done in a plastic trash can or any type of water-tight container of wood, concrete, earthenware, or plastic. Metal containers will not work, as an acid is produced when retting, and it would [[corrode]] the metal. If the water temperature is kept at {{convert|80|F|C}}, the retting process under these conditions takes 4 or 5 days. If the water is any colder, it takes longer. Scum collects at the top, and an odor is given off the same as in pond retting. 'Enzymatic' retting of flax has been researched as a technique to engineer fibers with specific properties.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Akin Dodd | first1 = Foulk | year = 2008 | title = Pectinolytic enzymes and retting | url = | journal = BioResources | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 155\u2013169 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Akin Dodd | first1 = Foulk | year = 2001 | title = Processing techniques for improving enzyme-retting of flax | url = | journal = Industrial Crops and Products | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 239\u2013248 | doi=10.1016/s0926-6690(00)00081-9}}</ref>\n\n===Dressing the flax===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Harfleur - Compagnons duellistes - teillage du lin.jpg|Breaking flax\nFile:Harfleur - Compagnons duellistes - battage du lin.jpg|Scutching flax\nFile:Harfleur - Compagnons duellistes - peignage du lin.jpg|Heckling flax\nFile:Flax fibers.JPG|Flax fiber in different forms, before and after processing \n</gallery>\nDressing the flax is the process of removing the straw from the fibers. Dressing consists of three steps: breaking, scutching, and heckling. The breaking breaks up the straw. Some of the straw is scraped from the fibers in the scutching process, and finally, the fiber is pulled through heckles to remove the last bits of straw.\n\n:Breaking breaks up the straw into short segments. <!-- more how-to To do it, take the bundles of flax and untie them. Next, in small handsful, put it between the beater of the breaking machine (a set of wooden blades that mesh together when the upper jaw is lowered, which look like a paper cutter but instead of having a big knife it has a blunt arm), and beat it till the three or four inches that have been beaten appear to be soft. Move the flax a little higher and continue to beat it till all is soft, and the wood is separated from the fiber. When half of the flax is broken, hold the beaten end and beat the rest in the same way as the other end was beaten, till the wood is separated. -->\n\n:[[Scutching]] removes some of the [[straw]] from the fiber<!-- , it helps to swing a wooden scutching knife down the fibers while they hang vertically, thus scraping the edge of the knife along the fibers and pull away pieces of the stalk. Some of the fiber will also be scutched away, this cannot be helped and is a normal part of the process -->.\n\n:[[Heckling (flax)|Heckling]] is pulling the fiber through various sizes of [[heckling comb]]s or heckles. A heckle is a bed of \"nails\"\u2014sharp, long-tapered, tempered, polished steel pins driven into wooden blocks at regular spacing. <!-- A good progression is from four pins per square inch, to 12, to 25 to 48 to 80.

The managerialist society responds to the managements of various organizations in relation to their transactions with each other. The needs, desires and wishes of the individual are heard through their membership of an organization. Furthermore, managerialism is both a process and a substantive ideology. Managerialism says that the fundamental social units are not individuals, as [[capitalism]] would declare, but rather that the fundamental social units are organizations. Ultimately, managerialism specifically denies that the fundamental nature of society is an aggregation of individuals.<ref>{{cite book|last= Enteman|first= Willard F.|title= Managerialism : the emergence of a new ideology.|url= https://archive.org/details/managerialismeme0000ente|url-access= registration|year= 1993|publisher= University of Wisconsin Press|location= Madison, Wi|isbn= 0299139247}}</ref>{{qn|date=January 2017}}\n\nInstead, managerialism sees the core building-block of contemporary society as the modern [[business sector|business]] company or corporation. To further [[commerce|business]], companies, and corporations is the ideological goal of managerialism. How managerialism functions as such an ideology has been perfectly expressed by one of managerialism's main ideological flagships \u2013 the ''Harvard Business Review'' - when the ''HBR'''s former editor Joan Magretta (2012: 80-81) made the following stunning revelation:[[# edn1|[i]]]<blockquote> Business executives are society's leading champions of free markets and competition, words that, for them, evoke a world view and value system that rewards good ideas and hard work, and that fosters innovation and meritocracy. Truth be told, the competition every manager longs for is a lot closer to Microsoft's end of the spectrum than it is to the dairy farmers'. All the talk about the virtues of competition notwithstanding, the aim of business strategy is to move an enterprise away from perfect competition and in the direction of monopoly.\n----[[# ednref1|[i]]]            Magretta, J. 2012. ''What Management Is: How it works and why it's everyone's business'', London: Profile.</blockquote>\n\n=== Political ===\nManagerialism in [[political science]] is a set of beliefs, attitudes and values which support the view that management is the most essential and desirable element of good administration and government. It follows that in all enterprises and services, both private and public, expertise in management must be taught by training and by incentives to excel. In the political world this may take the form of asserting that much conflict and argument are unnecessary for solving problems. All that is needed is a rational assessment of the problem and this involves gathering and collating information, listing the options, calculating costs of each, evaluating consequences and choosing the best course of action. Recent managerialism has included such devices as \"[[performance indicator]]s\" (purporting to measure the relative efficiencies of different managers) and \"[[market testing]]\" (which compares public sector managers' responsibilities and tasks with those of managers in the private sector in order to assess their pay). Managerialism is criticized for weakening the [[public service|public-service]] ethos.<ref>{{cite book|last= Enteman|first= Willard F.|title= Managerialism : the emergence of a new ideology.|url= https://archive.org/details/managerialismeme0000ente|url-access= registration|year= 1993|publisher= University of Wisconsin Press|location= Madison, Wi|isbn= 0299139247}}</ref>\n\nIf one were to conceive of society as a nation, such as the United States, managerialism concludes that there is no single United States and that individual Americans should not be identified as the fundamental nature of the country. Rather, the country is basically composed of numerous groups which collectively make up the country we call the United States. \nThe government is a part of the managerial process. The management of different groups will attempt to influence the direction of government action. Their success or failure will depend upon their ability to pursue their case and upon their ability to blunt the cases of competitors. The success of the subunits depends upon the ability of their managements and other factors such as size, cohesiveness, managerial discretion, and control of resources. Government itself is a collection of governmental units. The government is not state.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bealey|first= Frank|title= The Blackwell dictionary of political science|year= 1999|publisher= Blackwell Publishers|location= Oxford, UK|isbn= 9780631206958|edition= 1. publ.}}</ref>\n\n=== Economic ===\nEconomically, managerialism is the application of [http://smallbusiness.chron.com/management-techniques-2589.html managerial techniques] in businesses. Managerialism in this regard has to do with the strategic approach of [[goal-setting]]. In order to achieve previously unimagined levels of accumulation and production, businesses within a capitalist economy needed a way of connecting their strategic plan of actions to desired implementations of those plans. Within an organization, the individuals at the top of the organizational hierarchy determine a mission or set of goals, which is then strategically analyzed by individuals lower on the hierarchy (managers) to devise local goals to carry out the overall mission. Put simply, the managerial standard is to receive goals from above and to create new goals for those below.<ref>{{cite web|last= Preston|first= David Seth|title= The Rise of Managerialism|url= http://www.ffst.hr/ENCYCLOPAEDIA/doku.php?id=the_rise_of_managerialism|work= Encyclopaedia of Philosophy of Education|accessdate= 5 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nThere is a belief that in managerialism, organizations have more similarities than differences, and thus the performance of all organizations can be optimized by the application of generic management skills and theory.

Web. 25 Apr. 2016.</ref>\n\nThere have been mixed reviews on the efficacy of managerialism, explored extensively in university studies of the State. Some have accepted the flaws in the theory, building upon it and putting it forth as a valid theory of the State. Others have outright rejected such a proposition, responding that - regardless of the few similarities - such a system could not be successful on a political level.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe word \"managerialism\" can also be used pejoratively, as in the definition of a management caste. Robert R. Locke defines it accordingly as:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"What occurs when a special group, called management, ensconces itself systemically in an organization and deprives owners and employees of their decision-making power (including the distribution of emolument), and justifies that takeover on the grounds of the managing group's education and exclusive possession of the codified bodies of knowledge and know-how necessary to the efficient running of the organization.\"<ref>\n{{cite web \n|title= Managerialism and the Demise of the Big Three, Real-World Economics Review \n|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue51/Locke51.pdf \n|accessdate= 2011-09-26\n}}\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n== New Managerialism ==\nManagerialism  \u2013 also called New Managerialism and New Public Management \u2013 is an [[ideology]] used for legitimizing the development of new organizational forms and relationships. It has been coined a practical ideology of being 'business-like\u2019 in order to make the new arrangements work for all forms of jobs, organizations, and education systems. The \u2018business-like\u2019 indicates what is called \u201cas if\u201d ideologies. Managerialism is conceptualized in that it seeks firstly to explain the [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] and political reasons behind why particular organizations  have been developed and, secondly, to describe the ways in which public services are currently being delivered. The idea of Managerialism came to fruition when  new organizational forms originated from a view that professional [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] modes of organization were inefficient and could not cope with the challenges rising from increasing globalization. Managerialism, however, has not remained static over the years as it has had many different versions of its implementation. Its linkage to the changing practices associated with an agenda moves away from a purely [[Neoliberalism|Neo-liberal]] framework. While neo-liberalism uses politics (e.g. elections) to achieve its goals, Managerialism is fundamentally anti-democratic following instead management\u2019s [[Henri Fayol|command-and-control]] concept. While using business-like mechanisms to ensure great cost effectiveness is still used as a great technique. There have been movements away from purely market based systems that were in place strictly for efficiency, to contractual mechanisms and performance measurement through audit and review. In practice of Managerialism, consumers are redefined as well. Not only do consumers have choice in regard to where and how they receive their services, but they should be actively involved in determining what services should be provided as  well.<ref>Nickson, Alicen. 2014. \"A Qualitative Case Study Exploring the Nature of New Managerialism in UK Higher Education and Its Impact on Individual Academics' Experience of Doing Research.\" Journal of Research Administration 45, no. 1: 47-80. Business Source Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed March 8, 2016).</ref> In new Managerialism consumers are redefined as well. Not only should they have choice regarding where and how they receive their services, but they should be actively involved in determining what services should be provided as  well. The Managerialism explains public services not as production functions or firms, but as governance structures. What is at stake is not so much the ethos and practice of management as the culture and structure of governance. Here governance means the organisational culture and structure of the relationship between what [[Max Weber|Weber]] called legitimate domination and the self-constitution of those who are subject to it. What Weber meant by legitimate domination was justified by an authority structure, which was, in turn, legitimated by rational authority. Hence, one finds a renewed interest of Managerialism in fostering managerial leadership. But governance through Managerialism was never only dependent for its legitimization on Weber\u2019s notion of [[legal-rational authority]], but more on forms of rationality that depend upon, for example, strategic management, cost-benefit-analysis, efficiency in the market, etc. Although this Managerialism draws on models of corporate Managerialism as well as accounts of New Public Management, it is also imbued with the practices of self in everyday life.

A former professor of [[Industrial Management]] at the Harvard Business School, Mayo heavily researched the behavior of workers at Western Electric; a manufacturing facet of AT&T. Today he is considered a major contributor to the intellectual thought process and ideas of business management, as well as critical theories of industrial and organizational psychology.  His book, ''The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization''  articulates his collective thoughts taken from the famous Hawthorne research study conducted while at Harvard University.\n\n'''Karl Marx'''\n\n''\"Society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand.\"''<ref>Marx, Karl, and David McLellan. ''The Grundrisse''. Print.</ref>\n\n[[Karl Marx]] has set many standards in the fields of philosophy, economics, and sociology as one of the worlds most prominent thinkers. Commonly known for his ideas outlined in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' and ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]]'' Marx has exemplified ideas of management and order with his very apparent [[Socialism|socialistic views]].  Sociologically Marx has identified core interrelations between groups of people classified by class structures, and how those relations lead to the success or failures of a collective society.\n\n'''Friedrich Nietzsche''' \n''\"To do great things is difficult; but to command great things is more difficult\"''<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, and Walter Arnold. Kaufmann. ''The Portable Nietzsche''. New York: Penguin, 1976.

Focussing in on ideas of morality; particularly distinguishing the differences between what he labeled the, \"master morality,\" and \"slave morality,\" Nietzsche has exemplified the development of managerial practices through the subjections of moral emphasis and control. \"He was especially interested, therefore, in a probing analysis and evaluation of the fundamental cultural values of Western philosophy, religion, and morality, which he characterized as expressions of the ascetic ideal.\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Friedrich-Nietzsche\n\n== History ==  \nThe history of Managerialism is linked to the teachings of [[Karl Marx]]. In his collection of books over capitalism appropriately named [[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]] he writes about how when capitalist merge with other capitalist and two corporations come together, they are more likely to become diluted and when that happens those who were once wise business leaders were to be just aimless managers he stated his belief in his books (only volume 1 was published while he was alive) as follows, \"Transformation of the actually functioning capitalist into a mere manager, an administrator of other people's capital, and of the owners of capital into mere owners, mere money-capitalists.\".<ref>Jessop, Bob, and Russell Wheatley. ''Karl Marx's Social and Political Thought''. London: Routledge, 1999. Print.</ref> Marx is talking about what would later be known as Managerialism which is first used by [[James Burnham]] who in his book ''The Managerial Revolution'' expresses his ideas on the difference between Capitalism and Managerialism stating that when the owners of capital are no longer the ones in charge, and managers, relying on only principle are in charge then it is no longer [[Capitalism]], it is now considered Managerialism.  Burnham's ideas, in both that book and a subsequent book ''The Machiavellians'' and also in articles which were published in Partisan Review, and elsewhere are thoroughly criticised by [[George Orwell]] in his 1946 essay ''Second Thoughts on James Burnham'' (first published in ''Polemic'' (London).\n\nCompare:\n* [[New Public Management]]\n* [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Managerial state]]\n*[[Corporatocracy]]\n*[[Corporatism]]\n* [[James Burnham]], author of ''The Managerial Revolution'' (1941)\n* [[George Orwell]], author of ''Second Thoughts on James Burnham (1946)\n* [[Performance measurement]]\n* [[Scientific management]]\n* [[Management]]\n\n==References==\n<references />.\n\n[[Category:Public administration]]\n[[Category:Management]]\n[[Category:Political philosophy]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:K11679965.jpg|thumb]]\n'''Managerialism''', on one level, involves [[belief]] in the value of [[professional]] [[manager]]s and of the concepts and methods they use.

The managerialist society responds to the managements of various organizations in relation to their transactions with each other. The needs, desires and wishes of the individual are heard through their membership of an organization. Furthermore, managerialism is both a process and a substantive ideology. Managerialism says that the fundamental social units are not individuals, as [[capitalism]] would declare, but rather that the fundamental social units are organizations. Ultimately, managerialism specifically denies that the fundamental nature of society is an aggregation of individuals.<ref>{{cite book|last= Enteman|first= Willard F.|title= Managerialism : the emergence of a new ideology.|url= https://archive.org/details/managerialismeme0000ente|url-access= registration|year= 1993|publisher= University of Wisconsin Press|location= Madison, Wi|isbn= 0299139247}}</ref>{{qn|date=January 2017}}\n\nInstead, managerialism sees the core building-block of contemporary society as the modern [[business sector|business]] company or corporation. To further [[commerce|business]], companies, and corporations is the ideological goal of managerialism. How managerialism functions as such an ideology has been perfectly expressed by one of managerialism's main ideological flagships \u2013 the ''Harvard Business Review'' - when the ''HBR'''s former editor Joan Magretta (2012: 80-81) made the following stunning revelation:[[# edn1|[i]]]<blockquote> Business executives are society's leading champions of free markets and competition, words that, for them, evoke a world view and value system that rewards good ideas and hard work, and that fosters innovation and meritocracy. Truth be told, the competition every manager longs for is a lot closer to Microsoft's end of the spectrum than it is to the dairy farmers'. All the talk about the virtues of competition notwithstanding, the aim of business strategy is to move an enterprise away from perfect competition and in the direction of monopoly.\n----[[# ednref1|[i]]]            Magretta, J. 2012. ''What Management Is: How it works and why it's everyone's business'', London: Profile.</blockquote>\n\n=== Political ===\nManagerialism in [[political science]] is a set of beliefs, attitudes and values which support the view that management is the most essential and desirable element of good administration and government. It follows that in all enterprises and services, both private and public, expertise in management must be taught by training and by incentives to excel. In the political world this may take the form of asserting that much conflict and argument are unnecessary for solving problems. All that is needed is a rational assessment of the problem and this involves gathering and collating information, listing the options, calculating costs of each, evaluating consequences and choosing the best course of action. Recent managerialism has included such devices as \"[[performance indicator]]s\" (purporting to measure the relative efficiencies of different managers) and \"[[market testing]]\" (which compares public sector managers' responsibilities and tasks with those of managers in the private sector in order to assess their pay). Managerialism is criticized for weakening the [[public service|public-service]] ethos.<ref>{{cite book|last= Enteman|first= Willard F.|title= Managerialism : the emergence of a new ideology.|url= https://archive.org/details/managerialismeme0000ente|url-access= registration|year= 1993|publisher= University of Wisconsin Press|location= Madison, Wi|isbn= 0299139247}}</ref>\n\nIf one were to conceive of society as a nation, such as the United States, managerialism concludes that there is no single United States and that individual Americans should not be identified as the fundamental nature of the country. Rather, the country is basically composed of numerous groups which collectively make up the country we call the United States. \nThe government is a part of the managerial process. The management of different groups will attempt to influence the direction of government action. Their success or failure will depend upon their ability to pursue their case and upon their ability to blunt the cases of competitors. The success of the subunits depends upon the ability of their managements and other factors such as size, cohesiveness, managerial discretion, and control of resources. Government itself is a collection of governmental units. The government is not state.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bealey|first= Frank|title= The Blackwell dictionary of political science|year= 1999|publisher= Blackwell Publishers|location= Oxford, UK|isbn= 9780631206958|edition= 1. publ.}}</ref>\n\n=== Economic ===\nEconomically, managerialism is the application of [http://smallbusiness.chron.com/management-techniques-2589.html managerial techniques] in businesses. Managerialism in this regard has to do with the strategic approach of [[goal-setting]]. In order to achieve previously unimagined levels of accumulation and production, businesses within a capitalist economy needed a way of connecting their strategic plan of actions to desired implementations of those plans. Within an organization, the individuals at the top of the organizational hierarchy determine a mission or set of goals, which is then strategically analyzed by individuals lower on the hierarchy (managers) to devise local goals to carry out the overall mission. Put simply, the managerial standard is to receive goals from above and to create new goals for those below.<ref>{{cite web|last= Preston|first= David Seth|title= The Rise of Managerialism|url= http://www.ffst.hr/ENCYCLOPAEDIA/doku.php?id=the_rise_of_managerialism|work= Encyclopaedia of Philosophy of Education|accessdate= 5 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nThere is a belief that in managerialism, organizations have more similarities than differences, and thus the performance of all organizations can be optimized by the application of generic management skills and theory.

Some have accepted the flaws in the theory, building upon it and putting it forth as a valid theory of the State. Others have outright rejected such a proposition, responding that - regardless of the few similarities - such a system could not be successful on a political level.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe word \"managerialism\" can also be used pejoratively, as in the definition of a management caste. Robert R. Locke defines it accordingly as:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"What occurs when a special group, called management, ensconces itself systemically in an organization and deprives owners and employees of their decision-making power (including the distribution of emolument), and justifies that takeover on the grounds of the managing group's education and exclusive possession of the codified bodies of knowledge and know-how necessary to the efficient running of the organization.\"<ref>\n{{cite web \n|title= Managerialism and the Demise of the Big Three, Real-World Economics Review \n|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue51/Locke51.pdf \n|accessdate= 2011-09-26\n}}\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n== New Managerialism ==\nManagerialism  \u2013 also called New Managerialism and New Public Management \u2013 is an [[ideology]] used for legitimizing the development of new organizational forms and relationships. It has been coined a practical ideology of being 'business-like\u2019 in order to make the new arrangements work for all forms of jobs, organizations, and education systems. The \u2018business-like\u2019 indicates what is called \u201cas if\u201d ideologies. Managerialism is conceptualized in that it seeks firstly to explain the [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] and political reasons behind why particular organizations  have been developed and, secondly, to describe the ways in which public services are currently being delivered. The idea of Managerialism came to fruition when  new organizational forms originated from a view that professional [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] modes of organization were inefficient and could not cope with the challenges rising from increasing globalization. Managerialism, however, has not remained static over the years as it has had many different versions of its implementation. Its linkage to the changing practices associated with an agenda moves away from a purely [[Neoliberalism|Neo-liberal]] framework. While neo-liberalism uses politics (e.g. elections) to achieve its goals, Managerialism is fundamentally anti-democratic following instead management\u2019s [[Henri Fayol|command-and-control]] concept. While using business-like mechanisms to ensure great cost effectiveness is still used as a great technique. There have been movements away from purely market based systems that were in place strictly for efficiency, to contractual mechanisms and performance measurement through audit and review. In practice of Managerialism, consumers are redefined as well. Not only do consumers have choice in regard to where and how they receive their services, but they should be actively involved in determining what services should be provided as  well.<ref>Nickson, Alicen. 2014. \"A Qualitative Case Study Exploring the Nature of New Managerialism in UK Higher Education and Its Impact on Individual Academics' Experience of Doing Research.\" Journal of Research Administration 45, no. 1: 47-80. Business Source Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed March 8, 2016).</ref> In new Managerialism consumers are redefined as well. Not only should they have choice regarding where and how they receive their services, but they should be actively involved in determining what services should be provided as  well. The Managerialism explains public services not as production functions or firms, but as governance structures. What is at stake is not so much the ethos and practice of management as the culture and structure of governance. Here governance means the organisational culture and structure of the relationship between what [[Max Weber|Weber]] called legitimate domination and the self-constitution of those who are subject to it. What Weber meant by legitimate domination was justified by an authority structure, which was, in turn, legitimated by rational authority. Hence, one finds a renewed interest of Managerialism in fostering managerial leadership. But governance through Managerialism was never only dependent for its legitimization on Weber\u2019s notion of [[legal-rational authority]], but more on forms of rationality that depend upon, for example, strategic management, cost-benefit-analysis, efficiency in the market, etc. Although this Managerialism draws on models of corporate Managerialism as well as accounts of New Public Management, it is also imbued with the practices of self in everyday life. What is new here, is recognition of the technologies of self that individuals employ to implicate themselves in their own governance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=managerialism_and_education|title=Managerialism and Education|last=Fitzsimons|first=Patrick|date=01/07/1999|website=EEPAT|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Educational Philosophy and Theory|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> This creates what became known as \u201cThe Entrepreneurial Self\u201d.

A former professor of [[Industrial Management]] at the Harvard Business School, Mayo heavily researched the behavior of workers at Western Electric; a manufacturing facet of AT&T. Today he is considered a major contributor to the intellectual thought process and ideas of business management, as well as critical theories of industrial and organizational psychology.  His book, ''The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization''  articulates his collective thoughts taken from the famous Hawthorne research study conducted while at Harvard University.\n\n'''Karl Marx'''\n\n''\"Society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand.\"''<ref>Marx, Karl, and David McLellan. ''The Grundrisse''. Print.</ref>\n\n[[Karl Marx]] has set many standards in the fields of philosophy, economics, and sociology as one of the worlds most prominent thinkers. Commonly known for his ideas outlined in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' and ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]]'' Marx has exemplified ideas of management and order with his very apparent [[Socialism|socialistic views]].  Sociologically Marx has identified core interrelations between groups of people classified by class structures, and how those relations lead to the success or failures of a collective society.\n\n'''Friedrich Nietzsche''' \n''\"To do great things is difficult; but to command great things is more difficult\"''<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, and Walter Arnold. Kaufmann. ''The Portable Nietzsche''. New York: Penguin, 1976. Print.</ref>\n\nA 19th century German philosopher, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] heavily contributed to the fields of management and leadership.  Focussing in on ideas of morality; particularly distinguishing the differences between what he labeled the, \"master morality,\" and \"slave morality,\" Nietzsche has exemplified the development of managerial practices through the subjections of moral emphasis and control. \"He was especially interested, therefore, in a probing analysis and evaluation of the fundamental cultural values of Western philosophy, religion, and morality, which he characterized as expressions of the ascetic ideal.\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Friedrich-Nietzsche\n\n== History ==  \nThe history of Managerialism is linked to the teachings of [[Karl Marx]]. In his collection of books over capitalism appropriately named [[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]] he writes about how when capitalist merge with other capitalist and two corporations come together, they are more likely to become diluted and when that happens those who were once wise business leaders were to be just aimless managers he stated his belief in his books (only volume 1 was published while he was alive) as follows, \"Transformation of the actually functioning capitalist into a mere manager, an administrator of other people's capital, and of the owners of capital into mere owners, mere money-capitalists.\".<ref>Jessop, Bob, and Russell Wheatley. ''Karl Marx's Social and Political Thought''. London: Routledge, 1999. Print.</ref> Marx is talking about what would later be known as Managerialism which is first used by [[James Burnham]] who in his book ''The Managerial Revolution'' expresses his ideas on the difference between Capitalism and Managerialism stating that when the owners of capital are no longer the ones in charge, and managers, relying on only principle are in charge then it is no longer [[Capitalism]], it is now considered Managerialism.  Burnham's ideas, in both that book and a subsequent book ''The Machiavellians'' and also in articles which were published in Partisan Review, and elsewhere are thoroughly criticised by [[George Orwell]] in his 1946 essay ''Second Thoughts on James Burnham'' (first published in ''Polemic'' (London).\n\nCompare:\n* [[New Public Management]]\n* [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Corporatism]]\n* [[James Burnham]], author of ''The Managerial Revolution'' (1941)\n* [[George Orwell]], author of ''Second Thoughts on James Burnham (1946)\n* [[Performance measurement]]\n* [[Scientific management]]\n* [[Management]]\n\n==References==\n<references />.\n\n[[Category:Public administration]]\n[[Category:Management]]\n[[Category:Political philosophy]]\n", "name_user": "Kanclerz K-Tech", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managerialism"}

The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #344 (Feb 1991).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=78}}</ref> Carnage was created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Mark Bagley]], however the first published artwork of Carnage was penciled by [[Chris Marrinan]]. The character belongs to a race of amorphous [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Parasitism|parasites]] known as the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiotes]]. The Carnage symbiote is usually depicted as an offspring of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].  The symbiote has taken many hosts. The original and most notable host is serial killer '''[[Cletus Kasady]]'''. Other hosts include [[Karl Malus]] and [[Norman Osborn]].[Fun Fact] Stan Lee took lots of inspiration from Joker and wanted people to stay away from Joker\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe Carnage symbiote was derived by writer [[David Michelinie]] while [[Mark Bagley]] designed the Carnage symbiote. The symbiote was designed to be a darker version of Venom and was created due to the writers not wanting a replacement for [[Eddie Brock]] as Venom. Carnage was in part created due to Venom's immense popularity with fans. The character was originally meant to be named \"Chaos\"<ref>''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' Spider-Man Special, pg. 45</ref> and then \"Ravage\" before being settled on \"Carnage\".\n\n== Hosts ==\n=== Cletus Kasady ===\n{{Main|Cletus Kasady}}\nWhen [[Eddie Brock]]'s [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] soon returned to be bonded again, allowing Venom to escape prison, the symbiote left its offspring in the cell; due to its alien mindset, the symbiote felt no emotional attachment to its offspring, regarding it as insignificant, and thus never communicated its existence to Brock via their telepathic link. The new symbiote then bonded with Brock's cellmate [[Cletus Kasady]] through a cut on his hand, transforming him into Carnage.<ref name=\"ASM 344-345\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344\u2013345</ref> The bond between the Carnage symbiote and Kasady was stronger than the bond between Brock and the Venom symbiote. Cletus Kasady was also a serial killer and thought of as insane. As a result, Carnage is far more violent, powerful, and deadly than Venom.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Kasady and the symbiote would then be a main antagonist in \"[[Maximum Carnage]]\" and Kasady would continually be the most recurring character to use the Carnage symbiote in many publications.<ref name=\"Venom #1-4\">Venom #1-4</ref>\n<ref name=\"CarnageFF\">''Carnage'' #1\u20135</ref>\n\n=== Spider-Carnage (Ben Reilly) ===\n{{Main|Ben Reilly}}\nIt eventually transferred itself to Spider-Man\u2014[[Ben Reilly]] at the time\u2014when Ben bonded with it in order to prevent it from hurting any innocent people, creating Spider-Carnage. Ben's willpower held out against the symbiote's murderous desires long enough for him to return it to Ravencroft. Reilly subsequently attempted to destroy the symbiote by subjecting himself to a potentially lethal blast of microwaves, but it escaped back to Kasady after the microwaves forced it to separate from him.<ref name=\"Spider-Carnage\">''Sensational Spider-Man'' No. 3, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 410, ''Spider-Man'' No. 67, and ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' No. 233</ref>\n\n=== Superior Carnage (Karl Malus) ===\n{{Main|Karl Malus}}\nAfter Kasady was lobotomized, he was broken out of prison by the [[Wizard (comics)|Wizard]] and [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], who intend to recruit him into the Frightful Four and turn him into their own version of Venom. After a failed attempt to control Kasady, Wizard transfers the Symbiote to Dr. [[Karl Malus]]. Dr. Malus was enraged and under the influences of the Symbiote tried to kill his teammates, but he was subdued by Klaw and controlled by Wizard, who renames him \"Superior Carnage\" and equips him with weapons.<ref name=\"SupCar\">''Superior Carnage'' #1\u20135</ref>\n\nThe trio are confronted by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] and during their battle the Wizard loses his control over Carnage and he is fatally injured once Spider-Man accidentally drops him due to the shock of finding out Wizard read his mind and knows about Otto Octvaius. Carnage, now free, goes on a rampage and starts to kill anyone in front of him. Klaw tries to stop him, but due to his weapon being damaged he fails and realizes that the only way is for the Wizard to take back control. Both Carnage and Klaw make their way outside. Carnage fights the Superior Spider-Man and admits that although he liked using weapons, for him ripping and slashing the bodies is better. Klaw tries to get the Wizard to control Carnage again, but is killed by Carnage and the explosion separates the Symbiote from its host, only to bond with the injured Wizard.<ref name=\"SupCar\" />\n\n=== Red Goblin (Norman Osborn) ===\n{{Main|Norman Osborn}}\nFollowing the events of ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'', the Carnage symbiote was stolen from an old S.H.I.E.L.D. storehouse by the then-powerless [[Norman Osborn]].<ref name=\"ASM 794\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 794</ref> He initially found himself overwhelmed by the symbiote's desire for mindless slaughter when he allowed it to merge with him,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 795</ref> but he has been able to 'persuade' the symbiote to let him take control of Carnage's powers to show it something other than 'boring' mindless slaughter.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 796</ref> Using this combination of powers during the \"[[Go Down Swinging (comic book)|Go Down Swinging]]\" storyline, Norman is easily able to tear through [[Human Torch]], [[Clash (comics)|Clash]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]], [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], and [[Anti-Venom (Marvel Comics)|Agent Anti-Venom]], with the combination of the symbiote and the Goblin serum rendering Carnage immune to its traditional weaknesses, eventually transferring part of the symbiote to his grandson Normie enough to turn him into a miniature version of Red Goblin.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 799</ref> The Carnage symbiote is seemingly destroyed by Spider-Man when he hits it with an exploding gas tank, however, because the symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe's mind. Later as Spider-Man visits Norman in Ravencroft, it's revealed that Norman's mind appears to have been completely fried and now believes that Spider-Man is actually Norman Osborn and he is Cletus Kasady. It's not clear whether or not he's faking it or if he had actually lost his mind. Meanwhile, Harry manages to remove the Carnage symbiote from Normie. Not all of it has gone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 800</ref>\n\n=== Eddie Brock ===\n{{Main|Eddie Brock}}\nFollowing the defeat of Cletus Kassady, Carnage and the gestalt symbiotes were absorbed by Eddie Brock who later is given an offer to join the Avengers, but in the middle of his big day Carnage is able to overcome Venom and takes over. Eddie leaves before things get out of hand leaving the Avengers with strange reactions. Eddie gets back home and tries to quiet the Carnage in a way he has done before with Venom, heavy medication. Eddie passes out and has a vision of Knull. This causes Eddie to take off and head towards the island where he long ago had thought he had kill Spider-Man and where he remained until the emergence of Carnage. But Carnage catches on to Eddie's thoughts and causes the plane to crash land. Separated from the Carnage symbiote, Eddie is ready to face it off.<ref>''Venom'' #21</ref>\n\n=== Other hosts ===\nThere have been other, shorter term hosts for the symbiote.\n\n==== John Jameson ====\n{{Main|John Jameson (comics)}}\nThough bonded to Kasady's bloodstream the symbiote found a way to ditch its host by travelling through the Ravencroft Institute's water pipes overwhelming Ravencroft's chief, John Jameson. Carnage used him to commit further murders before eventually bonding with Spider-man, who was Ben Reilly at the time.<ref name=\"Spider-Carnage\" />\n\n==== Carnage Cosmic (Norrin Radd) ====\n{{Main|Silver Surfer}}\nDuring a subsequent rampage, the Carnage symbiote briefly attempted to take control of the [[Silver Surfer]], who was visiting Earth at the time to welcome the [[Fantastic Four]] after their return to life following the battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. As it turned out, [[Galactus]] had consumed a planet that many Symbiotes lived on, and the species had made it a race memory so that each future Symbiote could remember it, as well as the Surfer who had been Galactus's herald at the time. Upon seeing the Silver Surfer, the Carnage Symbiote abandoned Kasady and bonded with the Silver Surfer, becoming the Carnage Cosmic. Spider-Man and the Surfer managed to return the Symbiote to Kasady, who was dying from stomach cancer, and then the Silver Surfer proceeded to seal both host and Symbiote in an unbreakable prison in an attempt to force him to reflect on his sins for eternity.<ref name=\"ASM 430-431\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430\u2013431</ref>\n\n==== Scorn (Tanis Nevies) ====\n{{Main|Scorn (Marvel Comics)}}\nAfter Carnage was ripped in half by the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] outside the Earth atmosphere<ref name=\"The Avengers 1-2\">''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #1\u20132</ref> it is later discovered that, although the host was presumably killed, the symbiote survived by becoming dormant and returned to Earth, where it was discovered by Michael Hall, a competitor of [[Tony Stark]]. He brought [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] and her doctor, Tanis Nevies, so he could use Shriek to keep the symbiote alive in order of using the properties of the symbiote, to create prosthetic limbs and exo-suits which respond in the same ways as a symbiote. One such person, Dr. Tanis Nieves, is outfitted with one of these prosthetic arms after she is caught in an attack by the [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]], who tried to rescue Shriek.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\">''Carnage'' #1\u20135</ref> When near the symbiote, her arm goes wild and forces her to kill several scientists before the symbiote forcefully bonds to her, becoming the new Carnage.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\" /> After the symbiote uses Tanis to break into a Hall Corporation facility, it is revealed that Kasady is alive (although both of his legs have been severed), his body preserved by the symbiote and repaired by Hall's prosthetics.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\" /> Kasady reclaims the symbiote and becomes Carnage once more, attempting to avenge his captivity while Spider-Man and Iron Man struggle to stop him. It is then revealed that Carnage was once again pregnant, and the suit's spawn briefly bonds to Tanis, but she removes it from herself and the symbiote bonds to Shriek before being torn from her. Scared of Shriek's malice, the symbiote arm then rebonds to Tanis, creating a new hero, Scorn, who defeats Shriek and forces her to use her sonic shriek to weaken Carnage, but he escapes.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\" />\n\n==== Wizard (Bentley Wittman) ====\nUltimately, Spider-Man brings out Kasady's body to successfully draw the symbiote into it, which immediately devours Dr. Malus and then prepares to finish off the Wizard. However, Klaw ephemeral spirit focuses his sound manipulation powers one last time for a split second to create a powerful sonic blast that disables Carnage, allowing the symbiote to be recaptured. In the epilogue it is shown that the symbiote has managed to repair the Wizard's and Kasady's brain damage.<ref name=\"SupCar\" />\n\n==== Carla Unger ====\nAfter the symbiote had died in captivity, a sample of the symbiote was being examined by Dr. Carla Unger, until the sample entered into her body. When she went home, the symbiote formed around her and then she with the symbiote killed her abusive husband. After that, the symbiote consumed her and went to other hosts to get back to Kasady. When the symbiote arrived to an injured Kasady, a scientist, who wanted the symbiote for himself tried to kill Kasady, but the symbiote rebonded to Cletus.<ref>''Superior Carnage Annual'' No. 1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==== Goblin Childe (Normie Osborn) ====\n{{Main|Normie Osborn}}\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\n{{Main|Symbiote (comics)#Biology}}\nAs Eddie Brock explained,<ref name=\"ASM 362\">The Amazing Spider-Man No. 362</ref> the Carnage symbiote was born with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor\u2014due to the fact that it gestated in an environment alien to it\u2014[[Earth]]. The alien symbiote endows Kasady with physical strength greater than that of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] combined<ref name=\"ASM 362\" /> and shape-shifting abilities, allows him to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables him to plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote [[tendril]].<ref name=\"Carnage: Mind Bomb\">''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' one-shot</ref> Much like Spider-Man, Kasady has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has a version of Spider-Man's spider-sense, as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to \"see\" in any direction, warning him of incoming threats.<ref name=\"ASM 361\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #361</ref><ref name=\"SMU 2\">''Spider-Man Unlimited #2''</ref> He can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick surfaces. The Carnage symbiote has abilities similar to those of Spider-Man as a direct result of the Venom symbiote's first host, Peter Parker, who transferred some of Spider-Man's power into the symbiote.\n\nHe is able to regenerate damaged body tissues much faster and more extensively than that of an ordinary human. This has been shown as powerful enough to allow him to regenerate from losing any part of body, from head to feet.<ref name=\"Venom Vol 2 #27\">''Venom Vol 2 #27''</ref><ref name=\"AXIS: Carnage #3\">''AXIS:Carnage #3''</ref> However, after being torn in half by the Sentry, he was fitted with artificial legs, but this occurred while he was separated from the symbiote.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\" /> Kasady is also immune to the effects of all Earthly diseases and infections as long as he remains bonded with the symbiote. Like Venom, the symbiote is vulnerable to sound (to a much smaller degree than Venom) and heat (to a much larger degree than Venom),<ref name=\"Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004\">''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man'', 2004</ref> and is undetectable to Spider-Man's spider-sense. Unlike Venom, Carnage can launch parts of his symbiote at enemies in the form of solid weapons such as darts, spears, knives, axes, etc., although they disintegrate into dust within ten seconds of leaving Carnage's body.<ref name=\"ASM 361\" /> Carnage also has the unique ability to warp his appendages into different arms, legs, and even wings. This is shown on several occasions when Carnage mutates his fingers and arms into what look like large swords.\n\nKasady has full control over the size, shape, color (usually red and black), texture, and hardness of his symbiote (and any part thereof). Like Venom, he can make his symbiote look like normal clothing (which he has done on rare occasion), or act as \"camouflage\". With the symbiote bonded to his bloodstream, he can \"regenerate\" his costume from scratch simply by bleeding. His symbiote has the peculiar ability to block its parent's ([[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]'s) ability to sense and track it.<ref name=\"Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004\" /> The symbiote is also able to rapidly adapt to new environments: when Kasady was taken into space by the Sentry,<ref name=\"New Avengers 1-2\">''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #1\u20132</ref> the Carnage symbiote was able to save his life by growing small sacks around his mouth that converted carbon dioxide into oxygen, allowing Kasady to stay alive long enough for him to be recovered.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\" />\n\nIn some interpretations, the Carnage symbiote is [[Vampire|vampiric]], feeding on and thus endangering his victims by only a mere touch.<ref name=\"New Avengers 1-2\" /> The symbiote has also shown the ability to call parts of itself back to the main symbiote, reintegrating them. It can also send irresistible commands to parts of itself that are in technology; these were used to break the bones of the Iron Rangers when they challenged Carnage while wearing symbiote-enhanced technological exo-suits. Using these last two abilities, Carnage absorbed the five Iron Rangers, grew to an enormous size, and became blue.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\" />\n\nFinally, Carnage's powers have always been abnormally enhanced from the maniacal will and insane worldview that Kasady has had from the age of 8 years old.<ref name=\"SM 36\">''Spider-Man'' No. 36</ref> Kasady sees chaos and random, undirected violence as reality, and considers order and virtue to be illusions.<ref name=\"ASM 361-363\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #361\u2013363</ref> He takes an almost artistic pride in his mayhem,<ref name=\"ASM 430-431\" /> likes to leave a trail for others to follow (usually leaving the phrase \"Carnage Rules\" written in his own blood), and is recklessly willing to take on the most dangerous and powerful opponents and victims.<ref name=\"ASM 361-363\" /> On rare occasions, however, he has deliberately spared individuals to serve as witnesses for others: for instance, [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joe Robertson]]'s wife Martha during ''Savage Rebirth''.<ref name=\"ASM 430\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 430</ref> Kasady is essentially taking revenge on the whole world for the torments, both real and imagined, of his childhood.<ref name=\"SM 36\" /><ref name=\"SM & B 1\">''Spider-Man and Batman'' No. 1</ref>\n\nWhen the Carnage symbiote was joined with Norman Osborn, the resulting combination was immune to traditional symbiote weaknesses of sound and fire, although Anti-Venom's touch was still dangerous.\n\n== Other versions ==\n\n=== Exiles ===\nThe Earth-15 psychotic Peter Parker and Carnage combine to become the \"'''Spider'''\", and becomes a member of [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#Weapon X|Weapon X]] in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''.<ref name=\"Exiles 13\">''Exiles'' No. 12</ref> He is killed when [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)#Exiles|Firestar]] explodes from her powers.<ref>''Exiles'' No. 44.</ref>\n\n=== MC2 ===\nIn the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] future timeline, Carnage, also known as '''Specimen 297''', bonds with [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]]'s friend '''Moose Mansfied''', who wanted to use the symbiote to cure his father from cancer.<ref name=\"ASG 9\">''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #9\u201312</ref> He also infects Spider-Girl's [[Benjamin Richard Parker|little brother]], turning him into a miniature version of himself. Spider-Girl uses the sonic blasters of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]] to destroy all traces of the symbiote.\n\nIn a later timeline, samples of the symbiote are used to create '''Biopreds''', living weapons that the government use to try to stop ''Mayhem'', Spider-Girl's part-symbiote clone, who, after killing the real Spider-Girl, became a murderous vigilante, eventually killing the hero [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]. The Biopreds run wild, however, decimating the world and its defenders. Mayhem, seeing the error of her ways, goes back in time and sacrifices herself to stop her past self from killing Spider-Girl, ensuring the events that led to the Biopreds' creation never occurred.<ref name=\"SG: The End\">''Spider-Girl: The End''</ref>\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Carnage is a self-regenerating vampiric organism. This version is created from DNA samples of both [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) and the [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Lizard]], and combined with samples from [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]]'s [[Alternative versions of Venom#Ultimate Marvel|symbiotic suit research]].\nWhen first introduced, the organism was a blob of instinct, with no intelligence or self-awareness, with its only aim to feed on the DNA of others, including [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]], to stabilize itself. After feeding on multiple people, Carnage turns into a damaged form of Richard. Carnage and Peter battle to which Peter throws Carnage into a fire factor steel chimney, killing the beast. But before its death, the organism splintered into a replica of Gwen's form.<ref name=\"USM 128\">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' No. 128</ref><ref name=\"USM Images\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRLD0R5aWfI&t=58s |title=best apps , Wikis, Cheats, Walkthroughs, Reviews, News & Videos&nbsp;\u2013 IGN |publisher= |via=YouTube}}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' No. 98 \"Gwen\" appears to have no memory of her \"death\" and believes she was in a hospital, from which she has escaped. In issue No. 100, after a raft of revelations, the stress of the situation enrages \"Gwen\". She transforms into Carnage before leaping out the window.{{issue|date=July 2013}} In the next issue, \"Richard Parker\" claims \"Gwen\" should not have met Peter at all, and was merely an experiment in [[stem cell research]]. This Gwen/Carnage fights with the [[Fantastic Four#Ultimate Marvel|Fantastic Four]], [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]], and the [[Spider-Slayer#Ultimate Marvel|Spider-Slayers]] drones, until she is knocked unconscious by a beam of light, and taken into custody. In issue No. 113, Norman Osborn as the [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Green Goblin]] causes a massive prison break from the [[Triskelion (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Triskelion]]. An inmate appearing to be 'Gwen' walks out amidst the chaos, disappearing in the shadows. It has been revealed the creature posing as Gwen Stacy is still the original Ultimate Carnage Spider-Man faced earlier in its run. After \"devouring\" Gwen, this incarnation of Carnage has gone on to mimic her \"essence\" and now believes itself to be Gwen Stacy.{{dead link|date=August 2013}}<ref>[https://ignitista.com \"Ultimate Spider-Man Pictures Full Size\"]. [[IGN]].</ref>\n\nDuring the \"War of the Symbiotes\" storyline, Gwen/Carnage's back story in the Triskelion is revealed. It is shown Gwen has been taking some form of therapy with [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Tony Stark]]. However, when the Green Goblin broke out of the Triskelion, Gwen escaped and went to Peter Parker's old house in a confused and terrified state, with Carnage's face on her body. During an exchange between Peter and Gwen, Eddie Brock attempts to attack Aunt May and retake his symbiote. In a rage, Spider-Man engages Eddie on a nearby rooftop. During the fight, Gwen is shown to be able to use her symbiote to fight off Eddie, but Eddie's symbiote reconstitutes itself upon contact with Carnage and absorbs the symbiote, rendering Gwen an ordinary girl.\n\n=== Marvel 1602 ===\nOn [[Marvel 1602|Earth-311]], '''Canice Cassidy''' believed that he was bonded to a demon and formed the universe's version of [[Sinister Six#Marvel 1602 Spider-Verse|Sinister Six]] called Sinister Sextet with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], Karnov (Earth-411's version of [[Kraven the Hunter]]), Magus (Earth-311's version of [[Mysterio]]), and Serpent (who is similar to [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]) as its members.

Its original host appeared in the episodes \"Venom Returns\", \"Carnage\" and \"The Haunting of Mary Jane Watson\". This version was never shown killing anyone but still a deranged psychopath with a heavy criminal record. Cletus is captured by the police after planning to explode a bomb over New York. In prison, he shares a cell with [[Eddie Brock]]. After the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote goes in their prison and rebonds with Brock and escapes, [[Baron Mordo]] appears in front of Cletus and explains that another symbiote has the same symbiotic powers. When Mordo makes a deal with this symbiote power in exchange for servitude to [[Dormammu]], Cletus accepts the offer and bonds with the new symbiote, turning into Carnage and escapes the prison. Carnage and Venom are given vampiric powers to steal life energy so that Dormammu can escape into this dimension and consume. Carnage mockingly refers to Venom as \"Dad\". Carnage abducts [[Ashley Kafka]], resulting in Venom teaming up with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Iron Man]]. After the final showdown, Carnage tried to drag Ashley into Dormammu's realm with him, but Eddie sacrificed himself to save Ashley and falls through the portal with Carnage. Carnage, Venom, and Dormammu are ultimately imprisoned in Dormammu's dimension. In the series finale, its second host appeared as Spider-Carnage.\n* The Carnage symbiote appears in the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Michael Donovan]] (Cletus Kasady).<ref name=\"Michael Donovan\">[http://www.tv.com/michael-donovan/person/10761/appearances.html TV.com:] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220125312/http://www.tv.com/michael-donovan/person/10761/appearances.html |date=February 20, 2008 }} Michael Donovan Credits</ref> Like Venom, this version had the ability to change into a somewhat liquid form while the default appearance changes to appear taller, skinnier, and with boney protrusions.\n* The Carnage symbiote was originally slated to appear if ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series had been renewed for a third season, but never appeared. Cletus Kasady however, does make a cameo in the Ravencroft Institute during a therapy session with other patients while wearing a Santa Claus hat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spidermancrawlspace.com/wordpress/2009/10/01/podcast-82-second-hour-of-spectacular-spider-man-interview/ |title=Podcast 82 September 2009 Second hour of Spectacular Spider-Man Interview |website=Spidermancrawlspace.com |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2011-02-08}}</ref>\n* The Carnage symbiote appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/ultimatespiderman/guides/episodes/|title=Marvel Animation Age&nbsp;\u2013 Ultimate Spider-Man|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive First Look: Ultimate Spider-Man Spins a Shocking, New Origin Story for [Spoiler]|url=http://tvline.com/2013/03/22/ultimate-spider-man-season-2-spoilers-origin-story-carnage/|publisher=TVLine}}</ref> voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] (humanoid form),<ref>{{cite episode|title=Carnage|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=8|airdate=March 31, 2013}}</ref> and by [[Fred Tatasciore]] (various hosts and giant form).<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Symbiote Saga Pt. 2|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=14|airdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref> The first version is a mutated form of the Venom symbiote.

Created by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]], the Carnage symbiote envelops [[Doctor Octopus]] as a host after Morbius is injected with Doc Ock's vampire bat serum, eventually being separated by Spider-Man and [[Flash Thompson]]. Upon gaining its own sentience as a hostless symbiote, Carnage fights with Spider-Man and Agent Venom which results in a symbiote bomb to spread to possesses multiple hosts (such as the [[Hulk]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]]) until the [[Anti-Venom (Marvel Comics)|Anti-Venom]] symbiote ultimately neutralized Carnage's swarm. However, Carnage's regenerated in a giant form that turned in a hive that Spider-Man, Agent Venom, and Patrioteer fought through in order to find the [[Mary Jane Watson|Carnage Queen]] in the center.\n* The Carnage symbiote appears in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' animated series. It's seen in the episodes \"Back in the New York Groove\" and \"Drive My Carnage\".\n* The Carnage symbiote alludes in the live-action series ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''; Karl Malus wears a pair of red glasses, which is a reference to Superior Carnage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/characters-already-mcu-tv/|title=25 Marvel Characters That Are Already in the MCU (And Most Fans Didn't Notice)|date=30 September 2018|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] will portray the [[Cletus Kasady]] version of Carnage in ''[[Venom 2]]'', which is scheduled for release in the United States on October 2, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/venom-sequel-woody-harrelson-carnage-marvel-1202530997/ |title=Sony's 'Venom' Sequel Taking Shape: Woody Harrelson's Carnage On The Way? |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |date=January 7, 2019 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108050743/https://deadline.com/2019/01/venom-sequel-woody-harrelson-carnage-marvel-1202530997/ |archive-date=January 8, 2019 |access-date=January 8, 2019}}</ref> who previously appeared in the  post-credits scene of the film's predecessor ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' as Kasady, foreshadowing his upcoming appearance.\n\n=== Video games ===\n* The Cletus Kasady version of Carnage was a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss character]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (1992 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' (1992), ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'', ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage]]'', ''[[Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' (2000) (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]).\n** In the 2000 ''Spider-Man'' video game, Carnage (Cletus Kasady) is helping [[Doctor Octopus]] with his plan to infest New York with symbiotes, which are cloned from Carnage's symbiote. Carnage serves as the game's penultimate boss and is fought immediately after defeating Doc Ock. After Spider-Man defeats Carnage using sonics, the symbiote attaches to Doctor Octopus instead, turning him into an out-of-control monster called '''[[Doctor Octopus|Monster-Ock]]''', which serves as the game's final boss. Monster Ock is too powerful to be fought directly, so Spider-Man is forced to run away from him through the underwater base. After a long chase, Monster Ock ends up destroying the entire base and is caught in the explosion, which removes the symbiote from Doctor Octopus.\n* The Ultimate Marvel iteration of the Carnage symbiote appears as the penultimate boss in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game. Unlike the Ultimate Marvel comics, this version of Carnage requires a host to survive rather than being an entity of its own, in this case the host being Peter Parker, and is created by [[Bolivar Trask|Trask]] Industries as a replacement for the Venom symbiote after they were unable to remove it from its host, Eddie Brock. When scientist [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes]] injects Peter with this makeshift sample of the symbiote, Carnage is born as a much more aggressive, out-of-control, and unstoppable symbiote than Venom, which escapes and begins wreaking havoc in the Trask Industries building, knocking Toomes unconscious in the process. After Carnage arrives in the room in which Eddie is being held captive, he transforms into Venom and escapes as well, fighting Carnage through the building. After defeating Carnage, Venom absorbs the symbiote off Peter and the combination between the two suits gives Eddie complete control over the Venom symbiote, symbolized by a white spider emblem appearing on Venom's chest.\n* The Cletus Kasady version of Carnage appears as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'' voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He is exclusive to the [[PlayStation Portable]] version of the game, but is still alluded at the end of all versions, when [[Nick Fury]] decides to call the study of the meteor shards responsible for all the events in the game \"Project Carnage\".\n* The Ultimate Marvel iteration of Carnage appears as a villain in the final Ultimate segment in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced again by Fred Tatasciore.<ref name=\"SM: Shattered Dim Prev\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/22/sdcc-10-spider-man-shattered-dimensions-preview|title=SDCC 10: Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions Preview|first=Greg|last=Miller|date=21 July 2010|publisher=}}</ref> Derived from [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]]'s DNA and the Venom symbiote, Carnage is an entity of its own, without a host, similar to the Ultimate Marvel comics. Carnage has been captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and brought to the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] along with a fragment from the Tablet of Order and Chaos, but S.H.I.E.L.D. foolishly making experiments on Carnage with the fragment behind [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]]\u2019s back allowed the symbiote to absorb it, which increased his powers to new levels. After escaping from his containment, Carnage used his new powers to drain the life from numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, which then reanimated into his mindless zombie minions (which slowly mutate into symbiote creatures like itself). After receiving an emergency call about what has happened, Spider-Man arrives at the Triskellion, which is now under Carnage's control and swarming with zombie agents, and pursues Carnage throughout the base's burning ruins, along the way dealing with the villain's numerous spawns and [[Spider-Slayer]]s armed with flamethrowers (which identify Spider-Man as a threat due to the use of the Venom symbiote suit). Cornering Carnage in his nest, which is located on the Triskelion's highest floor, Spider-Man fights him and his spawns with help from several reprogrammed Spider-Slayers and finally defeats the symbiote, leaving it pinned under rubble, while he claims the tablet fragment. During the credits, Carnage is shown posing for pictures in prison.\n* The Cletus Kasady version of Carnage appears as the final boss in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' voiced by David Agranov. Kasady first appears as a serial killer known as the \"Carnage Killer\", who is murdering other criminals; it is later revealed that Kasady was released from prison by [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] to go on a killing spree and terrorize the citizens of New York so that they would support his plans to redevelop the city. After Kasady murders [[Burglar (comics)|Dennis Carradine]], Spider-Man begins working with [[Kraven the Hunter]] (who is secretly working for Fisk to take down his rivals, including Kasady, whose killing spree has begun interfering with Fisk's plans) to track him down and they eventually confront him just as he was preparing to kill a civilian. Kasady claims that he and Spider-Man are very alike and fights him, but Spider-Man ultimately defeats him, although he refuses to kill Kasady after Kraven urges him to, leading to his arrest and imprisonment at Ravencroft, where he becomes the test subject of an experiment funded by Fisk that has Kasady injected with a red liquid substance code-named \"Venom\", which was initially meant to cure [[Norman Osborn]]'s illness. The experiment eventually gets out of control and allows Kasady to control the symbiote that he was injected with. Now calling himself \"Carnage\", he escapes and wreaks havoc at Ravencroft, infecting numerous other patients with his symbiote. When Spider-Man comes to investigate, he fights through the infected patients and eventually confronts Kasady. Despite being defeated by Spider-Man once again, Kasady fully bonds with the symbiote and becomes Carnage, serving as the final boss in the game. Spider-Man is able to defeat Carnage using fire, one of the symbiote's only known weaknesses besides sonics, and burns the symbiote off Kasady; he begs Spider-Man to let him die, but the hero refuses, saying that he and Kasady are very different and that he needs to face justice for his crimes. In the end, Kasady is returned to his cell, where the symbiote is completely removed from him.\n* The Carnage symbiote appears as a playable character in the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' mobile game via various hosts, most notably Cletus Kasady as \"Carnage\", and Ben Reilly as \"Spider-Carnage\". Carnage also serves as a boss in the limited time Symbiote World event.\n* The Carnage symbiote appears as a playable character in many Marvel related games via its most notable host Cletus Kasady.

Carnom fights and is defeated by the heroes, who free him from the Goblin's control. As the heroes claim the shard, Carnom starts chasing after Goblin 2099 in retaliation for its abuse.

The maze was designed to be a trip through Carnage's hideout and contained all his henchmen and the bloody remains of various Marvel superheroes. The house was located at [[Marvel Super Hero Island]] under the scare zone \"Island Under Siege\". Carnage also was the icon chosen to represent that specific island for the event, as he killed all of the superheroes and took over the \"island\", allowing criminals, gangbangers, and villains to roam free with no regards to law and order. The event's main icon, \"The Caretaker\", chose him based on his disregard for life and desire to see total chaos.<ref name=\"Horror Nights\">{{cite web|url=http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001073503/http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 October 2002|title=Hallowen Horror Nights|date=1 October 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"Open The Vault\">[http://www.hhnvault.com/haunts/hhn12_houses.htm Open the Vault.

The character belongs to a race of amorphous [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Parasitism|parasites]] known as the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiotes]]. The Carnage symbiote is usually depicted as an offspring of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].  The symbiote has taken many hosts. The original and most notable host is serial killer '''[[Cletus Kasady]]'''. Other hosts include [[Karl Malus]] and [[Norman Osborn]].\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe Carnage symbiote was derived by writer [[David Michelinie]] while [[Mark Bagley]] designed the Carnage symbiote. The symbiote was designed to be a darker version of Venom and was created due to the writers not wanting a replacement for [[Eddie Brock]] as Venom. Carnage was in part created due to Venom's immense popularity with fans. The character was originally meant to be named \"Chaos\"<ref>''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' Spider-Man Special, pg. 45</ref> and then \"Ravage\" before being settled on \"Carnage\".\n\n== Hosts ==\n=== Cletus Kasady ===\n{{Main|Cletus Kasady}}\nWhen [[Eddie Brock]]'s [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] soon returned to be bonded again, allowing Venom to escape prison, the symbiote left its offspring in the cell; due to its alien mindset, the symbiote felt no emotional attachment to its offspring, regarding it as insignificant, and thus never communicated its existence to Brock via their telepathic link. The new symbiote then bonded with Brock's cellmate [[Cletus Kasady]] through a cut on his hand, transforming him into Carnage.<ref name=\"ASM 344-345\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344\u2013345</ref> The bond between the Carnage symbiote and Kasady was stronger than the bond between Brock and the Venom symbiote. Cletus Kasady was also a serial killer and thought of as insane. As a result, Carnage is far more violent, powerful, and deadly than Venom.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Kasady and the symbiote would then be a main antagonist in \"[[Maximum Carnage]]\" and Kasady would continually be the most recurring character to use the Carnage symbiote in many publications.<ref name=\"Venom #1-4\">Venom #1-4</ref>\n<ref name=\"CarnageFF\">''Carnage'' #1\u20135</ref>\n\n=== Spider-Carnage (Ben Reilly) ===\n{{Main|Ben Reilly}}\nIt eventually transferred itself to Spider-Man\u2014[[Ben Reilly]] at the time\u2014when Ben bonded with it in order to prevent it from hurting any innocent people, creating Spider-Carnage. Ben's willpower held out against the symbiote's murderous desires long enough for him to return it to Ravencroft. Reilly subsequently attempted to destroy the symbiote by subjecting himself to a potentially lethal blast of microwaves, but it escaped back to Kasady after the microwaves forced it to separate from him.<ref name=\"Spider-Carnage\">''Sensational Spider-Man'' No. 3, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 410, ''Spider-Man'' No. 67, and ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' No. 233</ref>\n\n=== Superior Carnage (Karl Malus) ===\n{{Main|Karl Malus}}\nAfter Kasady was lobotomized, he was broken out of prison by the [[Wizard (comics)|Wizard]] and [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], who intend to recruit him into the Frightful Four and turn him into their own version of Venom. After a failed attempt to control Kasady, Wizard transfers the Symbiote to Dr. [[Karl Malus]]. Dr. Malus was enraged and under the influences of the Symbiote tried to kill his teammates, but he was subdued by Klaw and controlled by Wizard, who renames him \"Superior Carnage\" and equips him with weapons.<ref name=\"SupCar\">''Superior Carnage'' #1\u20135</ref>\n\nThe trio are confronted by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] and during their battle the Wizard loses his control over Carnage and he is fatally injured once Spider-Man accidentally drops him due to the shock of finding out Wizard read his mind and knows about Otto Octvaius. Carnage, now free, goes on a rampage and starts to kill anyone in front of him. Klaw tries to stop him, but due to his weapon being damaged he fails and realizes that the only way is for the Wizard to take back control. Both Carnage and Klaw make their way outside. Carnage fights the Superior Spider-Man and admits that although he liked using weapons, for him ripping and slashing the bodies is better. Klaw tries to get the Wizard to control Carnage again, but is killed by Carnage and the explosion separates the Symbiote from its host, only to bond with the injured Wizard.<ref name=\"SupCar\" />\n\n=== Red Goblin (Norman Osborn) ===\n{{Main|Norman Osborn}}\nFollowing the events of ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'', the Carnage symbiote was stolen from an old S.H.I.E.L.D. storehouse by the then-powerless [[Norman Osborn]].<ref name=\"ASM 794\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 794</ref> He initially found himself overwhelmed by the symbiote's desire for mindless slaughter when he allowed it to merge with him,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 795</ref> but he has been able to 'persuade' the symbiote to let him take control of Carnage's powers to show it something other than 'boring' mindless slaughter.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 796</ref> Using this combination of powers during the \"[[Go Down Swinging (comic book)|Go Down Swinging]]\" storyline, Norman is easily able to tear through [[Human Torch]], [[Clash (comics)|Clash]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]], [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], and [[Anti-Venom (Marvel Comics)|Agent Anti-Venom]], with the combination of the symbiote and the Goblin serum rendering Carnage immune to its traditional weaknesses, eventually transferring part of the symbiote to his grandson Normie enough to turn him into a miniature version of Red Goblin.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 799</ref> The Carnage symbiote is seemingly destroyed by Spider-Man when he hits it with an exploding gas tank, however, because the symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe's mind. Later as Spider-Man visits Norman in Ravencroft, it's revealed that Norman's mind appears to have been completely fried and now believes that Spider-Man is actually Norman Osborn and he is Cletus Kasady. It's not clear whether or not he's faking it or if he had actually lost his mind. Meanwhile, Harry manages to remove the Carnage symbiote from Normie. Not all of it has gone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 800</ref>\n\n=== Eddie Brock ===\n{{Main|Eddie Brock}}\nFollowing the defeat of Cletus Kassady, Carnage and the gestalt symbiotes were absorbed by Eddie Brock who later is given an offer to join the Avengers, but in the middle of his big day Carnage is able to overcome Venom and takes over. Eddie leaves before things get out of hand leaving the Avengers with strange reactions. Eddie gets back home and tries to quiet the Carnage in a way he has done before with Venom, heavy medication. Eddie passes out and has a vision of Knull. This causes Eddie to take off and head towards the island where he long ago had thought he had kill Spider-Man and where he remained until the emergence of Carnage. But Carnage catches on to Eddie's thoughts and causes the plane to crash land. Separated from the Carnage symbiote, Eddie is ready to face it off.<ref>''Venom'' #21</ref>\n\n=== Other hosts ===\nThere have been other, shorter term hosts for the symbiote.\n\n==== John Jameson ====\n{{Main|John Jameson (comics)}}\nThough bonded to Kasady's bloodstream the symbiote found a way to ditch its host by travelling through the Ravencroft Institute's water pipes overwhelming Ravencroft's chief, John Jameson. Carnage used him to commit further murders before eventually bonding with Spider-man, who was Ben Reilly at the time.<ref name=\"Spider-Carnage\" />\n\n==== Carnage Cosmic (Norrin Radd) ====\n{{Main|Silver Surfer}}\nDuring a subsequent rampage, the Carnage symbiote briefly attempted to take control of the [[Silver Surfer]], who was visiting Earth at the time to welcome the [[Fantastic Four]] after their return to life following the battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. As it turned out, [[Galactus]] had consumed a planet that many Symbiotes lived on, and the species had made it a race memory so that each future Symbiote could remember it, as well as the Surfer who had been Galactus's herald at the time. Upon seeing the Silver Surfer, the Carnage Symbiote abandoned Kasady and bonded with the Silver Surfer, becoming the Carnage Cosmic. Spider-Man and the Surfer managed to return the Symbiote to Kasady, who was dying from stomach cancer, and then the Silver Surfer proceeded to seal both host and Symbiote in an unbreakable prison in an attempt to force him to reflect on his sins for eternity.<ref name=\"ASM 430-431\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430\u2013431</ref>\n\n==== Scorn (Tanis Nevies) ====\n{{Main|Scorn (Marvel Comics)}}\nAfter Carnage was ripped in half by the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] outside the Earth atmosphere<ref name=\"The Avengers 1-2\">''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #1\u20132</ref> it is later discovered that, although the host was presumably killed, the symbiote survived by becoming dormant and returned to Earth, where it was discovered by Michael Hall, a competitor of [[Tony Stark]]. He brought [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] and her doctor, Tanis Nevies, so he could use Shriek to keep the symbiote alive in order of using the properties of the symbiote, to create prosthetic limbs and exo-suits which respond in the same ways as a symbiote. One such person, Dr. Tanis Nieves, is outfitted with one of these prosthetic arms after she is caught in an attack by the [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]], who tried to rescue Shriek.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\">''Carnage'' #1\u20135</ref> When near the symbiote, her arm goes wild and forces her to kill several scientists before the symbiote forcefully bonds to her, becoming the new Carnage.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\" /> After the symbiote uses Tanis to break into a Hall Corporation facility, it is revealed that Kasady is alive (although both of his legs have been severed), his body preserved by the symbiote and repaired by Hall's prosthetics.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\" /> Kasady reclaims the symbiote and becomes Carnage once more, attempting to avenge his captivity while Spider-Man and Iron Man struggle to stop him. It is then revealed that Carnage was once again pregnant, and the suit's spawn briefly bonds to Tanis, but she removes it from herself and the symbiote bonds to Shriek before being torn from her. Scared of Shriek's malice, the symbiote arm then rebonds to Tanis, creating a new hero, Scorn, who defeats Shriek and forces her to use her sonic shriek to weaken Carnage, but he escapes.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\" />\n\n==== Wizard (Bentley Wittman) ====\nUltimately, Spider-Man brings out Kasady's body to successfully draw the symbiote into it, which immediately devours Dr. Malus and then prepares to finish off the Wizard. However, Klaw ephemeral spirit focuses his sound manipulation powers one last time for a split second to create a powerful sonic blast that disables Carnage, allowing the symbiote to be recaptured. In the epilogue it is shown that the symbiote has managed to repair the Wizard's and Kasady's brain damage.<ref name=\"SupCar\" />\n\n==== Carla Unger ====\nAfter the symbiote had died in captivity, a sample of the symbiote was being examined by Dr. Carla Unger, until the sample entered into her body. When she went home, the symbiote formed around her and then she with the symbiote killed her abusive husband. After that, the symbiote consumed her and went to other hosts to get back to Kasady. When the symbiote arrived to an injured Kasady, a scientist, who wanted the symbiote for himself tried to kill Kasady, but the symbiote rebonded to Cletus.<ref>''Superior Carnage Annual'' No. 1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==== Goblin Childe (Normie Osborn) ====\n{{Main|Normie Osborn}}\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\n{{Main|Symbiote (comics)#Biology}}\nAs Eddie Brock explained,<ref name=\"ASM 362\">The Amazing Spider-Man No. 362</ref> the Carnage symbiote was born with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor\u2014due to the fact that it gestated in an environment alien to it\u2014[[Earth]]. The alien symbiote endows Kasady with physical strength greater than that of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] combined<ref name=\"ASM 362\" /> and shape-shifting abilities, allows him to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables him to plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote [[tendril]].<ref name=\"Carnage: Mind Bomb\">''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' one-shot</ref> Much like Spider-Man, Kasady has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has a version of Spider-Man's spider-sense, as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to \"see\" in any direction, warning him of incoming threats.<ref name=\"ASM 361\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #361</ref><ref name=\"SMU 2\">''Spider-Man Unlimited #2''</ref> He can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick surfaces. The Carnage symbiote has abilities similar to those of Spider-Man as a direct result of the Venom symbiote's first host, Peter Parker, who transferred some of Spider-Man's power into the symbiote.\n\nHe is able to regenerate damaged body tissues much faster and more extensively than that of an ordinary human. This has been shown as powerful enough to allow him to regenerate from losing any part of body, from head to feet.<ref name=\"Venom Vol 2 #27\">''Venom Vol 2 #27''</ref><ref name=\"AXIS: Carnage #3\">''AXIS:Carnage #3''</ref> However, after being torn in half by the Sentry, he was fitted with artificial legs, but this occurred while he was separated from the symbiote.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\" /> Kasady is also immune to the effects of all Earthly diseases and infections as long as he remains bonded with the symbiote. Like Venom, the symbiote is vulnerable to sound (to a much smaller degree than Venom) and heat (to a much larger degree than Venom),<ref name=\"Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004\">''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man'', 2004</ref> and is undetectable to Spider-Man's spider-sense. Unlike Venom, Carnage can launch parts of his symbiote at enemies in the form of solid weapons such as darts, spears, knives, axes, etc., although they disintegrate into dust within ten seconds of leaving Carnage's body.<ref name=\"ASM 361\" /> Carnage also has the unique ability to warp his appendages into different arms, legs, and even wings. This is shown on several occasions when Carnage mutates his fingers and arms into what look like large swords.\n\nKasady has full control over the size, shape, color (usually red and black), texture, and hardness of his symbiote (and any part thereof). Like Venom, he can make his symbiote look like normal clothing (which he has done on rare occasion), or act as \"camouflage\". With the symbiote bonded to his bloodstream, he can \"regenerate\" his costume from scratch simply by bleeding. His symbiote has the peculiar ability to block its parent's ([[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]'s) ability to sense and track it.<ref name=\"Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004\" /> The symbiote is also able to rapidly adapt to new environments: when Kasady was taken into space by the Sentry,<ref name=\"New Avengers 1-2\">''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #1\u20132</ref> the Carnage symbiote was able to save his life by growing small sacks around his mouth that converted carbon dioxide into oxygen, allowing Kasady to stay alive long enough for him to be recovered.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\" />\n\nIn some interpretations, the Carnage symbiote is [[Vampire|vampiric]], feeding on and thus endangering his victims by only a mere touch.<ref name=\"New Avengers 1-2\" /> The symbiote has also shown the ability to call parts of itself back to the main symbiote, reintegrating them. It can also send irresistible commands to parts of itself that are in technology; these were used to break the bones of the Iron Rangers when they challenged Carnage while wearing symbiote-enhanced technological exo-suits. Using these last two abilities, Carnage absorbed the five Iron Rangers, grew to an enormous size, and became blue.<ref name=\"CarnageFF\" />\n\nFinally, Carnage's powers have always been abnormally enhanced from the maniacal will and insane worldview that Kasady has had from the age of 8 years old.<ref name=\"SM 36\">''Spider-Man'' No. 36</ref> Kasady sees chaos and random, undirected violence as reality, and considers order and virtue to be illusions.<ref name=\"ASM 361-363\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #361\u2013363</ref> He takes an almost artistic pride in his mayhem,<ref name=\"ASM 430-431\" /> likes to leave a trail for others to follow (usually leaving the phrase \"Carnage Rules\" written in his own blood), and is recklessly willing to take on the most dangerous and powerful opponents and victims.<ref name=\"ASM 361-363\" /> On rare occasions, however, he has deliberately spared individuals to serve as witnesses for others: for instance, [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joe Robertson]]'s wife Martha during ''Savage Rebirth''.<ref name=\"ASM 430\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 430</ref> Kasady is essentially taking revenge on the whole world for the torments, both real and imagined, of his childhood.<ref name=\"SM 36\" /><ref name=\"SM & B 1\">''Spider-Man and Batman'' No. 1</ref>\n\nWhen the Carnage symbiote was joined with Norman Osborn, the resulting combination was immune to traditional symbiote weaknesses of sound and fire, although Anti-Venom's touch was still dangerous.\n\n== Other versions ==\n\n=== Exiles ===\nThe Earth-15 psychotic Peter Parker and Carnage combine to become the \"'''Spider'''\", and becomes a member of [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#Weapon X|Weapon X]] in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''.<ref name=\"Exiles 13\">''Exiles'' No. 12</ref> He is killed when [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)#Exiles|Firestar]] explodes from her powers.<ref>''Exiles'' No. 44.</ref>\n\n=== MC2 ===\nIn the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] future timeline, Carnage, also known as '''Specimen 297''', bonds with [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]]'s friend '''Moose Mansfied''', who wanted to use the symbiote to cure his father from cancer.<ref name=\"ASG 9\">''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #9\u201312</ref> He also infects Spider-Girl's [[Benjamin Richard Parker|little brother]], turning him into a miniature version of himself. Spider-Girl uses the sonic blasters of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]] to destroy all traces of the symbiote.\n\nIn a later timeline, samples of the symbiote are used to create '''Biopreds''', living weapons that the government use to try to stop ''Mayhem'', Spider-Girl's part-symbiote clone, who, after killing the real Spider-Girl, became a murderous vigilante, eventually killing the hero [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]. The Biopreds run wild, however, decimating the world and its defenders. Mayhem, seeing the error of her ways, goes back in time and sacrifices herself to stop her past self from killing Spider-Girl, ensuring the events that led to the Biopreds' creation never occurred.<ref name=\"SG: The End\">''Spider-Girl: The End''</ref>\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Carnage is a self-regenerating vampiric organism. This version is created from DNA samples of both [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) and the [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Lizard]], and combined with samples from [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]]'s [[Alternative versions of Venom#Ultimate Marvel|symbiotic suit research]].\nWhen first introduced, the organism was a blob of instinct, with no intelligence or self-awareness, with its only aim to feed on the DNA of others, including [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]], to stabilize itself. After feeding on multiple people, Carnage turns into a damaged form of Richard. Carnage and Peter battle to which Peter throws Carnage into a fire factor steel chimney, killing the beast. But before its death, the organism splintered into a replica of Gwen's form.<ref name=\"USM 128\">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' No. 128</ref><ref name=\"USM Images\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRLD0R5aWfI&t=58s |title=best apps , Wikis, Cheats, Walkthroughs, Reviews, News & Videos&nbsp;\u2013 IGN |publisher= |via=YouTube}}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' No. 98 \"Gwen\" appears to have no memory of her \"death\" and believes she was in a hospital, from which she has escaped.

In issue No. 113, Norman Osborn as the [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Green Goblin]] causes a massive prison break from the [[Triskelion (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Triskelion]]. An inmate appearing to be 'Gwen' walks out amidst the chaos, disappearing in the shadows. It has been revealed the creature posing as Gwen Stacy is still the original Ultimate Carnage Spider-Man faced earlier in its run.

It is shown Gwen has been taking some form of therapy with [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Tony Stark]]. However, when the Green Goblin broke out of the Triskelion, Gwen escaped and went to Peter Parker's old house in a confused and terrified state, with Carnage's face on her body. During an exchange between Peter and Gwen, Eddie Brock attempts to attack Aunt May and retake his symbiote. In a rage, Spider-Man engages Eddie on a nearby rooftop. During the fight, Gwen is shown to be able to use her symbiote to fight off Eddie, but Eddie's symbiote reconstitutes itself upon contact with Carnage and absorbs the symbiote, rendering Gwen an ordinary girl.\n\n=== Marvel 1602 ===\nOn [[Marvel 1602|Earth-311]], '''Canice Cassidy''' believed that he was bonded to a demon and formed the universe's version of [[Sinister Six#Marvel 1602 Spider-Verse|Sinister Six]] called Sinister Sextet with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], Karnov (Earth-411's version of [[Kraven the Hunter]]), Magus (Earth-311's version of [[Mysterio]]), and Serpent (who is similar to [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]) as its members.

Its original host appeared in the episodes \"Venom Returns\", \"Carnage\" and \"The Haunting of Mary Jane Watson\". This version was never shown killing anyone but still a deranged psychopath with a heavy criminal record. Cletus is captured by the police after planning to explode a bomb over New York. In prison, he shares a cell with [[Eddie Brock]]. After the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote goes in their prison and rebonds with Brock and escapes, [[Baron Mordo]] appears in front of Cletus and explains that another symbiote has the same symbiotic powers. When Mordo makes a deal with this symbiote power in exchange for servitude to [[Dormammu]], Cletus accepts the offer and bonds with the new symbiote, turning into Carnage and escapes the prison. Carnage and Venom are given vampiric powers to steal life energy so that Dormammu can escape into this dimension and consume. Carnage mockingly refers to Venom as \"Dad\". Carnage abducts [[Ashley Kafka]], resulting in Venom teaming up with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Iron Man]]. After the final showdown, Carnage tried to drag Ashley into Dormammu's realm with him, but Eddie sacrificed himself to save Ashley and falls through the portal with Carnage. Carnage, Venom, and Dormammu are ultimately imprisoned in Dormammu's dimension. In the series finale, its second host appeared as Spider-Carnage.\n* The Carnage symbiote appears in the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Michael Donovan]] (Cletus Kasady).<ref name=\"Michael Donovan\">[http://www.tv.com/michael-donovan/person/10761/appearances.html TV.com:] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220125312/http://www.tv.com/michael-donovan/person/10761/appearances.html |date=February 20, 2008 }} Michael Donovan Credits</ref> Like Venom, this version had the ability to change into a somewhat liquid form while the default appearance changes to appear taller, skinnier, and with boney protrusions.\n* The Carnage symbiote was originally slated to appear if ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series had been renewed for a third season, but never appeared.

It's seen in the episodes \"Back in the New York Groove\" and \"Drive My Carnage\".\n* The Carnage symbiote alludes in the live-action series ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''; Karl Malus wears a pair of red glasses, which is a reference to Superior Carnage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/characters-already-mcu-tv/|title=25 Marvel Characters That Are Already in the MCU (And Most Fans Didn't Notice)|date=30 September 2018|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] will portray the [[Cletus Kasady]] version of Carnage in ''[[Venom 2]]'', which is scheduled for release in the United States on October 2, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/venom-sequel-woody-harrelson-carnage-marvel-1202530997/ |title=Sony's 'Venom' Sequel Taking Shape: Woody Harrelson's Carnage On The Way? |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |date=January 7, 2019 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108050743/https://deadline.com/2019/01/venom-sequel-woody-harrelson-carnage-marvel-1202530997/ |archive-date=January 8, 2019 |access-date=January 8, 2019}}</ref> who previously appeared in the  post-credits scene of the film's predecessor ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' as Kasady, foreshadowing his upcoming appearance.\n\n=== Video games ===\n* The Cletus Kasady version of Carnage was a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss character]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (1992 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' (1992), ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'', ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage]]'', ''[[Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' (2000) (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]).\n** In the 2000 ''Spider-Man'' video game, Carnage (Cletus Kasady) is helping [[Doctor Octopus]] with his plan to infest New York with symbiotes, which are cloned from Carnage's symbiote. Carnage serves as the game's penultimate boss and is fought immediately after defeating Doc Ock. After Spider-Man defeats Carnage using sonics, the symbiote attaches to Doctor Octopus instead, turning him into an out-of-control monster called '''[[Doctor Octopus|Monster-Ock]]''', which serves as the game's final boss. Monster Ock is too powerful to be fought directly, so Spider-Man is forced to run away from him through the underwater base. After a long chase, Monster Ock ends up destroying the entire base and is caught in the explosion, which removes the symbiote from Doctor Octopus.\n* The Ultimate Marvel iteration of the Carnage symbiote appears as the penultimate boss in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game. Unlike the Ultimate Marvel comics, this version of Carnage requires a host to survive rather than being an entity of its own, in this case the host being Peter Parker, and is created by [[Bolivar Trask|Trask]] Industries as a replacement for the Venom symbiote after they were unable to remove it from its host, Eddie Brock. When scientist [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes]] injects Peter with this makeshift sample of the symbiote, Carnage is born as a much more aggressive, out-of-control, and unstoppable symbiote than Venom, which escapes and begins wreaking havoc in the Trask Industries building, knocking Toomes unconscious in the process. After Carnage arrives in the room in which Eddie is being held captive, he transforms into Venom and escapes as well, fighting Carnage through the building. After defeating Carnage, Venom absorbs the symbiote off Peter and the combination between the two suits gives Eddie complete control over the Venom symbiote, symbolized by a white spider emblem appearing on Venom's chest.\n* The Cletus Kasady version of Carnage appears as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'' voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He is exclusive to the [[PlayStation Portable]] version of the game, but is still alluded at the end of all versions, when [[Nick Fury]] decides to call the study of the meteor shards responsible for all the events in the game \"Project Carnage\".\n* The Ultimate Marvel iteration of Carnage appears as a villain in the final Ultimate segment in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced again by Fred Tatasciore.<ref name=\"SM: Shattered Dim Prev\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/22/sdcc-10-spider-man-shattered-dimensions-preview|title=SDCC 10: Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions Preview|first=Greg|last=Miller|date=21 July 2010|publisher=}}</ref> Derived from [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]]'s DNA and the Venom symbiote, Carnage is an entity of its own, without a host, similar to the Ultimate Marvel comics. Carnage has been captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and brought to the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] along with a fragment from the Tablet of Order and Chaos, but S.H.I.E.L.D. foolishly making experiments on Carnage with the fragment behind [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]]\u2019s back allowed the symbiote to absorb it, which increased his powers to new levels. After escaping from his containment, Carnage used his new powers to drain the life from numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, which then reanimated into his mindless zombie minions (which slowly mutate into symbiote creatures like itself). After receiving an emergency call about what has happened, Spider-Man arrives at the Triskellion, which is now under Carnage's control and swarming with zombie agents, and pursues Carnage throughout the base's burning ruins, along the way dealing with the villain's numerous spawns and [[Spider-Slayer]]s armed with flamethrowers (which identify Spider-Man as a threat due to the use of the Venom symbiote suit). Cornering Carnage in his nest, which is located on the Triskelion's highest floor, Spider-Man fights him and his spawns with help from several reprogrammed Spider-Slayers and finally defeats the symbiote, leaving it pinned under rubble, while he claims the tablet fragment. During the credits, Carnage is shown posing for pictures in prison.\n* The Cletus Kasady version of Carnage appears as the final boss in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' voiced by David Agranov. Kasady first appears as a serial killer known as the \"Carnage Killer\", who is murdering other criminals; it is later revealed that Kasady was released from prison by [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] to go on a killing spree and terrorize the citizens of New York so that they would support his plans to redevelop the city. After Kasady murders [[Burglar (comics)|Dennis Carradine]], Spider-Man begins working with [[Kraven the Hunter]] (who is secretly working for Fisk to take down his rivals, including Kasady, whose killing spree has begun interfering with Fisk's plans) to track him down and they eventually confront him just as he was preparing to kill a civilian. Kasady claims that he and Spider-Man are very alike and fights him, but Spider-Man ultimately defeats him, although he refuses to kill Kasady after Kraven urges him to, leading to his arrest and imprisonment at Ravencroft, where he becomes the test subject of an experiment funded by Fisk that has Kasady injected with a red liquid substance code-named \"Venom\", which was initially meant to cure [[Norman Osborn]]'s illness. The experiment eventually gets out of control and allows Kasady to control the symbiote that he was injected with. Now calling himself \"Carnage\", he escapes and wreaks havoc at Ravencroft, infecting numerous other patients with his symbiote. When Spider-Man comes to investigate, he fights through the infected patients and eventually confronts Kasady. Despite being defeated by Spider-Man once again, Kasady fully bonds with the symbiote and becomes Carnage, serving as the final boss in the game. Spider-Man is able to defeat Carnage using fire, one of the symbiote's only known weaknesses besides sonics, and burns the symbiote off Kasady; he begs Spider-Man to let him die, but the hero refuses, saying that he and Kasady are very different and that he needs to face justice for his crimes. In the end, Kasady is returned to his cell, where the symbiote is completely removed from him.\n* The Carnage symbiote appears as a playable character in the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' mobile game via various hosts, most notably Cletus Kasady as \"Carnage\", and Ben Reilly as \"Spider-Carnage\". Carnage also serves as a boss in the limited time Symbiote World event.\n* The Carnage symbiote appears as a playable character in many Marvel related games via its most notable host Cletus Kasady.

Later, [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#2099|Green Goblin 2099]] uses a shard of the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|Nexus of All Realities]] to fuse the Venom symbiote and the Carnage symbiote into a new creature, dubbed \"'''[[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Carnom]]'''\" by Spider-Man, who is being controlled by the Goblin himself. Carnom fights and is defeated by the heroes, who free him from the Goblin's control. As the heroes claim the shard, Carnom starts chasing after Goblin 2099 in retaliation for its abuse. Both the original Carnage (Cletus Kasady) and Carnom are available as playable characters in the game.\n\n=== Attractions ===\nDuring the 2002 [[Halloween Horror Nights]], [[Universal Orlando]]'s [[Islands of Adventure]] featured a haunted maze entitled \"Maximum Carnage\". The maze was designed to be a trip through Carnage's hideout and contained all his henchmen and the bloody remains of various Marvel superheroes. The house was located at [[Marvel Super Hero Island]] under the scare zone \"Island Under Siege\". Carnage also was the icon chosen to represent that specific island for the event, as he killed all of the superheroes and took over the \"island\", allowing criminals, gangbangers, and villains to roam free with no regards to law and order. The event's main icon, \"The Caretaker\", chose him based on his disregard for life and desire to see total chaos.<ref name=\"Horror Nights\">{{cite web|url=http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001073503/http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 October 2002|title=Hallowen Horror Nights|date=1 October 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"Open The Vault\">[http://www.hhnvault.com/haunts/hhn12_houses.htm Open the Vault.

It is housed in the Scuola della Carit\u00e0 on the south bank of the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]], within the [[sestiere]] of [[Dorsoduro]]. It was originally the gallery of the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia]], the art academy of Venice, from which it became independent in 1879, and for which the [[Ponte dell'Accademia]] and the Accademia boat landing station for the ''[[vaporetto]]'' water bus are named. The two institutions remained in the same building until 2004, when the art school moved to the [[Ospedale degli Incurabili, Venice|Ospedale degli Incurabili]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n{{main|Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia}}\nThe Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia was founded on 24 September 1750; the statute dates from 1756.<ref name=acc>[http://www.accademiavenezia.it/accademia.php?id=1 Accademia di belle arti di Venezia, 1750\u20132010.

The name was changed from Veneta Academia di Pittura, Scultura e Architettura to Accademia Reale di Belle Arti, \"royal academy of fine arts\", and the academy was moved to the [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] complex of the [[Scuola della Carit\u00e0]], where the Gallerie dell'Accademia are still housed.

The Scuola della Carit\u00e0, the [[Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi]] and the church of Santa Maria della Carit\u00e0 thus became the home of the Accademia. The Scuola della Carit\u00e0 was the oldest of the six [[Scuole Grandi of Venice|Scuole Grandi]] and the building dates back to 1343, though the scuola was formed in 1260. The Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi was started in 1561 by [[Andrea Palladio]], though it was never fully completed.

It is housed in the Scuola della Carit\u00e0 on the south bank of the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]], within the [[sestiere]] of [[Dorsoduro]]. It was originally the gallery of the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia]], the art academy of Venice, from which it became independent in 1879, and for which the [[Ponte dell'Accademia]] and the Accademia boat landing station for the ''[[vaporetto]]'' water bus are named. The two institutions remained in the same building until 2004, when the art school moved to the [[Ospedale degli Incurabili, Venice|Ospedale degli Incurabili]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n{{main|Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia}}\nThe Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia was founded on 24 September 1750; the statute dates from 1756.<ref name=acc>[http://www.accademiavenezia.it/accademia.php?id=1 Accademia di belle arti di Venezia, 1750\u20132010.

The name was changed from Veneta Academia di Pittura, Scultura e Architettura to Accademia Reale di Belle Arti, \"royal academy of fine arts\", and the academy was moved to the [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] complex of the [[Scuola della Carit\u00e0]], where the Gallerie dell'Accademia are still housed. The collections of the Accademia were first opened to the public on 10 August 1817.<ref name=acc/><ref name=polo>[http://www.polomuseale.venezia.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/145/storia-delle-collezioni Gallerie dell'Accademia: Storia delle collezioni] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019004934/http://www.polomuseale.venezia.beniculturali.it/index.php?it%2F145%2Fstoria-delle-collezioni |date=2014-10-19 }} (in Italian).

Like other state museums in Italy, it falls under the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (Italy)|Ministero per i Beni e le Attivit\u00e0 Culturali]], the Italian ministry of culture and heritage.\n\n==Building==\n\nThe Napoleonic administration had disbanded many institutions in Venice including some churches, convents and [[Scuole Grandi of Venice|Scuole]]. The Scuola della Carit\u00e0, the [[Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi]] and the church of Santa Maria della Carit\u00e0 thus became the home of the Accademia. The Scuola della Carit\u00e0 was the oldest of the six [[Scuole Grandi of Venice|Scuole Grandi]] and the building dates back to 1343, though the scuola was formed in 1260. The Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi was started in 1561 by [[Andrea Palladio]], though it was never fully completed. The facade of Santa Maria della Carit\u00e0 was completed in 1441 by [[Bartolomeo Bon]].\n\n==Collection==\n[[Image:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'']]\n\n{{category see also|Collections of the Gallerie dell'Accademia}}\n\nThe Gallerie dell\u2019Accademia contains masterpieces of Venetian painting up to the 18th century, generally arranged chronologically though some thematic displays are evident.\n\nArtists represented include:\n[[Antonello da Messina]], \n[[Lazzaro Bastiani]],\n[[Gentile Bellini|Gentile]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]], \n[[Bernardo Bellotto]], \n[[Pacino di Bonaguida]],<ref>[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=1187 Pacino di Bonaguida] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713205633/http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=1187 |date=2010-07-13 }}, [[J.

In 2019, the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] in Paris requested the loan of the drawing for its exhibition of works by Leonardo. The request was refused by a cultural heritage group.

Included with [[Titian]], a generation older, and [[Tintoretto]], a decade senior, Veronese is one of the \"great trio that dominated Venetian painting of the ''[[cinquecento]]''\" and the [[Late Renaissance]] in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Rosand, 107\">Rosand, 107</ref> Known as a supreme colorist, and after an early period with [[Mannerism]], Paolo Veronese developed a naturalist style of painting, influenced by Titian.<ref>Freedburg, 550\u2013551</ref>\n[[Image:Paolo Veronese - The Family of Darius before Alexander - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|400px|''[[The Family of Darius before Alexander]]'' (1565\u20131570). Oil on canvas, 236.2cm \u00d7 475.9 cm, [[National Gallery]], London.]]\n\nHis most famous works are elaborate narrative cycles, executed in a dramatic and colorful style, full of majestic architectural settings and glittering pageantry. His large paintings of biblical feasts, crowded with figures, painted for the refectories of monasteries in Venice and Verona are especially famous, and he was also the leading Venetian painter of ceilings. Most of these works remain ''in situ'', or at least in Venice, and his representation in most museums is mainly composed of smaller works such as portraits that do not always show him at his best or most typical.\n\nHe has always been appreciated for \"the chromatic brilliance of his palette, the splendor and sensibility of his brushwork, the aristocratic elegance of his figures, and the magnificence of his spectacle\", but his work has been felt \"not to permit expression of the profound, the human, or the sublime\", and of the \"great trio\" he has often been the least appreciated by modern criticism.<ref name=\"Rosand, 107\"/> Nonetheless, \"many of the greatest artists ... may be counted among his admirers, including [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]\".<ref name=\"Penny, 333\">Penny, 333</ref>\n\n==Life and work==\n[[File:Castelvecchio06q-Veronese.jpg|thumb|left|''Deposition of Christ'', c. 1547]]\n\n===Birth and names===\nVeronese took his usual name from his birthplace of [[Verona]], then the largest possession of Venice on the mainland. The census in Verona attests that Veronese was born sometime in 1528 to a stonecutter, or ''spezapreda'' in the [[Venetian language]], named Gabriele, and his wife Caterina. He was their fifth child.<ref>Pedrocco, Filippo: \"Veronese\", page 3. SCALA Group S.p.A., 1998.</ref> It was common for surnames to be taken from a father's profession, and thus Veronese was known as Paolo Spezapreda. He later changed his name to Paolo Caliari, because his mother was the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman called Antonio Caliari.<ref name=\"Penny, 331\">Penny, 331</ref>  His earliest known painting is signed \"P. Caliari F., \"the first known instance in which he used this surname\", and after using \"Paolo Veronese\" for several years in Venice, after about 1575 he resumed signing his paintings as \"Paolo Caliari\".<ref name=\"Penny, 331\"/>  He was often called \"Paolo Veronese\" before the last century to distinguish him from another painter from Verona, \"Alessandro Veronese\", now known as [[Alessandro Turchi]] (1578\u20131649).<ref>Penny, 333 Note 1</ref>\n\n===Youth===\n[[File:Paolo Veronese, The Conversion of Mary Magdalene.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Conversion of Mary Magdalene]]'', c. 1548]]\nBy 1541, Veronese was apprenticed with [[Antonio Badile]], who was later to become his father-in-law, and in 1544 was an apprentice of [[Giovanni Francesco Caroto]]; both were leading painters in Verona.<ref name=\"Penny, 331\"/>  An altarpiece painted by Badile in 1543 includes striking passages that were most likely the work of his fifteen-year-old apprentice; Veronese's precocious gifts soon surpassed the level of the workshop, and by 1544 he was no longer residing with Badile.<ref>Rearick, page 20, 1988.</ref> Although trained in the culture of [[Mannerism]] then popular in [[Parma]], he soon developed his own preference for a more radiant palette.<ref>Bussagli, Marco: \"The XVI Century\", ''Italian Art'', page 206. Giunti Gruppo Editoriale, 2000.</ref>\n\nIn his late teens he painted works for important churches in Verona, and in 1551 he was commissioned by the Venetian branch of the important [[Giustiniani]] family to paint the altarpiece for their chapel in the church of [[San Francesco della Vigna]], which was then being entirely rebuilt to the design of [[Jacopo Sansovino]].  In the same year he worked on the decoration of the Villa Soranzo near [[Treviso]], with his fellow Veronese [[Giovanni Battista Zelotti]] and [[Anselmo Canneri]]; only fragments of the frescos remain, but they seem to have been important in establishing his reputation.  The description by [[Carlo Ridolfi]] nearly a century later mentions that one of the mythological subjects was ''The Family of Darius before Alexander'', the rare subject in Veronese's grandest treatment of secular history, now in the [[National Gallery, London]].<ref>Penny, 331, 379</ref>\n\nIn 1552 Cardinal [[Ercole Gonzaga]], great-uncle of the ruling [[Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]], commissioned an altarpiece for [[Mantua Cathedral]] (now [[Caen]], France), which Veronese painted ''in situ''. He doubtless used his time in [[Mantua]] to study the ceilings by [[Giulio Romano]]; it was a painter of ceiling frescos that he would initially make his mark in Venice, where he based himself permanently from the following year.<ref>Penny, 331; Freedberg, 551 and ''passim'' in the following pages on the influence of Romano.</ref>\n\n===Venice===\n[[File:Paolo Veronese - St Mark - WGA24798.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''St Mark'', [[San Sebastiano, Venice|San Sebastiano]] (1556\u201357)]]\n[[File:Palazzetto del Veronese (Venice).jpg|thumb|House of Veronese in Venice]]\nVeronese moved to Venice in 1553 after obtaining his first state commission, ceilings in fresco decorating the ''Sala dei Consiglio dei Dieci'' (the Hall of the [[Council of Ten]]) and the adjoining ''Sala dei Tre Capi del Consiglio'' in the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]], in the new rooms replacing those lost in the fire of 1547.  His panel of ''Jupiter Expelling the Vices'' for the former is now in the [[Louvre]].  He then painted a ''History of Esther'' in the ceiling for the church of [[San Sebastiano, Venice|San Sebastiano]] (1556\u201357). It was these ceiling paintings and those of 1557 in the [[Biblioteca Marciana|Marciana Library]] (for which he was awarded a prize judged by Titian and Sansovino) that established him as a master among his Venetian contemporaries.<ref>Penny, 331; Dunkerton, Jill, et al.: ''Durer to Veronese: Sixteenth-Century Painting in the National Gallery'', page 125. National Gallery Publications, 1999.</ref> Already these works indicate Veronese's mastery in reflecting both the subtle foreshortening of the figures of [[Correggio]] and the heroism of those by [[Michelangelo]].<ref>Rearick, page 50, 1998.</ref>\n\n===Villa Barbaro and refectory paintings===\nBy 1556 Veronese was commissioned to paint the first of his monumental banquet scenes, the ''Feast in the House of Simon'', which would not be concluded until 1570. Owing to its scattered composition and lack of focus, however, it was not his most successful refectory mural.<ref>Rearick, page 75, 1988.</ref> In the late 1550s, during a break in his work for San Sebastiano, Veronese decorated the [[Villa Barbaro]] in [[Maser, Italy|Maser]], a newly finished building by the architect [[Andrea Palladio]].

[[Louvre]] ]]\nThe ''Wedding at Cana'', painted in 1562\u20131563, was also collaboration with Palladio. It was commissioned by the Benedictine monks for the San Giorgio Maggiore Monastery, on a small island across from Saint Mark's, in Venice. The contract insisted on the huge size (to cover 66 square meters), and that the quality of pigment and colors should be of premium quality. For example, the contract specified that the blues should contain the precious mineral lapis-lazuli.(<ref>Louvre 1993</ref>) The contract also specified that the painting should include as many figures as possible. There are a number of portraits (including those of Titian and Tintoretto, as well as a self-portrait of Veronese) staged upon a canvas surface nearly ten meters wide. The scene, taken from the New Testament Book of John, II, 1\u201311, represents the first miracle performed by Jesus, the making of wine from water, at a marriage in Cana, Galilee. The foreground celebration, a frieze of figures painted in the most shimmering finery, is flanked by two sets of stairs leading back to a terrace, Roman colonnades, and a brilliant sky.<ref name=\"Rearick, page 10, 1998\"/>\n\nIn the refectory paintings, as in ''[[The Family of Darius before Alexander]]'' (1565\u20131570),<ref>{{cite web|author=United Kingdom |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:The_Family_of_Darius_before_Alexander_by_Paolo_Veronese_1570.jpg |title=File:The Family of Darius before Alexander by Paolo Veronese 1570.jpg \u2013 Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref>  Veronese arranged the architecture to run mostly parallel to the picture plane, accentuating the processional character of the composition. The artist's decorative genius was to recognize that dramatic perspectival effects would have been tiresome in a living room or chapel, and that the narrative of the picture could best be absorbed as a colorful diversion.<ref>Dunkerton, et al., page 111, 1999.</ref> These paintings offer little in the representation of emotion; rather, they illustrate the carefully composed movement of their subjects along a primarily horizontal axis. Most of all they are about the incandescence of light and color.<ref name=\"Rearick, page 13, 1988\">Rearick, page 13, 1988.</ref> The exaltation of such visual effects may have been a reflection of the artist's personal well-being, for in 1565 Veronese married Elena Badile, the daughter of his first master, and by whom he would eventually have a daughter and four sons.<ref name=\"Rearick, page 13, 1988\"/>\n\nAlso painted between 1565\u20131570 is his ''Madonna and Child with St. Elizabeth, the Infant St. John the Baptist, and St. Justina'' in the [[Timken Museum of Art]], San Diego. St. Justina, a patroness of Padua and Venice, is at the right with the Blessed Virgin Mother and the Christ child in the center. In contrast to Italian works of a century earlier the infant is rendered convincingly as an infant. What makes one stop and take notice in this painting is the infant's reaching out to St. Justina, since a baby of this age would normally limit his gaze to his mother. Completing the work is St. Elizabeth, the cousin of Mary and mother of St. John the Baptist, located on the left. The artist delicately balances the forms of the extended Holy Family and renders them using a superb balance of warm and cool colors.\n\n===''The Feast in the House of Levi''===\nIn 1573 Veronese completed the commission for ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'', a last-supper painting for the rear wall of the refectory at the [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice|Basilica di Santi Giovanni e Paolo]], Castello, Venice. Originally titled ''The Last Supper'', the painting was to replace a Titian painting burnt in a fire; Veronese's oversized (5.55m x 12.80m) replacement depicted a Last Supper banquet scene that included German soldiers, dwarves, and animals \u2014 the human and animal exotica usual to Veronese's representational narratives.<ref>Dunkerton, ''et al.'', p. 30, 1999.</ref> Artistically, ''The Feast in the House of Levi'' indicates Veronese's technical development in using intense and luminous colours for texture, attention to narrative coherence, the acute representation of human emotion, and the psychologically subtle interplay occurring among the characters who crowd the scene.<ref name=\"Rearick, p. 14, 1988\">Rearick, p. 14, 1988.</ref>\n\n[[Image:The Feast in the House of Levi (edited).jpg|thumb|right|600px|''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'' (1573) featured people and animals that the Inquisition perceived as heretical. The Inquisitors' [[The Reformation and Art#Art and the Counter-Reformation|investigation]] found no heresy, yet ordered Paolo Veronese to re-title the painting something other than ''The Last Supper'', the original title.]]\n\nGiven the subject of the painting, the biblical Last Supper, the [[Renaissance humanism|humanistic]] depictions of the characters lacked the piousness usual to [[Roman Catholic art]] depicting the Christ character and the events of his life; and the [[Inquisition]] readily noticed Veronese's irreligiosity. By the 1570s, the theology of the [[Counter-Reformation]] had given legal authority to Roman Catholic doctrine in Venice, which was a new, political development for an artist such as Veronese. Professionally, in the [[History of the Republic of Venice|Venetian republic]] of the Late\u2013Renaissance, for an artist, painting crowd scenes had acquired political ramifications regarding who and what appeared in a religious painting commissioned from him, regardless of the patron or patroness.\n\nA decade earlier, the Benedictine monks who commissioned ''[[The Wedding at Cana]]'' (1563) had directed Veronese, as an artist, to freely include as many human figures as would fit in the banquet scene. In contrast, a decade later, Veronese encountered legal, religious constraints that determined the suitability (theological, political, sociological) of who and what he depicted in a painting\u2014thus, on 18 July 1573, the Inquisition legally summoned Veronese before a tribunal, to explain the presence of what Church doctrine considered characters, animals, and indecorum extraneous to an image of the [[Last Supper|Last Supper of the Christ]].<ref>Rearick, p. 104, 1988.</ref>\n\nThe tribunal's interrogation of the painter Veronese was cautionary, rather than punitive; political, rather than judicial; nonetheless, Veronese explained to the Inquisitiors that \u201cwe painters take the same liberties as poets and madmen\u201d in telling a story. Although the Inquisition's tribunal ordered Veronese to repaint the last-supper scene, he opposed their remedy to his theological offences, yet was compelled to re-title the painting from the sacramental ''The Last Supper'' to ''The Feast in the House of Levi''.<ref>Rearick, p. 104 1988. [http://members.efn.org/~acd/Veronese.html Transcript of the hearing]</ref>  That an artist, such as Paolo Veronese, had successfully perdured against the Inquisition's implied accusation of [[heresy]], indicated he had the discreet political support of a [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] patron of the arts.<ref>Penny, p. 333</ref>\n\n==Assessment==\n[[File:Veronese-pers\u00e9e-rennes.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Perseus and Andromeda (Veronese)|Perseus and Andromeda]]'' (1576\u20131578)]]\nAn artist's biography of Paolo Veronese was included to the second edition of the ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' (1568), by [[Giorgio Vasari]], with an improved coverage of the painters of the [[Florentine School]].\n\nA fuller biography of Veronese had to await ''Le maraviglie dell\u2019 Arte ovvero, Le vite degli Illustri Pittori Veneti and dello Stato'' (1648), by [[Carlo Ridolfi]], a compilation of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian School]] painters. Ridolfi said that Veronese's painting of ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'' (1573) is \u201cby far, the most important source for our knowledge of his art,\u201d<ref name=\"Penny, 333\"/> because \u201cit gave rein to joy, made beauty majestic, made laughter, itself, more festive.\u201d<ref name=\"Rearick, page 14, 1988\">Rearick, page 14, 1988.</ref>\n\nMoreover, in ''Paintings in the Louvre'' (1987), [[Lawrence Gowing]]\u2019s modern assessment of Paolo Veronese\u2019s artistic achievement is that:\n\n<blockquote>The French had no doubts, as the critic [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]] wrote in 1860, that Veronese was the greatest colorist who ever lived\u2014greater than Titian, Rubens, or Rembrandt because he established the harmony of natural tones in place of the modelling in dark and light that remained the method of academic chiaroscuro. Delacroix wrote that Veronese made light without violent contrasts, \"which we are always told is impossible, and maintained the strength of hue in shadow\".</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>This innovation could not be better described. Veronese\u2019s bright outdoor harmonies enlightened and inspired the whole nineteenth century. He was the foundation of modern painting. But whether his style is in fact naturalistic, as the [[Impressionists]] thought, or a most subtle and beautiful imaginative invention must remain a question for each age to answer for itself.<ref>Gowing, Lawrence: ''Paintings in the Louvre'', page 262. Stewart, Tabori & Chang, 1987.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Working practices==\n\nIn addition to the ceiling creations and wall paintings, Veronese also produced altarpieces (''The Consecration of Saint Nicholas'', 1561\u201362, London's [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG26 |title=Paolo Veronese &#124; The Consecration of Saint Nicholas &#124; NG26 &#124; The National Gallery, London |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |accessdate=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322194344/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG26 |archivedate=2009-03-22 }}</ref>), paintings on mythological subjects (''Venus and Mars'', 1578, New York [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/iopr/ho_10.189.htm |title=Paolo Veronese (Paolo Caliari): Mars and Venus United by Love (10.189) &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2013-09-04 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref>), and portraits (''Portrait of a Lady'', 1555, [[Louvre]]).

Included with [[Titian]], a generation older, and [[Tintoretto]], a decade senior, Veronese is one of the \"great trio that dominated Venetian painting of the ''[[cinquecento]]''\" and the [[Late Renaissance]] in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Rosand, 107\">Rosand, 107</ref> Known as a supreme colorist, and after an early period with [[Mannerism]], Paolo Veronese developed a naturalist style of painting, influenced by Titian.<ref>Freedburg, 550\u2013551</ref>\n[[Image:Paolo Veronese - The Family of Darius before Alexander - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|400px|''[[The Family of Darius before Alexander]]'' (1565\u20131570). Oil on canvas, 236.2cm \u00d7 475.9 cm, [[National Gallery]], London.]]\n\nHis most famous works are elaborate narrative cycles, executed in a dramatic and colorful style, full of majestic architectural settings and glittering pageantry. His large paintings of biblical feasts, crowded with figures, painted for the refectories of monasteries in Venice and Verona are especially famous, and he was also the leading Venetian painter of ceilings. Most of these works remain ''in situ'', or at least in Venice, and his representation in most museums is mainly composed of smaller works such as portraits that do not always show him at his best or most typical.\n\nHe has always been appreciated for \"the chromatic brilliance of his palette, the splendor and sensibility of his brushwork, the aristocratic elegance of his figures, and the magnificence of his spectacle\", but his work has been felt \"not to permit expression of the profound, the human, or the sublime\", and of the \"great trio\" he has often been the least appreciated by modern criticism.<ref name=\"Rosand, 107\"/> Nonetheless, \"many of the greatest artists ... may be counted among his admirers, including [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]\".<ref name=\"Penny, 333\">Penny, 333</ref>\n\n==Life and work==\n[[File:Castelvecchio06q-Veronese.jpg|thumb|left|''Deposition of Christ'', c. 1547]]\n\n===Birth and names===\nVeronese took his usual name from his birthplace of [[Verona]], then the largest possession of Venice on the mainland. The census in Verona attests that Veronese was born sometime in 1528 to a stonecutter, or ''spezapreda'' in the [[Venetian language]], named Gabriele, and his wife Caterina. He was their fifth child.<ref>Pedrocco, Filippo: \"Veronese\", page 3. SCALA Group S.p.A., 1998.</ref> It was common for surnames to be taken from a father's profession, and thus Veronese was known as Paolo Spezapreda. He later changed his name to Paolo Caliari, because his mother was the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman called Antonio Caliari.<ref name=\"Penny, 331\">Penny, 331</ref>  His earliest known painting is signed \"P. Caliari F., \"the first known instance in which he used this surname\", and after using \"Paolo Veronese\" for several years in Venice, after about 1575 he resumed signing his paintings as \"Paolo Caliari\".<ref name=\"Penny, 331\"/>  He was often called \"Paolo Veronese\" before the last century to distinguish him from another painter from Verona, \"Alessandro Veronese\", now known as [[Alessandro Turchi]] (1578\u20131649).<ref>Penny, 333 Note 1</ref>\n\n===Youth===\n[[File:Paolo Veronese, The Conversion of Mary Magdalene.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Conversion of Mary Magdalene]]'', c. 1548]]\nBy 1541, Veronese was apprenticed with [[Antonio Badile]], who was later to become his father-in-law, and in 1544 was an apprentice of [[Giovanni Francesco Caroto]]; both were leading painters in Verona.<ref name=\"Penny, 331\"/>  An altarpiece painted by Badile in 1543 includes striking passages that were most likely the work of his fifteen-year-old apprentice; Veronese's precocious gifts soon surpassed the level of the workshop, and by 1544 he was no longer residing with Badile.<ref>Rearick, page 20, 1988.</ref> Although trained in the culture of [[Mannerism]] then popular in [[Parma]], he soon developed his own preference for a more radiant palette.<ref>Bussagli, Marco: \"The XVI Century\", ''Italian Art'', page 206. Giunti Gruppo Editoriale, 2000.</ref>\n\nIn his late teens he painted works for important churches in Verona, and in 1551 he was commissioned by the Venetian branch of the important [[Giustiniani]] family to paint the altarpiece for their chapel in the church of [[San Francesco della Vigna]], which was then being entirely rebuilt to the design of [[Jacopo Sansovino]].  In the same year he worked on the decoration of the Villa Soranzo near [[Treviso]], with his fellow Veronese [[Giovanni Battista Zelotti]] and [[Anselmo Canneri]]; only fragments of the frescos remain, but they seem to have been important in establishing his reputation.  The description by [[Carlo Ridolfi]] nearly a century later mentions that one of the mythological subjects was ''The Family of Darius before Alexander'', the rare subject in Veronese's grandest treatment of secular history, now in the [[National Gallery, London]].<ref>Penny, 331, 379</ref>\n\nIn 1552 Cardinal [[Ercole Gonzaga]], great-uncle of the ruling [[Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]], commissioned an altarpiece for [[Mantua Cathedral]] (now [[Caen]], France), which Veronese painted ''in situ''. He doubtless used his time in [[Mantua]] to study the ceilings by [[Giulio Romano]]; it was a painter of ceiling frescos that he would initially make his mark in Venice, where he based himself permanently from the following year.<ref>Penny, 331; Freedberg, 551 and ''passim'' in the following pages on the influence of Romano.</ref>\n\n===Venice===\n[[File:Paolo Veronese - St Mark - WGA24798.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''St Mark'', [[San Sebastiano, Venice|San Sebastiano]] (1556\u201357)]]\n[[File:Palazzetto del Veronese (Venice).jpg|thumb|House of Veronese in Venice]]\nVeronese moved to Venice in 1553 after obtaining his first state commission, ceilings in fresco decorating the ''Sala dei Consiglio dei Dieci'' (the Hall of the [[Council of Ten]]) and the adjoining ''Sala dei Tre Capi del Consiglio'' in the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]], in the new rooms replacing those lost in the fire of 1547.  His panel of ''Jupiter Expelling the Vices'' for the former is now in the [[Louvre]].  He then painted a ''History of Esther'' in the ceiling for the church of [[San Sebastiano, Venice|San Sebastiano]] (1556\u201357). It was these ceiling paintings and those of 1557 in the [[Biblioteca Marciana|Marciana Library]] (for which he was awarded a prize judged by Titian and Sansovino) that established him as a master among his Venetian contemporaries.<ref>Penny, 331; Dunkerton, Jill, et al.: ''Durer to Veronese: Sixteenth-Century Painting in the National Gallery'', page 125. National Gallery Publications, 1999.</ref> Already these works indicate Veronese's mastery in reflecting both the subtle foreshortening of the figures of [[Correggio]] and the heroism of those by [[Michelangelo]].<ref>Rearick, page 50, 1998.</ref>\n\n===Villa Barbaro and refectory paintings===\nBy 1556 Veronese was commissioned to paint the first of his monumental banquet scenes, the ''Feast in the House of Simon'', which would not be concluded until 1570. Owing to its scattered composition and lack of focus, however, it was not his most successful refectory mural.<ref>Rearick, page 75, 1988.</ref> In the late 1550s, during a break in his work for San Sebastiano, Veronese decorated the [[Villa Barbaro]] in [[Maser, Italy|Maser]], a newly finished building by the architect [[Andrea Palladio]]. The frescoes were designed to unite humanistic culture with Christian spirituality; wall paintings included portraits of the Barbaro family,<ref>The ''[[Portrait of Daniele Barbaro]]'', painted 1566\u201367, entered the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam in 1952. ''Veronese: Gods, Heroes and Allegories'', De Vecchi, Pierluigi, pages 104\u20135. Rizzoli, 2004.</ref> and the ceilings opened to blue skies and mythological figures. Veronese's decorations employed complex perspective and [[trompe l'oeil]], and resulted in a luminescent and inspired visual poetry.<ref name=\"Rearick, page 10, 1998\">Rearick, page 10, 1998.</ref> The encounter between architect and artist was a triumph.<ref>Bussagli, page 207, 2000.</ref>\n\n[[File:Paolo Veronese 008.jpg|thumb|380px|''[[The Wedding at Cana]]'', 1562\u20131563. [[Louvre]] ]]\nThe ''Wedding at Cana'', painted in 1562\u20131563, was also collaboration with Palladio. It was commissioned by the Benedictine monks for the San Giorgio Maggiore Monastery, on a small island across from Saint Mark's, in Venice. The contract insisted on the huge size (to cover 66 square meters), and that the quality of pigment and colors should be of premium quality. For example, the contract specified that the blues should contain the precious mineral lapis-lazuli.(<ref>Louvre 1993</ref>) The contract also specified that the painting should include as many figures as possible. There are a number of portraits (including those of Titian and Tintoretto, as well as a self-portrait of Veronese) staged upon a canvas surface nearly ten meters wide. The scene, taken from the New Testament Book of John, II, 1\u201311, represents the first miracle performed by Jesus, the making of wine from water, at a marriage in Cana, Galilee. The foreground celebration, a frieze of figures painted in the most shimmering finery, is flanked by two sets of stairs leading back to a terrace, Roman colonnades, and a brilliant sky.<ref name=\"Rearick, page 10, 1998\"/>\n\nIn the refectory paintings, as in ''[[The Family of Darius before Alexander]]'' (1565\u20131570),<ref>{{cite web|author=United Kingdom |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:The_Family_of_Darius_before_Alexander_by_Paolo_Veronese_1570.jpg |title=File:The Family of Darius before Alexander by Paolo Veronese 1570.jpg \u2013 Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref>  Veronese arranged the architecture to run mostly parallel to the picture plane, accentuating the processional character of the composition. The artist's decorative genius was to recognize that dramatic perspectival effects would have been tiresome in a living room or chapel, and that the narrative of the picture could best be absorbed as a colorful diversion.<ref>Dunkerton, et al., page 111, 1999.</ref> These paintings offer little in the representation of emotion; rather, they illustrate the carefully composed movement of their subjects along a primarily horizontal axis. Most of all they are about the incandescence of light and color.<ref name=\"Rearick, page 13, 1988\">Rearick, page 13, 1988.</ref> The exaltation of such visual effects may have been a reflection of the artist's personal well-being, for in 1565 Veronese married Elena Badile, the daughter of his first master, and by whom he would eventually have a daughter and four sons.<ref name=\"Rearick, page 13, 1988\"/>\n\nAlso painted between 1565\u20131570 is his ''Madonna and Child with St. Elizabeth, the Infant St. John the Baptist, and St. Justina'' in the [[Timken Museum of Art]], San Diego. St. Justina, a patroness of Padua and Venice, is at the right with the Blessed Virgin Mother and the Christ child in the center. In contrast to Italian works of a century earlier the infant is rendered convincingly as an infant. What makes one stop and take notice in this painting is the infant's reaching out to St. Justina, since a baby of this age would normally limit his gaze to his mother. Completing the work is St. Elizabeth, the cousin of Mary and mother of St. John the Baptist, located on the left. The artist delicately balances the forms of the extended Holy Family and renders them using a superb balance of warm and cool colors.\n\n===''The Feast in the House of Levi''===\nIn 1573 Veronese completed the commission for ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'', a last-supper painting for the rear wall of the refectory at the [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice|Basilica di Santi Giovanni e Paolo]], Castello, Venice. Originally titled ''The Last Supper'', the painting was to replace a Titian painting burnt in a fire; Veronese's oversized (5.55m x 12.80m) replacement depicted a Last Supper banquet scene that included German soldiers, dwarves, and animals \u2014 the human and animal exotica usual to Veronese's representational narratives.<ref>Dunkerton, ''et al.'', p. 30, 1999.</ref> Artistically, ''The Feast in the House of Levi'' indicates Veronese's technical development in using intense and luminous colours for texture, attention to narrative coherence, the acute representation of human emotion, and the psychologically subtle interplay occurring among the characters who crowd the scene.<ref name=\"Rearick, p. 14, 1988\">Rearick, p. 14, 1988.</ref>\n\n[[Image:The Feast in the House of Levi - Paolo Veronese Cena in Casa Levi - Olio su tela, Manierismo veneto, loggia, architettura rinascimentale palladiana-sanmichelina, notturno, ordine corinzio, notte (Light correction by Paolo Villa).jpg|thumb|right|600px|''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'' (1573) featured people and animals that the Inquisition perceived as heretical. The Inquisitors' [[The Reformation and Art#Art and the Counter-Reformation|investigation]] found no heresy, yet ordered Paolo Veronese to re-title the painting something other than ''The Last Supper'', the original title.]]\n\nGiven the subject of the painting, the biblical Last Supper, the [[Renaissance humanism|humanistic]] depictions of the characters lacked the piousness usual to [[Roman Catholic art]] depicting the Christ character and the events of his life; and the [[Inquisition]] readily noticed Veronese's irreligiosity. By the 1570s, the theology of the [[Counter-Reformation]] had given legal authority to Roman Catholic doctrine in Venice, which was a new, political development for an artist such as Veronese. Professionally, in the [[History of the Republic of Venice|Venetian republic]] of the Late\u2013Renaissance, for an artist, painting crowd scenes had acquired political ramifications regarding who and what appeared in a religious painting commissioned from him, regardless of the patron or patroness.\n\nA decade earlier, the Benedictine monks who commissioned ''[[The Wedding at Cana]]'' (1563) had directed Veronese, as an artist, to freely include as many human figures as would fit in the banquet scene. In contrast, a decade later, Veronese encountered legal, religious constraints that determined the suitability (theological, political, sociological) of who and what he depicted in a painting\u2014thus, on 18 July 1573, the Inquisition legally summoned Veronese before a tribunal, to explain the presence of what Church doctrine considered characters, animals, and indecorum extraneous to an image of the [[Last Supper|Last Supper of the Christ]].<ref>Rearick, p. 104, 1988.</ref>\n\nThe tribunal's interrogation of the painter Veronese was cautionary, rather than punitive; political, rather than judicial; nonetheless, Veronese explained to the Inquisitiors that \u201cwe painters take the same liberties as poets and madmen\u201d in telling a story. Although the Inquisition's tribunal ordered Veronese to repaint the last-supper scene, he opposed their remedy to his theological offences, yet was compelled to re-title the painting from the sacramental ''The Last Supper'' to ''The Feast in the House of Levi''.<ref>Rearick, p. 104 1988. [http://members.efn.org/~acd/Veronese.html Transcript of the hearing]</ref>  That an artist, such as Paolo Veronese, had successfully perdured against the Inquisition's implied accusation of [[heresy]], indicated he had the discreet political support of a [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] patron of the arts.<ref>Penny, p. 333</ref>\n\n==Assessment==\n[[File:Veronese-pers\u00e9e-rennes.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Perseus and Andromeda (Veronese)|Perseus and Andromeda]]'' (1576\u20131578)]]\nAn artist's biography of Paolo Veronese was included to the second edition of the ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' (1568), by [[Giorgio Vasari]], with an improved coverage of the painters of the [[Florentine School]].\n\nA fuller biography of Veronese had to await ''Le maraviglie dell\u2019 Arte ovvero, Le vite degli Illustri Pittori Veneti and dello Stato'' (1648), by [[Carlo Ridolfi]], a compilation of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian School]] painters. Ridolfi said that Veronese's painting of ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'' (1573) is \u201cby far, the most important source for our knowledge of his art,\u201d<ref name=\"Penny, 333\"/> because \u201cit gave rein to joy, made beauty majestic, made laughter, itself, more festive.\u201d<ref name=\"Rearick, page 14, 1988\">Rearick, page 14, 1988.</ref>\n\nMoreover, in ''Paintings in the Louvre'' (1987), [[Lawrence Gowing]]\u2019s modern assessment of Paolo Veronese\u2019s artistic achievement is that:\n\n<blockquote>The French had no doubts, as the critic [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]] wrote in 1860, that Veronese was the greatest colorist who ever lived\u2014greater than Titian, Rubens, or Rembrandt because he established the harmony of natural tones in place of the modelling in dark and light that remained the method of academic chiaroscuro. Delacroix wrote that Veronese made light without violent contrasts, \"which we are always told is impossible, and maintained the strength of hue in shadow\".</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>This innovation could not be better described. Veronese\u2019s bright outdoor harmonies enlightened and inspired the whole nineteenth century. He was the foundation of modern painting. But whether his style is in fact naturalistic, as the [[Impressionists]] thought, or a most subtle and beautiful imaginative invention must remain a question for each age to answer for itself.<ref>Gowing, Lawrence: ''Paintings in the Louvre'', page 262. Stewart, Tabori & Chang, 1987.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Working practices==\n\nIn addition to the ceiling creations and wall paintings, Veronese also produced altarpieces (''The Consecration of Saint Nicholas'', 1561\u201362, London's [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG26 |title=Paolo Veronese &#124; The Consecration of Saint Nicholas &#124; NG26 &#124; The National Gallery, London |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |accessdate=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322194344/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG26 |archivedate=2009-03-22 }}</ref>), paintings on mythological subjects (''Venus and Mars'', 1578, New York [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/iopr/ho_10.189.htm |title=Paolo Veronese (Paolo Caliari): Mars and Venus United by Love (10.189) &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2013-09-04 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref>), and portraits (''Portrait of a Lady'', 1555, [[Louvre]]).

This bridge provided a daily crossing for the residents along the margins of the Vale de Navarro, which is known for having many vestiges from antiquity.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nDuring the reign of [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]], the municipal seat of Moura was conquered from the Moors, and a feudal seigneurial system was imposed in the region. Sancho relinquished the village to the [[Knights Hospitaller]], who left their marks in the region of Amareleja  (including erecting their cross in some sites). Some of the early buildings were influenced by the Order and other high nobles, who sent their shepherds and herds to graze in this part of the Kingdom.<ref name=JFHistoria/> Over time a small agglomeration began to form in the area called ''Montinha'', in the place that was later known as ''aldeia velha'' (''old farm'').<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nBy November 1481, in the ''Cortes'' of the city of [[\u00c9vora]], the representatives of the people determined the need to create chapels and hospitals in various [[comarca]]s of the Kingdom. It was during this meeting that Mareleja began to receive religious attention, but few formal records after 1527 identify what became of these deliberations: it was referenced during King [[John III of Portugal|John III]]'s census (1527), identifying a small agglomeration of 55 dwellings.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nBy the end of the 15th century the religious needs of these people led to the construction on Montinha of the ''Igrejinha de Santo Ant\u00f3nio'' (in honour of Saint [[Anthony of Padua]], who was considered the [[patron saint]] of cattle). By this time the village had already existed for approximately 500 year.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n \nParish records first identified the location as Amareleja in 1534. Until the present, there has been no firm explanation as to the name of this parish. On 10 April 1677, the parish priest, who published a book referring to the parish of ''Nossa Senhora de Concepsao de Marileiga''.<ref name=JFHistoria/> A similar document, dated 1 April 1695, also confirmed this designation and suggest a corruption of the original ''Marileiga''.

Sancho relinquished the village to the [[Knights Hospitaller]], who left their marks in the region of Amareleja  (including erecting their cross in some sites). Some of the early buildings were influenced by the Order and other high nobles, who sent their shepherds and herds to graze in this part of the Kingdom.<ref name=JFHistoria/> Over time a small agglomeration began to form in the area called ''Montinha'', in the place that was later known as ''aldeia velha'' (''old farm'').<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nBy November 1481, in the ''Cortes'' of the city of [[\u00c9vora]], the representatives of the people determined the need to create chapels and hospitals in various [[comarca]]s of the Kingdom. It was during this meeting that Mareleja began to receive religious attention, but few formal records after 1527 identify what became of these deliberations: it was referenced during King [[John III of Portugal|John III]]'s census (1527), identifying a small agglomeration of 55 dwellings.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nBy the end of the 15th century the religious needs of these people led to the construction on Montinha of the ''Igrejinha de Santo Ant\u00f3nio'' (in honour of Saint [[Anthony of Padua]], who was considered the [[patron saint]] of cattle). By this time the village had already existed for approximately 500 year.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n \nParish records first identified the location as Amareleja in 1534. Until the present, there has been no firm explanation as to the name of this parish. On 10 April 1677, the parish priest, who published a book referring to the parish of ''Nossa Senhora de Concepsao de Marileiga''.<ref name=JFHistoria/> A similar document, dated 1 April 1695, also confirmed this designation and suggest a corruption of the original ''Marileiga''.
