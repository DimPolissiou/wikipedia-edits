Since then, the Bible has been translated into [[Bible translations by language|many more languages]].\n\n[[English Bible translations]] also have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium. (See also [[List of English Bible translations]].)\n\n==Original text==\n===Hebrew Bible===\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] was mainly written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with some portions (notably in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]]) in [[Biblical Aramaic]]. From the 6th century to the 10th century CE, Jewish scholars, today known as [[Masoretes]], compared the text of all known [[biblical manuscript]]s in an effort to create a unified, standardized text. A series of highly similar texts eventually emerged, and any of these texts are known as [[Masoretic Texts]] (MT). The Masoretes also added vowel points (called [[niqqud]]) to the text, since the original text contained [[Abjad|only consonants]]. This sometimes required the selection of an interpretation; since some words differ only in their vowels their meaning can vary in accordance with the vowels chosen. In antiquity, variant Hebrew readings existed, some of which have survived in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] and other ancient fragments, as well as being attested in ancient versions in other languages.<ref name=\"Cohen1979\">Menachem Cohen, [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/CohenArt/ The Idea of the Sanctity of the Biblical Text and the Science of Textual Criticism] in ''HaMikrah V'anachnu'', ed.

Revised by Gordon M. Messing. {{ISBN|9780674362505}}. Harvard University Press, 1956. Introduction F, N-2, p. 4A</ref> The ''autographs'', the Greek [[biblical manuscript|manuscripts]] written by the original authors, have not survived. Scholars surmise the original Greek text from the manuscripts that do survive. The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the [[Alexandrian text-type]], the [[Byzantine text-type]], and the [[Western text-type]].\n\nMost variants among the manuscripts are minor, such as alternative spelling, alternative word order, the presence or absence of an optional definite article (\"the\"), and so on. Occasionally, a major variant happens when a portion of a text was missing or for other reasons. Examples of major variants are the [[Mark 16|endings of Mark]], the [[Pericope Adulter\u00e6]], the [[Comma Johanneum]], and the [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Western version of Acts]].\n\nThe discovery of older manuscripts which belong to the Alexandrian text-type, including the 4th-century [[Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]], led scholars to revise their view about the original Greek text. [[Karl Lachmann]] based his [[Textual criticism|critical edition]] of 1831 on manuscripts dating from the 4th century and earlier, to argue that the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' must be corrected according to these earlier texts.\n\nEarly manuscripts of the [[Pauline epistles]] and other New Testament writings show [[Greek orthography|no punctuation]] whatsoever.<ref>http://greek-language.com/grklinguist/?p=657.</ref><ref>http://www.stpaulsirvine.org/images/papyruslg.gif| shows an example of the text without punctuation</ref> The [[punctuation]] was added later by other editors, according to their own understanding of the text.\n\n==History==\n=== Ancient translations ===\n\n\n====Aramaic Targums====\n{{main article|Targum}}\nSome of the first translations of the [[Torah]] began during the [[Babylonian exile]], when [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] became the [[lingua franca]] of the Jews. With most people speaking only Aramaic and not understanding Hebrew, the [[Targum]]s were created to allow the common person to understand the Torah as it was read in ancient [[synagogue]]s.\n\n====Greek Septuagint====\n{{main article|Septuagint}}\nBy the 3rd century BC, [[Alexandria]] had become the center of [[Hellenistic Judaism]], and during the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC translators compiled in Egypt a [[Koine Greek]] version of the Hebrew scriptures in several stages (completing the task by 132 BC). The [[Talmud]] ascribes the translation effort to [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] ([[r.]] 285\u2013246 BC), who allegedly hired 72 Jewish scholars for the purpose, for which reason the translation is commonly known as the Septuagint (from the Latin ''septuaginta'', \"seventy\"), a name which it gained in \"the time of [[Augustine of Hippo]]\" (354\u2013430 AD).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Sundberg | first = Albert C., Jr. | editor = McDonald, Lee Martin |editor2=Sanders, James A. | encyclopedia = The Canon Debate | title = The Septuagint: The Bible of Hellenistic Judaism | year = 2002 | publisher = Hendrickson Publishers | isbn = 978-1-56563-517-3 | pages = 72 }}</ref><ref>''The Canon Debate'', McDonald & Sanders editors, chapter by Sundberg, page 72, adds further detail: \"However, it was not until the time of [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430 CE) that the Greek translation of the Jewish scriptures came to be called by the Latin term ''septuaginta''. [70 rather than 72]\n\nJerome began by revising the earlier Latin translations, but ended by going back to the original Greek, bypassing all translations, and going back to the original Hebrew wherever he could instead of the Septuagint.\nThe New Testament and at least some of the Old Testament was translated into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] in the 4th century by [[Ulfilas]]. In the 5th century, [[Saint Mesrob]] translated the Bible into [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Also dating from the same period are the [[Peshitta|Syriac]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] translations.\n\nIn his ''City of God'' 18.42, while repeating the [[Letter of Aristeas|story of Aristeas]] with typical embellishments, Augustine adds the remark, \"It is their translation that it has now become traditional to call the Septuagint\" ...[Latin omitted]... Augustine thus indicates that this name for the Greek translation of the scriptures was a recent development. But he offers no clue as to which of the possible antecedents led to this development: {{bibleverse||Exod|24:1-8}}, [[Josephus]] [Antiquities 12.57, 12.86], or an elision. ...this name ''Septuagint'' appears to have been a fourth- to fifth-century development.\"</ref> The Septuagint (LXX), the very first translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into [[Greek language|Greek]], later became the accepted text of the [[Old Testament]] in the Christian church and the basis of its [[Biblical canon|canon]]. [[Jerome]] based his Latin [[Vulgate]] translation on the Hebrew for those books of the Bible preserved in the Jewish canon (as reflected in the [[Masoretic text]]), and on the Greek text for the [[deuterocanonical books]].\n\nThe translation now known as the Septuagint was widely used by Greek-speaking Jews, and later by Christians.<ref name=\"Jobes and Silva\">Karen Jobes and Moises Silva, ''Invitation to the Septuagint'', {{ISBN|1-84227-061-3}} (Paternoster Press, 2001). - The {{as of | 2001 | lc = on}} standard introductory work on the Septuagint.</ref> It differs somewhat from the later standardized Hebrew ([[Masoretic Text]]). This translation was promoted{{by whom|date=March 2016}} by way of a legend (primarily recorded as the [[Letter of Aristeas]]) that seventy (or in some sources, seventy-two) separate translators all produced identical texts; supposedly proving its accuracy.<ref name=\"Dines\">\nJennifer M.

Knibb, Ed., London: T&T Clark, 2004.\n</ref>\n\nVersions of the Septuagint contain several passages and whole books not included in the Masoretic texts of the [[Tanakh]]. In some cases these additions were originally composed in Greek, while in other cases they are translations of Hebrew books or of Hebrew variants not present in the Masoretic texts. Recent discoveries have shown that more of the Septuagint additions have a Hebrew origin than previously thought. While there are no complete surviving manuscripts of the Hebrew texts on which the Septuagint was based, many{{quantify|date=March 2016}} scholars believe that they represent a different textual tradition (\"[[Vorlage]]\") from the one that became the basis for the Masoretic texts.<ref name=\"Cohen1979\">Menachem Cohen, [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/CohenArt/ The Idea of the Sanctity of the Biblical Text and the Science of Textual Criticism] in ''HaMikrah V'anachnu'', ed.

In addition, he included three anonymous translations of the Psalms (the ''Quinta'', ''Sexta'' and ''Septima''). His eclectic recension of the Septuagint had a significant influence on the Old Testament text in several important manuscripts. The canonical [[Christian Bible]] was formally established by Bishop [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] in 350 (although it had been generally accepted by the church previously), confirmed by the [[Council of Laodicea]] in 363 (both lacked the book of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]), and later established by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] in 367 (with [[Revelation]] added), and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Vulgate]]'' Latin translation dates to between AD 382 and 405. [[Latin]] translations predating Jerome are collectively known as ''[[Vetus Latina]]'' texts.\n\nChristian translations also tend to be based upon the Hebrew, though some denominations prefer the Septuagint (or may cite variant readings from both). Bible translations incorporating modern textual criticism usually begin with the masoretic text, but also take into account possible variants from all available ancient versions. The [[Textus Receptus|received text]] of the Christian [[New Testament]] is in [[Koine Greek]],{{efn|Some scholars hypothesize that certain books (whether completely or partially) may have been written in Aramaic before being translated for widespread dissemination. One very famous example of this is [[Logos|the opening]] to the [[Gospel of John]], which some scholars argue to be a Greek translation of an Aramaic hymn.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}}} and nearly all translations are based upon the Greek text.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nJerome began by revising the earlier Latin translations, but ended by going back to the original Greek, bypassing all translations, and going back to the original Hebrew wherever he could instead of the Septuagint.\n\nThe Bible [[Gothic Bible|was translated]] into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] in the 4th century by a group of scholars, possibly under the supervision of [[Ulfilas]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Falluomini|first1=Carla|title=The Gothic Version of the Gospels and Pauline Epistles: Cultural background, transmission and character|date=2015|publisher=De Gruyter|location=Berlin|doi=10.1515/9783110334692|isbn=9783110334692}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ratkus|first1=Art\u016bras|title=Greek \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 in Gothic translation: Linguistics and theology at a crossroads|journal=NOWELE|date=2018|volume=71|issue=1|page=3\u201334|doi=10.1075/nowele.00002.rat|url=https://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/nowele.00002.rat/details}}</ref> In the 5th century, [[Saint Mesrob]] translated the Bible using the [[Armenian alphabet]] invented by him.

[[Athanasius]] (''Apol. Const. 4'') recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for [[Constans]]. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for [[Biblical canon|canon lists]], and that [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Alexandrinus]] are examples of these Bibles. Together with the [[Peshitta]], these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.<ref>''The Canon Debate'', McDonald & Sanders editors, 2002, pp. 414-415, for the entire paragraph.</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{Main article|Bible translations in the Middle Ages}}\n[[File:Devil codex Gigas.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Codex Gigas]] from the 13th century, held at the [[Swedish Royal Library|Royal Library]] in [[Sweden]].]]\nWhen ancient scribes copied earlier books, they wrote notes on the margins of the page (''marginal [[Biblical gloss|glosses]]'') to correct their text\u2014especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line\u2014and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text. See [[textual criticism]]. Over time, different regions evolved different versions, each with its own assemblage of omissions, additions, and variants (mostly in [[orthography]]).\n\nThe earliest surviving complete manuscript of the entire Bible in Latin is the [[Codex Amiatinus]], a Latin Vulgate edition produced in 8th-century England at the double monastery of [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey|Wearmouth-Jarrow]].\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], translation, particularly of the Old Testament was discouraged. Nevertheless, there are some fragmentary [[Old English Bible translations]], notably a lost translation of the [[Gospel of John]] into Old English by the Venerable [[Bede]], which is said to have been prepared shortly before his death around the year 735. An [[Old High German]] version of the gospel of Matthew dates to 748. [[Charlemagne]] in ca. 800 charged [[Alcuin]] with a revision of the Latin Vulgate. The translation into [[Old Church Slavonic]] was started in 863 by [[Cyril and Methodius]].\n\n[[Alfred the Great]] had a number of passages of the Bible circulated in the vernacular in around 900. These included passages from the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Pentateuch]], which he prefixed to a code of laws he promulgated around this time. In approximately 990, a full and freestanding version of the four Gospels in idiomatic Old English appeared, in the [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] dialect; these are called the ''[[Wessex Gospels]]''. Around the same time, a compilation now called the ''[[Old English Hexateuch]]'' appeared with the first six (or, in one version, seven) books of the Old Testament.\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]] in 1199 [[censorship of the Bible|banned]] unauthorized versions of the Bible as a reaction to the [[Cathar]] and [[Waldensian]] heresies. The [[Council of Toulouse|synods of Toulouse]] and Tarragona (1234) outlawed possession of such renderings. There is evidence of some vernacular translations being permitted while others were being scrutinized.\n\nThe complete Bible was translated into Old French in the late 13th century. Parts of this translation were included in editions of the popular ''Bible historiale'', and there is no evidence of this translation being suppressed by the Church.<ref>Sneddon, Clive R. 1993. \"A neglected mediaeval Bible translation.\" ''Romance Languages Annual'' 5(1): 11-16 [http://tell.fll.purdue.edu/RLA-Archive/1993/French-html/Sneddon,Clive.htm].</ref> The entire Bible was translated into Czech around 1360.\n\nThe most notable [[Middle English Bible translation]], [[Wycliffe's Bible]] (1383), based on the Vulgate, was banned by the Oxford Synod in 1408. A Hungarian [[Hussite]] Bible appeared in the mid 15th century, and in 1478, a Catalan translation in the dialect of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]].  Many parts of the Bible were printed by [[William Caxton]] in his translation of the [[Golden Legend]], and in ''Speculum Vitae Christi'' (''[[The Mirror of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ]]'').\n\n===Reformation and Early Modern period===\n{{See also|Early Modern English Bible translations}}\n[[File:Bible Kralicka.JPG|thumb|250px|Czech Protestant [[Bible of Kralice]] (1593)]]\nThe earliest printed edition of the Greek New Testament appeared in 1516 from the [[Johann Froben|Froben]] press, by [[Erasmus|Desiderius Erasmus]], who reconstructed its Greek text from several recent manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type. He occasionally added a Greek translation of the Latin Vulgate for parts that did not exist in the Greek manuscripts. He produced four later editions of this text. Erasmus was Roman Catholic, but his preference for the [[Byzantine Greek]] manuscripts rather than the [[Latin Vulgate]] led some church authorities to view him with suspicion.\n\nDuring 1517 and 1519 [[Francysk Skaryna]] printed a translation of the Bible in [[Old Belarusian language]] in twenty-two books.<ref>\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u044f (\u0414\u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a \u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430) \u0421\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044b, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0423\u043b\u044f\u0445\u0438\u043d, \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0446\u043a, 1994</ref>\n\nIn 1521, [[Martin Luther]] was placed under the [[Imperial ban|Ban of the Empire]], and he retired to the [[Wartburg Castle]]. During his time there, he translated the New Testament from Greek into German. It was printed in September 1522. The first complete Dutch Bible, partly based on the existing portions of Luther's translation, was printed in [[Antwerp]] in 1526 by [[Jacob van Liesvelt]].<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, p. 120.</ref>\n\nThe first printed edition with ''[[critical apparatus]]'' (noting variant readings among the manuscripts) was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for \"received text\"), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' (\"now received by all\").\n\nThe use of numbered chapters and verses was not introduced until the Middle Ages and later. The system used in English was developed by Stephanus ([[Robert Estienne]] of Paris) (see [[Chapters and verses of the Bible]])\n\nLater critical editions incorporate ongoing scholarly research, including discoveries of Greek papyrus fragments from near Alexandria, Egypt, that date in some cases within a few decades of the original New Testament writings.<ref>Metzger, Bruce R. ''Manuscripts of the Greek Bible: An Introduction to Paleography'' (Oxford University Press, 1981) cf. [[Papyrus 52]].</ref> Today, most critical editions of the Greek New Testament, such as UBS4 and [[NA27]], consider the Alexandrian text-type corrected by papyri, to be the Greek text that is closest to the original ''autographs''. Their ''apparatus'' includes the result of votes among scholars, ranging from certain {A} to doubtful {E}, on which variants best preserve the original Greek text of the New Testament.\n\nCritical editions that rely primarily on the Alexandrian text-type inform nearly all modern translations (and revisions of older translations). For reasons of tradition, however, some translators prefer to use the Textus Receptus for the Greek text, or use the ''[[Majority Text]]'' which is similar to it but is a critical edition that relies on earlier manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type. Among these, some argue that the Byzantine tradition contains scribal additions, but these later interpolations preserve the orthodox interpretations of the biblical text\u2014as part of the ongoing Christian experience\u2014and in this sense are authoritative. Distrust of the textual basis of modern translations has contributed to the [[King-James-Only Movement]].\n\nThe churches of the [[Protestant Reformation]] translated the Greek of the Textus Receptus to produce [[vernacular]] Bibles, such as the German [[Luther Bible]] (1522), the Polish [[Brest Bible]] (1563), the Spanish \"Biblia del Oso\" (in English: Bible of the Bear, 1569) which later became the [[Reina-Valera]] Bible upon its first revision in 1602, the Czech [[Melantrich Bible]] (1549) and [[Bible of Kralice]] (1579-1593) and numerous English translations of the Bible. [[William Tyndale|Tyndale's]] [[Tyndale's Bible|New Testament translation]] (1526, revised in 1534, 1535 and 1536) and his translation of the [[Pentateuch]] (1530, 1534) and the [[Book of Jonah]] were met with heavy sanctions given the widespread belief that Tyndale ''changed'' the Bible as he attempted to translate it. Tyndale's unfinished work, cut short by his execution, was supplemented by [[Myles Coverdale]] and published under a pseudonym to create the [[Matthew Bible]], the first complete English translation of the Bible. Attempts at an \"authoritative\" English Bible for the [[Church of England]] would include the [[Great Bible]] of 1538 (also relying on Coverdale's work), the [[Bishops' Bible]] of 1568, and the Authorized Version (the [[King James Version]]) of 1611, the last of which would become a standard for English speaking Christians for several centuries.\n\nThe first complete French Bible was a translation by [[Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples]], published in 1530 in [[Antwerp]].<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, pp. 134-135.</ref> The [[Froschauer Bible]] of 1531 and the [[Luther Bible]] of 1534 (both appearing in portions throughout the 1520s) were an important part of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].\n\nThe first English translations of [[Psalms]] (1530), [[Isaiah]] (1531), [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (1533), [[Ecclesiastes]] (1533), [[Jeremiah]] (1534) and [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] (1534), were executed by the Protestant Bible translator [[George Joye]] in [[Antwerp]]. In 1535 Myles Coverdale published the first complete [[Coverdale Bible|English Bible]] also in [[Antwerp]].<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, pp. 143-145.</ref>\n\nBy 1578 both Old and New Testaments were translated to [[Slovene language|Slovene]] by the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writer and theologian [[Jurij Dalmatin]]. The work was not printed until 1583. The [[Slovenes]] thus became the 12th nation in the world with a complete Bible in their language. The translation of the New Testament was based on the work by Dalmatin's mentor, the Protestant [[Primo\u017e Trubar]], who published the translation of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] already in 1555 and the entire testament by parts until 1577.\n\nFollowing the distribution of a Welsh New Testament and Prayer Book to every parish Church in Wales in 1567, translated by [[William Salesbury]], Welsh became the 13th language into which the whole Bible had been translated in 1588, through a translation by William Morgan, the bishop of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant.<ref>J.

It was realised that, at the rates of Bible translation at that point, it would take until at least 2150 until Bible translation began in every language that was needing a translation. Since the launch of Vision 2025, Bible translation efforts have increased dramatically, in large part due to the technology that is now available. Due to the increase, at current rates, Bible translation will begin in every language by 2038, thus being 112 years faster.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Creson |first1=Bob |title=Bible Translation as We Approach 2025 What's Been Accomplished and What Remains |url=https://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/bible-translation-as-we-approach-2025 |website=Mission Frontiers |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs of October 2019, they estimated that around 171 million people, speak those 2,115 languages where translation work still needs to begin.

Inside the Bible-translation community, these are commonly categorized as:\n* [[Dynamic equivalence]] translation\n* [[Formal equivalence]] translation (similar to [[literal translation]])\n* [[Idiomatic]], or [[Paraphrase|paraphrastic]] translation, as used by the late [[Kenneth N. Taylor]]\n\nthough modern linguists, such as Bible scholar Dr. Joel Hoffman, disagree with this classification.<ref>[http://goddidntsaythat.com/2009/10/05/formal-equivalence-and-dynamic-equivalence-a-false-dichotom/ \"Formal Equivalence and Dynamic Equivalence: A False Dichotomy\"]</ref>\n\nAs [[Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]], the original languages of the Bible, like all languages, have some [[idiom]]s and concepts [[Untranslatability|not easily translated]], there is in some cases an ongoing critical tension about whether it is better to give a word for word translation or to give a translation that gives a parallel idiom in the target language. For instance, in the [[Douay Rheims Bible]], [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition]], [[New American Bible Revised Edition]], which are the English language [[Catholic]] translations, as well as [[Protestant]] translations like the [[King James Bible]], the [[Darby Bible]], the [[Recovery Version]], the [[New Revised Standard Version]], the [[Modern Literal Version]], and the [[New American Standard Bible]] are seen as more literal translations (or \"word for word\"), whereas translations like the [[New International Version]] and [[New Living Translation]] sometimes attempt to give relevant parallel idioms. [[The Living Bible]] and [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]] are two paraphrases of the Bible that try to convey the original meaning in contemporary language. The further away one gets from word for word translation, the easier the text becomes to read while relying more on the theological, linguistic or cultural understanding of the translator, which one would not normally expect a lay reader to require. On the other hand, as one gets closer to a word for word translation, the text becomes more literal but still relies on similar problems of meaningful translation at the word level and makes it difficult for lay readers to interpret due to their unfamiliarity with ancient idioms and other historical and cultural contexts.\n\n===Doctrinal differences and translation policy===\n {{Further|Tetragrammaton in the New Testament}}\nIn addition to linguistic concerns, theological issues also drive Bible translations. Some translations of the Bible, produced by single churches or groups of churches, may be seen as subject to a point of view by the translation committee.\n\nFor example, the [[New World Translation]], produced by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], provides different renderings where verses in other Bible translations support the deity of Christ.<ref>http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/new-world-translation-accurate/#?insight[search_id]=ab273185-8135-4ee9-a212-210cef439f3e&insight[search_result_index]=0</ref> The NWT also translates ''kurios'' as \"[[Jehovah]]\" rather than \"Lord\" when quoting Hebrew passages that used YHWH. The authors believe that Jesus would have used God's name and not the customary ''kurios''. On this basis, the anonymous New World Bible Translation Committee inserted ''Jehovah'' into the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures (New Testament) a total of 237 times while the New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) uses Jehovah a total of 6,979 times to a grand total of 7,216 in the entire 2013 Revision New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures while previous revisions such as the 1984 revision were a total of 7,210 times while the 1961 revision were a total of 7,199 times.<ref>''New World Translation'' appendix, pp. 1564-1566. When discussing \u201cRestoring the Divine Name,\u201d the New World Bible Translation Committee states: \u201cTo know where the divine name was replaced by the Greek words \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, we have determined where the inspired Christian writers have quoted verses, passages and expressions from the Hebrew Scriptures and then we have referred back to the Hebrew text to ascertain whether the divine name appears there. In this way we determined the identity to give Ky\u02b9ri\u00b7os and The\u00b7os\u02b9 and the personality with which to clothe them.\u201d Explaining further, the Committee said: \u201cTo avoid overstepping the bounds of a translator into the field of exegesis, we have been most cautious about rendering the divine name in the Christian Greek Scriptures, always carefully considering the Hebrew Scriptures as a background. We have looked for agreement from the Hebrew versions to confirm our rendering.\u201d Such agreement from Hebrew versions exists in all the 237 places that the New World Bible Translation Committee has rendered the divine name in the body of its translation.\u2014NW appendix, pp. 1564-1566</ref>\n\nA number of [[Sacred Name Bibles]] (e.g., the [[Sacred Scriptures Bethel Edition]]) have been published that are even more rigorous in transliterating the tetragrammaton using Semitic forms to translate it in the Old Testament and also using the same Semitic forms to translate the Greek word ''Theos'' (God) in the New Testament\u2014usually Yahweh, Elohim or some other variation.\n\nOther translations are distinguished by smaller but distinctive doctrinal differences. For example, the [[Purified Translation of the Bible]], by translation and explanatory footnotes, promoting the position that Christians should not drink alcohol, that New Testament references to \"wine\" are translated as \"grape juice\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n; Ancient and classical translations&#x3a;\n* [[Coptic versions of the Bible]]\n* [[Syriac versions of the Bible]]\n* [[Targum]] and [[Peshitta]] (Aramaic)\n* [[Vetus Latina]] and [[Vulgate]] (Latin)\n\n;English translations&#x3a;\n* [[Early Modern English Bible translations]]\n* [[English translations of the Bible]]\n* [[Jewish English Bible translations]]\n* [[Old English Bible translations]]\n* [[Middle English Bible translations]]\n* [[Modern English Bible translations]]\n\n; Other languages&#x3a;\n* [[Bible translations by language]]\n* [[Naro Bible]]\n* [[Bible translations into Ladakhi]]\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of Africa]]\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of India]]\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of Indonesia]]\n\n;Difficulties&#x3a;\n* [[Gender in Bible translation]]\n* [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy#Translation and interpretation]]\n* [[Translation#Fidelity and transparency]]\n\n;Others&#x3a;\n* [[Bibledit]]\n* [[Bible version debate]]\n* [[Byzantine text-type]]\n* [[Bible concordance]]\n* [[Exegesis]]\n* [[Hermeneutics]]\n* [[Institute for Bible Translation]]\n* [[List of languages by year of first Bible translation]]\n* [[Skopos theory]]\n* [[Textus Receptus]]\n* [[Translation]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Garry Wills|Wills, Garry]], \"A Wild and Indecent Book\" (review of [[David Bentley Hart]], ''The New Testament:  A Translation'', [[Yale University Press]], 577 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

Since then, the Bible has been translated into [[Bible translations by language|many more languages]].  [[English Bible translations]] also have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium.\n\n==Original text==\n===Hebrew Bible===\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] was mainly written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with some portions (notably in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]]) in [[Biblical Aramaic]]. From the 6th century to the 10th century CE, Jewish scholars, today known as [[Masoretes]], compared the text of all known [[biblical manuscript]]s in an effort to create a unified, standardized text. A series of highly similar texts eventually emerged, and any of these texts are known as [[Masoretic Texts]] (MT). The Masoretes also added vowel points (called [[niqqud]]) to the text, since the original text contained [[Abjad|only consonants]]. This sometimes required the selection of an interpretation; since some words differ only in their vowels their meaning can vary in accordance with the vowels chosen. In antiquity, variant Hebrew readings existed, some of which have survived in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] and other ancient fragments, as well as being attested in ancient versions in other languages.<ref name=\"Cohen1979\">Menachem Cohen, [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/CohenArt/ The Idea of the Sanctity of the Biblical Text and the Science of Textual Criticism] in ''HaMikrah V'anachnu'', ed.

Introduction F, N-2, p. 4A</ref> The ''autographs'', the Greek [[biblical manuscript|manuscripts]] written by the original authors, have not survived. Scholars surmise the original Greek text from the manuscripts that do survive. The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the [[Alexandrian text-type]], the [[Byzantine text-type]], and the [[Western text-type]].\n\nMost variants among the manuscripts are minor, such as alternative spelling, alternative word order, the presence or absence of an optional definite article (\"the\"), and so on. Occasionally, a major variant happens when a portion of a text was missing or for other reasons. Examples of major variants are the [[Mark 16|endings of Mark]], the [[Pericope Adulter\u00e6]], the [[Comma Johanneum]], and the [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Western version of Acts]].\n\nThe discovery of older manuscripts which belong to the Alexandrian text-type, including the 4th-century [[Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]], led scholars to revise their view about the original Greek text. [[Karl Lachmann]] based his [[Textual criticism|critical edition]] of 1831 on manuscripts dating from the 4th century and earlier, to argue that the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' must be corrected according to these earlier texts.\n\nEarly manuscripts of the [[Pauline epistles]] and other New Testament writings show [[Greek orthography|no punctuation]] whatsoever.<ref>http://greek-language.com/grklinguist/?p=657.</ref><ref>http://www.stpaulsirvine.org/images/papyruslg.gif| shows an example of the text without punctuation</ref> The [[punctuation]] was added later by other editors, according to their own understanding of the text.\n\n==History==\n=== Ancient translations ===\n\n\n====Aramaic Targums====\n{{main article|Targum}}\nSome of the first translations of the [[Torah]] began during the [[Babylonian exile]], when [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] became the [[lingua franca]] of the Jews. With most people speaking only Aramaic and not understanding Hebrew, the [[Targum]]s were created to allow the common person to understand the Torah as it was read in ancient [[synagogue]]s.\n\n====Greek Septuagint====\n{{main article|Septuagint}}\nBy the 3rd century BC, [[Alexandria]] had become the center of [[Hellenistic Judaism]], and during the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC translators compiled in Egypt a [[Koine Greek]] version of the Hebrew scriptures in several stages (completing the task by 132 BC). The [[Talmud]] ascribes the translation effort to [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] ([[r.]] 285\u2013246 BC), who allegedly hired 72 Jewish scholars for the purpose, for which reason the translation is commonly known as the Septuagint (from the Latin ''septuaginta'', \"seventy\"), a name which it gained in \"the time of [[Augustine of Hippo]]\" (354\u2013430 AD).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Sundberg | first = Albert C., Jr. | editor = McDonald, Lee Martin |editor2=Sanders, James A. | encyclopedia = The Canon Debate | title = The Septuagint: The Bible of Hellenistic Judaism | year = 2002 | publisher = Hendrickson Publishers | isbn = 978-1-56563-517-3 | pages = 72 }}</ref><ref>''The Canon Debate'', McDonald & Sanders editors, chapter by Sundberg, page 72, adds further detail: \"However, it was not until the time of [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430 CE) that the Greek translation of the Jewish scriptures came to be called by the Latin term ''septuaginta''. [70 rather than 72]\n\nJerome began by revising the earlier Latin translations, but ended by going back to the original Greek, bypassing all translations, and going back to the original Hebrew wherever he could instead of the Septuagint.\nThe New Testament and at least some of the Old Testament was translated into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] in the 4th century by [[Ulfilas]]. In the 5th century, [[Saint Mesrob]] translated the Bible into [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Also dating from the same period are the [[Peshitta|Syriac]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] translations.\n\nIn his ''City of God'' 18.42, while repeating the [[Letter of Aristeas|story of Aristeas]] with typical embellishments, Augustine adds the remark, \"It is their translation that it has now become traditional to call the Septuagint\" ...[Latin omitted]... Augustine thus indicates that this name for the Greek translation of the scriptures was a recent development. But he offers no clue as to which of the possible antecedents led to this development: {{bibleverse||Exod|24:1-8}}, [[Josephus]] [Antiquities 12.57, 12.86], or an elision. ...this name ''Septuagint'' appears to have been a fourth- to fifth-century development.\"</ref> The Septuagint (LXX), the very first translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into [[Greek language|Greek]], later became the accepted text of the [[Old Testament]] in the Christian church and the basis of its [[Biblical canon|canon]].

In some cases these additions were originally composed in Greek, while in other cases they are translations of Hebrew books or of Hebrew variants not present in the Masoretic texts. Recent discoveries have shown that more of the Septuagint additions have a Hebrew origin than previously thought. While there are no complete surviving manuscripts of the Hebrew texts on which the Septuagint was based, many{{quantify|date=March 2016}} scholars believe that they represent a different textual tradition (\"[[Vorlage]]\") from the one that became the basis for the Masoretic texts.<ref name=\"Cohen1979\">Menachem Cohen, [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/CohenArt/ The Idea of the Sanctity of the Biblical Text and the Science of Textual Criticism] in ''HaMikrah V'anachnu'', ed.

In addition, he included three anonymous translations of the Psalms (the ''Quinta'', ''Sexta'' and ''Septima''). His eclectic recension of the Septuagint had a significant influence on the Old Testament text in several important manuscripts. The canonical [[Christian Bible]] was formally established by Bishop [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] in 350 (although it had been generally accepted by the church previously), confirmed by the [[Council of Laodicea]] in 363 (both lacked the book of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]), and later established by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] in 367 (with [[Revelation]] added), and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Vulgate]]'' Latin translation dates to between AD 382 and 405. [[Latin]] translations predating Jerome are collectively known as ''[[Vetus Latina]]'' texts.\n\nChristian translations also tend to be based upon the Hebrew, though some denominations prefer the Septuagint (or may cite variant readings from both). Bible translations incorporating modern textual criticism usually begin with the masoretic text, but also take into account possible variants from all available ancient versions. The [[Textus Receptus|received text]] of the Christian [[New Testament]] is in [[Koine Greek]],{{efn|Some scholars hypothesize that certain books (whether completely or partially) may have been written in Aramaic before being translated for widespread dissemination. One very famous example of this is [[Logos|the opening]] to the [[Gospel of John]], which some scholars argue to be a Greek translation of an Aramaic hymn.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}}} and nearly all translations are based upon the Greek text.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nJerome began by revising the earlier Latin translations, but ended by going back to the original Greek, bypassing all translations, and going back to the original Hebrew wherever he could instead of the Septuagint.\n\nThe Bible [[Gothic Bible|was translated]] into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] in the 4th century by a group of scholars, possibly under the supervision of [[Ulfilas]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Falluomini|first1=Carla|title=The Gothic Version of the Gospels and Pauline Epistles: Cultural background, transmission and character|date=2015|publisher=De Gruyter|location=Berlin|doi=10.1515/9783110334692|isbn=9783110334692}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ratkus|first1=Art\u016bras|title=Greek \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 in Gothic translation: Linguistics and theology at a crossroads|journal=NOWELE|date=2018|volume=71|issue=1|page=3\u201334|doi=10.1075/nowele.00002.rat|url=https://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/nowele.00002.rat/details}}</ref> In the 5th century, [[Saint Mesrob]] translated the Bible using the [[Armenian alphabet]] invented by him.

[[Athanasius]] (''Apol. Const. 4'') recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for [[Constans]]. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for [[Biblical canon|canon lists]], and that [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Alexandrinus]] are examples of these Bibles. Together with the [[Peshitta]], these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.<ref>''The Canon Debate'', McDonald & Sanders editors, 2002, pp. 414-415, for the entire paragraph.</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{Main article|Bible translations in the Middle Ages}}\n[[File:Devil codex Gigas.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Codex Gigas]] from the 13th century, held at the [[Swedish Royal Library|Royal Library]] in [[Sweden]].]]\nWhen ancient scribes copied earlier books, they wrote notes on the margins of the page (''marginal [[Biblical gloss|glosses]]'') to correct their text\u2014especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line\u2014and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text. See [[textual criticism]]. Over time, different regions evolved different versions, each with its own assemblage of omissions, additions, and variants (mostly in [[orthography]]).\n\nThe earliest surviving complete manuscript of the entire Bible in Latin is the [[Codex Amiatinus]], a Latin Vulgate edition produced in 8th-century England at the double monastery of [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey|Wearmouth-Jarrow]].\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], translation, particularly of the Old Testament was discouraged. Nevertheless, there are some fragmentary [[Old English Bible translations]], notably a lost translation of the [[Gospel of John]] into Old English by the Venerable [[Bede]], which is said to have been prepared shortly before his death around the year 735. An [[Old High German]] version of the gospel of Matthew dates to 748. [[Charlemagne]] in ca. 800 charged [[Alcuin]] with a revision of the Latin Vulgate. The translation into [[Old Church Slavonic]] was started in 863 by [[Cyril and Methodius]].\n\n[[Alfred the Great]] had a number of passages of the Bible circulated in the vernacular in around 900. These included passages from the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Pentateuch]], which he prefixed to a code of laws he promulgated around this time. In approximately 990, a full and freestanding version of the four Gospels in idiomatic Old English appeared, in the [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] dialect; these are called the ''[[Wessex Gospels]]''. Around the same time, a compilation now called the ''[[Old English Hexateuch]]'' appeared with the first six (or, in one version, seven) books of the Old Testament.\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]] in 1199 [[censorship of the Bible|banned]] unauthorized versions of the Bible as a reaction to the [[Cathar]] and [[Waldensian]] heresies. The [[Council of Toulouse|synods of Toulouse]] and Tarragona (1234) outlawed possession of such renderings. There is evidence of some vernacular translations being permitted while others were being scrutinized.\n\nThe complete Bible was translated into Old French in the late 13th century. Parts of this translation were included in editions of the popular ''Bible historiale'', and there is no evidence of this translation being suppressed by the Church.<ref>Sneddon, Clive R. 1993. \"A neglected mediaeval Bible translation.\" ''Romance Languages Annual'' 5(1): 11-16 [http://tell.fll.purdue.edu/RLA-Archive/1993/French-html/Sneddon,Clive.htm].</ref> The entire Bible was translated into Czech around 1360.\n\nThe most notable [[Middle English Bible translation]], [[Wycliffe's Bible]] (1383), based on the Vulgate, was banned by the Oxford Synod in 1408. A Hungarian [[Hussite]] Bible appeared in the mid 15th century, and in 1478, a Catalan translation in the dialect of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]].  Many parts of the Bible were printed by [[William Caxton]] in his translation of the [[Golden Legend]], and in ''Speculum Vitae Christi'' (''[[The Mirror of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ]]'').\n\n===Reformation and Early Modern period===\n{{See also|Early Modern English Bible translations}}\n[[File:Bible Kralicka.JPG|thumb|250px|Czech Protestant [[Bible of Kralice]] (1593)]]\nThe earliest printed edition of the Greek New Testament appeared in 1516 from the [[Johann Froben|Froben]] press, by [[Erasmus|Desiderius Erasmus]], who reconstructed its Greek text from several recent manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type. He occasionally added a Greek translation of the Latin Vulgate for parts that did not exist in the Greek manuscripts. He produced four later editions of this text. Erasmus was Roman Catholic, but his preference for the [[Byzantine Greek]] manuscripts rather than the [[Latin Vulgate]] led some church authorities to view him with suspicion.\n\nDuring 1517 and 1519 [[Francysk Skaryna]] printed a translation of the Bible in [[Old Belarusian language]] in twenty-two books.<ref>\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u044f (\u0414\u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a \u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430) \u0421\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044b, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0423\u043b\u044f\u0445\u0438\u043d, \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0446\u043a, 1994</ref>\n\nIn 1521, [[Martin Luther]] was placed under the [[Imperial ban|Ban of the Empire]], and he retired to the [[Wartburg Castle]]. During his time there, he translated the New Testament from Greek into German. It was printed in September 1522. The first complete Dutch Bible, partly based on the existing portions of Luther's translation, was printed in [[Antwerp]] in 1526 by [[Jacob van Liesvelt]].<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, p. 120.</ref>\n\nThe first printed edition with ''[[critical apparatus]]'' (noting variant readings among the manuscripts) was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for \"received text\"), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' (\"now received by all\").\n\nThe use of numbered chapters and verses was not introduced until the Middle Ages and later. The system used in English was developed by Stephanus ([[Robert Estienne]] of Paris) (see [[Chapters and verses of the Bible]])\n\nLater critical editions incorporate ongoing scholarly research, including discoveries of Greek papyrus fragments from near Alexandria, Egypt, that date in some cases within a few decades of the original New Testament writings.<ref>Metzger, Bruce R. ''Manuscripts of the Greek Bible: An Introduction to Paleography'' (Oxford University Press, 1981) cf. [[Papyrus 52]].</ref> Today, most critical editions of the Greek New Testament, such as UBS4 and [[NA27]], consider the Alexandrian text-type corrected by papyri, to be the Greek text that is closest to the original ''autographs''. Their ''apparatus'' includes the result of votes among scholars, ranging from certain {A} to doubtful {E}, on which variants best preserve the original Greek text of the New Testament.\n\nCritical editions that rely primarily on the Alexandrian text-type inform nearly all modern translations (and revisions of older translations). For reasons of tradition, however, some translators prefer to use the Textus Receptus for the Greek text, or use the ''[[Majority Text]]'' which is similar to it but is a critical edition that relies on earlier manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type. Among these, some argue that the Byzantine tradition contains scribal additions, but these later interpolations preserve the orthodox interpretations of the biblical text\u2014as part of the ongoing Christian experience\u2014and in this sense are authoritative. Distrust of the textual basis of modern translations has contributed to the [[King-James-Only Movement]].\n\nThe churches of the [[Protestant Reformation]] translated the Greek of the Textus Receptus to produce [[vernacular]] Bibles, such as the German [[Luther Bible]] (1522), the Polish [[Brest Bible]] (1563), the Spanish \"Biblia del Oso\" (in English: Bible of the Bear, 1569) which later became the [[Reina-Valera]] Bible upon its first revision in 1602, the Czech [[Melantrich Bible]] (1549) and [[Bible of Kralice]] (1579-1593) and numerous English translations of the Bible. [[William Tyndale|Tyndale's]] [[Tyndale's Bible|New Testament translation]] (1526, revised in 1534, 1535 and 1536) and his translation of the [[Pentateuch]] (1530, 1534) and the [[Book of Jonah]] were met with heavy sanctions given the widespread belief that Tyndale ''changed'' the Bible as he attempted to translate it. Tyndale's unfinished work, cut short by his execution, was supplemented by [[Myles Coverdale]] and published under a pseudonym to create the [[Matthew Bible]], the first complete English translation of the Bible. Attempts at an \"authoritative\" English Bible for the [[Church of England]] would include the [[Great Bible]] of 1538 (also relying on Coverdale's work), the [[Bishops' Bible]] of 1568, and the Authorized Version (the [[King James Version]]) of 1611, the last of which would become a standard for English speaking Christians for several centuries.\n\nThe first complete French Bible was a translation by [[Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples]], published in 1530 in [[Antwerp]].<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, pp. 134-135.</ref> The [[Froschauer Bible]] of 1531 and the [[Luther Bible]] of 1534 (both appearing in portions throughout the 1520s) were an important part of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].\n\nThe first English translations of [[Psalms]] (1530), [[Isaiah]] (1531), [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (1533), [[Ecclesiastes]] (1533), [[Jeremiah]] (1534) and [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] (1534), were executed by the Protestant Bible translator [[George Joye]] in [[Antwerp]]. In 1535 Myles Coverdale published the first complete [[Coverdale Bible|English Bible]] also in [[Antwerp]].<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, pp. 143-145.</ref>\n\nBy 1578 both Old and New Testaments were translated to [[Slovene language|Slovene]] by the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writer and theologian [[Jurij Dalmatin]]. The work was not printed until 1583. The [[Slovenes]] thus became the 12th nation in the world with a complete Bible in their language. The translation of the New Testament was based on the work by Dalmatin's mentor, the Protestant [[Primo\u017e Trubar]], who published the translation of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] already in 1555 and the entire testament by parts until 1577.\n\nFollowing the distribution of a Welsh New Testament and Prayer Book to every parish Church in Wales in 1567, translated by [[William Salesbury]], Welsh became the 13th language into which the whole Bible had been translated in 1588, through a translation by William Morgan, the bishop of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant.<ref>J.

Inside the Bible-translation community, these are commonly categorized as:\n* [[Dynamic equivalence]] translation\n* [[Formal equivalence]] translation (similar to [[literal translation]])\n* [[Idiomatic]], or [[Paraphrase|paraphrastic]] translation, as used by the late [[Kenneth N. Taylor]]\n\nthough modern linguists, such as Bible scholar Dr. Joel Hoffman, disagree with this classification.<ref>[http://goddidntsaythat.com/2009/10/05/formal-equivalence-and-dynamic-equivalence-a-false-dichotom/ \"Formal Equivalence and Dynamic Equivalence: A False Dichotomy\"]</ref>\n\nAs [[Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]], the original languages of the Bible, like all languages, have some [[idiom]]s and concepts [[Untranslatability|not easily translated]], there is in some cases an ongoing critical tension about whether it is better to give a word for word translation or to give a translation that gives a parallel idiom in the target language. For instance, in the [[Douay Rheims Bible]], [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition]], [[New American Bible Revised Edition]], which are the English language [[Catholic]] translations, as well as [[Protestant]] translations like the [[King James Bible]], the [[Darby Bible]], the [[Recovery Version]], the [[New Revised Standard Version]], the [[Modern Literal Version]], and the [[New American Standard Bible]] are seen as more literal translations (or \"word for word\"), whereas translations like the [[New International Version]] and [[New Living Translation]] sometimes attempt to give relevant parallel idioms. [[The Living Bible]] and [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]] are two paraphrases of the Bible that try to convey the original meaning in contemporary language. The further away one gets from word for word translation, the easier the text becomes to read while relying more on the theological, linguistic or cultural understanding of the translator, which one would not normally expect a lay reader to require. On the other hand, as one gets closer to a word for word translation, the text becomes more literal but still relies on similar problems of meaningful translation at the word level and makes it difficult for lay readers to interpret due to their unfamiliarity with ancient idioms and other historical and cultural contexts.\n\n===Doctrinal differences and translation policy===\n {{Further|Tetragrammaton in the New Testament}}\nIn addition to linguistic concerns, theological issues also drive Bible translations. Some translations of the Bible, produced by single churches or groups of churches, may be seen as subject to a point of view by the translation committee.\n\nFor example, the [[New World Translation]], produced by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], provides different renderings where verses in other Bible translations support the deity of Christ.<ref>http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/new-world-translation-accurate/#?insight[search_id]=ab273185-8135-4ee9-a212-210cef439f3e&insight[search_result_index]=0</ref> The NWT also translates ''kurios'' as \"[[Jehovah]]\" rather than \"Lord\" when quoting Hebrew passages that used YHWH. The authors believe that Jesus would have used God's name and not the customary ''kurios''. On this basis, the anonymous New World Bible Translation Committee inserted ''Jehovah'' into the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures (New Testament) a total of 237 times while the New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) uses Jehovah a total of 6,979 times to a grand total of 7,216 in the entire 2013 Revision New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures while previous revisions such as the 1984 revision were a total of 7,210 times while the 1961 revision were a total of 7,199 times.<ref>''New World Translation'' appendix, pp. 1564-1566. When discussing \u201cRestoring the Divine Name,\u201d the New World Bible Translation Committee states: \u201cTo know where the divine name was replaced by the Greek words \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, we have determined where the inspired Christian writers have quoted verses, passages and expressions from the Hebrew Scriptures and then we have referred back to the Hebrew text to ascertain whether the divine name appears there. In this way we determined the identity to give Ky\u02b9ri\u00b7os and The\u00b7os\u02b9 and the personality with which to clothe them.\u201d Explaining further, the Committee said: \u201cTo avoid overstepping the bounds of a translator into the field of exegesis, we have been most cautious about rendering the divine name in the Christian Greek Scriptures, always carefully considering the Hebrew Scriptures as a background. We have looked for agreement from the Hebrew versions to confirm our rendering.\u201d Such agreement from Hebrew versions exists in all the 237 places that the New World Bible Translation Committee has rendered the divine name in the body of its translation.\u2014NW appendix, pp. 1564-1566</ref>\n\nA number of [[Sacred Name Bibles]] (e.g., the [[Sacred Scriptures Bethel Edition]]) have been published that are even more rigorous in transliterating the tetragrammaton using Semitic forms to translate it in the Old Testament and also using the same Semitic forms to translate the Greek word ''Theos'' (God) in the New Testament\u2014usually Yahweh, Elohim or some other variation.\n\nOther translations are distinguished by smaller but distinctive doctrinal differences. For example, the [[Purified Translation of the Bible]], by translation and explanatory footnotes, promoting the position that Christians should not drink alcohol, that New Testament references to \"wine\" are translated as \"grape juice\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n; Ancient and classical translations&#x3a;\n* [[Coptic versions of the Bible]]\n* [[Syriac versions of the Bible]]\n* [[Targum]] and [[Peshitta]] (Aramaic)\n* [[Vetus Latina]] and [[Vulgate]] (Latin)\n\n;English translations&#x3a;\n* [[Early Modern English Bible translations]]\n* [[English translations of the Bible]]\n* [[Jewish English Bible translations]]\n* [[Old English Bible translations]]\n* [[Middle English Bible translations]]\n* [[Modern English Bible translations]]\n\n; Other languages&#x3a;\n* [[Bible translations by language]]\n* [[Naro Bible]]\n* [[Bible translations into Ladakhi]]\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of Africa]]\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of India]]\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of Indonesia]]\n\n;Difficulties&#x3a;\n* [[Gender in Bible translation]]\n* [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy#Translation and interpretation]]\n* [[Translation#Fidelity and transparency]]\n\n;Others&#x3a;\n* [[Bibledit]]\n* [[Bible version debate]]\n* [[Byzantine text-type]]\n* [[Bible concordance]]\n* [[Exegesis]]\n* [[Hermeneutics]]\n* [[Institute for Bible Translation]]\n* [[List of languages by year of first Bible translation]]\n* [[Skopos theory]]\n* [[Textus Receptus]]\n* [[Translation]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Garry Wills|Wills, Garry]], \"A Wild and Indecent Book\" (review of [[David Bentley Hart]], ''The New Testament:  A Translation'', [[Yale University Press]], 577 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

All Soyuz rockets use [[RP-1]] and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) propellant, with the exception of the [[Soyuz-U2]], which used [[Syntin]], a variant of RP-1, with LOX. The Soyuz family is a subset of the [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7 family]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Soyuz rocket engines.jpg|thumb|Soyuz rocket engines]]\n\n=== A space workhorse ===\n{{main|Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz-U|Soyuz-FG}}\nThe Soyuz launcher was introduced in 1966, deriving from the [[Vostok (rocket family)|Vostok]] launcher, which in turn was based on the 8K74 or [[R-7a rocket|R-7a]] [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]. It was initially a three-stage rocket with a Block I upper stage. Later a [[Molniya (rocket)|Molniya variant]] was produced by adding a fourth stage, allowing it to reach the highly elliptical [[molniya orbit]]. A later variant was the [[Soyuz-U]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samspace.ru/ENG/RN/ser_souz.htm |title=\"Soyuz\" - series launch vehicles |publisher=Samara Space Centre |accessdate=29 March 2013 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207031915/http://www.samspace.ru/ENG/RN/ser_souz.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2012 }}</ref> While the exact model and variant designations were kept secret from the west, the Soyuz launcher was referred to by either the [[DoD|United States Department of Defense]] designation of SL-4, or the Sheldon designation of A-2 (developed by Charles S. Sheldon, an analyst with the Library of Congress). Both systems for naming Soviet rockets stopped being used as more accurate information became available.<ref name=\"LardierBarensky2013\">{{cite book|author1=Christian Lardier|author2=Stefan Barensky|title=The Soyuz Launch Vehicle: The Two Lives of an Engineering Triumph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CWRIAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA233|date=12 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-5459-5|pages=233\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe production of Soyuz launchers reached a peak of 60 per year in the early 1980s. It has become the world's most used space launcher, flying over 1700 times, far more than any other rocket. Despite its age and perhaps thanks to its simplicity, this rocket family has been notable for its low cost and high reliability.\n\n=== Soyuz / Fregat ===\n{{main|Fregat}}\nIn the early 1990s plans were made for a redesigned Soyuz with a [[Fregat]] upper stage. The Fregat engine was developed by [[NPO Lavochkin]] from the propulsion module of its [[Phobos program|Phobos interplanetary probes]]. Although endorsed by the [[Russian Space Agency]] and the [[Russian Ministry of Defence]] in 1993 and designated \"Rus\" as a Russification and modernisation of Soyuz, and later renamed Soyuz-2, a funding shortage prevented implementation of the plan. The creation of [[Starsem]] in July 1996 provided new funding for the creation of a less ambitious variant, the Soyuz-Fregat or Soyuz U/Fregat. This consisted of a slightly modified Soyuz U combined with the Fregat upper stage, with a capacity of up to 1,350&nbsp;kg to [[geostationary transfer orbit]]. In April 1997, Starsem obtained a contract from the [[European Space Agency]] to launch two pairs of [[Cluster mission|Cluster 2 plasma science satellites]] using the Soyuz-Fregat. Before the introduction of this new model, Starsem launched 24 satellites of the [[Globalstar]] constellation in 6 launches with a restartable Ikar upper stage, between September 22, 1999 and November 22, 1999. After successful test flights of Soyuz-Fregat on February 9, 2000 and March 20, 2000, the Cluster 2 satellites were launched on July 16, 2000 and August 9, 2000. Another Soyuz-Fregat launched the ESA's [[Mars Express]] probe from Baikonur in June 2003. Now the Soyuz-Fregat launcher is used by Starsem for commercial payloads.\n\n[[Image:Soyuz TMA-13 erected at Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Soyuz-FG]] erected at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] launch pad 1/5 ''[[Gagarin's Start]]'' (October 2008)]]\n\n=== ISS crew transport ===\nBetween February 1, 2003 and July 26, 2005 with the grounding of the U.S. [[Space Shuttle]] fleet, Soyuz was the only means of transportation to and from the International Space Station. This included the transfer of supplies, via Progress spacecraft, and crew changeovers. Since the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2011, the U.S. space program is without any means to take astronauts into orbit, and [[NASA]] is dependent on the Soyuz to send crew into space for the immediate future.<ref name=sfn-20140527>{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1405/27soyuz/ |title=NASA's latest Soyuz seat procurement may be its last |author=Stephen Clark |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date=27 May 2014 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}</ref> NASA is scheduled to resume crewed flights from the United States in 2020 through the [[Commercial Crew Development]] program.\n\n=== Recent incidents ===\nA long string of successful Soyuz launches was broken on October 15, 2002 when the uncrewed Soyuz U launch of the Photon-M satellite from Plesetsk fell back near the launch pad and exploded 29 seconds after lift-off. One person from the ground crew was killed and eight injured.\n\nAnother failure occurred on June 21, 2005, during a [[Molniya (satellite)|Molniya]] [[military]] [[communications satellite]] launch from the Plesetsk launch site, which used a four-stage version of the rocket called [[Molniya-M]]. The flight ended six minutes after the launch because of a failure of the third stage engine or an unfulfilled order to separate the second and third stages. The rocket's second and third stages, which are identical to the Soyuz, and its payload (a Molniya-3K satellite) crashed in the Uvatski region of [[Tyumen]] ([[Siberia]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20050621/40556511.html |title=Molniya-M accident caused by engine failure or unfulfilled order |date=June 21, 2005 |publisher=RIA Novosti |accessdate=29 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 2011, an uncrewed Soyuz-U carrying cargo to the International Space Station crashed, failing to reach orbit.

The [[launch escape system]] was used to pull the Soyuz spacecraft away from the malfunctioning rocket.

The first development version of Soyuz 2 called Soyuz-2-1a, which is already equipped with the digital guidance system, but is still propelled by an old third stage engine, started on November 4, 2004 from Plesetsk on a suborbital test flight, followed by an orbital flight on October 23, 2006 from Baikonur.

It has become the world's most used space launcher, flying over 1700 times, far more than any other rocket. Despite its age and perhaps thanks to its simplicity, this rocket family has been notable for its low cost and high reliability.\n\n=== Soyuz / Fregat ===\n{{main|Fregat}}\nIn the early 1990s plans were made for a redesigned Soyuz with a [[Fregat]] upper stage.  The Fregat engine was developed by [[NPO Lavochkin]] from the propulsion module of its [[Phobos program|Phobos interplanetary probes]]. Although endorsed by the [[Russian Space Agency]] and the [[Russian Ministry of Defence]] in 1993 and designated \"Rus\" as a Russification and modernisation of Soyuz, and later renamed Soyuz-2, a funding shortage prevented implementation of the plan.  The creation of [[Starsem]] in July 1996 provided new funding for the creation of a less ambitious variant, the Soyuz-Fregat or Soyuz U/Fregat. This consisted of a slightly modified Soyuz U combined with the Fregat upper stage, with a capacity of up to 1,350&nbsp;kg to [[geostationary transfer orbit]]. In April 1997, Starsem obtained a contract from the [[European Space Agency]] to launch two pairs of [[Cluster mission|Cluster 2 plasma science satellites]] using the Soyuz-Fregat.  Before the introduction of this new model, Starsem launched 24 satellites of the [[Globalstar]] constellation in 6 launches with a restartable Ikar upper stage, between September 22, 1999 and November 22, 1999.  After successful test flights of Soyuz-Fregat on February 9, 2000 and March 20, 2000, the Cluster 2 satellites were launched on July 16, 2000 and August 9, 2000.  Another Soyuz-Fregat launched the ESA's [[Mars Express]] probe from Baikonur in June 2003. Now the Soyuz-Fregat launcher is used by Starsem for commercial payloads.\n\n[[Image:Soyuz TMA-13 erected at Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Soyuz-FG]] erected at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] launch pad 1/5 ''[[Gagarin's Start]]'' (October 2008)]]\n\n=== ISS crew transport ===\nBetween February 1, 2003 and July 26, 2005 with the grounding of the U.S. [[Space Shuttle]] fleet, Soyuz was the only means of transportation to and from the International Space Station. This included the transfer of supplies, via Progress spacecraft, and crew changeovers.  Since the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2011, the U.S. space program is without any means to take astronauts into orbit, and [[NASA]] is dependent on the Soyuz to send crew into space for the immediate future.<ref name=sfn-20140527>{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1405/27soyuz/ |title=NASA's latest Soyuz seat procurement may be its last |author=Stephen Clark |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date=27 May 2014 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}</ref> NASA is scheduled to resume crewed flights from the United States in 2020 through the [[Commercial Crew Development]] program.\n\n=== Recent incidents ===\nA long string of successful Soyuz launches was broken on October 15, 2002 when the uncrewed Soyuz U launch of the Photon-M satellite from Plesetsk fell back near the launch pad and exploded 29 seconds after lift-off.

The flight ended six minutes after the launch because of a failure of the third stage engine or an unfulfilled order to separate the second and third stages. The rocket's second and third stages, which are identical to the Soyuz, and its payload (a Molniya-3K satellite) crashed in the Uvatski region of [[Tyumen]] ([[Siberia]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20050621/40556511.html |title=Molniya-M accident caused by engine failure or unfulfilled order |date=June 21, 2005 |publisher=RIA Novosti |accessdate=29 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 2011, an uncrewed Soyuz-U carrying cargo to the International Space Station crashed, failing to reach orbit.

The two crew, [[Aleksey Ovchinin]] and [[Nick Hague]], followed a ballistic trajectory and landed safely over 400&nbsp;km downrange from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]].\n\n=== Soyuz-2 and Guiana spaceport ===\n[[Image:Soyuz 2 metop.jpg|thumb|[[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz 2]] ready to launch (2007)]]\n{{main|Soyuz-2|Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre}}\n\nThe venerable Soyuz launcher is gradually being replaced by a new version, now named Soyuz/ST (or [[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz-2]]), which has a new digital guidance system and a highly modified third stage with a new engine. The first development version of Soyuz 2 called Soyuz-2-1a, which is already equipped with the digital guidance system, but is still propelled by an old third stage engine, started on November 4, 2004 from Plesetsk on a suborbital test flight, followed by an orbital flight on October 23, 2006 from Baikonur. The fully modified launcher (version Soyuz-2-1b) flew first on December 27, 2006 with the [[CoRoT]] satellite from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]].\n\nOn 19 January 2005, the [[European Space Agency]] and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] agreed to launch Soyuz/ST rockets from the [[Guiana Space Centre]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Industry/Industry_how_to_do_business/Closer_ties_between_ESA_and_Russia |title=Closer ties between ESA and Russia |date=19 January 2005 |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=29 March 2013 }}</ref> The equatorial launch site allows the Soyuz to deliver 2.7 to 4.9 tonnes into [[sun-synchronous orbit]], depending on the third-stage engine used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bulletin132/bul132h_arend.pdf |title=Soyuz at the European Spaceport |date=Nov 2007 |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=29 March 2013 }}</ref> Construction of a new pad started in 2005 and was completed in April 2011.

The [[Soyuz spacecraft]], covered by its launch shroud, is in the lower right corner.]]\nThe rocket is assembled horizontally in the Assembly and Testing Building. The assembled rocket is transported to the launch site in its horizontal state and then raised. This is different from the vertical assembly of, for example, the [[Saturn V]], and is one of the features that makes Soyuz cheaper{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} to prepare for launch.\n\nAssembling a horizontally positioned rocket is relatively simple as all modules are easily accessible. Assembling the rocket in vertical position would require a windproof high-rise hangar, which was not considered financially feasible at the time the rocket was designed, due to the failing economy of the Soviet Union{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}.\n\n== Prelaunch ==\n[[Image:Soyuz TMA-13 arrives at Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Soyuz TMA-13]] being erected at the [[Gagarin's Start]] launch pad, October 10, 2008.]]\nThe entire rocket is suspended in the launch system by the load-bearing mechanisms on the strap-on boosters where they are attached to the central core. The latter rests on the nose sections of the strap-on boosters. This scheme resembles flight conditions when the strap-on boosters push the central core forward. The concept of suspending the rocket was one of the novelties introduced with the R-7/Soyuz.\n\nSince the launch pad has been eliminated, the bottom portion of the rocket is lowered. The launch system trusses bear the wind loads. Resistance to high wind is an important feature of the launch system, as the Kazakhstan steppes, where the Baikonur launch site is located, are known for windstorms.\n{{clear left}}\n\n== Launch ==\n[[Image:Soyuz rocket ASTP.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Soyuz-U]] on the launch pad, ahead of the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|{{nowrap|Soyuz 19}} (ASTP)]] launch on 15 July 1975]]\nThe engines are ignited by electrically initiated pyrotechnic flares, mounted on birch poles, which are ignited at approximately T-20, a few seconds before fuel components are introduced into the combustion chamber.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a19966/russia-actually-lights-it-rockets-with-a-giant-match/|title=Russia Actually Lights Rockets With an Oversized Wooden Match|website=Popular Mechanics|first=Anatoly|last=Zak|date=2016-03-17|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-11}}</ref> This sequence rarely fails due to its simplicity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spaceflight101.com/soyuz-resurs-p3/soyuz-rocket-suffers-rare-abort-at-ignition/|title=Soyuz Rocket suffers rare Abort at Ignition \u2013 Soyuz {{!}} Resurs-P No.3 {{!}}Spaceflight101|website=spaceflight101.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref> During launch, the support booms track the movement of the rocket. After the support boom heads emerge from the special support recess in the nose sections of the strapons, the support booms and trusses disconnect from the rocket airframe, swiveling on the support axes and freeing the way for the rocket to lift off. During launch, the rocket and the launch facility form a single dynamic system.\n\nWhen the strapon booster engines stop, the boosters fall away, providing nonimpact separation. If the skies are clear, ground observers can see a [[Korolev cross]] formed by the falling boosters.\n\n== Fairings used for uncrewed missions ==\n\nThe Soyuz [[launch vehicle]] is used for various Russian uncrewed missions and is also marketed by Starsem for commercial satellite launches.

In [[Indian English]], it is often referred to as [[buttermilk]].\n\n==Preparation and variations==\nChaas is made by churning yogurt (curds/dahi) and cold water together in a pot, using a hand-held instrument called ''madhani'' (whipper). This can be consumed plain or seasoned with a variety of spices. Chaas can be made from fresh yogurt, and the natural flavour of such chaas is mildly sweet. This type of chaas is very close to [[lassi]], with two major differences: chaas is more dilute (with water) than lassi and unlike lassi, chaas does not have [[added sugar]].\n\nAlthough chaas can be made from fresh yogurt (curds/dahi), it is more commonly made at home from yogurt that is a few days old and has become sour due to age. Indeed, one of the purposes for making chaas at home is to usefully finish off old yogurt that is lying in the fridge for long. Such chaas has a tangy, slightly sour taste which is considered delicious. A pinch of salt is usually added to it for further enhancement of taste, and other seasonings can be added also, as described below.\n\nA third variation of chaas is obtained by adding actual buttermilk (water left over after churning butter) into the chaas. This gives a slightly sour-bitter taste to the final product, and it is necessary to add seasonings to mask these flavours. Chaas made using buttermilk is very healthy but the taste is not relished by all. However, if proper seasonings and spices are used, it can be delicious. This type of chaas is more unusual and rare compared to the other types, because it is available only when butter is churned at home.\n\n==Seasoning and flavours==\nChaas can be consumed plain, but a little salt is usually added. This is the most common seasoning for chaas. Numerous other seasonings and spices can be added to salted chaas, either singly or in combination with each other. These spices are usually roasted in a [[wok]], using a spoonful of cooking oil, before being added to the Chaas. The spices which can be added thus are: Coarsely ground and roasted [[cumin]] seeds, curry leaves, [[asafoetida]], grated ginger, very finely diced green chillies and [[Mustard seed]]s.\n\nSugar can also be added to chaas, but if sugar is added, then neither salt nor spice can be used. Adding sugar to chaas makes it very similar to [[lassi]], the main difference being that chaas is more dilute (with water) than lassi. Lassi is more popular in [[Punjab]] and certain regions of north India, while chaas (known by various named) is popular in all other parts of the country.\n\nVendors have come up with several proprietary products and standardized flavours of chaas which are produced on an industrial scale and sold as bottled drinks. The best-seller among such brands is [[Amul]]'s ''Masala Chaas,'' which has standardized several traditional flavours for the mass bottled-drink market. Other popular modern flavours available as bottled drinks include rose-flavoured ''Chaas Gulabi'' and mint-flavoured ''Mint Chaas''. Both have added sugar and differ from flavoured [[lassi]] in being more dilute and less expensive.\n\n==Consumption==\nIn India, the consumption of chaas has cultural resonances and associations which are not found in the context of other beverages like tea, coffee or lassi. An earthen pot is used to prepare chaas and store it for a few hours before consumption. The use of an earthen pot makes the chaas cool even in summer. In the extremely hot desert areas of [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]], people consume chaas with salt after getting exposed to the sun because this may aid rehydration. Chaas is consumed all year round. It is usually taken immediately after meals, but is also consumed on its own as a beverage.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[List of fermented foods]]\n* [[List of Indian beverages]]\n* [[Mattha]]\n*[[Borhani]], a similar Bangladeshi drink\n*[[Ayran]], a similar Turkish drink\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.tarladalal.com/Masala-Chaas-%28-Spicy-Buttermilk%29-31316r Chass recipe by Tarla Dalal]\n\n{{Yogurts}}\n\n[[Category:Fermented dairy products]]\n[[Category:Non-alcoholic drinks]]\n[[Category:Indian drinks]]\n[[Category:Yogurt-based drinks]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the town in ancient Elis|Chaas (Elis)}}\n{{Infobox prepared food\n| name             = Chaach\n| image            = Mint lassi.jpg\n| caption          = A glass full of chaas\n| alternate_name   = \n| national_cuisine = [[Indian cuisine|India]], [[Bangladeshi cuisine|Bangladesh]], [[Pakistani cuisine|Pakistan]]\n| region           = [[Indian subcontinent]]\n| creator          =\n| course           = Beverage \n| served           =\n| country = Indian subcontinent\n| main_ingredient  = [[Dahi (curd)|Dahi]] (yogurt), [[water]], spices\n| variations       = \n| calories         =\n| other            =\n}}\n'''Chaas''' ([[:gu:\u0a9b\u0abe\u0ab6|gu:\u0a9b\u0abe\u0ab6]], [[:hi:\u091b\u093e\u091b|hi:\u091b\u093e\u091b]]) is a [[dahi (curd)|dahi]] (yogurt)-based drink popular across [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref>Fatih Yildiz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zMCDLlcRaQkC&pg=PA11&dq= ''Development and Manufacture of Yogurt and Other Functional Dairy Products''], [[CRC Press]], 2010, p. 11</ref> It is also written ''chhaachh''.
