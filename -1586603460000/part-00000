The modern concept began to be developed with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], which allowed the use of complex mechanics, and the subsequent introduction of electricity. This made it possible to power machines with small compact motors. In the early 20th century, the notion of a [[humanoid]] machine was developed. Today, one can envisage human-sized robots with the capacity for near-human thoughts and movement.\n\nThe first uses of modern robots were in factories as [[industrial robot]]s \u2013 simple fixed machines capable of manufacturing tasks which allowed production with less need for human assistance. Digitally controlled [[industrial robot]]s and robots using [[artificial intelligence]] have been built since the 2000s.\n\n==Early legends==\n[[File:Roman de la Rose f. 130r (Pygmalion's story, working on his sculpture).jpg|thumb|200px|Miniature from a 14th-century manuscript of Pygmalion working on his sculpture]]\n\nConcepts of artificial servants and companions date at least as far back as the ancient legends of [[Cadmus]], who is said to have sown dragon teeth that turned into soldiers and [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] whose statue of [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]] came to life.

The statues were animated and played a key role in religious ceremonies. They were believed to have a soul (a [[ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#k\ua723 \"double\"|k\ua723]]), derived from the divinity they represented. In the [[Ramesside period|New Kingdom of Egypt]], from the 16th century BC till the 11th century BC, ancient Egyptians would frequently consult these statues for advice. The statues would reply with a movement of the head.

The automation was indistinguishable from a human and performed various tricks for the king and his entourage. But the king flew into a rage when apparently the automation started to flirt with the ladies in attendance and threatened the automation with execution. So the craftsman cut the automation open and revealed the inner workings of the artificial man. The king is fascinated and experiments with the functional interdependence of the automation by removing different organlike components. The king marveled \"is it then possible for human skill to achieve as much as the Creator?\" and confiscated the automation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Wind with Liezi: New Perspectives on the Daoist Classic|authors=Ronnie Littlejohn, Jeffrey Dippmann|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2011|isbn=9781438434551|pages=194\u2013195}}</ref> A similar tale can be found in the near contemporary Indian Buddhist [[Jataka tales]], but here the intricacy of the automation does not match that of Master Yan.<ref name=\"SUNY Press\"/> Prior to the introduction of Buddhism in the [[Common Era]], Chinese philosophers did not seriously consider the distinction between appearance and reality.

The plans for making such humanoid automations were stolen from the kingdom of Rome, a generic term for the Greco-Roman-Byzantine culture. According to the ''Lokapannatti'', the Yavanas (\"Greek-speakers\") used the automations to carry out trade and farming, but also captured and executed criminals. Roman automation makers who left the kingdom were pursued and killed by the automations. According to the ''Lokapannatti'', the emperor [[Asoka]] hears the story of the secret stupa and sets out to find it. Following a battle between with the fierce warrior automations, Asoka finds the long-lived engineer who had constructed the automations and is shown how to dismantle and control them. Thus emperor Asoka manages to command a large army of automated warriors. This Indian tale reflects the fear of losing control of artificial beings, which has also been expressed in Greek myths about the dragon-teeth army.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gods and Robots: Myths, Machines, and Ancient Dreams of Technology|authors=Adrienne Mayor|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780691185446|pages=205\u2013206}}</ref>\n\nInspired by European [[Christian legend]] medieval Europeans devised [[brazen head]]s that could answer questions posed to them.

Ctesibius built human like automata, often these were used in religious ceremonies and the worship of deities.

The modern concept began to be developed with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], which allowed the use of complex mechanics, and the subsequent introduction of electricity. This made it possible to power machines with small compact motors. In the early 20th century, the notion of a [[humanoid]] machine was developed. Today, one can envisage human-sized robots with the capacity for near-human thoughts and movement.\n\nThe first uses of modern robots were in factories as [[industrial robot]]s \u2013 simple fixed machines capable of manufacturing tasks which allowed production with less need for human assistance. Digitally controlled [[industrial robot]]s and robots using [[artificial intelligence]] have been built since the 2000s.\n\n==Early legends==\n[[File:Roman de la Rose f. 130r (Pygmalion's story, working on his sculpture).jpg|thumb|200px|Miniature from a 14th-century manuscript of Pygmalion working on his sculpture]]\n\nConcepts of artificial servants and companions date at least as far back as the ancient legends of [[Cadmus]], who is said to have sown dragon teeth that turned into soldiers and [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] whose statue of [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]] came to life.

The automation was indistinguishable from a human and performed various tricks for the king and his entourage. But the king flew into a rage when apparently the automation started to flirt with the ladies in attendance and threatened the automation with execution.

The robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled by remote control or voice control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reffell.org.uk/people/ericrobot.php|title=AH Reffell & Eric Robot (1928)|access-date=11 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111132524/http://www.reffell.org.uk/people/ericrobot.php|archive-date=11 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===1930s===\nThe earliest designs of [[industrial robots]] were put into production in the United States.

He wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of [[neurons|brain cells]] could give rise to very complex [[behavior]]s - essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as \"tortoises\" due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of [[phototaxis]], by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nWalter stressed the importance of using purely [[wiktionary:analogue|analogue]] electronics to [[simulate]] brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as [[Alan Turing]] and [[John von Neumann]] were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of [[digital data|digital]] [[computation]].
