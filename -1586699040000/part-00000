He had previously told the ''Wall Street Journal'' that he pays rent of $800 a month for his apartment, but told the ''New York Times'' that he definitely did not pay rent. He pays the rent for an apartment McMillan shares with his son in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] in [[Manhattan]], which is $900 per month under current rent controls.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sarah Maslin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/nyregion/20rent.html |title=Opposing Excessive Rent, but Vague About His Own |publisher=New York Times|date=October 19, 2010 |accessdate=October 27, 2010}}</ref> The landlord of the East Village apartment is moving to evict McMillan on the grounds that McMillan lives in the Flatbush apartment and not in the East Village one; McMillan, who has held the East Village apartment lease since 1977, claims that the Flatbush apartment is not his residence but instead an office for the Rent Is Too Damn High Party.<ref>Maddux, Mitchell (August 5, 2011).

Thompson, as McMillan, kept saying \"the rent is too damn high\" in response to most of the questions put to him. He also referred to himself as a [[billy goat]] and \"the black [[Lorax]],\" and said that, if elected, he would be the country's \"last black President.\" The real McMillan praised the portrayal, saying that \"that put me over the top... this election is over.

Bullock locked herself in a room and dialed 911. Corbett pleaded no contest in 2017 and was sentenced to five years' probation for stalking Bullock and breaking into her residence. He was then subject to a ten-year protective order that required him to stay away from Bullock. After Corbett missed a court date the previous month, police officers went to his parents' residence on May 2, 2018, where he lived in a guest house, to arrest him. He refused to leave and threatened to shoot officers. A SWAT team was called and, after a five-hour standoff, they deployed gas canisters and entered the house where they found Corbett had committed suicide.

It was built by the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] (CNJ) in 1893. It is adjacent to [[NJ Transit Rail Operations|NJ Transit]]'s [[Elizabeth station]] on the [[Northeast Corridor]]. That station was built and owned by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]; in the era of private operation passengers could transfer between the two. The CNJ [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] in Elizabeth is unused, and [[passenger train]]s which served the former CNJ mainline (NJT's [[Raritan Valley Line]] service) bypass Elizabeth via the [[Aldene Connection]] on their way to [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Newark Penn Station]]. The station has been renovated and used as commercial space.\n\n==Major named trains==\nThe station was on the CNJ's main line and was also used B&O and Reading Railway trains which terminated the CNJ's [[Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal|Jersey City terminal]], where [[List of ferries across the Hudson River to New York City|ferry service to New York]] was available.\n\n*[[Baltimore and Ohio]] (routes west beyond Washington, DC):\n**''[[Capitol Limited (B&O train)|Capitol Limited]],'' ''[[Cincinnatian]],'' ''[[Columbian (B&O train)|Columbian]],'' ''[[Metropolitan Special]],'' ''[[National Limited]]'' and others\n*[[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] & [[Reading Railway]] (route to Bethlehem, Allentown, Reading and Harrisburg):\n**''Harrisburg Special'' and ''[[Queen of the Valley]]''\n*[[Reading Railway]] (route to West Trenton and Philadelphia):\n**''[[Crusader (train)|Crusader]]'' and ''Wall Street''\n\n== Status ==\nThe CNJ station suffered from a [[freight train]] wreck on November 4, 1972, when a [[boxcar]] [[derailment|derailed]] and pulled several other cars into the canopy. Although the buildings and [[freight car]]s were damaged, there were no [[injuries]].<ref name=\"wreck_1972\">{{cite web|url=http://jcrhs.org/wreck.html|title=Wreck at Elizabeth, NJ|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> The station has been listed in the [[New Jersey Register of Historic Places]] and [[National Register of Historic Places]] since 1984 and is part of the [[Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource (New Jersey)|Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource]].<ref name=\"nris\"/><ref name=NJRHP>{{cite web | title=New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places | url= http://www.nj.gov/dep/hpo/1identify/nrsr_lists.htm | publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] - Historic Preservation Office | page= | date= | accessdate= 7 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{NRHP url|id=84002656|title=Mountain Station New Jersey Transit Railroad Station Survey}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/NJ/Essex/state3.html Essex County Listings on the National Register of Historic Places (Building - #84002656)]</ref>\n\nThere are plans to redesign the public space and create a transit plaza between the CNJ and NJT stations.<ref>{{cite news      | last = Brown   | first = Douglas John   | title = Plans for NJT Elizabeth station upgrade touted   | publisher = Railway Age   | date = January 12, 2015   | url = http://www.railwayage.com/index.php/passenger/commuter-regional/plans-for-njt-elizabeth-station-upgrade-touted.html?channel=   | accessdate = January 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release   | title = CHRISTIE ADMINISTRATION UNVEILS DESIGN PLANS FOR RECONSTRUCTION OF ELIZABETH STATION   | publisher = New Jersey Transit   | date =    | url = http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=PressReleaseTo&PRESS_RELEASE_ID=2953   | accessdate = January 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web   | title = NEC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OF RELEVANCE TO NEW JERSEY   | publisher = ARP   | date = January 2013   | url = http://www.nj-arp.org/Assets/nec%20infrastructure%20projects%20of%20relevance%20to%20nj.pdf   | accessdate = January 19, 2016}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=PressReleaseTo&PRESS_RELEASE_ID=2953|title=New Jersey Transit|website=www.njtransit.com|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=CapProjectDetailsTo&CapitalProjectId=81|title=New Jersey Transit|website=www.njtransit.com|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.railway-technology.com/news/nj-transit-approves-contracts-upgrade-elizabeth-station/|title=NJ Transit approves contracts to upgrade Elizabeth Station - Railway Technology|date=April 12, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}</ref> Funding was approved in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2015/01/nj_transit_announces_55_million_redesign_of_elizabeth_station.html|title=$55 million redesign, two-story building planned for Elizabeth NJ Transit station|publisher=|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=PressReleaseTo&PRESS_RELEASE_ID=3204|title=New Jersey Transit|website=www.njtransit.com|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtands.com/passenger/commuter-regional/nj-transit-moves-forward-with-elizabeth-station-reconstruction/|title=NJ Transit moves forward with Elizabeth Station reconstruction|date=April 12, 2018|website=Railway Track and Structures}}</ref>\n\nThe proposed [[Union County Light Rail]], which would have connected midtown Elizabeth with [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]], would have had its western terminus at this station.

Israel was able to enter the contest as the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA) was an active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU), which is responsible for the event. Israel has won the contest four times, and has hosted the contest in [[Jerusalem]] twice in {{escyr|1979}} and {{escyr|1999}}. Israel hosted the contest for the third time in [[Tel Aviv]] in {{Escyr|2019}}.\n\nIsrael's first appearance at the contest in 1973 was successful, with [[Ilanit]] finishing fourth. Israel then achieved victories in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979]], with wins for [[Izhar Cohen]] and the [[Alphabeta]], with the song \"[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]\", and [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]], with \"[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]\". In {{escyr|1980}}, the IBA declined to host the contest for the second successive year for financial reasons, and as the date for the contest in [[The Hague]] conflicted with [[Yom Hazikaron]] \u2013 Israeli Memorial Day \u2013 Israel did not participate. This is the only time that the winning country did not compete the following year. The country's best results in the 1980s were the second-place finishes for [[Avi Toledano]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]] and [[Ofra Haza]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]. Former winner Izhar Cohen returned to place fifth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985]], before [[Duo Datz]] finished third in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]]. Israel achieved its third victory in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]], with [[Dana International]] and \"[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]\". [[Eden (Israeli band)|Eden]] then finished fifth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]]. As of 2019, Israel has the record for most participations and most wins in the contest without ever coming last, but it has placed second to last in the final three times, in {{escyr|1986}}, {{escyr|1993}} and {{escyr|2006}}.\n\nSince the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004, Israel has failed to reach the final six times. In {{escyr|2005}}, [[Shiri Maimon]] gave the country its tenth top five result, finishing fourth. Having failed to qualify for the final for four consecutive years (2011\u201314), Israel reached the final for the first time in five years, with [[Nadav Guedj]] finishing ninth in {{escyr|2015}}, and the country has participated in the final every year since. Israel's fourth victory came when [[Netta Barzilai|Netta]] won the {{escyr|2018}} contest in [[Lisbon]], with the song \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\".\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===Victories===\nTo date there have been four Israeli victories in the contest. [[Izhar Cohen]] and [[Alphabeta]] won in Paris in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] with the uptempo ''[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]''. On home ground in [[Jerusalem]] the following year, Israel won again, this time with the anthemic ''[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]'' performed by [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]]. Unusually, Israel did not defend the title in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]] (''see below''). The third victory came almost 20 years later in [[Birmingham]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]]. Singer [[Dana International]] took top honours with the song ''[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]'', setting off widespread celebrations in Israel. Twenty years later, Israel earned their fourth victory at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018 contest]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. The song was \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\" by [[Netta Barzilai]], which earned Israel their highest-ever score of 529 points.\n\n===Other performances===\nIsrael's earliest selections were picked by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]. The first singer to represent the country in 1973 was [[Ilanit]], who finished 4th. Criticism increased after she was sent again four years later, leading to a rule that the winner of the already established Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival would also represent Israel at the contest. The Eurovision Song Contest winners of 1978 and 1979 were selected by this method. From 1981 the selection process was handled by the [[Kdam Eurovision]] with the exceptions of 1990, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002\u20132004, 2006\u20132007 and 2010 where the selections were again picked by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]].\n\nAfter winning the contest in 1978 and 1979, the IBA was financially and logistically unable to organise the event for the second consecutive year. The organization of the festival was subsequently handed over to the Netherlands who finally agreed to stage it. Because much time had already passed, it was difficult to find a suitable date for the Song Contest. The date chosen coincided with a [[Yom Hazikaron|memorial day]] in Israel, and the country was forced to withdraw. This made Israel the only country to date unable to defend its title. The 1980 Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival therefore did not double as a national final that year unlike the last two years, and the winning song \"Pizmon Chozer\" by the band [[The Brothers & the Sisters]] was never given the chance to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. In 1984 Israel once again refrained from participating due to the same date conflict.\n\nApart from its victories, Israel's entries have had a mixed reception at the contest. [[Avi Toledano]] ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]]) and [[Ofra Haza]] ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]) scored well with big revivalist numbers, but the all-singing, all-dancing style became less popular later in the decade and Israel's 1986 entry, [[Yavo Yom]] by Moti Giladi & Sarai Tzuriel, came in 19th, the country's worst showing yet.\n\nIn 1987 Israel finished 8th with [[Shir Habatlanim]] by the satiric duo Lazy Bums. Due to its satiric nature, it prompted then Israeli Minister of Culture, [[Yitzhak Navon]], to threaten to resign, if the song went on to represent Israel on the night of the contest. However, he didn't.\n\nIn 1990 [[Rita Kleinstein|Rita's]] sensuous [[ballad]] was not well received, but in 1991, Orna and Moshe Datz finished third, Israel's best result since 1983. Israel's third victory occurred in 1998, when [[Dana International]] won the crown with her song \"[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]].\" Israel also had a 5th-place finish by [[Eden (Israeli band)|Eden]] when it hosted the 1999 contest. However, [[PingPong (band)|Ping-Pong]]'s [[disco]] effort in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]] failed badly, though the group was noted for their largely optimistic lyrics and message of reconciliation and peace in Western Asia. They went as far as waving [[Syria]]n flags at the end of their performance, angering some Israelis.\n\nIn 2004 [[David D'Or]] came in 11th in the semifinal with the song \"[[Leha'amin]]\" (\u05dc\u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05df), leaving Israel out of the finals for the first time since 1997. [[Shiri Maymon]]'s performance in Kiev in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] brought Israel back to the top five, and ensured a place in the Athens [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 final]]. In 2006, Israel was represented by singer [[Eddie Butler (singer)|Eddie Butler]], who had finished 5th as part of Eden in 1999; however, his performance of the song \"Together We Are One\" finished 23rd, with just four points.\n\n[[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]]'s Eurovision committee chose the band [[Teapacks]] to represent Israel in the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Final in Helsinki.  Their humorous entry \"Push the Button\" did not fare well, finishing in 24th place out of a semifinal field of 28 and failing to reach the final. Israel had to compete in the semi-final in Belgrade 2008, from which it passed on to the final; [[Boaz Mauda|Boaz]] finished ninth. At the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], an Arab citizen of Israel represented the country for the first time, as [[Mira Awad]] performed along with Jewish-Israeli singer [[Achinoam Nini|Noa]] in Moscow. Israel was represented in 2010 by [[Harel Skaat]], who came in 14th in the final.\n\nIsrael's participations from 2011 to 2014 were less successful, as former Eurovision winner [[Dana International]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the band [[Izabo]] in [[Baku]], [[Moran Mazor]] in [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[Mei Finegold]] in [[Copenhagen]], all failed to qualify for the final. However, 16-year-old [[Nadav Guedj]] qualified with Golden Boy in 2015, the first Israeli song without a [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]] lyric. Prior to their fourth win, they also managed to qualify in 2016 with [[Hovi Star]] and \"[[Made of Stars]]\" (which finished 14th) and in 2017 with [[Imri Ziv]] and \"[[I Feel Alive]]\" (which finished 23rd, Israel's lowest score in a Eurovision final since 2006). In 2019 as host country Israel was pre-qualified for the final, however, they eventually finished 23rd, Israel's lowest score in a Eurovision final since 2017), making it the fourth time since 2015 that the host country ranked in the bottom five.\n\nIn early 2020, it was confirmed that the 2020 season of ''HaKokhav HaBa'' would be the last time it would be used to select the Israeli entrant, with a separate national final to select the winning artist's Eurovision entry. Beginning in 2021, a new national final hosted by [[Lucy Ayoub]] is planned to select the Israeli entry.\n\n== Contestants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FC3\"|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#CCC\"|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#C96\"|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n<!--|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FE8080\"|\u25c1\n|Last place-->\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#A4EAA9\"|{{center|'''X'''}}\n|Entry selected but did not compete \n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1973}}\n|[[Ilanit]]\n|[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]\n|\"[[Ey Sham]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|4 \n|align=center|97\n|rowspan=\"7\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1974}}\n|[[Kaveret]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Natati La Khayay]]\" {{small|(\u05e0\u05ea\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|11 \n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1975}}\n|[[Shlomo Artzi]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[At Va'Ani]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|11\n|align=center|40\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1976}}\n|[[Chocolate, Menta, Mastik]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Emor Shalom]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05de\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|6\n|align=center|77\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1977}}\n|Ilanit\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ahava Hi Shir Lishnayim]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|11 \n|align=center|49\n|-style=\"background:gold;\"\n!{{Escyr|1978}}\n|[[Izhar Cohen]] and the [[Alphabeta]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]\" {{small|(\u05d0-\u05d1-\u05e0\u05d9-\u05d1\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|1 \n|align=center|157\n|-style=\"background:gold;\"\n!{{Escyr|1979}}\n|[[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]\" {{small|(\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|125\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1980}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1981}}\n|[[Hakol Over Habibi]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Halayla]]\" {{small|(\u05d4\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|56\n|rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1982}}\n|[[Avi Toledano]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Hora (song)|Hora]]\" {{small|(\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|100\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1983}}\n|[[Ofra Haza]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Hi (Ofra Haza song)|Hi]]\" {{small|(\u05d7\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|2 \n|align=center|136\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1984}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1985}}\n|Izhar Cohen\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9 (song)|Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9]]\" {{small|(\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4, \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|5 \n|align=center|93\n|rowspan=\"8\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1986}}\n|Moti Giladi & Sarai Tzuriel\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Yavo Yom]]\" {{small|(\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|19 \n|align=center|7\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1987}}\n|Lazy Bums\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Shir Habatlanim]]\" {{small|(\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd)}}\t\n|align=center|8 \n|align=center|73\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1988}}\n|[[Yardena Arazi]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ben Adam]]\" {{small|(\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|85\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1989}}\n|Gili & Galit\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Derekh Hamelekh]]\" {{small|(\u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05da)}}\n|align=center|12 \n|align=center|50\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1990}}\n|[[Rita Kleinstein|Rita]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Shara Barkhovot]]\" {{small|(\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea)}}\n|align=center|18 \n|align=center|16\n|-style=\"background:#c96;\"\n!{{Escyr|1991}}\n|[[Duo Datz]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Kan (song)|Kan]]\" {{small|(\u05db\u05d0\u05df)}}\n|align=center|3 \n|align=center|139\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1992}}\n|[[Dafna Dekel]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ze Rak Sport]]\" {{small|(\u05d6\u05d4 \u05e8\u05e7 \u05e1\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d8)}}\t\n|align=center|6 \n|align=center|85\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1993}}\n|Sarah'le Sharon & [[The Shiru Group]]\n|Hebrew, [[English language|English]]\n|\"[[Shiru]]\" {{small|(\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5)}}\n|align=center|24 \n|align=center|4\n|colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|[[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet]]}}\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1994}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1995}}\n|Liora\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Amen (Liora song)|Amen]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05de\u05df)}}\n|align=center|8 \n|align=center|81\n|colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1996}}}}{{Efn|Israel failed to qualify for the 1996 contest.

When it became apparent during the later stages of the voting sequence that Israel was going to win the contest, JRTV abruptly ended the transmission.<ref name=\"50yrs\">{{cite book|last = O'Connor|first = John Kennedy|year = 2005|title = The Eurovision Song Contest 50 Years The Official History|publisher=Carlton Books Limited|location = London|isbn = 1-84442-586-X}}</ref> Afterwards, the Jordanian news media refused to acknowledge the fact that Israel had won, and announced that the winner was Belgium (which had actually come in second).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=esctoday.com|year=2005|url=http://www.esctoday.com/annual/1978/participants.php|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1978|accessdate=8 May 2007}}</ref> By coincidence, Israel did not broadcast the victory either, as the IBA did not buy enough broadcasting time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The victory was broadcast the next day.\n\nAt the time, Israeli Television was in its infancy and broadcasting in black & white. Many/most Israelis therefore watched international events in colour, using the signal from neighbouring Jordan. As Jordan did not broadcast the Israeli entry and the IBA did not broadcast the results part of the event, the win only became known as a result of radio broadcasts.\n\nBecause of Israel's participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], many [[Arab]] states that are eligible to participate do not do so. [[Tunisia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Tunisia]], [[Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Morocco]], and [[Lebanon in the Eurovision Song Contest|Lebanon]] are cases in point.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for Morocco and Tunisia not participating due to Israel|date=October 2013}} Tunisia was about to participate in 1977, but decided not to do so in the end; Lebanon was just about to participate in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] when it withdrew (incurring a fine by the EBU) because Lebanese law does not allow recognition of Israel, and consequently Lebanese television would not transmit any Israeli material \u2013 which would have been a violation of the EBU's rules.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]]|date=18 March 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4362373.stm|title=Lebanon withdraws from Eurovision|accessdate=15 July 2006}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Music of Israel]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Israel in Eurovision}}\n{{Eurovision Song Contest}}\n{{Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits}}\n\n[[Category:Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest| ]]\n[[Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox song contest country\n| Name = Israel\n| Member station = [[Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation|Kan]]\n{{Collapsible list\n | title = '''Former members''' \n | '''1973\u20132017:''' [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]]\n}}\n| National selection event = \n{{Collapsible list\n | title = '''Internal selection'''\n | 1973\u20131977\n | 1988 (artist)\n | 1990\n | 1998\u20132000\n | 2002\u20132004\n | 2007\n | 2012\n | 2015 (song)\n | 2017\u20132019 (song)\n | 2021\n}}\n{{Collapsible list\n | title = '''National final'''\n | '''Israel Song Festival'''\n | 1978\u20131979\n | '''[[Kdam Eurovision]]'''\n | 1981\u20131983\n | 1985\u20131987\n | 1988 (song)\n | 1989\n | 1991\u20131993\n | 1995\u20131996\n | 2001\n | 2005\u20132006\n | 2008\u20132011\n | 2013\u20132014\n | '''[[HaKokhav HaBa]]'''\n | 2015 (artist)\n | 2016\n | 2017-2019 (artist)\n}}\n| ESC apps = 42 (36 finals)\n| ESC first = {{Escyr|1973}}\n| ESC best = 1st: {{Escyr|1978}}, {{Escyr|1979}}, {{Escyr|1998}}, {{Escyr|2018}}\n| ESC worst = 24th {{small|SF}}: {{Escyr|2007}}\n| Website = [https://www.kan.org.il/page.aspx?landingpageId=7 Kan page]\n| EBU page = https://eurovision.tv/country/israel\n| Current = 2019\n}}\n\n'''[[Israel]]''' has participated in the '''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]''' 42 times since making its debut in {{Escyr|1973}}. Israel was able to enter the contest as the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA) was an active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU), which is responsible for the event. Israel has won the contest four times, and has hosted the contest in [[Jerusalem]] twice in {{escyr|1979}} and {{escyr|1999}}. Israel hosted the contest for the third time in [[Tel Aviv]] in {{Escyr|2019}}.\n\nIsrael's first appearance at the contest in 1973 was successful, with [[Ilanit]] finishing fourth. Israel then achieved victories in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979]], with wins for [[Izhar Cohen]] and the [[Alphabeta]], with the song \"[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]\", and [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]], with \"[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]\". In {{escyr|1980}}, the IBA declined to host the contest for the second successive year for financial reasons, and as the date for the contest in [[The Hague]] conflicted with [[Yom Hazikaron]] \u2013 Israeli Memorial Day \u2013 Israel did not participate. This is the only time that the winning country did not compete the following year. The country's best results in the 1980s were the second-place finishes for [[Avi Toledano]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]] and [[Ofra Haza]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]. Former winner Izhar Cohen returned to place fifth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985]], before [[Duo Datz]] finished third in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]]. Israel achieved its third victory in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]], with [[Dana International]] and \"[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]\". [[Eden (Israeli band)|Eden]] then finished fifth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]]. As of 2019, Israel has the record for most participations and most wins in the contest without ever coming last, but it has placed second to last in the final three times, in {{escyr|1986}}, {{escyr|1993}} and {{escyr|2006}}.\n\nSince the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004, Israel has failed to reach the final six times. In {{escyr|2005}}, [[Shiri Maimon]] gave the country its tenth top five result, finishing fourth. Having failed to qualify for the final for four consecutive years (2011\u201314), Israel reached the final for the first time in five years, with [[Nadav Guedj]] finishing ninth in {{escyr|2015}}, and the country has participated in the final every year since. Israel's fourth victory came when [[Netta Barzilai|Netta]] won the {{escyr|2018}} contest in [[Lisbon]], with the song \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\".\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===Victories===\nTo date there have been four Israeli victories in the contest. [[Izhar Cohen]] and [[Alphabeta]] won in Paris in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] with the uptempo ''[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]''. On home ground in [[Jerusalem]] the following year, Israel won again, this time with the anthemic ''[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]'' performed by [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]]. Unusually, Israel did not defend the title in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]] (''see below''). The third victory came almost 20 years later in [[Birmingham]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]]. Singer [[Dana International]] took top honours with the song ''[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]'', setting off widespread celebrations in Israel. Twenty years later, Israel earned their fourth victory at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018 contest]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. The song was \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\" by [[Netta Barzilai]], which earned Israel their highest-ever score of 529 points.\n\n===Other performances===\nIsrael's earliest selections were picked by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]. The first singer to represent the country in 1973 was [[Ilanit]], who finished 4th. Criticism increased after she was sent again four years later, leading to a rule that the winner of the already established Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival would also represent Israel at the contest. The Eurovision Song Contest winners of 1978 and 1979 were selected by this method. From 1981 the selection process was handled by the [[Kdam Eurovision]] with the exceptions of 1990, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002\u20132004, 2006\u20132007 and 2010 where the selections were again picked by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]].\n\nAfter winning the contest in 1978 and 1979, the IBA was financially and logistically unable to organise the event for the second consecutive year. The organization of the festival was subsequently handed over to the Netherlands who finally agreed to stage it. Because much time had already passed, it was difficult to find a suitable date for the Song Contest. The date chosen coincided with a [[Yom Hazikaron|memorial day]] in Israel, and the country was forced to withdraw. This made Israel the only country to date unable to defend its title. The 1980 Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival therefore did not double as a national final that year unlike the last two years, and the winning song \"Pizmon Chozer\" by the band [[The Brothers & the Sisters]] was never given the chance to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. In 1984 Israel once again refrained from participating due to the same date conflict.\n\nApart from its victories, Israel's entries have had a mixed reception at the contest. [[Avi Toledano]] ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]]) and [[Ofra Haza]] ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]) scored well with big revivalist numbers, but the all-singing, all-dancing style became less popular later in the decade and Israel's 1986 entry, [[Yavo Yom]] by Moti Giladi & Sarai Tzuriel, came in 19th, the country's worst showing yet.\n\nIn 1987 Israel finished 8th with [[Shir Habatlanim]] by the satiric duo Lazy Bums. Due to its satiric nature, it prompted then Israeli Minister of Culture, [[Yitzhak Navon]], to threaten to resign, if the song went on to represent Israel on the night of the contest. However, he didn't.\n\nIn 1990 [[Rita Kleinstein|Rita's]] sensuous [[ballad]] was not well received, but in 1991, Orna and Moshe Datz finished third, Israel's best result since 1983. Israel's third victory occurred in 1998, when [[Dana International]] won the crown with her song \"[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]].\" Israel also had a 5th-place finish by [[Eden (Israeli band)|Eden]] when it hosted the 1999 contest. However, [[PingPong (band)|Ping-Pong]]'s [[disco]] effort in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]] failed badly, though the group was noted for their largely optimistic lyrics and message of reconciliation and peace in Western Asia. They went as far as waving [[Syria]]n flags at the end of their performance, angering some Israelis.\n\nIn 2004 [[David D'Or]] came in 11th in the semifinal with the song \"[[Leha'amin]]\" (\u05dc\u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05df), leaving Israel out of the finals for the first time since 1997. [[Shiri Maymon]]'s performance in Kiev in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] brought Israel back to the top five, and ensured a place in the Athens [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 final]]. In 2006, Israel was represented by singer [[Eddie Butler (singer)|Eddie Butler]], who had finished 5th as part of Eden in 1999; however, his performance of the song \"Together We Are One\" finished 23rd, with just four points.\n\n[[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]]'s Eurovision committee chose the band [[Teapacks]] to represent Israel in the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Final in Helsinki.  Their humorous entry \"Push the Button\" did not fare well, finishing in 24th place out of a semifinal field of 28 and failing to reach the final. Israel had to compete in the semi-final in Belgrade 2008, from which it passed on to the final; [[Boaz Mauda|Boaz]] finished ninth. At the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], an Arab citizen of Israel represented the country for the first time, as [[Mira Awad]] performed along with Jewish-Israeli singer [[Achinoam Nini|Noa]] in Moscow. Israel was represented in 2010 by [[Harel Skaat]], who came in 14th in the final.\n\nIsrael's participations from 2011 to 2014 were less successful, as former Eurovision winner [[Dana International]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the band [[Izabo]] in [[Baku]], [[Moran Mazor]] in [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[Mei Finegold]] in [[Copenhagen]], all failed to qualify for the final. However, 16-year-old [[Nadav Guedj]] qualified with Golden Boy in 2015, the first Israeli song without a [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]] lyric. Prior to their fourth win, they also managed to qualify in 2016 with [[Hovi Star]] and \"[[Made of Stars]]\" (which finished 14th) and in 2017 with [[Imri Ziv]] and \"[[I Feel Alive]]\" (which finished 23rd, Israel's lowest score in a Eurovision final since 2006). In 2019 as host country Israel was pre-qualified for the final, however, they eventually finished 23rd, Israel's lowest score in a Eurovision final since 2017), making it the fourth time since 2015 that the host country ranked in the bottom five.\n\nIn early 2020, it was confirmed that the 2020 season of ''HaKokhav HaBa'' would be the last time it would be used to select the Israeli entrant, with a separate national final to select the winning artist's Eurovision entry. Beginning in 2021, a new national final hosted by [[Lucy Ayoub]] is planned to select the Israeli entry.\n\n== Contestants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FC3\"|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#CCC\"|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#C96\"|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n<!--|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FE8080\"|\u25c1\n|Last place-->\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#A4EAA9\"|{{center|'''X'''}}\n|Entry selected but did not compete \n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1973}}\n|[[Ilanit]]\n|[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]\n|\"[[Ey Sham]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|4 \n|align=center|97\n|rowspan=\"7\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1974}}\n|[[Kaveret]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Natati La Khayay]]\" {{small|(\u05e0\u05ea\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d4 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|11 \n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1975}}\n|[[Shlomo Artzi]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[At Va'Ani]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|11\n|align=center|40\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1976}}\n|[[Chocolate, Menta, Mastik]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Emor Shalom]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05de\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|6\n|align=center|77\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1977}}\n|Ilanit\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ahava Hi Shir Lishnayim]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|11 \n|align=center|49\n|-style=\"background:gold;\"\n!{{Escyr|1978}}\n|[[Izhar Cohen]] and the [[Alphabeta]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]\" {{small|(\u05d0-\u05d1-\u05e0\u05d9-\u05d1\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|1 \n|align=center|157\n|-style=\"background:gold;\"\n!{{Escyr|1979}}\n|[[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]\" {{small|(\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|125\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1980}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1981}}\n|[[Hakol Over Habibi]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Halayla]]\" {{small|(\u05d4\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|56\n|rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1982}}\n|[[Avi Toledano]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Hora (song)|Hora]]\" {{small|(\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|100\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1983}}\n|[[Ofra Haza]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Hi (Ofra Haza song)|Hi]]\" {{small|(\u05d7\u05d9)}}\n|align=center|2 \n|align=center|136\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1984}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1985}}\n|Izhar Cohen\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9 (song)|Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9]]\" {{small|(\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4, \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4)}}\n|align=center|5 \n|align=center|93\n|rowspan=\"8\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1986}}\n|Moti Giladi & Sarai Tzuriel\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Yavo Yom]]\" {{small|(\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|19 \n|align=center|7\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1987}}\n|Lazy Bums\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Shir Habatlanim]]\" {{small|(\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d8\u05dc\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd)}}\t\n|align=center|8 \n|align=center|73\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1988}}\n|[[Yardena Arazi]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ben Adam]]\" {{small|(\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd)}}\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|85\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1989}}\n|Gili & Galit\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Derekh Hamelekh]]\" {{small|(\u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05da)}}\n|align=center|12 \n|align=center|50\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1990}}\n|[[Rita Kleinstein|Rita]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Shara Barkhovot]]\" {{small|(\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea)}}\n|align=center|18 \n|align=center|16\n|-style=\"background:#c96;\"\n!{{Escyr|1991}}\n|[[Duo Datz]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Kan (song)|Kan]]\" {{small|(\u05db\u05d0\u05df)}}\n|align=center|3 \n|align=center|139\n|-\t \n!{{Escyr|1992}}\n|[[Dafna Dekel]]\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Ze Rak Sport]]\" {{small|(\u05d6\u05d4 \u05e8\u05e7 \u05e1\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d8)}}\t\n|align=center|6 \n|align=center|85\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1993}}\n|Sarah'le Sharon & [[The Shiru Group]]\n|Hebrew, [[English language|English]]\n|\"[[Shiru]]\" {{small|(\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5)}}\n|align=center|24 \n|align=center|4\n|colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|[[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet]]}}\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1994}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1995}}\n|Liora\n|Hebrew\n|\"[[Amen (Liora song)|Amen]]\" {{small|(\u05d0\u05de\u05df)}}\n|align=center|8 \n|align=center|81\n|colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1996}}}}{{Efn|Israel failed to qualify for the 1996 contest.

The northern part of the [[urban park]] is a grassed area. In the middle section is a [[skatepark]]. The southern part of the park is a children's [[playground]] and also includes two cafes, public lavatories, a pavilion which can be hired for community use, a pond with a fountain, a sensory garden and a zone for [[boccia]] and [[p\u00e9tanque]].<ref name=\"BHCC\" /><ref name=\"LUC\" />\n\n[[Brighton and Hove City Council]] added The Level to their Local List of Heritage Assets in 2015.

In 1822 the cricket ground moved to a nearby site called the Hanover Ground; after another move to the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] on the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]], it was established on its present site on Eaton Road in Hove in 1872.<ref name=\"Seldon62\"/> The Bat and Ball pub on Ditchling Road, facing the west side of The Level, commemorates the ground.<ref name=\"NEB176\"/> Other popular events included the town's annual bonfire celebrations on [[Guy Fawkes Night]], regular circuses and fairs, and traditional activities such as [[bat and trap]]<ref name=\"NEB176\"/> and skipping. Writing in 1883, a contributor to the ''[[Sussex Archaeological Society|Sussex Archaeological Collections]]'' journal noted that the local [[Good Friday]] tradition of skipping was still maintained at The Level, where \"scores of skippers\" could be seen.<ref name=\"Underwood24\">{{Harvnb|Underwood|1978|p=24.}}</ref>\n\nAs well as these informal recreational events, The Level (especially the southern part, closest to the town centre) was used for formal, town-wide events and commemorations, such as the Prince's birthday celebrations.<ref name=\"Fines25\"/> The [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Allied Powers']] defeat of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was celebrated in Brighton by the Great Peace Festival of August 1814.

The shortest and most direct, covering {{convert|47.5|mi|km}} but requiring the most expensive construction work, would have terminated just north of The Level on the site of James Ireland's pleasure gardens.<ref name=\"OOB133\">{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1975|p=133.}}</ref> After [[Brighton main line|a line]] was built slightly further west in 1841, Brighton's population grew rapidly and its character changed.<ref name=\"NEB268\">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=268.}}</ref> One feature of the mid- to late 19th century was a rapid growth in prostitution; it was common at The Level, when at night \"the scenes ... were said to beggar all description\".<ref name=\"OOB196\">{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1975|p=196.}}</ref> A police station was established in a small building at the southern end of the park in 1865.

Among the regular events held there was the annual May Day rally and demonstration by the Brighton Trades Council, which was formed in 1890. These events \"became well known nationally\"; members included [[Margaret Bondfield]], who was employed as a draper's assistant in Brighton at the time and who later became the first female [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet minister in the United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Fines78\">{{Harvnb|Fines|2002|p=78.}}</ref> Later, local resident [[Harry Cowley]] was an organiser of the barrow boys\u2014many of whom had been in the armed forces during World War I\u2014on nearby Oxford Street. In the early 1920s he negotiated permission for them to sell fruit and vegetables alongside the rose garden on The Level.

In the past, the land has been used as a [[Ground (cricket)|cricket ground]] for the [[Prince of Wales]] and as a setting for huge dinner parties to commemorate events such as the defeat of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and the coronation of [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nPresent day features of the Level include a grassed area with [[elm trees]] and outdoor seating, several caf\u00e9s, a [[skatepark]], a rose garden, a children's [[playground]] and a pond.

The northern part of the [[urban park]] is a grassed area. In the middle section is a [[skatepark]]. The southern part of the park is a children's [[playground]] and also includes two cafes, public lavatories, a pavilion which can be hired for community use, a pond with a fountain, a sensory garden and a zone for [[boccia]] and [[p\u00e9tanque]].<ref name=\"BHCC\" /><ref name=\"LUC\" />\n\n[[Brighton and Hove City Council]] added The Level to their Local List of Heritage Assets in 2015.

In 1822 the cricket ground moved to a nearby site called the Hanover Ground; after another move to the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] on the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]], it was established on its present site on Eaton Road in Hove in 1872.<ref name=\"Seldon62\"/>  The Bat and Ball pub on Ditchling Road, facing the west side of The Level, commemorates the ground.<ref name=\"NEB176\"/>  Other popular events included the town's annual bonfire celebrations on [[Guy Fawkes Night]], regular circuses and fairs, and traditional activities such as [[bat and trap]]<ref name=\"NEB176\"/> and skipping.

Among the regular events held there was the annual May Day rally and demonstration by the Brighton Trades Council, which was formed in 1890.

The city used to be known during that time as the best in gold and boat manufacturing in the entire Philippine archipelago, having traded with as far as Champa, Ming, Srivijaya, Majapahit, and the Bengali coasts. It is located at the northeastern part of the Agusan Valley, [[Mindanao]], sprawling across the [[Agusan River]]. It is bounded to the north, west and south by [[Agusan del Norte]], to the east by [[Agusan del Sur]] and to the northwest by [[Butuan Bay]].\n\nButuan City was the capital of the province of [[Agusan del Norte]] until 2000, when Republic Act 8811 transferred the capital to [[Cabadbaran City]]. For statistical and geographical purposes, Butuan City is grouped with Agusan del Norte but governed administratively independent from the province while legislatively administered by the province's 1st congressional district.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Butuan\" is believed to have originated from the sour fruit locally called ''[[garcinia morella|batuan]]''. Other [[etymology|etymological]] sources say that it comes from a certain [[Datu]] Buntuan, a chieftain who once ruled over areas of the present-day city.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAccording to Datu Makalipay, Butuan was named after the wife of Datu Balansag who was the ''tiniente de barangay'' of the area before.\n\n==History==\n\n===Old Butuan===\n{{Main|Rajahnate of Butuan}}\n[[File:Butuan Ivory Seal.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.75|The [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], housed and displayed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]].]]\n\nButuan, during the pre-colonial times, was known as the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]], an [[Indianized kingdom]] known for its [[metallurgy|metallurgic industry]] and sophisticated naval technology. The rajahnate flourished at the 10th and 11th centuries CE, and had an extensive trade network with the [[Champa|Champa civilisation]] and the [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya Empire]].<ref name=\"philippinealmanac.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701082957/http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |archivedate=2012-07-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2071/ |title=Butuan Archeological Sites |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref>\n\nBy 1001, the rajahnate had established contact with the [[Song dynasty]] of [[China]]. The ''[[History of Song]]'' recorded the appearance of a Butuan mission at the [[Chinese imperial court]], and the rajahnate was described as a small [[Hinduism|Hindu]] country with a [[Theravada Buddhism|Buddhist]] monarchy, which had a regular trade connection with [[Champa]]. The mission, under a king named \"Kiling\", asked for equal status in court protocol with the Champa envoy, but ultimately was denied by the imperial court.<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline of history |url=http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm |accessdate=2009-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123061819/http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm |archivedate=2009-11-23 }}</ref><ref>[[William Henry Scott (historian)|Scott, William]] ''Prehispanic Source Materials: For the Study of Philippine History'', p. 66</ref> However, under the reign of Sri Bata Shaja, the diplomatic equality was eventually granted to the kingdom, and as a result the diplomatic relations of the two nations reached its peak in the [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref>''Song Shi'' Chapter 7 to 8</ref>\n\nEvidence of these trading links are in the discovery of 11 [[balangay]] boats around Ambangan in [[Barangay]] Libertad, which was described as the only concentration of archaeological, ancient, ocean-going boats in [[Southeast Asia]]. Other evidences of the post are the discovery of a village in Libertad that specializes in gold, deformed skulls similar to reports in [[Sulawesi]], and the discovery of many artifacts by locals and [[treasure hunting|treasure hunters]].\n\n===Colonial period===\nOn March 31, 1521, an [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]] ordered a [[Catholic mass|mass]] to be celebrated. This was officiated by Friar Pedro Valderrama, the [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] [[chaplain]] of the fleet, the only priest then. Another priest, the French Bernard Calmette (Bernardo Calmeta) had been [[marooning|marooned]] at [[Patagonia]] with Juan de Cartagena for being implicated in the mutiny at [[Puerto San Juli\u00e1n]]. Conducted near the shores of the island, the ''Holy First Mass'' marked the birth of [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines]]. [[Rajah]] Colambu and Siaiu were said to be among the first natives of the soon-to-be [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish colony]] to attend the mass among other Mazaua inhabitants, together with visitors from Butuan who came with the entourage of Colambu, king of Butuan.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nControversy has been generated regarding the holding of the first mass\u2014whether it was held in [[Limasawa]], [[Leyte]] in Masao, Butuan City, in the hidden isle made up of [[barangays]] Pinamanculan and Bancasi inside Butuan, in the latest discovered site in between [[Agusan del Sur]] and [[Surigao del Sur]], the small barangay of Barobo, or elsewhere. It is sure, however, that Ferdinand Magellan did not drop anchor by the mouth of [[Agusan River]] in 1521 and hold mass to commemorate the event which was held at Mazaua, an island separate from 1521 Butuan which, in the geographical conception of Europeans who wrote about it, was a larger entity than what it is now.

The plentiful trees of the area invited many investors to the city, and inspired then-[[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Congressman]] Marcos M. Calo to file a bill elevating Butuan for cityhood. On August 2, 1950, this was passed, converting Butuan into a [[cities of the Philippines|city]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra523-butuan-city-charter.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712043612/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra523-butuan-city-charter.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=R.A.

The city's main income by that time frame and until this day depended on small and medium business, and large-scale projects by investors. On February 7, 1995, the city was reclassified from a chartered city to a Highly Urbanized city. Sixteen days later, on February 23, the region of [[Caraga]] was created by virtue of Republic Act 7901, with Butuan as its regional center, and the provincial capital of [[Agusan del Norte]]. In 2000, Republic Act 8811 formally transferred the capital of Agusan del Norte from Butuan to [[Cabadbaran]], however most provincial offices are still located in the city.\n\n==Geography==\n\nButuan City has a land area of {{convert|81662|ha}}, which is roughly 4.1% of the total area of the [[Caraga]] region.\n\nThe existing land use of the city consists of the following uses: agriculture areas (397.23&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), forestland (268&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), grass/shrub/pasture land (61.14&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and other uses (90.242&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Of the total forestland, 105&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is production forest areas while 167.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is protection forest areas.\n\nThe forestland, as mentioned earlier, comprised both the production and protection forest. The classified forest is further specified as production forest and protection forest. In the production forest industrial tree species are mostly grown in the area. The protection forest on the other hand, is preserved to support and sustain necessary ecological performance. Included in this are the watershed areas in Taguibo, which is the main source of water in the area,\n\nThe city is endowed with swamplands near its coastal area. These swamp areas are interconnected with the waterways joined by the Agusan River. Most of the swamplands are actually mangroves that served as habitat to different marine species.\n\nFilling material needs of the city are extracted usually from the riverbank of Taguibo River. Others are sourced out from promontories with special features and for special purpose.\n\nThe fishing ground of Butuan is the Butuan Bay of which two coastal barangays are located. It extends some two kilometers to the sea and joins the Bohol Sea. These are the barangays of Lumbocan and Masao.\n\n===Climate===\nButuan has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Af'').\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Butuan, Agusan del Norte (1981\u20132010, extremes 1980\u20132012)\n| metric first = Y\n| single line = Y\n| Jan record high C = 35.4\n| Feb record high C = 35.3\n| Mar record high C = 35.8\n| Apr record high C = 37.8\n| May record high C = 37.8\n| Jun record high C = 37.6\n| Jul record high C = 37.7\n| Aug record high C = 36.1\n| Sep record high C = 36.4\n| Oct record high C = 36.3\n| Nov record high C = 35.5\n| Dec record high C = 35.2\n|year record high C = 37.8\n| Jan high C = 30.2\n| Feb high C = 30.8\n| Mar high C = 31.8\n| Apr high C = 33.1\n| May high C = 33.7\n| Jun high C = 33.1\n| Jul high C = 32.6\n| Aug high C = 32.9\n| Sep high C = 32.9\n| Oct high C = 32.4\n| Nov high C = 31.7\n| Dec high C = 30.8\n| year high C = 32.2\n| Jan mean C = 26.3\n| Feb mean C = 26.6\n| Mar mean C = 27.3\n| Apr mean C = 28.3\n| May mean C = 28.9\n| Jun mean C = 28.5\n| Jul mean C = 28.2\n| Aug mean C = 28.4\n| Sep mean C = 28.3\n| Oct mean C = 28.0\n| Nov mean C = 27.5\n| Dec mean C = 26.9\n| year mean C = 27.8\n| Jan low C = 22.5\n| Feb low C = 22.5\n| Mar low C = 22.8\n| Apr low C = 23.5\n| May low C = 24.2\n| Jun low C = 24.0\n| Jul low C = 23.7\n| Aug low C = 23.9\n| Sep low C = 23.7\n| Oct low C = 23.6\n| Nov low C = 23.4\n| Dec low C = 22.9\n| year low C = 23.4\n| Jan record low C = 18.3\n| Feb record low C = 17.5\n| Mar record low C = 18.5\n| Apr record low C = 20.0\n| May record low C = 18.0\n| Jun record low C = 18.5\n| Jul record low C = 17.5\n| Aug record low C = 19.0\n| Sep record low C = 19.0\n| Oct record low C = 20.0\n| Nov record low C = 18.5\n| Dec record low C = 18.5\n|year record low C = 17.5\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 318.0\n| Feb rain mm = 225.0\n| Mar rain mm = 145.4\n| Apr rain mm = 109.7\n| May rain mm = 115.5\n| Jun rain mm = 154.0\n| Jul rain mm = 143.9\n| Aug rain mm = 105.6\n| Sep rain mm = 126.3\n| Oct rain mm = 178.4\n| Nov rain mm = 197.9\n| Dec rain mm = 238.2\n|year rain mm = 2057.8\n| unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan rain days = 21\n| Feb rain days = 16\n| Mar rain days = 16\n| Apr rain days = 13\n| May rain days = 14\n| Jun rain days = 17\n| Jul rain days = 16\n| Aug rain days = 13\n| Sep rain days = 14\n| Oct rain days = 16\n| Nov rain days = 18\n| Dec rain days = 20\n|year rain days = 194\n| Jan humidity = 88\n| Feb humidity = 85\n| Mar humidity = 84\n| Apr humidity = 82\n| May humidity = 82\n| Jun humidity = 83\n| Jul humidity = 84\n| Aug humidity = 82\n| Sep humidity = 82\n| Oct humidity = 84\n| Nov humidity = 86\n| Dec humidity = 88\n| year humidity = 84\n| source 1 = [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]]<ref name=PAGASAnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008043243/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasanormvalbutuanagdelnorte1981-2010.csv\n| archivedate = 8 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-normal-values/resource/df060d16-4cae-4180-b14a-e18b23f55ec7\n| title = Butuan, Agusan del Norte Climatological Normal Values\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 8 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=PAGASAextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008043321/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasaclimextrbutagusdelnorte.csv\n| archivedate = 8 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-extremes/resource/f5fb5f53-c75f-4880-83d9-23d2bced4c54\n| title = Butuan, Agusan del Norte Climatological Extremes\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 8 October 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Barangays===\nButuan is subdivided into 86 [[barangay]]s and group into 13 districts.<ref>Butuan City District and Barangays [http://butuan.gov.ph/page/district-and-barangayl \"Butuan City District and Barangays\"]</ref> Also, barangays 1 thru 26 form the [[Poblacion]] (city proper) of Butuan City.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;background-color:white;text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:top;\" \n!

It is customary for any traveler to learn a little bit of history concerning the place that will be visited, and the history of Butuan City is one of the most fascinating. Unlike other lands whose development only began during the Spanish colonization, Butuan was already a progressive and full fledge city centuries before the arrival of the Spaniards. Historical records show that as early as the 10th century, the local people were already engaged in trade and commerce with other nations and cultures, like the Champa (now Vietnam) and the Srivajaya peoples of Java, Indonesia. This is confirmed by the unearthing of several artifacts such as boats used for plying their trade. During the Spanish and American occupation, Butuan continued to make progress and the number of people who were settling increased steadily. A large number of its inhabitants were converted to Christianity, and in fact one of the issues is whether the first mass was actually held in the city.\n\n==Festivities and annual celebrations==\n{{Travel guide|1=section|date=June 2016}}\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | width1 = 237\n | image1 = Robinsons Place Butuan Main Facade, Kahimunan Festival 2018 (Original Work).jpg\n | alt1 = \n | width2 = 200\n | image2 = Kahimunan Festival Contingent.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | footer = Contingents from Mati NHS (Left) and a Festival Queen (Right) during Kahimunan Festival\n}}\n;Kahimunan Festival:The Kahimunan Festival<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.driftstories.com/kahimunan-festival-2019-experience/|title=A Gathering Under The Rain: Kahimunan Festival 2019|last=Kikoy|first=Herbert|date=2019-01-26|website=Drift Stories|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> is celebrated every third Sunday of January in celebration of the city patron [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Sr. Santo Ni\u00f1o]].

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nIt served as the former capital of the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] before 1001 until 1756. The city used to be known during that time as the best in gold and boat manufacturing in the entire Philippine archipelago, having traded with as far as Champa, Ming, Srivijaya, Majapahit, and the Bengali coasts. It is located at the northeastern part of the Agusan Valley, [[Mindanao]], sprawling across the [[Agusan River]]. It is bounded to the north, west and south by [[Agusan del Norte]], to the east by [[Agusan del Sur]] and to the northwest by [[Butuan Bay]].\n\nButuan City was the capital of the province of [[Agusan del Norte]] until 2000, when Republic Act 8811 transferred the capital to [[Cabadbaran City]]. For statistical and geographical purposes, Butuan City is grouped with Agusan del Norte but governed administratively independent from the province while legislatively administered by the province's 1st congressional district.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Butuan\" is believed to have originated from the sour fruit locally called ''[[garcinia morella|batuan]]''. Other [[etymology|etymological]] sources say that it comes from a certain [[Datu]] Buntuan, a chieftain who once ruled over areas of the present-day city.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAccording to Datu Makalipay, Butuan was named after the wife of Datu Balansag who was the ''tiniente de barangay'' of the area before.\n\n==History==\n\n===Old Butuan===\n{{Main|Rajahnate of Butuan}}\n[[File:Butuan Ivory Seal.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.75|The [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], housed and displayed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]].]]\n\nButuan, during the pre-colonial times, was known as the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]], an [[Indianized kingdom]] known for its [[metallurgy|metallurgic industry]] and sophisticated naval technology. The rajahnate flourished at the 10th and 11th centuries CE, and had an extensive trade network with the [[Champa|Champa civilisation]] and the [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya Empire]].<ref name=\"philippinealmanac.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701082957/http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |archivedate=2012-07-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2071/ |title=Butuan Archeological Sites |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref>\n\nBy 1001, the rajahnate had established contact with the [[Song dynasty]] of [[China]]. The ''[[History of Song]]'' recorded the appearance of a Butuan mission at the [[Chinese imperial court]], and the rajahnate was described as a small [[Hinduism|Hindu]] country with a [[Theravada Buddhism|Buddhist]] monarchy, which had a regular trade connection with [[Champa]]. The mission, under a king named \"Kiling\", asked for equal status in court protocol with the Champa envoy, but ultimately was denied by the imperial court.<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline of history |url=http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm |accessdate=2009-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123061819/http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm |archivedate=2009-11-23 }}</ref><ref>[[William Henry Scott (historian)|Scott, William]] ''Prehispanic Source Materials: For the Study of Philippine History'', p. 66</ref> However, under the reign of Sri Bata Shaja, the diplomatic equality was eventually granted to the kingdom, and as a result the diplomatic relations of the two nations reached its peak in the [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref>''Song Shi'' Chapter 7 to 8</ref>\n\nEvidence of these trading links are in the discovery of 11 [[balangay]] boats around Ambangan in [[Barangay]] Libertad, which was described as the only concentration of archaeological, ancient, ocean-going boats in [[Southeast Asia]]. Other evidences of the post are the discovery of a village in Libertad that specializes in gold, deformed skulls similar to reports in [[Sulawesi]], and the discovery of many artifacts by locals and [[treasure hunting|treasure hunters]].\n\n===Colonial period===\nOn March 31, 1521, an [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]] ordered a [[Catholic mass|mass]] to be celebrated. This was officiated by Friar Pedro Valderrama, the [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] [[chaplain]] of the fleet, the only priest then. Another priest, the French Bernard Calmette (Bernardo Calmeta) had been [[marooning|marooned]] at [[Patagonia]] with Juan de Cartagena for being implicated in the mutiny at [[Puerto San Juli\u00e1n]]. Conducted near the shores of the island, the ''Holy First Mass'' marked the birth of [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines]]. [[Rajah]] Colambu and Siaiu were said to be among the first natives of the soon-to-be [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish colony]] to attend the mass among other Mazaua inhabitants, together with visitors from Butuan who came with the entourage of Colambu, king of Butuan.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nControversy has been generated regarding the holding of the first mass\u2014whether it was held in [[Limasawa]], [[Leyte]] in Masao, Butuan City, in the hidden isle made up of [[barangays]] Pinamanculan and Bancasi inside Butuan, in the latest discovered site in between [[Agusan del Sur]] and [[Surigao del Sur]], the small barangay of Barobo, or elsewhere. It is sure, however, that Ferdinand Magellan did not drop anchor by the mouth of [[Agusan River]] in 1521 and hold mass to commemorate the event which was held at Mazaua, an island separate from 1521 Butuan which, in the geographical conception of Europeans who wrote about it, was a larger entity than what it is now. [[Antonio Pigafetta]] who wrote an eyewitness account of [[Magellan's voyage]] described in text and in map a Butuan that stretched from today's [[Surigao City|Surigao]] up to the top edge of [[Zamboanga del Norte]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe first municipal election in Butuan took place in March 1902 in accordance with Public Law No. 82<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/act82-the-municipal-code.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710013233/http://lawph.com/statutes/act82-the-municipal-code.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-10 |title=A general act for the organization of municipal governments in the Philippine Islands |publisher=LawPH.com |accessdate=2011-04-09 }}</ref> which coincided with the American occupation of the place.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nDuring the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] in [[World War II]], more than half of Butuan, if not all of it, was burned when [[Philippine resistance against Japan#USAFFE and American sponsored guerrillas|local guerrilla forces]] attacked the enemy garrison on 12 March 1943 in the '''Battle of Butuan'''.<ref>Kent Holmes, ''Wendell Fertig and His Guerrilla Forces in the Philippines: Fighting the Japanese Occupation, 1942-1945'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Co., 2015), p. 112.</ref><ref name=Keats>Keats, J., 1963, They Fought Alone, New York:J.B.

On October 20, 1948, still recovering from the war, the entire municipality was ruined by a fire.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Modern era===\nBy the late 1940s to the 1970s, Butuan's industry specialized in [[timber]], earning it the nickname \"Timber City of the South\". The plentiful trees of the area invited many investors to the city, and inspired then-[[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Congressman]] Marcos M. Calo to file a bill elevating Butuan for cityhood. On August 2, 1950, this was passed, converting Butuan into a [[cities of the Philippines|city]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra523-butuan-city-charter.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712043612/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra523-butuan-city-charter.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=R.A.

The city's main income by that time frame and until this day depended on small and medium business, and large-scale projects by investors. On February 7, 1995, the city was reclassified from a chartered city to a Highly Urbanized city. Sixteen days later, on February 23, the region of [[Caraga]] was created by virtue of Republic Act 7901, with Butuan as its regional center, and the provincial capital of [[Agusan del Norte]]. In 2000, Republic Act 8811 formally transferred the capital of Agusan del Norte from Butuan to [[Cabadbaran]], however most provincial offices are still located in the city.\n\n==Geography==\n\nButuan City has a land area of {{convert|81662|ha}}, which is roughly 4.1% of the total area of the [[Caraga]] region.\n\nThe existing land use of the city consists of the following uses: agriculture areas (397.23&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), forestland (268&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), grass/shrub/pasture land (61.14&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and other uses (90.242&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Of the total forestland, 105&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is production forest areas while 167.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is protection forest areas.\n\nThe forestland, as mentioned earlier, comprised both the production and protection forest. The classified forest is further specified as production forest and protection forest. In the production forest industrial tree species are mostly grown in the area. The protection forest on the other hand, is preserved to support and sustain necessary ecological performance. Included in this are the watershed areas in Taguibo, which is the main source of water in the area,\n\nThe city is endowed with swamplands near its coastal area. These swamp areas are interconnected with the waterways joined by the Agusan River. Most of the swamplands are actually mangroves that served as habitat to different marine species.\n\nFilling material needs of the city are extracted usually from the riverbank of Taguibo River. Others are sourced out from promontories with special features and for special purpose.\n\nThe fishing ground of Butuan is the Butuan Bay of which two coastal barangays are located. It extends some two kilometers to the sea and joins the Bohol Sea. These are the barangays of Lumbocan and Masao.\n\n===Climate===\nButuan has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Af'').\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Butuan, Agusan del Norte (1981\u20132010, extremes 1980\u20132012)\n| metric first = Y\n| single line = Y\n| Jan record high C = 35.4\n| Feb record high C = 35.3\n| Mar record high C = 35.8\n| Apr record high C = 37.8\n| May record high C = 37.8\n| Jun record high C = 37.6\n| Jul record high C = 37.7\n| Aug record high C = 36.1\n| Sep record high C = 36.4\n| Oct record high C = 36.3\n| Nov record high C = 35.5\n| Dec record high C = 35.2\n|year record high C = 37.8\n| Jan high C = 30.2\n| Feb high C = 30.8\n| Mar high C = 31.8\n| Apr high C = 33.1\n| May high C = 33.7\n| Jun high C = 33.1\n| Jul high C = 32.6\n| Aug high C = 32.9\n| Sep high C = 32.9\n| Oct high C = 32.4\n| Nov high C = 31.7\n| Dec high C = 30.8\n| year high C = 32.2\n| Jan mean C = 26.3\n| Feb mean C = 26.6\n| Mar mean C = 27.3\n| Apr mean C = 28.3\n| May mean C = 28.9\n| Jun mean C = 28.5\n| Jul mean C = 28.2\n| Aug mean C = 28.4\n| Sep mean C = 28.3\n| Oct mean C = 28.0\n| Nov mean C = 27.5\n| Dec mean C = 26.9\n| year mean C = 27.8\n| Jan low C = 22.5\n| Feb low C = 22.5\n| Mar low C = 22.8\n| Apr low C = 23.5\n| May low C = 24.2\n| Jun low C = 24.0\n| Jul low C = 23.7\n| Aug low C = 23.9\n| Sep low C = 23.7\n| Oct low C = 23.6\n| Nov low C = 23.4\n| Dec low C = 22.9\n| year low C = 23.4\n| Jan record low C = 18.3\n| Feb record low C = 17.5\n| Mar record low C = 18.5\n| Apr record low C = 20.0\n| May record low C = 18.0\n| Jun record low C = 18.5\n| Jul record low C = 17.5\n| Aug record low C = 19.0\n| Sep record low C = 19.0\n| Oct record low C = 20.0\n| Nov record low C = 18.5\n| Dec record low C = 18.5\n|year record low C = 17.5\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 318.0\n| Feb rain mm = 225.0\n| Mar rain mm = 145.4\n| Apr rain mm = 109.7\n| May rain mm = 115.5\n| Jun rain mm = 154.0\n| Jul rain mm = 143.9\n| Aug rain mm = 105.6\n| Sep rain mm = 126.3\n| Oct rain mm = 178.4\n| Nov rain mm = 197.9\n| Dec rain mm = 238.2\n|year rain mm = 2057.8\n| unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan rain days = 21\n| Feb rain days = 16\n| Mar rain days = 16\n| Apr rain days = 13\n| May rain days = 14\n| Jun rain days = 17\n| Jul rain days = 16\n| Aug rain days = 13\n| Sep rain days = 14\n| Oct rain days = 16\n| Nov rain days = 18\n| Dec rain days = 20\n|year rain days = 194\n| Jan humidity = 88\n| Feb humidity = 85\n| Mar humidity = 84\n| Apr humidity = 82\n| May humidity = 82\n| Jun humidity = 83\n| Jul humidity = 84\n| Aug humidity = 82\n| Sep humidity = 82\n| Oct humidity = 84\n| Nov humidity = 86\n| Dec humidity = 88\n| year humidity = 84\n| source 1 = [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]]<ref name=PAGASAnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008043243/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasanormvalbutuanagdelnorte1981-2010.csv\n| archivedate = 8 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-normal-values/resource/df060d16-4cae-4180-b14a-e18b23f55ec7\n| title = Butuan, Agusan del Norte Climatological Normal Values\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 8 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=PAGASAextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008043321/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasaclimextrbutagusdelnorte.csv\n| archivedate = 8 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-extremes/resource/f5fb5f53-c75f-4880-83d9-23d2bced4c54\n| title = Butuan, Agusan del Norte Climatological Extremes\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 8 October 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Barangays===\nButuan is subdivided into 86 [[barangay]]s and group into 13 districts.<ref>Butuan City District and Barangays [http://butuan.gov.ph/page/district-and-barangayl \"Butuan City District and Barangays\"]</ref> Also, barangays 1 thru 26 form the [[Poblacion]] (city proper) of Butuan City.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;background-color:white;text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:top;\" \n!

It is customary for any traveler to learn a little bit of history concerning the place that will be visited, and the history of Butuan City is one of the most fascinating. Unlike other lands whose development only began during the Spanish colonization, Butuan was already a progressive and full fledge city centuries before the arrival of the Spaniards. Historical records show that as early as the 10th century, the local people were already engaged in trade and commerce with other nations and cultures, like the Champa (now Vietnam) and the Srivajaya peoples of Java, Indonesia. This is confirmed by the unearthing of several artifacts such as boats used for plying their trade. During the Spanish and American occupation, Butuan continued to make progress and the number of people who were settling increased steadily. A large number of its inhabitants were converted to Christianity, and in fact one of the issues is whether the first mass was actually held in the city.\n\n==Festivities and annual celebrations==\n{{Travel guide|1=section|date=June 2016}}\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | width1 = 237\n | image1 = Robinsons Place Butuan Main Facade, Kahimunan Festival 2018 (Original Work).jpg\n | alt1 = \n | width2 = 200\n | image2 = Kahimunan Festival Contingent.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | footer = Contingents from Mati NHS (Left) and a Festival Queen (Right) during Kahimunan Festival\n}}\n;Kahimunan Festival:The Kahimunan Festival<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.driftstories.com/kahimunan-festival-2019-experience/|title=A Gathering Under The Rain: Kahimunan Festival 2019|last=Kikoy|first=Herbert|date=2019-01-26|website=Drift Stories|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> is celebrated every third Sunday of January in celebration of the city patron [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Sr. Santo Ni\u00f1o]].

They were excavated in the Balangay Shrine, across the Masao River from Bood Promontory. They played a major role in Butuan because Butuan was, and still is, a port city. Since its discovery, the Balangays have become an icon of Butuan. The Kaya ng Pinoy, Inc. recreated the Balangay boats and have sailed it as part of their project, the Balangay Voyage.

The highest elevation nearest the seaside village of present-day Masao, Bood is a wooded area at a bend in the Masao River (El Rio de Butuan), overlooking Butuan Bay and ancient Butuan as well as the serpentine Masao River. Today, the indigenous Hadlayati tree abound, lording over a clonal nursery and tree park, amidst fishponds and archaeological treasures. According to the chronicles of Spanish historian Pigafetta, the event took place in the afternoon of March 31, 1521 after the Easter Mass was celebrated in the morning of the same date. Two Butuanon brother kings attended these Easter ceremonies. Pigafetta also noted the surrounding fields and balanghai boats on the bay that could be seen from the hill. The eco-park was established to provide the people of Butuan and its visitors a place to rekindle the past amidst a relaxing natural setting.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Main|Butuan City Hall Complex}}\n[[File:Butuan City Hall (September 25, 2018).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The city hall]]\n\nThe local government of [[Butuan City]] is headed by an elected Mayor and is considered to be the local chief executive of the city.
