He has a track record of public service and is known for implementing the ''[[Argentine Currency Board|Convertibilidad]]'' plan, which [[fixed exchange rate|fixed]] the [[United States dollar|dollar]]-[[Argentine peso|peso]] [[exchange rate]] at 1:1 between 1991 and 2001. This brought the Argentine inflation rate down from over 1,300% in 1990 to less than 20% in 1992 and nearly to zero during the rest of the 1990s.<ref name=prices>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indec.gov.ar/principal.asp?id_tema=729 |title=INDEC: consumer prices |access-date=2009-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619202042/http://www.indec.gov.ar/principal.asp?id_tema=729 |archive-date=2009-06-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Guided by his politics, Argentina entered into one of the most difficult crisis in its history. He is also well known for implementing the ''[[corralito]]'', which restrained Argentine citizens from withdrawing money from their bank accounts. This was followed by the [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|December 2001 riots]] and the fall of President [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]]. In 2015, he was sentenced for embezzlement, following an appeal. A definitive sentence still awaits.<ref>{{cite news|title=Menem, Cavallo sentenced to prison in fraud trial|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/204165/menem-cavallo-sentenced-to-prison-in-fraud-trial}}</ref><ref>http://www.infobae.com/2015/12/01/1773528-carlos-menem-y-domingo-cavallo-fueron-condenados-la-causa-sobresueldos</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nCavallo was born in [[San Francisco, C\u00f3rdoba|San Francisco]], [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba Province]] to Florencia and Felipe Cavallo, [[Italian Argentine]] immigrants from the [[Piedmont]] Region. He graduated with honors in [[Accounting]] (1967) and [[Economics]] (1968) at the [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]], where he earned his Doctorate in Economics in 1970. He married the former Sonia Abrazi\u00e1n in 1968, and had three children. He would later enroll at [[Harvard University]], where he earned a second [[doctorate]] in Economics in 1977.<ref>''Noticias''. 12 September 1991.</ref>\n\n==Beginnings in politics==\nHis involvement in politics began when he was elected as a student representative to the highest government body of the Economics School (1965\u20131966). He acted as undersecretary of Development of the provincial government (1969\u20131970), director (1971\u20131972) and vice president of the Board (1972\u20131973) of the provincial Bank and undersecretary of Interior of the national government.\n\nIn July 1982, after the [[Falklands War]] fiasco brought more moderate leadership to the [[Proceso de Reorganizaci\u00f3n Nacional|military dictatorship]], Cavallo was appointed president of the [[Banco Central de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina|Central Bank]]. He inherited the country's most acute financial and economic crisis since 1930, and a particularly heinous Central Bank regulation painfully remembered as the Central Bank Circular 1050. Implemented in 1980 at the behest of conservative Economy Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz]], the policy tied adjustable loan installments (nearly all lending in Argentina is on an adjustable interest basis) to the value of the [[United States Dollar|US Dollar]] locally. [[Exchange rates]] were controlled at the time and therefore raised little concern. The next February, however, the peso was sharply devalued and continued to plummet for the rest of 1981 and into 1982. Mortgage and business borrowers saw their monthly installments increase over tenfold in just a year and many, including homeowners just months away from paying off their loans, unable to keep up, either lost their entire equity (see, ''[[negative amortization]]'') or everything outright.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2002/04/14/e-01003.htm|title=El recuerdo de la Circular 1050|work=Clar\u00edn|date=April 14, 2002}}</ref>\n\nCavallo immediately rescinded the hated ''Circular 1050'' and as a result, saved millions of homeowners and small-business owners from financial ruin (as well as millions more, indirectly). What followed, however, remained the subject of great controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1406673-ordenan-investigar-si-cavallo-debe-devolver-17000-millones-de-dolares|title=Ordenan investigar si Cavallo debe devolver 17.000 millones de d\u00f3lares|work=La Naci\u00f3n|date=September 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThough nothing new to the [[economic history of Argentina]], he is often accused of implementing financial policies that may have allowed Argentina's main private enterprises to transfer their debts to the state, transforming their private debt into public obligations. During 1982 and 1983, more than 200 firms (30 economic groups and 106 transnational enterprises) transferred a great part of their 17 billion dollar debt to the federal government, thanks to secured exchange rates on loan installments. This fraud took place both before and after his very brief turn at the Central Bank, but not while he was in charge. In a speech in September 1982 he was forced renounce and express his opposition to the transfer of debt to the state.<ref>{{cite book |title=Econom\u00eda en Tiempos de Crisis |author=Cavallo, Domingo |page=25}}</ref> He inherited this practice from Mart\u00ednez de Hoz himself (whose chief interest, steelmaker [[Acindar]], had unloaded US$700 million of its debts in this way). Moreover, Cavallo subjected payments covered by these exchange rate guarantees to [[indexation]]; this latter stipulation was dropped by his successor, Julio Gonz\u00e1lez del Solar.<ref>''Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth''. World Bank, 1993.</ref> In either case, the mechanism turning private debt into liabilities of the state continued even after the [[1983 Argentine general election|advent of democracy]] under [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]] (1983\u201389) and into the [[Argentine economic crisis|economic crisis]] that surrounded the [[Historical exchange rates of Argentine currency|peso]]'s last sharp devaluation in early 2002.\n\nThis controversy notwithstanding, upon Argentina's return to democracy in December 1983, he became a close economic advisor to [[Peronism|Peronist]] politician [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Sota]] and was elected as a Peronist [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|deputy]] for C\u00f3rdoba Province in the [[1987 Argentine legislative election|1987 mid-term polls]]. Drawing from his ''Fundaci\u00f3n Mediterr\u00e1nea'' think-tank, he prepared an academic team for taking over the management of the economy, and to that end he participated actively in [[Carlos Menem]]'s bid for the presidency [[1989 Argentine general election|in 1989]]. President Alfons\u00edn's efforts to control [[hyperinflation]] (which reached 200% a month in July 1989) failed, and led to [[1989 riots in Argentina|food riots]] and Alfons\u00edn's resignation.\n\nAs Foreign Minister, in 1989 he met with British Foreign Secretary [[John Major]], this being the first such meeting since the end of the Falklands War seven years earlier.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Major|title=John Major: The Autobiography|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1999|page=123}}</ref>\n\n==The Menem administration==\n[[File:Cavallo.ogv|thumb|250px|Cavallo introduces the Convertibility Plan in 1991.]]\nAs Menem initially chose to deliver the Economy Ministry to senior executives of the firm [[Bunge y Born]], Cavallo had to wait a few more years to put his economic theories into practice. He served as Menem's foreign minister, and was instrumental in the realignment of Argentina with the [[Washington Consensus]] advanced by [[U.S. President]] [[George H.W. Bush]]. Finally, after several false starts, and two further peaks of hyperinflation, Menem put Cavallo at the helm of the Argentine Economy Ministry in February, 1991.\n\nCavallo was the ideologist behind the Convertibility Plan, which created a [[Argentine Currency Board|currency board]] that fixed the dollar-peso [[Historical exchange rates of Argentine currency|exchange rate]] at 1 peso per US dollar; he signed his plan into law on April 1, 1991. Cavallo thus succeeded in defeating inflation, which had averaged over 220% a year from 1975 to 1988, had leapt to 5000% in 1989, and remained at 1300% as late as 1990.<ref name=prices/>\n\nPresident Menem had already privatized the state telecom concern and national airlines (the once-premier airline in Latin America, ''[[Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas]]'', which was later almost run into the ground). The stability Cavallo's plan helped bring about, however, opened prospects for more [[privatization]]s than ever. Going on to total over 200 [[state enterprise]]s, these included: the costly state railroads concern, the state oil monopoly [[Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales|YPF]], several public utilities, two government television stations, 10,000&nbsp;km (6000&nbsp;mi) of roads, steel and petrochemical firms, grain elevators, hotels, subways and even racetracks. A panoply of provincial and municipal banks were sold to financial giants abroad (sometimes over the opposition of their respective governors and mayors) and, taking a page from the [[Chile pension system]] privatization, the mandatory [[ANSES|National Pension System]] was opened to choice through the authorization of [[private pension]] schemes.\n\nGDP, long stuck at its 1973 level even with a growing population, grew by about a third from early 1991 to late 1994. [[Fixed investment]], depressed since the 1981\u201382 crisis, more than doubled during this period. Consumers also benefited: income poverty fell by about half (to under 20%) and new auto sales (likewise depressed since 1982) jumped fivefold, to about 500,000 units. This boom, however, had its problems early on. Tight federal budgets kept the budget deficits of the provinces from improving and, though many benefited from Cavallo's insistence that large employers translate higher productivity into higher pay, this same productivity boom (as well as the nearly 200,000 layoffs the privatizations caused) helped unemployment jump from about 7% in 1991\u201392 to over 12%, by 1994. The [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico|1995 Mexican Crisis]] shocked consumer and business confidence and ratcheted joblessness to 18% (the highest since the 1930s).\n\nConfidence and the economy recovered relatively quickly; but, the consequences of double-digit unemployment soon created a [[crime|crime wave]] that to some extent continues to this day. Unemployment and poverty eased only very slowly after the return to growth in early 1996.\n\n==Independent==\nIn 1996, shortly after Menem's reelection, the flux of money from privatisation ceased, and Cavallo was ousted from the cabinet, due to his volatile personality and fights with other cabinet members, coupled with staggering unemployment and social unrest caused by his economic policies and the [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico|Mexican crisis]]. In mid-1995, Cavallo denounced the existence of presumed \"[[mafia]]s\" entrenched within the circles of power. After his first public accusations, relations between Cavallo, President Menem and his colleagues became progressively strained. Following months of speculation, Menem asked for his resignation on July 26, 1996.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/96/07/27/central.htm ''Clar\u00edn''. 27 July 1996] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nCavallo founded a political party, ''Acci\u00f3n por la Rep\u00fablica'' ([[Action for the Republic]]), which allowed him to return to Congress, this time as a Deputy for the City of [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nCavallo ran for president in [[1999 Argentine general election|1999]], but was defeated by [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]]. Cavallo came in third place and received 11% of the vote, far behind both de la R\u00faa and the other main candidate, [[Peronist]] [[Eduardo Duhalde]]. He also ran for Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2000, and lost to [[An\u00edbal Ibarra]].\n\n==De la R\u00faa and the crisis==\nCavallo was called by President de la R\u00faa in March 2001 to lead the economy once again, in the face of a weakened coalition government and two years of recession.<ref>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=56668 ''La Naci\u00f3n''. 20 March 2001] {{in lang|es}}</ref> He attempted to restore business confidence by renegotiating the external debt with the [[International Monetary Fund]] and with bondholders, but the growing [[country risk]] and spiraling [[put option]]s by large investors and foreign holdings led to a bank run and a massive [[capital flight]]. In late November 2001, Cavallo introduced a set of measures that blocked the usage of cash, informally known as the ''[[corralito]]'' (\"financial corral\"). The anger of those Argentines with the means to invest abroad created a framework for the popular middle-class [[protest]] termed the ''[[cacerolazo]]''. Political pressure by the Peronist opposition and other organized economic interests coincided with the [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|December 2001 riots]]. This critical situation finally forced Cavallo, and then de la R\u00faa, to resign.<ref>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=360753 ''La Naci\u00f3n''. 20 December 2001] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nA series of Peronist presidents came and left in the next few days, until [[Eduardo Duhalde]], the opponent of De la Rua and Cavallo in the 1999 presidential election, took power on January 2, 2002. Soon afterwards the government decreed the end of peso-dollar convertibility, [[devaluation|devalued]] the peso and soon afterwards let it [[floating exchange rate|float]], which led to a swift [[depreciation (currency)|depreciation]] (the exchange rate briefly reached 4 pesos per dollar in July 2002) and inflation (about 40% in 2002).\n\nCavallo's policies are viewed by opponents as major causes of the [[deindustrialization]] and the rise of unemployment, poverty and crime endured by Argentina in the late 1990s, as well as the [[Argentine economic crisis|collapse of 2001]], the ensuing [[default (finance)|default]] of the Argentine public debt.\n\n==After the crisis==\nBetween April and June 2002, Cavallo was jailed for alleged participation in illegal weapons sales during the Menem administration.

He is also well known for implementing the ''[[corralito]]'', which restrained Argentine citizens from withdrawing money from their bank accounts. This was followed by the [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|December 2001 riots]] and the fall of President [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]]. In 2015, he was sentenced for embezzlement, following an appeal. A definitive sentence still awaits.<ref>{{cite news|title=Menem, Cavallo sentenced to prison in fraud trial|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/204165/menem-cavallo-sentenced-to-prison-in-fraud-trial}}</ref><ref>http://www.infobae.com/2015/12/01/1773528-carlos-menem-y-domingo-cavallo-fueron-condenados-la-causa-sobresueldos</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nCavallo was born in [[San Francisco, C\u00f3rdoba|San Francisco]], [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba Province]] to Florencia and Felipe Cavallo, [[Italian Argentine]] immigrants from the [[Piedmont]] Region. He graduated with honors in [[Accounting]] (1967) and [[Economics]] (1968) at the [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]], where he earned his Doctorate in Economics in 1970. He married the former Sonia Abrazi\u00e1n in 1968, and had three children. He would later enroll at [[Harvard University]], where he earned a second [[doctorate]] in Economics in 1977.<ref>''Noticias''. 12 September 1991.</ref>\n\n==Beginnings in politics==\nHis involvement in politics began when he was elected as a student representative to the highest government body of the Economics School (1965\u20131966). He acted as undersecretary of Development of the provincial government (1969\u20131970), director (1971\u20131972) and vice president of the Board (1972\u20131973) of the provincial Bank and undersecretary of Interior of the national government.\n\nIn July 1982, after the [[Falklands War]] fiasco brought more moderate leadership to the [[Proceso de Reorganizaci\u00f3n Nacional|military dictatorship]], Cavallo was appointed president of the [[Banco Central de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina|Central Bank]]. He inherited the country's most acute financial and economic crisis since 1930, and a particularly heinous Central Bank regulation painfully remembered as the Central Bank Circular 1050. Implemented in 1980 at the behest of conservative Economy Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz]], the policy tied adjustable loan installments (nearly all lending in Argentina is on an adjustable interest basis) to the value of the [[United States Dollar|US Dollar]] locally. [[Exchange rates]] were controlled at the time and therefore raised little concern. The next February, however, the peso was sharply devalued and continued to plummet for the rest of 1981 and into 1982. Mortgage and business borrowers saw their monthly installments increase over tenfold in just a year and many, including homeowners just months away from paying off their loans, unable to keep up, either lost their entire equity (see, ''[[negative amortization]]'') or everything outright.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2002/04/14/e-01003.htm|title=El recuerdo de la Circular 1050|work=Clar\u00edn|date=April 14, 2002}}</ref>\n\nCavallo immediately rescinded the hated ''Circular 1050'' and as a result, saved millions of homeowners and small-business owners from financial ruin (as well as millions more, indirectly). What followed, however, remained the subject of great controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1406673-ordenan-investigar-si-cavallo-debe-devolver-17000-millones-de-dolares|title=Ordenan investigar si Cavallo debe devolver 17.000 millones de d\u00f3lares|work=La Naci\u00f3n|date=September 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThough nothing new to the [[economic history of Argentina]], he is often accused of implementing financial policies that may have allowed Argentina's main private enterprises to transfer their debts to the state, transforming their private debt into public obligations. During 1982 and 1983, more than 200 firms (30 economic groups and 106 transnational enterprises) transferred a great part of their 17 billion dollar debt to the federal government, thanks to secured exchange rates on loan installments. This fraud took place both before and after his very brief turn at the Central Bank, but not while he was in charge. In a speech in September 1982 he was forced renounce and express his opposition to the transfer of debt to the state.<ref>{{cite book |title=Econom\u00eda en Tiempos de Crisis |author=Cavallo, Domingo |page=25}}</ref> He inherited this practice from Mart\u00ednez de Hoz himself (whose chief interest, steelmaker [[Acindar]], had unloaded US$700 million of its debts in this way). Moreover, Cavallo subjected payments covered by these exchange rate guarantees to [[indexation]]; this latter stipulation was dropped by his successor, Julio Gonz\u00e1lez del Solar.<ref>''Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth''. World Bank, 1993.</ref> In either case, the mechanism turning private debt into liabilities of the state continued even after the [[1983 Argentine general election|advent of democracy]] under [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]] (1983\u201389) and into the [[Argentine economic crisis|economic crisis]] that surrounded the [[Historical exchange rates of Argentine currency|peso]]'s last sharp devaluation in early 2002.\n\nThis controversy notwithstanding, upon Argentina's return to democracy in December 1983, he became a close economic advisor to [[Peronism|Peronist]] politician [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Sota]] and was elected as a Peronist [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|deputy]] for C\u00f3rdoba Province in the [[1987 Argentine legislative election|1987 mid-term polls]]. Drawing from his ''Fundaci\u00f3n Mediterr\u00e1nea'' think-tank, he prepared an academic team for taking over the management of the economy, and to that end he participated actively in [[Carlos Menem]]'s bid for the presidency [[1989 Argentine general election|in 1989]]. President Alfons\u00edn's efforts to control [[hyperinflation]] (which reached 200% a month in July 1989) failed, and led to [[1989 riots in Argentina|food riots]] and Alfons\u00edn's resignation.\n\nAs Foreign Minister, In 1989 he met with British Foreign Secretary [[John Major]], this being the first such meeting since the end of the Falklands War seven years earlier.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Major|title=John Major: The Autobiography|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1999|page=123}}</ref>\n\n==The Menem administration==\n[[File:Cavallo.ogv|thumb|250px|Cavallo introduces the Convertibility Plan in 1991.]]\nAs Menem initially chose to deliver the Economy Ministry to senior executives of the firm [[Bunge y Born]], Cavallo had to wait a few more years to put his economic theories into practice. He served as Menem's foreign minister, and was instrumental in the realignment of Argentina with the [[Washington Consensus]] advanced by [[U.S. President]] [[George H.W. Bush]]. Finally, after several false starts, and two further peaks of hyperinflation, Menem put Cavallo at the helm of the Argentine Economy Ministry in February, 1991.\n\nCavallo was the ideologist behind the Convertibility Plan, which created a [[Argentine Currency Board|currency board]] that fixed the dollar-peso [[Historical exchange rates of Argentine currency|exchange rate]] at 1 peso per US dollar; he signed his plan into law on April 1, 1991. Cavallo thus succeeded in defeating inflation, which had averaged over 220% a year from 1975 to 1988, had leapt to 5000% in 1989, and remained at 1300% as late as 1990.<ref name=prices/>\n\nPresident Menem had already privatized the state telecom concern and national airlines (the once-premier airline in Latin America, ''[[Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas]]'', which was later almost run into the ground). The stability Cavallo's plan helped bring about, however, opened prospects for more [[privatization]]s than ever. Going on to total over 200 [[state enterprise]]s, these included: the costly state railroads concern, the state oil monopoly [[Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales|YPF]], several public utilities, two government television stations, 10,000&nbsp;km (6000&nbsp;mi) of roads, steel and petrochemical firms, grain elevators, hotels, subways and even racetracks. A panoply of provincial and municipal banks were sold to financial giants abroad (sometimes over the opposition of their respective governors and mayors) and, taking a page from the [[Chile pension system]] privatization, the mandatory [[ANSES|National Pension System]] was opened to choice through the authorization of [[private pension]] schemes.\n\nGDP, long stuck at its 1973 level even with a growing population, grew by about a third from early 1991 to late 1994. [[Fixed investment]], depressed since the 1981\u201382 crisis, more than doubled during this period. Consumers also benefited: income poverty fell by about half (to under 20%) and new auto sales (likewise depressed since 1982) jumped fivefold, to about 500,000 units. This boom, however, had its problems early on. Tight federal budgets kept the budget deficits of the provinces from improving and, though many benefited from Cavallo's insistence that large employers translate higher productivity into higher pay, this same productivity boom (as well as the nearly 200,000 layoffs the privatizations caused) helped unemployment jump from about 7% in 1991\u201392 to over 12%, by 1994. The [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico|1995 Mexican Crisis]] shocked consumer and business confidence and ratcheted joblessness to 18% (the highest since the 1930s).\n\nConfidence and the economy recovered relatively quickly; but, the consequences of double-digit unemployment soon created a [[crime|crime wave]] that to some extent continues to this day. Unemployment and poverty eased only very slowly after the return to growth in early 1996.\n\n==Independent==\nIn 1996, shortly after Menem's reelection, the flux of money from privatisation ceased, and Cavallo was ousted from the cabinet, due to his volatile personality and fights with other cabinet members, coupled with staggering unemployment and social unrest caused by his economic policies and the [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico|Mexican crisis]]. In mid-1995, Cavallo denounced the existence of presumed \"[[mafia]]s\" entrenched within the circles of power. After his first public accusations, relations between Cavallo, President Menem and his colleagues became progressively strained. Following months of speculation, Menem asked for his resignation on July 26, 1996.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/96/07/27/central.htm ''Clar\u00edn''. 27 July 1996] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nCavallo founded a political party, ''Acci\u00f3n por la Rep\u00fablica'' ([[Action for the Republic]]), which allowed him to return to Congress, this time as a Deputy for the City of [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nCavallo ran for president in [[1999 Argentine general election|1999]], but was defeated by [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]]. Cavallo came in third place and received 11% of the vote, far behind both de la R\u00faa and the other main candidate, [[Peronist]] [[Eduardo Duhalde]]. He also ran for Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2000, and lost to [[An\u00edbal Ibarra]].\n\n==De la R\u00faa and the crisis==\nCavallo was called by President de la R\u00faa in March 2001 to lead the economy once again, in the face of a weakened coalition government and two years of recession.<ref>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=56668 ''La Naci\u00f3n''. 20 March 2001] {{in lang|es}}</ref> He attempted to restore business confidence by renegotiating the external debt with the [[International Monetary Fund]] and with bondholders, but the growing [[country risk]] and spiraling [[put option]]s by large investors and foreign holdings led to a bank run and a massive [[capital flight]]. In late November 2001, Cavallo introduced a set of measures that blocked the usage of cash, informally known as the ''[[corralito]]'' (\"financial corral\"). The anger of those Argentines with the means to invest abroad created a framework for the popular middle-class [[protest]] termed the ''[[cacerolazo]]''. Political pressure by the Peronist opposition and other organized economic interests coincided with the [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|December 2001 riots]]. This critical situation finally forced Cavallo, and then de la R\u00faa, to resign.<ref>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=360753 ''La Naci\u00f3n''. 20 December 2001] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nA series of Peronist presidents came and left in the next few days, until [[Eduardo Duhalde]], the opponent of De la Rua and Cavallo in the 1999 presidential election, took power on January 2, 2002. Soon afterwards the government decreed the end of peso-dollar convertibility, [[devaluation|devalued]] the peso and soon afterwards let it [[floating exchange rate|float]], which led to a swift [[depreciation (currency)|depreciation]] (the exchange rate briefly reached 4 pesos per dollar in July 2002) and inflation (about 40% in 2002).\n\nCavallo's policies are viewed by opponents as major causes of the [[deindustrialization]] and the rise of unemployment, poverty and crime endured by Argentina in the late 1990s, as well as the [[Argentine economic crisis|collapse of 2001]], the ensuing [[default (finance)|default]] of the Argentine public debt.\n\n==After the crisis==\nBetween April and June 2002, Cavallo was jailed for alleged participation in illegal weapons sales during the Menem administration.

After World War II, fundamental research became an increasingly important task of Leiden University\u2019s Faculty of Medicine. The Biomedical Science study programme is an expression of this. In patient care, high technology treatments have come in the place of admissions lasting weeks or months.\n\nThe many years of collaboration between the university and the teaching hospital acquired greater permanence in 1996 when the hospital and medical faculty merged to form Leiden University Medical Center, with patient care, instruction, study programmes, continuing education and research as its five core tasks.\n\nThe opening of two new buildings on 1 December 2006 was the fulfilment of a wish of long standing: all the core tasks are now under one roof.

The German neoliberals accepted the classical liberal notion that competition drives economic prosperity, but they argued that a laissez-faire state policy stifles competition, as the strong devour the weak since monopolies and cartels could pose a threat to freedom of competition. They supported the creation of a well-developed legal system and capable regulatory apparatus. While still opposed to full-scale Keynesian employment policies or an extensive [[welfare state]], German neoliberal theory was marked by the willingness to place [[Humanistic capitalism|humanistic]] and social values on par with economic efficiency. [[Alfred M\u00fcller-Armack]] coined the phrase \"social market economy\" to emphasize the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and humanistic bent of the idea.<ref name=Boas2009/> According to Boas and Gans-Morse, [[Walter Eucken]] stated that \"social security and social justice are the greatest concerns of our time\".<ref name=Boas2009/>\n\n[[File:Marshallplanhilfe.gif|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Builders in [[West Berlin]], 1952]]\n\nErhard emphasized that the market was inherently social and did not need to be made so.<ref name=\"Hartwich\"/> He hoped that growing prosperity would enable the population to manage much of their social security by self-reliance and end the necessity for a widespread welfare state. By the name of ''Volkskapitalismus'', there were some efforts to foster private savings. However, although average contributions to the public old age insurance were quite small, it remained by far the most important old age income source for a majority of the German population, therefore despite liberal rhetoric the 1950s witnessed what has been called a \"reluctant expansion of the welfare state\". To end widespread poverty among the elderly the pension reform of 1957 brought a significant extension of the German welfare state which already had been established under [[Otto von Bismarck]].<ref>Werner Abelshauser, ''Deutsche Wirtschaftsgeschichte seit 1945'', C.H.

They were particularly impressed by the [[social market economy]] and the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (\"economic miracle\") in Germany and speculated about the possibility of accomplishing similar policies in their own countries. Note that neoliberalism in 1960s Argentina meant a philosophy that was more moderate than entirely [[Laissez-faire]] [[free market]] [[capitalism]] and favored using state policy to temper [[social inequality]] and counter a tendency towards monopoly.<ref name=\"Boas2009\" />\n\nIn 1976, the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]]'s economic plan led by [[Mart\u00ednez de Hoz]] was the first attempt at establishing a neoliberal program in Argentina. They implemented a fiscal [[austerity]] plan that reduced money printing in an attempt to counter inflation. In order to achieve this, salaries were frozen. However, they were unable to reduce inflation, which led to a drop in the real salary of the working class. They also liberalized trade policy so that foreign goods could freely enter the country. Argentina's industry, which had been on the rise for 20 years after the economic policies of former president [[Arturo Frondizi]], rapidly declined as it was not able to compete with foreign goods. The deregulation of the financial sector, however, lead to short-term economic growth, before rapid decline after capital fled to the United States.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Following the measures, there was an increase in poverty from 9% in 1975 to 40% at the end of 1982.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom 1989 to 2001, more neoliberal policies were implemented by [[Domingo Cavallo]]. This time, the privatization of public services was the main focus, although financial deregulation and free trade with foreign nations were also re-implemented. Along with an increased [[labour market flexibility]], the unemployment rate dropped to 18.3%.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2005|title=Poster Child or Victim of Imperialist Globalization?

For example, tariff rates were cut from 32 percent in 1990 to 14 percent in 1994. During this period, Brazil effectively ended its policy of maintaining a closed economy focused on [[import substitution industrialization]] in favor of a more open economic system with a much higher degree of privatization. The market reforms and trade reforms ultimately resulted in price stability and a faster inflow of capital, but had little effect on income inequality and poverty.

''Vienna and Chicago: Friends or Foes? A Tale of Two Schools of Free-Market Economics'', (Capital Press, 2005) {{ISBN|0895260298}}</ref>\n\nThe school emphasizes non-intervention from government and generally rejects regulation in markets as inefficient, with the exception of central bank regulation of the money supply (i.e. [[monetarism]]). Although the school's association with neoliberalism is sometimes resisted by its proponents,<ref name=\"ElgarComp\" /> its emphasis on reduced government intervention in the economy and a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' ideology have brought about an affiliation between the Chicago school and neoliberal economics.<ref name=\"FPIF-2004\"/><ref name=Biglaiser>{{cite journal|last=Biglaiser|first=Glen|title=The Internationalization of Chicago's Economics in Latin America|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|date=January 2002|volume=50|issue=2|doi=10.1086/322875|pages=269\u201386|jstor=322875}}</ref>\n\n==Political policy aspects==\nNeoliberal policies center around [[economic liberalization]], principally [[deregulation]] of industry, [[privatization]] of state-owned enterprises, reductions to [[trade barriers]], reductions in [[government spending]], and [[monetarism]].<ref name=Masters/> Neoliberal theory contends that free markets encourage [[economic efficiency]], [[economic growth]], and [[technological innovation]]. [[State intervention]], even if aimed at encouraging these phenomena, is generally believed to worsen economic performance.<ref name=\"kotz\" />{{rp|12}}\n\n===Economic and political freedom===\n[[File:Milton friedman y richard nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]] and [[Richard Nixon]]]]\nNeoliberalism advances the view that economic and political freedom are inextricably linked. [[Milton Friedman]] argued in his book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' that [[economic freedom]], while itself an extremely important component of [[freedom|absolute freedom]], is also a necessary condition for [[political freedom]]. He claimed that [[centrally planned economy|centralized control of economic activities]] is always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, the voluntary character of all transactions in an unregulated market economy and wide diversity that it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders that greatly diminish the power to coerce. Through the elimination of centralized control of economic activities, [[economic power]] is separated from political power and each can serve as a counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.<ref name=\":1\">Milton Friedman. ''Capitalism and freedom''. (2002). The University of Chicago. {{ISBN|0-226-26421-1}} pp. 8\u201321</ref> In ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', [[Friedrich Hayek]] offered a similar argument: \"Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends\".<ref name=\"Chicago Press 1944 p.95\"/> Amplifying their arguments, it has often been pointed out that increasing economic freedoms tends to raise expectations on political freedoms, eventually leading to democracy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Monetarism===\n{{Main |Monetarism}}\nMonetarism is an economic theory commonly associated with neoliberalism.<ref name=\"harvey1\"/> Formulated by [[Milton Friedman]], it focuses on the macroeconomic aspects of the [[supply of money]], paying particular attention to the effects of [[central bank]]ing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McCallum |first1=Bennett T. |title=Monetarism |url=https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Monetarism.html |website=The Library of Economics and Liberty |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> It argues that excessive expansion of the money supply is inherently inflationary and that monetary authorities should focus primarily on maintaining [[price stability]], even at the cost of other macroeconomic factors like [[economic growth]].\n\nMonetarism is often associated with the policies of the [[Federal Reserve System|US Federal Reserve]] under the [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Chairmanship]] of economist [[Paul Volcker]],<ref name=\"harvey1\"/> which centered around high interest rates that are widely credited with ending the high levels of inflation seen in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hutchinson

interest rates to counter inflation that had spiraled to over 600%.<ref name=\":4\"/> This helped to successfully reduce inflation to below 10%,<ref name=\":4\"/> but also resulted in job losses.\n\n===The Washington Consensus===\n{{Main |Washington Consensus}}\n{{See also |Structural adjustment}}\nThe Washington Consensus is a set of standardized policy prescriptions developed by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[World Bank]], and the [[US Department of Treasury]] for crisis-wracked developing countries, and is often associated with neoliberalism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hurt |first1=Stephen R. |title=Washington Consensus |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Washington-consensus |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> These prescriptions, often attached as conditions for loans from the IMF and World Bank, focus on market [[liberalization]], and in particular on lowering [[barriers to trade]], controlling [[inflation]], privatizing [[state-owned enterprise]]s, and reducing government budget deficits.\n\n==Criticism==\nNeoliberalism has its share of criticism in both [[left-wing politics|left]] and [[right-wing

The German neoliberals accepted the classical liberal notion that competition drives economic prosperity, but they argued that a laissez-faire state policy stifles competition, as the strong devour the weak since monopolies and cartels could pose a threat to freedom of competition. They supported the creation of a well-developed legal system and capable regulatory apparatus. While still opposed to full-scale Keynesian employment policies or an extensive [[welfare state]], German neoliberal theory was marked by the willingness to place [[Humanistic capitalism|humanistic]] and social values on par with economic efficiency. [[Alfred M\u00fcller-Armack]] coined the phrase \"social market economy\" to emphasize the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and humanistic bent of the idea.<ref name=Boas2009/> According to Boas and Gans-Morse, [[Walter Eucken]] stated that \"social security and social justice are the greatest concerns of our time\".<ref name=Boas2009/>\n\n[[File:Marshallplanhilfe.gif|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Builders in [[West Berlin]], 1952]]\n\nErhard emphasized that the market was inherently social and did not need to be made so.<ref name=\"Hartwich\"/> He hoped that growing prosperity would enable the population to manage much of their social security by self-reliance and end the necessity for a widespread welfare state. By the name of ''Volkskapitalismus'', there were some efforts to foster private savings. However, although average contributions to the public old age insurance were quite small, it remained by far the most important old age income source for a majority of the German population, therefore despite liberal rhetoric the 1950s witnessed what has been called a \"reluctant expansion of the welfare state\". To end widespread poverty among the elderly the pension reform of 1957 brought a significant extension of the German welfare state which already had been established under [[Otto von Bismarck]].<ref>Werner Abelshauser, ''Deutsche Wirtschaftsgeschichte seit 1945'', C.H.

They were particularly impressed by the [[social market economy]] and the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (\"economic miracle\") in Germany and speculated about the possibility of accomplishing similar policies in their own countries. Note that neoliberalism in 1960s Argentina meant a philosophy that was more moderate than entirely [[Laissez-faire]] [[free market]] [[capitalism]] and favored using state policy to temper [[social inequality]] and counter a tendency towards monopoly.<ref name=\"Boas2009\" />\n\nIn 1976, the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]]'s economic plan led by [[Mart\u00ednez de Hoz]] was the first attempt at establishing a neoliberal program in Argentina. They implemented a fiscal [[austerity]] plan that reduced money printing in an attempt to counter inflation. In order to achieve this, salaries were frozen. However, they were unable to reduce inflation, which led to a drop in the real salary of the working class. They also liberalized trade policy so that foreign goods could freely enter the country. Argentina's industry, which had been on the rise for 20 years after the economic policies of former president [[Arturo Frondizi]], rapidly declined as it was not able to compete with foreign goods. The deregulation of the financial sector, however, lead to short-term economic growth, before rapid decline after capital fled to the United States.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Following the measures, there was an increase in poverty from 9% in 1975 to 40% at the end of 1982.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom 1989 to 2001, more neoliberal policies were implemented by [[Domingo Cavallo]]. This time, the privatization of public services was the main focus, although financial deregulation and free trade with foreign nations were also re-implemented. Along with an increased [[labour market flexibility]], the unemployment rate dropped to 18.3%.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2005|title=Poster Child or Victim of Imperialist Globalization?

For example, tariff rates were cut from 32 percent in 1990 to 14 percent in 1994. During this period, Brazil effectively ended its policy of maintaining a closed economy focused on [[import substitution industrialization]] in favor of a more open economic system with a much higher degree of privatization. The market reforms and trade reforms ultimately resulted in price stability and a faster inflow of capital, but had little effect on income inequality and poverty.

''Vienna and Chicago: Friends or Foes? A Tale of Two Schools of Free-Market Economics'', (Capital Press, 2005) {{ISBN|0895260298}}</ref>\n\nThe school emphasizes non-intervention from government and generally rejects regulation in markets as inefficient, with the exception of central bank regulation of the money supply (i.e. [[monetarism]]). Although the school's association with neoliberalism is sometimes resisted by its proponents,<ref name=\"ElgarComp\" /> its emphasis on reduced government intervention in the economy and a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' ideology have brought about an affiliation between the Chicago school and neoliberal economics.<ref name=\"FPIF-2004\"/><ref name=Biglaiser>{{cite journal|last=Biglaiser|first=Glen|title=The Internationalization of Chicago's Economics in Latin America|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|date=January 2002|volume=50|issue=2|doi=10.1086/322875|pages=269\u201386|jstor=322875}}</ref>\n\n==Political policy aspects==\nNeoliberal policies center around [[economic liberalization]], principally [[deregulation]] of industry, [[privatization]] of state-owned enterprises, reductions to [[trade barriers]], reductions in [[government spending]], and [[monetarism]].<ref name=Masters/> Neoliberal theory contends that free markets encourage [[economic efficiency]], [[economic growth]], and [[technological innovation]]. [[State intervention]], even if aimed at encouraging these phenomena, is generally believed to worsen economic performance.<ref name=\"kotz\" />{{rp|12}}\n\n===Economic and political freedom===\n[[File:Milton friedman y richard nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]] and [[Richard Nixon]]]]\nNeoliberalism advances the view that economic and political freedom are inextricably linked. [[Milton Friedman]] argued in his book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' that [[economic freedom]], while itself an extremely important component of [[freedom|absolute freedom]], is also a necessary condition for [[political freedom]]. He claimed that [[centrally planned economy|centralized control of economic activities]] is always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, the voluntary character of all transactions in an unregulated market economy and wide diversity that it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders that greatly diminish the power to coerce. Through the elimination of centralized control of economic activities, [[economic power]] is separated from political power and each can serve as a counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.<ref name=\":1\">Milton Friedman. ''Capitalism and freedom''. (2002). The University of Chicago. {{ISBN|0-226-26421-1}} pp. 8\u201321</ref> In ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', [[Friedrich Hayek]] offered a similar argument: \"Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends\".<ref name=\"Chicago Press 1944 p.95\"/> Amplifying their arguments, it has often been pointed out that increasing economic freedoms tends to raise expectations on political freedoms, eventually leading to democracy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Monetarism===\n{{Main |Monetarism}}\nMonetarism is an economic theory commonly associated with neoliberalism.<ref name=\"harvey1\"/> Formulated by [[Milton Friedman]], it focuses on the macroeconomic aspects of the [[supply of money]], paying particular attention to the effects of [[central bank]]ing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McCallum |first1=Bennett T. |title=Monetarism |url=https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Monetarism.html |website=The Library of Economics and Liberty |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> It argues that excessive expansion of the money supply is inherently inflationary and that monetary authorities should focus primarily on maintaining [[price stability]], even at the cost of other macroeconomic factors like [[economic growth]].\n\nMonetarism is often associated with the policies of the [[Federal Reserve System|US Federal Reserve]] under the [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Chairmanship]] of economist [[Paul Volcker]],<ref name=\"harvey1\"/> which centered around high interest rates that are widely credited with ending the high levels of inflation seen in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hutchinson

interest rates to counter inflation that had spiraled to over 600%.<ref name=\":4\"/> This helped to successfully reduce inflation to below 10%,<ref name=\":4\"/> but also resulted in job losses.\n\n===The Washington Consensus===\n{{Main |Washington Consensus}}\n{{See also |Structural adjustment}}\nThe Washington Consensus is a set of standardized policy prescriptions developed by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[World Bank]], and the [[US Department of Treasury]] for crisis-wracked developing countries, and is often associated with neoliberalism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hurt |first1=Stephen R. |title=Washington Consensus |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Washington-consensus |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> These prescriptions, often attached as conditions for loans from the IMF and World Bank, focus on market [[liberalization]], and in particular on lowering [[barriers to trade]], controlling [[inflation]], privatizing [[state-owned enterprise]]s, and reducing government budget deficits.\n\n==Criticism==\nNeoliberalism has its share of criticism in both [[left-wing politics|left]] and [[right-wing

This was said to be a sign of mourning.\n\n[[Charles Gabriel Seligman]] came into contact with the Motu, in 1904. He noted that, unlike many of their neighbors in the region, the Motu did not practice [[exogamy]].
