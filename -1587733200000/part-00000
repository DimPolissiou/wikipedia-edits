Vishnu was not pleased and Lakshmi, his consort was not convinced with Vishnu testing Karthama. She hid herself in the lotus tank at this place. Vishnu came in search of her and after finding her, he took her to Vaikunta. It is believed that Vishnu is sported in hugging posture in the nearby Thirungari also on account of the legend. Karthama took many births during various ages like [[Treta Yuga]] and [[Dwapara Yuga]], but Vishnu told him that he would get Moksha only during [[Kali Yuga]].

Beside the opcode itself, most instructions also specify the data they will process, in the form of [[operand]]s. In addition to opcodes used in the [[instruction set architecture]]s of various [[CPU]]s, which are hardware devices, they can also be used in [[virtual machine#Process virtual|abstract computing machines]] as part of their [[byte code]] specifications.\n\n==Overview==\nSpecifications and format of the opcodes are laid out in the instruction set architecture ([[instruction set architecture|ISA]]) of the processor in question, which may be a general [[central processing unit|CPU]] or a more specialized processing unit.<ref name=\"Hennessy_2017\"/> Opcodes for a given instruction set can be described through the use of an [[opcode table]] detailing all possible opcode bytes. Apart from the opcode itself, an instruction normally also has one or more specifiers for [[operand]]s (i.e. data) on which the operation should act, although some operations may have ''implicit'' operands, or none at all.<ref name=\"Hennessy_2017\"/> There are instruction sets with nearly uniform fields for opcode and operand specifiers, as well as others (the [[x86]] architecture for instance) with a more complicated, variable-length structure.<ref name=\"Hennessy_2017\"/><ref name=\"Mansfield_1983\"/> Instruction sets can be extended through the use of [[opcode prefix]]es which add a subset of new instructions made up of existing opcodes following reserved byte sequences.\n===Operands===\nDepending on architecture, the ''operands'' may be [[processor register|register]] values, values in the [[call stack|stack]], other [[memory]] values, [[I/O]] ports (which may also be [[Memory-mapped I/O|memory mapped]]), etc., specified and accessed using more or less complex [[addressing mode]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The types of ''operations'' include [[arithmetic]]s, data copying, [[logical operation]]s, and program control, as well as special instructions (such as [[CPUID]] and others).<ref name=\"Hennessy_2017\"/>\n\n[[Assembly language]], or just ''assembly'', is a [[low-level programming language]], which uses [[Assembly languctions and operands to represent [[machine code]].<ref name=\"Hennessy_2017\"/> This enhances the readability while still giving precise control over the machine instructions. Most programming is currently done using [[high-level programming language]]s,<ref name=\"langpop\"/> which are typically easier to read and write.<ref name=\"Hennessy_2017\"/> These languages need to be compiled (translated into assembly language) by a [[Operating system|system]]-specific [[compiler]], or run through other compiled programs.<ref name=\"Swanson_2001\"/>\n\n=={{Anchor|SIS}}Software instruction sets==\nOpcodes can also be found in so-called [[byte code]]s and other representations intended for a software interpreter rather than a hardware device. These software-based instruction sets often employ slightly higher-level data types and operations than most hardware counterparts, but are nevertheless constructed along similar lines. Examples include the byte code found in [[Java class file]]s which are then interpreted by the [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM), the byte code used in [[GNU Emacs]] for compiled [[LISP]] code, .NET [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL), and many others.<ref name=\"bytecode\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n* [[Gadget (machine instruction sequence)]]\n* [[Illegal opcode]]\n* [[Opcode database]]\n* [[Syllable (computing)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|40em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Barron_1978_Opcode\">{{cite book |author-first=David William |author-last=Barron |author-link=David W.

Beside the opcode itself, most instructions also specify the data they will process, in the form of [[operand]]s. In addition to opcodes used in the [[instruction set architecture]]s of various [[CPU]]s, which are hardware devices, they can also be used in [[virtual machine#Process virtual|abstract computing machines]] as part of their [[byte code]] specifications.\n\n==Overview==\nSpecifications and format of the opcodes are laid out in the instruction set architecture ([[instruction set architecture|ISA]]) of the processor in question, which may be a general [[central processing unit|CPU]] or a more specialized processing unit.<ref name=\"Hennessy_2017\"/> Opcodes for a given instruction set can be described through the use of an [[opcode table]] detailing all possible opcode bytes. Apart from the opcode itself, an instruction normally also has one or more specifiers for [[operand]]s (i.e. data) on which the operation should act, although some operations may have ''implicit'' operands, or none at all.<ref name=\"Hennessy_2017\"/> There are instruction sets with nearly uniform fields for opcode and operand specifiers, as well as others (the [[x86]] architecture for instance) with a more complicated, variable-length structure.<ref name=\"Hennessy_2017\"/><ref name=\"Mansfield_1983\"/> Instruction sets can be extended through the use of [[opcode prefix]]es which add a subset of new instructions made up of existing opcodes following reserved byte sequences.\n===Operands===\nDepending on architecture, the ''operands'' may be [[processor register|register]] values, values in the [[call stack|stack]], other [[memory]] values, [[I/O]] ports (which may also be [[Memory-mapped I/O|memory mapped]]), etc., specified and accessed using more or less complex [[addressing mode]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The types of ''operations'' include [[arithmetic]]s, data copying, [[logical operation]]s, and program control, as well as special instructions (such as [[CPUID]] and others).<ref name=\"Hennessy_2017\"/>\n\n[[Assembly language]], or just ''assembly'', is a [[low-level programming language]], which uses [[Assembly language#Opcode mnemonics and extended mnemonics|mnemonic]]s, instructions and operands to represent [[machine code]].<ref name=\"Hennessy_2017\"/> This enhances the readability while still giving precise control over the machine instructions. Most programming is currently done using [[high-level programming language]]s,<ref name=\"langpop\"/> which are typically easier to read and write.<ref name=\"Hennessy_2017\"/> These languages need to be compiled (translated into assembly language) by a [[Operating system|system]]-specific [[compiler]], or run through other compiled programs.<ref name=\"Swanson_2001\"/>\n\n=={{Anchor|SIS}}Software instruction sets==\nOpcodes can also be found in so-called [[byte code]]s and other representations intended for a software interpreter rather than a hardware device. These software-based instruction sets often employ slightly higher-level data types and operations than most hardware counterparts, but are nevertheless constructed along similar lines. Examples include the byte code found in [[Java class file]]s which are then interpreted by the [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM), the byte code used in [[GNU Emacs]] for compiled [[LISP]] code, .NET [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL), and many others.<ref name=\"bytecode\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n* [[Gadget (machine instruction sequence)]]\n* [[Illegal opcode]]\n* [[Opcode database]]\n* [[Syllable (computing)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|40em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Barron_1978_Opcode\">{{cite book |author-first=David William |author-last=Barron |author-link=David W.

Positional tracking registers the exact position due to recognition of the rotation ([[Aircraft principal axes|pitch, yaw and roll]]) and recording of the translational movements. Since [[virtual reality]] is about emulating and altering reality it's important that we can track accurately how objects (like the head or the hands) move in real life in order to represent them inside VR.\nDefining the position and orientation of a real object in space is determined with the help of special sensors or markers. [[Sensor|Sensors]] record the signal from the real object when it moves or is moved and transmit the received information to the computer.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Positional tracking in virtual reality.png|thumb|Positional tracking in virtual reality]]\n\n== Wireless tracking ==\nWireless tracking uses a set of anchors that are placed around the perimeter of the tracking space and one or more tags that are tracked. This system is similar in concept to GPS, but works both indoors and outdoors. Sometimes referred to as indoor GPS. The tags [[triangulation (computer vision)|triangulate]] their 3D position using the anchors placed around the perimeter. A wireless technology called Ultra Wideband has enabled the position tracking to reach a precision of under 100 mm. By using sensor fusion and high speed algorithms, the tracking precision can reach 5 mm level with update speeds of 200 Hz or 5 ms [[Latency (engineering)|latency]].<ref>{{cite web|title=IndoTraq|url=http://indotraq.com/?page_id=122}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hands-On With Indotraq|url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2016/01/hands-on-with-indotraq/|website=VR Focus|publisher=VR Focus}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=INDOTRAQ INDOOR TRACKING FOR VIRTUAL REALITY|url=https://blog.abt.com/2016/01/ces-2016-indotraq-indoor-tracking-for-virtual-reality/|website=abt.com|publisher=ABT}}</ref>\n\n== Optical tracking ==\nOptical methods represent a set of [[Computer vision|computer vision algorithms]] and tracking devices such as a camera of visible or [[infrared]] range, a stereo camera and a [[depth camera]]. Optical tracking is based on the same principle as [[Stereopsis|stereoscopic human vision]]. When a person looks at an object using binocular vision, he is able to define approximately at what distance the object is placed.\nNot enough just to install a pair of cameras to simulate stereoscopic vision of a person. Cameras have to determine the distance to the object and its position in space, so it's necessary to [[Calibration|calibrate]]. Infants learn to calibrate their vision when they try to take something, correlating the location of the object with outstretched hand.\n[[Motion_capture#Optical_systems|Optical systems]] are reliable and relatively non-expensive but it's difficult to calibrate. Furthermore, the system requires a direct line of light without occlusions, otherwise we receive wrong data.\nThere are two approaches:\n* Inside-out tracking: the camera is based on the tracked device and the infrared markers are placed in stationary locations. This technology is used in [[Tango (platform)|Project Tango]] ([[Simultaneous localization and mapping|SLAM]])<ref>{{cite news\n|author = Dieter Bohn\n| title = Slamdance: inside the weird virtual reality of Google's Project Tango\n| date=May 29, 2015\n| newspaper = The Verge\n| url = https://www.theverge.com/a/sundars-google/project-tango-google-io-2015\n| accessdate = April 10, 2017\n}}</ref>\n* Outside-in tracking: the camera (or several cameras) is placed in a stationary location and the infrared markers are placed on the tracked device. Outside-in approach implies the presence of an external observer (the camera) that determines the position of a moving object by the characteristic points. Technology is usually used in [[Luxury goods|high-end]] VR systems.\n\n=== Tracking With Markers ===\nIn this method, a target is fitted with markers which form a known pattern. Sources of infrared light (active and passive), the visible markers like [[QR code|QR codes]] (or they can be circular) typically serve as markers for optical tracking. A camera or multiple cameras constantly seek the markers and then use various algorithms (for example, [[3D pose estimation|POSIT algorithm]]) to extract the position of the object from the markers. Such algorithms have to also contend with missing data in case one or more of the markers is outside the camera view or is temporarily obstructed.\nMarkers can be active or passive. The former are typically infrared lights that periodically flash or glow all the time. By synchronizing the time that they are on with the camera, it is easier to block out other IR lights in the tracking area. The latter are [[retroreflectors|retroreflector]] which reflect the IR light back towards the source almost without scattering.<ref>{{cite news\n| author = Michael Mehling\n| title = Implementation of a Low Cost Marker Based Infrared Optical Tracking System\n| date=February 26, 2006\n| url = https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/PubDat_210294.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Markerless Tracking ===\nIt's possible to perform [[markerless tracking]] which continuously searches and compares the image with the known [[3D modeling|3D model]] if the geometri\u0441 characteristics of the target is known (for instance, from a [[Computer-aided design|CAD model]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== Inertial Tracking ==\nInertial tracking use data from [[Accelerometer|accelerometers]] and [[Gyroscope|gyroscopes]]. Accelerometers measure linear acceleration. Since the derivative of position with respect to time is velocity and the derivative of velocity is acceleration, the output of the accelerometer could be integrated to find the velocity and then integrated again to find the position relative to some initial point. [[Gyroscope|Gyroscopes]] measure [[angular velocity]]. Angular velocity can be integrated as well to determine angular position relatively to the initial point.\nModern [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measurement units systems (IMU)]] are based on [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS technology]] allows to track the orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) in space with high update rates and minimal latency.\nBut it is hard to rely only on inertial tracking to determine the precise position because [[dead reckoning]] leads to drift, so this one is not used in isolation in virtual reality.\n\n== Sensor Fusion ==\n[[Sensor fusion]] combines data from several tracking algorithms and can yield better outputs than only one technology. One of the variants of sensor fusion is to merge inertial and optical tracking. While optical tracking would be the main tracking method, but when an occlusion occurs, inertial tracking would estimate the position till the objects would visible to the optical camera again. Inertial tracking could also generate position data in-between optical tracking position data because inertial tracking has higher [[Frame rate|update rate]]. Optical tracking helps to cope with a drift of inertial tracking.\n\n== Acoustic Tracking ==\nAn acoustic tracking system is copied from the nature systems of positioning and orientation. Bats or dolphins navigate in space using [[ultrasound]].\nAcoustic tracking measures the time during which a particular acoustic signal reaches the [[Radio receiver|receiver]]. There are two ways to determine the position of the object: to measure time-of-flight of the sound wave from the [[transmitter]] to the receivers or the phase coherence of the sinusoidal sound wave by receiving the transfer. The main problem with the phase coherence approach is the absolute position of the object is not known but only periodic changes in its location in separate periods of time. \n\nPros:\n* Good accuracy of measurement of coordinates and angles\n* Ability to build almost any working area\n\nCons:\n* Requires a direct line of sight between emitters and receivers\n* Low speed of ultrasound, which can add latency if the emitters are moving\n* Low update rates, unless sensor fusion is used to augment the ultrasound measurements\n* Decrease of accuracy due to temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mazuryk|first1=Tomasz|title=Virtual Reality History, Applications, Technology and Future|date=1996|pages=22\u201323|url=https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/1996/mazuryk-1996-VRH/TR-186-2-96-06Paper.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Magnetic Tracking ==\n''Magnetic tracking'' (or ''electromagnetic tracking'') is based on the same principle as a [[theremin]]. It relies on measuring the intensity of inhomogenous [[magnetic field|magnetic fields]] with electromagnetic sensors. A [[base station]], often referred to as the system's ''transmitter'' or ''field generator'', generates an [[alternating current|alternating]] or a [[direct current|static]] electromagnetic field, depending on the system's architecture.\n\nTo cover all directions in the three dimensional space, three magnetic fields are generated sequentially.\nThe magnetic fields are generated by three electromagnetic coils which are perpendicular to each other. These coils should be put in a small housing mounted on a moving target which position is necessary to track. Current, sequentially passing through the coils, turns them into electromagnets, which allows to determine their position and orientation in space. Magnetic tracking has been implemented by Polhemus and in [[Razer Hydra|Razor Hydra by Sixense]].<ref>{{cite news\n| author = Tomasz Mazuryk and Michael Gervautz\n| title = Virtual Reality History, Applications, Technology and Future\n| date=1996\n| url = https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/1996/mazuryk-1996-VRH/TR-186-2-96-06Paper.pdf\n}}</ref>\nThe system works poorly near any electrically conductive material, such as metal objects and devices, that can affect an electromagnetic field.

The main problem with the phase coherence approach is the absolute position of the object is not known but only periodic changes in its location in separate periods of time. \n\nPros:\n* Good accuracy of measurement of coordinates and angles\n* Ability to build almost any working area\n\nCons:\n* Requires a direct line of sight between emitters and receivers\n* Low speed of ultrasound, which can add latency if the emitters are moving\n* Low update rates, unless sensor fusion is used to augment the ultrasound measurements\n* Decrease of accuracy due to temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mazuryk|first1=Tomasz|title=Virtual Reality History, Applications, Technology and Future|date=1996|pages=22\u201323|url=https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/1996/mazuryk-1996-VRH/TR-186-2-96-06Paper.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Magnetic Tracking ==\n''Magnetic tracking'' (or ''electromagnetic tracking'') is based on the same principle as a [[theremin]]. It relies on measuring the intensity of inhomogenous [[magnetic field|magnetic fields]] with electromagnetic sensors. A [[base station]], often referred to as the system's ''transmitter'' or ''field generator'', generates an [[alternating current|alternating]] or a [[direct current|static]] electromagnetic field, depending on the system's architecture.\n\nTo cover all directions in the three dimensional space, three magnetic fields are generated sequentially.\nThe magnetic fields are generated by three electromagnetic coils which are perpendicular to each other. These coils should be put in a small housing mounted on a moving target which position is necessary to track. Current, sequentially passing through the coils, turns them into electromagnets, which allows to determine their position and orientation in space. Magnetic tracking has been implemented by Polhemus and in [[Razer Hydra|Razor Hydra by Sixense]].<ref>{{cite news\n| author = Tomasz Mazuryk and Michael Gervautz\n| title = Virtual Reality History, Applications, Technology and Future\n| date=1996\n| url = https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/1996/mazuryk-1996-VRH/TR-186-2-96-06Paper.pdf\n}}</ref>\nThe system works poorly near any electrically conductive material, such as metal objects and devices, that can affect an electromagnetic field.
