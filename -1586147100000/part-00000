It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=314 562 846-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/> The decision to release the single allowed Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song. To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. She decided to write an uptempo love song rather than a [[Sentimental ballad|ballad]], inspired by Segal finding her love for Murphy's unattractive character in the film convincing.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref>\n\n{{listen|pos=right|filename=Janet - Doesn't Really Matter.ogg |title=\"Doesn't Really Matter\"|description=The lyrics were initially written by Jackson as a poem, before being implemented into the song.

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=314 562 846-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/> The decision to release the single allowed Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

Jam noted that Jackson wrote lyrics for the song over one night, while he came up with the melody alongside drum programmer Alex Richburg, which was initially conceived as a \"slow melody\" but decided to be sped up.<ref name=\"Bronson\"/> Two different choruses were written by Jam and Jackson; Jam wrote 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you' while Jackson wrote 'Doesn't really matter'. Both Jam and Jackson decided to use Jackson's chorus, which Jackson also decided to include Jam's chorus towards the end of the song after she did not want to discard it.<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs to Segal on May 12, 2000, three days prior to his set deadline for the soundtrack, which he chose \"Doesn't Really Matter\", believing that it was a better fit and a \"summertime record\". A slightly modified version was included on ''All for You'', featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by [[Rockwilder]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\n==Composition==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" is lyrically inspired by Jackson's character in the film, who falls in love with the main character.

''His academic essays have appeared in [[The British Journal for the History of Science|''The British Journal for the History of Science'']]'', Endeavour,'' and the [[Cambridge University Press]] anthology ''George Eliot In Context, among others.''\n\n===Research contributions===\nRectenwald has written extensively on the origins of the movement called [[secularism]], which was founded in London in 1851 by [[George Jacob Holyoake]].<ref>Holyoake, G.J.

Scientific naturalism is noteworthy for being the philosophical basis of \"the Darwinian circle,\" i.e., the 19th century scientists of note most responsible for the general acceptance of [[Charles Darwin]]\u2019s theory of evolution via natural selection.<ref>Stanley, Matthew. (2015) ''Huxley\u2019s Church and Maxwell\u2019s Demon: From Theistic Science to Naturalistic Science'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press); Lightman, Bernard V. and M. S. Reidy (eds.).

Rectenwald concludes that such ideology has promoted an authoritarian and dogmatic culture in parts of the academy.<ref>{{cite news |last=Messenger |first=Stephen |date=July 30, 2018 |title=Springtime for Snowflakes: \"Social Justice\" and Its Postmodern Parentage: A Review |url=https://areomagazine.com/2018/07/30/springtime-for-snowflakes-social-justice-and-its-postmodern-parentage-a-review/ |work=Areo |location= |access-date=February 21, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Vigo |first=Julian |date=August 2, 2018 |title=Springtime for Snowflakes: An NYU Professor Takes On Academia's \"Social Justice Warriors\" |url=https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2018/08/39338/ |work=[[Public Discourse (journal)|Public Discourse]] |location=[[Princeton, New Jersey]] |access-date=February 21, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Tapson |first=Mark |date=July 27, 2018 |title=Springtime for Snowflakes; professor's memoir of the closing of the American mind |url=https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/270828/springtime-snowflakes-mark-tapson |work=[[FrontPage Magazine]] |location=[[Sherman Oaks, California]] |access-date=February 21, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Books===\n* ''The Eros of the Baby Boom Eras''.

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.
