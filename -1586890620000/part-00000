Phil Kollin of Winchelsea, England, was the series grand prize winner, taking home over \u00a323,000 over a series of games. The audience at home was in a separate interactive competition, which was won by Hannah Withey of Cheshire.\n\nLater in 2005, the [[BBC]] launched ''[[SUDO-Q]]'', a [[game show]] that combined Sudoku with general knowledge. However, it used only 4\u00d74 and 6\u00d76 puzzles. Four seasons were produced before the show ended in 2007.\n\nIn 2006, a Sudoku website published songwriter Peter Levy's Sudoku tribute song,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sudoku.org.uk/news.htm |title=Sudoku the song, by Peter Levy |date=August 17, 2006 |work=Sudoku.org.uk |accessdate=October 5, 2008}}</ref> but quickly had to take down the [[MP3 file]] due to heavy traffic. British and Australian radio picked up the song, which is to feature in a British-made Sudoku documentary. The Japanese Embassy also nominated the song for an award, with Levy doing talks with Sony in Japan to release the song as a single.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/hit-song-has-the-numbers/story-e6frf7jo-1111112155196 |title=Hit Song Has the Numbers |date=August 17, 2006 |work=[[The Herald Sun]] |accessdate=October 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSudoku software is very popular on PCs, websites, and mobile phones. It comes with many distributions of [[Linux]]. Software has also been released on video game consoles, such as the [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation Portable]], the [[Game Boy Advance]], Xbox Live Arcade, the [[Nook]] e-book reader, Kindle Fire tablet, several [[iPod]] models, and the [[iPhone]]. Many [[Nokia]] phones also had Sudoku. In fact, just two weeks after [[Apple Inc.]] debuted the online [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] within its [[iTunes Store]] on July 11, 2008, nearly 30 different Sudoku games were already in it, created by various software developers, specifically for the iPhone and iPod Touch. One of the most popular video games featuring Sudoku is ''[[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!]]''. Critically and commercially well-received, it generated particular praise for its Sudoku implementation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/931667.asp |title=Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day! |website=Gamerankings.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/brainagetrainyourbraininminutesaday/review.html |title=Brain Age: ...

Some of the spaces are filled with a digit; others are blank spaces to be solved.|alt2=The previous puzzle, solved with digits in the blanks spaces.}}\n\n=== Variations of grid sizes or region shapes ===\nAlthough the 9\u00d79 grid with 3\u00d73 regions is by far the most common, many other variations exist. Sample puzzles can be 4\u00d74 grids with 2\u00d72 regions; 5\u00d75 grids with ''[[pentomino]]'' regions have been published under the name Logi-5; the [[World Puzzle Championship]] has featured a 6\u00d76 grid with 2\u00d73 regions and a 7\u00d77 grid with six ''[[heptomino]]'' regions and a disjoint region. Larger grids are also possible, or different irregular shapes (under various names: ''Suguru'',''Tectonic'',''jigsaw Sudoku''...). ''The Times'' offers a 12\u00d712-grid \"Dodeka Sudoku\" with 12 regions of 4\u00d73 squares. Dell Magazines regularly publishes 16\u00d716 \"Number Place Challenger\" puzzles (using the numbers 1\u201316 or the letters A-P). Nikoli offers 25\u00d725 \"Sudoku the Giant\" behemoths. A 100\u00d7100-grid puzzle dubbed Sudoku-zilla was published in 2010.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eisenhauer |first=William |title=Sudoku-zilla |year=2010 |publisher=CreateSpace |page=220 |isbn=978-1-4515-1049-2}}</ref>\n\n==== Mini Sudoku ====\n\nUnder the name \"Mini Sudoku\", a 6\u00d76 variant with 3\u00d72 regions appears in the American newspaper ''[[USA Today]]'' and elsewhere. The object is the same as that of standard Sudoku, but the puzzle only uses the numbers 1 through 6. A similar form, for younger solvers of puzzles, called \"The Junior Sudoku\", has appeared in some newspapers, such as some editions of ''The Daily Mail''.\n\n=== Imposing additional constraints ===\nAnother common variant is to add limits on the placement of numbers beyond the usual row, column, and box requirements. Often, the limit takes the form of an extra \"dimension\"; the most common is to require the numbers in the main diagonals of the grid to also be unique. The aforementioned \"Number Place Challenger\" puzzles are all of this variant, as are the Sudoku X puzzles in ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', which use 6\u00d76 grids.\n\n=== Killer Sudoku ===\n{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal|align=right|image1=Killersudoku color.svg|image2=Killersudoku  color solution.svg|width=150|caption1=A Killer Sudoku puzzle|caption2=And its solution}}\n{{Main|Killer sudoku}}\n\nThe Killer Sudoku variant combines elements of Sudoku and [[Kakuro]].\n\n=== Alphabetical Sudoku ===\n{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal|align=right|image1=Wordoku puzzle.svg|image2=Wordoku puzzle solution.svg|width=150|caption1=A Wordoku puzzle|caption2=And its solution (red characters)}}\n\nAlphabetical variations have emerged, sometimes called Wordoku; no functional difference exists in the puzzle unless the letters spell something. Some variants, such as in the ''[[TV Guide]]'', include a word reading along a main diagonal, row, or column once solved; determining the word in advance can be viewed as a solving aid. A Wordoku might contain words other than the main word.\n\n\"''Quadratum latinum''\" is a Sudoku variation with Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, ..., IX) proposed by ''[[Hebdomada aenigmatum]]'', a monthly magazine of Latin puzzles and crosswords. Like the Wordoku, it presents no functional difference from a normal Sudoku, but adds the visual difficulty of using Roman numerals.\n\n=== Hyper Sudoku ===\n{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal|align=right|image1=Oceans Hypersudoku18 Puzzle.svg|image2=Oceans Hypersudoku18 Solution.svg|width=150|caption1=Hypersudoku puzzle|caption2=And its solution|alt1=A Sudoku puzzle grid with four blue quadrants and nine rows and nine columns that intersect at square spaces. Some of the spaces are filled with one number each; others are blank spaces to be solved.|alt2=The previous puzzle, solved with numbers in the blanks spaces.}}\n\nHyper Sudoku uses the classic 9\u00d79 grid with 3\u00d73 regions, but defines four additional interior 3\u00d73 regions in which the numbers 1\u20139 must appear exactly once. It was invented by ''Peter Ritmeester'' and first published by him in Dutch Newspaper ''NRC Handelsblad'' in October 2005, and since April 2007 on a daily basis in ''The International New York Times'' (International Herald Tribune). The first time it was called Hyper Sudoku was in ''Will Shortz's Favorite Sudoku Variations'' (February 2006). It is also known as Windoku because with the grid's four interior regions shaded, it resembles a window with glazing bars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sudoku-space.com/hyper-sudoku/hyper-sudoku.php |publisher=www.sudoku-space.com |title=What is Hyper Sudoku?|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Twin Sudoku ===\nIn Twin Sudoku two regular grids share a 3\u00d73 box. This is one of many possible types of [[Glossary of Sudoku#Sudoku variants|overlapping grids]]. The rules for each individual grid are the same as in normal Sudoku, but the digits in the overlapping section are shared by each half. In some compositions neither individual grid can be solved alone \u2013 the complete solution is only possible after each individual grid has at least been partially solved.\n\n=== Other variants===\nPuzzles constructed from more than two grids are also common. Five 9\u00d79 grids that overlap at the corner regions in the shape of a ''[[quincunx]]'' is known in Japan as ''Gattai'' 5 (five merged) Sudoku. In ''The Times'', ''[[The Age]]'', and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', this form of puzzle is known as Samurai SuDoku. ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' and the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' publish a puzzle of this variant (titled High Five) in their Sunday edition. Often, no givens are placed in the overlapping regions. Sequential grids, as opposed to overlapping, are also published, with values in specific locations in grids needing to be transferred to others.\n\n[[File:Comparison Sudoku.png|thumb|250px|An example of Greater Than Sudoku]]\nA tabletop version of Sudoku can be played with a standard 81-card Set deck (see [[Set game]]). A three-dimensional Sudoku puzzle was published in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in May 2005. ''The Times'' also publishes a three-dimensional version under the name Tredoku. Also, a Sudoku version of the [[Rubik's Cube]] is named [[Sudoku Cube]].\n\nMany other variants have been developed.<ref>*{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Thomas |last2=Huang |first2=Wei-Hwa |title=Mutant Sudoku |publisher=Puzzlewright Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-402765025}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Conceptis |first=Puzzles |title=Amazing Sudoku Variants |publisher=Puzzlewright |year=2013 |isbn=978-1454906520}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Murali |first=A V |title=A Collection of Fascinating Games and Puzzles |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |year=2014 |isbn=978-1500216429}}</ref> Some are different shapes in the arrangement of overlapping 9\u00d79 grids, such as butterfly, windmill, or flower.<ref name=\"ja1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Zahlenraetsel.htm |title=Zahlenraetsel |publisher=www.janko.at}}</ref> Others vary the logic for solving the grid. One of these is \"Greater Than Sudoku\". In this, a 3\u00d73 grid of the Sudoku is given with 12 symbols of Greater Than (>) or Less Than (<) on the common line of the two adjacent numbers.<ref name=\"Garns\"/> Another variant on the logic of solution is \"Clueless Sudoku\", in which nine 9\u00d79 Sudoku grids are each placed in a 3\u00d73 array. The center cell in each 3\u00d73 grid of all nine puzzles is left blank and form a tenth Sudoku puzzle without any cell completed; hence, \"clueless\".<ref name=\"ja1\"/> A new variant mixes Sudoku with the sliding tile puzzle in Sudoku Slide Extreme. In this variant all all of the positions are filled in. Tiles are moved to the proper position to solve the puzzle. This variant contains power-ups and a campaign mode.{{fact|date=November 2019}} Examples and other variants can be found in the [[Glossary of Sudoku]].\n\n== Mathematics of Sudoku ==\n[[File:Sudoku Puzzle (an automorphic puzzle with 18 clues).svg|thumb|220px|An [[Mathematics of Sudoku#Automorphic Sudokus|automorphic]] Sudoku with 18 clues and two-way diagonal symmetry.]]\n\n{{Main|Mathematics of Sudoku}}\n\nThis section refers to classic Sudoku, disregarding jigsaw, hyper, and other variants.\n\nA completed Sudoku grid is a special type of [[Latin square]] with the additional property of no repeated values in any of the nine blocks (or ''boxes'' of 3\u00d73 cells).

The maximum number of clues that can be provided while still not rendering a unique solution is four short of a full grid (77); if two instances of two numbers each are missing from cells that occupy the corners of an orthogonal rectangle, and exactly two of these cells are within one region, the numbers can be assigned two ways. Since this applies to Latin squares in general, most variants of Sudoku have the same maximum.\n\nThe number of classic 9\u00d79 Sudoku solution grids is 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 {{OEIS|id=A107739}}, or around {{val|6.67|e=21}}.

The objective is to fill a 9\u00d79 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3\u00d73 subgrids that compose the grid (also called \"boxes\", \"blocks\", or \"regions\") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. \n\nCompleted games are always an example of a [[Latin square]] which include an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions. For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in the same row, column, or any of the nine 3\u00d73 subregions of the 9\u00d79 playing board.\n\nFrench newspapers featured variations of the Sudoku puzzles in the 19th century, and the puzzle has appeared since 1979 in [[puzzle book]]s under the name Number Place.<ref name=Smith /> However, the modern Sudoku only began to gain widespread popularity in 1986 when it was published by the Japanese puzzle company [[Nikoli (publisher)|Nikoli]] under the name Sudoku, meaning \"single number\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Unwed Numbers |first=Brian |last=Hayes |journal=American Scientist |volume=94 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=12\u201315 |doi=10.1511/2006.57.3475}}</ref> It first appeared in a U.S. newspaper, and then ''[[The Times]]'' (London), in 2004, thanks to the efforts of [[Wayne Gould]], who devised a computer program to rapidly produce unique puzzles.\n\n== History of sudoku ==\n[[File:Sudoku.jpg|thumb|upright|From ''La France'' newspaper, July 6, 1895: The puzzle instructions read, \"Use the numbers 1 to 9 each nine times to complete the grid in such a way that the horizontal, vertical, and two main diagonal lines all add up to the same total.\"]]\n\n===Predecessors===\nNumber puzzles appeared in newspapers in the late 19th century, when French puzzle setters began experimenting with removing numbers from [[magic squares]]. ''[[Le Si\u00e8cle]]'', a Paris daily, published a partially completed 9\u00d79 magic square with 3\u00d73 subsquares on November 19, 1892.<ref name=\"Le_Si\u00e8cle_185672\">{{cite journal\n|last=Boyer\n|first=Christian\n|date=May 2006\n|title=Suppl\u00e9ment de l'article \"Les anc\u00eatres fran\u00e7ais du sudoku\"\n|journal=Pour la Science\n|pages=1\u20136\n|url=http://cboyer.club.fr/multimagie/SupplAncetresSudoku.pdf\n|accessdate=August 3, 2009\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210103525/http://cboyer.club.fr/multimagie/SupplAncetresSudoku.pdf\n|archivedate=December 10, 2006\n|language=French\n}}</ref> It was not a Sudoku because it contained double-digit numbers and required arithmetic rather than logic to solve, but it shared key characteristics: each row, column and subsquare added up to the same number.\n\nOn July 6, 1895, ''Le Si\u00e8cle''{{'s}} rival, ''[[La France (French newspaper)|La France]]'', refined the puzzle so that it was almost a modern Sudoku. It simplified the 9\u00d79 magic square puzzle so that each row, column, and [[broken diagonal]]s contained only the numbers 1\u20139, but did not mark the subsquares. Although they are unmarked, each 3\u00d73 subsquare does indeed comprise the numbers 1\u20139 and the additional constraint on the broken diagonals leads to only one solution.<ref>{{cite web\n|last=Boyer\n|first=Christian\n|title=Sudoku's French ancestors\n|url=http://cboyer.club.fr/multimagie//English/SudokuAncestors.htm\n|year=2007\n|publisher=(personal webpage)\n|accessdate=August 3, 2009\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010081626/http://cboyer.club.fr/multimagie/English/SudokuAncestors.htm\n|archivedate=October 10, 2007\n|language=French\n}}</ref>\n\nThese weekly puzzles were a feature of French newspapers such as ''L'Echo de Paris'' for about a decade, but disappeared about the time of [[World War I]].<ref name=L>{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Malvern |title=Les fiendish French beat us to Su Doku |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2208881,00.html |work=Times Online |date=June 3, 2006 |accessdate=September 16, 2006 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Sudoku===\nThe modern Sudoku was most likely designed anonymously by [[Howard Garns]], a 74-year-old retired architect and freelance puzzle constructor from [[Connersville, Indiana]], and first published in 1979 by [[Dell Magazines]] as Number Place (the earliest known examples of modern Sudoku).<ref name=\"time magazine\"/> Garns's name was always present on the list of contributors in issues of ''Dell Pencil Puzzles and Word Games'' that included Number Place, and was always absent from issues that did not.<ref name=\"Garns\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mathpuzzle.com/MAA/41-Sudoku%20Variations/mathgames_09_05_05.html |title=Ed Pegg Jr.'s Math Games: Sudoku Variations |accessdate=October 3, 2006 |last=Pegg |first=Ed Jr. |date=September 15, 2005 |work=MAA Online |publisher=[[The Mathematical Association of America]]}}</ref> He died in 1989 before getting a chance to see his creation as a worldwide phenomenon.<ref name=\"Garns\"/> Whether or not Garns was familiar with any of the French newspapers listed above is unclear.\n\nThe puzzle was introduced in Japan by Nikoli in the paper ''Monthly Nikolist'' in April 1984<ref name=\"Garns\"/> as {{nihongo|''S\u016bji wa dokushin ni kagiru''|\u6570\u5b57\u306f\u72ec\u8eab\u306b\u9650\u308b|}}, which also can be translated as \"the digits must be single\" or \"the digits are limited to one occurrence\" (In Japanese, ''dokushin'' means an \"unmarried person\").

In 1986, Nikoli introduced two innovations: the number of givens was restricted to no more than 32, and puzzles became \"symmetrical\" (meaning the givens were distributed in [[Rotational symmetry|rotationally symmetric cells]]). It is now published in mainstream Japanese periodicals, such as the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]''.\n\nCognitive scientist Jeremy Grabbe found that Sudoku involved an area of cognition called working memory. A subsequent experiment by Grabbe showed that routine Sudoku playing could improve working memory in older people.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grabbe |first=Jeremy W. |date=March 9, 2017 |title=Sudoku and Changes in Working Memory Performance for Older Adults and Younger Adults |journal=[[Taylor & Francis]] |volume=41 |pages=14\u201321 |doi=10.1080/01924788.2016.1272390 }}</ref>\n\n=== Spread outside Japan ===\n\nIn 1997, Hong Kong judge [[Wayne Gould]] saw a partly completed puzzle in a Japanese bookshop. Over six years, he developed a computer program to produce unique puzzles rapidly.<ref name=Smith /> Knowing that British newspapers have a long history of publishing [[crossword]]s and other puzzles, he promoted Sudoku to ''[[The Times]]'' in Britain, which launched it on November 12, 2004 (calling it Su Doku). The first letter to ''The Times'' regarding Su Doku was published the following day on November 13 from Ian Payn of [[Brentford]], complaining that the puzzle had caused him to miss his stop on the [[London Underground|tube]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article390381.ece \"Letters\"].

From July 2005, [[Channel 4]] included a daily Sudoku game in their [[teletext]] service. On August 2, the BBC's program guide ''[[Radio Times]]'' featured a weekly Super Sudoku with a 16\u00d716 grid.\n\nIn the United States, the first newspaper to publish a Sudoku puzzle by Wayne Gould was ''[[The Conway Daily Sun]]'' (New Hampshire), in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/21/business/worldbusiness/21sudoku.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&sq&st=cse%22Conway%20Daily%20Sun&scp=1%22%202004%20gould |title=Correction attached to \"Inside Japan's Puzzle Palace\" |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SudokuLive2.jpg|thumb|The world's first live TV Sudoku show, July 1, 2005, ''[[Sky One]]'']]\n\nThe world's first live TV Sudoku show, ''Sudoku Live'', was a [[puzzle contest]] first broadcast on July 1, 2005, on [[Sky One]]. It was presented by [[Carol Vorderman]]. Nine teams of nine players (with one celebrity in each team) representing geographical regions competed to solve a puzzle. Each player had a hand-held device for entering numbers corresponding to answers for four cells. Phil Kollin of Winchelsea, England, was the series grand prize winner, taking home over \u00a323,000 over a series of games. The audience at home was in a separate interactive competition, which was won by Hannah Withey of Cheshire.\n\nLater in 2005, the [[BBC]] launched ''[[SUDO-Q]]'', a [[game show]] that combined Sudoku with general knowledge. However, it used only 4\u00d74 and 6\u00d76 puzzles. Four seasons were produced before the show ended in 2007.\n\nIn 2006, a Sudoku website published songwriter Peter Levy's Sudoku tribute song,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sudoku.org.uk/news.htm |title=Sudoku the song, by Peter Levy |date=August 17, 2006 |work=Sudoku.org.uk |accessdate=October 5, 2008}}</ref> but quickly had to take down the [[MP3 file]] due to heavy traffic. British and Australian radio picked up the song, which is to feature in a British-made Sudoku documentary. The Japanese Embassy also nominated the song for an award, with Levy doing talks with Sony in Japan to release the song as a single.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/hit-song-has-the-numbers/story-e6frf7jo-1111112155196 |title=Hit Song Has the Numbers |date=August 17, 2006 |work=[[The Herald Sun]] |accessdate=October 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSudoku software is very popular on PCs, websites, and mobile phones. It comes with many distributions of [[Linux]]. Software has also been released on video game consoles, such as the [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation Portable]], the [[Game Boy Advance]], Xbox Live Arcade, the [[Nook]] e-book reader, Kindle Fire tablet, several [[iPod]] models, and the [[iPhone]]. Many [[Nokia]] phones also had Sudoku. In fact, just two weeks after [[Apple Inc.]] debuted the online [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] within its [[iTunes Store]] on July 11, 2008, nearly 30 different Sudoku games were already in it, created by various software developers, specifically for the iPhone and iPod Touch. One of the most popular video games featuring Sudoku is ''[[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!]]''. Critically and commercially well-received, it generated particular praise for its Sudoku implementation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/931667.asp |title=Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day! |website=Gamerankings.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/brainagetrainyourbraininminutesaday/review.html |title=Brain Age: ...

Some of the spaces are filled with a digit; others are blank spaces to be solved.|alt2=The previous puzzle, solved with digits in the blanks spaces.}}\n\n=== Variations of grid sizes or region shapes ===\nAlthough the 9\u00d79 grid with 3\u00d73 regions is by far the most common, many other variations exist. Sample puzzles can be 4\u00d74 grids with 2\u00d72 regions; 5\u00d75 grids with ''[[pentomino]]'' regions have been published under the name Logi-5; the [[World Puzzle Championship]] has featured a 6\u00d76 grid with 2\u00d73 regions and a 7\u00d77 grid with six ''[[heptomino]]'' regions and a disjoint region. Larger grids are also possible, or different irregular shapes (under various names: ''Suguru'',''Tectonic'',''jigsaw Sudoku''...). ''The Times'' offers a 12\u00d712-grid \"Dodeka Sudoku\" with 12 regions of 4\u00d73 squares. Dell Magazines regularly publishes 16\u00d716 \"Number Place Challenger\" puzzles (using the numbers 1\u201316 or the letters A-P). Nikoli offers 25\u00d725 \"Sudoku the Giant\" behemoths. A 100\u00d7100-grid puzzle dubbed Sudoku-zilla was published in 2010.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eisenhauer |first=William |title=Sudoku-zilla |year=2010 |publisher=CreateSpace |page=220 |isbn=978-1-4515-1049-2}}</ref>\n\n==== Mini Sudoku ====\n\nUnder the name \"Mini Sudoku\", a 6\u00d76 variant with 3\u00d72 regions appears in the American newspaper ''[[USA Today]]'' and elsewhere. The object is the same as that of standard Sudoku, but the puzzle only uses the numbers 1 through 6. A similar form, for younger solvers of puzzles, called \"The Junior Sudoku\", has appeared in some newspapers, such as some editions of ''The Daily Mail''.\n\n=== Imposing additional constraints ===\nAnother common variant is to add limits on the placement of numbers beyond the usual row, column, and box requirements. Often, the limit takes the form of an extra \"dimension\"; the most common is to require the numbers in the main diagonals of the grid to also be unique. The aforementioned \"Number Place Challenger\" puzzles are all of this variant, as are the Sudoku X puzzles in ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', which use 6\u00d76 grids.\n\n=== Killer Sudoku ===\n{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal|align=right|image1=Killersudoku color.svg|image2=Killersudoku  color solution.svg|width=150|caption1=A Killer Sudoku puzzle|caption2=And its solution}}\n{{Main|Killer sudoku}}\n\nThe Killer Sudoku variant combines elements of Sudoku and [[Kakuro]].\n\n=== Alphabetical Sudoku ===\n{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal|align=right|image1=Wordoku puzzle.svg|image2=Wordoku puzzle solution.svg|width=150|caption1=A Wordoku puzzle|caption2=And its solution (red characters)}}\n\nAlphabetical variations have emerged, sometimes called Wordoku; no functional difference exists in the puzzle unless the letters spell something. Some variants, such as in the ''[[TV Guide]]'', include a word reading along a main diagonal, row, or column once solved; determining the word in advance can be viewed as a solving aid. A Wordoku might contain words other than the main word.\n\n\"''Quadratum latinum''\" is a Sudoku variation with Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, ..., IX) proposed by ''[[Hebdomada aenigmatum]]'', a monthly magazine of Latin puzzles and crosswords. Like the Wordoku, it presents no functional difference from a normal Sudoku, but adds the visual difficulty of using Roman numerals.\n\n=== Hyper Sudoku ===\n{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal|align=right|image1=Oceans Hypersudoku18 Puzzle.svg|image2=Oceans Hypersudoku18 Solution.svg|width=150|caption1=Hypersudoku puzzle|caption2=And its solution|alt1=A Sudoku puzzle grid with four blue quadrants and nine rows and nine columns that intersect at square spaces. Some of the spaces are filled with one number each; others are blank spaces to be solved.|alt2=The previous puzzle, solved with numbers in the blanks spaces.}}\n\nHyper Sudoku uses the classic 9\u00d79 grid with 3\u00d73 regions, but defines four additional interior 3\u00d73 regions in which the numbers 1\u20139 must appear exactly once. It was invented by ''Peter Ritmeester'' and first published by him in Dutch Newspaper ''NRC Handelsblad'' in October 2005, and since April 2007 on a daily basis in ''The International New York Times'' (International Herald Tribune). The first time it was called Hyper Sudoku was in ''Will Shortz's Favorite Sudoku Variations'' (February 2006). It is also known as Windoku because with the grid's four interior regions shaded, it resembles a window with glazing bars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sudoku-space.com/hyper-sudoku/hyper-sudoku.php |publisher=www.sudoku-space.com |title=What is Hyper Sudoku?|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Twin Sudoku ===\nIn Twin Sudoku two regular grids share a 3\u00d73 box. This is one of many possible types of [[Glossary of Sudoku#Sudoku variants|overlapping grids]]. The rules for each individual grid are the same as in normal Sudoku, but the digits in the overlapping section are shared by each half. In some compositions neither individual grid can be solved alone \u2013 the complete solution is only possible after each individual grid has at least been partially solved.\n\n=== Other variants===\nPuzzles constructed from more than two grids are also common. Five 9\u00d79 grids that overlap at the corner regions in the shape of a ''[[quincunx]]'' is known in Japan as ''Gattai'' 5 (five merged) Sudoku. In ''The Times'', ''[[The Age]]'', and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', this form of puzzle is known as Samurai SuDoku. ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' and the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' publish a puzzle of this variant (titled High Five) in their Sunday edition. Often, no givens are placed in the overlapping regions. Sequential grids, as opposed to overlapping, are also published, with values in specific locations in grids needing to be transferred to others.\n\n[[File:Comparison Sudoku.png|thumb|250px|An example of Greater Than Sudoku]]\nA tabletop version of Sudoku can be played with a standard 81-card Set deck (see [[Set game]]). A three-dimensional Sudoku puzzle was published in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in May 2005. ''The Times'' also publishes a three-dimensional version under the name Tredoku. Also, a Sudoku version of the [[Rubik's Cube]] is named [[Sudoku Cube]].\n\nMany other variants have been developed.<ref>*{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Thomas |last2=Huang |first2=Wei-Hwa |title=Mutant Sudoku |publisher=Puzzlewright Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-402765025}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Conceptis |first=Puzzles |title=Amazing Sudoku Variants |publisher=Puzzlewright |year=2013 |isbn=978-1454906520}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Murali |first=A V |title=A Collection of Fascinating Games and Puzzles |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |year=2014 |isbn=978-1500216429}}</ref> Some are different shapes in the arrangement of overlapping 9\u00d79 grids, such as butterfly, windmill, or flower.<ref name=\"ja1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Zahlenraetsel.htm |title=Zahlenraetsel |publisher=www.janko.at}}</ref> Others vary the logic for solving the grid. One of these is \"Greater Than Sudoku\". In this, a 3\u00d73 grid of the Sudoku is given with 12 symbols of Greater Than (>) or Less Than (<) on the common line of the two adjacent numbers.<ref name=\"Garns\"/> Another variant on the logic of solution is \"Clueless Sudoku\", in which nine 9\u00d79 Sudoku grids are each placed in a 3\u00d73 array. The center cell in each 3\u00d73 grid of all nine puzzles is left blank and form a tenth Sudoku puzzle without any cell completed; hence, \"clueless\".<ref name=\"ja1\"/> A new variant mixes Sudoku with the sliding tile puzzle in Sudoku Slide Extreme.

However, in Europe, these tribunals were set up under the authority of the [[London Charter]], which only considered allegations of war crimes committed by people who acted in the interests of the [[Axis powers]].\n\nSome war crimes involving Allied personnel were investigated by the Allied powers and led in some instances to [[courts-martial]]. Some incidents alleged by historians to have been crimes under the law of war in operation at the time were, for a variety of reasons, not investigated by the Allied powers during the war, or were investigated and a decision was taken not to prosecute.\n\n==Policy==\nThe [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] claim that their [[militaries]] were directed to observe the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] and [[Geneva Conventions]] and believed to be conducting a [[just war]] fought for defensive reasons.  Violations of the conventions did occur, however, including the forcible return of Soviet citizens who had been collaborating with Axis forces to the USSR at the end of the war.

Many men, some the very young and old, were killed resisting or trying to escape. Once collected, they would be roped or chained together and marched, with little food or water, long distances to camp. They often died or were killed along the way, sometimes less than 50 percent reaching camp alive. Then recruit camp was no better, with hospitals resembling Nazi concentration camps...

That same year, efforts were taken by Allied high commanders to suppress \"take no prisoners\" attitudes,<ref name=Ferguson2004/> among their own personnel (as these were affecting intelligence gathering) and to encourage Japanese soldiers to surrender. Ferguson adds that measures by Allied commanders to improve the ratio of Japanese prisoners to Japanese dead, resulted in it reaching 1:7, by mid-1945. Nevertheless, taking no prisoners was still standard practice among US troops at the [[Battle of Okinawa]], in April\u2013June 1945.<ref name=Ferguson2004/>\n\n[[Ulrich A.

At the time, there were only women, children and old people in the village, as all the young men had been mobilized for the war. Soon after landing, the Marines \"mopped up\" the entire village, but found no signs of Japanese forces. Taking advantage of the situation, they started \"hunting for women\" in broad daylight and those who were hiding in the village or nearby air raid shelters were dragged out one after another.<ref>Tanaka, Toshiyuki.

The article goes deeper into the matter and claims that the villagers' tale - true or not - is part of a 'dark, long-kept secret' the unraveling of which 'refocused attention on what historians say is one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war': \"the widespread rape of Okinawan women by American servicemen\".<ref>{{Cite news|last = Sims |first = Calvin |date = 1 June 2000 |title = 3 Dead Marines and a Secret of Wartime Okinawa |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/01/world/3-dead-marines-and-a-secret-of-wartime-okinawa.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=Nago, Japan |access-date=6 April 2015 |quote= Still, the villagers' tale of a dark, long-kept secret has refocused attention on what historians say is one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war, the widespread rape of Okinawan women by American servicemen.}}</ref> Although Japanese reports of rape were largely ignored at the time, academic estimates have been that as many as 10,000 Okinawan women may have been raped. It has been claimed that the rape was so prevalent that most Okinawans over age 65 around the year 2000 either knew or had heard of a woman who was raped in the aftermath of the war. Military officials denied the mass rapings, and all surviving veterans refused ''The New York Times''' request for an interview.<ref name=\"okinawa\">{{Cite news|last = Sims |first = Calvin |date = 1 June 2000 |title = 3 Dead Marines and a Secret of Wartime Okinawa |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/01/world/3-dead-marines-and-a-secret-of-wartime-okinawa.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=Nago, Japan |access-date=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nProfessor of East Asian Studies and expert on Okinawa Steve Rabson said: \"I have read many accounts of such rapes in Okinawan newspapers and books, but few people know about them or are willing to talk about them\". Books, diaries, articles and other documents refer to rapes by American soldiers of various races and backgrounds. Samuel Saxton, a retired captain, explained that the American veterans and witnesses may have believed: \"It would be unfair for the public to get the impression that we were all a bunch of rapists after we worked so hard to serve our country\". Masaie Ishihara, a sociology professor, supports this: \"There is a lot of historical amnesia out there, many people don't want to acknowledge what really happened\".<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nAn explanation given for why the US military has no record of any rapes is that few - if any - Okinawan women reported abuse, mostly out of fear and embarrassment. Those who did report them are believed by historians to have been ignored by the US military police. A large scale effort to determine the extent of such crimes has also never been called for. Over five decades after the war has ended the women who were believed to have been raped still refused to give a public statement, with friends, local historians and university professors who had spoken with the women instead saying they preferred not to discuss it publicly. According to a [[Nago, Okinawa]]n police spokesman: \"Victimized women feel too ashamed to make it public\".<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nIn his book \"Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb\", George Feifer noted that by 1946 there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of rape in Okinawa. He explains that it was: \"partly because of shame and disgrace, partly because Americans were victors and occupiers\". Feifer claimed: \"In all there were probably thousands of incidents, but the victims' silence kept rape another dirty secret of the campaign.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Feifer |first=George |date=1992 |title=Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb |location=Michigan |publisher=Ticknor & Fields |isbn=9780395599242 |url=https://archive.org/details/tennozanbattleof00feif }}</ref> Many people wondered why it never came to light after the inevitable American-Japanese babies the many women must have had. In interviews, historians and Okinawan elders said that some Okinawan women who were raped did give birth to biracial children, but that many of them were immediately killed or left behind out of shame, disgust or fearful trauma. More often, however, rape victims underwent crude abortions with the help of village midwives.<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nHowever, American professor of Japanese Studies Michael S.

Many men, some the very young and old, were killed resisting or trying to escape. Once collected, they would be roped or chained together and marched, with little food or water, long distances to camp. They often died or were killed along the way, sometimes less than 50 percent reaching camp alive. Then recruit camp was no better, with hospitals resembling Nazi concentration camps...

That same year, efforts were taken by Allied high commanders to suppress \"take no prisoners\" attitudes,<ref name=Ferguson2004/> among their own personnel (as these were affecting intelligence gathering) and to encourage Japanese soldiers to surrender. Ferguson adds that measures by Allied commanders to improve the ratio of Japanese prisoners to Japanese dead, resulted in it reaching 1:7, by mid-1945. Nevertheless, taking no prisoners was still standard practice among US troops at the [[Battle of Okinawa]], in April\u2013June 1945.<ref name=Ferguson2004/>\n\n[[Ulrich A.

At the time, there were only women, children and old people in the village, as all the young men had been mobilized for the war. Soon after landing, the Marines \"mopped up\" the entire village, but found no signs of Japanese forces. Taking advantage of the situation, they started \"hunting for women\" in broad daylight and those who were hiding in the village or nearby air raid shelters were dragged out one after another.<ref>Tanaka, Toshiyuki.

The article goes deeper into the matter and claims that the villagers' tale - true or not - is part of a 'dark, long-kept secret' the unraveling of which 'refocused attention on what historians say is one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war': \"the widespread rape of Okinawan women by American servicemen\".<ref>{{Cite news|last = Sims |first = Calvin |date = 1 June 2000 |title = 3 Dead Marines and a Secret of Wartime Okinawa |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/01/world/3-dead-marines-and-a-secret-of-wartime-okinawa.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=Nago, Japan |access-date=6 April 2015 |quote= Still, the villagers' tale of a dark, long-kept secret has refocused attention on what historians say is one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war, the widespread rape of Okinawan women by American servicemen.}}</ref> Although Japanese reports of rape were largely ignored at the time, academic estimates have been that as many as 10,000 Okinawan women may have been raped. It has been claimed that the rape was so prevalent that most Okinawans over age 65 around the year 2000 either knew or had heard of a woman who was raped in the aftermath of the war. Military officials denied the mass rapings, and all surviving veterans refused ''The New York Times''' request for an interview.<ref name=\"okinawa\">{{Cite news|last = Sims |first = Calvin |date = 1 June 2000 |title = 3 Dead Marines and a Secret of Wartime Okinawa |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/01/world/3-dead-marines-and-a-secret-of-wartime-okinawa.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=Nago, Japan |access-date=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nProfessor of East Asian Studies and expert on Okinawa Steve Rabson said: \"I have read many accounts of such rapes in Okinawan newspapers and books, but few people know about them or are willing to talk about them\". Books, diaries, articles and other documents refer to rapes by American soldiers of various races and backgrounds. Samuel Saxton, a retired captain, explained that the American veterans and witnesses may have believed: \"It would be unfair for the public to get the impression that we were all a bunch of rapists after we worked so hard to serve our country\". Masaie Ishihara, a sociology professor, supports this: \"There is a lot of historical amnesia out there, many people don't want to acknowledge what really happened\".<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nAn explanation given for why the US military has no record of any rapes is that few - if any - Okinawan women reported abuse, mostly out of fear and embarrassment. Those who did report them are believed by historians to have been ignored by the US military police. A large scale effort to determine the extent of such crimes has also never been called for. Over five decades after the war has ended the women who were believed to have been raped still refused to give a public statement, with friends, local historians and university professors who had spoken with the women instead saying they preferred not to discuss it publicly. According to a [[Nago, Okinawa]]n police spokesman: \"Victimized women feel too ashamed to make it public\".<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nIn his book \"Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb\", George Feifer noted that by 1946 there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of rape in Okinawa. He explains that it was: \"partly because of shame and disgrace, partly because Americans were victors and occupiers\". Feifer claimed: \"In all there were probably thousands of incidents, but the victims' silence kept rape another dirty secret of the campaign.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Feifer |first=George |date=1992 |title=Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb |location=Michigan |publisher=Ticknor & Fields |isbn=9780395599242 |url=https://archive.org/details/tennozanbattleof00feif }}</ref> Many people wondered why it never came to light after the inevitable American-Japanese babies the many women must have had. In interviews, historians and Okinawan elders said that some Okinawan women who were raped did give birth to biracial children, but that many of them were immediately killed or left behind out of shame, disgust or fearful trauma. More often, however, rape victims underwent crude abortions with the help of village midwives.<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nHowever, American professor of Japanese Studies Michael S.
