They have competed in the [[Nigeria Women Premier League]], the highest division for women association football in the country, since the 2018/2019 season, having gained promotion to the elite league by winning all their lower division's matches.\n\nKnown as Dream Stars Ladies, until April 2020, the DreamStar FC Ladies had the distinction of being the only club-side with clean sheet in the 2nd Division Pro league 2017/2018 season in both Northern and Southern Conferences. DreamStar FC Ladies is the female, and most distinguished professional, squad of [[Dream Stars Sports Development Organisation]], a grassroots soccer development company that provides a total value-chain development programme through its football academy for boys and girls to the professional stage. The [[Dream Stars Sports Development Organisation]], its academy, and clubs were created on the 29th of February 2012 by founder and chairman, [[AbdulRahmon Abolore]].\n\n==History==\nDreamStar FC Ladies played in the Southern Conference of the lower division of [[NWFL]] in the 2017/2018 season, and topped the division, without losing a match. This earned them promotion to the Premier Division of the [[NWFL]] for the 2018/2019 season.\n\nThe first season in the premiership league was not without its challenges, and despite recording some memorable feats such as scoring the most goals for any debutante side (4-0 against [[Heartland Queens]]) in the [[NWPL]] history (2nd highest for any club to [[Bayelsa Queens]]' 5 \u2013 1 trouncing of [[Kaduna Queens]]), and winning the [[NWFL]] Goal of the Season Award 2018/2019, scored by defender, [[Bunmi Oladeji]], DreamStar FC Ladies finished at the bottom of the table in their group. To retain their place in the premier league, DreamStar FC Ladies had to engage in play-offs against three other relegation bound clubs from the other three groups. The debutantes (known then as Dream Stars Ladies) edged [[Invincible Angels]] 4-2 on penalties after they played out a 1-1 draw in regulation time at the Fifa Goal Project pitch, MKO Stadium, to avoid relegation. The team secured a lead in the 21st minute of the play-off, as [[Anuoluwapo Salisu]]\u2019s corner kick found captain [[Judith Nwaogu]], whose header beat the [[Heartland Queen]]'s goalkeeper. However, the [[Benue State]] based side fought back in the second half and levelled matters in the 84th minute through Kafayat Bashiru before full-time, but eventually bowed out in the ensuing penalty kicks.\n\n==2019/2020 Season==\nIn the 2019/2020 the [[NWPL]] changes its 4-group format to 2 groups, to enable higher quality of competition. DreamStar FC Ladies has been drawn into Group A, along with [[Pelican Stars FC]], [[Nasarawa Amazons FC]], [[Sunshine Stars FC]], [[Bayelsa Queens FC]], [[Abia Angels FC]], [[Confluence Queens FC]], and [[Edo Queens FC]]. The top two teams from each group will qualify automatically for the [[Nigeria Women's Super Cup]] (also known as The Super 4 Championship), while the last teams from the two groups will get relegated to the [[NWFL]] - 2nd Division Pro League.\n\n===Present Squad===\nThe 2019-2020 team list as released by the club's management:\n\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1 |nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Alice Zwalbong Poney]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=3 |nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Aishat Animashaun]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=4 |nat=NGA|pos=MF|name=[[Esther Kareem]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=6 |nat=NGA|pos=MF|name=[[Rahmat Damilola Omotosho]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=7 |nat=NGA|pos=FW|name=[[Ngozi Blessing Ukwuoma]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=8 |nat=NGA|pos=MF|name=[[Olamide Adugbe]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=9|nat=NGA|pos=MF|name=[[Rachael Omolola]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=NGA|pos=MF|name=[[Grace Anuoluwapo Salisu]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=NGA|pos=MF|name=[[Tosin Ogundeko]]\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=NGA|pos=MF|name=[[Nenrot Galadima Kitka]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=NGA|pos=FW|name=[[Bukola Owoseni]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Oluwabunmi Oladeji]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Naomi Omotine Afemikhe]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=NGA|pos=MF|name=[[Abosede Hawa]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=NGA|pos=MF|name=[[Elizabeth Zirike]]}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Hope Olehi]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=NGA|pos=GK|name=[[Faith Omilana]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=NGA|pos=MF|name=[[Sofiat Bankole]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Desire Iberaan Orlu]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Lola Agnes Ajibade]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Dorcas Effiong]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Judith Ada Osuagwu]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=28|nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Judith Odinaka Nwaogu]]}}|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=29|nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Rosemary Ochulor]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=30|nat=NGA|pos=FW|name=[[Gift Emmanuel]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=31|nat=NGA|pos=GK|name=[[Onyekachi Egobirioku Eze]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=32|nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Rukewe Lucky]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=33|nat=NGA|pos=GK|name=[[Shukurat Ayomide Bakare]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=37|nat=NGA|pos=MF|name=[[Celestina Adaobi Ogunwa]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=40|nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Precious Obasi]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n==Business Development==\nDreamStar FC Ladies and their owner, [[Dream Stars Sports Development Organisation]], are not without the usual problem that assails privately owned soccer clubs in Africa - inadequate funding.

{"title_page": "Caribbean literature", "text_new": "{{short description|Literature of the Caribbean region}}\n'''Caribbean literature''' is the term generally accepted for the [[literature]] of the various territories of the [[Caribbean]] region. Literature in English specifically from the former [[British West Indies]] may be referred to as '''Anglo-Caribbean''' or, in historical contexts, '''West Indian''' literature, although in modern contexts the latter term is rare.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nMost of these territories have become independent nations since the 1960s, though some retain colonial ties to the [[United Kingdom]]. They all share, apart from the [[English language]], a number of political, cultural, and social ties which make it useful to consider their literary output in a single category. The more wide-ranging term \"Caribbean literature\" generally refers to the literature of all Caribbean territories regardless of language\u2014whether written in English, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Caribbean Hindustani|Hindustani]], or [[Dutch language|Dutch]], or one of numerous [[creole languages|creoles]].<ref>Dash, J. Michael. ''The Other America: Caribbean Literature in a New World Context.'' Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1998.</ref>\n\n==\"Caribbean literature\" vs \"West Indian literature\"==\nAs scholarship expands, there is debate about the correct term to use for literature that comes from the region. Both terms are often used interchangeably despite having different origins and referring to slightly different groups of people. Since so much of Caribbean identity is linked to \"insidious racism\" and \"the justification of slave labor\", it is usual to refer to the author of the piece for their identity preference.<ref>Safa, Helen I. \"POPULAR CULTURE, NATIONAL IDENTITY, AND RACE IN THE CARIBBEAN.\" Nieuwe West-Indische Gids / New West Indian Guide, vol. 61, no. 3/4, 1 Jan. 1987, pp. 115\u2013126.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/41849291 </ref>\n\nWest Indian is defined as coming from the \"West Indies\", which includes \"the islands of the Caribbean\" and was \"used first [for] indigenous population, and subsequently both [for] settlers of European origin and of people of African origin brought to the area as slaves.\" West Indian can also refer to things that can be \"traced back\" to the West Indies but the creators \"live elsewhere\".<ref>\"West Indian.\" Oxford English Dictionary, 2018, Oxford University Press. </ref> West Indian \"was a term coined by colonising European powers.\"<ref>Begg, Yusuf. \"Cocktail Conversations: West Indian Vs Caribbean.\" The Economic Times, Economic Times, 13 Nov. 2011, economictimes.indiatimes.com/cocktail-conversations-west-indian-vs-caribbean/articleshow/10707160.cms.</ref> Caribbean, on the other hand, is defined as \"of the Caribbean...its people, and their cultures\" only.<ref>\"Caribbean.\" Oxford English Dictionary, 2018, Oxford University Press. </ref>\n\nFurther issues include language classifications like Creole Caribbean literature and Anglophone Caribbean literature. Different languages also make different references to the texts. While there is no terminology that is obsolete, the issue requires acknowledgement due to it being literature of historically oppressed people.<ref>Safa, Helen I. \"POPULAR CULTURE, NATIONAL IDENTITY, AND RACE IN THE CARIBBEAN.\" Nieuwe West-Indische Gids / New West Indian Guide, vol. 61, no. 3/4, 1 Jan. 1987, pp. 115\u2013126.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/41849291 </ref>\n\n==Territories included in the category \"West Indian\"==\nThe literature of [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Aruba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], the [[British Virgin Islands]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saint Martin]], [[St Kitts and Nevis]], [[St Lucia]], [[St Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Suriname]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Turks and Caicos]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] would normally be considered to belong to the wider category of West Indian literature. Some literary scholars might also include [[Bermuda]], though geographically Bermuda is not part of the Caribbean and cultural ties with the region are not very strong.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n==Development of the idea of West Indian literature==\nThe term \"West Indies\" first began to achieve wide currency in the 1950s, when writers such as [[Samuel Selvon]], [[John Edgar Colwell Hearne|John Hearne]], [[Edgar Mittelholzer]], [[V. S. Naipaul]], and [[George Lamming]] began to be published in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>[[Kenneth Ramchand|Ramchand, Kenneth]]. ''The West Indian Novel and Its Background.'' London: Faber, 1970.</ref> A sense of a single literature developing across the islands was also encouraged in the 1940s by the [[BBC]] radio programme ''[[Caribbean Voices]]'', which featured stories and poems written by West Indian authors, recorded in London under the direction of founding producer [[Una Marson]] and later [[Henry Swanzy]], and broadcast back to the islands.<ref>Griffith, Glyne. \"Deconstructing Nationalisms: Henry Swanzy, Caribbean Voices and the Development of West Indian Literature\", ''[[Small Axe: A Caribbean Journal of Criticism|Small Axe]]'', Number 10 (Volume 5, Number 2), September 2001, pp. 1\u201320.</ref> Magazines such as ''[[Kyk-Over-Al (magazine)|Kyk-Over-Al]]'' in Guyana, ''[[Bim (magazine)|Bim]]'' in Barbados, and ''[[Focus (Jamaican magazine)|Focus]]'' in Jamaica, which published work by writers from across the region, also encouraged links and helped build an audience.<ref>Dalleo, Raphael. ''[http://caribbeanpublicsphere.blogs.bucknell.edu/ Caribbean Literature and the Public Sphere: From the Plantation to the Postcolonial.]'' Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012.</ref>\n\nMany\u2014perhaps most\u2014West Indian writers have found it necessary to leave their home territories and base themselves in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]] in order to make a living from their work\u2014in some cases spending the greater parts of their careers away from the territories of their birth. Critics in their adopted territories might argue that, for instance, [[V. S. Naipaul]] ought to be considered a British writer instead of a Trinidadian writer, or [[Jamaica Kincaid]] and [[Paule Marshall]] American writers, but most West Indian readers and critics still consider these writers \"West Indian\".\n\nWest Indian literature ranges over subjects and themes as wide as those of any other \"national\" literature, but in general many West Indian writers share a special concern with questions of identity, ethnicity, and language that rise out of the Caribbean historical experience.\n\n[[File:Marlon James BBF 2010 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Marlon James at the 2010 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]]]]\nOne unique and pervasive characteristic of Caribbean literature is the use of \"[[dialect]]\" forms of the national language, often termed [[Creole language|creole]]. The various local variations in the language adopted from the [[colonial powers]] such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]], have been modified over the years within each country and each has developed a blend that is unique to their country. Many Caribbean authors in their writing switch liberally between the local variation\u2014now commonly termed [[nation language]]\u2014and the standard form of the language.<ref>{{cite web|last=Waters|first=Erika J.|authorlink=Erika J. Waters|title=Paradise Revealed: Readings in Caribbean Literature|url=http://www.mainehumanities.org|publisher=Maine Humanities Council|accessdate=25 April 2012|year=2009}}</ref>\nTwo West Indian writers have won the [[Nobel Prize for literature|Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[Derek Walcott]] (1992), born in St. Lucia, resident mostly in Trinidad during the 1960s and '70s, and partly in the United States since then; and [[V. S. Naipaul]], born in Trinidad and resident in the [[United Kingdom]] since 1950. ([[Saint-John Perse]], who won the Nobel Prize in 1960, was born in the French territory of [[Guadeloupe]].)\n\nOther notable names in (anglophone) Caribbean literature have included [[Una Marson]], [[Earl Lovelace]], [[Austin Clarke (novelist)|Austin Clarke]], [[Claude McKay]], [[Louise Bennett]], [[Orlando Patterson]], [[Andrew Salkey]], [[Edward Kamau Brathwaite]] (who was born in Barbados and has lived in Ghana and Jamaica), [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]], [[Velma Pollard]] and [[Michelle Cliff]], to name only a few. In more recent times, a number of literary voices have emerged from the Caribbean as well as the Caribbean diaspora, including Kittitian [[Caryl Phillips]] (who has lived in the UK since one month of age); [[Edwidge Danticat]], a [[Haiti]]an immigrant to the United States; [[Anthony Kellman]] from Barbados, who divides his time between Barbados and the United States; [[Andrea Levy]] of the United Kingdom; Jamaicans [[Alecia McKenzie]], who has lived in Belgium, Singapore and France, and [[Colin Channer]] and [[Marlon James (novelist)|Marlon James]], the author of the [[Man Booker Prize]]-winning novel ''[[A Brief History of Seven Killings]]'' (2014) (as well as ''John Crow's Devil'', ''[[The Book of Night Women]]'', the unpublished screenplay \"Dead Men\", and the short story \"Under Cover of Darkness\"), Antiguan [[Marie-Elena John]], and [[Lasana M. Sekou]] from St. Maarten/St. Martin.\n\n==Influences on West Indian literature==\n[[Indian indenture system|Indentureship]] and migration were key factors in shaping Caribbean literature. The migration of Caribbean workers towards the [[Panama Canal]] is often used as a foundation by many authors. For example, [[Maryse Cond\u00e9]]\u2019s novel ''[[Tree of Life (novel)|Tree of Life]]'' (1992) discusses the involvement of family ties and working life within the Panama Canal. The idea of influence is further exemplified in [[Ramabai Espinet]]\u2019s novel ''[[The Swinging Bridge]]'', which explores the idea of Indian indentureship and the direct silencing of women.\n\nThe number of influences are not limited to those stated above, rather, the works within this canon often stem from [[History of the Caribbean|independence]], [[gender role]]s, and [[literary movements]].\n\nThere have been a number of collected works that focus on women's roles in the Caribbean. A dissertation entitled ''Mair''discusses the lives of women in Jamaica. A lot of similar work focuses on women and typically treat sexuality as heteronormative. In this specific style of work, analytical approaches to queer theory have not yet appeared or been explored.\n\nIncluded in the topic of how colonialism effected Caribbean literature is how writers use agricultural symbolism in to represent the need or desire to escape colonial rule. The connection between agriculture and the need to survive represents a closeness with the Earth itself. Native fruits and vegetables were used to speak around the colonized discourse; a way of speaking out in a sort of code. Derek Walcott is an author who utilizes this type of speak in his poetry.\n\n==Literary festivals==\nMany parts of the Caribbean have begun in recent years to host literary festivals, including in Anguilla, the Anguilla Lit Fest, in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] the [[NGC Bocas Lit Fest]],<ref name=\"bocaslitfest\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bocaslitfest.com/ |title=The Trinidad and Tobago Bocas Literary Festival - Bocas Lit Fest |publisher=bocaslitfest.com|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> in [[Jamaica]] the [[Calabash International Literary Festival]],<ref name=\"calabashfestival\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calabashfestival.org/2014/index.html |title=Calabash 2014 |publisher=calabashfestival.org|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> in [[Saint Martin]]/[[Sint Maarten]] the St. Martin Book Fair,<ref name=\"St. Martin Book Fair\">{{cite web|url=http://houseofnehesipublish.com/sxm/st-martin-book-fair/ |title=The St. Martin Book Fair. |publisher=houseofnehesipublish.com|accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref> in [[Barbados]] Bim Literary Festival,<ref name=\"bimlitfest\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bimlitfest.org/ |title=Home &#124; BIM Bim Litfest. |publisher=bimlitfest.org|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> in [[Dominica]] the Nature Island Literary Festival and Book Fair,<ref name=\"dominicalitfest\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dominicalitfest.com/ |title=Nature Island Literary Festival and Book Fair &#124; Dominica, West Indies |publisher=dominicalitfest.com|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> Alliouagana Festival of the word<ref name=\"litfest\">{{cite web|url=http://litfest.ms/ |title= Alliouagana Festival of the Word |publisher=litfest.ms|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> in [[Montserrat]], and the Antigua and Barbuda Literary Festival.<ref name=\"facebook\">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/AntiguaLiteraryFestival |title=Antigua and Barbuda Literary Festival |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Prizes==\n* [[Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas Prize]]\n* [[OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature]]<ref>[http://www.bocaslitfest.com/awards/the-ocm-bocas-prize-for-caribbean-literature/ The OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630044650/http://www.bocaslitfest.com/awards/the-ocm-bocas-prize-for-caribbean-literature/ |date=2015-06-30 }}, NGC Bocas Lit Fest.</ref>\n* Grand Prize for Caribbean Literature, Association of Caribbean Writers (Guadeloupe)<ref>[http://ecrivainsdelacaraibe.com/en/association-of-caribbean-writers/literary-prize/ \"Literary Prize\"], Association of Caribbean Writers.</ref>\n\n==Notable West Indian writers==\n(Grouped by territory of birth or upbringing)\n\n===Antigua===\n*[[Marie-Elena John]]\n*[[Jamaica Kincaid]]\n*[[Joanne C.

They all share, apart from the [[English language]], a number of political, cultural, and social ties which make it useful to consider their literary output in a single category. The more wide-ranging term \"Caribbean literature\" generally refers to the literature of all Caribbean territories regardless of language\u2014whether written in English, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Caribbean Hindustani|Hindustani]], or [[Dutch language|Dutch]], or one of numerous [[creole languages|creoles]].<ref>Dash, J.

Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1998.</ref>\n\n==\"Caribbean literature\" vs \"West Indian literature\"==\nAs scholarship expands, there is debate about the correct term to use for literature that comes from the region. Both terms are often used interchangeably despite having different origins and referring to slightly different groups of people. Since so much of Caribbean identity is linked to \"insidious racism\" and \"the justification of slave labor\", it is usual to refer to the author of the piece for their identity preference.<ref>Safa, Helen I. \"POPULAR CULTURE, NATIONAL IDENTITY, AND RACE IN THE CARIBBEAN.\" Nieuwe West-Indische Gids / New West Indian Guide, vol. 61, no. 3/4, 1 Jan. 1987, pp. 115\u2013126.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/41849291 </ref>\n\nWest Indian is defined as coming from the \"West Indies\", which includes \"the islands of the Caribbean\" and was \"used first [for] indigenous population, and subsequently both [for] settlers of European origin and of people of African origin brought to the area as slaves.\" West Indian can also refer to things that can be \"traced back\" to the West Indies but the creators \"live elsewhere\".<ref>\"West Indian.\" Oxford English Dictionary, 2018, Oxford University Press. </ref> West Indian \"was a term coined by colonising European powers.\"<ref>Begg, Yusuf. \"Cocktail Conversations: West Indian Vs Caribbean.\" The Economic Times, Economic Times, 13 Nov. 2011, economictimes.indiatimes.com/cocktail-conversations-west-indian-vs-caribbean/articleshow/10707160.cms.</ref> Caribbean, on the other hand, is defined as \"of the Caribbean...its people, and their cultures\" only.<ref>\"Caribbean.\" Oxford English Dictionary, 2018, Oxford University Press. </ref>\n\nFurther issues include language classifications like Creole Caribbean literature and Anglophone Caribbean literature. Different languages also make different references to the texts.

Some literary scholars might also include [[Bermuda]], though geographically Bermuda is not part of the Caribbean and cultural ties with the region are not very strong.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n==Development of the idea of West Indian literature==\nThe term \"West Indies\" first began to achieve wide currency in the 1950s, when writers such as [[Samuel Selvon]], [[John Edgar Colwell Hearne|John Hearne]], [[Edgar Mittelholzer]], [[V. S. Naipaul]], and [[George Lamming]] began to be published in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>[[Kenneth Ramchand|Ramchand, Kenneth]]. ''The West Indian Novel and Its Background.'' London: Faber, 1970.</ref> A sense of a single literature developing across the islands was also encouraged in the 1940s by the [[BBC]] radio programme ''[[Caribbean Voices]]'', which featured stories and poems written by West Indian authors, recorded in London under the direction of founding producer [[Una Marson]] and later [[Henry Swanzy]], and broadcast back to the islands.<ref>Griffith, Glyne. \"Deconstructing Nationalisms: Henry Swanzy, Caribbean Voices and the Development of West Indian Literature\", ''[[Small Axe: A Caribbean Journal of Criticism|Small Axe]]'', Number 10 (Volume 5, Number 2), September 2001, pp. 1\u201320.</ref> Magazines such as ''[[Kyk-Over-Al (magazine)|Kyk-Over-Al]]'' in Guyana, ''[[Bim (magazine)|Bim]]'' in Barbados, and ''[[Focus (Jamaican magazine)|Focus]]'' in Jamaica, which published work by writers from across the region, also encouraged links and helped build an audience.<ref>Dalleo, Raphael. ''[http://caribbeanpublicsphere.blogs.bucknell.edu/ Caribbean Literature and the Public Sphere: From the Plantation to the Postcolonial.]'' Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012.</ref>\n\nMany\u2014perhaps most\u2014West Indian writers have found it necessary to leave their home territories and base themselves in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]] in order to make a living from their work\u2014in some cases spending the greater parts of their careers away from the territories of their birth. Critics in their adopted territories might argue that, for instance, [[V. S. Naipaul]] ought to be considered a British writer instead of a Trinidadian writer, or [[Jamaica Kincaid]] and [[Paule Marshall]] American writers, but most West Indian readers and critics still consider these writers \"West Indian\".\n\nWest Indian literature ranges over subjects and themes as wide as those of any other \"national\" literature, but in general many West Indian writers share a special concern with questions of identity, ethnicity, and language that rise out of the Caribbean historical experience.\n\n[[File:Marlon James BBF 2010 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Marlon James at the 2010 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]]]]\nOne unique and pervasive characteristic of Caribbean literature is the use of \"[[dialect]]\" forms of the national language, often termed [[Creole language|creole]]. The various local variations in the language adopted from the [[colonial powers]] such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]], have been modified over the years within each country and each has developed a blend that is unique to their country. Many Caribbean authors in their writing switch liberally between the local variation\u2014now commonly termed [[nation language]]\u2014and the standard form of the language.<ref>{{cite web|last=Waters|first=Erika J.|authorlink=Erika J.

S. Naipaul]], born in Trinidad and resident in the [[United Kingdom]] since 1950. ([[Saint-John Perse]], who won the Nobel Prize in 1960, was born in the French territory of [[Guadeloupe]].)\n\nOther notable names in (anglophone) Caribbean literature have included [[Una Marson]], [[Earl Lovelace]], [[Austin Clarke (novelist)|Austin Clarke]], [[Claude McKay]], [[Louise Bennett]], [[Orlando Patterson]], [[Andrew Salkey]], [[Edward Kamau Brathwaite]] (who was born in Barbados and has lived in Ghana and Jamaica), [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]], [[Velma Pollard]] and [[Michelle Cliff]], to name only a few. In more recent times, a number of literary voices have emerged from the Caribbean as well as the Caribbean diaspora, including Kittitian [[Caryl Phillips]] (who has lived in the UK since one month of age); [[Edwidge Danticat]], a [[Haiti]]an immigrant to the United States; [[Anthony Kellman]] from Barbados, who divides his time between Barbados and the United States; [[Andrea Levy]] of the United Kingdom; Jamaicans [[Alecia McKenzie]], who has lived in Belgium, Singapore and France, and [[Colin Channer]] and [[Marlon James (novelist)|Marlon James]], the author of the [[Man Booker Prize]]-winning novel ''[[A Brief History of Seven Killings]]'' (2014) (as well as ''John Crow's Devil'', ''[[The Book of Night Women]]'', the unpublished screenplay \"Dead Men\", and the short story \"Under Cover of Darkness\"), Antiguan [[Marie-Elena John]], and [[Lasana M. Sekou]] from St. Maarten/St. Martin.\n\n==Influences on West Indian literature==\n[[Indian indenture system|Indentureship]] and migration were key factors in shaping Caribbean literature. The migration of Caribbean workers towards the [[Panama Canal]] is often used as a foundation by many authors. For example, [[Maryse Cond\u00e9]]\u2019s novel ''[[Tree of Life (novel)|Tree of Life]]'' (1992) discusses the involvement of family ties and working life within the Panama Canal. The idea of influence is further exemplified in [[Ramabai Espinet]]\u2019s novel ''[[The Swinging Bridge]]'', which explores the idea of Indian indentureship and the direct silencing of women.\n\nThe number of influences are not limited to those stated above, rather, the works within this canon often stem from [[History of the Caribbean|independence]], [[gender role]]s, and [[literary movements]].\n\nThere have been a number of collected works that focus on women's roles in the Caribbean. A dissertation entitled ''Mair''discusses the lives of women in Jamaica. A lot of similar work focuses on women and typically treat sexuality as heteronormative. In this specific style of work, analytical approaches to queer theory have not yet appeared or been explored.\n\nIncluded in the topic of how colonialism effected Caribbean literature is how writers use agricultural symbolism in to represent the need or desire to escape colonial rule. The connection between agriculture and the need to survive represents a closeness with the Earth itself. Native fruits and vegetables were used to speak around the colonized discourse; a way of speaking out in a sort of code. Derek Walcott is an author who utilizes this type of speak in his poetry.\n\n==Literary festivals==\nMany parts of the Caribbean have begun in recent years to host literary festivals, including in Anguilla, the Anguilla Lit Fest, in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] the [[NGC Bocas Lit Fest]],<ref name=\"bocaslitfest\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bocaslitfest.com/ |title=The Trinidad and Tobago Bocas Literary Festival - Bocas Lit Fest |publisher=bocaslitfest.com|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> in [[Jamaica]] the [[Calabash International Literary Festival]],<ref name=\"calabashfestival\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calabashfestival.org/2014/index.html |title=Calabash 2014 |publisher=calabashfestival.org|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> in [[Saint Martin]]/[[Sint Maarten]] the St. Martin Book Fair,<ref name=\"St. Martin Book Fair\">{{cite web|url=http://houseofnehesipublish.com/sxm/st-martin-book-fair/ |title=The St. Martin Book Fair. |publisher=houseofnehesipublish.com|accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref> in [[Barbados]] Bim Literary Festival,<ref name=\"bimlitfest\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bimlitfest.org/ |title=Home &#124; BIM Bim Litfest. |publisher=bimlitfest.org|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> in [[Dominica]] the Nature Island Literary Festival and Book Fair,<ref name=\"dominicalitfest\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dominicalitfest.com/ |title=Nature Island Literary Festival and Book Fair &#124; Dominica, West Indies |publisher=dominicalitfest.com|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> Alliouagana Festival of the word<ref name=\"litfest\">{{cite web|url=http://litfest.ms/ |title= Alliouagana Festival of the Word |publisher=litfest.ms|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> in [[Montserrat]], and the Antigua and Barbuda Literary Festival.<ref name=\"facebook\">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/AntiguaLiteraryFestival |title=Antigua and Barbuda Literary Festival |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Prizes==\n* [[Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas Prize]]\n* [[OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature]]<ref>[http://www.bocaslitfest.com/awards/the-ocm-bocas-prize-for-caribbean-literature/ The OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630044650/http://www.bocaslitfest.com/awards/the-ocm-bocas-prize-for-caribbean-literature/ |date=2015-06-30 }}, NGC Bocas Lit Fest.</ref>\n* Grand Prize for Caribbean Literature, Association of Caribbean Writers (Guadeloupe)<ref>[http://ecrivainsdelacaraibe.com/en/association-of-caribbean-writers/literary-prize/ \"Literary Prize\"], Association of Caribbean Writers.</ref>\n\n==Notable West Indian writers==\n(Grouped by territory of birth or upbringing)\n\n===Antigua===\n*[[Marie-Elena John]]\n*[[Jamaica Kincaid]]\n*[[Joanne C.

The name referred to an eight-sided [[dice#Application in role-playing games|polyhedral die]] common in such games.\n\nUnlike other gaming magazines, ''d8''\u2019s focus was not on gaming systems and rules, but rather the art of role playing and the cultural, pop-cultural, and subcultural interests of the people who played games. ''d8'' styled itself \u201cthe magazine of role-playing culture\u201d. This editorial mission was conceived of by Founder and Creative Director David DeCheser. The magazine was financed by Frank Slattery IV, an avid gamer who wanted to be involved in the field.\n\n==Contributors==\nEdited by [[Holly Black]] and Joe Cirillo, the magazine had a host of eclectic and regular contributors that included author [[Steve Berman]], [[GWAR]] member [[Techno Destructo|Hunter Jackson]], illustrators Joseph Hasenauer and Theo Black, ''[[Yamara]]'' creators Barbara Manui and Chris Adams, and former ''[[Shadis]]'' editor Jolly R. Blackburn.\n\nArticles on [[LARP]]s were placed side-by-side with interviews with [[comic book]] artists such as [[Dave McKean]], reviews of authentic [[medieval]] restaurants, and [[caffeinated]] tips on how to game all night. One of ''d8''\u2019s stand-out regular features was its fashion spread which, coordinated by stylist Deanna Stull and photographed by Director of Photography Michael Amper, showcased shoots that included [[renaissance]] garb, neo-gothic vampires in latex, and leather plated armor.\n\nThe magazine is credited as introducing Holly Black to artist [[Tony DiTerlizzi]],<ref>\n{{cite web|url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-11-08-spiderwick_x.htm|title = 'Spiderwick' wraps the scary in a 'cozy' package|publisher = USA Today|author = Jacqueline Blais|accessdate = 2008-11-18|date = 2004-11-08}}</ref> who would later go on to co-author ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles]]''.

The name referred to an eight-sided [[dice#Application in role-playing games|polyhedral die]] common in such games.\n\nUnlike other gaming magazines, ''d8''\u2019s focus was not on gaming systems and rules, but rather the art of role playing and the cultural, pop-cultural, and subcultural interests of the people who played games. ''d8'' styled itself \u201cthe magazine of role-playing culture\u201d. This editorial mission was conceived of by Founder and Creative Director David DeCheser. The magazine was financed by Frank Slattery IV, an avid gamer who wanted to be involved in the field.\n\n==Contributors==\nEdited by [[Holly Black]] and Joe Cirillo, the magazine had a host of eclectic and regular contributors that included author [[Steve Berman]], [[GWAR]] member [[Techno Destructo|Hunter Jackson]], illustrators Joseph Hasenauer and Theo Black, ''[[Yamara]]'' creators Barbara Manui and Chris Adams, and former ''[[Shadis]]'' editor Jolly R. Blackburn.\n\nArticles on [[LARP]]s were placed side-by-side with interviews with [[comic book]] artists such as [[Dave McKean]], reviews of authentic [[medieval]] restaurants, and [[caffeinated]] tips on how to game all night. One of ''d8''\u2019s stand-out regular features was its fashion spread which, coordinated by stylist Deanna Stull and photographed by Director of Photography Michael Amper, showcased shoots that included [[renaissance]] garb, neo-gothic vampires in latex, and leather plated armor.\n\nThe magazine is credited as introducing Holly Black to artist [[Tony DiTerlizzi]],<ref>\n{{cite web|url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-11-08-spiderwick_x.htm|title = 'Spiderwick' wraps the scary in a 'cozy' package|publisher = USA Today|author = Jacqueline Blais|accessdate = 2008-11-18|date = 2004-11-08}}</ref> who would later go on to co-author ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles]]''.

The label was dormant in the mid-1990s while the [[Cowboy Junkies]] were signed to an American record label, but began to release independently produced albums in the 2000s. By the late 2000s, the label had a website selling downloads and CDs of its artists music catalogs.\n\n== History ==\nThe label was formed in [[London]] by Michael Timmins, Alan Anton, Geoff Railton, and [[Brett Wickens]] to produce and distribute their music.  After their first three releases, they returned to Canada, where Timmins and Anton formed [[Cowboy Junkies]] with Timmins' siblings [[Margo Timmins|Margo]] and Peter.\n\nIn Toronto, the label distributed Cowboy Junkies' first two albums before the band signed with [[RCA Records|RCA]], which re-released ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' internationally. For the next few years the label's releases were sporadic offerings produced by Michael Timmins and/or [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]].\n\nAfter Cowboy Junkies was released from their record contract\u2014by then with [[Geffen Records]]\u2014 following their 1998 album ''[[Miles from Our Home]]'', they revived Latent Recordings and have released their subsequent albums on that label in Canada.  The records have been licensed to other independent labels, such as [[Zo\u00eb Records]] in the [[United States]] and [[Strange Fruit Records]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], for international release.\n\nIn recent years, the label has again become active in releasing work by other artists as well, including Ivy Mairi, [[Skydiggers|Finlayson/Maize]], [[Jerry Leger]], [[Lee Harvey Osmond]] and [[Huron (Canadian band)|Huron]].\n\n==Catalogue==\nMost of Latent Recordings releases have been numbered, with the number preceded by \"LATEX\" (#s 1\u20135, V14), or \"LATEX CD\" (#s >5).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rateyourmusic.com/label/latent_recordings/ |title=Latent Recordings |website=Rate Your Music |accessdate=May 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://musicbrainz.org/label/e47933b9-766d-4be2-8f96-8df726531013 |title=Latent Recordings |website=MusicBrainz |accessdate=May 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/label/118582-Latent-Recordings |title=Latent Recordings |website=Discogs |accessdate=May 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! # !!

Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior. \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2016.\n\nIt charted for the first time on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 15 January 2016 at number 49 following Bowie's death.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Changes\" was written by Bowie in the summer of 1971 and recorded around the same time at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013225}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with pianist [[Rick Wakeman]] and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Wakeman was asked to play during the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' sessions and accepted.

He writes that these lines elucidate the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} They highlight the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Bowie's future persona Ziggy Stardust. Buckley states: \"Bowie plays up the self-made myth of his butterfly nature, his innate ambivalence, and his endless musical, sexual and political vacillation.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually.

[[David Bowie]], originally released on the album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' in December 1971 and as a single on 7 January 1972, the day before Bowie's 25th birthday. Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior. \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2016.\n\nIt charted for the first time on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 15 January 2016 at number 49 following Bowie's death.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Changes\" was written by Bowie in the summer of 1971 and recorded around the same time at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013225}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with pianist [[Rick Wakeman]] and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Wakeman was asked to play during the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' sessions and accepted. He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} This unreleased demo,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} featuring Bowie solely on piano, exhibits more \"enthusiasm\" than \"accuracy\" from the artist, along with containing \"breathy 'huh's'\" to a slightly different lyric: \"now I place myself to face me...the weeks still seem the same\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie plays a [[saxophone]] solo on the final recording \u2013 one of his earliest \u2013 which he recollected was recorded \"when I was still going through ideas of using melodic saxophone.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}}\n\nBowie has said that the track \"started out as a parody of a [[nightclub]] song, a kind of throwaway\".<ref name=\"Raggett AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Raggett |first1=Ned |title=\"Changes\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704103816/https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Loder, Kurt Loder; Bowie, David (1989). ''[[Sound + Vision (box set)|Sound + Vision]]'': CD liner notes</ref> The song's famous chorus, Bowie stuttering the 'ch' at the beginning of the word 'changes',{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} has been compared to the English rock band [[the Who]],<ref>Blake, Mark (ed.) (2007). \"Future Legend\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.74\u201375</ref> specifically their 1965 song \"[[My Generation]]\" (\"hope I die before I get old\" reads \"pretty soon now you're gonna get older\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg also believes there's a sense of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" in the lyrics \"time may change me, but I can't trace time\", in that Bowie is speaking up for his own generation against his elders.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie had previously spoken about this in an interview with ''The Times'' in 1968: \"We feel our parents' generation has lost control, given up, they\u2019re scared of the future. \"I feel it's basically their fault that things are so bad.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} While biographer Andy Buckley calls album track \"Life on Mars?\" a parody of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[My Way]]\", he calls \"Changes\" an inversion of it, stating, \"[it's] not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello\" in the line \"turn and face the strange\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=David_Bowie_-_Changes.ogg\n|title=David Bowie \"Changes\" (1971)\n|description=21 second sample from David Bowie's \"Changes\".\n|pos=left}}\n\nThe lyrics focus on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me / Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\").{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=98\u201399}} Buckley writes that 'strange fascination' is a phrase that \"not only embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre, but also carries with it the force of compulsion, the notion of having to change to afloat artistically.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Buckley further analysed the lyrics: \"So I turn myself to face me / But I've never caught a glimpse / Of how the others must see the faker / I'm much too fast to take that test\". He writes that these lines elucidate the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} They highlight the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Bowie's future persona Ziggy Stardust. Buckley states: \"Bowie plays up the self-made myth of his butterfly nature, his innate ambivalence, and his endless musical, sexual and political vacillation.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually. He gave himself the epithet 'faker' and proclaimed himself as \"pop's fraud; the arch-dissembler.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}\n\nThe song has also been interpreted as touting \"Modern Kids as a New Race\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} a theme echoed on the following album track, \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\". ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s contemporary review of ''Hunky Dory'' considered that \"Changes\" could be \"construed as a young man's attempt to reckon how he'll react when it's his time to be on the maligned side of the generation schism\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone review\">{{cite web |first=John |last=Mendelsohn |title=Hunky Dory |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=6 January 1972 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |access-date=2 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110180003/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |archive-date=10 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Changes\" was released on 17 December 1971 as the opening track on Bowie's fourth studio album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Hunky Dory|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1971|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8244}}</ref> It was subsequently released as the first single of the album (and the label itself{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}}) on 7 January 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2160) with fellow album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"Single liner notes\" /> This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior.<ref name=MEMag>\"Watch that Man\" by Tina Clarke, Music Express magazine, March 1990, page 9</ref> Upon release, like the album, it flopped commercially, peaking at number 66 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts and failing to chart in the UK.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Despite this, it became English disc jockey [[Tony Blackburn]]'s record of the week.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} It wasn't until the success of Bowie's following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972) that recognition was brought upon ''Hunky Dory'' and \"Changes\", which according to Pegg quickly became a \"turntable favorite\" and \"embedded\" itself into the \"pop-culture psyche\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} Commentators have later argued that \"[[Oh!

Produced by [[Westland Helicopters]], it came from the same [[Saro P.531|P.531]] programme as the [[British Army]] [[Westland Scout]], and was based on the earlier piston-engined [[Saunders-Roe Skeeter]]. It fulfilled the requirement of the [[Royal Navy]] for a helicopter small enough to land on the deck of a [[frigate]] and carry a useful load of two homing torpedoes.\n\nThe Wasp sunk one ship in combat, seriously damaging the [[ARA Santa Fe (S-21)|ARA Santa Fe]] submarine in 1982 during the Falklands war.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe increasing speed and attack range of the [[submarine]] threat, and the increased range at which this threat could be detected led to a Royal Navy requirement for a \"Manned Torpedo-Carrying Helicopter\" (MATCH). Contemporary shipboard weapons did not have the necessary range, therefore MATCH was in essence a stand-off weapon with the helicopter carrying the torpedo or other weapon to the target and being instructed when and where to drop it.<ref>Friedman 2006, pp. 245\u2013246.</ref> Unlike the larger [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]], the Wasp carried no sonar of its own, and was limited strictly to working in partnership with its parent ship, other ships or other ASW units.<ref name=\"James p347,72\">James 1991, pp. 347, 372.</ref>\n\n[[File:Westland Wasp 62.jpg|thumb|left|First Wasp at the SBAC show 1962, a month before the first flight]]\nThe first prototype Saro P.531 flew on 20 July 1958,<ref name=\"James p365\">James 1991, p.365.</ref> with the prototypes being subject to detailed testing by the Royal Navy, including the evaluation of several different undercarriage layouts, before settling on the definitive arrangement. An order for a pre-production batch of two \"Sea Scouts\" was placed in September 1961.  The first flight of the two pre-production Wasp took place on 28 October 1962.<ref name=\"James p371-2\">James 1991, pp.371\u2013372.</ref>  Full production soon commenced, 98 in total being procured for the RN. The Wasp successfully exported to [[Brazil]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South African Air Force|South Africa]]. 133 aircraft were built in total.<ref name=\"World Military p439\">Donald and Lake 1996, p.439.</ref>\n\nWasp was essentially a [[navalised]] Scout, indeed it was originally to be called the ''Sea Scout'', and differed mainly in design details. It had a unique 4-wheeled [[caster]]ing undercarriage that allowed the aircraft to be manoeuvred on small, pitching flightdecks. The Wasp had the ability of \"negative pitch\" from the rotor-blades which enabled the aircraft to \"adhere\" to the deck until the lashings were attached. Additional fuel tankage was installed in the cabin floor and both the tail boom and main rotor blades were foldable to allow stowage in the small hangars fitted to the first generation helicopter-carrying escorts. It was fitted with a winch above the starboard rear door, and also had the capacity to carry underslung loads from the semi automatic cargo release unit mounted under the fuselage. With a crew of 2 (Pilot and Missile Aimer/Aircrewman) and the capacity to seat 3 passengers Wasp was useful for short-range transport missions, and for casualty evacuation with room for one stretcher fitted across the rear cabin area.\n\nLater modifications included the ability to carry the Nord [[SS.11]] wire-guided missile, with the fitting of the Aimers sight in the left cockpit roof and the installation of large inflatable emergency floats in sponsons on either side of the cabin to prevent capsizing of the top-heavy aircraft in the event of [[ditching]].  The SS.11 had limited range to target small surface targets such as patrol boats or shore positions and this was later replaced by the [[AS.12]], which effectively had double the range.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Royal Navy===\n[[File:Galatea's personal arrive by helicopter (37651610341).jpg|thumb|Wasp from [[HMS Galatea (F18)|HMS ''Gatatea'']] landing personnel on [[Aldabra]] atoll, Indian Ocean (1970)]]\nThe Wasp HAS.1 was introduced to service in the small ships role in 1964, after an intensive period of trials by [[700 Naval Air Squadron|700(W) IFTU]] between June 1963 and March 1964. It served in this primary role with [[829 Naval Air Squadron]], but also in training units to supply crews for the front line with [[706 Naval Air Squadron|706 NAS]] between 1965 and 1967 and in [[703 Naval Air Squadron|703 NAS]] between 1972 and 1981. Single airframes also served for light liaison duties in the Commando Assault squadrons, [[845 Naval Air Squadron|845 NAS]] and [[848 Naval Air Squadron|848 NAS]] until 1973. Although effective as a submarine killer, it was best deployed paired with a [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]] HAS.3 submarine hunter. In the late 1970s, the [[Westland Lynx]] started to replace the Wasp.\n\nOn 25 April 1982 the Argentinian [[submarine]] {{ship|ARA|Santa Fe|S-21|6}} was spotted by a [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]] helicopter from {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}}. The Wessex and a [[Westland Lynx]] HAS.2 from {{HMS|Brilliant|F90|6}} then attacked it with [[depth charge]]s, a [[Mk 46 torpedo]], and also [[strafe]]d it with [[FN MAG|GPMG]]. A Wasp launched from {{HMS|Plymouth|F126|6}} and two Wasps launched from {{HMS|Endurance|1967|6}} fired [[Aerospatiale SS.12/AS.12|AS.12]] anti-ship missiles at the submarine, scoring hits. ''Santa Fe'' was damaged badly enough to prevent her from submerging. The crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty on [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] and surrendered to the British forces, thus becoming the first casualty of the sea war, as well as the first direct engagement by the Royal Navy Task Force.\n\nThe last Wasp was finally withdrawn from service in 1988 when the last of the Type 12 {{sclass-|Rothesay|frigate|0}} frigates was decommissioned.\n\n===Royal Malaysian Navy===\nThe Wasp came into service with the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] quite late, compared to the others nations who procured the aircraft. She joined the RMN on 8 April 1988. The Wasp had a relatively short career with that Navy, being phased out just ten years later when they were replaced by the [[Eurocopter Fennec]].\n\n===Royal New Zealand Navy===\nThe first four of an eventual nineteen Wasps were purchased by the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] in 1966, being immediately assigned to the new {{sclass-|Leander|frigate|0}} frigate, {{HMNZS|Waikato|F-55|6}}. They provided numerous tasks, as well as taking part in the [[Armilla Patrol]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the 1980s. The Wasps were flown by RNZN pilots but maintained by ground crews of [[No. 3 Squadron RNZAF]].\n\nIn 1997, four Wasps performed a [[flypast]], marking the arrival of the new {{sclass-|Anzac|frigate|0}} [[frigate]], [[HMNZS Te Kaha|HMNZS ''Te Kaha'']].\n\nThe Wasp served 32 years with the RNZN, retiring in 1998, the same year HMNZS ''Waikato'', which first operationally deployed the Wasp in New Zealand, was herself decommissioned. They were replaced by the [[SH-2 Seasprite]] as a stop gap until the Arrival of their SH-2G(NZ).\n\n===Royal Netherlands Navy===\n[[File:Westland Wasp HAS.1 AH-12A 244.K Portland 20.07.67 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|Wasp HAS.1 (AH-12A) of the Dutch Kon Marine, 1967]]\n\nWith the [[Dutch Naval Aviation|Royal Netherlands Navy]] beginning in the late 1960s, after the fire onboard {{HNLMS|Karel Doorman|R81|6}}, NATO anti-submarine commitments were taken over by a squadron of Westland Wasp helicopters, operated from six {{sclass-|Van Speijk|frigate|0}} anti-submarine frigates. The shore base was at [[De Kooy]]. The Royal Netherlands Navy 860 Naval Air Squadron received 12 Wasp helicopters between November 1966 and June 1967, operated from ''Van Speijk''-class frigates as AH-12As and flown in the ASW role. The last of the Dutch Wasps were eventually withdrawn from service in 1981 when they were replaced by the Westland Lynx.\n\n===Other operators===\nThe Wasp was also in service with the [[Brazilian Navy|Brazilian]], [[Indonesian Navy|Indonesian]], and [[South African Navy|South African]] navies. The Indonesian aircraft are all former Dutch aircraft and were the last of the type in active service.\n\nThe last of the ten surplus Dutch Navy helicopters refurbished by Westland's for the Indonesian Navy was grounded in 1998. Flown by 400 Squadron (RON 400) from NAS Juanda, and when at sea were embarked upon the Indonesian Navy's ex UK Royal Navy {{sclass2-|Tribal| frigate|0}} and ex-Dutch Navy {{sclass-|Van Speijk|frigate|2}}s.\n\nThe Brazilian Navy operated the Wasp as the UH-2 & UH-2A taking delivery of three new build helicopters in April 1966 and a further seven ex-Royal Navy helicopters in 1977. 1\u00ba ''Esquadr\u00e3o de Helic\u00f3pteros de Emprego Geral'' (HU-1) flew the helicopters from Navy's {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer|5}} and {{sclass-|Allen M. Sumner|destroyer|5}}-class destroyers and the {{sclass-|Niter\u00f3i|frigate|2}}s.\n\nThe South African Navy received their first batch of ten new build airframes in 1963, which was followed by the delivery of a second batch of further 8 from 1973. Although only six were delivered due to the International arms embargo placed on South Africa during the apartheid regime. The Wasps were flown by 22 Flight, from [[Ysterplaat]], the unit subsequently became 22 Squadron, Maritime Command in 1976. The helicopters were operated from the navy's {{sclass2-|President|frigate|0}} frigates. The South African Navy also acquired one ex Bahrain Public Security Force airframe as an instructional airframe to support its Wasp programme. The South African Navy withdrew their last Wasp in 1990.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Westland Wasp HAS1.png|thumb|right|Westland Wasp HAS.1]]\n\n;Sea Scout HAS.1\n:The Sea Scout HAS.1 was the original Royal Navy designation for the Wasp.\n;Wasp HAS.1\n:Shipboard anti-submarine warfare helicopter for the Royal Navy.\n\n==Operators==\n;{{BRA}}\n* [[Brazilian Navy]]<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.helis.com/database/modelorg/50/|title= For\u00e7a aeronaval da marinha|accessdate= 11 February 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121014133741/http://www.helis.com/database/modelorg/50/|archive-date= 14 October 2012|url-status= live}}</ref>\n;{{IDN}}\n* [[Indonesian Navy]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.helis.com/database/modelorg/52/ |title=tentara nasional indonesia angkatan laut -

Produced by [[Westland Helicopters]], it came from the same [[Saro P.531|P.531]] programme as the [[British Army]] [[Westland Scout]], and was based on the earlier piston-engined [[Saunders-Roe Skeeter]]. It fulfilled the requirement of the [[Royal Navy]] for a helicopter small enough to land on the deck of a [[frigate]] and carry a useful load of two homing torpedoes.\n\nThe Wasp sunk one ship in combat, seriously damaging the [[ARA Santa Fe (S-21)|ARA Santa Fe]] submarine in 1982 during the Falklands war.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe increasing speed and attack range of the [[submarine]] threat, and the increased range at which this threat could be detected led to a Royal Navy requirement for a \"Manned Torpedo-Carrying Helicopter\" (MATCH). Contemporary shipboard weapons did not have the necessary range, therefore MATCH was in essence a stand-off weapon with the helicopter carrying the torpedo or other weapon to the target and being instructed when and where to drop it.<ref>Friedman 2006, pp. 245\u2013246.</ref> Unlike the larger [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]], the Wasp carried no sonar of its own, and was limited strictly to working in partnership with its parent ship, other ships or other ASW units.<ref name=\"James p347,72\">James 1991, pp. 347, 372.</ref>\n\n[[File:Westland Wasp 62.jpg|thumb|left|First Wasp at the SBAC show 1962, a month before the first flight]]\nThe first prototype Saro P.531 flew on 20 July 1958,<ref name=\"James p365\">James 1991, p.365.</ref> with the prototypes being subject to detailed testing by the Royal Navy, including the evaluation of several different undercarriage layouts, before settling on the definitive arrangement. An order for a pre-production batch of two \"Sea Scouts\" was placed in September 1961.  The first flight of the two pre-production Wasp took place on 28 October 1962.<ref name=\"James p371-2\">James 1991, pp.371\u2013372.</ref>  Full production soon commenced, 98 in total being procured for the RN. The Wasp successfully exported to [[Brazil]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South African Air Force|South Africa]]. 133 aircraft were built in total.<ref name=\"World Military p439\">Donald and Lake 1996, p.439.</ref>\n\nWasp was essentially a [[navalised]] Scout, indeed it was originally to be called the ''Sea Scout'', and differed mainly in design details. It had a unique 4-wheeled [[caster]]ing undercarriage that allowed the aircraft to be manoeuvred on small, pitching flightdecks. The Wasp had the ability of \"negative pitch\" from the rotor-blades which enabled the aircraft to \"adhere\" to the deck until the lashings were attached. Additional fuel tankage was installed in the cabin floor and both the tail boom and main rotor blades were foldable to allow stowage in the small hangars fitted to the first generation helicopter-carrying escorts. It was fitted with a winch above the starboard rear door, and also had the capacity to carry underslung loads from the semi automatic cargo release unit mounted under the fuselage. With a crew of 2 (Pilot and Missile Aimer/Aircrewman) and the capacity to seat 3 passengers Wasp was useful for short-range transport missions, and for casualty evacuation with room for one stretcher fitted across the rear cabin area.\n\nLater modifications included the ability to carry the Nord [[SS.11]] wire-guided missile, with the fitting of the Aimers sight in the left cockpit roof and the installation of large inflatable emergency floats in sponsons on either side of the cabin to prevent capsizing of the top-heavy aircraft in the event of [[ditching]].  The SS.11 had limited range to target small surface targets such as patrol boats or shore positions and this was later replaced by the [[AS.12]], which effectively had double the range.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Royal Navy===\n[[File:Galatea's personal arrive by helicopter (37651610341).jpg|thumb|Wasp from [[HMS Galatea (F18)|HMS ''Gatatea'']] landing personnel on [[Aldabra]] atoll, Indian Ocean (1970)]]\nThe Wasp HAS.1 was introduced to service in the small ships role in 1964, after an intensive period of trials by [[700 Naval Air Squadron|700(W) IFTU]] between June 1963 and March 1964. It served in this primary role with [[829 Naval Air Squadron]], but also in training units to supply crews for the front line with [[706 Naval Air Squadron|706 NAS]] between 1965 and 1967 and in [[703 Naval Air Squadron|703 NAS]] between 1972 and 1981. Single airframes also served for light liaison duties in the Commando Assault squadrons, [[845 Naval Air Squadron|845 NAS]] and [[848 Naval Air Squadron|848 NAS]] until 1973. Although effective as a submarine killer, it was best deployed paired with a [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]] HAS.3 submarine hunter. In the late 1970s, the [[Westland Lynx]] started to replace the Wasp.\n\nOn 25 April 1982 the Argentinian [[submarine]] {{ship|ARA|Santa Fe|S-21|6}} was spotted by a [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]] helicopter from {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}}. The Wessex and a [[Westland Lynx]] HAS.2 from {{HMS|Brilliant|F90|6}} then attacked it with [[depth charge]]s, a [[Mk 46 torpedo]], and also [[strafe]]d it with [[FN MAG|GPMG]]. A Wasp launched from {{HMS|Plymouth|F126|6}} and two Wasps launched from {{HMS|Endurance|1967|6}} fired [[Aerospatiale SS.12/AS.12|AS.12]] anti-ship missiles at the submarine, scoring hits. ''Santa Fe'' was damaged badly enough to prevent her from submerging. The crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty on [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] and surrendered to the British forces, thus becoming the first casualty of the sea war, as well as the first direct engagement by the Royal Navy Task Force.\n\nThe last Wasp was finally withdrawn from service in 1988 when the last of the Type 12 {{sclass-|Rothesay|frigate|0}} frigates was decommissioned.\n\n===Royal Malaysian Navy===\nThe Wasp came into service with the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] quite late, compared to the others nations who procured the aircraft. She joined the RMN on 8 April 1988. The Wasp had a relatively short career with that Navy, being phased out just ten years later when they were replaced by the [[Eurocopter Fennec]].\n\n===Royal New Zealand Navy===\nThe first four of an eventual nineteen Wasps were purchased by the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] in 1966, being immediately assigned to the new {{sclass-|Leander|frigate|0}} frigate, {{HMNZS|Waikato|F-55|6}}. They provided numerous tasks, as well as taking part in the [[Armilla Patrol]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the 1980s. The Wasps were flown by RNZN pilots but maintained by ground crews of [[No. 3 Squadron RNZAF]].\n\nIn 1997, four Wasps performed a [[flypast]], marking the arrival of the new {{sclass-|Anzac|frigate|0}} [[frigate]], [[HMNZS Te Kaha|HMNZS ''Te Kaha'']].\n\nThe Wasp served 32 years with the RNZN, retiring in 1998, the same year HMNZS ''Waikato'', which first operationally deployed the Wasp in New Zealand, was herself decommissioned. They were replaced by the [[SH-2 Seasprite]] as a stop gap until the Arrival of their SH-2G(NZ).\n\n===Royal Netherlands Navy===\n[[File:Westland Wasp HAS.1 AH-12A 244.K Portland 20.07.67 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|Wasp HAS.1 (AH-12A) of the Dutch Kon Marine, 1967]]\n\nWith the [[Dutch Naval Aviation|Royal Netherlands Navy]] beginning in the late 1960s, after the fire onboard {{HNLMS|Karel Doorman|R81|6}}, NATO anti-submarine commitments were taken over by a squadron of Westland Wasp helicopters, operated from six {{sclass-|Van Speijk|frigate|0}} anti-submarine frigates. The shore base was at [[De Kooy]]. The Royal Netherlands Navy 860 Naval Air Squadron received 12 Wasp helicopters between November 1966 and June 1967, operated from ''Van Speijk''-class frigates as AH-12As and flown in the ASW role. The last of the Dutch Wasps were eventually withdrawn from service in 1981 when they were replaced by the Westland Lynx.\n\n===Other operators===\nThe Wasp was also in service with the [[Brazilian Navy|Brazilian]], [[Indonesian Navy|Indonesian]], and [[South African Navy|South African]] navies. The Indonesian aircraft are all former Dutch aircraft and were the last of the type in active service.\n\nThe last of the ten surplus Dutch Navy helicopters refurbished by Westland's for the Indonesian Navy was grounded in 1998. Flown by 400 Squadron (RON 400) from NAS Juanda, and when at sea were embarked upon the Indonesian Navy's ex UK Royal Navy {{sclass2-|Tribal| frigate|0}} and ex-Dutch Navy {{sclass-|Van Speijk|frigate|2}}s.\n\nThe Brazilian Navy operated the Wasp as the UH-2 & UH-2A taking delivery of three new build helicopters in April 1966 and a further seven ex-Royal Navy helicopters in 1977. 1\u00ba ''Esquadr\u00e3o de Helic\u00f3pteros de Emprego Geral'' (HU-1) flew the helicopters from Navy's {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer|5}} and {{sclass-|Allen M. Sumner|destroyer|5}}-class destroyers and the {{sclass-|Niter\u00f3i|frigate|2}}s.\n\nThe South African Navy received their first batch of ten new build airframes in 1963, which was followed by the delivery of a second batch of further 8 from 1973. Although only six were delivered due to the International arms embargo placed on South Africa during the apartheid regime. The Wasps were flown by 22 Flight, from [[Ysterplaat]], the unit subsequently became 22 Squadron, Maritime Command in 1976.

Like other artists of the time, Mantegna experimented with [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], e.g. by lowering the horizon in order to create a sense of greater monumentality. His flinty, metallic landscapes and somewhat stony figures give evidence of a fundamentally sculptural approach to painting. He also led a workshop that was the leading producer of [[Old master print|prints]] in [[Venice]] before 1500.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Youth and education===\n[[File:Andrea Mantegna 036.jpg|thumb|''The Agony in the Garden'' (right panel of the [[predella]] of the ''[[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]]'', 1455) [[National Gallery, London]] is the pinnacle of Mantegna's early style.]]\n\nMantegna was born in Isola di Carturo, [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]] close to [[Padua]] (now [[Italy]]), second son of a carpenter, Biagio. At the age of eleven he became the apprentice of [[Padua]]n painter [[Francesco Squarcione]]. Squarcione, whose original profession was tailoring, appears to have had a remarkable enthusiasm for ancient art, and a faculty for acting. Like his famous compatriot [[Francesco Petrarca|Petrarca]], Squarcione was an [[ancient Rome]] enthusiast: he traveled in Italy, and perhaps also in [[Greece]], collecting antique statues, reliefs, vases, etc., making drawings from them himself, then making available his collection for others to study. All the while, he continued undertaking works on commission, to which his pupils, no less than himself, contributed.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=602}}\n\nAs many as 137 painters and pictorial students passed through Squarcione's school, which had been established around 1440 and which became famous all over Italy. Padua attracted artists not only from the [[Veneto]] but also from [[Tuscany]], such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Filippo Lippi]] and [[Donatello]]; Mantegna's early career was shaped by impressions of Florentine works. At the time, Mantegna was said to be a favorite pupil of Squarcione, who taught him [[Latin]] and instructed him to study fragments of Roman [[sculpture]]. The master also preferred [[forced perspective]], recollection of which may account for some of Mantegna's later innovations. However, at the age of seventeen Mantegna left Squarcione's workshop. He later claimed that Squarcione had profited from his work without sufficient payment. \n\nMantegna's first work, now lost, was an altarpiece for the church of Santa Sofia in 1448. The same year he was called, together with Nicol\u00f2 Pizolo, to work with a large group of painters entrusted with the decoration of the [[Ovetari Chapel]] in the [[transept]] of the [[church of the Eremitani]]. It is probable, however, that before this time some of the pupils of Squarcione, including Mantegna, had already begun the series of frescoes in the chapel of S. Cristoforo, in the church of Sant'Agostino degli Eremitani, which are today considered a masterpiece. After a series of coincidences, Mantegna finished most of the work alone, though [[Ansuino da Forl\u00ec|Ansuino]], who collaborated with Mantegna in the Ovetari Chapel, brought his style from the Forl\u00ec school of painting. The now critical Squarcione carped about the earlier works of this series, illustrating the life of St James; he said the figures were like men made of stone, and should have been painted stone color.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=602}}\n\nThis series was almost entirely lost in the 1944 Allied bombings of [[Padua]]. The most dramatic work of the fresco cycle was the work set in the [[worm's-eye view]] perspective, ''[[St. James Led to His Execution]]''. (For an example of Mantegna's use of a lowered viewpoint, see the image at right of [[St. Peter|Saints Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]; though much less dramatic in its perspective than the ''St. James'' picture, the ''[[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno]]'' altarpiece was around 1455 not long after the St. James cycle was finished, and uses many of the same techniques, including an architectural structure based on Classical antiquity.)\n\nThe sketch for the ''St. Stephen'' fresco survived and is the earliest known preliminary sketch which still survives to compare with the corresponding fresco. The drawing shows proof that [[nude]] figures\u2014which were later painted as clothed\u2014were used in the conception of works during the [[Renaissance|Early Renaissance]]. In the preliminary sketch, the perspective is less developed and closer to a more average viewpoint however. Despite the authentic Classical look of the monument, it is not a copy of any known Roman structure. Mantegna also adopted the wet drapery patterns of the Romans, who took the form from the [[Greece|Greek]] invention, for the clothing of his figures, although the tense figures and interactions are derived from [[Donatello]].\n\nAmong the other early Mantegna frescoes are the two saints over the entrance porch of the church of [[Sant'Antonio (Padova)|Sant'Antonio]] in Padua, 1452, and the 1453 ''[[San Luca Altarpiece]]'', with [[St. Luke]] and other saints, for the church of [[Justina of Padua|S. Giustina]] and now in the [[Pinacoteca di Brera|Brera Gallery]] in [[Milan]]. As the young artist progressed in his work, he came under the influence of [[Jacopo Bellini]], father of the celebrated painters [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Gentile Bellini]], and met his daughter Nicolosia. In 1453 Jacopo consented to a marriage between Nicolosia and Mantegna.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=602}}\n\n===Aesthetic===\n[[File:Andrea Mantegna - Christ as the Suffering Redeemer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| ''[[Christ as the Suffering Redeemer]]''. Christ resurrecting, depicted according to Luke 24:1\u20132, praising the Lord with a hymn<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/christ-as-the-suffering-redeemer/UQEEgekhhaZ6Cw|title=christ-as-the-suffering-redeemer|publisher=www.google.com|accessdate=}}</ref> (c. 1488\u20131500)]]\n\nAndrea seems to have been influenced by his old preceptor's strictures, although his later subjects, for example, those from the legend of [[St. Christopher]], combine his sculptural style with a greater sense of naturalism and vivacity. Trained as he had been in the study of marbles and the severity of the antique, Mantegna openly avowed that he considered ancient art superior to nature as being more eclectic in form. As a result, the painter exercised precision in outline, privileging the figure. Overall, Mantegna's work thus tended towards rigidity, demonstrating an austere wholeness rather than graceful sensitivity of expression. His draperies are tight and closely folded, being studied (it is said) from models draped in paper and woven fabrics gummed in place. His figures are slim, muscular and bony; the action impetuous but of arrested energy. Finally, tawny landscape, gritty with littering pebbles, marks the athletic hauteur of his style.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=602}}\n\nMantegna never changed the manner which he had adopted in Padua, though his coloring\u2014at first neutral and undecided\u2014strengthened and matured. Throughout his works there is more balancing of color than fineness of tone. One of his great aims was optical illusion, carried out by a mastery of perspective which, though not always mathematically correct, attained an astonishing effect for the times.\n\nSuccessful and admired though he was there, Mantegna left his native Padua at an early age, and never returned there; the hostility of Squarcione has been cited as the cause. He spent the rest of his life in [[Verona]], [[Mantua]] and [[Rome]]; it has not been confirmed that he also stayed in [[Venice]] and [[Florence]].{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=602}} In Verona between 1457 and 1459, he painted a grand ''[[Altarpiece of San Zero (Mantegna)|altarpiece]]'' for the church of [[San Zeno Maggiore]], depicting a Madonna and angels, with four saints on each side [[:File:San Zeno Altarpiece.jpg| on the ''San Zeno Altarpiece'', central panel, San Zeno, Verona]]. It was probably the first good example of Renaissance art in Verona, and inspired a similar painting by the Veronese artist [[Girolamo dai Libri]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110000960 metmuseum Madonna and Child with Saints Girolamo dai Libri  (Italian, Verona 1474\u20131555 Verona) edit:2000 2012]</ref>\n\n===Work in Mantua===\n[[File:Andrea Mantegna or Follower (Possibly Giulio Campagnola) - Judith with the Head of Holofernes - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|upright| ''[[Judith and Holofernes (Mantegna)|Judith and Holofernes]]'', by Andrea Mantegna or possibly [[Giulio Campagnola]]]]\n\nThe Marquis [[Ludovico III Gonzaga]] of Mantua had for some time been pressing Mantegna to enter his service; and the following year, 1460 Mantegna was appointed [[court painter|court artist]]. He resided at first from time to time at [[Goito]], but, from December 1466 onwards, he moved with his family to Mantua. His engagement was for a salary of 75 [[Lira|lire]] a month, a sum so large for that period as to mark conspicuously the high regard in which his art was held. He was in fact the first painter of any eminence to be based in Mantua.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}}\n\nHis Mantuan masterpiece was painted for the court of Mantua, in the apartment of the Castle of the city, today known as [[Camera degli Sposi (Mantua)|Camera degli Sposi]] (literally, \"Wedding Chamber\") of [[Palazzo Ducale di Mantova|Palazzo Ducale]], [[Mantua]]: [[:File:Mantua Mantegna.jpg| a series of full compositions in fresco]] including various portraits of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] family and some figures of genii and others.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}} [[File:Sposi.jpg|thumb|200px|Detail of Camera degli Sposi]]\n\nThe Chamber's decoration was finished presumably in 1474. The ten years that followed were not happy ones for Mantegna and Mantua: Mantegna grew irritable, his son Bernardino died, as well as the Marchese Ludovico, his wife Barbara and his successor Federico (who had dubbed Mantegna ''cavaliere'', \"knight\" ). Only with the election of [[Francesco II of the House of Gonzaga]] did artistic commissions in Mantua recommence. He built a stately house in the area of the church of San Sebastiano, and adorned it with a multitude of paintings. The house can still be seen today, although the pictures no longer survive. In this period he began to collect some ancient Roman busts (which were given to [[Lorenzo de Medici]] when the [[Florence|Florentine]] leader visited Mantua in 1483), painted some architectonic and decorative fragments, and finished the intense ''[[St. Sebastian (Mantegna)|St. Sebastian]]'' now in the [[Louvre]] (''box at top'').\n\nIn 1488 Mantegna was called by [[Pope Innocent VIII]] to paint frescoes in a chapel Belvedere in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. This series of frescoes, including a noted ''Baptism of Christ'', was later destroyed by [[Pope Pius VI|Pius VI]] in 1780. The pope treated Mantegna with less liberality than he had been used to at the Mantuan court; but all things considered their connection, which ceased in 1500, was not unsatisfactory to either party.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}} Mantegna also met the famous [[Turkey|Turkish]] hostage Jem and carefully studied Rome's ancient monuments, but his impression of the city was a disappointing one overall. Returned to Mantua in 1490, he embraced again his more literary and bitter vision of antiquity, and entered in strong connection with the new Marchesa, the cultured and intelligent [[Isabella d'Este]].\n\nIn what was now his city he went on with the nine tempera pictures of the ''[[Triumph of Caesar (Mantegna)|Triumphs of Caesar]]'', which he had probably begun before his leaving for Rome, and which he finished around 1492. These superbly invented and designed compositions are gorgeous with the splendor of their subject matter, and with the classical learning and enthusiasm of one of the masters of the age. Considered Mantegna's finest work, they were sold in 1628 along with the bulk of the Mantuan art treasures to King [[Charles I of England]].{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}}\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:Madonna Cherubin Mantegna.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[The Madonna of the Cherubim]] ''(1485).]]\n\nDespite his declining health, Mantegna continued to paint. Other works of this period include the ''Madonna of the Caves'', the ''[[St. Sebastian (Mantegna)|St. Sebastian]]'' and the famous ''[[The Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Mantegna)|Lamentation over the Dead Christ]]'', probably painted for his personal funerary chapel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Another work of Mantegna's later years was what is known as the ''[[Madonna della Vittoria]]'', now in the [[Louvre]]. It was painted in tempera about 1495, in commemoration of the [[Battle of Fornovo]], whose questionable outcome [[Francesco II of Gonzaga|Francesco Gonzaga]] was eager to show as an [[Italy|Italian League]] victory; the church which originally housed the picture was built from Mantegna's own design. The Madonna is here depicted with various saints, the archangel Michael and St. Maurice holding her mantle, which is extended over the kneeling Francesco Gonzaga, amid a profusion of rich festooning and other accessories. Though not in all respects of his highest order of execution, this counts among the most obviously beautiful of Mantegna's works in which the qualities of beauty and attractiveness are less marked than those other excellences more germane to his severe genius, tense energy passing into haggard passion.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}}\n\nAfter 1497 Mantegna was commissioned by [[Isabella d'Este]] to translate the mythological themes written by the court poet Paride Ceresara into paintings for her private apartment (''[[Cabinet (architecture)|studiolo]]'') in the [[Palazzo Ducale di Mantova|Palazzo Ducale]]. These paintings were dispersed in the following years: one of them, the legend of the God Comus, was left unfinished by Mantegna and completed by his successor as court painter in Mantua, [[Lorenzo Costa]]. The other painters commissioned by Isabella for her [[studiolo]] were [[Perugino]] and [[Correggio]].\n\nAfter the death of his wife, Mantegna became at an advanced age the father of an illegitimate son, Giovanni Andrea; and, finally, although he continued embarking on various expenses and schemes, he had serious tribulations, such as the banishment from Mantua of his son Francesco, who had incurred the displeasure of the Marchese. The difficult situation of the aged master and connoisseur required the hard necessity of parting with a beloved antique bust of Faustina.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}}\n\nVery soon after this transaction he died in Mantua, on September 13, 1506. In 1516, a handsome monument was set up to him by his sons in the church of [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|Sant'Andrea]], where he had painted the altarpiece of the mortuary chapel.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}} The dome is decorated by [[Correggio]].\n\n==Engravings==\nMantegna was no less eminent as an [[engraver]], though his history in that respect is somewhat obscure, partly because he never signed or dated any of his plates, but for a single disputed instance of 1472. The account which has come down to us from [[Vasari]] (who was, as usual, keen to assert that everything flows from Florence) is that Mantegna began engraving in [[Rome]], prompted by the engravings produced by the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Baccio Baldini]] after [[Sandro Botticelli]].  This is now considered most unlikely as it would consign all the numerous and elaborate engravings made by Mantegna to the last sixteen or seventeen years of his life, which seems a brief period for them. Besides, the earlier engravings reflect an earlier period of his artistic style. It is possible that Mantegna may have begun engraving while still in [[Padua]], under the tuition of a distinguished goldsmith, Niccol\u00f2. He and his workshop engraved about thirty plates, according to the usual reckoning; large, full of figures, and highly studied. It is now considered either that he only engraved seven himself, or none.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}} Another artist from the workshop who made several plates is usually identified as [[Giovanni Antonio da Brescia]] (aka Zoan Andrea).\n\nAmong the principal examples are: [http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/pimage?64266+0+0 ''Battle of the Sea Monsters'']{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/pimage?106542+0+0 ''Virgin and Child'']{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, a ''Bacchanal Festival'', ''Hercules and Antaeus'', ''Marine Gods'', ''Judith with the Head of Holofernes'', the ''Deposition from the Cross'', the ''Entombment'', the ''Resurrection'', the ''Man of Sorrows'', the ''Virgin in a Grotto'', and several scenes from the ''Triumph of Julius Caesar'' after his paintings. Several of his engravings are supposed to be executed on some metal less hard than copper. The technique of himself and his followers is characterized by the strongly marked forms of the design, and by the parallel hatching used to produce shadows. The closer the parallel marks, the darker the shadows were. The prints are frequently to be found in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], or editions. In the first, the prints have been produced using a roller, or even by hand pressing, and they are weak in tint; in the second, a printing press has been used, and the ink is stronger.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}}\n\nNeither Mantegna or his workshop are now believed to have produced the so-called [[Mantegna Tarocchi]] cards.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Bacco - Mantegna, Andrea - Baccanale col tino -1470 ca.-.jpg|''Bacchanal with a wine vat'', [[engraving]] by Mantegna, c. 1475, 278 \u00d7 422 mm\nFile:Andrea Mantegna - The Lamentation over the Dead Christ - WGA13981.jpg|''[[The Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Mantegna)|The Lamentation over the Dead Christ]]''<br>Tempera on canvas, 68\u00d781 cm, 1490; [[Pinacoteca di Brera]], Milan.\n</gallery>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[Giorgio Vasari]] [[wikt:eulogize|eulogizes]] Mantegna, although pointing out his [[wikt:litigious|litigious]] character. He had been fond of his fellow pupils in [[Padua]]: and with two of them, Dario da Trevigi and [[Marco Zoppo]], he retained steady friendships. Mantegna became very expensive in his habits, fell at times into financial difficulties, and had to press his valid claims for payment upon the attention of the Marchese.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}}\n\nIn terms of Classical taste, Mantegna distanced all contemporary competition. Though substantially related to the 15th century, his influence on the style and trends of his age was very marked over Italian art generally. [[Giovanni Bellini]], in his earlier works, obviously followed the lead of his brother-in-law Andrea.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}} [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] was influenced by his style during his two trips in Italy, reproducing several of his engravings.<ref>Campbell, Angela and Raftery, Andrew. \"Remaking D\u00fcrer: Investigating the Master Engravings by Masterful Engraving,\" [http://artinprint.org/article/remaking-durer-investigating-the-master-engravings/ <i>Art in Print</i> Vol. 2 No. 4] (November\u2013December 2012).</ref> [[Leonardo da Vinci]] took from Mantegna the use of decorations with [[wikt:festoon|festoons]] and fruit.\n\nMantegna's main legacy in considered the introduction of spatial illusionism, both in frescoes and in ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' paintings: his tradition of ceiling decoration was followed for almost three centuries. Starting from the faint cupola of the [[Palazzo Ducale di Mantova|Camera degli Sposi]], [[Correggio]] built on the research of his master and collaborator into perspective constructions, eventually producing a masterwork like the dome of [[Cathedral of Parma]].\n\n==Major works==\n[[File:Central panel - Pala di San Zeno by Andrea Mantegna - San Zeno - Verona 2016.jpg|thumb|The Virgin Mary in

Like other artists of the time, Mantegna experimented with [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], e.g. by lowering the horizon in order to create a sense of greater monumentality. His flinty, metallic landscapes and somewhat stony figures give evidence of a fundamentally sculptural approach to painting. He also led a workshop that was the leading producer of [[Old master print|prints]] in [[Venice]] before 1500.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Youth and education===\n[[File:Andrea Mantegna 036.jpg|thumb|''The Agony in the Garden'' (right panel of the [[predella]] of the ''[[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]]'', 1455) [[National Gallery, London]] is the pinnacle of Mantegna's early style.]]\n\nMantegna was born in Isola di Carturo, [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]] close to [[Padua]] (now [[Italy]]), second son of a carpenter, Biagio. At the age of eleven he became the apprentice of [[Padua]]n painter [[Francesco Squarcione]]. Squarcione, whose original profession was tailoring, appears to have had a remarkable enthusiasm for ancient art, and a faculty for acting. Like his famous compatriot [[Francesco Petrarca|Petrarca]], Squarcione was an [[ancient Rome]] enthusiast: he traveled in Italy, and perhaps also in [[Greece]], collecting antique statues, reliefs, vases, etc., making drawings from them himself, then making available his collection for others to study. All the while, he continued undertaking works on commission, to which his pupils, no less than himself, contributed.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=602}}\n\nAs many as 137 painters and pictorial students passed through Squarcione's school, which had been established around 1440 and which became famous all over Italy. Padua attracted artists not only from the [[Veneto]] but also from [[Tuscany]], such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Filippo Lippi]] and [[Donatello]]; Mantegna's early career was shaped by impressions of Florentine works. At the time, Mantegna was said to be a favorite pupil of Squarcione, who taught him [[Latin]] and instructed him to study fragments of Roman [[sculpture]]. The master also preferred [[forced perspective]], recollection of which may account for some of Mantegna's later innovations. However, at the age of seventeen Mantegna left Squarcione's workshop. He later claimed that Squarcione had profited from his work without sufficient payment. \n\nMantegna's first work, now lost, was an altarpiece for the church of Santa Sofia in 1448. The same year he was called, together with Nicol\u00f2 Pizolo, to work with a large group of painters entrusted with the decoration of the [[Ovetari Chapel]] in the [[transept]] of the [[church of the Eremitani]]. It is probable, however, that before this time some of the pupils of Squarcione, including Mantegna, had already begun the series of frescoes in the chapel of S. Cristoforo, in the church of Sant'Agostino degli Eremitani, which are today considered a masterpiece. After a series of coincidences, Mantegna finished most of the work alone, though [[Ansuino da Forl\u00ec|Ansuino]], who collaborated with Mantegna in the Ovetari Chapel, brought his style from the Forl\u00ec school of painting. The now critical Squarcione carped about the earlier works of this series, illustrating the life of St James; he said the figures were like men made of stone, and should have been painted stone color.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=602}}\n\nThis series was almost entirely lost in the 1944 Allied bombings of [[Padua]]. The most dramatic work of the fresco cycle was the work set in the [[worm's-eye view]] perspective, ''[[St. James Led to His Execution]]''. (For an example of Mantegna's use of a lowered viewpoint, see the image at right of [[St. Peter|Saints Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]; though much less dramatic in its perspective than the ''St. James'' picture, the ''[[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno]]'' altarpiece was around 1455 not long after the St. James cycle was finished, and uses many of the same techniques, including an architectural structure based on Classical antiquity.)\n\nThe sketch for the ''St. Stephen'' fresco survived and is the earliest known preliminary sketch which still survives to compare with the corresponding fresco. The drawing shows proof that [[nude]] figures\u2014which were later painted as clothed\u2014were used in the conception of works during the [[Renaissance|Early Renaissance]]. In the preliminary sketch, the perspective is less developed and closer to a more average viewpoint however. Despite the authentic Classical look of the monument, it is not a copy of any known Roman structure. Mantegna also adopted the wet drapery patterns of the Romans, who took the form from the [[Greece|Greek]] invention, for the clothing of his figures, although the tense figures and interactions are derived from [[Donatello]].\n\nAmong the other early Mantegna frescoes are the two saints over the entrance porch of the church of [[Sant'Antonio (Padova)|Sant'Antonio]] in Padua, 1452, and the 1453 ''[[San Luca Altarpiece]]'', with [[St. Luke]] and other saints, for the church of [[Justina of Padua|S. Giustina]] and now in the [[Pinacoteca di Brera|Brera Gallery]] in [[Milan]]. As the young artist progressed in his work, he came under the influence of [[Jacopo Bellini]], father of the celebrated painters [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Gentile Bellini]], and met his daughter Nicolosia. In 1453 Jacopo consented to a marriage between Nicolosia and Mantegna.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=602}}\n\n===Aesthetic===\n[[File:Andrea Mantegna - Christ as the Suffering Redeemer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| ''[[Christ as the Suffering Redeemer]]''. Christ resurrecting, depicted according to Luke 24:1\u20132, praising the Lord with a hymn<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/christ-as-the-suffering-redeemer/UQEEgekhhaZ6Cw|title=christ-as-the-suffering-redeemer|publisher=www.google.com|accessdate=}}</ref> (c. 1488\u20131500)]]\n\nAndrea seems to have been influenced by his old preceptor's strictures, although his later subjects, for example, those from the legend of [[St. Christopher]], combine his sculptural style with a greater sense of naturalism and vivacity. Trained as he had been in the study of marbles and the severity of the antique, Mantegna openly avowed that he considered ancient art superior to nature as being more eclectic in form. As a result, the painter exercised precision in outline, privileging the figure. Overall, Mantegna's work thus tended towards rigidity, demonstrating an austere wholeness rather than graceful sensitivity of expression. His draperies are tight and closely folded, being studied (it is said) from models draped in paper and woven fabrics gummed in place. His figures are slim, muscular and bony; the action impetuous but of arrested energy. Finally, tawny landscape, gritty with littering pebbles, marks the athletic hauteur of his style.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=602}}\n\nMantegna never changed the manner which he had adopted in Padua, though his coloring\u2014at first neutral and undecided\u2014strengthened and matured. Throughout his works there is more balancing of color than fineness of tone. One of his great aims was optical illusion, carried out by a mastery of perspective which, though not always mathematically correct, attained an astonishing effect for the times.\n\nSuccessful and admired though he was there, Mantegna left his native Padua at an early age, and never returned there; the hostility of Squarcione has been cited as the cause. He spent the rest of his life in [[Verona]], [[Mantua]] and [[Rome]]; it has not been confirmed that he also stayed in [[Venice]] and [[Florence]].{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=602}} In Verona between 1457 and 1459, he painted a grand ''[[Altarpiece of San Zero (Mantegna)|altarpiece]]'' for the church of [[San Zeno Maggiore]], depicting a Madonna and angels, with four saints on each side [[:File:San Zeno Altarpiece.jpg| on the ''San Zeno Altarpiece'', central panel, San Zeno, Verona]]. It was probably the first good example of Renaissance art in Verona, and inspired a similar painting by the Veronese artist [[Girolamo dai Libri]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110000960 metmuseum Madonna and Child with Saints Girolamo dai Libri  (Italian, Verona 1474\u20131555 Verona) edit:2000 2012]</ref>\n\n===Work in Mantua===\n[[File:Andrea Mantegna or Follower (Possibly Giulio Campagnola) - Judith with the Head of Holofernes - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|upright| ''[[Judith and Holofernes (Mantegna)|Judith and Holofernes]]'', by Andrea Mantegna or possibly [[Giulio Campagnola]]]]\n\nThe Marquis [[Ludovico III Gonzaga]] of Mantua had for some time been pressing Mantegna to enter his service; and the following year, 1460 Mantegna was appointed [[court painter|court artist]]. He resided at first from time to time at [[Goito]], but, from December 1466 onwards, he moved with his family to Mantua. His engagement was for a salary of 75 [[Lira|lire]] a month, a sum so large for that period as to mark conspicuously the high regard in which his art was held. He was in fact the first painter of any eminence to be based in Mantua.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}}\n\nHis Mantuan masterpiece was painted for the court of Mantua, in the apartment of the Castle of the city, today known as [[Camera degli Sposi (Mantua)|Camera degli Sposi]] (literally, \"Wedding Chamber\") of [[Palazzo Ducale di Mantova|Palazzo Ducale]], [[Mantua]]: [[:File:Mantua Mantegna.jpg| a series of full compositions in fresco]] including various portraits of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] family and some figures of genii and others.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}} [[File:Sposi.jpg|thumb|200px|Detail of Camera degli Sposi]]\n\nThe Chamber's decoration was finished presumably in 1474. The ten years that followed were not happy ones for Mantegna and Mantua: Mantegna grew irritable, his son Bernardino died, as well as the Marchese Ludovico, his wife Barbara and his successor Federico (who had dubbed Mantegna ''cavaliere'', \"knight\" ). Only with the election of [[Francesco II of the House of Gonzaga]] did artistic commissions in Mantua recommence. He built a stately house in the area of the church of San Sebastiano, and adorned it with a multitude of paintings. The house can still be seen today, although the pictures no longer survive. In this period he began to collect some ancient Roman busts (which were given to [[Lorenzo de Medici]] when the [[Florence|Florentine]] leader visited Mantua in 1483), painted some architectonic and decorative fragments, and finished the intense ''[[St. Sebastian (Mantegna)|St. Sebastian]]'' now in the [[Louvre]] (''box at top'').\n\nIn 1488 Mantegna was called by [[Pope Innocent VIII]] to paint frescoes in a chapel Belvedere in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. This series of frescoes, including a noted ''Baptism of Christ'', was later destroyed by [[Pope Pius VI|Pius VI]] in 1780. The pope treated Mantegna with less liberality than he had been used to at the Mantuan court; but all things considered their connection, which ceased in 1500, was not unsatisfactory to either party.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}} Mantegna also met the famous [[Turkey|Turkish]] hostage Jem and carefully studied Rome's ancient monuments, but his impression of the city was a disappointing one overall. Returned to Mantua in 1490, he embraced again his more literary and bitter vision of antiquity, and entered in strong connection with the new Marchesa, the cultured and intelligent [[Isabella d'Este]].\n\nIn what was now his city he went on with the nine tempera pictures of the ''[[Triumph of Caesar (Mantegna)|Triumphs of Caesar]]'', which he had probably begun before his leaving for Rome, and which he finished around 1492. These superbly invented and designed compositions are gorgeous with the splendor of their subject matter, and with the classical learning and enthusiasm of one of the masters of the age. Considered Mantegna's finest work, they were sold in 1628 along with the bulk of the Mantuan art treasures to King [[Charles I of England]].{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}}\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:Madonna Cherubin Mantegna.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[The Madonna of the Cherubim]] ''(1485).]]\n\nDespite his declining health, Mantegna continued to paint. Other works of this period include the ''Madonna of the Caves'', the ''[[St. Sebastian (Mantegna)|St. Sebastian]]'' and the famous ''[[The Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Mantegna)|Lamentation over the Dead Christ]]'', probably painted for his personal funerary chapel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Another work of Mantegna's later years was what is known as the ''[[Madonna della Vittoria]]'', now in the [[Louvre]]. It was painted in tempera about 1495, in commemoration of the [[Battle of Fornovo]], whose questionable outcome [[Francesco II of Gonzaga|Francesco Gonzaga]] was eager to show as an [[Italy|Italian League]] victory; the church which originally housed the picture was built from Mantegna's own design. The Madonna is here depicted with various saints, the archangel Michael and St. Maurice holding her mantle, which is extended over the kneeling Francesco Gonzaga, amid a profusion of rich festooning and other accessories. Though not in all respects of his highest order of execution, this counts among the most obviously beautiful of Mantegna's works in which the qualities of beauty and attractiveness are less marked than those other excellences more germane to his severe genius, tense energy passing into haggard passion.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}}\n\nAfter 1497 Mantegna was commissioned by [[Isabella d'Este]] to translate the mythological themes written by the court poet Paride Ceresara into paintings for her private apartment (''[[Cabinet (architecture)|studiolo]]'') in the [[Palazzo Ducale di Mantova|Palazzo Ducale]]. These paintings were dispersed in the following years: one of them, the legend of the God Comus, was left unfinished by Mantegna and completed by his successor as court painter in Mantua, [[Lorenzo Costa]]. The other painters commissioned by Isabella for her [[studiolo]] were [[Perugino]] and [[Correggio]].\n\nAfter the death of his wife, Mantegna became at an advanced age the father of an illegitimate son, Giovanni Andrea; and, finally, although he continued embarking on various expenses and schemes, he had serious tribulations, such as the banishment from Mantua of his son Francesco, who had incurred the displeasure of the Marchese. The difficult situation of the aged master and connoisseur required the hard necessity of parting with a beloved antique bust of Faustina.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}}\n\nVery soon after this transaction he died in Mantua, on September 13, 1506. In 1516, a handsome monument was set up to him by his sons in the church of [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|Sant'Andrea]], where he had painted the altarpiece of the mortuary chapel.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}} The dome is decorated by [[Correggio]].\n\n==Engravings==\nMantegna was no less eminent as an [[engraver]], though his history in that respect is somewhat obscure, partly because he never signed or dated any of his plates, but for a single disputed instance of 1472. The account which has come down to us from [[Vasari]] (who was, as usual, keen to assert that everything flows from Florence) is that Mantegna began engraving in [[Rome]], prompted by the engravings produced by the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Baccio Baldini]] after [[Sandro Botticelli]].  This is now considered most unlikely as it would consign all the numerous and elaborate engravings made by Mantegna to the last sixteen or seventeen years of his life, which seems a brief period for them. Besides, the earlier engravings reflect an earlier period of his artistic style. It is possible that Mantegna may have begun engraving while still in [[Padua]], under the tuition of a distinguished goldsmith, Niccol\u00f2. He and his workshop engraved about thirty plates, according to the usual reckoning; large, full of figures, and highly studied. It is now considered either that he only engraved seven himself, or none.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}} Another artist from the workshop who made several plates is usually identified as [[Giovanni Antonio da Brescia]] (aka Zoan Andrea).\n\nAmong the principal examples are: [http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/pimage?64266+0+0 ''Battle of the Sea Monsters'']{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/pimage?106542+0+0 ''Virgin and Child'']{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, a ''Bacchanal Festival'', ''Hercules and Antaeus'', ''Marine Gods'', ''Judith with the Head of Holofernes'', the ''Deposition from the Cross'', the ''Entombment'', the ''Resurrection'', the ''Man of Sorrows'', the ''Virgin in a Grotto'', and several scenes from the ''Triumph of Julius Caesar'' after his paintings. Several of his engravings are supposed to be executed on some metal less hard than copper. The technique of himself and his followers is characterized by the strongly marked forms of the design, and by the parallel hatching used to produce shadows. The closer the parallel marks, the darker the shadows were. The prints are frequently to be found in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], or editions. In the first, the prints have been produced using a roller, or even by hand pressing, and they are weak in tint; in the second, a printing press has been used, and the ink is stronger.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}}\n\nNeither Mantegna or his workshop are now believed to have produced the so-called [[Mantegna Tarocchi]] cards.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Bacco - Mantegna, Andrea - Baccanale col tino -1470 ca.-.jpg|''Bacchanal with a wine vat'', [[engraving]] by Mantegna, c. 1475, 278 \u00d7 422 mm\nFile:Andrea Mantegna - The Lamentation over the Dead Christ - WGA13981.jpg|''[[The Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Mantegna)|The Lamentation over the Dead Christ]]''<br>Tempera on canvas, 68\u00d781 cm, 1490; [[Pinacoteca di Brera]], Milan.\n</gallery>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[Giorgio Vasari]] [[wikt:eulogize|eulogizes]] Mantegna, although pointing out his [[wikt:litigious|litigious]] character. He had been fond of his fellow pupils in [[Padua]]: and with two of them, Dario da Trevigi and [[Marco Zoppo]], he retained steady friendships. Mantegna became very expensive in his habits, fell at times into financial difficulties, and had to press his valid claims for payment upon the attention of the Marchese.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}}\n\nIn terms of Classical taste, Mantegna distanced all contemporary competition. Though substantially related to the 15th century, his influence on the style and trends of his age was very marked over Italian art generally. [[Giovanni Bellini]], in his earlier works, obviously followed the lead of his brother-in-law Andrea.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=603}} [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] was influenced by his style during his two trips in Italy, reproducing several of his engravings.<ref>Campbell, Angela and Raftery, Andrew. \"Remaking D\u00fcrer: Investigating the Master Engravings by Masterful Engraving,\" [http://artinprint.org/article/remaking-durer-investigating-the-master-engravings/ <i>Art in Print</i> Vol. 2 No. 4] (November\u2013December 2012).</ref> [[Leonardo da Vinci]] took from Mantegna the use of decorations with [[wikt:festoon|festoons]] and fruit.\n\nMantegna's main legacy in considered the introduction of spatial illusionism, both in frescoes and in ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' paintings: his tradition of ceiling decoration was followed for almost three centuries. Starting from the faint cupola of the [[Palazzo Ducale di Mantova|Camera degli Sposi]], [[Correggio]] built on the research of his master and collaborator into perspective constructions, eventually producing a masterwork like the dome of [[Cathedral of Parma]].\n\n==Major works==\n[[File:Central panel - Pala di San Zeno by Andrea Mantegna - San Zeno - Verona 2016.jpg|thumb|The Virgin Mary in

The selection centre is attached to two large hangars, plus the candidates' mess. The centre is home to everything required by a candidate during their selection. This includes a large aptitude testing centre, medical centre (including an optician and a hearing testing facility), interview rooms, syndicate rooms and the leadership exercises.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1947 the '''Aviation Candidate Selection Board''' was established at [[RAF Hornchurch]]<ref>Richard C Smith, Second To None, p134, Grub Street, 2004, {{ISBN|1-904010-78-4}}</ref> following the closure of the '''Combined Selection Centre''' at [[RAF North Weald]]. In 1952 the name was changed to '''Aircrew Selection Centre'''. The centre closed with the airfield in 1962 and was transferred to [[RAF Biggin Hill]]. In 1992 it was decided to transfer the selection centre to its current location at [[RAF Cranwell]].<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm198889/cmhansrd/1989-03-07/Writtens-6.html Hansard on questions to Secretary of State on move to RAF Cranwell from RAF Biggin Hill]</ref>\n\n==Selection process==\n\nThe selection procedure takes three days and is in three parts. Phase 1 comprises [[aptitude]] tests.<ref>[http://www.gapan.org/careers/aptitude.htm Guild of  Air Pilot and Navigators]</ref> The length of the aptitude test phase will vary depending on the branches that the candidate has applied for or is eligible for. A full debrief is given after the aptitude tests, and those who have failed to make the required standard will leave selection at this point.\n\nIf successful you proceed to Phase 2 which consists of the exercise phase. The OASC group will be issued coveralls and bibs, and will be divided into syndicates, in which they will remain until the completion of this phase on day 2. In the afternoon of day 1, syndicates will take part in a Group discussion and Group planning exercise. A briefing will be given before each of these commence so candidates are fully aware of what is required from them. The completion of these exercises concludes day 1 of OASC testing.\n\nDay 2 of OASC sees syndicates completing the Leaderless exercise, Command Situation Exercise and Individual planning exercise. The Leaderless and Command Situation Exercises are conducted in a purpose built hangar. The scenarios generally require the team to travel from one point to another, moving from obstacle to obstacle, whilst observing certain restrictions. i.e. transfer Alpha syndicate and a burden (barrel or drum) from point A to point B without touching the floor, to be completed within a time frame of 15 minutes.\n\nThis completes the exercise phase in the afternoon of day 2. A second session of reviews is held by the boarding officers, and candidates will be informed if they have been selected for the final stages of testing. Those who are unsuccessful will be debriefed and return home.\n\nFor those who are selected to finish OASC, medicals will commence on the afternoon of day 2. As with aptitude testing, the nature and therefore length of the medical will vary depending on the branch choice the candidate has made. Those applying for aircrew or controller positions can expect their medicals to continue into day 3. Those applying for other branches may finish their medicals early on day 2, and the boarding officers may wish to commence interviews before the end of the day to avoid delays on day 3.\n\nDay 3 at OASC consists of any outstanding medicals that need to be completed, the final interview, and the RAF fitness test. This should take up till lunch time, after which candidates are free to leave. There is no final debrief once selection has been completed.\n\nSuccessful candidates are notified at a later date and are invited to attend Initial Officer Training (IOT). For those who are unsuccessful, the selection board will aim to provide a full debrief to the candidate via their local AFCO.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Potential Regiment Officers course]] (RAF Regiment)\n*[[Army Officer Selection Board]] (Army)\n*[[Admiralty Interview Board]] (Navy)\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcranwell/aboutus/oasc.cfm RAF Website]\n\n{{Royal Air Force}}\n\n[[Category:North Kesteven District]]\n[[Category:Military history of Lincolnshire]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1992]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Lincolnshire]]\n[[Category:Royal Air Force]]\n[[Category:Selection of British military officers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2016}}\n{{Infobox company |\n  name     = Officer and Aircrew Selection Centre |\n  logo     =  <!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Officer and aircrew selection.jpg]]  -->|\n  type     = Part of the RAF|\n  foundation       = 1992|\n  location_city    = Cranwell|\n  location_country = UK |\n  industry         = [[Armed forces]]|\n  services        = Officer Training|\n  homepage       = [http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcranwell/aboutus/oasc.cfm RAF Cranwell Officer and Aircrew Selection Homepage]\n}}\n\nThe [[Royal Air Force]] '''Officer and Aircrew Selection Centre''', located at Adastral Hall, [[RAF Cranwell]], is the centre through which every potential RAF officer must go to be selected for Initial Officer Training (IOT) and through which potential [[non-commissioned officer|non-commissioned]] [[aircrew]] must go to be selected for the Non-Commissioned Aircrew Initial Training Course (NCAITC).

John Timmins was initially a member of the band but left the group before the recording of their first album.<ref name=\"86 Promo sheet\"/> The band line-up has never changed since, although they use several guest musicians on many of their albums, including multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bird who has performed on every album except the first.\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies' 1986 debut album, produced by Canadian producer [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], was the [[blues]]-inspired ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'', recorded in the family garage using a single [[Ambisonics|ambisonic]] microphone.<ref name=EMC/>\n\nThe band gained wide recognition with their second album, ''[[The Trinity Session]],'' recorded in 1987 at Toronto's [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]]. Their sound, again using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of [[blues]], [[country music|country]], [[American folk music|folk]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[jazz]] earned them both critical attention and a strong fan base. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' named the recording one of the 10 best albums of 1988.<ref name=EMC/>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies have gone on to record 16 studio albums and five live albums, and have remained an active band into the late 2010s.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history===\nAlan Anton and Michael Timmins, lifelong friends who met in kindergarten, formed their first band in high school. In 1979, influenced by post-punk bands such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[Joy Division]], they recruited drummer Geoff Railton and singer Liza Dawson-Whisker, and formed Hunger Project in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/whitesoff/open.html |title=Whites Off Earth Now {{!}} Backstory |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://littlevillagemag.com/prairie-pop-an-interview-with-michael-timmins-of-the-cowboy-junkies/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017152650/https://littlevillagemag.com/prairie-pop-an-interview-with-michael-timmins-of-the-cowboy-junkies/ |title=An interview with Michael Timmins of the Cowboy Junkies |work=Little Village |date=October 23, 2013 |archivedate=October 17, 2015 |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |author=McLeod, Kembrew |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-01/entertainment/ca-236_1_country-music |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029134019/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-01/entertainment/ca-236_1_country-music |title=The Cowboy Junkies' Addicting Vision : At its best, the band plays country music with a Velvet Underground twang |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 1, 1989 |archivedate=October 29, 2015 |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |author=Hilburn, Robert |url-status=live }}</ref> They moved to [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]] and performed at a variety of clubs. In early 1981, the Hunger Project embarked on a multi-city tour of the United States. After that, Hunger Project moved to the United Kingdom, where they toured for three months and released the  single \"The Same Inside/Assembly\" on their independent label, [[Latent Recordings]].<ref name=\"86 Promo sheet\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mypage.bluewin.ch:80/palesun/articles/CBJ86promo.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511211421/http://www.mypage.bluewin.ch/palesun/articles/CBJ86promo.html |title=1986 promo sheet |website=palesun's Cowboy Junkies fan pages |date=May 11, 2006 |archivedate=May 11, 2006 |accessdate=April 26, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWhen Hunger Project disbanded, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins remained in London and started an improvisational band named Germinal. The members \u2013 Michael Timmins on guitar, Alan Anton on bass, a drummer, and saxophonist, played whatever they wished on their instruments at the same time. Germinal released two LPs (''Germinal 1'' and ''Din''). The music newspaper New Musical Express said Germinal \"ranks among the most innovative and aggressive sounds to emerge from the independent scene this year.\" Alan Anton and Michael Timmins had a somewhat different take, saying, \"It was the ultimate release for us. But for the audience, it was quite a chore.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/cowboy-junkies |title=Cowboy Junkies |website=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=June 11, 2018}}</ref>  In London, they developed journeyman skills as musicians, and expanded their knowledge of music history \u2014 Michael Timmins worked in a record store for a year to make ends meet while with Germinal. Among those who were to influence Michael Timmins and Alan Anton were jazz musicians [[Cecil Taylor]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[John Coltrane]], along with the sound of early blues musicians [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Bukka White]], and [[Robert Johnson]].<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> Germinal broke up after three years in autumn of 1984. Alan Anton moved to Berlin and Michael Timmins returned to New York City.<ref name=\"86 Promo sheet\"/>\n\nUpon their return to Toronto in 1985, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins rented a house, insulated the tiny garage, and, with younger brother Pete Timmins sitting in on drums, began exploring a new musical direction. Margo was drafted to join and recalls, \"I was contemplating going on to graduate school, staying in school. That was safe. I never wanted to be a musician or be onstage.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> Nevertheless, Michael Timmins began to hear something in what they were doing with their initial jams, realizing that a female voice was what the band needed. Michael Timmins said, \"I thought if you had this female voice on top of it, you could do anything you wanted.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/>\n\nHowever, the slow musical tempos and whispery, hushed tones that defined their early work was not just musical inspiration, but came about by necessity. Their recording studio was their repurposed garage, which was just behind the house and bordered closely with their neighbours. On their first jam session, the police showed up due to a noise complaint from the neighbour.<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> According to Michael Timmins, \"We realized we had to tone down. One thing fed into the other: Margo began to realize that her singing voice was more effective quiet. We began to realize, if we can get down underneath Margo, the sound will be more effective. Pete picked up brushes \u2013 he was just learning to play drums at that point. Everything sort of came down. We learned to play with less volume.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/>\n\nWhen the unnamed band was preparing for its first gig, they members considered various names before choosing Cowboy Junkies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/8828140/Cowboy-Junkies-QandA-with-Margo-Timmins.html |title=Cowboy Junkies: Q&A with Margo Timmins |work=The Telegraph |date=October 17, 2011 |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |author=Chilton, Martin}}</ref> During their early gigs the band would perform at the Rivoli which had a small space in the back. The group would perform a rhythmic groove while Margo sang improvised vocal melodies and portions of old blues songs. Many times the Junkies entire performance would be a single jam session.<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/>\n\n[[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], a recording enthusiast who had ambitions of becoming a producer, was at their very first show. According to Moore, \"I was mesmerized by Margo.

They sold 3,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Barclay, Michael |author2=Jack, Ian A.D. |author3=Schneider, Jason |year=2001 |title=Have Not Been The Same: The Canrock Renaissance, 1985-1995 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xLIiOE_jCpAC&pg=PT528&lpg=PT528&dq=cowboy+junkies+peter+moore+1985#v=onepage&q=cowboy%20junkies%20peter%20moore%201985&f=false |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada |publisher=ECW Press|isbn=9781554909681 }}</ref> The band then toured the US. Michael Timmins described the experience: \"While touring ''Whites'' we had spent a lot of time in the Southern states, especially Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas. For some reason the club owners down there took a liking to what we were doing so we spent a lot of time crossing the kudzu choked highways that ran through the heart of the old Confederacy. Those were the days when having to spend a night in a hotel room would mean the difference between eating the next day or paying for the gas to get us to the next town, so we spent a lot of our time sleeping on the floors of friendly promoters, fans, waitresses and bartenders.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/blog/archives/4313 |title=A Look Back At\u2026.The Trinity Session (history \u2013 part 1 of 3) |website=Latent Recordings |date=November 6, 2014 |accessdate=April 4, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael}}</ref>\n\nThe band's next project, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'', became their breakthrough. Peter Moore again produced the album. They approached the project as a reaction against the MIDI\u2013dominated musical styles of the '80s. Moore said, \"I was angry that music had gotten into drum machines and MIDI. No humanity, no nothing. I'm listening to these recordings from the '50s with two or three mics and I'm going, 'Man that's real music.'\" He chose the [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]] in Toronto for its natural reverb. To better persuade the officials of the historic church, Moore claimed \"The Timmins Family Singers\" were recording a Christmas special.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinitysession/index8.html |title=Trinity Sessions {{!}} Page 8 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael}}</ref> The session began early on November 27, 1987. Songs with the fewest instruments were recorded first, and then the songs with gradually more complex arrangements. In this way Moore was able to solve acoustic problems one by one. To better balance Margo's vocals against the electric guitars and drums, she was recorded through a PA system left behind by a previous group. By making subtle changes in volume and placement relative to the microphone over six hours, Moore and the band finally reached the distinctive sound of the album.<ref name=\"Sound on Sound\"/>\n\nMusic critic for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, [[Anthony DeCurtis]], summed up the result of the group's efforts in a four-star review of the album: \"The Trinity Session is in the great tradition of albums that establish a mood and sustain it so consistently that the entire record seems like one continuously unfolding song. The mood in this instance is hypnotic and introspective \u2013 an intense, melancholic longing that blends the elemental emotions of country music and the blues with the poetic world-weariness of the Velvet Underground.\" . . . \"Having good songs, the skill to convey what they have to say and, most important, a vision, the Cowboy Junkies dispensed with high-tech trumpery and made their record simply and seriously. That attitude helped make the album as important as it is inspiring.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/rollingstone_tts.html |title=Rolling Stone Review of The Trinity Session |website=Junkies Fan |date=February 9, 1989 |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |author=DeCurtis, Anthony}}</ref>\n\nThe album was included in the book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 albums you must hear before you die |date=2006 |publisher=Universe |others=Dimery, Robert. |isbn=0789313715 |location=New York, NY |oclc=63515375}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe band's third album was more challenging, requiring three attempts to get the sound the band desired. Yet despite the problems with the making of it, the band considers it a very exciting and turbulent time in their career and state that ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' remains one of their favourite albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index2.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 2 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>  The band rented a small recording studio in the docklands of Toronto with the intention of using the room like the garage their first album was recorded in, instead of a room with live acoustics like the church room they used for ''The Trinity Session''. The session went badly because the group had just come off the road after a gruelling tour and were tired, particularly Margo Timmins who had a terrible head cold. After a few hours they realized the session wasn't working out, and they left.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index3.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe second attempt was made on April 21 of 1987 when [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]] rented the [[Sharon Temple]], an historic landmark located in the village of Sharon, Ontario. Michael Timmins recalls, \"The arrangements that we had developed for this new set of songs were at times so full and lush, unlike the spareness of most of Trinity's songs, that we were immediately confronted with the problem of how to control this swirl of sound so that it didn't just turn to mush on tape. Another problem was that the Temple was a lot more acoustically lively than any of us had imagined. As a result when the music swelled it would often spill over into Margo's vocal mic and feedback.\" At the end of three days during which the temperature would drop below freezing,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 4 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> Michael Timmins states, \"When we packed up and left Sharon that day I don't think that any of us felt that we had captured anything special. It had been a difficult three days and I think that we were all just happy that on that third day we had at least made some decent recordings of the songs if not necessarily memorable ones.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index5.html|title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 5 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> Over the next several months the band were touring and playing songs on the Sharon tape. As the band listened, new ideas for them evolved. They also wrote additional songs. Although the band truly loved recordings, the songs continued to develop on stage, and they believed the session no longer accurately represented where they were as a band.\n\nAt the end of the tour, they decided to go into Eastern Studios in downtown Toronto and reinvent how they recorded themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index6.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 6 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' sessions went quickly and smoothly, and were recorded over several days in December 1989. Michael Timmins believes: \"The beauty of the recording and one of the reasons it remains one of our favourites is that it captures the essence of the band which magically fell together during the recording of The Trinity Session and which forged its own voice, under the glare of a very intense spotlight, in the clubs and concert halls of the world.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index7.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 7 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith their next album, ''[[Black Eyed Man]]'', Michael Timmins wanted to explore music structure, specifically time shifts and tempo shifts; while Margo Timmins wanted to expand her singing style and her range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |title=The Cowboy Junkies: The Way They Groove Together {{!}} Music Express {{!}} March 1992 |website=JunkiesFan.com |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |author=Finlay, Liza}}</ref> Several musicians from previous albums showed up during the rehearsal sessions, along with about twenty five other Toronto players that were known to the band, or recruited because of their skills with instruments the band wanted to include in the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Black Eyed Man {{!}} Page 4 |website=Latent Recordings|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> Realizing he needed a theme to hold the album together what Michael Timmins decided upon was \"love found, love lost and love betrayed - it was to be the journey of the faceless, nameless and haunted Black Eyed Man.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index3.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Black Eyed Man {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe band's fifth album, ''[[Pale Sun, Crescent Moon]]'' is a song cycle about male-female relationships.

While it hasn't exactly turned into a hard-rock band (the closely drawn, highly literate, mood-conscious internal monologue remains the signature of the band's style), those aggressive opening and closing moments do signal a desire to avoid being typecast as that whispering band that found success by recording in an echoing church.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-07/entertainment/ca-43281_1_cowboy-junkies |title=A New Song and Dance for the Cowboy Junkies : Music: The group's 'Pale Sun, Crescent Moon' takes a more aggressive approach than the albums that gave the band its signature hushed sound. |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 7, 1994 |accessdate=April 27, 2018 |author=Boehm, Mike}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkie's sixth album, ''[[Lay It Down (Cowboy Junkies album)|Lay It Down]]'', was one in which the group wanted to make the music outside of Toronto and away from usual routines, so they searched for a place that was a comfortable drive away from Toronto, but would feel remote.  Alan Anton recalls, \"We found Rock Island, named not for music but for geology.  It is actually one big rock with stuff growing on it and has one small house with a great stone fireplace. We went there for a week at a time and between chopping wood, cooking, boating, whittling, hiking and staring into the fire, worked up some songs that were as laid back and sparse as the setting.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Lay It Down {{!}} Page 1 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref> When the Junkies went to record the songs, they felt that their chosen songs would come together if they could \"find a studio which would approximate the vibe of Rock Island in the sense of a relaxed but focused mood and its remoteness from the music industry mainland.\" They found a big-porched southern house in Athens, Georgia that fit their needs. The Junkies moved into the rented home in the suburbs of Athens in June 1995. The producer and engineer John Keane had built a homey but state-of-the-art studio, and the band settled in quickly.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index3.html|title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Lay It Down {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkie's last album of the decade is an [[alternative country]] album, ''[[Miles from Our Home]]''. Wanting to repeat the process of writing and creating used for ''[[Lay It Down (Cowboy Junkies album)|Lay It Down]]'', Michael Timmins found a house near a grist mill on a pond, a couple hours drive from Toronto, where he spent six months writing songs. During that time, Margo and Peter Timmins and Alan Anton would come down to work on songs. Then Michael wrote more, until the songs were worked out and ready to record.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/index2.html |title=Miles From Our Home {{!}} Page 2 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan}}</ref> On New Year's Day in 1997, just as Timmins was planning the album, the band heard that [[Townes Van Zandt]] had died. Van Zandt was a friend of the band, had toured with them in their bus in 1990, and was perhaps the biggest influence as a songwriter on Michael. On the day that Michael Timmins had heard that Van Zandt had died he wrote the first draft of \"Blue Guitar\", \"as a tribute to the man who had the bluest guitar that I had ever heard.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/ |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Miles From Our Home |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 2000s ===\nThroughout their career, Cowboy Junkies have approached each album to see where they can change or improve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |title=The Cowboy Junkies: The Way They Groove Together {{!}} Music Express |website=Junkies Fan |date=March 1992 |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |author=Finlay, Liza}}</ref> ''[[Open (Cowboy Junkies album)|Open]]'', which was released on May 15, 2001,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r530810/review |title=Open - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref> follows in that tradition. While they were on a tour to support their live album ''[[Waltz Across America]]'', which lasted nine months and had many breaks in the schedule, they began working on new material. They added two to three new songs a month into their performances, allowing the songs to evolve on stage. During breaks, they would go to sound engineer Daryl Smith's studio, Chemical Sound, to live record material they had created.  Being able to set up in a couple hours, record some tracks, and be done by the end of the day was a departure from their habit of trying to complete an album's worth of songs in a set recording period. On each visit, they would record two or three songs. They also took the opportunity to re-record songs. After the band had recorded fifteen tracks, they listened and decided they had the songs they needed, with two additional songs recorded at [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]]'s home studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/open/open_index.htm |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Open |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan}}</ref>\n\n''[[One Soul Now]]'' was recorded over the course of a year, from October 2002 to October 2003. Its central idea is that everyone is interconnected. When the band returned home after their Open Tour, they decided to turn their rehearsal area into a recording studio which they dubbed, The Clubhouse. This new arrangement changed the process of how they created their tracks. Previously, they would start in the rehearsal space, determine how the songs would work, then go to a studio. Now, the band recorded everything as they worked through the rehearsal process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/onesoulnow/osn_album.swf |title=Cowboy Junkies One Soul Now |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies next project was ''[[Early 21st Century Blues]]'', which was recorded February through March 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r787136 |title=Early 21st Century Blues - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref> It was begun a few months after their previous tour. The theme for the album was war, violence, fear, greed, ignorance, or loss, and everybody had to bring two or three songs written by other people.

Michael Timmins wrote songs that \"reflect the complex, frustrating, edifying, and conflict-ridden web of relationships that constitute the family, from nuclear to extended to global. He is a parent, and a son with aging parents. He plays with his siblings in the Cowboy Junkies.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/at-the-end-of-paths-taken-mw0000479835|title=At the End of Paths Taken - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |author=Jurek, Thom}}</ref> Timmins blends his alternative country music sound with ferocious guitar work on \"My Little Basquiat\" and \"Mountain\u2033.

In order to expand upon the goal of reinterpreting, the Cowboy Junkies invited three guest musicians whose work has affected the Cowboy Junkies, and whose work and lives were affected by the album. Guest musicians on the 2007 album include [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Vic Chesnutt]], and [[Ryan Adams]]. Each does lead vocal on one of the album's songs (Merchant on \"To Love Is to Bury\", Chesnutt on \"Postcard Blues\", and Adams on \"200 More Miles\"). They also perform on other tracks. Jeff Bird, a session musician who has appeared on virtually every Cowboy Junkies album, is also included in the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinity/main_content.html |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Trinity Revisited |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref> In order to create the same atmosphere, they kept rehearsal to a minimum, getting together for a few hours a day before the recording. The guest musicians worked with the band to re-imagine the songs, making suggestions, trying out fresh nuances. The album contains a performance film, ''[[Trinity Revisited]]'', and a documentary film, ''Trinity Session Revisited''. Directors Pierre and Fran\u00e7ois Lamoureux, produced and recorded the album and the films. Although the album was not recorded with a single microphone like the original album, the directors placed the musicians in a circle and used a surround microphone, augmented the recording with ten close-mics to record them.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mixonline.com/recording/cowboy-junkies-go-back-church-365949 |title=Cowboy Junkies Go Back to Church |work=Mix |date=February 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |author=Jackson, Blair}}</ref>\n\n=== 2010s ===\n''[[The Nomad Series]]'' is a set of four albums that was released over three years from 2010 to 2012.

Most of their time was spent in Jingjiang, situated on the [[Yangtze]] River about two hours' drive from [[Shanghai]].<ref name=\"Renmin Park\">{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/renmin/renmin_park.html |title=Renmin Park |website=Latent Recordings |date=March 2010 |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael}}</ref>  The music that inspired Timmins most during the visit was found at Renmin Park, where a variety musicians would gather throughout the day, bringing their erhus, pipas, shangxians, various percussion instruments; and a mix of singers performed. Timmins found most of the musicians outstanding, he thought the singers were good because they all performed with passion. About halfway through the visit, Timmins was introduced to Eric Chen, who was passionate about music, and became Timmins' friend. Chen brought Timmins a variety of CDs and videos that showcased the Chinese rock scene.<ref name=\"Renmin Park\"/>\n\nMichael asked his brother, Peter Timmins, to send him a high-end portable recorder, which he carried everywhere he went, and recorded music, conversations, exercise classes, badminton games, traffic, students chatter in classrooms, street hawkers, and more. He sent the recordings to Joby Baker in British Columbia with instructions to create loops of the sounds, and to use his imagination. The core of the album is built around a fictional love story between two people who live in different worlds that always keep them apart. ''Renmin Park'' is also a thank-you letter to the people of the city that so kindly welcomed him and his family.<ref name=\"Renmin Park\"/>\n\nOn December 25, 2009, at the age of 45, Cowboy Junkies friend, [[Vic Chesnutt]], died from an overdose of muscle relaxants.

As Cowboy Junkies pass the quarter century mark, the Toronto band must rest well at night. The band's consistent work flies under the radar more times than not and the band sounds content with keeping it that way.\" He continues, \"One of the band's live staples in recent years is \"Hunted\" from 1994's ''Pale Sun Crescent Moon''. Revisiting the song here, the original sounds frail and timid in comparison. Margo belts out the lyrics with the dry bitterness of someone who has witnessed first-hand the arrows that fly between men and women.

John Timmins was initially a member of the band but left the group before the recording of their first album.<ref name=\"86 Promo sheet\"/> The band line-up has never changed since, although they use several guest musicians on many of their albums, including multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bird who has performed on every album except the first.\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies' 1986 debut album, produced by Canadian producer [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], was the [[blues]]-inspired ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'', recorded in the family garage using a single [[Ambisonics|ambisonic]] microphone.<ref name=EMC/>\n\nThe band gained wide recognition with their second album, ''[[The Trinity Session]],'' recorded in 1987 at Toronto's [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]]. Their sound, again using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of [[blues]], [[country music|country]], [[American folk music|folk]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[jazz]] earned them both critical attention and a strong fan base. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' named the recording one of the 10 best albums of 1988.<ref name=EMC/>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies have gone on to record 16 studio albums and five live albums, and have remained an active band into the late 2010s.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history===\nAlan Anton and Michael Timmins, lifelong friends who met in kindergarten, formed their first band in high school. In 1979, influenced by post-punk bands such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[Joy Division]], they recruited drummer Geoff Railton and singer Liza Dawson-Whisker, and formed Hunger Project in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/whitesoff/open.html |title=Whites Off Earth Now {{!}} Backstory |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://littlevillagemag.com/prairie-pop-an-interview-with-michael-timmins-of-the-cowboy-junkies/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017152650/https://littlevillagemag.com/prairie-pop-an-interview-with-michael-timmins-of-the-cowboy-junkies/ |title=An interview with Michael Timmins of the Cowboy Junkies |work=Little Village |date=October 23, 2013 |archivedate=October 17, 2015 |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |author=McLeod, Kembrew |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-01/entertainment/ca-236_1_country-music |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029134019/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-01/entertainment/ca-236_1_country-music |title=The Cowboy Junkies' Addicting Vision : At its best, the band plays country music with a Velvet Underground twang |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 1, 1989 |archivedate=October 29, 2015 |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |author=Hilburn, Robert |url-status=live }}</ref> They moved to [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]] and performed at a variety of clubs. In early 1981, the Hunger Project embarked on a multi-city tour of the United States. After that, Hunger Project moved to the United Kingdom, where they toured for three months and released the  single \"The Same Inside/Assembly\" on their independent label, [[Latent Recordings]].<ref name=\"86 Promo sheet\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mypage.bluewin.ch:80/palesun/articles/CBJ86promo.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511211421/http://www.mypage.bluewin.ch/palesun/articles/CBJ86promo.html |title=1986 promo sheet |website=palesun's Cowboy Junkies fan pages |date=May 11, 2006 |archivedate=May 11, 2006 |accessdate=April 26, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWhen Hunger Project disbanded, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins remained in London and started an improvisational band named Germinal. The members \u2013 Michael Timmins on guitar, Alan Anton on bass, a drummer, and saxophonist, played whatever they wished on their instruments at the same time. Germinal released two LPs (''Germinal 1'' and ''Din''). The music newspaper New Musical Express said Germinal \"ranks among the most innovative and aggressive sounds to emerge from the independent scene this year.\" Alan Anton and Michael Timmins had a somewhat different take, saying, \"It was the ultimate release for us. But for the audience, it was quite a chore.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/cowboy-junkies |title=Cowboy Junkies |website=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=June 11, 2018}}</ref>  In London, they developed journeyman skills as musicians, and expanded their knowledge of music history \u2014 Michael Timmins worked in a record store for a year to make ends meet while with Germinal. Among those who were to influence Michael Timmins and Alan Anton were jazz musicians [[Cecil Taylor]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[John Coltrane]], along with the sound of early blues musicians [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Bukka White]], and [[Robert Johnson]].<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> Germinal broke up after three years in autumn of 1984. Alan Anton moved to Berlin and Michael Timmins returned to New York City.<ref name=\"86 Promo sheet\"/>\n\nUpon their return to Toronto in 1985, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins rented a house, insulated the tiny garage, and, with younger brother Pete Timmins sitting in on drums, began exploring a new musical direction. Margo was drafted to join and recalls, \"I was contemplating going on to graduate school, staying in school. That was safe. I never wanted to be a musician or be onstage.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> Nevertheless, Michael Timmins began to hear something in what they were doing with their initial jams, realizing that a female voice was what the band needed. Michael Timmins said, \"I thought if you had this female voice on top of it, you could do anything you wanted.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/>\n\nHowever, the slow musical tempos and whispery, hushed tones that defined their early work was not just musical inspiration, but came about by necessity. Their recording studio was their repurposed garage, which was just behind the house and bordered closely with their neighbours. On their first jam session, the police showed up due to a noise complaint from the neighbour.<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> According to Michael Timmins, \"We realized we had to tone down. One thing fed into the other: Margo began to realize that her singing voice was more effective quiet. We began to realize, if we can get down underneath Margo, the sound will be more effective. Pete picked up brushes \u2013 he was just learning to play drums at that point. Everything sort of came down. We learned to play with less volume.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/>\n\nWhen the unnamed band was preparing for its first gig, they members considered various names before choosing Cowboy Junkies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/8828140/Cowboy-Junkies-QandA-with-Margo-Timmins.html |title=Cowboy Junkies: Q&A with Margo Timmins |work=The Telegraph |date=October 17, 2011 |accessdate=June 11, 2018 |author=Chilton, Martin}}</ref> During their early gigs the band would perform at the Rivoli which had a small space in the back. The group would perform a rhythmic groove while Margo sang improvised vocal melodies and portions of old blues songs. Many times the Junkies entire performance would be a single jam session.<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/>\n\n[[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], a recording enthusiast who had ambitions of becoming a producer, was at their very first show. According to Moore, \"I was mesmerized by Margo. The very first show, people weren't paying attention to them, because they were playing so softly and quietly. Margo had her back to the audience a lot of the time.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\">{{cite web |url=http://nodepression.com/article/cowboy-junkies-cold-grey-light-dawn |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915115117/https://www.nodepression.com/article/cowboy-junkies-cold-grey-light-dawn |title=Cowboy Junkies - Cold grey light of dawn |work=No Depression |date=April 30, 2001 |archivedate=September 15, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2018 |author=Cantin, Paul |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nWhen the Cowboy Junkies were ready to record an album the band sought a like-minded recording engineer. They met Peter Moore at a dinner party, and when they began talking about recording equipment and techniques, they found that Moore's interest in single-microphone  recording meshed with their desire to capture the intimate sound of their rehearsal garage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.masslive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/04/cowboy_junkies_reflect_on_30_y.html |title=Cowboy Junkies reflect on 30 years before Northampton show |work=Mass Live |date=April 4, 2018 |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |author=Lenker, George}}</ref> Moore had just purchased a Calrec Ambisonic microphone at the wholesale price of $9000.<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> The Cowboy Junkies and Moore came together at the rehearsal space on June 26, 1986, and turned the garage into a recording studio. Moore arranged the group around his Calrec, jury-rigged a control room in the kitchen, and started recording.<ref name=\"Sound on Sound\">{{cite web |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/cowboy-junkies-sweet-jane |title=Cowboy Junkies 'Sweet Jane' |work=Sound on Sound |accessdate=April 27, 2018 |date=October 2015 |author=Doyle, Tom}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies shopped their material but were unable to find a label to distribute their work, so they revived the indie label [[Latent Recordings]] that Michael Timmins and Anton had used for their Hunger Project and Germinal works, and released ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'' in October 1986. They sold 3,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Barclay, Michael |author2=Jack, Ian A.D. |author3=Schneider, Jason |year=2001 |title=Have Not Been The Same: The Canrock Renaissance, 1985-1995 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xLIiOE_jCpAC&pg=PT528&lpg=PT528&dq=cowboy+junkies+peter+moore+1985#v=onepage&q=cowboy%20junkies%20peter%20moore%201985&f=false |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada |publisher=ECW Press|isbn=9781554909681 }}</ref> The band then toured the US. Michael Timmins described the experience: \"While touring ''Whites'' we had spent a lot of time in the Southern states, especially Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas. For some reason the club owners down there took a liking to what we were doing so we spent a lot of time crossing the kudzu choked highways that ran through the heart of the old Confederacy. Those were the days when having to spend a night in a hotel room would mean the difference between eating the next day or paying for the gas to get us to the next town, so we spent a lot of our time sleeping on the floors of friendly promoters, fans, waitresses and bartenders.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/blog/archives/4313 |title=A Look Back At\u2026.The Trinity Session (history \u2013 part 1 of 3) |website=Latent Recordings |date=November 6, 2014 |accessdate=April 4, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael}}</ref>\n\nThe band's next project, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'', became their breakthrough. Peter Moore again produced the album. They approached the project as a reaction against the MIDI\u2013dominated musical styles of the '80s. Moore said, \"I was angry that music had gotten into drum machines and MIDI. No humanity, no nothing. I'm listening to these recordings from the '50s with two or three mics and I'm going, 'Man that's real music.'\" He chose the [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]] in Toronto for its natural reverb. To better persuade the officials of the historic church, Moore claimed \"The Timmins Family Singers\" were recording a Christmas special.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinitysession/index8.html |title=Trinity Sessions {{!}} Page 8 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael}}</ref> The session began early on November 27, 1987. Songs with the fewest instruments were recorded first, and then the songs with gradually more complex arrangements. In this way Moore was able to solve acoustic problems one by one. To better balance Margo's vocals against the electric guitars and drums, she was recorded through a PA system left behind by a previous group. By making subtle changes in volume and placement relative to the microphone over six hours, Moore and the band finally reached the distinctive sound of the album.<ref name=\"Sound on Sound\"/>\n\nMusic critic for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, [[Anthony DeCurtis]], summed up the result of the group's efforts in a four-star review of the album: \"The Trinity Session is in the great tradition of albums that establish a mood and sustain it so consistently that the entire record seems like one continuously unfolding song. The mood in this instance is hypnotic and introspective \u2013 an intense, melancholic longing that blends the elemental emotions of country music and the blues with the poetic world-weariness of the Velvet Underground.\" . . . \"Having good songs, the skill to convey what they have to say and, most important, a vision, the Cowboy Junkies dispensed with high-tech trumpery and made their record simply and seriously. That attitude helped make the album as important as it is inspiring.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/rollingstone_tts.html |title=Rolling Stone Review of The Trinity Session |website=Junkies Fan |date=February 9, 1989 |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |author=DeCurtis, Anthony}}</ref>\n\nThe album was included in the book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 albums you must hear before you die |date=2006 |publisher=Universe |others=Dimery, Robert. |isbn=0789313715 |location=New York, NY |oclc=63515375}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe band's third album was more challenging, requiring three attempts to get the sound the band desired. Yet despite the problems with the making of it, the band considers it a very exciting and turbulent time in their career and state that ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' remains one of their favourite albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index2.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 2 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>  The band rented a small recording studio in the docklands of Toronto with the intention of using the room like the garage their first album was recorded in, instead of a room with live acoustics like the church room they used for ''The Trinity Session''. The session went badly because the group had just come off the road after a gruelling tour and were tired, particularly Margo Timmins who had a terrible head cold. After a few hours they realized the session wasn't working out, and they left.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index3.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe second attempt was made on April 21 of 1987 when [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]] rented the [[Sharon Temple]], an historic landmark located in the village of Sharon, Ontario. Michael Timmins recalls, \"The arrangements that we had developed for this new set of songs were at times so full and lush, unlike the spareness of most of Trinity's songs, that we were immediately confronted with the problem of how to control this swirl of sound so that it didn't just turn to mush on tape. Another problem was that the Temple was a lot more acoustically lively than any of us had imagined. As a result when the music swelled it would often spill over into Margo's vocal mic and feedback.\" At the end of three days during which the temperature would drop below freezing,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 4 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> Michael Timmins states, \"When we packed up and left Sharon that day I don't think that any of us felt that we had captured anything special. It had been a difficult three days and I think that we were all just happy that on that third day we had at least made some decent recordings of the songs if not necessarily memorable ones.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index5.html|title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 5 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> Over the next several months the band were touring and playing songs on the Sharon tape. As the band listened, new ideas for them evolved. They also wrote additional songs. Although the band truly loved recordings, the songs continued to develop on stage, and they believed the session no longer accurately represented where they were as a band.\n\nAt the end of the tour, they decided to go into Eastern Studios in downtown Toronto and reinvent how they recorded themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index6.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 6 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' sessions went quickly and smoothly, and were recorded over several days in December 1989. Michael Timmins believes: \"The beauty of the recording and one of the reasons it remains one of our favourites is that it captures the essence of the band which magically fell together during the recording of The Trinity Session and which forged its own voice, under the glare of a very intense spotlight, in the clubs and concert halls of the world.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index7.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 7 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith their next album, ''[[Black Eyed Man]]'', Michael Timmins wanted to explore music structure, specifically time shifts and tempo shifts; while Margo Timmins wanted to expand her singing style and her range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |title=The Cowboy Junkies: The Way They Groove Together {{!}} Music Express {{!}} March 1992 |website=JunkiesFan.com |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |author=Finlay, Liza}}</ref> Several musicians from previous albums showed up during the rehearsal sessions, along with about twenty five other Toronto players that were known to the band, or recruited because of their skills with instruments the band wanted to include in the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Black Eyed Man {{!}} Page 4 |website=Latent Recordings|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> Realizing he needed a theme to hold the album together what Michael Timmins decided upon was \"love found, love lost and love betrayed - it was to be the journey of the faceless, nameless and haunted Black Eyed Man.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index3.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Black Eyed Man {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe band's fifth album, ''[[Pale Sun, Crescent Moon]]'' is a song cycle about male-female relationships.

While it hasn't exactly turned into a hard-rock band (the closely drawn, highly literate, mood-conscious internal monologue remains the signature of the band's style), those aggressive opening and closing moments do signal a desire to avoid being typecast as that whispering band that found success by recording in an echoing church.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-07/entertainment/ca-43281_1_cowboy-junkies |title=A New Song and Dance for the Cowboy Junkies : Music: The group's 'Pale Sun, Crescent Moon' takes a more aggressive approach than the albums that gave the band its signature hushed sound. |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 7, 1994 |accessdate=April 27, 2018 |author=Boehm, Mike}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkie's sixth album, ''[[Lay It Down (Cowboy Junkies album)|Lay It Down]]'', was one in which the group wanted to make the music outside of Toronto and away from usual routines, so they searched for a place that was a comfortable drive away from Toronto, but would feel remote.  Alan Anton recalls, \"We found Rock Island, named not for music but for geology.  It is actually one big rock with stuff growing on it and has one small house with a great stone fireplace. We went there for a week at a time and between chopping wood, cooking, boating, whittling, hiking and staring into the fire, worked up some songs that were as laid back and sparse as the setting.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Lay It Down {{!}} Page 1 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref> When the Junkies went to record the songs, they felt that their chosen songs would come together if they could \"find a studio which would approximate the vibe of Rock Island in the sense of a relaxed but focused mood and its remoteness from the music industry mainland.\" They found a big-porched southern house in Athens, Georgia that fit their needs. The Junkies moved into the rented home in the suburbs of Athens in June 1995. The producer and engineer John Keane had built a homey but state-of-the-art studio, and the band settled in quickly.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index3.html|title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Lay It Down {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkie's last album of the decade is an [[alternative country]] album, ''[[Miles from Our Home]]''. Wanting to repeat the process of writing and creating used for ''[[Lay It Down (Cowboy Junkies album)|Lay It Down]]'', Michael Timmins found a house near a grist mill on a pond, a couple hours drive from Toronto, where he spent six months writing songs. During that time, Margo and Peter Timmins and Alan Anton would come down to work on songs. Then Michael wrote more, until the songs were worked out and ready to record.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/index2.html |title=Miles From Our Home {{!}} Page 2 |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan}}</ref> On New Year's Day in 1997, just as Timmins was planning the album, the band heard that [[Townes Van Zandt]] had died. Van Zandt was a friend of the band, had toured with them in their bus in 1990, and was perhaps the biggest influence as a songwriter on Michael. On the day that Michael Timmins had heard that Van Zandt had died he wrote the first draft of \"Blue Guitar\", \"as a tribute to the man who had the bluest guitar that I had ever heard.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/ |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Miles From Our Home |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 2000s ===\nThroughout their career, Cowboy Junkies have approached each album to see where they can change or improve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |title=The Cowboy Junkies: The Way They Groove Together {{!}} Music Express |website=Junkies Fan |date=March 1992 |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |author=Finlay, Liza}}</ref> ''[[Open (Cowboy Junkies album)|Open]]'', which was released on May 15, 2001,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r530810/review |title=Open - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref> follows in that tradition. While they were on a tour to support their live album ''[[Waltz Across America]]'', which lasted nine months and had many breaks in the schedule, they began working on new material. They added two to three new songs a month into their performances, allowing the songs to evolve on stage. During breaks, they would go to sound engineer Daryl Smith's studio, Chemical Sound, to live record material they had created.  Being able to set up in a couple hours, record some tracks, and be done by the end of the day was a departure from their habit of trying to complete an album's worth of songs in a set recording period. On each visit, they would record two or three songs. They also took the opportunity to re-record songs. After the band had recorded fifteen tracks, they listened and decided they had the songs they needed, with two additional songs recorded at [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]]'s home studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/open/open_index.htm |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Open |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan}}</ref>\n\n''[[One Soul Now]]'' was recorded over the course of a year, from October 2002 to October 2003. Its central idea is that everyone is interconnected. When the band returned home after their Open Tour, they decided to turn their rehearsal area into a recording studio which they dubbed, The Clubhouse. This new arrangement changed the process of how they created their tracks. Previously, they would start in the rehearsal space, determine how the songs would work, then go to a studio. Now, the band recorded everything as they worked through the rehearsal process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/onesoulnow/osn_album.swf |title=Cowboy Junkies One Soul Now |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies next project was ''[[Early 21st Century Blues]]'', which was recorded February through March 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r787136 |title=Early 21st Century Blues - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref> It was begun a few months after their previous tour. The theme for the album was war, violence, fear, greed, ignorance, or loss, and everybody had to bring two or three songs written by other people. This album was unique in that John Timmins recorded with his siblings, playing guitar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/21century/main_content.html |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Early 21st Century Blues |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''[[At the End of Paths Taken]]'' was released on April 9, 2007. Michael Timmins wrote songs that \"reflect the complex, frustrating, edifying, and conflict-ridden web of relationships that constitute the family, from nuclear to extended to global. He is a parent, and a son with aging parents. He plays with his siblings in the Cowboy Junkies.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/at-the-end-of-paths-taken-mw0000479835|title=At the End of Paths Taken - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |author=Jurek, Thom}}</ref> Timmins blends his alternative country music sound with ferocious guitar work on \"My Little Basquiat\" and \"Mountain\u2033. At times Timmons sounds as if he has lost control of his guitar playing, \"until you realize there's not a stray note to be found. . . .

In order to expand upon the goal of reinterpreting, the Cowboy Junkies invited three guest musicians whose work has affected the Cowboy Junkies, and whose work and lives were affected by the album. Guest musicians on the 2007 album include [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Vic Chesnutt]], and [[Ryan Adams]]. Each does lead vocal on one of the album's songs (Merchant on \"To Love Is to Bury\", Chesnutt on \"Postcard Blues\", and Adams on \"200 More Miles\"). They also perform on other tracks. Jeff Bird, a session musician who has appeared on virtually every Cowboy Junkies album, is also included in the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinity/main_content.html |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Trinity Revisited |website=Latent Recordings |accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref> In order to create the same atmosphere, they kept rehearsal to a minimum, getting together for a few hours a day before the recording. The guest musicians worked with the band to re-imagine the songs, making suggestions, trying out fresh nuances. The album contains a performance film, ''[[Trinity Revisited]]'', and a documentary film, ''Trinity Session Revisited''. Directors Pierre and Fran\u00e7ois Lamoureux, produced and recorded the album and the films. Although the album was not recorded with a single microphone like the original album, the directors placed the musicians in a circle and used a surround microphone, augmented the recording with ten close-mics to record them.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mixonline.com/recording/cowboy-junkies-go-back-church-365949 |title=Cowboy Junkies Go Back to Church |work=Mix |date=February 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |author=Jackson, Blair}}</ref>\n\n=== 2010s ===\n''[[The Nomad Series]]'' is a set of four albums that was released over three years from 2010 to 2012.

Two of his children were adopted from China, and during their stay they visited the birth village of his adopted daughters. Most of their time was spent in Jingjiang, situated on the [[Yangtze]] River about two hours' drive from [[Shanghai]].<ref name=\"Renmin Park\">{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/renmin/renmin_park.html |title=Renmin Park |website=Latent Recordings |date=March 2010 |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael}}</ref>  The music that inspired Timmins most during the visit was found at Renmin Park, where a variety musicians would gather throughout the day, bringing their erhus, pipas, shangxians, various percussion instruments; and a mix of singers performed. Timmins found most of the musicians outstanding, he thought the singers were good because they all performed with passion. About halfway through the visit, Timmins was introduced to Eric Chen, who was passionate about music, and became Timmins' friend. Chen brought Timmins a variety of CDs and videos that showcased the Chinese rock scene.<ref name=\"Renmin Park\"/>\n\nMichael asked his brother, Peter Timmins, to send him a high-end portable recorder, which he carried everywhere he went, and recorded music, conversations, exercise classes, badminton games, traffic, students chatter in classrooms, street hawkers, and more. He sent the recordings to Joby Baker in British Columbia with instructions to create loops of the sounds, and to use his imagination. The core of the album is built around a fictional love story between two people who live in different worlds that always keep them apart. ''Renmin Park'' is also a thank-you letter to the people of the city that so kindly welcomed him and his family.<ref name=\"Renmin Park\"/>\n\nOn December 25, 2009, at the age of 45, Cowboy Junkies friend, [[Vic Chesnutt]], died from an overdose of muscle relaxants.

As Cowboy Junkies pass the quarter century mark, the Toronto band must rest well at night. The band's consistent work flies under the radar more times than not and the band sounds content with keeping it that way.\" He continues, \"One of the band's live staples in recent years is \"Hunted\" from 1994's ''Pale Sun Crescent Moon''. Revisiting the song here, the original sounds frail and timid in comparison. Margo belts out the lyrics with the dry bitterness of someone who has witnessed first-hand the arrows that fly between men and women.
