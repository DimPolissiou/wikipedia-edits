At {{convert|8|to|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, it is Australia's smallest bird. It was originally described by [[John Gould]] in 1838, and four subspecies are recognised. The weebill's plumage is nondescript, with olive-grey upperparts and paler, more yellowish underparts. It grades from more brownish plumage in the southern regions of Australia to more yellow in tropical areas.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe weebill was described by John Gould in 1838 as ''Psilopus brevirostris''.

Since 1999, he formally embraced a branch of the [[Old Believers]], a Russian religious movement which rejected the 1652\u20131666 [[Old Believers#Reforms of Patriarch Nikon|reforms]] of the official [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}} Dugin's Eurasian philosophy owes much to [[Traditionalist School|Traditional Integralism]] and ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' movements, and as such it resonates with [[Neopaganism]],{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|pp=11\u201314}} a category which in this context means the movement of [[Slavic Native Faith]] (Rodnovery), especially in the forms of [[Anastasianism]] and [[Ynglism]]. Dugin's Eurasianism is often cited as belonging to the same spectrum of these movements,<ref>[[Marat Shterin]] (2016). \"[https://g2w.eu/zeitschrift/leseprobe/1250-attraktivitaet-und-dilemma-neue-religioese-bewegungen-in-russland Attraktivit\u00e4t und Dilemma: Neue religi\u00f6se Bewegungen in Russland]\".

''The Fourth Political Theory''. Arktos, 2012. p. 210.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Marlene Laruelle]], Dugin's adherence to the Old Believers allows him to stand between Paganism and Orthodox Christianity without formally adopting either of them. His choice is not paradoxical, since, according to him\u2014in the wake of [[Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non]]\u2014Russian Orthodoxy and especially the Old Believers have preserved an [[esotericism|esoteric]] and initiatory character which was utterly lost in Western Christianity. As such, the Russian Orthodox tradition may be merged with [[Modern Paganism|Neopaganism]] and may host \"Neopaganism's nationalist force, which anchors it in the Russian soil, and separates it from the two other Christian confessions\".{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}}\n\n===Esotericism, fascism, and integrative geopolitics===\n\nIn the early 1990s Dugin's work at the [[National Bolshevik Front]] included research into the roots of national movements and the activities of [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria|supporting esoteric groups]] in the first half of the 20th century.

Since 1999, he formally embraced a branch of the [[Old Believers]], a Russian religious movement which rejected the 1652\u20131666 [[Old Believers#Reforms of Patriarch Nikon|reforms]] of the official [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}} Dugin's Eurasian philosophy owes much to [[Traditionalist School|Traditional Integralism]] and ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' movements, and as such it resonates with [[Neopaganism]],{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|pp=11\u201314}} a category which in this context means the movement of [[Slavic Native Faith]] (Rodnovery), especially in the forms of [[Anastasianism]] and [[Ynglism]]. Dugin's Eurasianism is often cited as belonging to the same spectrum of these movements,<ref>[[Marat Shterin]] (2016). \"[https://g2w.eu/zeitschrift/leseprobe/1250-attraktivitaet-und-dilemma-neue-religioese-bewegungen-in-russland Attraktivit\u00e4t und Dilemma: Neue religi\u00f6se Bewegungen in Russland]\".

''The Fourth Political Theory''. Arktos, 2012. p. 210.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Marlene Laruelle]], Dugin's adherence to the Old Believers allows him to stand between Paganism and Orthodox Christianity without formally adopting either of them. His choice is not paradoxical, since, according to him\u2014in the wake of [[Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non]]\u2014Russian Orthodoxy and especially the Old Believers have preserved an [[esotericism|esoteric]] and initiatory character which was utterly lost in Western Christianity. As such, the Russian Orthodox tradition may be merged with [[Modern Paganism|Neopaganism]] and may host \"Neopaganism's nationalist force, which anchors it in the Russian soil, and separates it from the two other Christian confessions\".{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}}\n\n===Esotericism, fascism, and integrative geopolitics===\n\nIn the early 1990s Dugin's work at the [[National Bolshevik Front]] included research into the roots of national movements and the activities of [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria|supporting esoteric groups]] in the first half of the 20th century.

{"title_page": "Consent of the governed", "text_new": " refers to the idea that a [[government]]'s [[political legitimacy|legitimacy]] and [[natural and legal rights|moral right]] to use state power is only justified and lawful when consented to by the people  or [[society]] over which that [[political power]] is exercised. This theory of [[consent]] is historically contrasted to the [[divine right of kings]] and had often been invoked against the legitimacy of [[colonialism]]. Article 21 of the United Nations' 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that \"The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government\".\n\n==Types of consent==\n\n===Unanimous consent===\nA key question is whether the [[unanimous consent]] of the governed is required; if so, this would imply the [[right of secession]] for those who do not want to be governed by a particular collective. All democratic governments today allow decisions to be made even over the dissent of a minority of voters, which in some theorists' view, calls into question whether said governments can rightfully claim, in all circumstances, to act with the consent of the governed.<ref name=\"Cassinelli\">{{cite journal|last1=Cassinelli|first1=C. W.|year=1959|title=The 'Consent' of the Governed|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=12|issue=2|pages=391\u2013409|doi=10.1177/106591295901200202}}</ref>\n\n===Hypothetical consent===\nThe theory of hypothetical consent of the governed holds that one's obligation to obey government depends on whether the government is such that one ''ought'' to consent to it, or whether the people, if placed in a [[state of nature]] without government, would agree to said government.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pitkin|first1=Hanna|year=1966|title=Obligation and Consent\u2014II|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=60|issue=1|pages=39\u201352|doi=10.2307/1953805|jstor=1953805}}</ref> This theory has been rejected by some scholars{{Who|date=May 2015}}, who argue that since government itself can commit aggression, creating a government to safeguard the people from aggression would be similar to the people, if given the choice of what animals to be attacked by, trading \"[[weasel|polecats]] and foxes for a lion\", a trade that they would not make.<ref name=\"Bookman\">{{cite journal|last1=Bookman|first1=John T.|year=1984|title=Locke's Contract: Would People consent to It?|journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology|volume=43|issue=3|pages=357\u201368|doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.1984.tb01750.x}}</ref>\n\n===Overt versus tacit consent===\n\nAnother division that is sometimes made is between [[overt consent]] and [[tacit consent]]. Overt consent, to be valid, would require [[voluntariness]], a specific act on the part of the consenters, a particular act consented to, and specific agents who perform this action. [[Immigrating]] into a particular jurisdiction is sometimes regarded as an overt act indicating consent to be ruled by that jurisdiction's government. Not all who are ruled by a particular government have immigrated to that jurisdiction, however; some were born there; however others argue that the power to emigrate from (i.e. leave) a jurisdiction ''implies'' such consent omission.\n\n===Engineered consent===\n\nAccording to the propagandist [[Edward L. Bernays]]  [[public relations|when describing public relations]] techniques that were described in his essay and book ''[[The Engineering of Consent]]'' (1955), the public may be manipulated by its subconscious desires to render votes to a political candidate.  Consent thus obtained undermines the legitimacy of government. Bernays claimed that \"the basic principle involved is simple but important: If the opinions of the public are to control the government, these opinions must not be controlled by the government.\"<ref>John C. Livingston & Robert G. Thompson (1966) ''The Consent of the Governed'', 2nd edition, page 457, [[Collier Macmillan]]</ref>\n\n[[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] in their book, ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'' (1988), advanced a [[propaganda model]] for the [[news media in the United States]]<ref>[[Edward S. Herman]] & [[Noam Chomsky]] (1988) [[Manufacturing Consent]], [[Pantheon Books]]</ref> in which coverage of [[current events]] was skewed by [[corporations]] and the [[state (polity)|state]] in order to manufacture the consent of the governed.\n\n===Literal consent===\nThe theory of literal consent holds the logical position that valid consent must denote final authority belonging to the people, rather than elected officials, therefore this implies that the people have the absolute sovereign power to overrule their government at any time via popular vote (or as stated in the Declaration of Independence, \"the right of the People to alter or abolish\" their government). Without this unfettered power, theorists hold that true consent cannot exist and that any government is therefore despotism via governing the people by force without their actual consent.\n\n==History==\nIn his 1937 book ''[[A History of Political Theory]]'', [[George Sabine]] collected the views of many political theorists on consent of the governed. He notes the idea mentioned in 1433 by [[Nicholas of Cusa]] in ''De Concordantia Catholica''. In 1579 [[Theodore Beza]] wrote ''Vindiciae contra Tyrannos'' which Sabine paraphrases: \"The people lay down the conditions which the king is bound to fulfill. Hence they are bound to obedience only conditionally, namely, upon receiving the protection of just and lawful government\u2026the power of the ruler is delegated by the people and continues only with their consent.\"<ref name=Sabine>George Sabine (1937) A History of Political Theory, [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]</ref>{{rp|381}} In England, the [[Levellers]] also held to this principle of government.\n\n[[John Milton]] wrote\n{{quote|The power of kings and magistrates is nothing else, but what is only derivative, transferred and committed to them in trust from the people, to the common good of them all, in whom the power yet remains fundamentally, and cannot be taken from them, without a violation of their natural birthright.<ref name=Sabine/>{{rp|510}}<ref>John Milton ''Works'' V: 10</ref>}}\n\nSimilarly, Sabine notes the position of [[John Locke]] in ''Essay concerning Human Understanding'': \n{{quote|[Civic power] can have no right except as this is derived from the individual right of each man to protect himself and his property. The legislative and executive power used by government to protect property is nothing except the natural power of each man resigned into the hands  of the community\u2026and it is justified merely because it is a better way of protecting natural right than the self-help to which each man is naturally entitled.<ref name=Sabine/>{{rp|532}} }}\n\nHowever, with [[David Hume]] a contrary voice is heard.

This theory of [[consent]] is historically contrasted to the [[divine right of kings]] and had often been invoked against the legitimacy of [[colonialism]]. Article 21 of the United Nations' 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that \"The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government\".\n\n==Types of consent==\n\n===Unanimous consent===\nA key question is whether the [[unanimous consent]] of the governed is required; if so, this would imply the [[right of secession]] for those who do not want to be governed by a particular collective. All democratic governments today allow decisions to be made even over the dissent of a minority of voters, which in some theorists' view, calls into question whether said governments can rightfully claim, in all circumstances, to act with the consent of the governed.<ref name=\"Cassinelli\">{{cite journal|last1=Cassinelli|first1=C.

Overt consent, to be valid, would require [[voluntariness]], a specific act on the part of the consenters, a particular act consented to, and specific agents who perform this action. [[Immigrating]] into a particular jurisdiction is sometimes regarded as an overt act indicating consent to be ruled by that jurisdiction's government. Not all who are ruled by a particular government have immigrated to that jurisdiction, however; some were born there; however others argue that the power to emigrate from (i.e. leave) a jurisdiction ''implies'' such consent omission.\n\n===Engineered consent===\n\nAccording to the propagandist [[Edward L. Bernays]]  [[public relations|when describing public relations]] techniques that were described in his essay and book ''[[The Engineering of Consent]]'' (1955), the public may be manipulated by its subconscious desires to render votes to a political candidate.  Consent thus obtained undermines the legitimacy of government. Bernays claimed that \"the basic principle involved is simple but important: If the opinions of the public are to control the government, these opinions must not be controlled by the government.\"<ref>John C. Livingston & Robert G. Thompson (1966) ''The Consent of the Governed'', 2nd edition, page 457, [[Collier Macmillan]]</ref>\n\n[[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] in their book, ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'' (1988), advanced a [[propaganda model]] for the [[news media in the United States]]<ref>[[Edward S. Herman]] & [[Noam Chomsky]] (1988) [[Manufacturing Consent]], [[Pantheon Books]]</ref> in which coverage of [[current events]] was skewed by [[corporations]] and the [[state (polity)|state]] in order to manufacture the consent of the governed.\n\n===Literal consent===\nThe theory of literal consent holds the logical position that valid consent must denote final authority belonging to the people, rather than elected officials, therefore this implies that the people have the absolute sovereign power to overrule their government at any time via popular vote (or as stated in the Declaration of Independence, \"the right of the People to alter or abolish\" their government). Without this unfettered power, theorists hold that true consent cannot exist and that any government is therefore despotism via governing the people by force without their actual consent.\n\n==History==\nIn his 1937 book ''[[A History of Political Theory]]'', [[George Sabine]] collected the views of many political theorists on consent of the governed. He notes the idea mentioned in 1433 by [[Nicholas of Cusa]] in ''De Concordantia Catholica''. In 1579 [[Theodore Beza]] wrote ''Vindiciae contra Tyrannos'' which Sabine paraphrases: \"The people lay down the conditions which the king is bound to fulfill. Hence they are bound to obedience only conditionally, namely, upon receiving the protection of just and lawful government\u2026the power of the ruler is delegated by the people and continues only with their consent.\"<ref name=Sabine>George Sabine (1937) A History of Political Theory, [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]</ref>{{rp|381}} In England, the [[Levellers]] also held to this principle of government.\n\n[[John Milton]] wrote\n{{quote|The power of kings and magistrates is nothing else, but what is only derivative, transferred and committed to them in trust from the people, to the common good of them all, in whom the power yet remains fundamentally, and cannot be taken from them, without a violation of their natural birthright.<ref name=Sabine/>{{rp|510}}<ref>John Milton ''Works'' V: 10</ref>}}\n\nSimilarly, Sabine notes the position of [[John Locke]] in ''Essay concerning Human Understanding'': \n{{quote|[Civic power] can have no right except as this is derived from the individual right of each man to protect himself and his property. The legislative and executive power used by government to protect property is nothing except the natural power of each man resigned into the hands  of the community\u2026and it is justified merely because it is a better way of protecting natural right than the self-help to which each man is naturally entitled.<ref name=Sabine/>{{rp|532}} }}\n\nHowever, with [[David Hume]] a contrary voice is heard. Sabine interprets Hume's [[skepticism]] by noting\n{{quote|The political world over, absolute governments which do not even do lip-service to the fiction of consent are more common than free governments, and their subjects rarely question their right except when tyranny becomes too oppressive.<ref name=Sabine/>{{rp|603}}}}\n\nSabine revived the concept from its status as a [[political myth]] after Hume, by referring to [[Thomas Hill Green]].

Era's helicopters supported the efforts to build the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Alyeska Pipeline]] and it was during the construction of the pipeline that the company started its fixed-wing division with [[De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DeHaviland Twin Otter]] and [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair 580]] aircraft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flyravn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Media_Kit_History.pdf|title=Ravn Alaska History|access-date=November 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the construction of the pipeline, Era saw an opportunity to scheduled passenger service, which first started in May 1983.

(2003). {{Google books|cc3XzkFt-IUC|''International Law'', pp. 88\u201392.|page=88}}</ref> A treaty is an official document that expresses that agreement in words; it is also the objective outcome of a ceremonial occasion which acknowledges the parties and their defined relationships. There is no prerequisite of academic accreditation or cross-professional contextual knowledge required to publish a treaty.\n\n==Modern form==\nSince the late [[19th century]], most treaties have followed a fairly consistent format. A treaty typically begins with a [[preamble]] describing the \"High Contracting Parties\" and their shared objectives in executing the treaty, as well as summarizing any underlying events (such as the aftermath of a war in the case of a [[peace treaty]]). Modern preambles are sometimes structured as a single very long sentence formatted into multiple paragraphs for readability, in which each of the paragraphs begins with a [[gerund]] (desiring, recognizing, having, etc.).\n\nThe High Contracting Parties; referred to as either the official title of the [[head of state]] (but not including the personal name), e.g. ''His [[Majesty]] The King of X'' or ''His [[Excellency]] The President of Y'', or alternatively in the form of \"'' Government of Z''\"; are enumerated, and along with the full names and titles of their [[Plenipotentiary|plenipotentiary representatives]], and a [[boilerplate clause]] about how their representatives have communicated (or exchanged) their full powers (i.e., the official documents appointing them to act on behalf of their respective high contracting party) and found them in good or proper form. However, under the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] if the representative is the head of state, [[head of government]] or [[minister of foreign affairs]], no special document is needed, as holding such high office is sufficient.\n\nThe end of the preamble and the start of the actual agreement is often signaled by the words \"have agreed as follows\".\n\nAfter the preamble comes numbered articles, which contain the substance of the parties' actual agreement. Each article heading usually encompasses a paragraph. A long treaty may further group articles under chapter headings.\n\nModern treaties, regardless of subject matter, usually contain articles governing where the final authentic copies of the treaty will be deposited and how any subsequent disputes as to their interpretation will be peacefully resolved.\n\nThe end of a treaty, the [[eschatocol]] (or closing protocol), is often signaled by a clause like \"in witness whereof\" or \"in faith whereof\", the parties have affixed their signatures, followed by the words \"DONE at\", then the site(s) of the treaty's execution and the date(s) of its execution. The date is typically written in its most formal, non-numerical form. For example, the [[Charter of the United Nations]] was \"DONE at the city of San Francisco the twenty-sixth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five\". If the treaty is executed in multiple copies in different languages, that fact is always noted and is followed by a stipulation that the versions in different languages are equally authentic.\n\nThe signatures of the parties' representatives follow at the very end. When the text of a treaty is later reprinted, such as in a collection of treaties currently in effect, an editor will often append the dates on which the respective parties ratified the treaty and on which it came into effect for each party.\n\n==Bilateral and multilateral treaties==\n[[Bilateral treaty|Bilateral treaties]] are concluded between two states or entities.<ref name=\"nicholson135\">Nicolson, Harold. (1934). ''Diplomacy,'' p. 135.</ref> It is possible for a bilateral treaty to have more than two parties; for example, each of the bilateral treaties between [[Switzerland]] and the [[European Union]] (EU) has seventeen parties: The parties are divided into two groups, the Swiss (\"on the one part\") and the EU and its member states (\"on the other part\"). The treaty establishes rights and obligations between the Swiss and the EU and the member states severally\u2014it does not establish any rights and obligations amongst the EU and its member states.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nA [[multilateral treaty]] is concluded among several countries, establishing rights and obligations between each party and every other party.<ref name=\"nicholson135\"/> Multilateral treaties may be regional or may involve states across the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Multilateral Treaties/Agreements|website=refworld.org|date=2013|url=https://www.refworld.org/type,MULTILATERALTREATY,SAARC,,,,0.html|accessdate=2019-07-20}}</ref> Treaties of \"mutual guarantee\" are international compacts, e.g., the [[Treaty of Locarno]] which guarantees each signatory against attack from another.<ref name=\"nicholson135\"/>\n\n==Adding and amending treaty obligations==\n\n===Reservations===\n{{Main|Reservation (law)}}\nReservations are essentially [[:wiki: caveat|caveats]] to a state's acceptance of a treaty. Reservations are unilateral statements purporting to exclude or to modify the legal obligation and its effects on the reserving state.<ref>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 2 Sec. 1(d) [https://web.archive.org/web/20050208040137/http://www.un.org/law/ilc/texts/treatfra.htm Text of the Convention]</ref> These must be included at the time of signing or ratification, i.e. \"a party cannot add a reservation after it has already joined a treaty\". Article 19 of the Vienna Convention on the law of Treaties in 1969.\n\nOriginally, international law was unaccepting of treaty reservations, rejecting them unless all parties to the treaty accepted the same reservations. However, in the interest of encouraging the largest number of states to join treaties, a more permissive rule regarding reservations has emerged. While some treaties still expressly forbid any reservations, they are now generally permitted to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the goals and purposes of the treaty.\n\nWhen a state limits its treaty obligations through reservations, other states party to that treaty have the option to accept those reservations, object to them, or object and oppose them. If the state accepts them (or fails to act at all), both the reserving state and the accepting state are relieved of the reserved legal obligation as concerns their legal obligations to each other (accepting the reservation does not change the accepting state's legal obligations as concerns other parties to the treaty). If the state opposes, the parts of the treaty affected by the reservation drop out completely and no longer create any legal obligations on the reserving and accepting state, again only as concerns each other. Finally, if the state objects and opposes, there are no legal obligations under that treaty between those two state parties whatsoever. The objecting and opposing state essentially refuses to acknowledge the reserving state is a party to the treaty at all.<ref>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article II, Reservations.</ref>\n\n===Amendments===\nThere are three ways an existing treaty can be amended. First, a formal amendment requires State parties to the treaty to go through the ratification process all over again. The re-[[The_Impact_of_Religion_on_International_Negotiations|negotiation]] of treaty provisions can be long and protracted, and often some parties to the original treaty will not become parties to the amended treaty. When determining the legal obligations of states, one party to the original treaty and one party to the amended treaty, the states will only be bound by the terms they both agreed upon. Treaties can also be amended informally by the treaty executive council when the changes are only procedural, technical change in customary international law can also amend a treaty, where state behavior evinces a new interpretation of the legal obligations under the treaty. Minor corrections to a treaty may be adopted by a [[proc\u00e8s-verbal]]; but a proc\u00e8s-verbal is generally reserved for changes to rectify obvious errors in the text adopted, i.e. where the text adopted does not correctly reflect the intention of the parties adopting it.\n\n===Protocols===\n{{See also|Environmental protocol}}\nIn international law and international relations, a '''protocol''' is generally a treaty or international agreement that supplements a previous treaty or international agreement. A protocol can amend the previous treaty, or add additional provisions. Parties to the earlier agreement are not required to adopt the protocol. Sometimes this is made clearer by calling it an \"optional protocol\", especially where many parties to the first agreement do not support the protocol.\n\nSome examples: the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) established a framework for the development of binding greenhouse gas emission limits, while the [[Kyoto Protocol]] contained the specific provisions and regulations later agreed upon.\n\n== Execution and implementation ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nTreaties may be seen as 'self-executing', in that merely becoming a party puts the treaty and all of its obligations in action. Other treaties may be non-self-executing and require 'implementing legislation'\u2014a change in the domestic law of a state party that will direct or enable it to fulfill treaty obligations. An example of a treaty requiring such legislation would be one mandating local prosecution by a party for particular crimes.\n\nThe division between the two is often not clear and is often politicized in disagreements within a government over a treaty, since a non-self-executing treaty cannot be acted on without the proper change in domestic law. If a treaty requires implementing legislation, a state may be in default of its obligations by the failure of its legislature to pass the necessary domestic laws.\n\n===Interpretation===\nThe language of treaties, like that of any law or contract, must be interpreted when the wording does not seem clear or it is not immediately apparent how it should be applied in a perhaps unforeseen circumstance. The [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|Vienna Convention]] states that treaties are to be interpreted \"in good faith\" according to the \"ordinary meaning given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". International legal experts also often invoke the 'principle of maximum effectiveness,' which interprets treaty language as having the fullest force and effect possible to establish obligations between the parties.\n\nNo one party to a treaty can impose its particular interpretation of the treaty upon the other parties. Consent may be implied, however, if the other parties fail to explicitly disavow that initially unilateral interpretation, particularly if that state has acted upon its view of the treaty without complaint. Consent by all parties to the treaty to a particular interpretation has the legal effect of adding another clause to the treaty \u2013 this is commonly called an 'authentic interpretation'.\n\nInternational tribunals and arbiters are often called upon to resolve substantial disputes over treaty interpretations. To establish the meaning in context, these judicial bodies may review the preparatory work from the negotiation and drafting of the treaty as well as the final, signed treaty itself.\n\n===Consequences of terminology===\nOne significant part of treaty-making is that signing a treaty implies a recognition that the other side is a sovereign state and that the agreement being considered is enforceable under international law. Hence, nations can be very careful about terming an agreement to be a treaty. For example, within the United States, agreements between states are [[interstate compact|compacts]] and agreements between states and the federal government or between agencies of the government are [[memoranda of understanding]].\n<!--Conversely, perhaps the most significant thing about the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was that it was explicitly a treaty and hence implied British recognition of Irish sovereignty. Is this true?? The Treaty acknowledged the Irish Free State/dominion status, it seems, no more.-->\n\nAnother situation can occur when one party wishes to create an obligation under international law, but the other party does not. This factor has been at work with respect to discussions between [[North Korea]] and the [[United States]] over security guarantees and [[nuclear proliferation]].\n\nThe definition of the English word 'Treaty' varies depending on the professional context(s).\n\n==Ending treaty obligations==\n\n===Withdrawal===\nTreaties are not necessarily permanently binding upon the signatory parties. As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification. For example, the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of '''denunciations''', the number of parties falls below 40. Many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal. Article 56 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced unless:\n* it can be shown that the parties intended to admit the possibility, or\n* a right of withdrawal can be inferred from the terms of the treaty.\nThe possibility of withdrawal depends on the terms of the treaty and its ''travaux preparatory. ''It has, for example, been held that it is not possible to withdraw from the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. When North Korea declared its intention to do this the Secretary-General of the United Nations, acting as registrar, said that original signatories of the ICCPR had not overlooked the possibility of explicitly providing for withdrawal, but rather had deliberately intended not to provide for it. Consequently, withdrawal was not possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Final Clauses in Multilateral Treaties: Handbook|last = |first = |publisher = United Nations|year = 2003|isbn = 978-92-1-133572-9|location = |pages = 112|url = https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/publications/FC/English.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn practice, because of [[sovereignty]], any state can purport to withdraw from any treaty at any time, and cease to abide by its terms.  The question of whether this is lawful can be regarded as the success or failure to anticipate community acquiescence or enforcement, that is, how other states will react; for instance, another state might impose sanctions or go to war over a treaty violation.\n\nIf a state party's withdrawal is successful, its obligations under that treaty are considered terminated, and withdrawal by one party from a bilateral treaty terminates the treaty. When a state withdraws from a multilateral treaty, that treaty will still otherwise remain in force among the other parties, unless, it otherwise should or could be interpreted as agreed upon between the remaining states parties to the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Suspension and termination===\nIf a party has materially violated or breached its treaty obligations, the other parties may invoke this breach as grounds for temporarily suspending their obligations to that party under the treaty. A material breach may also be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating the treaty itself.<ref>Article 60 of the [[s: Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]].</ref>\n\nA treaty breach does not automatically suspend or terminate treaty relations, however. It depends on how the other parties regard the breach and how they resolve to respond to it. Sometimes treaties will provide for the seriousness of a breach to be determined by a tribunal or other independent arbiter.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gomaa|first1=Mohammed M.|title=Suspension or termination of treaties on grounds of breach|date=1997|publisher=M. Nijhoff|location=The Hague|isbn=9789041102263|page=142}}</ref> An advantage of such an arbiter is that it prevents a party from prematurely and perhaps wrongfully suspending or terminating its own obligations due to another's an alleged material breach.\n\nTreaties sometimes include provisions for self-termination, meaning that the treaty is automatically terminated if certain defined conditions are met. Some treaties are intended by the parties to be only temporarily binding and are set to expire on a given date. Other treaties may self-terminate if the treaty is meant to exist only under certain conditions.<ref name=\":0\">Laurence R. Helfer, Terminating Treaties, in ''The Oxford Guide to Treaties'' 634-649 (Duncan Hollis ed., Oxford University Press, 2012)</ref>\n\nA party may claim that a treaty should be terminated, even absent an express provision, if there has been a fundamental change in circumstances. Such a change is sufficient if unforeseen, if it undermined the \u201cessential basis\u201d of consent by a party if it radically transforms the extent of obligations between the parties, and if the obligations are still to be performed. A party cannot base this claim on change brought about by its own breach of the treaty. This claim also cannot be used to invalidate treaties that established or redrew political boundaries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Invalid treaties==\nThere are several reasons an otherwise valid and agreed upon treaty may be rejected as a binding international agreement, most of which involve problems created at the formation of the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} For example, the serial Japan-Korea treaties of 1905, [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907|1907]] and [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910|1910]] were protested;<ref>Korean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921\u20131922. (1922).

States are reluctant to inquire into the internal affairs and processes of other states, and so a \"manifest violation\" is required such that it would be \"objectively evident to any State dealing with the matter\". A strong presumption exists internationally that a head of state has acted within his proper authority. It seems that no treaty has ever actually been invalidated on this provision.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nConsent is also invalid if it is given by a representative who ignored restrictions he is subject to by his sovereign during the negotiations if the other parties to the treaty were notified of those restrictions prior to his signing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nAccording to the preamble in The Law of Treaties, treaties are a source of international law. If an act or lack thereof is condemned under international law, the act will not assume international legality even if approved by internal law.<ref>Article 3, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts Adopted by ILC 53 session 2001.</ref> This means that in case of a conflict with domestic law, international law will always prevail.<ref>Article 27, Vienna Convention on the Law of treaties, Vienna 23 May 1969 jfr. P 2, World T.R. 2007, 6(1), 45\u201387</ref>\n\n===Misunderstanding, fraud, corruption, coercion===\nArticles 46\u201353 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] set out the only ways that treaties can be invalidated\u2014considered unenforceable and void under international law. A treaty will be invalidated due to either the circumstances by which a state party joined the treaty or due to the content of the treaty itself. Invalidation is separate from withdrawal, suspension, or termination (addressed above), which all involve an alteration in the consent of the parties of a previously valid treaty rather than the invalidation of that consent in the first place.\n\nA governmental leader's consent may be invalidated if there was an erroneous understanding of a fact or situation at the time of conclusion, which formed the \"essential basis\" of the state's consent. Consent will not be invalidated if the misunderstanding was due to the state's own conduct, or if the truth should have been evident.\n\nConsent will also be invalidated if it was induced by the fraudulent conduct of another party, or by the direct or indirect \"corruption\" of its representative by another party to the treaty. Coercion of either a representative or the state itself through the threat or use of force, if used to obtain the consent of that state to a treaty, will invalidate that consent.\n\n===Contrary to peremptory norms===\nA treaty is null and void if it is in violation of a [[peremptory norm]]. These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations. These are limited to such universally accepted prohibitions as those against the aggressive use of force, [[genocide]] and other [[crimes against humanity]], [[piracy]], hostilities directed at civilian population, [[racial discrimination]] and [[apartheid]], [[slavery]] and [[torture]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Michael|last2=Pronto|first2=Arnold|title=The International Law Commission 1999-2009.|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199578979|page=764}}</ref> meaning that no state can legally assume an obligation to commit or permit such acts.<ref>Articles 53 and 64 of the [[s:Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]].</ref>\n\n==Role of the United Nations==\nThe [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Charter|Charter]] states that treaties must be registered with the UN to be invoked before it or enforced in its judiciary organ, the [[International Court of Justice]]. This was done to prevent the proliferation of [[secret treaty|secret treaties]] that occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries. Section 103 of the Charter also states that its members' obligations under it outweigh any competing obligations under other treaties.\n\nAfter their adoption, treaties, as well as their amendments, have to follow the official legal procedures of the United Nations, as applied by the [[United Nations Office of Legal Affairs|Office of Legal Affairs]], including [[signature]], [[ratification]] and [[entry into force]].\n\nIn function and effectiveness, the UN has been compared to the pre-Constitutional United States Federal government by some,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sobel|first=Russell S.|date=1999|title=In Defense of the Articles of Confederation and the Contribution Mechanism as a Means of Government Finance: A General Comment on the Literature|journal=Public Choice|volume=99|issue=3/4|pages=347\u2013356|issn=0048-5829|jstor=30024532|doi=10.1023/A:1018308819035}}</ref> giving a comparison between modern treaty law and the historical [[Articles of Confederation]].\n\n==Relation between national law and treaties by country==\n===Australian law===\n{{see also|List of Australian treaties|Law of Australia#International law}}\nThe [[constitution of Australia]] allows the [[Government of Australia|executive government]] to enter into treaties, but the practice is for treaties to be tabled in [[Parliament of Australia|both houses of parliament]] at least 15 days before signing. Treaties are considered a source of [[Australian law]] but sometimes require an act of parliament to be passed depending on their nature.  Treaties are administered and maintained by the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]], which advised that the \"general position under Australian law is that treaties which Australia has joined, apart from those terminating a state of war, are not directly and automatically incorporated into Australian law. Signature and ratification do not, of themselves, make treaties operate domestically. In the absence of legislation, treaties cannot impose obligations on individuals nor create rights in domestic law. Nevertheless, international law, including treaty law, is a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law and may be used in the interpretation of statutes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/treaties/treaty-making-process/pages/treaty-making-process.aspx|title=Treaty making process|website=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade}}</ref>  Treaties can be implemented by executive action, and often, existing laws are sufficient to ensure a treaty is honored.\n\nAustralian treaties generally fall under the following categories: extradition, postal agreements and money orders, trade and international conventions.\n\n===Brazilian law===\nThe federal [[constitution of Brazil]] states that the power to enter into treaties is vested in the [[president of Brazil]] and that such treaties must be approved by the [[Congress of Brazil]] (Articles 84, Clause VIII, and 49, Clause I). In practice, that has been interpreted as meaning that the executive branch is free to negotiate and sign a treaty but that its ratification by the president requires the prior approval of Congress. Additionally, the [[Supreme Federal Court]] has ruled that after ratification and entry into force, a treaty must be incorporated into domestic law by means of a presidential decree published in the federal register for it to be valid in Brazil and applicable by the Brazilian authorities.\n\nThe court has established that treaties are subject to [[judicial review|constitutional review]] and enjoy the same hierarchical position as ordinary legislation (''leis ordin\u00e1rias'', or \"ordinary laws\", in Portuguese). A more recent ruling by the [[Supreme Court of Brazil]] in 2008 has altered that somewhat by stating that treaties containing human rights provisions enjoy a status above that of ordinary legislation, subject to only the constitution itself. Additionally, the 45th Amendment to the constitution makes human rights treaties approved by Congress by a special procedure enjoy the same hierarchical position as a [[constitutional amendment]]. The hierarchical position of treaties in relation to domestic legislation is of relevance to the discussion on whether and how the latter can abrogate the former and vice versa.\n\nThe constitution does not have a [[supremacy clause]] with the same effects as the one in the [[US constitution]], which is of interest to the discussion on the relation between treaties and legislation of the [[states of Brazil]].\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], subjects are divided into three lists: union, state and concurrent. In the normal legislation process, the subjects on the union list must be legislated by the [[Parliament of India]]. For subjects on the state list, only the respective state legislature can legislate. For subjects on the concurrent list, both governments can make laws. However, to implement international treaties, Parliament can legislate on any subject and even override the general division of subject lists.\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Treaty Clause}}\nIn the United States, the term \"treaty\" has a different, more restricted legal sense than in international law. US law distinguishes what it calls \"treaties\" from \"[[executive agreements]]\", which are either \"congressional-executive agreements\" or \"sole executive agreements\". The classes are all equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only in internal US law.\n\nThe distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, but sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. Finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate before or after the treaty is signed by the President.\n\nCurrently, international agreements are ten times more likely to be executed by executive agreement. Despite the relative ease of executive agreements, the President still often chooses to pursue the formal treaty process over an executive agreement to gain congressional support on matters that require the Congress to pass implementing legislation or appropriate funds as well as for agreements that impose long-term, complex legal obligations on the US. For example, the [[Iran deal|deal by the United States, Iran, and other countries]] is not a treaty.\n\nSee the article on the [[Bricker Amendment#Legal background|Bricker Amendment]] for the history of the relationship between treaty powers and Constitutional provisions.\n\nThe [[US Supreme Court]] ruled in the [[Head Money Cases]] that \"treaties\" do not have a privileged position over Acts of Congress and can be repealed or modified, for the purposes of US law, by any subsequent Act of Congress, just like any other regular law. The court also ruled in ''[[Reid v. Covert]]'' that treaty provisions that conflict with the US Constitution are null and void under US law.\n\n==Treaties and indigenous peoples==\nTreaties formed an important part of [[Europe]]an [[colonization]] and, in many parts of the world, Europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with [[indigenous people]]s. In most cases, these treaties were in extremely disadvantageous terms to the native people, who often did not appreciate the implications of what they were signing.\n\nIn some rare cases, such as with [[Ethiopia]] and [[Qing Dynasty]] [[China]], the local governments were able to use the treaties to at least mitigate the impact of European colonization. This involved learning the intricacies of European diplomatic customs and then using the treaties to prevent power from overstepping their agreement or by playing different powers against each other.\n\nIn other cases, such as [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]], treaties allowed native peoples to maintain a minimum amount of autonomy. In the case of indigenous [[Australians]], unlike with the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] of New Zealand, no treaty was ever entered into with the indigenous peoples entitling the Europeans to land ownership, under the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' (later overturned by ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)|Mabo v Queensland]]'', establishing the concept of [[native title]] well after colonization was already a ''fait accompli''). Such treaties between colonizers and indigenous peoples are an important part of political discourse in the late 20th and early 21st century, the treaties being discussed have international standing as has been stated in a treaty study by the UN.\n\nPrior to 1871, the government of the United States regularly entered into treaties with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] but the [[Indian Appropriations Act]] of March 3, 1871 (ch. 120, 16 Stat. 563) had a rider ({{UnitedStatesCode|25|71}}) attached that effectively ended the President's treaty-making by providing that no Indian nation or tribe shall be acknowledged as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty. The federal government continued to provide similar contractual relations with the Indian tribes after 1871 by agreements, statutes, and executive orders.<ref>Page 12 of the introduction to ''Forest Service National Resource Guide to American Indian and Alaska Native Relations'' Author: Joe Mitchell, Publish date: 12/5/97 [http://www.fs.fed.us/people/tribal/tribint.pdf US Forest Service \u2013 Caring for the land and serving people.]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bilateral treaty]]\n* [[Multilateral treaty]]\n* [[Peace treaty]]\n* [[Treaty of Friendship]]\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Foedus]]}}''\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Jus tractatuum]]}}''\n* [[List of intergovernmental organizations]]\n* [[List of treaties]]\n* [[Manrent]] (feudal [[Scottish Clan]] treaty)\n* [[Supranational union]]\n* [[Treaty ratification]]\n* [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]]\n*Governmental treaties\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Korean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921\u20131922.

(2003). {{Google books|cc3XzkFt-IUC|''International Law'', pp. 88\u201392.|page=88}}</ref> A treaty is an official document that expresses that agreement in words; it is also the objective outcome of a ceremonial occasion which acknowledges the parties and their defined relationships. There is no prerequisite of academic accreditation or cross-professional contextual knowledge required to publish a treaty.\n\n==Modern form==\nSince the late [[19th century]], most treaties have followed a fairly consistent format. A treaty typically begins with a [[preamble]] describing the \"High Contracting Parties\" and their shared objectives in executing the treaty, as well as summarizing any underlying events (such as the aftermath of a war in the case of a [[peace treaty]]). Modern preambles are sometimes structured as a single very long sentence formatted into multiple paragraphs for readability, in which each of the paragraphs begins with a [[gerund]] (desiring, recognizing, having, etc.).\n\nThe High Contracting Parties; referred to as either the official title of the [[head of state]] (but not including the personal name), e.g. ''His [[Majesty]] The King of X'' or ''His [[Excellency]] The President of Y'', or alternatively in the form of \"'' Government of Z''\"; are enumerated, and along with the full names and titles of their [[Plenipotentiary|plenipotentiary representatives]], and a [[boilerplate clause]] about how their representatives have communicated (or exchanged) their full powers (i.e., the official documents appointing them to act on behalf of their respective high contracting party) and found them in good or proper form. However, under the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] if the representative is the head of state, [[head of government]] or [[minister of foreign affairs]], no special document is needed, as holding such high office is sufficient.\n\nThe end of the preamble and the start of the actual agreement is often signaled by the words \"have agreed as follows\".\n\nAfter the preamble comes numbered articles, which contain the substance of the parties' actual agreement. Each article heading usually encompasses a paragraph. A long treaty may further group articles under chapter headings.\n\nModern treaties, regardless of subject matter, usually contain articles governing where the final authentic copies of the treaty will be deposited and how any subsequent disputes as to their interpretation will be peacefully resolved.\n\nThe end of a treaty, the [[eschatocol]] (or closing protocol), is often signaled by a clause like \"in witness whereof\" or \"in faith whereof\", the parties have affixed their signatures, followed by the words \"DONE at\", then the site(s) of the treaty's execution and the date(s) of its execution. The date is typically written in its most formal, non-numerical form. For example, the [[Charter of the United Nations]] was \"DONE at the city of San Francisco the twenty-sixth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five\". If the treaty is executed in multiple copies in different languages, that fact is always noted and is followed by a stipulation that the versions in different languages are equally authentic.\n\nThe signatures of the parties' representatives follow at the very end. When the text of a treaty is later reprinted, such as in a collection of treaties currently in effect, an editor will often append the dates on which the respective parties ratified the treaty and on which it came into effect for each party.\n\n==Bilateral and multilateral treaties==\n[[Bilateral treaty|Bilateral treaties]] are concluded between two states or entities.<ref name=\"nicholson135\">Nicolson, Harold. (1934). ''Diplomacy,'' p. 135.</ref> It is possible for a bilateral treaty to have more than two parties; for example, each of the bilateral treaties between [[Switzerland]] and the [[European Union]] (EU) has seventeen parties: The parties are divided into two groups, the Swiss (\"on the one part\") and the EU and its member states (\"on the other part\"). The treaty establishes rights and obligations between the Swiss and the EU and the member states severally\u2014it does not establish any rights and obligations amongst the EU and its member states.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nA [[multilateral treaty]] is concluded among several countries, establishing rights and obligations between each party and every other party.<ref name=\"nicholson135\"/> Multilateral treaties may be regional or may involve states across the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Multilateral Treaties/Agreements|website=refworld.org|date=2013|url=https://www.refworld.org/type,MULTILATERALTREATY,SAARC,,,,0.html|accessdate=2019-07-20}}</ref> Treaties of \"mutual guarantee\" are international compacts, e.g., the [[Treaty of Locarno]] which guarantees each signatory against attack from another.<ref name=\"nicholson135\"/>\n\n==Adding and amending treaty obligations==\n\n===Reservations===\n{{Main|Reservation (law)}}\nReservations are essentially [[:wiki: caveat|caveats]] to a state's acceptance of a treaty. Reservations are unilateral statements purporting to exclude or to modify the legal obligation and its effects on the reserving state.<ref>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 2 Sec. 1(d) [https://web.archive.org/web/20050208040137/http://www.un.org/law/ilc/texts/treatfra.htm Text of the Convention]</ref> These must be included at the time of signing or ratification, i.e. \"a party cannot add a reservation after it has already joined a treaty\". Article 19 of the Vienna Convention on the law of Treaties in 1969.\n\nOriginally, international law was unaccepting of treaty reservations, rejecting them unless all parties to the treaty accepted the same reservations. However, in the interest of encouraging the largest number of states to join treaties, a more permissive rule regarding reservations has emerged. While some treaties still expressly forbid any reservations, they are now generally permitted to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the goals and purposes of the treaty.\n\nWhen a state limits its treaty obligations through reservations, other states party to that treaty have the option to accept those reservations, object to them, or object and oppose them. If the state accepts them (or fails to act at all), both the reserving state and the accepting state are relieved of the reserved legal obligation as concerns their legal obligations to each other (accepting the reservation does not change the accepting state's legal obligations as concerns other parties to the treaty). If the state opposes, the parts of the treaty affected by the reservation drop out completely and no longer create any legal obligations on the reserving and accepting state, again only as concerns each other. Finally, if the state objects and opposes, there are no legal obligations under that treaty between those two state parties whatsoever. The objecting and opposing state essentially refuses to acknowledge the reserving state is a party to the treaty at all.<ref>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article II, Reservations.</ref>\n\n===Amendments===\nThere are three ways an existing treaty can be amended. First, a formal amendment requires State parties to the treaty to go through the ratification process all over again. The re-[[The_Impact_of_Religion_on_International_Negotiations|negotiation]] of treaty provisions can be long and protracted, and often some parties to the original treaty will not become parties to the amended treaty. When determining the legal obligations of states, one party to the original treaty and one party to the amended treaty, the states will only be bound by the terms they both agreed upon. Treaties can also be amended informally by the treaty executive council when the changes are only procedural, technical change in customary international law can also amend a treaty, where state behavior evinces a new interpretation of the legal obligations under the treaty. Minor corrections to a treaty may be adopted by a [[proc\u00e8s-verbal]]; but a proc\u00e8s-verbal is generally reserved for changes to rectify obvious errors in the text adopted, i.e. where the text adopted does not correctly reflect the intention of the parties adopting it.\n\n===Protocols===\n{{See also|Environmental protocol}}\nIn international law and international relations, a '''protocol''' is generally a treaty or international agreement that supplements a previous treaty or international agreement. A protocol can amend the previous treaty, or add additional provisions. Parties to the earlier agreement are not required to adopt the protocol. Sometimes this is made clearer by calling it an \"optional protocol\", especially where many parties to the first agreement do not support the protocol.\n\nSome examples: the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) established a framework for the development of binding greenhouse gas emission limits, while the [[Kyoto Protocol]] contained the specific provisions and regulations later agreed upon.\n\n== Execution and implementation ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nTreaties may be seen as 'self-executing', in that merely becoming a party puts the treaty and all of its obligations in action. Other treaties may be non-self-executing and require 'implementing legislation'\u2014a change in the domestic law of a state party that will direct or enable it to fulfill treaty obligations. An example of a treaty requiring such legislation would be one mandating local prosecution by a party for particular crimes.\n\nThe division between the two is often not clear and is often politicized in disagreements within a government over a treaty, since a non-self-executing treaty cannot be acted on without the proper change in domestic law. If a treaty requires implementing legislation, a state may be in default of its obligations by the failure of its legislature to pass the necessary domestic laws.\n\n===Interpretation===\nThe language of treaties, like that of any law or contract, must be interpreted when the wording does not seem clear or it is not immediately apparent how it should be applied in a perhaps unforeseen circumstance. The [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|Vienna Convention]] states that treaties are to be interpreted \"in good faith\" according to the \"ordinary meaning given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". International legal experts also often invoke the 'principle of maximum effectiveness,' which interprets treaty language as having the fullest force and effect possible to establish obligations between the parties.\n\nNo one party to a treaty can impose its particular interpretation of the treaty upon the other parties. Consent may be implied, however, if the other parties fail to explicitly disavow that initially unilateral interpretation, particularly if that state has acted upon its view of the treaty without complaint. Consent by all parties to the treaty to a particular interpretation has the legal effect of adding another clause to the treaty \u2013 this is commonly called an 'authentic interpretation'.\n\nInternational tribunals and arbiters are often called upon to resolve substantial disputes over treaty interpretations. To establish the meaning in context, these judicial bodies may review the preparatory work from the negotiation and drafting of the treaty as well as the final, signed treaty itself.\n\n===Consequences of terminology===\nOne significant part of treaty-making is that signing a treaty implies a recognition that the other side is a sovereign state and that the agreement being considered is enforceable under international law. Hence, nations can be very careful about terming an agreement to be a treaty. For example, within the United States, agreements between states are [[interstate compact|compacts]] and agreements between states and the federal government or between agencies of the government are [[memoranda of understanding]].\n<!--Conversely, perhaps the most significant thing about the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was that it was explicitly a treaty and hence implied British recognition of Irish sovereignty. Is this true?? The Treaty acknowledged the Irish Free State/dominion status, it seems, no more.-->\n\nAnother situation can occur when one party wishes to create an obligation under international law, but the other party does not. This factor has been at work with respect to discussions between [[North Korea]] and the [[United States]] over security guarantees and [[nuclear proliferation]].\n\nThe definition of the English word 'Treaty' varies depending on the professional context(s).\n\n==Ending treaty obligations==\n\n===Withdrawal===\nTreaties are not necessarily permanently binding upon the signatory parties. As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification. For example, the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of '''denunciations''', the number of parties falls below 40. Many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal. Article 56 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced unless:\n* it can be shown that the parties intended to admit the possibility, or\n* a right of withdrawal can be inferred from the terms of the treaty.\nThe possibility of withdrawal depends on the terms of the treaty and its ''travaux preparatory. ''It has, for example, been held that it is not possible to withdraw from the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. When North Korea declared its intention to do this the Secretary-General of the United Nations, acting as registrar, said that original signatories of the ICCPR had not overlooked the possibility of explicitly providing for withdrawal, but rather had deliberately intended not to provide for it. Consequently, withdrawal was not possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Final Clauses in Multilateral Treaties: Handbook|last = |first = |publisher = United Nations|year = 2003|isbn = 978-92-1-133572-9|location = |pages = 112|url = https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/publications/FC/English.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn practice, because of [[sovereignty]], any state can purport to withdraw from any treaty at any time, and cease to abide by its terms.  The question of whether this is lawful can be regarded as the success or failure to anticipate community acquiescence or enforcement, that is, how other states will react; for instance, another state might impose sanctions or go to war over a treaty violation.\n\nIf a state party's withdrawal is successful, its obligations under that treaty are considered terminated, and withdrawal by one party from a bilateral treaty terminates the treaty. When a state withdraws from a multilateral treaty, that treaty will still otherwise remain in force among the other parties, unless, it otherwise should or could be interpreted as agreed upon between the remaining states parties to the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Suspension and termination===\nIf a party has materially violated or breached its treaty obligations, the other parties may invoke this breach as grounds for temporarily suspending their obligations to that party under the treaty. A material breach may also be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating the treaty itself.<ref>Article 60 of the [[s: Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]].</ref>\n\nA treaty breach does not automatically suspend or terminate treaty relations, however. It depends on how the other parties regard the breach and how they resolve to respond to it. Sometimes treaties will provide for the seriousness of a breach to be determined by a tribunal or other independent arbiter.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gomaa|first1=Mohammed M.|title=Suspension or termination of treaties on grounds of breach|date=1997|publisher=M. Nijhoff|location=The Hague|isbn=9789041102263|page=142}}</ref> An advantage of such an arbiter is that it prevents a party from prematurely and perhaps wrongfully suspending or terminating its own obligations due to another's an alleged material breach.\n\nTreaties sometimes include provisions for self-termination, meaning that the treaty is automatically terminated if certain defined conditions are met. Some treaties are intended by the parties to be only temporarily binding and are set to expire on a given date. Other treaties may self-terminate if the treaty is meant to exist only under certain conditions.<ref name=\":0\">Laurence R. Helfer, Terminating Treaties, in ''The Oxford Guide to Treaties'' 634-649 (Duncan Hollis ed., Oxford University Press, 2012)</ref>\n\nA party may claim that a treaty should be terminated, even absent an express provision, if there has been a fundamental change in circumstances. Such a change is sufficient if unforeseen, if it undermined the \u201cessential basis\u201d of consent by a party if it radically transforms the extent of obligations between the parties, and if the obligations are still to be performed. A party cannot base this claim on change brought about by its own breach of the treaty. This claim also cannot be used to invalidate treaties that established or redrew political boundaries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Invalid treaties==\nThere are several reasons an otherwise valid and agreed upon treaty may be rejected as a binding international agreement, most of which involve problems created at the formation of the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} For example, the serial Japan-Korea treaties of 1905, [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907|1907]] and [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910|1910]] were protested;<ref>Korean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921\u20131922. (1922). ''Korea's Appeal to the Conference on Limitation of Armament,'' pp. 1\u201344.</ref> and they were confirmed as \"already [[null and void]]\" in the 1965 [[Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea]].<ref>[[s: Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea|\" Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea\"]]; excerpt, \"It is confirmed that all treaties or agreements concluded between the Empire of Japan and the Empire of Korea on or before August 22, 1910, are already null and void.\"</ref>\n\n===''Ultra vires'' treaties===\nA party's consent to a treaty is invalid if it had been given by an agent or body without power to do so under that state's [[domestic laws]]. States are reluctant to inquire into the internal affairs and processes of other states, and so a \"manifest violation\" is required such that it would be \"objectively evident to any State dealing with the matter\". A strong presumption exists internationally that a head of state has acted within his proper authority. It seems that no treaty has ever actually been invalidated on this provision.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nConsent is also invalid if it is given by a representative who ignored restrictions he is subject to by his sovereign during the negotiations if the other parties to the treaty were notified of those restrictions prior to his signing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nAccording to the preamble in The Law of Treaties, treaties are a source of international law. If an act or lack thereof is condemned under international law, the act will not assume international legality even if approved by internal law.<ref>Article 3, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts Adopted by ILC 53 session 2001.</ref> This means that in case of a conflict with domestic law, international law will always prevail.<ref>Article 27, Vienna Convention on the Law of treaties, Vienna 23 May 1969 jfr. P 2, World T.R. 2007, 6(1), 45\u201387</ref>\n\n===Misunderstanding, fraud, corruption, coercion===\nArticles 46\u201353 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] set out the only ways that treaties can be invalidated\u2014considered unenforceable and void under international law. A treaty will be invalidated due to either the circumstances by which a state party joined the treaty or due to the content of the treaty itself. Invalidation is separate from withdrawal, suspension, or termination (addressed above), which all involve an alteration in the consent of the parties of a previously valid treaty rather than the invalidation of that consent in the first place.\n\nA governmental leader's consent may be invalidated if there was an erroneous understanding of a fact or situation at the time of conclusion, which formed the \"essential basis\" of the state's consent. Consent will not be invalidated if the misunderstanding was due to the state's own conduct, or if the truth should have been evident.\n\nConsent will also be invalidated if it was induced by the fraudulent conduct of another party, or by the direct or indirect \"corruption\" of its representative by another party to the treaty. Coercion of either a representative or the state itself through the threat or use of force, if used to obtain the consent of that state to a treaty, will invalidate that consent.\n\n===Contrary to peremptory norms===\nA treaty is null and void if it is in violation of a [[peremptory norm]]. These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations. These are limited to such universally accepted prohibitions as those against the aggressive use of force, [[genocide]] and other [[crimes against humanity]], [[piracy]], hostilities directed at civilian population, [[racial discrimination]] and [[apartheid]], [[slavery]] and [[torture]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Michael|last2=Pronto|first2=Arnold|title=The International Law Commission 1999-2009.|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199578979|page=764}}</ref> meaning that no state can legally assume an obligation to commit or permit such acts.<ref>Articles 53 and 64 of the [[s:Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]].</ref>\n\n==Role of the United Nations==\nThe [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Charter|Charter]] states that treaties must be registered with the UN to be invoked before it or enforced in its judiciary organ, the [[International Court of Justice]]. This was done to prevent the proliferation of [[secret treaty|secret treaties]] that occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries. Section 103 of the Charter also states that its members' obligations under it outweigh any competing obligations under other treaties.\n\nAfter their adoption, treaties, as well as their amendments, have to follow the official legal procedures of the United Nations, as applied by the [[United Nations Office of Legal Affairs|Office of Legal Affairs]], including [[signature]], [[ratification]] and [[entry into force]].\n\nIn function and effectiveness, the UN has been compared to the pre-Constitutional United States Federal government by some,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sobel|first=Russell S.|date=1999|title=In Defense of the Articles of Confederation and the Contribution Mechanism as a Means of Government Finance: A General Comment on the Literature|journal=Public Choice|volume=99|issue=3/4|pages=347\u2013356|issn=0048-5829|jstor=30024532|doi=10.1023/A:1018308819035}}</ref> giving a comparison between modern treaty law and the historical [[Articles of Confederation]].\n\n==Relation between national law and treaties by country==\n===Australian law===\n{{see also|List of Australian treaties|Law of Australia#International law}}\nThe [[constitution of Australia]] allows the [[Government of Australia|executive government]] to enter into treaties, but the practice is for treaties to be tabled in [[Parliament of Australia|both houses of parliament]] at least 15 days before signing. Treaties are considered a source of [[Australian law]] but sometimes require an act of parliament to be passed depending on their nature.  Treaties are administered and maintained by the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]], which advised that the \"general position under Australian law is that treaties which Australia has joined, apart from those terminating a state of war, are not directly and automatically incorporated into Australian law. Signature and ratification do not, of themselves, make treaties operate domestically. In the absence of legislation, treaties cannot impose obligations on individuals nor create rights in domestic law. Nevertheless, international law, including treaty law, is a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law and may be used in the interpretation of statutes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/treaties/treaty-making-process/pages/treaty-making-process.aspx|title=Treaty making process|website=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade}}</ref>  Treaties can be implemented by executive action, and often, existing laws are sufficient to ensure a treaty is honored.\n\nAustralian treaties generally fall under the following categories: extradition, postal agreements and money orders, trade and international conventions.\n\n===Brazilian law===\nThe federal [[constitution of Brazil]] states that the power to enter into treaties is vested in the [[president of Brazil]] and that such treaties must be approved by the [[Congress of Brazil]] (Articles 84, Clause VIII, and 49, Clause I). In practice, that has been interpreted as meaning that the executive branch is free to negotiate and sign a treaty but that its ratification by the president requires the prior approval of Congress. Additionally, the [[Supreme Federal Court]] has ruled that after ratification and entry into force, a treaty must be incorporated into domestic law by means of a presidential decree published in the federal register for it to be valid in Brazil and applicable by the Brazilian authorities.\n\nThe court has established that treaties are subject to [[judicial review|constitutional review]] and enjoy the same hierarchical position as ordinary legislation (''leis ordin\u00e1rias'', or \"ordinary laws\", in Portuguese). A more recent ruling by the [[Supreme Court of Brazil]] in 2008 has altered that somewhat by stating that treaties containing human rights provisions enjoy a status above that of ordinary legislation, subject to only the constitution itself. Additionally, the 45th Amendment to the constitution makes human rights treaties approved by Congress by a special procedure enjoy the same hierarchical position as a [[constitutional amendment]]. The hierarchical position of treaties in relation to domestic legislation is of relevance to the discussion on whether and how the latter can abrogate the former and vice versa.\n\nThe constitution does not have a [[supremacy clause]] with the same effects as the one in the [[US constitution]], which is of interest to the discussion on the relation between treaties and legislation of the [[states of Brazil]].\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], subjects are divided into three lists: union, state and concurrent. In the normal legislation process, the subjects on the union list must be legislated by the [[Parliament of India]]. For subjects on the state list, only the respective state legislature can legislate. For subjects on the concurrent list, both governments can make laws. However, to implement international treaties, Parliament can legislate on any subject and even override the general division of subject lists.\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Treaty Clause}}\nIn the United States, the term \"treaty\" has a different, more restricted legal sense than in international law. US law distinguishes what it calls \"treaties\" from \"[[executive agreements]]\", which are either \"congressional-executive agreements\" or \"sole executive agreements\". The classes are all equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only in internal US law.\n\nThe distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, but sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. Finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate before or after the treaty is signed by the President.\n\nCurrently, international agreements are ten times more likely to be executed by executive agreement. Despite the relative ease of executive agreements, the President still often chooses to pursue the formal treaty process over an executive agreement to gain congressional support on matters that require the Congress to pass implementing legislation or appropriate funds as well as for agreements that impose long-term, complex legal obligations on the US. For example, the [[Iran deal|deal by the United States, Iran, and other countries]] is not a treaty.\n\nSee the article on the [[Bricker Amendment#Legal background|Bricker Amendment]] for the history of the relationship between treaty powers and Constitutional provisions.\n\nThe [[US Supreme Court]] ruled in the [[Head Money Cases]] that \"treaties\" do not have a privileged position over Acts of Congress and can be repealed or modified, for the purposes of US law, by any subsequent Act of Congress, just like any other regular law. The court also ruled in ''[[Reid v. Covert]]'' that treaty provisions that conflict with the US Constitution are null and void under US law.\n\n==Treaties and indigenous peoples==\nTreaties formed an important part of [[Europe]]an [[colonization]] and, in many parts of the world, Europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with [[indigenous people]]s. In most cases, these treaties were in extremely disadvantageous terms to the native people, who often did not appreciate the implications of what they were signing.\n\nIn some rare cases, such as with [[Ethiopia]] and [[Qing Dynasty]] [[China]], the local governments were able to use the treaties to at least mitigate the impact of European colonization. This involved learning the intricacies of European diplomatic customs and then using the treaties to prevent power from overstepping their agreement or by playing different powers against each other.\n\nIn other cases, such as [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]], treaties allowed native peoples to maintain a minimum amount of autonomy. In the case of indigenous [[Australians]], unlike with the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] of New Zealand, no treaty was ever entered into with the indigenous peoples entitling the Europeans to land ownership, under the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' (later overturned by ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)|Mabo v Queensland]]'', establishing the concept of [[native title]] well after colonization was already a ''fait accompli''). Such treaties between colonizers and indigenous peoples are an important part of political discourse in the late 20th and early 21st century, the treaties being discussed have international standing as has been stated in a treaty study by the UN.\n\nPrior to 1871, the government of the United States regularly entered into treaties with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] but the Indian Appropriations Act of March 3, 1871 (ch. 120, 16 Stat. 563) had a rider ({{UnitedStatesCode|25|71}}) attached that effectively ended the President's treaty-making by providing that no Indian nation or tribe shall be acknowledged as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty. The federal government continued to provide similar contractual relations with the Indian tribes after 1871 by agreements, statutes, and executive orders.<ref>Page 12 of the introduction to ''Forest Service National Resource Guide to American Indian and Alaska Native Relations'' Author: Joe Mitchell, Publish date: 12/5/97 [http://www.fs.fed.us/people/tribal/tribint.pdf US Forest Service \u2013 Caring for the land and serving people.]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bilateral treaty]]\n* [[Multilateral treaty]]\n* [[Peace treaty]]\n* [[Treaty of Friendship]]\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Foedus]]}}''\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Jus tractatuum]]}}''\n* [[List of intergovernmental organizations]]\n* [[List of treaties]]\n* [[Manrent]] (feudal [[Scottish Clan]] treaty)\n* [[Supranational union]]\n* [[Treaty ratification]]\n* [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]]\n*Governmental treaties\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Korean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921\u20131922.

After arriving in New York in 1776, Hamilton meets [[Aaron Burr]], [[John Laurens]], [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], and [[Hercules Mulligan]] (\"[[Aaron Burr, Sir]]\"), and impresses them with his rhetorical skills (\"[[My Shot]]\"). They affirm their revolutionary goals to each other (\"[[The Story of Tonight]]\"). Meanwhile, wealthy sisters [[Angelica Schuyler Church|Angelica]], [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton|Eliza]], and [[Peggy Schuyler]] go into town seeking out potential suitors (\"[[The Schuyler Sisters]]\"). [[Samuel Seabury]] warns everyone about the dangers of Congress, but Hamilton disagrees and tries to counter Seabury (\"[[Farmer Refuted]]\"). [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] then insists on his authority (\"[[You'll Be Back]]\"). During the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]], Hamilton accepts a position as [[George Washington]]'s [[aide-de-camp]] (\"[[Right Hand Man (Hamilton song)|Right Hand Man]]\"), instead of field command.\n\nAt Philip Schuyler's ball (\"A Winter's Ball\"),  Hamilton meets, falls in love with, and later marries Eliza Schuyler (\"[[Helpless (Hamilton song)|Helpless]]\"), as Angelica suppresses her feelings for the sake of their happiness at the wedding (\"[[Satisfied (Hamilton song)|Satisfied]]\"). After the wedding, Burr congratulates Hamilton on his position as aide-de-camp to Washington; Hamilton confesses that he would much rather have Burr's position on the battlefield (\"[[The Story of Tonight (Reprise)]]\"). Burr reflects on Hamilton's swift rise while considering his own career as more cautious (\"[[Wait for It (song)|Wait For It]]\").\n\nAs conditions worsen for the Continental Army, Hamilton aids Laurens in a [[duel]] against [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] (\"Stay Alive\"), who insulted Washington. Laurens injures Lee, who in turn yields (\"[[Ten Duel Commandments]]\"). Hamilton is temporarily suspended by Washington (\"Meet Me Inside\") over the duel and is sent home. There, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with her first child, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives (\"That Would Be Enough\"). After Lafayette convinces France to get involved on the colonists' side (\"Guns and Ships\"), he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final [[Siege of Yorktown]]. Washington agrees but explains to Hamilton\u2014who is convinced he should die a martyr and a hero in war\u2014that he should be careful with his actions because whatever he does will be known for ages to come (\"[[History Has Its Eyes on You]]\"). At the [[Siege of Yorktown]], Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out what to do to trap the British and win the war (\"[[Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)]]\").\n\nSoon after the victory at Yorktown, King George asks the rebels how they will succeed in governing on their own (\u201c[[What Comes Next?]]\u201d). Hamilton's son [[Philip Hamilton|Philip]] is born, while Burr has a daughter, [[Theodosia Burr Alston|Theodosia]], and the two tell their children how they will do anything to protect them (\"[[Dear Theodosia]]\"). Hamilton receives word that his friend Laurens has been killed in [[Battle of the Combahee River|a seemingly pointless battle]] after the war was won and throws himself into his work (\"[[Tomorrow There'll Be More of Us]]\"). He co-authors ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' and is selected as [[Secretary of the Treasury (United States)|Secretary of the Treasury]] by newly elected President Washington. Eliza begs Hamilton to stay. Angelica moves to London with her new husband (\"Non-Stop\").\n\n=== Act II ===\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] returns to America from being the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to France|U.S. ambassador to France]] (\"What'd I Miss\"). In 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate the latter's financial proposals at a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside, and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress (\"[[Cabinet Battle]] #1\").\n\nEliza and her family\u2014along with Angelica, back from London\u2014travel upstate during the summer, while Hamilton stays home to work on the compromise (\"Take a Break\"). Hamilton [[Hamilton\u2013Reynolds sex scandal|begins an affair]] with [[Maria Reynolds]], making him vulnerable to her husband's blackmail (\"[[Say No To This]]\"). Hamilton, Jefferson, and [[James Madison]] create the [[Compromise of 1790]] over a private dinner, exchanging Hamilton's financial plan for placing the country's permanent capital on the Potomac River. Burr is envious of Hamilton's sway in the government and wishes he had similar power (\"[[The Room Where It Happens]]\"). Burr switches political parties and defeats Philip Schuyler, making Hamilton now a rival (\"Schuyler Defeated\").\n\nIn another Cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in its [[War of the First Coalition|conflict with Britain]]. President Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument for remaining [[Proclamation of Neutrality|neutral]] (\"[[Cabinet Battle]] #2\"). In the wake of this, Jefferson, Madison, and Burr decide to join forces to find a way to discredit Hamilton in Washington's eyes (\"Washington on Your Side\"). Washington decides to retire from the presidency, and Hamilton assists in writing a [[George Washington's Farewell Address|farewell address]] (\"[[One Last Time (Hamilton)|One Last Time]]\").\n\nA flabbergasted King George receives word that George Washington has stepped down, and will be replaced by [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Paris]] signatory [[John Adams]] (\u201cI Know Him\u201d). John Adams [[1796 United States presidential election|becomes the second President]] and fires Hamilton, who publishes an inflammatory critique of the new president as a response (\"[[The Adams Administration]]\"). In the face of accusations of speculation of government funds by Jefferson, Madison, and Burr\u2014and out of fear that his affair with Maria Reynolds will be used against him in his political career (\"We Know\")\u2014Hamilton chooses to publicize his affair (\"Hurricane\") in the Reynolds Pamphlet (\"[[The Reynolds Pamphlet (song)|The Reynolds Pamphlet]]\"), damaging his relationship with Eliza. Eliza, in a heartbroken retaliation, burns all the letters Hamilton wrote her (\"Burn\"). Philip, instructed by Hamilton, challenges [[George Eacker]] to a duel and is critically injured (\"Blow Us All Away\") and dies (\"Stay Alive (Reprise)\"), causing a reconciliation between Alexander and Eliza (\"[[It's Quiet Uptown]]\").\n\nHamilton's endorsement of Jefferson in [[1800 United States presidential election|the presidential election of 1800]] (\"The Election of 1800\") results in further animosity between Hamilton and Burr, who [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|challenges Hamilton to a duel]] via an exchange of letters (\"[[Your Obedient Servant (song)|Your Obedient Servant]]\"). Hamilton writes his last letter in a rush while Eliza tells him to go back to bed (\u201cBest of Wives and Best of Women\u201d). Burr and Hamilton travel to New Jersey for the duel. During the duel, both Burr and Hamilton fire at each other after ten paces, with Hamilton intentionally missing (''[[Deloping|throwing away]]'') his shot. Hamilton dies as a result, with Eliza and Angelica at his side. Burr laments that even though he survived, he is cursed to be remembered as the villain who killed Hamilton (\"[[The World Was Wide Enough]]\"). The musical closes with a reflection on historical memory, showing how Eliza kept Hamilton's legacy alive (\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\").\n\n== Roles and principal casts ==\n=== Original production casts ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

About the origin of the song, Yankovic said, \"Lin pitched it to me as a polka medley way more hesitantly than [he] should have. He was like, 'Would you want to do a polka medley?' I was like, 'Of course I do!{{'\"}} Since Yankovic was busy working on his new tour, he wouldn't be able to release the song in February, so he suggested calling March 2 \"February 30th\".

For example, while Angelica did have a strong relationship with Hamilton, it was exaggerated in the show. During \"Satisfied\", Angelica explains why Hamilton is not suitable for her despite wanting him. In particular, she states, \"I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich. My father has no sons so I'm the one who has to social climb for one.\" In actuality, Angelica had less pressure on her to do this. [[Philip Schuyler]] actually had fifteen children, including two sons who survived into adulthood (one of whom was New York State Assemblyman [[Philip Jeremiah Schuyler]]), and Angelica had eloped with [[John Barker Church]] three years before she met Hamilton at her sister's wedding, when she was already a mother of two of her eight children with Church.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"The Lovesick Colonel\"</ref> Miranda stated that he chose to do this because it is stronger dramatically if Angelica is available but cannot marry him.<ref>{{cite video |last=[[Genius (website)|Genius]] |title=Hamilton: Lin-Manuel Miranda on the Play's Historical Inaccuracies |date=November 2, 2015 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ |accessdate=March 23, 2016 |via=YouTube |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412170327/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ |archivedate=April 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/7912429 |title=Satsified Lyrics and Commentary |work=Genius |access-date=May 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"bustle accuracy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/165821-how-historically-accurate-is-hamilton-a-breakdown-of-the-musicals-events-what-really-happened-so |title=How Historically Accurate Is 'Hamilton'?

For example, while Burr was present at the [[Battle of Monmouth]], Burr did not serve as Charles Lee's second in his duel with John Laurens as seen in \"Ten Duel Commandments\"; Lee's second was Evan Edwards.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"A Frenzy of Valor\"</ref> Hamilton also never approached Burr to help write ''The Federalist Papers'' as portrayed in \"Non-Stop\".<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"Publius\"</ref>\n\nDuring Act I, the character of Aaron Burr says that \"...[[Martha Washington]] named her feral tomcat after him!

The idea of Hamilton as a serial adulterer has been one of the biggest mischaracterizations of the real Alexander Hamilton for two centuries, with celebrated authors repeating the story over and over again, notwithstanding that the sexual connotation of ''tomcat'' as a womanizer did not appear in dictionaries until the first half of the 20th century. The \"tomcat\" story has been previously discredited by author Stephen Knott,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Knott |first1=Stephen F. |title='Hamilton: An American Musical' echoes John and Abigail Adams's accusations that Alexander Hamilton was a serial adulterer.

She did not send such a letter and remained in her home.\n\nIn \"Blow Us All Away\", George Eacker and Philip engage in a duel, before the events of the 1800 presidential election. The duel actually occurred in 1801, with Philip Hamilton dying on November 24.

Burr did become Jefferson's vice-president, but when Jefferson decided not to run with Burr for reelection in 1804, Burr opted to run for [[Governor of New York]] instead. Burr lost to [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]] in a landslide. Afterward, a letter was published in ''The Albany Register'' from [[Charles D.

After arriving in New York in 1776, Hamilton meets [[Aaron Burr]], [[John Laurens]], [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], and [[Hercules Mulligan]] (\"[[Aaron Burr, Sir]]\"), and impresses them with his rhetorical skills (\"[[My Shot]]\"). They affirm their revolutionary goals to each other (\"[[The Story of Tonight]]\"). Meanwhile, wealthy sisters [[Angelica Schuyler Church|Angelica]], [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton|Eliza]], and [[Peggy Schuyler]] go into town seeking out potential suitors (\"[[The Schuyler Sisters]]\"). [[Samuel Seabury]] warns everyone about the dangers of Congress, but Hamilton disagrees and tries to counter Seabury (\"[[Farmer Refuted]]\"). [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] then insists on his authority (\"[[You'll Be Back]]\"). During the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]], Hamilton accepts a position as [[George Washington]]'s [[aide-de-camp]] (\"[[Right Hand Man (Hamilton song)|Right Hand Man]]\"), instead of field command.\n\nAt Philip Schuyler's ball (\"A Winter's Ball\"),  Hamilton meets, falls in love with, and later marries Eliza Schuyler (\"[[Helpless (Hamilton song)|Helpless]]\"), as Angelica suppresses her feelings for the sake of their happiness at the wedding (\"[[Satisfied (Hamilton song)|Satisfied]]\"). After the wedding, Burr congratulates Hamilton on his position as aide-de-camp to Washington; Hamilton confesses that he would much rather have Burr's position on the battlefield (\"[[The Story of Tonight (Reprise)]]\"). Burr reflects on Hamilton's swift rise while considering his own career as more cautious (\"[[Wait for It (song)|Wait For It]]\").\n\nAs conditions worsen for the Continental Army, Hamilton aids Laurens in a [[duel]] against [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] (\"Stay Alive\"), who insulted Washington. Laurens injures Lee, who in turn yields (\"[[Ten Duel Commandments]]\"). Hamilton is temporarily suspended by Washington (\"Meet Me Inside\") over the duel and is sent home. There, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with her first child, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives (\"That Would Be Enough\"). After Lafayette convinces France to get involved on the colonists' side (\"Guns and Ships\"), he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final [[Siege of Yorktown]]. Washington agrees but explains to Hamilton\u2014who is convinced he should die a martyr and a hero in war\u2014that he should be careful with his actions because whatever he does will be known for ages to come (\"[[History Has Its Eyes on You]]\"). At the [[Siege of Yorktown]], Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out what to do to trap the British and win the war (\"[[Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)]]\").\n\nSoon after the victory at Yorktown, King George asks the rebels how they will succeed in governing on their own (\u201c[[What Comes Next?]]\u201d). Hamilton's son [[Philip Hamilton|Philip]] is born, while Burr has a daughter, [[Theodosia Burr Alston|Theodosia]], and the two tell their children how they will do anything to protect them (\"[[Dear Theodosia]]\"). Hamilton receives word that his friend Laurens has been killed in [[Battle of the Combahee River|a seemingly pointless battle]] after the war was won and throws himself into his work (\"[[Tomorrow There'll Be More of Us]]\"). He co-authors ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' and is selected as [[Secretary of the Treasury (United States)|Secretary of the Treasury]] by newly elected President Washington. Eliza begs Hamilton to stay. Angelica moves to London with her new husband (\"Non-Stop\").\n\n=== Act II ===\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] returns to America from being the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to France|U.S. ambassador to France]] (\"What'd I Miss\"). In 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate the latter's financial proposals at a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside, and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress (\"[[Cabinet Battle]] #1\").\n\nEliza and her family\u2014along with Angelica, back from London\u2014travel upstate during the summer, while Hamilton stays home to work on the compromise (\"Take a Break\"). Hamilton [[Hamilton\u2013Reynolds sex scandal|begins an affair]] with [[Maria Reynolds]], making him vulnerable to her husband's blackmail (\"[[Say No To This]]\"). Hamilton, Jefferson, and [[James Madison]] create the [[Compromise of 1790]] over a private dinner, exchanging Hamilton's financial plan for placing the country's permanent capital on the Potomac River. Burr is envious of Hamilton's sway in the government and wishes he had similar power (\"[[The Room Where It Happens]]\"). Burr switches political parties and defeats Philip Schuyler, making Hamilton now a rival (\"Schuyler Defeated\").\n\nIn another Cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in its [[War of the First Coalition|conflict with Britain]]. President Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument for remaining [[Proclamation of Neutrality|neutral]] (\"[[Cabinet Battle]] #2\"). In the wake of this, Jefferson, Madison, and Burr decide to join forces to find a way to discredit Hamilton in Washington's eyes (\"Washington on Your Side\"). Washington decides to retire from the presidency, and Hamilton assists in writing a [[George Washington's Farewell Address|farewell address]] (\"[[One Last Time (Hamilton)|One Last Time]]\").\n\nA flabbergasted King George receives word that George Washington has stepped down, and will be replaced by [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Paris]] signatory [[John Adams]] (\u201cI Know Him\u201d). John Adams [[1796 United States presidential election|becomes the second President]] and fires Hamilton, who publishes an inflammatory critique of the new president as a response (\"[[The Adams Administration]]\"). In the face of accusations of speculation of government funds by Jefferson, Madison, and Burr\u2014and out of fear that his affair with Maria Reynolds will be used against him in his political career (\"We Know\")\u2014Hamilton chooses to publicize his affair (\"Hurricane\") in the Reynolds Pamphlet (\"[[The Reynolds Pamphlet (song)|The Reynolds Pamphlet]]\"), damaging his relationship with Eliza. Eliza, in a heartbroken retaliation, burns all the letters Hamilton wrote her (\"Burn\").Philip, instructed by Hamilton, challenges [[George Eacker]] to a duel and is critically injured (\"Blow Us All Away\") and dies (\"Stay Alive (Reprise)\"), causing a reconciliation between Alexander and Eliza (\"[[It's Quiet Uptown]]\").\n\nHamilton's endorsement of Jefferson in [[1800 United States presidential election|the presidential election of 1800]] (\"The Election of 1800\") results in further animosity between Hamilton and Burr, who [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|challenges Hamilton to a duel]] via an exchange of letters (\"[[Your Obedient Servant (song)|Your Obedient Servant]]\"). Hamilton writes his last letter in a rush while Eliza tells him to go back to bed (\u201cBest of Wives and Best of Women\u201d). Burr and Hamilton travel to New Jersey for the duel. During the duel, both Burr and Hamilton fire at each other after ten paces, with Hamilton intentionally missing (''[[Deloping|throwing away]]'') his shot. Hamilton dies as a result, with Eliza and Angelica at his side. Burr laments that even though he survived, he is cursed to be remembered as the villain who killed Hamilton (\"[[The World Was Wide Enough]]\"). The musical closes with a reflection on historical memory, showing how Eliza kept Hamilton's legacy alive (\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\").\n\n== Roles and principal casts ==\n=== Original production casts ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

About the origin of the song, Yankovic said, \"Lin pitched it to me as a polka medley way more hesitantly than [he] should have. He was like, 'Would you want to do a polka medley?' I was like, 'Of course I do!{{'\"}} Since Yankovic was busy working on his new tour, he wouldn't be able to release the song in February, so he suggested calling March 2 \"February 30th\".

For example, while Angelica did have a strong relationship with Hamilton, it was exaggerated in the show. During \"Satisfied\", Angelica explains why Hamilton is not suitable for her despite wanting him. In particular, she states, \"I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich. My father has no sons so I'm the one who has to social climb for one.\" In actuality, Angelica had less pressure on her to do this. [[Philip Schuyler]] actually had fifteen children, including two sons who survived into adulthood (one of whom was New York State Assemblyman [[Philip Jeremiah Schuyler]]), and Angelica had eloped with [[John Barker Church]] three years before she met Hamilton at her sister's wedding, when she was already a mother of two of her eight children with Church.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"The Lovesick Colonel\"</ref> Miranda stated that he chose to do this because it is stronger dramatically if Angelica is available but cannot marry him.<ref>{{cite video |last=[[Genius (website)|Genius]] |title=Hamilton: Lin-Manuel Miranda on the Play's Historical Inaccuracies |date=November 2, 2015 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ |accessdate=March 23, 2016 |via=YouTube |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412170327/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ |archivedate=April 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/7912429 |title=Satsified Lyrics and Commentary |work=Genius |access-date=May 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"bustle accuracy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/165821-how-historically-accurate-is-hamilton-a-breakdown-of-the-musicals-events-what-really-happened-so |title=How Historically Accurate Is 'Hamilton'?

For example, while Burr was present at the [[Battle of Monmouth]], Burr did not serve as Charles Lee's second in his duel with John Laurens as seen in \"Ten Duel Commandments\"; Lee's second was Evan Edwards.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"A Frenzy of Valor\"</ref> Hamilton also never approached Burr to help write ''The Federalist Papers'' as portrayed in \"Non-Stop\".<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"Publius\"</ref>\n\nDuring Act I, the character of Aaron Burr says that \"...[[Martha Washington]] named her feral tomcat after him!

The idea of Hamilton as a serial adulterer has been one of the biggest mischaracterizations of the real Alexander Hamilton for two centuries, with celebrated authors repeating the story over and over again, notwithstanding that the sexual connotation of ''tomcat'' as a womanizer did not appear in dictionaries until the first half of the 20th century. The \"tomcat\" story has been previously discredited by author Stephen Knott,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Knott |first1=Stephen F. |title='Hamilton: An American Musical' echoes John and Abigail Adams's accusations that Alexander Hamilton was a serial adulterer.

She did not send such a letter and remained in her home.\n\nIn \"Blow Us All Away\", George Eacker and Philip engage in a duel, before the events of the 1800 presidential election. The duel actually occurred in 1801, with Philip Hamilton dying on November 24.

Burr did become Jefferson's vice-president, but when Jefferson decided not to run with Burr for reelection in 1804, Burr opted to run for [[Governor of New York]] instead. Burr lost to [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]] in a landslide. Afterward, a letter was published in ''The Albany Register'' from [[Charles D.

In March 2014, it became one of the four [[List of U.S. state songs#State songs|official state anthems]] of West Virginia.\n\n==Composition==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2020}}\nIn 1970, Danoff and Nivert co-wrote a song called \"I Guess He'd Rather Be in Colorado.\"  Alan Cowell, manager of the D.C. night club, The Cellar Door, where Danoff had worked as a sound and light man while attending Georgetown University, recommended it to frequent Cellar Door headliner and recent Colorado transplant John Denver.  Ultimately, \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" was the result. Danoff (from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]) has stated he had never been to West Virginia before co-writing and recording the song.\n\nInspiration for the song had come while the couple were driving along Clopper Road to a Nivert family reunion in nearby [[Montgomery County, Maryland]]. According to a radio interview with Nivert, the road is close to Washington, D.C., where Denver often worked. To pass the time en route, Danoff had made up a ballad about the little winding roads they were taking. He had even briefly considered using \"Massachusetts\" rather than \"West Virginia\" as both four-syllable state names would have fit the song's meter. Today, the landscape around [[Maryland Route 117#Cultural significance|Clopper Road]] has changed drastically and little resembles the countryside scenery that once surrounded it.\n\nTo Danoff, the lyric \"(t)he radio reminds me of my home far away\" in the bridge is quintessentially West Virginian, an allusion to listening during his '50s childhood days to the program [[Wheeling Jamboree|Saturday Night Jamboree]] on Wheeling's [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA]] from ''his'' home far away, in Springfield, Massachusetts.<ref name=\"WVUS\">{{cite web|url=https://wvusports.com/news/2014/1/29/24994_131465976649784385.aspx?path=general |title=Take Me Home, Country Roads|publisher=WVUSports.com |date=2014-01-29|accessdate=February 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDanoff had some other West Virginia associations to draw from as well. He became friends with actor [[Chris Sarandon]], a Beckley native who was once married to actress [[Susan Sarandon]], as well as a group of hippies from a West Virginia commune who used to sit in the front row of the little clubs in which his groups used to play:<ref name=\"WVUS\"/> \"They brought their dogs and were a very colorful group of folks, but that is how West Virginia began creeping into the song,\u201d Danoff said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to write about Massachusetts because I didn\u2019t think the word was musical. And the [[Bee Gees]], of course, had a hit record called ''Massachusetts'', but what did I know?\".<ref name=\"WVUS\"/>\n\nStarting December 22, 1970, Denver was heading the New Year's bill at [[The Cellar Door]], with [[Starland Vocal Band|Fat City]] opening for him, just as Denver had opened at the same club for then headliner  [[David Steinberg]]. After Tuesday the 29th's post-Christmas re-opening night (Cellar Door engagements ran from Tuesday to Sunday and this booking was for two weeks), the three headed back to the couple's apartment for an impromptu jam. On the way, Denver's left thumb was broken in a collision. He was rushed to the ER, where the thumb was put in a splint. By the time they got back to the apartment, he was, in his own words, \"wired, you know.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n \nBut when Danoff and Nivert ran through what they had of the song they had been working on for about a month, planning to sell to [[Johnny Cash]], Denver \"flipped.\" He decided he had to have it, prompting them to abandon planning for the sale.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}. The verses and chorus were still missing a bridge, so the three of them went about finishing. \n\nTaffy got out an encyclopedia to learn a little more about West Virginia, and the first thing that came upon was the [[Rhododendron]], the state flower, so she kept trying to work the word ''Rhododendron'' into the song. ''Rhododendron'' was actually the title that Taffy had written down on the lyric sheet, which they later sent to [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers|ASCAP]].<ref name=\"WVUS\"/>The three stayed up until 6:00&nbsp;a.m., changing words and moving lines around.<ref name=\"Collis 22\">{{cite book|last=Collis|first=John|title=John Denver: Mother Nature's Son|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BMuu7GKGIi4C&pg=PT22|date=30 September 2011|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|isbn=978-1-78057-330-4|page=22}}</ref>\n\nThe geographical features named in the first verse of the lyrics - [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], [[Shenandoah River]] - which are more prominent in the state of Virginia than in West Virginia, can be found in [[Jefferson County, West Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvgs.wvnet.edu/www/maps/provinces.htm|accessdate=August 25, 2018|title=Physiographic Provinces of West Virginia}}</ref>\n\nWhen they finished, on the morning of Wednesday, December 30, 1970, Denver announced that the song had to go on his next album.<ref name=\"Collis 22\"/>  Later that night, during Denver's first set, Denver called his two collaborators back to the spotlight, where the trio changed their career trajectories, reading the lyrics from a single handheld, unfolded piece of paper. The resulting ovation is said to have been five-minute long, and was certainly one of the longest in Cellar Door history. The next day was Denver's 28th birthday. They recorded it in New York City in January 1971.\n\n==Commercial performance==\n\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" appeared on the LP ''[[Poems, Prayers & Promises]]'' and was released as a [[Single (music)#7-inch format|45]] in the spring of 1971. Original pressings credited the single to \"John Denver with Fat City\". It broke nationally in mid-April but moved up the charts very slowly. After several weeks, [[RCA Records]] called John and told him that they were giving up on the single. His response: \"No! Keep working on it!\" They did, and the single went to number 1 on the ''[[Record World]]'' Pop Singles Chart and the [[Cash Box Top 100|''Cash Box'' Top 100]], and number 2 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], topped only by \"[[How Can You Mend a Broken Heart]]\" by [[The Bee Gees]].\n\nOn August 18, 1971, it was certified Gold by the RIAA for a million copies shipped.{{Certification Cite Ref |region=United States|artist=John Denver |format=single|title=Take Me Home, Country Road }}  The song continued to sell in the digital era.

In March 2014, it became one of the four [[List of U.S. state songs#State songs|official state anthems]] of West Virginia.\n\n==Composition==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2020}}\nIn 1970, Danoff and Nivert co-wrote a song called \"I Guess He'd Rather Be in Colorado.\"  Alan Cowell, manager of the D.C. night club, The Cellar Door, where Danoff had worked as a sound and light man while attending Georgetown University, recommended it to frequent Cellar Door headliner and recent Colorado transplant John Denver.  Ultimately, \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" was the result. Danoff (from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]) has stated he had never been to West Virginia before co-writing and recording the song.\n\nInspiration for the song had come while the couple were driving along Clopper Road to a Nivert family reunion in nearby [[Montgomery County, Maryland]]. According to a radio interview with Nivert, the road is close to Washington, D.C., where Denver often worked. To pass the time en route, Danoff had made up a ballad about the little winding roads they were taking. He had even briefly considered using \"Massachusetts\" rather than \"West Virginia\" as both four-syllable state names would have fit the song's meter. Today, the landscape around [[Maryland Route 117#Cultural significance|Clopper Road]] has changed drastically and little resembles the countryside scenery that once surrounded it.\n\nTo Danoff, the lyric \"(t)he radio reminds me of my home far away\" in the bridge is quintessentially West Virginian, an allusion to listening during his '50s childhood days to the program [[Wheeling Jamboree|Saturday Night Jamboree]] on Wheeling's [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA]] from ''his'' home far away, in Springfield, Massachusetts.<ref name=\"WVUS\">{{cite web|url=https://wvusports.com/news/2014/1/29/24994_131465976649784385.aspx?path=general |title=Take Me Home, Country Roads|publisher=WVUSports.com |date=2014-01-29|accessdate=February 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDanoff had some other West Virginia associations to draw from as well. He became friends with actor [[Chris Sarandon]], a Beckley native who was once married to actress [[Susan Sarandon]], as well as a group of hippies from a West Virginia commune who used to sit in the front row of the little clubs in which his groups used to play:<ref name=\"WVUS\"/> \"They brought their dogs and were a very colorful group of folks, but that is how West Virginia began creeping into the song,\u201d Danoff said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to write about Massachusetts because I didn\u2019t think the word was musical. And the [[Bee Gees]], of course, had a hit record called ''Massachusetts'', but what did I know?\".<ref name=\"WVUS\"/>\n\nStarting December 22, 1970, Denver was heading the New Year's bill at [[The Cellar Door]], with [[Starland Vocal Band|Fat City]] opening for him, just as Denver had opened at the same club for then headliner  [[David Steinberg]]. After Tuesday the 29th's post-Christmas re-opening night (Cellar Door engagements ran from Tuesday to Sunday and this booking was for two weeks), the three headed back to the couple's apartment for an impromptu jam. On the way, Denver's left thumb was broken in a collision. He was rushed to the ER, where the thumb was put in a splint. By the time they got back to the apartment, he was, in his own words, \"wired, you know.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n \nBut when Danoff and Nivert ran through what they had of the song they had been working on for about a month, planning to sell to [[Johnny Cash]], Denver \"flipped.\" He decided he had to have it, prompting them to abandon planning for the sale.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}. The verses and chorus were still missing a bridge, so the three of them went about finishing. \n\nTaffy got out an encyclopedia to learn a little more about West Virginia, and the first thing that came upon was the [[Rhododendron]], the state flower, so she kept trying to work the word ''Rhododendron'' into the song. ''Rhododendron'' was actually the title that Taffy had written down on the lyric sheet, which they later sent to [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers|ASCAP]].<ref name=\"WVUS\"/>The three stayed up until 6:00&nbsp;a.m., changing words and moving lines around.<ref name=\"Collis 22\">{{cite book|last=Collis|first=John|title=John Denver: Mother Nature's Son|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BMuu7GKGIi4C&pg=PT22|date=30 September 2011|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|isbn=978-1-78057-330-4|page=22}}</ref>\n\nThe geographical features named in the first verse of the lyrics - [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], [[Shenandoah River]] - which are more prominent in the state of Virginia than in West Virginia, can be found in [[Jefferson County, West Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvgs.wvnet.edu/www/maps/provinces.htm|accessdate=August 25, 2018|title=Physiographic Provinces of West Virginia}}</ref>\n\nWhen they finished, on the morning of Wednesday, December 30, 1970, Denver announced that the song had to go on his next album.<ref name=\"Collis 22\"/>  Later that night, during Denver's first set, Denver called his two collaborators back to the spotlight, where the trio changed their career trajectories, reading the lyrics from a single handheld, unfolded piece of paper. The resulting ovation is said to have been five-minute long, and was certainly one of the longest in Cellar Door history. The next day was Denver's 28th birthday. They recorded it in New York City in January 1971.\n\n==Commercial performance==\n\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" appeared on the LP ''[[Poems, Prayers & Promises]]'' and was released as a [[Single (music)#7-inch format|45]] in the spring of 1971. Original pressings credited the single to \"John Denver with Fat City\". It broke nationally in mid-April but moved up the charts very slowly. After several weeks, [[RCA Records]] called John and told him that they were giving up on the single. His response: \"No! Keep working on it!\" They did, and the single went to number 1 on the ''[[Record World]]'' Pop Singles Chart and the [[Cash Box Top 100|''Cash Box'' Top 100]], and number 2 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], topped only by \"[[How Can You Mend a Broken Heart]]\" by [[The Bee Gees]].\n\nOn August 18, 1971, it was certified Gold by the RIAA for a million copies shipped.{{Certification Cite Ref |region=United States|artist=John Denver |format=single|title=Take Me Home, Country Road }}  The song continued to sell in the digital era.
