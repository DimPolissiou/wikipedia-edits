Despite this, his influence and literary contribution is reflected by the fact Spanish is often referred to as \"the language of Cervantes\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=La lengua de Cervantes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf |publisher=Ministerio de la Presidencia de Espa\u00f1a |accessdate=14 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003083955/http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2008 }}</ref> \n\nIn 1569, Cervantes was forced to leave Spain and moved to Rome, where he worked in the household of a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]. In 1570, he enlisted in a [[Spanish Marine Infantry|Spanish Navy infantry]] regiment, and was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in October 1571. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by [[Barbary pirates]]; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to [[Madrid]].\n\nHis first significant novel, titled ''[[La Galatea]]'', was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, then later a government [[tax collector]]. Part One of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1605, and its immediate success allowed him to write full time for the first time. \n\nPart Two of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1615, other publications include ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'', or ''Exemplary Novels'', ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'', or ''Journey to Parnassus'', and ''Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses''. ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', or ''The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda'', was published after his death in 1616.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Capilla_del_Oidor%2C_Alcal\u00e1_de_Henares.jpg|thumb|''Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor'', in [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]], where Cervantes was reputedly baptised; the square in front is named ''Plaza Cervantes'']]\nDespite his subsequent fame, much of Cervantes' life is uncertain, including his name, background and what he looked like. Although he signed himself ''Cerbantes'', his printers used ''Cervantes'', which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used ''Saavedra'', the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual ''Cortinas'', after his mother.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nAnother area of dispute are his ethnic origins. In the 16th century, many Spaniards were descended either from [[Morisco]]s, Muslims who remained after the conquest of [[Emirate_of_Granada|Granada]] in 1492, or [[Converso]]s, Jews who converted to Catholicism after [[Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain|expulsion from Spain in 1492]]. An estimated 20% of the Spanish population in the south fell into one of these categories, and it has been suggested Cervantes' mother may have been one of these [[New Christians]].{{sfn|Byron|1978|p=32}} However, others refute this theory.{{sfn|Lokos|p=116}} \n\nNo confirmed portrait of the author is known to exist.

He was the second son of [[barber-surgeon]] Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (ca 1520\u20131593).{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=35}} Rodrigo came from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=32}} \n\nRodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly. Leonor came from [[Arganda del Rey]], and died in October 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with an eye for business. When Rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from October 1553 to April 1554, she supported the family on her own.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=34}}     \n\nCervantes' siblings were Andr\u00e9s (born 1543), Andrea (born 1544), Luisa (born 1546), Rodrigo (born 1550), Magdalena (born 1554) and Juan. They lived in C\u00f3rdoba until 1556, when his grandfather died. For reasons that are unclear, Rodrigo did not benefit from his will and the family disappears until 1564 when he filed a lawsuit in [[Seville]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=36}}\n\nSeville was then in the midst of an economic boom, and Rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother Andres, who was a junior magistrate. It is assumed Cervantes attended the Jesuit college in Seville, where one of the teachers was Jesuit playwright Pedro Pablo Acevedo, who moved there in 1561 from C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Egginton|2016|p=23}} However, legal records show his father got into debt once more, and in 1566, the family moved to [[Madrid]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===1566 to 1580; Military service and captivity===\n[[File:Cervantes Burgos.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bust of Cervantes erected in 1905, [[Burgos]].]]\nIn the 19th century, a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a Miguel de Cervantes, dated 15 September 1569, who was charged with wounding Antonio de Sigura in a duel.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=48}} Although disputed at the time, largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author, it is now accepted as the most likely reason for Cervantes leaving Madrid.{{sfn|Lokos|2016|p=118}}\n\nHe eventually made his way to Rome, where he found a position in the household of Giulio Acquaviva, an Italian bishop who spent 1568 to 1569 in Madrid, and was appointed [[Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)|Cardinal]] in 1570.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=50}} When the 1570 to 1573 [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian_War_(1570\u20131573)|Ottoman\u2013Venetian War]] began, Spain formed part of the [[Holy_League_(1571)|Holy League]], a coalition formed to support the [[Republic_of_Venice|Venetian Republic]]. Possibly seeing an opportunity to have his arrest warrant rescinded, Cervantes went to [[Kingdom_of_Naples|Naples]], then part of the [[Crown of Aragon]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=52}} \n[[File:Nafpaktos evlahos.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statue of Miguel de Cervantes at the harbour of [[Naupactus]] (Lepanto)]]\nThe military commander in Naples was Alvaro de Sande, a friend of the family, who gave Cervantes a commission under the [[\u00c1lvaro_de_Baz\u00e1n,_1st_Marquess_of_Santa_Cruz|Marquis de Santa Cruz]]. At some point, he was joined in Naples by his younger brother Rodrigo.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=52}} In September 1571, Cervantes sailed on board the ''Marquesa'', part of the Holy League fleet under Don [[John of Austria]], illegitimate half brother of [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II of Spain]]; on 7 October, they defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]].{{sfn|Davis|1999|p=199}} \n\nAccording to his own account, although suffering from malaria, Cervantes was given command of a 12-man [[skiff]], small boats used for assaulting enemy galleys.

This made finding employment difficult; other than a period in 1581 to 1582, when he was employed as an intelligence agent in North Africa, little is known of his movements prior to 1584.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=100\u2013101}} \n\nIn April of that year, Cervantes visited [[Esquivias]], to help arrange the affairs of his recently deceased friend and minor poet, Pedro Lainez. Here he met Catalina de Salazar y Palacios (ca 1566?\u20131626), eldest daughter of the widowed Catalina de Palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder Catalina owned some land of her own. This may be why in December 1584, Cervantes married her daughter, then between 15 and 18 years old.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=115\u2013116}} The first use of the name ''Cervantes Saavedra'' appears in 1586, on documents related to his marriage.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nShortly before this, his illegitimate daughter Isabel was born in November.

Such positions were unpaid, and assumed the holder lived on what they kept, which meant a degree of 'corruption' was expected. They were also subject to price fluctuations, which could go either way; he was briefly jailed several times for 'irregularities', but quickly released.

Such works were extremely short-lived, and even [[Lope de Vega]], the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=112}} In 1585, he published ''La Galatea'', a conventional [[Pastoral]] romance that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In ''Don Quixote'', he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' [[chivalric romance]]s.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=39}} His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular. First published in January 1605, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of [[Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip IV]] on 8 April.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=206}} \n[[File:Don Quijote illustrated by Gustav Dore V.jpg|thumb|upright|right|An illustration from ''Don Quijote'', by Gustave Dor\u00e9]]\nHe finally achieved a degree of financial security, while its popularity led to demands for a sequel. In the foreword to his 1613 work, ''Novelas ejemplares'', dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]]. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of ''Don Quixote'' in 1615.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=234\u2013235}}\n\nThe two parts of ''Don Quixote'' are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose, and realism; the first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.{{sfn|Mitsuo|2006|pp=148\u2013152}} The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.{{sfn|Putnam|1976|p=14}}  \n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled ''Exemplary Novels'', similar in style to [[picaresque novel]]s written by [[Lazarillo de Tormes]]. This was followed by ''Viaje del Parnaso'', or ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'', and ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\nHe was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century; literary editor [[John Bowle (writer)|John Bowle]] argued Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.{{sfn|Truman|2003|pp=9\u201331}} However, ''Don Quixote'' has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] suggested Cervantes and his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]] form part of a narrative tradition, which includes [[Homer]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], and [[James Joyce|Joyce]].{{sfn|Fuentes|1988|p=69\u201370}} \n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired ''El coloquio de los perros'', or ''[[The_Dialogue_of_the_Dogs|Dialogue of the Dogs]]'', from ''Exemplary Tales''. Two dogs, Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza, share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments. From 1871 to 1881, he and his close friend, Eduard Silberstein, wrote letters to each other, using Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza.{{sfn |Riley |1994|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nThe tricentennial of ''Don Quixote''{{'s}} publication in 1905 was marked with celebrations in Spain;<ref>{{Cite book |last=Leerssen |first=J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IElvBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT207 |title=Commemorating Writers in Nineteenth-Century Europe: Nation-Building and Centenary Fever |last2=Rigney |first2=A. |date=2014-08-12 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-137-41214-0 |pages=207 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> the 400th anniversary of his death in 2016, saw the production of ''Cervantina'', a celebration of his plays by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Teatro Cl\u00e1sico in Madrid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.centroculturalmva.es/6871/com1_fb-0/com1_md3_cd-13713/cervantina-compania-nacional-teatro-clasico-lala |title=CERVANTINA de Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Teatro Cl\u00e1sico y Ron Lal\u00e1 |date=2020-04-19 |website=www.centroculturalmva.es |language=es |access-date=2020-04-19 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes]], the largest [[digital archive]] of Spanish-language historical and literary works in the world, is named after the author.\n\n==Bibliography==\n[[File:La Galatea First Edition Title Page.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cervantes' ''La Galatea'' (1585), original title page.]]\n*''[[La Galatea]]'' (1585); \n*''El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha'' (1605): First volume of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n* ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'' (1613): a collection of 12 short stories of varied types about the social, political, and historical problems of Cervantes' Spain:\n** \"[[La gitanilla]]\" (\"The Gypsy Girl\")\n** \"El amante liberal\" (\"The Generous Lover\")\n** \"Rinconete y Cortadillo\" (\"Rinconete & Cortadillo\")\n** \"La espa\u00f1ola inglesa\" (\"The English Spanish Lady\")\n** \"[[El licenciado Vidriera]]\" (\"The Lawyer of Glass\")\n** \"La fuerza de la sangre\" (\"The Power of Blood\")\n** \"[[El celoso extreme\u00f1o]]\" (\"The Jealous Man From Extremadura\")<ref name=\"Br\"/>\n** \"La ilustre fregona\" (\"The Illustrious Kitchen-Maid\")\n** \"Novela de las dos doncellas\" (\"The Novel of the Two Damsels\")\n** \"Novela de la se\u00f1ora Cornelia\" (\"The Novel of Lady Cornelia\")\n** \"Novela del casamiento enga\u00f1oso\" (\"The Novel of the Deceitful Marriage\")\n** \"[[El coloquio de los perros]]\" (\"The Dialogue of the Dogs\")\n* ''Segunda Parte del Ingenioso Cavallero [sic] Don Quixote de la Mancha'' (1615): Second volume of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n* ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'' (1617).\n<small>Source: {{cite book |url=http://cervantes.dh.tamu.edu/V2/CPI/index.html |title=OBRAS COMPLETAS de Miguel de Cervantes |trans-title=Complete Works of Miguel de Cervantes |editor1-first=Florencio |editor1-last=Sevilla Arroyo |editor2-first=Antonio |editor2-last=Rey Hazas |publisher=Centro de Estudios Cervantinos |year=1995 |via=Proyecto Cervantes, [[Texas A&M University]]}}</small>\n\n==Other works==\n[[File:Viaje del Parnaso.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Frontispiece of the ''Viaje'' (1614)]]\nGenerally considered a mediocre poet, few survive; some appear in ''[[La Galatea]]'', while he also wrote ''Dos Canciones \u00e0 la Armada Invencible''. \n\nHis [[sonnets]] are considered his best work, particularly ''Al T\u00famulo del Rey Felipe en Sevilla'', ''Canto de Cal\u00edope'' and ''Ep\u00edstola a Mateo V\u00e1zquez''.

Despite this, his influence and literary contribution is reflected by the fact Spanish is often referred to as \"the language of Cervantes\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=La lengua de Cervantes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf |publisher=Ministerio de la Presidencia de Espa\u00f1a |accessdate=14 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003083955/http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2008 }}</ref> \n\nIn 1569, Cervantes was forced to leave Spain and moved to Rome, where he worked in the household of a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]. In 1570, he enlisted in a [[Spanish Marine Infantry|Spanish Navy infantry]] regiment, and was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in October 1571. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by [[Barbary pirates]]; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to [[Madrid]].\n\nHis first significant novel, titled ''[[La Galatea]]'', was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, then later a government [[tax collector]]. Part One of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1605, and its immediate success allowed him to write full time for the first time. \n\nPart Two of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1615, other publications include ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'', or ''Exemplary Novels'', ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'', or ''Journey to Parnassus'', and ''Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses''. ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', or ''The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda'', was published after his death in 1616.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Capilla_del_Oidor%2C_Alcal\u00e1_de_Henares.jpg|thumb|''Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor'', in [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]], where Cervantes was reputedly baptised; the square in front is named ''Plaza Cervantes'']]\nDespite his subsequent fame, much of Cervantes' life is uncertain, including his name, background and what he looked like. Although he signed himself ''Cerbantes'', his printers used ''Cervantes'', which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used ''Saavedra'', the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual ''Cortinas'', after his mother.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nAnother area of dispute are his ethnic origins. In the 16th century, many Spaniards were descended either from [[Morisco]]s, Muslims who remained after the conquest of [[Emirate_of_Granada|Granada]] in 1492, or [[Converso]]s, Jews who converted to Catholicism after [[Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain|expulsion from Spain in 1492]]. An estimated 20% of the Spanish population in the south fell into one of these categories, and it has been suggested Cervantes' mother may have been one of these [[New Christians]].{{sfn|Byron|1978|p=32}} However, others refute this theory.{{sfn|Lokos|p=116}} \n\nNo confirmed portrait of the author is known to exist.

He was the second son of [[barber-surgeon]] Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (ca 1520\u20131593).{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=35}} Rodrigo came from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=32}} \n\nRodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly. Leonor came from [[Arganda del Rey]], and died in October 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with an eye for business.

Here he met Catalina de Salazar y Palacios (ca 1566?\u20131626), eldest daughter of the widowed Catalina de Palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder Catalina owned some land of her own.

Such works were extremely short-lived, and even [[Lope de Vega]], the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=112}} In 1585, he published ''La Galatea'', a conventional [[Pastoral]] romance that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In ''Don Quixote'', he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' [[chivalric romance]]s.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=39}} His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular.

In the foreword to his 1613 work, ''Novelas ejemplares'', dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]]. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of ''Don Quixote'' in 1615.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=234\u2013235}}\n\nThe two parts of ''Don Quixote'' are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose, and realism; the first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.{{sfn|Mitsuo|2006|pp=148\u2013152}} The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.{{sfn|Putnam|1976|p=14}}  \n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled ''Exemplary Novels'', similar in style to [[picaresque novel]]s written by [[Lazarillo de Tormes]]. This was followed by ''Viaje del Parnaso'', or ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'', and ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\nHe was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century; literary editor [[John Bowle (writer)|John Bowle]] argued Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.{{sfn|Truman|2003|pp=9\u201331}} However, ''Don Quixote'' has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] suggested Cervantes and his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]] form part of a narrative tradition, which includes [[Homer]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], and [[James Joyce|Joyce]].{{sfn|Fuentes|1988|p=69\u201370}} \n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired ''El coloquio de los perros'', or ''[[The_Dialogue_of_the_Dogs|Dialogue of the Dogs]]'', from ''Exemplary Tales''. Two dogs, Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza, share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments.

His works span the transition between the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] eras in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") shows an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from [[deafness]]. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]] which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his great patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. His problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life are exemplified by his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) and his unsent letter to his \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824. Written in his last years, his [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late string quartets]] of 1825\u201326 are amongst his final achievements.

In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations.

In 1807 the musician and publisher [[Muzio Clementi]] secured the rights for publishing his works in England, and Haydn's former patron [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Prince Esterh\u00e1zy]] commissioned a mass (the [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C]], Op. 86) for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert which he organized in December 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth (''Pastoral'')]] symphonies, the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], extracts from the Mass in C, the [[aria|scena and aria]] ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' Op. 65 and the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy op. 80]]. There was a large audience, (including Czerny and the young [[Ignaz Moscheles]]). But it was under-rehearsed, involved many stops and starts, and during the Fantasia Beethoven was noted shouting at the musicians \"badly played, wrong, again!\" The financial outcome is unknown.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=445-448}}\n\n[[File:Rudolf-habsburg-olmuetz.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's patron, [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788\u20131831)|Archduke Rudolf]]; portrait by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder|Johann Baptist von Lampi]]]]In the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the Royal Theatre, Beethoven had received an offer from Napoleon's brother [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], then king of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], for a well-paid position as [[Kapellmeister]] at the court in [[Kassel|Cassel]].

Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor [[String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)|String Quartet Op. 95]], to which Beethoven gave the subtitle ''Quartetto serioso'', and the Op. 97 [[Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)|Piano Trio in B flat major]] known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph as the ''Archduke Trio''.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 7}}\n\nIn the spring of 1811 Beethoven became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever.

The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed however for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed.

Despite this he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Sonata in A flat major Op. 110]] was published in December), and on the Mass.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 776-777, 781-782}} In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including him lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 362 -363}} Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. In November the [[Philharmonic Society]] of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which was working.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 833-834}} Also in November Prince [[Nikolay Borisovich Galitzin|Nikolay Galitzin]] of [[Saint Petersburg]] offered to pay Beethoven's asking price for three string quartets.

He was not however in a hurry to get it published or performed as he had formed a notion that he could profitably sell manuscripts of the work to various courts in Germany and Europe at 50 ducats each. One of the few who took up this offer was [[Louis XVIII]] of France, who also sent Beethoven a heavy gold medallion.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=812-829}} The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited may other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and [[Carl Friedrich Peters]]. (In the end it was obtained by [[Schott Music|Schotts]]).{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=186}}\n\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works. He told the visiting [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz]] in 1822:<blockquote>You will hear nothing of me here [...] ''Fidelio''? They cannot give it, nor do they want to listen to it. The symphonies? They have no time for them. My concertos? Everyone grinds out only the stuff he himself has made. The solo pieces? They went out of fashion long ago, and here fashion is everything. At the most, [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh|Schuppanzigh]] occasionally digs up a quartet.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=801}}</blockquote> He therefore enquired about premiering the ''Missa'' and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and the symphony was first performed, along with sections of the ''Missa Solemnis'', on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the [[K\u00e4rntnertortheater]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 9}}{{refn|The first full performance of the ''Missa Solemnis'' had aldready been given in St. Petersburg by Golitsin, who had been a subscriber for the manuscript 'preview' that Beethoven had arranged.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}|group=n}} Beethoven stood by the conductor [[Michael Umlauf]] during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=351}} The ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit&nbsp;... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads.\" The concert did not make much money for Beethoven, as the expenses of mounting it were very high.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=317}} A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 318}}\n\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Galitzin, despite failing health. The first of these, the [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|quartet in E\u266d major, Op. 127]] was premiered by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] in March 1825. While writing the next,  the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|quartet in A minor, Op. 132]], in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in [[Baden]], he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title \"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the [[Lydian mode]].\" {{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} The next quartet to be completed was the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Thirteenth, op. 130]], in B\u266d major. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved to be very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet). Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher [[Artaria]], for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the [[Grosse Fugue]], Op. 133).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 974-975}} Beethoven's favourite was the last of this series, the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|quartet in C{{music|#}} minor Op. 131]], which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}}\n\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of [[Gneixendorf]] with Beethoven and his other uncle Johann. Whilst in Gneixendorf Beethoven completed a further quartet,  ([[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Op. 135 in F major]]) which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (\"Must it be?\");  the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (\"It must be!\"). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (\"The Difficult Decision\").{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=977}} Following this in November Beethoven completed his last composition, the new finale for the op. 130 quartet.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed;{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710 }} he began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann made Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 1014}}\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[ File:Beethoven on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|Beethoven on his deathbed; sketch by [[Josef Danhauser]]]]On his return to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again. He was attended until his death by Dr. Andreas Wawruch, who throughout December noticed symptoms including [[jaundice]] and [[dropsy]], with swollen limbs and  breathing difficulties. Operations were carried out to tap off the excess fluid from his abdomen.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=1017-1024}}\n\nKarl stayed by Beethoven's bedside during December, but left at the beginning of January to join  the army at [[Jihlava|Iglau]] and did not see his uncle again, although he wrote to him shortly afterwards \"My dear father [...] I am living in contentment and regret only that I am separated from you.\" Immediately following Karl's departure, Beethoven wrote a will making Karl his sole heir.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=377}} Later in January Beethoven was attended by Dr. Malfatti, whose treatment (recognizing the seriousness of his patient's condition) was largely centred on alcohol. As news spread of the severity of Beethoven's condition, many friends, both old and new, came to visit, including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]] and his pupil [[Ferdinand Hiller]]. Many tributes were also sent, including \u00a3100 from the Philharmonic Society in London and a case of wine from Schotts.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=378-379}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} During this period he was almost completely bedridden despite occasional brave efforts to rouse himself. On March 24, he said to Schindler and the others present \"Plaudite, amici, comoedia finita est\" (\"Applaud, friends, the comedy is over.\") Later that day, when the wine from Schott arrived, he whispered \"Pity - too late.\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=380-381}}\n\nHe died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56; only his friend [[Anselm H\u00fcttenbrenner]] and a \"Frau van Beethoven\" (possibly his old enemy Johanna van Beethoven) were present. According to H\u00fcttenbrenner, at about 5 in the afternoon there was a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder: \"Beethoven opened his eyes, lifted his right hand  and looked up for several seconds with his first clenched [...] not another breath, not a heartbeat more.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=1050-1051}} Many visitors came to the death-bed; locks of the dead man's hair were retained by H\u00fcttenbrenner and Hiller, amongst others.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=381-382}}{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=44}} An [[autopsy]] revealed significant [[liver]] damage, which may have been due to heavy alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}} It also revealed considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.{{sfn|SaccentiSmildeSaris|2011}}{{sfn|SaccentiSmildeSaris|2012}}{{refn|There is dispute about the cause of his death: [[alcoholic cirrhosis]], [[syphilis]], [[infectious hepatitis]], [[lead poisoning]], [[sarcoidosis]] and [[Whipple's disease]] have all been proposed.{{sfn|Mai|2006}} Surviving locks of his hair have been subjected to additional analysis, as have skull fragments removed during the 1863 [[exhumation]].{{sfn|Meredith|2005 |pp=2\u20133}} Some of these analyses have led to controversial assertions that he was accidentally [[poison]]ed by excessive doses of lead-based treatments administered under instruction from his doctor.{{sfn|Eisinger|2008}}{{sfn|Lorenz|2007}}|group=n}}\n\nBeethoven's funeral procession in Vienna on 29 March 1827 was attended by an estimated 10,000 people.{{sfn|Taruskin|2004|p=687}} [[Franz Schubert]] and the violinist [[Joseph Mayseder]] were among the torchbearers. A funeral oration by the poet [[Franz Grillparzer]] was read. He was buried in a dedicated grave in the [[W\u00e4hring]] cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a requiem mass at the church of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeitskirche) in Alserstrasse. His remains were [[exhume]]d for study in 1863, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's [[Zentralfriedhof]] where they were reinterred in a grave adjacent to that of Schubert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}}{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=1053-1056}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{further|Beethoven's musical style|Beethoven and C minor|List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n\n=== The \"three periods\" ===\nThe historian William Drabkin notes that as early as 1818 a writer had proposed a three-period division of Beethoven's works, and that such a division (albeit often adopting different dates or works to denote changes in period) eventually became a convention adopted by all of Beethoven's biographers, starting with Schindler, [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis|F.-J. F\u00e9tis]] and  [[Wilhelm von Lenz]]. Later writers sought to identify sub-periods within this generally accepted structure. Its drawbacks include that it generally omits a fourth period, that is, the early years in Bonn, whose works are less often considered; and that it ignores the differential development of Beethoven's composing styles over the years for different categories of work. The piano sonatas, for example, were written throughout Beethoven's life in a progression that can be interpreted as continuous development; the symphonies do not all demonstrate linear progress; of all of the types of composition, perhaps the quartets, which seem to group themselves in three periods (Op. 18 in 1801-1802, Opp. 59, 74 and 95 in 1806-1814, and the quartets, today known as 'late', from 1824 onwards) fit this categorization most neatly. Drabkin concludes  that \"now that we have lived with them so long [...] as long as there are programme notes, essays written to accompany recordings, and all-Beethoven recitals, it is hard to imagine us ever giving up the notion of discrete stylistic periods.\" {{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=198-200}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 11}}\n\n===Bonn===\nSome forty compositions, including ten very early works written by Beethoven up to 1785, survive from the years that Beethoven lived in Bonn. It has been suggested that Beethoven largely abandoned composition between 1785 and 1790, possibly as a result of negative critical reaction to his first published works. A 1784 review in [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]]'s influential ''Musikalischer Almanack'' compared Beethoven's efforts to those of rank beginners.{{sfn|Solomon|1972|p=169}} Most of Beethoven's surviving works from this period were written after he turned twenty, between 1790 and 1792.  Scholars generally regard these early efforts as bland and uninspired and have concluded that his first efforts at writing in the classical sonata style (with the exception of his Wind Octet) were poorly conceived. [[Gustav Nottebohm]], for example, wrote of Beethoven's Dressler Variations (WoO 63), \"they show not a trace of contrapuntal independent part-writing. They are figural variations of the simplest kind\".<ref>Nottebohm, Gustav (1873) [https://archive.org/details/beethovensstudi01nottgoog ''Beethovens Studien'']. Leipzig & Winterthur. p. 10</ref> [[T\u00e9odor de Wyzewa]] considered his early \"Kurf\u00fcrsten Sonatas\" written in 1783 (WoO 47) as merely \"correct imitations of Haydn.\".<ref>Wyzewa, T\u00e9odor de (1914) ''Beethoven et Wagner''. Paris. p. 44</ref> Considered as a whole, Beethoven's compositional efforts in Bonn demonstrate the importance of his move to Vienna in terms of the development of his musical style and the sophistication of his grasp of classical form and idiom.\n\n===The first period===\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===The middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original [[Beethovenhalle]] in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of [[Franz Liszt]]).

His works span the transition between the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] eras in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") shows an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from [[deafness]]. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]] which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his great patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. His problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life are exemplified by his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) and his unsent letter to his \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824. Written in his last years, his [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late string quartets]] of 1825\u201326 are amongst his final achievements. After some months of bedridden illness he [[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|died in 1827]]. Beethoven's works in all genres remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== Family and early life ===\n[[File:Beethoven house of birth Bonn 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's birthplace at Bonngasse&nbsp;20, Bonn, now the [[Beethoven House]] museum]]\nBeethoven was the grandson of [[Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773)|Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1712\u20131773), a musician from the town of [[Mechelen]] in the Austrian [[Duchy of Brabant]] (in what is now the [[Flemish region]] of Belgium) who had moved to [[Bonn]] at the age of 21.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=407}} Ludwig was employed as a [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the court of [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]], eventually rising to become, in 1761, [[Kapellmeister]] (music director) and hence a pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=12\u201317}} Ludwig had one son, [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]] (1740\u20131792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and [[violin]] lessons to supplement his income.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}} \n\nJohann married [[Maria Magdalena Keverich]] in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701\u20131751), who had been the head chef at the court of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Archbishopric of Trier]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}} Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn at what is now the [[Beethoven House]] Museum, Bonnstrasse 20.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.beethoven.de/en/about-us#history |title=Beethoven-Haus History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Beethoven-Haus Bonn |publisher= |access-date=16 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref> There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his [[baptism]], in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus, (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=53}}\n\nOf the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. [[Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven|Kaspar Anton Karl]] was born on 8 April 1774, and [[Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven|Nikolaus Johann]], (generally known as Johann) the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776.{{sfn|Stanley|2000|p=7}}\n\nBeethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court [[organist]] Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and [[viola]]).{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}} From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=22, 32}} His musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with his son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to promote his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=57\u20138}}\n\n===1780\u20131792: Bonn ===\n[[File:Christian Gottlob Neefe.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Christian Gottlob Neefe.

In addition, some minor works not listed with opus numbers or in the WoO list have [[Catalogues of Beethoven compositions#Hess catalogue|Hess catalogue]] numbers.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=210}}|group=n}} Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1782), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=65\u201370}} His [[Three Piano Sonatas, WoO 47 (Beethoven)|first three piano sonatas]], WoO 47, sometimes known as \"{{lang|de|[[Kurf\u00fcrst]]}}\" (\"Elector\") for their dedication to the Elector [[Maximilian Friedrich von K\u00f6nigsegg-Rothenfels|Maximilian Friedrich]] (1708\u20131784), were published in 1783.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=69}} In the same year the first printed reference to Beethoven appeared in the ''Magazin der Musik'' \u2013 \"Louis van Beethoven [sic] ... a boy of 11 years and most promising talent.

He gave some support to Beethoven, appointing him Court Organist and paying towards his visit to Vienna of 1792. {{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=50}}\n\nHe was introduced in these years to several people who became important in his life. He often visited the cultivated von Breuning family, at whose home he taught piano to some of the children, and where the widowed Frau von Breuning offered him a motherly friendship. Here he also met [[Franz Gerhard Wegeler|Franz Wegeler]], a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend (and was to marry one of the von Breuning daughters). The von Breuning family environment offered an alternative to his home life, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline. Another frequenter of the von Breunings was [[Count Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel von Waldstein|Count Ferdinand von Waldstein]], who became a friend and financial supporter during Beethoven's Bonn period.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 2}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=55}}{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 51\u201352}} Waldstein was to commission in 1791 Beethoven's first work for the stage, the ballet ''Musik zu einem Ritterballett'' (WoO 1).{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p= 121\u2013122}}\n\n[[File:Count von Waldstein.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Count Waldstein: portrait by  [[Anton\u00edn Machek]], c. 1800]]In the period 1785\u201390 there is virtually no record of Beethoven's activity as a composer. This may be attributed to the lukewarm response his initial publications had attracted, and also to ongoing problems in the Beethoven family.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=36\u201337}} His mother died in 1787, shortly after Beethoven\u2019s first visit to Vienna, where he stayed for about two weeks and almost certainly met Mozart.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 2}} In 1789 Beethoven's father was forcibly retired from the service of the Court (as a consequence of his alcoholism) and it was ordered that half of his father's pension be paid directly to Ludwig for support of the family.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=95}} He contributed further to the family's income by teaching (to which Wegeler said he had \"an extraordinary aversion\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=51}}) and by playing [[viola]] in the court orchestra. This familiarized him with a variety of operas, including works by Mozart, [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] and [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=95\u201398}} Here he also befriended [[Anton Reicha]], a composer, [[flute|flautist]] and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor, [[Josef Reicha]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=96}}\n\nFrom 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed a number of works (none were published at the time) showing a growing range and maturity. [[Musicologist]]s have identified a theme similar to those of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in a set of variations written in 1791.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 35\u201341}} It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (WoO 87),  and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=93\u201394}} These two ''Emperor Cantatas'' were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s, when they were described by [[Johannes Brahms]] as \"Beethoven through and through\" and as such prophetic of the style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=107\u2013111}}\n\nBeethoven was probably first introduced to [[Joseph Haydn]] in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 35}} A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the [[Redoute, Bad Godesberg|Redoute in Godesberg]]. It is likely that arrangements were made at that time for Beethoven to study with the older master.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 41}} Waldstein wrote to him before his departure: \u201cYou are going to Vienna in fulfilment of your long-frustrated wishes [\u2026] With the help of assiduous labour you shall receive Mozart\u2019s spirit from Haydn\u2019s hands.\u201d{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 2}}\n\n===1792\u20131802: Vienna - the early years ===\n[[File:Beethoven Riedel 1801.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Beethoven as a young man, c. 1800, by Carl Traugott Riedel (1769\u20131832)]]Beethoven left Bonn for Vienna in November 1792, amid rumours of [[First Coalition|war spilling out of France]]; he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 42}}  Over the next few years, Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartian flavour.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 43}}\n\nHe did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction,{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 3}} he sought to master [[counterpoint]]. He also studied violin under [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47, 54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=149}}\n\nWith Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.{{sfn|Ronge|2013}} However, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, F\u00fcrst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\nAssisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=59}} His friend [[Nikolaus Simrock]] began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf|Dittersdorf]] (WoO 66).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\n[[File:\u00d6lenhainz - Franz Joseph Maximilian von Lobkowitz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince Lobkowitz: portrait by [[August Friedrich Oelenhainz]]]]His first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, where he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s.{{refn|It is uncertain whether this was the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]].

They were published in 1801. He also completed his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime. With premieres of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]] Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 58}}  For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the [[Burgtheater]] on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as \"the most interesting concert in a long time,\" was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}} By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 97}}\n\n[[File:Josephine Brunsvik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Josephine Brunsvik, pencil miniature (unknown artist), before 1804.]]In May 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik.

The young [[Carl Czerny]], who later became a renowned music teacher himself, studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. In late 1801, he met a young countess, [[Julie Guicciardi]], through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing this.

In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations.

The idea of creating a symphony based on the career of [[Napoleon]] may have been suggested to Beethoven by [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Count Bernadotte]] in 1798.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 4}} Beethoven, sympathetic to the ideal of the heroic revolutionary leader, originally gave the symphony the title \"Bonaparte\", but disillusioned by Napoleon [[1804 French constitutional referendum|declaring himself Emperor in 1804]], he scratched Napoleon's name from the manuscript's title page, and the symphony was published in 1806 with its present title and the subtitle \"to celebrate the memory of a great man.\"{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 6}} The ''Eroica'' was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony.

Some of his early patrons, including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 78\u201379}} Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria ]], the youngest son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]], who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him.  They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|pp=300\u201301}} Beethoven was to dedicate 14 compositions to Rudolf, including some of his major works such as the [[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|''Archduke'' Trio]] Op. 97 (1811) and ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' Op. 123 (1823).\n\nHis position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on ''Leonore'', (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered, under its present tile of ''Fidelio'' in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]]. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of ''Fidelio'' was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 150}}\n\nDespite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher [[Muzio Clementi]] secured the rights for publishing his works in England, and Haydn's former patron [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Prince Esterh\u00e1zy]] commissioned a mass (the [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C]], Op. 86) for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert which he organized in December 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth (''Pastoral'')]] symphonies, the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], extracts from the Mass in C, the [[aria|scena and aria]] ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' Op. 65 and the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy op. 80]]. There was a large audience, (including Czerny and the young [[Ignaz Moscheles]]). But it was under-rehearsed, involved many stops and starts, and during the Fantasia Beethoven was noted shouting at the musicians \"badly played, wrong, again!\" The financial outcome is unknown.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=445-448}}\n\n[[File:Rudolf-habsburg-olmuetz.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's patron, [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788\u20131831)|Archduke Rudolf]]; portrait by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder|Johann Baptist von Lampi]]]]In the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the Royal Theatre, Beethoven had received an offer from Napoleon's brother [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], then king of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], for a well-paid position as [[Kapellmeister]] at the court in [[Kassel|Cassel]].

[[Egmont (Beethoven)|The result]] (an overture, and nine additional [[entracte]]s and vocal pieces, Op. 84), which appeared in 1810 fitted well with Beethoven's \"heroic\" style and he became interested in Goethe, setting three of his poems as songs (Op. 83) and learning about the poet from a mutual acquaintance, [[Bettina Brentano]] (who also wrote to Goethe at this time about Beethoven). Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor [[String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)|String Quartet Op. 95]], to which Beethoven gave the subtitle ''Quartetto serioso'', and the Op. 97 [[Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)|Piano Trio in B flat major]] known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph as the ''Archduke Trio''.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 7}}\n\nIn the spring of 1811 Beethoven became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever.

Advised again to visit Teplitz in 1812 he met there with Goethe,  who wrote: \"His talent amazed me; unfortunately he is an utterly untamed personality, who is not altogether wrong in holding the world to be detestable, but surely does not make it any more enjoyable [...] by his attitude.\" Beethoven wote to his publishers [[Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel]] that \"Goethe delights far too much in the court atmosphere, far more than is becoming in a poet.\"{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 7}} But following their meeting he began a setting for choir and orchestra of [[Meeresstille und gl\u00fcckliche Fahrt (Beethoven)|Goethe's ''Meeresstille und gl\u00fcckliche Fahrt'']] ''(Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage)'' (Op. 112), completed in 1815.

Unsympathetic to the sorts of trends in German romanticism that featured the supernatural (as in operas by [[Louis Spohr]], [[Heinrich Marschner]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber]], he also \"resisted the impending Romantic fragmentation of the [...] cyclic forms of the Classical era into small forms and lyric mood pieces\" and turned towards study of Bach, [[George Frederic Handel|Handel]] and [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]].{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=295}} An old connection was renewed in 1817 when Maelzel sought, and obtained, Beethoven's endorsement for his newly developed [[metronome]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=684-686}} During these years the few major works completed include Beethoven's only [[song cycle]], ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'' Op. 98, (1816), and the gigantic [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' Sonata]] (Sonata No. 29 in B flat major, Op. 106) (1818).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 659, 717}} It was also in 1818 that he began musical sketches that eventually form part of his final Ninth Symphony.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=322}}\n\nBy early 1818 Beethoven's health had improved, and his nephew Karl, now aged 11, moved in with him in January, (although within a year Karl's mother had won him back in the courts).{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=41}} By now his hearing had again significantly deteriorated, necessitating Beethoven and his interlocutors writing in notebooks to carry out conversations. These 'conversation books' are a rich written resource for his life from this period onwards. They contain discussions about music, business and personal life; they are also a valuable source for his contacts and for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and of his opinions of the art of music.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=164-167}} {{refn|It was suggested by Beethoven's  biographer [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]] that, of 400 conversation books, 264 were destroyed (and others were altered) after his death by his secretary  Schindler, who wished only an idealised biography to survive.{{sfn|Clive|2001|p=239}} The music historian [[Theodore Albrecht]] has however demonstrated that Thayer's allegations were over the top. \"[It is now] abundantly clear that Schindler never possessed as many as c. 400 conversation books, and that he never destroyed roughly five-eighths of that number.\"{{sfn|Albrecht|2009|p=181}} Schindler did however insert a number of fraudulent entries that bolstered his own profile and his prejudices.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=52}}{{sfn|Nettl|1994|p=103}} Presently 136 books covering the period 1819-1827 are preserved at the [[Staatsbibliothek Berlin]], with another two at the Beethoven-Haus in Bonn.{{sfn|Hammelmann|1965|p=187}}|group=n}} His household management had also improved somewhat; Nanette Streicher, who had assisted in his care during his illness, continued to provide some support, and he finally found a skilled cook.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 260}} A testimonial to the esteem in which Beethoven was held in England was the presentation to him in this year by Thomas Broadwood, the proprietor of the company, of a [[John Broadwood & Sons|Broadwood piano]], for which Beethoven expressed grateful thanks.

The first was the announcement of Archduke Rudolf's promotion to [[Cardinal]]-[[Archbishop]] and Archbishop of [[Olomouc]] (now in Czechia), which triggered the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' Op. 123, intended to be ready for his installation in Olomouc in March 1820. The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed however for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed. Beethoven was typically underwhelmed:  when in an April 1820 conversation book a friend mentioned Gebauer,  Beethoven wrote in reply \"Geh!

Despite this he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Sonata in A flat major Op. 110]] was published in December), and on the Mass.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 776-777, 781-782}} In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including him lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 362 -363}} Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. In November the [[Philharmonic Society]] of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which was working.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 833-834}} Also in November Prince [[Nikolay Borisovich Galitzin|Nikolay Galitzin]] of [[Saint Petersburg]] offered to pay Beethoven's asking price for three string quartets. Beethoven set the price at the high level of 50 ducats per quartet in a letter dictated to his nephew Karl, who was then living with him.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=815-816}}\n\n===1823\u20131827: The final years===\n[[File:Beethoven Waldmuller 1823.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Beethoven in 1823 by [[Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller]]]]The year 1823 saw the completion of three notable works, all of which had occupied Beethoven for some years, namely the ''Missa Solemnis'', the Ninth Symphony and the ''Diabelli Variations''.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 879}}\n\nBeethoven at last presented the manuscript of the completed ''Missa'' to Rudolph on 19 March (more than a year after the Archduke's enthronement as Archbishop). He was not however in a hurry to get it published or performed as he had formed a notion that he could profitably sell manuscripts of the work to various courts in Germany and Europe at 50 ducats each. One of the few who took up this offer was [[Louis XVIII]] of France, who also sent Beethoven a heavy gold medallion.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=812-829}} The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited may other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and [[Carl Friedrich Peters]]. (In the end it was obtained by [[Schott Music|Schotts]]).{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=186}}\n\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works. He told the visiting [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz]] in 1822:<blockquote>You will hear nothing of me here [...] ''Fidelio''? They cannot give it, nor do they want to listen to it. The symphonies? They have no time for them. My concertos? Everyone grinds out only the stuff he himself has made. The solo pieces? They went out of fashion long ago, and here fashion is everything. At the most, [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh|Schuppanzigh]] occasionally digs up a quartet.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=801}}</blockquote> He therefore enquired about premiering the ''Missa'' and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and the symphony was first performed, along with sections of the ''Missa Solemnis'', on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the [[K\u00e4rntnertortheater]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 9}}{{refn|The first full performance of the ''Missa Solemnis'' had aldready been given in St. Petersburg by Golitsin, who had been a subscriber for the manuscript 'preview' that Beethoven had arranged.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}|group=n}} Beethoven stood by the conductor [[Michael Umlauf]] during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=351}} The ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit&nbsp;... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads.\" The concert did not make much money for Beethoven, as the expenses of mounting it were very high.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=317}} A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 318}}\n\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Galitzin, despite failing health. The first of these, the [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|quartet in E\u266d major, Op. 127]] was premiered by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] in March 1825. While writing the next,  the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|quartet in A minor, Op. 132]], in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in [[Baden]], he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title \"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the [[Lydian mode]].\" {{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} The next quartet to be completed was the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Thirteenth, op. 130]], in B\u266d major. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved to be very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet). Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher [[Artaria]], for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the [[Grosse Fugue]], Op. 133).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 974-975}} Beethoven's favourite was the last of this series, the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|quartet in C{{music|#}} minor Op. 131]], which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}}\n\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of [[Gneixendorf]] with Beethoven and his other uncle Johann. Whilst in Gneixendorf Beethoven completed a further quartet,  ([[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Op. 135 in F major]]) which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (\"Must it be?\");  the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (\"It must be!\"). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (\"The Difficult Decision\").{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=977}} Following this in November Beethoven completed his last composition, the new finale for the op. 130 quartet.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed;{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710 }} he began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann made Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 1014}}\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[ File:Beethoven on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|Beethoven on his deathbed; sketch by [[Josef Danhauser]]]]On his return to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again.

As news spread of the severity of Beethoven's condition, many friends, both old and new, came to visit, including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]] and his pupil [[Ferdinand Hiller]]. Many tributes were also sent, including \u00a3100 from the Philharmonic Society in London and a case of wine from Schotts.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=378-379}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} During this period he was almost completely bedridden despite occasional brave efforts to rouse himself.

F\u00e9tis]] and  [[Wilhelm von Lenz]]. Later writers sought to identify sub-periods within this generally accepted structure. Its drawbacks include that it generally omits a fourth period, that is, the early years in Bonn, whose works are less often considered; and that it ignores the differential development of Beethoven's composing styles over the years for different categories of work. The piano sonatas, for example, were written throughout Beethoven's life in a progression that can be interpreted as continuous development; the symphonies do not all demonstrate linear progress; of all of the types of composition, perhaps the quartets, which seem to group themselves in three periods (Op. 18 in 1801-1802, Opp. 59, 74 and 95 in 1806-1814, and the quartets, today known as 'late', from 1824 onwards) fit this categorization most neatly. Drabkin concludes  that \"now that we have lived with them so long [...] as long as there are programme notes, essays written to accompany recordings, and all-Beethoven recitals, it is hard to imagine us ever giving up the notion of discrete stylistic periods.\" {{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=198-200}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 11}}\n\n===Bonn===\nSome forty compositions, including ten very early works written by Beethoven up to 1785, survive from the years that Beethoven lived in Bonn. It has been suggested that Beethoven largely abandoned composition between 1785 and 1790, possibly as a result of negative critical reaction to his first published works. A 1784 review in [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]]'s influential ''Musikalischer Almanack'' compared Beethoven's efforts to those of rank beginners.{{sfn|Solomon|1972|p=169}} Most of Beethoven's surviving works from this period were written after he turned twenty, between 1790 and 1792.  Scholars generally regard these early efforts as bland and uninspired and have concluded that his first efforts at writing in the classical sonata style (with the exception of his Wind Octet) were poorly conceived. [[Gustav Nottebohm]], for example, wrote of Beethoven's Dressler Variations (WoO 63), \"they show not a trace of contrapuntal independent part-writing. They are figural variations of the simplest kind\".<ref>Nottebohm, Gustav (1873) [https://archive.org/details/beethovensstudi01nottgoog ''Beethovens Studien'']. Leipzig & Winterthur. p. 10</ref> [[T\u00e9odor de Wyzewa]] considered his early \"Kurf\u00fcrsten Sonatas\" written in 1783 (WoO 47) as merely \"correct imitations of Haydn.\".<ref>Wyzewa, T\u00e9odor de (1914) ''Beethoven et Wagner''. Paris. p. 44</ref> Considered as a whole, Beethoven's compositional efforts in Bonn demonstrate the importance of his move to Vienna in terms of the development of his musical style and the sophistication of his grasp of classical form and idiom.\n\n===The first period===\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===The middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship. The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period.<ref name=\"Steinberg2006\">{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Michael P.|authorlink=Michael P.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original [[Beethovenhalle]] in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of [[Franz Liszt]]). A statue to Mozart had been unveiled in [[Salzburg]], Austria, in 1842. Vienna did not honour Beethoven with a statue until 1880.{{sfn|Comini|2008|p=316}}\n\nThere is a museum, the [[Beethoven House]], the place of his birth, in central Bonn. The same city has hosted a musical festival, the [[Beethovenfest]], since 1845. The festival was initially irregular but has been organised annually since 2007.\n\nThe [[Ira F.

FIFPro, with its global headquarters in Hoofddorp, Netherlands, is made up of 63 national players' associations. In addition, there are five candidate members and eight observers.<ref name=FIFPro/>\n\n== History ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nOn 15 December 1965, representatives of the French, Scottish, English, Italian and Dutch players' associations met in Paris, with the objective of setting up an international federation for footballers. In the second half of June 1966, the first FIFPro congress took place in London, just before the start of the World Championship. The articles of association of FIFPro were thereby adopted and the objectives accurately laid down. FIFPro was responsible for increasing the solidarity between professional footballers and players' associations. FIFPro tried to offer the players' associations or other interest associations the means for mutual consultation and co-operation to achieve their objectives. In addition, it wished to co-ordinate the activities of the different affiliated groups in order to promote the interests of all professional footballers. Indeed, FIFPro likewise had in mind propagating and defending the rights of professional footballers. The emphasis was thereby laid on the freedom of the football player to be able to choose the club of his choice at the end of his contract. It was likewise laid down that FIFPro would be helpful in every required area for setting up interest associations. These are objectives which still apply to this day.\n\nIt was originally laid down that a congress would be held once every four years at a minimum \u2013 prior to the World Championship. The congress had to uphold the course set out and with a two-third majority vote. The congress is still the most important organ of FIFPro to this very day. It soon appeared that it was necessary to organize a congress annually, and not to limit this to once every four years. Many congresses have been held in the meantime, such as for example in 1978 in Madrid and in 1979 in Athens and Venice. In the eighties and nineties many memorable congresses have been organized in almost all the large European cities, such as Paris, Athens, Milan, Manchester, Z\u00fcrich, Ghent, Lisbon, Edinburgh, Copenhagen, Tel Aviv, Rome, Johannesburg, Barcelona, Santiago and Budapest. The latest congress was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in November 2010.\n\nThe objectives of FIFPro also mean that not only FIFA applied as a talking partner. UEFA in particular, but also the European parliament and the European Commission appeared to be important points of approach. The national federations also started to become increasingly aware that, in addition to the national players' association, the international trade union FIFPro also played its role.\n\nIn recent years, FIFPro has grown from a European organization into a global network. The FIFPro has done much to support countries on other continents \u2013 Asia/Oceania, Africa and South America \u2013 in their efforts to set up players' associations. In October 2012, FIFPro welcomed the footballers' associations of Croatia, Czech Republic, Montenegro and Ukraine as its newest members.\n\nIn 2013, FIFPro launched a legal challenge against the transfer system.<ref name=\"FIFProOfficial\">{{cite news |url=http://www.fifpro.org/news/news_details/2455 |title=FIFPro announces legal challenge to transfer system |publisher=FIFPro Official Website |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFProTelegraph\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10523185/Fifpro-to-launch-legal-challenge-against-transfer-system-because-it-shackles-players.html |title=Fifpro to launch legal challenge against transfer system because it 'shackles' players |publisher=The Telegraph |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFProGuardian\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/17/players-union-fifpro-transfer-system-european-courts |title=Players' union Fifpro to take transfer system to European courts |publisher=The Guardian |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFProBBC\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25418135 |title=Football transfer system must change, says world players' union |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref> FIFPro president Phillipe Piat said \"the transfer system fails 99% of players around the world, it fails football as an industry and it fails the world's most beloved game\".

Barnes argues that \"the system encourages speculative, unsustainable, immoral and illegal investment models like third-party ownership of players\".<ref name=\"FIFProGuardian\" />\n\n== Current board ==\n\n{{update|section|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe FIFPro board consists of eleven members, including president Philippe Piat, for the term 2013\u20132017.

the world to compose the best men's team of the year, named the FIFPro World 11 (also known as the FIFPro World XI). Every player was requested to pick one goalkeeper, four defenders, three midfielders and three forwards.<ref name=Ronaldinho /> In 2009, the world players' union joined hands with [[FIFA]]. While the format remained the same, the award name changed to the '''FIFA FIFPro World11'''. This became the only team award picked by all professional footballers worldwide.\n\nEach year in September, approximately 45,000 voting ballots are sent out to professional footballers' associations that are FIFPro members or candidate members, who are then asked to distribute the forms among all professional footballers in their countries. In October these are returned to FIFPro's head office.

FIFPro, with its global headquarters in Hoofddorp, Netherlands, is made up of 63 national players' associations. In addition, there are five candidate members and eight observers.<ref name=FIFPro/>\n\n== History ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nOn 15 December 1965, representatives of the French, Scottish, English, Italian and Dutch players' associations met in Paris, with the objective of setting up an international federation for footballers. In the second half of June 1966, the first FIFPro congress took place in London, just before the start of the World Championship. The articles of association of FIFPro were thereby adopted and the objectives accurately laid down. FIFPro was responsible for increasing the solidarity between professional footballers and players' associations. FIFPro tried to offer the players' associations or other interest associations the means for mutual consultation and co-operation to achieve their objectives. In addition, it wished to co-ordinate the activities of the different affiliated groups in order to promote the interests of all professional footballers. Indeed, FIFPro likewise had in mind propagating and defending the rights of professional footballers. The emphasis was thereby laid on the freedom of the football player to be able to choose the club of his choice at the end of his contract. It was likewise laid down that FIFPro would be helpful in every required area for setting up interest associations. These are objectives which still apply to this day.\n\nIt was originally laid down that a congress would be held once every four years at a minimum \u2013 prior to the World Championship. The congress had to uphold the course set out and with a two-third majority vote. The congress is still the most important organ of FIFPro to this very day. It soon appeared that it was necessary to organize a congress annually, and not to limit this to once every four years. Many congresses have been held in the meantime, such as for example in 1978 in Madrid and in 1979 in Athens and Venice. In the eighties and nineties many memorable congresses have been organized in almost all the large European cities, such as Paris, Athens, Milan, Manchester, Z\u00fcrich, Ghent, Lisbon, Edinburgh, Copenhagen, Tel Aviv, Rome, Johannesburg, Barcelona, Santiago and Budapest. The latest congress was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in November 2010.\n\nThe objectives of FIFPro also mean that not only FIFA applied as a talking partner. UEFA in particular, but also the European parliament and the European Commission appeared to be important points of approach. The national federations also started to become increasingly aware that, in addition to the national players' association, the international trade union FIFPro also played its role.\n\nIn recent years, FIFPro has grown from a European organization into a global network. The FIFPro has done much to support countries on other continents \u2013 Asia/Oceania, Africa and South America \u2013 in their efforts to set up players' associations. In October 2012, FIFPro welcomed the footballers' associations of Croatia, Czech Republic, Montenegro and Ukraine as its newest members.\n\nIn 2013, FIFPro launched a legal challenge against the transfer system.<ref name=\"FIFProOfficial\">{{cite news |url=http://www.fifpro.org/news/news_details/2455 |title=FIFPro announces legal challenge to transfer system |publisher=FIFPro Official Website |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFProTelegraph\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10523185/Fifpro-to-launch-legal-challenge-against-transfer-system-because-it-shackles-players.html |title=Fifpro to launch legal challenge against transfer system because it 'shackles' players |publisher=The Telegraph |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFProGuardian\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/17/players-union-fifpro-transfer-system-european-courts |title=Players' union Fifpro to take transfer system to European courts |publisher=The Guardian |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFProBBC\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25418135 |title=Football transfer system must change, says world players' union |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref> FIFPro president Phillipe Piat said \"the transfer system fails 99% of players around the world, it fails football as an industry and it fails the world's most beloved game\".

Barnes argues that \"the system encourages speculative, unsustainable, immoral and illegal investment models like third-party ownership of players\".<ref name=\"FIFProGuardian\" />\n\n== Current board ==\n\n{{update|section|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe FIFPro board consists of eleven members, including president Philippe Piat, for the term 2013\u20132017.

the world to compose the best men's team of the year, named the FIFPro World 11 (also known as the FIFPro World XI). Every player was requested to pick one goalkeeper, four defenders, three midfielders and three forwards.<ref name=Ronaldinho /> In 2009, the world players' union joined hands with [[FIFA]]. While the format remained the same, the award name changed to the '''FIFA FIFPro World11'''. This became the only team award picked by all professional footballers worldwide.\n\nEach year in September, approximately 45,000 voting ballots are sent out to professional footballers' associations that are FIFPro members or candidate members, who are then asked to distribute the forms among all professional footballers in their countries.

It was released on September 23, 2008, by [[Hollywood Records]]. Lovato started working on the album in September 2007, during filming of her [[Disney Channel]] television film ''[[Camp Rock]]''. Lovato co-wrote most of the songs with American boy band the [[Jonas Brothers]], who produced the album alongside record producer [[John Fields (record producer)|John Fields]]. The album also includes [[Kara DioGuardi]], [[Jason Reeves (songwriter)|Jason Reeves]] and [[Rooney (band)|Rooney]] frontman [[Robert Schwartzman]], who collaborated from the album. ''Don't Forget'' features primarily a [[pop rock]] sound, with the lyrical content dealing with various adolescent topics.\n\nThe album was met with generally positive reviews from critics. Due to most of the album being produced by the Jonas Brothers, critics noted distinctive similarities between the artists. ''Don't Forget'' debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was eventually certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It has sold over 530,000 copies in the United States. Elsewhere, ''Don't Forget'' reached the top ten on the [[Canadian Albums Chart]] and reached the top forty in Spain and New Zealand.\n\n\"[[Get Back (Demi Lovato song)|Get Back]]\" was released as the lead single from the album and reached number 43 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \"[[La La Land (Demi Lovato song)|La La Land]]\" was the second single from the album. The song peaked at number 52 in the United States and inside the top 40 in Ireland and United Kingdom.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:DemiLovatoJonasBrothersAug10.jpg|thumb|right|Lovato starred in ''Camp Rock'' with the [[Jonas Brothers]], who helped her during the production and writing process of ''Don't Forget'']]\nLovato was discovered by [[Disney Channel]] during an open call [[audition]] in her hometown of [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] and made her debut on the short series ''[[As the Bell Rings (U.S. TV series)|As the Bell Rings]]'' in 2007.

It was released on September 23, 2008, by [[Hollywood Records]]. Lovato started working on the album in September 2007, during filming of her [[Disney Channel]] television film ''[[Camp Rock]]''. Lovato co-wrote most of the songs with American boy band the [[Jonas Brothers]], who produced the album alongside record producer [[John Fields (record producer)|John Fields]]. The album also includes [[Kara DioGuardi]], [[Jason Reeves (songwriter)|Jason Reeves]] and [[Rooney (band)|Rooney]] frontman [[Robert Schwartzman]], who collaborated from the album. ''Don't Forget'' features primarily a [[pop rock]] sound, with the lyrical content dealing with various adolescent topics.\n\nThe album was met with generally positive reviews from critics. Due to most of the album being produced by the Jonas Brothers, critics noted distinctive similarities between the artists.

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of AllMusic wrote a positive review  of album, calling it \"pure pop for tween people\". He said that the \"parade of urgent, insistent guitar pop\" is what makes the album memorable, stating, \"the kind of pop that feels disposable but winds up sticking around longer than its more considered cousins. This kind of trashy fun was missing on ''A Little Bit Longer,'' so it's nice to find that it surfaces proudly on ''Don't Forget''.\"<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that the album sounds \"like a female-fronted Jonas Brothers\". Levine was positive regarding Lovato's vocals on the album, saying that \"she's certainly a stronger singer than the Jonases. In fact, her full-bodied vocal performances are consistently impressive.\" He noted that the album's \"relatively risqu\u00e9 moments [...] come on the tracks that the Jonases have nothing to do with.\" Levine rated the album three out of five stars and wrote \"None of its eleven songs is terrific, but none is terrible either, and Lovato makes a good first impression, coming off like a more innocent, less try-hard [[Katy Perry]].\"<ref name=\"DigitalSpy\"/>\n\nJoey Guerra of ''Houston Chronicle'' stated that the album \"casts Lovato as a female counterpart to the Jonas Brothers\". Guerra was mixed regarding Lovato's vocal delivery on the album, calling it \"at times too earnest\".<ref name=\"Houston\"/> He also noted that \"her rock tendencies sometimes dwindle into unmelodic misses\". He concluded his review, writing, \"at 16 years old, Lovato should be allowed some wide-eyed wiggle room. ''Don't Forget'' does its job and leaves her room to grow.\"<ref name=\"Houston\"/> Michael Slezak of ''Entertainment Weekly'' graded the album a C and wrote, \"The ''Camp Rock'' star Demi Lovato's debut album might be an indication that today's crop of rocker ''grrrls'' {{sic}} are taking their inspiration from [[Ashlee Simpson]] rather than, say, [[Janis Joplin]].\"<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Don't Forget'' debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 89,000 copies in its first week of release.<ref name=\"billboarddebut\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1596037/metallica-1-third-week-row.jhtml |title=Metallica Are #1 For Third Week In A Row, As Death Magnetic Nears Million-Sold Mark |date=October 1, 2008 |work=MTV News.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{in use}}\n{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Beginning in September 1899 several employees of the DCS&I, which had a policy of not employing unionized members, [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union, and were subsequently terminated. After the intervention of law enforcement, the strike was settled three months later when the DCS&I reaffirmed their policy of not hiring union members.<ref>Dub\u00e9 2008, p. 4</ref>\n\nThe Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a [[froth flotation|flotation plant]] to produce [[copper sulfate]] in the 1920s. [[iron ore|Iron]] and [[zinc#production|zinc concentrate]]s were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s.

The unions fought for control of the entire company, and two subsequent votes held by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) failed to resolve the dispute.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

The concert's performers included all of Stax's prominent artists at the time. The genres of the songs performed included [[soul music|soul]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[R&B]], [[blues]], [[funk]], and [[jazz]]. Months after the festival, Stax released a double LP of the concert's highlights titled ''Wattstax: The Living Word''. The concert was filmed by [[David L. Wolper]]'s film crew and was made into the 1973 film titled, ''Wattstax''.  The film was directed by [[Mel Stuart]] and nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] award for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary Film|Best Documentary Film]] in 1974.\n\n==Festival production==\n\n===Development===\nStax Record's West Coast director, Forrest Hamilton, came up with the idea for the Wattstax concert. Being in Los Angeles during the Watts Riots in 1965, Hamilton later became aware of the yearly Watts Summer Festival that commemorated the revolt.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\nHamilton contacted Stax Records' main offices in Memphis, TN and told them his idea to have a benefit-concert for the seventh Watts Summer Festival. At first, Stax was not so sure about putting together a small concert, with big stars, for a small community such as Watts. [[Tommy Jacquette]], the founder of the Watts Summer Festival, was contacted about the festival idea. With Jacquette being supportive, the concert idea was slowly developing into something larger.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\nStax president [[Al Bell]], who was very involved in planning the concert, decided that if the festival was going to be as big as he imagined, the festival could not just be held at a small park in Watts. It had to be held somewhere like the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]. A team of several Stax directors, including Jacquette, contacted the L.A. Coliseum to schedule a meeting. When the meeting took place, the managers at the Coliseum were not convinced that \"a little record company\" from Memphis could sell enough tickets to fill the stadium.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nStax picked a date - August 20, 1972 - which was [[Isaac Hayes]]'s 30th birthday and a few days after the seventh anniversary of the Watts Riots. The name of the concert - \"Wattstax\" - was formed to include \"Watts\", as in the neighborhood, and \"Stax\", the name of the record company putting the show together. All seats were reserved and only priced at only one dollar each, as Stax wanted to make it possible for anyone to attend. Presales were quite successful, easing concerns about the financial viability of the concert.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\n===Construction===\nThe stage was built the day before the concert, with construction starting in the middle of the night and continuing into the morning. This conflict happened because a football game was scheduled on the night of August 19 between the [[Oakland Raiders]] and the [[Los Angeles Rams]], the home team for the Los Angeles Coliseum.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" /> Immediately after the football game, trucks full of long wood-planks drove onto the field. The stage was built right in the center of the field and was built high enough where artists could walk/sit under (a little less than 20 feet tall).<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\nA platform was built that lead from the road (where artists would walk from) to the side stairs of the stage. The seats were hand-cleaned and trash was picked up all around the Coliseum. Also, due to the Coliseum's policy, there could be no seating on the field to prevent the grass being ruined for the Rams' next game on August 21.<ref name=\"AlBellCommentary\">{{cite video|people=Bell,  Al |date=January 10, 2006 |title=''Wattstax'': Audio commentary with Al Bell, Isaac Hayes, et al |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070902/ |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Home Video |location=Burbank, CA |accessdate=April 18, 2020 |}}</ref> During the Wattstax concert in fact, an issue arose when much of the audience poured onto the field to dance while Rufus Thomas performed \"[[Do the Funky Chicken]]\". Stax executive Larry Shaw immediately asked Thomas to get the audience to return to the stands, leading to a memorable moment in the documentary film when one particular straggler refuses to leave and Thomas makes pointed fun of him.<ref name=\"AlBellCommentary\" />\n\nThe bleachers were set-up so that there would be more seating that included a better view of the stag, and a fence was built around the stage for the artists' safety. In addition, a large group of African-American policemen from the [[LAPD]] were requested to be scattered inside and outside the Coliseum.<ref name=\"BowmanChuckDCommentary\">{{cite video|people=Bowman, Rob (Historian) |date=January 10, 2006 |title=''Wattstax'': Audio commentary with Rob Bowman and Chuck D |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070902/ |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Home Video |location=Burbank, CA |accessdate=April 18, 2020 |}}</ref>\n\nThe dressing rooms for Stax's artists were outside/behind the stadium, and two vans were rented to drive the artists up to the stage and back to the dressing rooms. Portable restrooms were rented (for the artists to use before and after their sets) and placed right under the side of the stage. Colored stage lighting was hammered onto poles on each corner of the stage. Stacked speakers were placed in each corner of the fenced area. below the stage, a long table was placed to hold several open reel tape recorders, capturing the concert performances for later release on records.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\nA film crew, made up of a significant number of African-Americans at Stax's request,<ref name=\"AlBellCommentary\" /> was scattered from the top-row of the stadium to the corners of the stage where the artists were zoomed-in-on. The film crew was told to capture the artists singing, but also get shots of the crowd dancing. 112,000 patron attended the Wattstax concert, which was said to be the largest gathering of African-Americans outside of a civil rights event to that date.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\n==Festival==\nAt around 1:45&nbsp;p.m., the Coliseum grounds started to be swarmed with L.A.'s Black population. Guards stamped tickets and told concertgoers where their seats were located. The stadium's seats filled up hastily, while the production-team was making sure everything was good to go. The concert's orchestra (dubbed ''The Wattstax'72 Orchestra'') and its composer, [[Dale Warren]], sat until 2:38&nbsp;p.m. ready to play their warm-up instrumental titled \"Salvation Symphony\". At 2:38&nbsp;p.m., the first song was performed to a crowd of 112,000 (mostly African-American).\n\n===Performing artists===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=35em|\n* 2:38: \"Salvation Symphony\" by Dale Warren\n* 2:57: \"Star Spangled Banner\" by Kim Weston\n* 3:01: \"Speech\" by Tommy Jacquette\n* 3:05: \"Speeches\" by Anonymous Speakers\n* 3:13: \"Introduction/I Am Somebody\" by Jesse Jackson\n* 3:19: \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" by Kim Weston\n* 3:23: \"Speech and Staple Singers Intro\" by Melvin Van Peebles AND \"Heavy Makes You Happy\" by Staple Singers\n* 3:27: \"Are You Sure\" by Staple Singers\n* 3:31: \"I Like The Things About Me\" by Staple Singers\n* 3:37: \"Respect Yourself\" by Staple Singers\n* 3:42: \"I\u2019ll Take You There\" by Staple Singers\n* 3:47: \"Somebody Bigger than You and I\"  by Jimmy Jones\n* 3:52: \"Precious Lord, Take My Hand\" by Deborah Manning\n* 3:57: \"Better Get A Move On\" by Louise McCord\n* 4:01: \"Unknown\" by Eric Mercury \n* 4:04: \"Unknown\" by Freddy Robinson\n* 4:09: \"Them Hot Pants\" by Lee Sain\n* 4:13: \"Unknown\" by Ernie Hines\n* 4:17: \"Wade In The Water\" by Little Sonny\n* 4:21: \"Pin The Tail On The Donkey\" by The Newcomers\n* 4:24: \"Explain It To Her Mama\" by The Temprees\n* 4:27: \"I\u2019ve Been Lonely\" by Frederick Knight\n* 4:31: \"I Forgot To Be Your Lover\" by William Bell\n* 4:34: \"Knock On Wood\" by Eddie Floyd\n* 4:38: \"Old Time Religion\" by The Golden Thirteen\n* 4:42: \"Lying on the Truth\" by Rance Allen\n* 4:46: \"Up Above My Head\" by Rance Allen\n* 4:50: \"Introduction\" by David Porter\n* 4:54: \"Ain't That Loving You\" by David Porter\n* 4:58: \"Can't See You When I Want to\" by David Porter\n* 5:09: \"Reach Out and Touch\" by David Porter\n* 5:12: \"Son of Shaft\" by The Bar-Kays\n* 5:18: \"Feel It\" by The Bar-Kays\n* 5:23: \"In the Hole\" by The Bar-Kays\n* 5:26: \"I Can\u2019t Turn You Loose\" by The Bar-Kays\n* 5:31: \"Unknown Performances\" by Tommy Tate\n* 5:41: \"I Like What You\u2019re Doing\" by Carla Thomas\n* 5:46: \"[[Gee Whiz (Look at His Eyes)]]\" by [[Carla Thomas]]\n* 5:49: \"B-A-B-Y\" by Carla Thomas\n* 5:52: \"Pick Up the Pieces\" by Carla Thomas\n* 5:55: \"I Have a God Who Loves\" by Carla Thomas\n* 6:00: \"Matchbox Blues\" by Albert King\n* 6:05: \"Got to Be Some Changes Made\" by Albert King\n* 6:11: \"I'll Play the Blues for You\" by Albert King\n* 6:17: \"Killing Floor\" by Albert King\n* 6:21: \"Angel of Mercy\" by Albert King \n* 6:26: \"Breakdown\" by Rufus Thomas<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2003/06/13/wattstax/ |title=Wattstax |date=13 June 2003 |first1=Owen |last1=Gleiberman |accessdate=26 January 2020}}</ref>\n* 6:32: \"Do the Funky Chicken\" by Rufus Thomas\n* 6:39: \"Do the Funky Penguin\" by Rufus Thomas\n* 6:45: \"I Don't Know What This World Is Coming to\" by The Soul Children\n* 6:52: \"Hearsay\" by The Soul Children\n* 7:00: \"Speech\" by Fred Williamson and Jesse Jackson\n* 7:03: \"If Loving you is Wrong\" by Luther Ingram\n* 7:06: \"[[Theme from Shaft]]\" by Isaac Hayes\n* 7:12: \"Soulsville\" by Isaac Hayes\n* 7:17: \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" by Isaac Hayes\n}}\n\n==Film production==\nStax Films' 1973 release of ''Wattstax'' includes, in addition to sets by Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, the Staples Singers, the Bar-Kays, and many others, musical performances by artists who were unable to perform during the actual Wattstax concert.

The concert's performers included all of Stax's prominent artists at the time. The genres of the songs performed included [[soul music|soul]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[R&B]], [[blues]], [[funk]], and [[jazz]]. Months after the festival, Stax released a double LP of the concert's highlights titled ''Wattstax: The Living Word''. The concert was filmed by [[David L. Wolper]]'s film crew and was made into the 1973 film titled, ''Wattstax''.  The film was directed by [[Mel Stuart]] and nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] award for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary Film|Best Documentary Film]] in 1974.\n\n==Festival production==\n\n===Development===\nStax Record's West Coast director, Forrest Hamilton, came up with the idea for the Wattstax concert. Being in Los Angeles during the Watts Riots in 1965, Hamilton later became aware of the yearly Watts Summer Festival that commemorated the revolt.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\nHamilton contacted Stax Records' main offices in Memphis, TN and told them his idea to have a benefit-concert for the seventh Watts Summer Festival. At first, Stax was not so sure about putting together a small concert, with big stars, for a small community such as Watts. [[Tommy Jacquette]], the founder of the Watts Summer Festival, was contacted about the festival idea. With Jacquette being supportive, the concert idea was slowly developing into something larger.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\nStax president [[Al Bell]], who was very involved in planning the concert, decided that if the festival was going to be as big as he imagined, the festival could not just be held at a small park in Watts. It had to be held somewhere like the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]. A team of several Stax directors, including Jacquette, contacted the L.A. Coliseum to schedule a meeting. When the meeting took place, the managers at the Coliseum were not convinced that \"a little record company\" from Memphis could sell enough tickets to fill the stadium.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nStax picked a date - August 20, 1972 - which was [[Isaac Hayes]]'s 30th birthday and a few days after the seventh anniversary of the Watts Riots. The name of the concert - \"Wattstax\" - was formed to include \"Watts\", as in the neighborhood, and \"Stax\", the name of the record company putting the show together. All seats were reserved and only priced at only one dollar each, as Stax wanted to make it possible for anyone to attend. Presales were quite successful, easing concerns about the financial viability of the concert.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\n===Construction===\nThe stage was built the day before the concert, with construction starting in the middle of the night and continuing into the morning. This conflict happened because a football game was scheduled on the night of August 19 between the [[Oakland Raiders]] and the [[Los Angeles Rams]], the home team for the Los Angeles Coliseum.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" /> Immediately after the football game, trucks full of long wood-planks drove onto the field. The stage was built right in the center of the field and was built high enough where artists could walk/sit under (a little less than 20 feet tall).<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\nA platform was built that lead from the road (where artists would walk from) to the side stairs of the stage. The seats were hand-cleaned and trash was picked up all around the Coliseum. Also, due to the Coliseum's policy, there could be no seating on the field to prevent the grass being ruined for the Rams' next game on August 21.<ref name=\"AlBellCommentary\">{{cite video|people=Bell,  Al |date=January 10, 2006 |title=''Wattstax'': Audio commentary with Al Bell, Isaac Hayes, et al |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070902/ |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Home Video |location=Burbank, CA |accessdate=April 18, 2020 |}}</ref> During the Wattstax concert in fact, an issue arose when much of the audience poured onto the field to dance while Rufus Thomas performed \"[[Do the Funky Chicken]]\". Stax executive Larry Shaw immediately asked Thomas to get the audience to return to the stands, leading to a memorable moment in the documentary film when one particular straggler refuses to leave and Thomas makes pointed fun of him.<ref name=\"AlBellCommentary\" />\n\nThe bleachers were set-up so that there would be more seating that included a better view of the stag, and a fence was built around the stage for the artists' safety. In addition, a large group of African-American policemen from the [[LAPD]] were requested to be scattered inside and outside the Coliseum.<ref name=\"BowmanChuckDCommentary\">{{cite video|people=Bowman, Rob (Historian) |date=January 10, 2006 |title=''Wattstax'': Audio commentary with Rob Bowman and Chuck D |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070902/ |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Home Video |location=Burbank, CA |accessdate=April 18, 2020 |}}</ref>\n\nThe dressing rooms for Stax's artists were outside/behind the stadium, and two vans were rented to drive the artists up to the stage and back to the dressing rooms. Portable restrooms were rented (for the artists to use before and after their sets) and placed right under the side of the stage. Colored stage lighting was hammered onto poles on each corner of the stage. Stacked speakers were placed in each corner of the fenced area. below the stage, a long table was placed to hold several open reel tape recorders, capturing the concert performances for later release on records.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\nA film crew, made up of a significant number of African-Americans at Stax's request,<ref name=\"AlBellCommentary\" /> was scattered from the top-row of the stadium to the corners of the stage where the artists were zoomed-in-on. The film crew was told to capture the artists singing, but also get shots of the crowd dancing. 112,000 patron attended the Wattstax concert, which was said to be the largest gathering of African-Americans outside of a civil rights event to that date.<ref name=\"RobGordonRespectYourselfWattstax\" />\n\n==Festival==\nAt around 1:45&nbsp;p.m., the Coliseum grounds started to be swarmed with L.A.'s Black population. Guards stamped tickets and told concertgoers where their seats were located. The stadium's seats filled up hastily, while the production-team was making sure everything was good to go. The concert's orchestra (dubbed ''The Wattstax'72 Orchestra'') and its composer, [[Dale Warren]], sat until 2:38&nbsp;p.m. ready to play their warm-up instrumental titled \"Salvation Symphony\". At 2:38&nbsp;p.m., the first song was performed to a crowd of 112,000 (mostly African-American).\n\n===Performing artists===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=35em|\n* 2:38: \"Salvation Symphony\" by Dale Warren\n* 2:57: \"Star Spangled Banner\" by Kim Weston\n* 3:01: \"Speech\" by Tommy Jacquette\n* 3:05: \"Speeches\" by Anonymous Speakers\n* 3:13: \"Introduction/I Am Somebody\" by Jesse Jackson\n* 3:19: \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" by Kim Weston\n* 3:23: \"Speech and Staple Singers Intro\" by Melvin Van Peebles AND \"Heavy Makes You Happy\" by Staple Singers\n* 3:27: \"Are You Sure\" by Staple Singers\n* 3:31: \"I Like The Things About Me\" by Staple Singers\n* 3:37: \"Respect Yourself\" by Staple Singers\n* 3:42: \"I\u2019ll Take You There\" by Staple Singers\n* 3:47: \"Somebody Bigger than You and I\"  by Jimmy Jones\n* 3:52: \"Precious Lord, Take My Hand\" by Deborah Manning\n* 3:57: \"Better Get A Move On\" by Louise McCord\n* 4:01: \"Unknown\" by Eric Mercury \n* 4:04: \"Unknown\" by Freddy Robinson\n* 4:09: \"Them Hot Pants\" by Lee Sain\n* 4:13: \"Unknown\" by Ernie Hines\n* 4:17: \"Wade In The Water\" by Little Sonny\n* 4:21: \"Pin The Tail On The Donkey\" by The Newcomers\n* 4:24: \"Explain It To Her Mama\" by The Temprees\n* 4:27: \"I\u2019ve Been Lonely\" by Frederick Knight\n* 4:31: \"I Forgot To Be Your Lover\" by William Bell\n* 4:34: \"Knock On Wood\" by Eddie Floyd\n* 4:38: \"Old Time Religion\" by The Golden Thirteen\n* 4:42: \"Lying on the Truth\" by Rance Allen\n* 4:46: \"Up Above My Head\" by Rance Allen\n* 4:50: \"Introduction\" by David Porter\n* 4:54: \"Ain't That Loving You\" by David Porter\n* 4:58: \"Can't See You When I Want to\" by David Porter\n* 5:09: \"Reach Out and Touch\" by David Porter\n* 5:12: \"Son of Shaft\" by The Bar-Kays\n* 5:18: \"Feel It\" by The Bar-Kays\n* 5:23: \"In the Hole\" by The Bar-Kays\n* 5:26: \"I Can\u2019t Turn You Loose\" by The Bar-Kays\n* 5:31: \"Unknown Performances\" by Tommy Tate\n* 5:41: \"I Like What You\u2019re Doing\" by Carla Thomas\n* 5:46: \"[[Gee Whiz (Look at His Eyes)]]\" by [[Carla Thomas]]\n* 5:49: \"B-A-B-Y\" by Carla Thomas\n* 5:52: \"Pick Up the Pieces\" by Carla Thomas\n* 5:55: \"I Have a God Who Loves\" by Carla Thomas\n* 6:00: \"Matchbox Blues\" by Albert King\n* 6:05: \"Got to Be Some Changes Made\" by Albert King\n* 6:11: \"I'll Play the Blues for You\" by Albert King\n* 6:17: \"Killing Floor\" by Albert King\n* 6:21: \"Angel of Mercy\" by Albert King \n* 6:26: \"Breakdown\" by Rufus Thomas<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2003/06/13/wattstax/ |title=Wattstax |date=13 June 2003 |first1=Owen |last1=Gleiberman |accessdate=26 January 2020}}</ref>\n* 6:32: \"Do the Funky Chicken\" by Rufus Thomas\n* 6:39: \"Do the Funky Penguin\" by Rufus Thomas\n* 6:45: \"I Don't Know What This World Is Coming to\" by The Soul Children\n* 6:52: \"Hearsay\" by The Soul Children\n* 7:00: \"Speech\" by Fred Williamson and Jesse Jackson\n* 7:03: \"If Loving you is Wrong\" by Luther Ingram\n* 7:06: \"[[Theme from Shaft]]\" by Isaac Hayes\n* 7:12: \"Soulsville\" by Isaac Hayes\n* 7:17: \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" by Isaac Hayes\n}}\n\n==Film production==\nStax Films' 1973 release of ''Wattstax'' includes, in addition to sets by Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, the Staples Singers, the Bar-Kays, and many others, musical performances by artists who were unable to perform during the actual Wattstax concert.

It is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]. PATH trains run around the clock year round; four routes serving 13 stations operate during the daytime on weekdays, while two routes operate during weekends, late nights, and holidays. Its tracks cross the [[Hudson River]] through century-old [[cast iron]] tubes that rest on the river bottom under a thin layer of silt. It operates as a deep-level subway in Manhattan and the Jersey City/Hoboken riverfront; from Grove Street in Jersey City to Newark, trains run in [[Cut (earthmoving)|open cuts]], at grade level, and on [[Elevated railway|elevated track]].\n\nThe routes of the PATH system were originally operated by the '''Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (H&M)''', built to link New Jersey's [[Hudson Waterfront]] with New York City. The system began operations in 1908 and was fully built out in 1911. Three stations have since closed; two others were re-located after a re-alignment of the western terminus. From the 1920s, the rise of automobile travel and the concurrent construction of bridges and tunnels across the river sent the H&M into a financial decline from which it never recovered, and it was forced into [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] in 1954. As part of the deal that cleared the way for the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|original World Trade Center]], the Port Authority bought the H&M out of receivership in 1962 and renamed it PATH. In the 2000s and 2010s the system suffered considerably from disasters that affected the region, most notably the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Hurricane Sandy]]. Both private and public stakeholders have proposed expanding PATH service in New Jersey, and construction on an extension to [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] is projected to start in 2020.\n\nAlthough PATH has long operated as a rapid transit system, it is legally a [[commuter rail]]road under the jurisdiction of the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA); its trackage between Newark and Jersey City is located in close proximity to [[Northeast Corridor]] trackage and shares the [[Dock Bridge|Newark Dock Bridge]] with intercity and commuter trains. All PATH train operators must therefore be licensed railroad engineers and extra inspections are required. PATH currently uses one class of rolling stock, the PA5, which was delivered in 2009\u20132011.\n\n==History==\n\n==={{Anchor|Early history}}Hudson & Manhattan Railroad===\nThe PATH system predates the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[Early history of the IRT subway|first underground line]], operated by the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]]. The Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (H&M) was planned in 1874, but it was not possible at that time to safely tunnel under the [[Hudson River]]. Construction began on the existing tunnels in 1890, but soon stopped when funding ran out. It resumed in 1900 under the direction of [[William Gibbs McAdoo]], an ambitious young lawyer who had moved to New York from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], and later became president of the H&M.<ref name=\"Fitzherbert\">{{cite web|last=Fitzherbert, Anthony|url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/path/hmhistory.html|title=\"The Public Be Pleased\": William G.

Additionally, all PATH train operators must be federally certified [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers|locomotive engineers]], and the agency must conduct more detailed safety inspections than other rapid transit systems.

It is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]. PATH trains run around the clock year round; four routes serving 13 stations operate during the daytime on weekdays, while two routes operate during weekends, late nights, and holidays. Its tracks cross the [[Hudson River]] through century-old [[cast iron]] tubes that rest on the river bottom under a thin layer of silt. It operates as a deep-level subway in Manhattan and the Jersey City/Hoboken riverfront; from Grove Street in Jersey City to Newark, trains run in [[Cut (earthmoving)|open cuts]], at grade level, and on [[Elevated railway|elevated track]].\n\nThe routes of the PATH system were originally operated by the '''Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (H&M)''', built to link New Jersey's [[Hudson Waterfront]] with New York City. The system began operations in 1908 and was fully built out in 1911. Three stations have since closed; two others were re-located after a re-alignment of the western terminus. From the 1920s, the rise of automobile travel and the concurrent construction of bridges and tunnels across the river sent the H&M into a financial decline from which it never recovered, and it was forced into [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] in 1954. As part of the deal that cleared the way for the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|original World Trade Center]], the Port Authority bought the H&M out of receivership in 1962 and renamed it PATH. In the 2000s and 2010s the system suffered considerably from disasters that affected the region, most notably the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Hurricane Sandy]]. Both private and public stakeholders have proposed expanding PATH service in New Jersey, and construction on an extension to [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] is projected to start in 2020.\n\nAlthough PATH has long operated as a rapid transit system, it is legally a [[commuter rail]]road under the jurisdiction of the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA); its trackage between Newark and Jersey City is located in close proximity to [[Northeast Corridor]] trackage and shares the [[Dock Bridge|Newark Dock Bridge]] with intercity and commuter trains. All PATH train operators must therefore be licensed railroad engineers and extra inspections are required. PATH currently uses one class of rolling stock, the PA5, which was delivered in 2009\u20132011.\n\n==History==\n\n==={{Anchor|Early history}}Hudson & Manhattan Railroad===\nThe PATH system predates the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[Early history of the IRT subway|first underground line]], operated by the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]]. The Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (H&M) was planned in 1874, but it was not possible at that time to safely tunnel under the [[Hudson River]]. Construction began on the existing tunnels in 1890, but soon stopped when funding ran out. It resumed in 1900 under the direction of [[William Gibbs McAdoo]], an ambitious young lawyer who had moved to New York from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], and later became president of the H&M.<ref name=\"Fitzherbert\">{{cite web|last=Fitzherbert, Anthony|url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/path/hmhistory.html|title=\"The Public Be Pleased\": William G.

Additionally, all PATH train operators must be federally certified [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers|locomotive engineers]], and the agency must conduct more detailed safety inspections than other rapid transit systems.

When the original Yonge line was built in 1954, Queen station was built with roughed-in infrastructure for the proposed underground streetcar platform. Most of this unfinished portion of the station is inaccessible to the public; it is sometimes referred to as [[Lower Queen]].<ref name=\"TorStar2015-02-27\" />\n\nIn June 1968, one month after Bloor\u2013Danforth extensions to Warden and Islington opened and a few months before construction of the Eglinton to Finch portion of the system was started, the TTC made clear that a [[Queen subway line|Queen subway]] from Roncesvalles to [[Donlands station]] should be the next priority. ''The Toronto Star'' reported on June 12, 1968, that the 17-station, {{convert|12.5|km|adj=on}} line would cost between $150{{nbsp}}million and $200{{nbsp}}million. The TTC acquired land for the corridor on the west side of [[Greenwood Yard]] and still holds the Oakvale Greenspace. By mid-1969, the line was considered to be ready for construction, but was soon considered a lower priority than the Spadina line at the suburban-dominated Metro Council.\n\n===1980s: A new subway line===\nIn the 1980s, the TTC, [[Metropolitan Toronto]] and the [[Government of Ontario]] did several analyses of forecasted urban growth and alternative transportation scenarios for the downtown to Bloor area. In 1982, the Accelerated Rapid Transit Study considered multiple options for a \"radial line\", connecting [[Dundas West station|Dundas West]] and Donlands stations with a U-shape through downtown. This planning continued into 1985, with downtown alignments following King Street, Queen Street, Front Street and the railways to and from Union Station.<ref name=\"Levy Ch 12.1\">Levy, Ch. 12.1</ref>\n\nThe TTC released the [[Network 2011]] plan in 1985, and a Relief Line was one of the three routes proposed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Network 2011 \u2013 To think of what could have been |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5111.shtml |work=Transit Toronto |date=2006-11-10 |accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> As part of the 2011 Network plan, the Relief Line was proposed to run between Pape station on the Bloor\u2013Danforth line, south to Eastern Avenue, and then west to [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]], the [[Rogers Centre]] (then known as the SkyDome) and Spadina Avenue.<ref name=\"DRL\">{{cite web |title=The Downtown Relief Line Proposal |first=Jonathan |last=English |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5113.shtml |work=Transit Toronto |date=2006-11-10 |accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>\n\nThree possible alignments were considered for the westward extension. The least expensive would follow the railway right-of-way past the [[Exhibition GO Station]] and up to the Galt-Weston railway corridor, taking it to Dundas West station. Another alternative would go west of Strachan Avenue along the Oakville Subdivision rail lines to Roncesvalles Avenue, where it would turn north to connect to the Bloor line at Dundas West. The third alignment considered ran along an elevated guideway on Parkside Drive at the edge of [[High Park]] to [[Keele station]].<ref name=\"DRL\" />\n\nThe Relief Line disappeared from transit plans soon after the province delayed approving Metropolitan Toronto's Network 2011 plan.

When the original Yonge line was built in 1954, Queen station was built with roughed-in infrastructure for the proposed underground streetcar platform. Most of this unfinished portion of the station is inaccessible to the public; it is sometimes referred to as [[Lower Queen]].<ref name=\"TorStar2015-02-27\" />\n\nIn June 1968, one month after Bloor\u2013Danforth extensions to Warden and Islington opened and a few months before construction of the Eglinton to Finch portion of the system was started, the TTC made clear that a [[Queen subway line|Queen subway]] from Roncesvalles to [[Donlands station]] should be the next priority. ''The Toronto Star'' reported on June 12, 1968, that the 17-station, {{convert|12.5|km|adj=on}} line would cost between $150{{nbsp}}million and $200{{nbsp}}million. The TTC acquired land for the corridor on the west side of [[Greenwood Yard]] and still holds the Oakvale Greenspace. By mid-1969, the line was considered to be ready for construction, but was soon considered a lower priority than the Spadina line at the suburban-dominated Metro Council.\n\n===1980s: A new subway line===\nIn the 1980s, the TTC, [[Metropolitan Toronto]] and the [[Government of Ontario]] did several analyses of forecasted urban growth and alternative transportation scenarios for the downtown to Bloor area. In 1982, the Accelerated Rapid Transit Study considered multiple options for a \"radial line\", connecting [[Dundas West station|Dundas West]] and Donlands stations with a U-shape through downtown. This planning continued into 1985, with downtown alignments following King Street, Queen Street, Front Street and the railways to and from Union Station.<ref name=\"Levy Ch 12.1\">Levy, Ch. 12.1</ref>\n\nThe TTC released the [[Network 2011]] plan in 1985, and a Relief Line was one of the three routes proposed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Network 2011 \u2013 To think of what could have been |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5111.shtml |work=Transit Toronto |date=2006-11-10 |accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> As part of the 2011 Network plan, the Relief Line was proposed to run between Pape station on the Bloor\u2013Danforth line, south to Eastern Avenue, and then west to [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]], the [[Rogers Centre]] (then known as the SkyDome) and Spadina Avenue.<ref name=\"DRL\">{{cite web |title=The Downtown Relief Line Proposal |first=Jonathan |last=English |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5113.shtml |work=Transit Toronto |date=2006-11-10 |accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>\n\nThree possible alignments were considered for the westward extension. The least expensive would follow the railway right-of-way past the [[Exhibition GO Station]] and up to the Galt-Weston railway corridor, taking it to Dundas West station. Another alternative would go west of Strachan Avenue along the Oakville Subdivision rail lines to Roncesvalles Avenue, where it would turn north to connect to the Bloor line at Dundas West. The third alignment considered ran along an elevated guideway on Parkside Drive at the edge of [[High Park]] to [[Keele station]].<ref name=\"DRL\" />\n\nThe Relief Line disappeared from transit plans soon after the province delayed approving Metropolitan Toronto's Network 2011 plan.
