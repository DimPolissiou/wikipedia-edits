Its onset is usually after age 40, but it can occur at any age.<ref name=\"What is ET?\"/> The cause is unknown. Diagnosis is by observing the typical pattern of the tremor coupled with the exclusion of known causes of such a tremor. \n\nEssential tremor is distinct from [[Parkinson's disease]], which causes a resting tremor; nevertheless, essential tremor is sometimes misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and some have both conditions.<ref name=Abboud/>\n\nTreatments for essential tremor include medications, typically given sequentially to determine which is most effective coupled with which has the least troublesome side effects. ''Clostridium botulinum'' toxin (Botox) injections and ultrasound are also sometimes used for cases refractory to medications.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nIn mild cases, ET can manifest as the inability to stop the tongue or hands from shaking, the ability to sing only in [[vibrato]], and difficulty doing small, precise tasks such as threading a needle. Even simple tasks such as cutting in a straight line or using a ruler can range from difficult to impossible, depending on the severity of the condition. In disabling cases, ET can interfere with a person's [[activities of daily living]], including feeding, dressing, and taking care of personal hygiene. Essential tremor generally presents as a rhythmic tremor (4\u201312 [[Hertz|Hz]]) that occurs only when the affected [[muscle]] is exerting effort. Any sort of physical or mental [[stress (medicine)|stress]] tends to make the tremor worse.<ref name=\"hopkinsmedicine\">{{cite web | title = Essential Tremor Treatment at the Johns Hopkins Movement Disorders Center in Baltimore, MD | publisher = hopkinsmedicine.org | url = http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/movement_disorders/conditions/essential_tremor.html | access-date = October 27, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe tremor may also occur in the head (neck), jaw, and voice, as well as other body regions, with the general pattern being that the tremor begins in the arms and then spreads to these other regions in some people. Women are more likely to develop the head tremor than are men. Other types of tremor may also occur, including postural tremor of the outstretched arms, [[intention tremor]] of the arms, and rest tremor in the arms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Louis ED | title = Clinical practice.

Tremor and disease activity/intensity can worsen in response to fatigue, strong emotions, [[low blood sugar]], cold and heat, [[caffeine]], [[lithium salt]]s, some [[antidepressant]]s, and other factors. Typically, the tremor worsens in \"performance\" situations, such as when writing a cheque for payment at a store or giving a presentation.\n\nParkinson's disease and parkinsonism can also occur simultaneously with ET.<ref name=Abboud/> The degree of tremor, rigidity, and functional disability did not differ from patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Hand tremor predominated (as it did in Parkinson\u2019s disease), and occurred in nearly all cases, followed by head tremor, voice tremor, neck, face, leg, tongue, and trunk tremor. Most other tremors occurred in association with hand tremor. More severe tremors, a lower sleep disorder frequency, and a similar prevalence of other non-motor symptoms also can occur.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryu DW, Lee SH, Oh YS, An JY, Park JW, Song IU, Lee KS, Kim JS | title = Clinical Characteristics of Parkinson's Disease Developed from Essential Tremor | journal = Journal of Parkinson's Disease | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 369\u2013376 | date = 2017-05-16 | pmid = 28409750 | doi = 10.3233/JPD-160992 | url = https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-parkinsons-disease/jpd160992 }}</ref>\n\nWalking difficulties in essential tremor are common.

Diagnosis is by observing the typical pattern of the tremor coupled with the exclusion of known causes of such a tremor. \n\nEssential tremor is distinct from [[Parkinson's disease]], which causes a resting tremor; nevertheless, essential tremor is sometimes misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and some have both conditions.<ref name=Abboud/>\n\nTreatments for essential tremor include medications, typically given sequentially to determine which is most effective coupled with which has the least troublesome side effects. ''Clostridium botulinum'' toxin (Botox) injections and ultrasound are also sometimes used for cases refractory to medications.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nIn mild cases, ET can manifest as the inability to stop the tongue or hands from shaking, the ability to sing only in [[vibrato]], and difficulty doing small, precise tasks such as threading a needle. Even simple tasks such as cutting in a straight line or using a ruler can range from difficult to impossible, depending on the severity of the condition. In disabling cases, ET can interfere with a person's [[activities of daily living]], including feeding, dressing, and taking care of personal hygiene. Essential tremor generally presents as a rhythmic tremor (4\u201312 [[Hertz|Hz]]) that occurs only when the affected [[muscle]] is exerting effort.

They discovered that [[1-Octanol|1-octanol]] reduced tremor and did not have the negative side effects of ethanol.

In the [[1972-73 NBA season]], the Suns joined the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] which is the division that the Lakers play in and ever since then, the two teams have always seen each other a lot in the regular season and sometimes the playoffs. The two teams have met five times in the 1980s where the Lakers won all five playoff series, twice in the 1990s where the Suns won both playoff series, three times in the 2000s where the Suns won two of the three playoff series, and once in the 2010s where the Lakers won it. However, ever since the recent decline of the Lakers and the Suns during the mid 2010s, the two teams haven't met in the playoffs.\n\n==Background==\nThe Lakers were founded as the [[Detroit Gems]] in 1946 before relocating to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] and renaming themselves the Lakers ([[List of U.S. state nicknames|Minnesota's nickname]] is \"The Land of 10,000 Lakes\"). The club won several titles led by [[center (basketball)|center]] [[George Mikan]] in the 1950s before moving to [[Los Angeles]] in 1960.<ref name=\"LH\">[http://www.nba.com/lakers/history/lakers_history_new.html History of the Lakers], nba.com/lakers, accessed April 18, 2007.</ref> In 1972 they won another championship led by center [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and point guard [[Jerry West]].<ref name=\"10greatest\">[http://www.nba.com/history/toptenteams_index.html Top 10 Teams in NBA History] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6E2Bn24ti?url=http://www.nba.com/history/toptenteams_index.html |date=2013-01-29 }}, nba.com/history, accessed April 17, 2007.</ref> After acquiring center [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] in 1975 and point guard [[Magic Johnson]] in 1979, the Lakers built a team that won 5 titles in the 1980s. With the retirement of Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar, they struggled in the 1990s. However, in 1996 the club acquired free agent center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and traded with the [[Charlotte Hornets]] for newly drafted shooting guard [[Kobe Bryant]]. With the two maturing under coach [[Phil Jackson]], the club turned into a contender in the early 2000s and won three straight NBA championships.<ref name=\"LH\"/>However after the loss in the [[2004 NBA Finals]], the Lakers traded O'Neal to the [[Miami Heat]], and decided to build around Bryant. During this time the Lakers began to struggle, only to make the playoffs twice between 2004-2007 and to never get out of the first round. However, during the [[2007-08 NBA season]], the Lakers acquired all-star power forward/center [[Pau Gasol]] from the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] and in the same year they made the [[2008 NBA Finals]] losing to the [[Boston Celtics]] in six games. The Lakers would then proceed to win back-to-back championships after that.\n\nThe Suns were one of two franchises to join the NBA at the start of the 1968\u201369 season, alongside the Milwaukee Bucks from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and were the first major professional sports franchise in the Phoenix market and in the entire state of Arizona. Led by general manager [[Jerry Colangelo]], their early years they were shrouded in mediocrity, but their fortunes changed in the 1970s, where, after partnering long-term guard [[Dick Van Arsdale]] and center [[Alvan Adams]] with [[Paul Westphal]], the Suns reached the 1976 NBA Finals, in what is considered to be one of the biggest upsets in NBA history. However, after failing to capture the championship, the Suns would rebuild around [[Walter Davis (basketball)|Walter Davis]] for a majority of the 1980s until the acquisitions of [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]], [[Dan Majerle]] and [[Tom Chambers]] in 1988. The three players would lead the Suns into the 1990s, and in 1992, the Suns traded for all-star power forward [[Charles Barkley]] who went on to win the MVP award in the 1992\u201393 season and lead them to the [[1993 NBA Finals|finals]], where they eventually lost to the Chicago Bulls in six games. After the Suns traded Barkley in 1996, they then began to trade for and build around point guard [[Jason Kidd]], who led the team during the late 1990s and early 2000s. After the Suns traded Kidd to the Nets for [[Stephon Marbury]] and then traded him to the [[New York Knicks]] a year later, they then decided to sign free agent point guard [[Steve Nash]] and hire coach [[Mike D'Antoni]]. Along with Nash, [[Shawn Marion]], [[Amare Stoudemire]] and D'Antoni, the Suns began to dominate the league with their revolutionizing offense. Despite the fact that they couldn't win a championship, their style of play had a major influence around the league and it changed the way basketball was played.\n\n==Rivalry history==\nThe rivalry began when the Lakers finished the [[1969-70 NBA season]] with a 46-36 record and the second seed while the Suns finished with a 39-43 record and the fourth seed which set up a playoff matchup between the two teams<ref name=\"I\">[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1970.html 1969-70 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1970.html, accessed February 26, 2020.</ref>. The Lakers were led by Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain and [[Elgin Baylor]] while the Suns were led by [[Gail Goodrich]], Dick Van Arsdale and [[Connie Hawkins]]. In Game 1, Elgin Baylor led the Lakers with 32 points, 10 assists and 6 rebounds enroute to a victory. Games 2, 3, and 4 however belonged to the Suns, where they would take a 3-1 lead over the Lakers in a best of seven games. But in the end, the Suns fell short, losing three straight games and getting knocked out in the playoffs.

The rivalry started in the [[1970 NBA Playoffs]] after the Lakers became the second team ever to come back from a 3-1 deficit. In the [[1972-73 NBA season]], the Suns joined the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] which is the division that the Lakers play in and ever since then, the two teams have always seen each other a lot in the regular season and sometimes the playoffs. The two teams have met five times in the 1980s where the Lakers won all five playoff series, twice in the 1990s where the Suns won both playoff series, three times in the 2000s where the Suns won two of the three playoff series, and once in the 2010s where the Lakers won it. However, ever since the recent decline of the Lakers and the Suns during the mid 2010s, the two teams haven't met in the playoffs.\n\n==Background==\nThe Lakers were founded as the [[Detroit Gems]] in 1946 before relocating to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] and renaming themselves the Lakers ([[List of U.S. state nicknames|Minnesota's nickname]] is \"The Land of 10,000 Lakes\"). The club won several titles led by [[center (basketball)|center]] [[George Mikan]] in the 1950s before moving to [[Los Angeles]] in 1960.<ref name=\"LH\">[http://www.nba.com/lakers/history/lakers_history_new.html History of the Lakers], nba.com/lakers, accessed April 18, 2007.</ref> In 1972 they won another championship led by center [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and point guard [[Jerry West]].<ref name=\"10greatest\">[http://www.nba.com/history/toptenteams_index.html Top 10 Teams in NBA History] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6E2Bn24ti?url=http://www.nba.com/history/toptenteams_index.html |date=2013-01-29 }}, nba.com/history, accessed April 17, 2007.</ref> After acquiring center [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] in 1975 and point guard [[Magic Johnson]] in 1979, the Lakers built a team that won 5 titles in the 1980s. With the retirement of Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar, they struggled in the 1990s. However, in 1996 the club acquired free agent center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and traded with the [[Charlotte Hornets]] for newly drafted shooting guard [[Kobe Bryant]]. With the two maturing under coach [[Phil Jackson]], the club turned into a contender in the early 2000s and won three straight NBA championships.<ref name=\"LH\"/>However after the loss in the [[2004 NBA Finals]], the Lakers traded O'Neal to the [[Miami Heat]], and decided to build around Bryant. During this time the Lakers began to struggle, only to make the playoffs twice between 2004-2007 and to never get out of the first round. However, during the [[2007-08 NBA season]], the Lakers acquired all-star power forward/center [[Pau Gasol]] from the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] and in the same year they made the [[2008 NBA Finals]] losing to the [[Boston Celtics]] in six games. The Lakers would then proceed to win back-to-back championships after that.\n\nThe Suns were one of two franchises to join the NBA at the start of the 1968\u201369 season, alongside the Milwaukee Bucks from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and were the first major professional sports franchise in the Phoenix market and in the entire state of Arizona. Led by general manager [[Jerry Colangelo]], their early years they were shrouded in mediocrity, but their fortunes changed in the 1970s, where, after partnering long-term guard [[Dick Van Arsdale]] and center [[Alvan Adams]] with [[Paul Westphal]], the Suns reached the 1976 NBA Finals, in what is considered to be one of the biggest upsets in NBA history. However, after failing to capture the championship, the Suns would rebuild around [[Walter Davis (basketball)|Walter Davis]] for a majority of the 1980s until the acquisitions of [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]], [[Dan Majerle]] and [[Tom Chambers]] in 1988. The three players would lead the Suns into the 1990's, and in 1992, the Suns traded for all-star power forward [[Charles Barkley]] who went on to win the MVP award in the 1992\u201393 season and lead them to the [[1993 NBA Finals|finals]], where they eventually lost to the Chicago Bulls in six games. After the Suns traded Barkley in 1996, they then began to trade for and build around point guard [[Jason Kidd]], who led the team during the late 1990's and early 2000's. After the Suns traded Kidd to the Nets for [[Stephon Marbury]] and then traded him to the [[New York Knicks]] a year later, they then decided to sign free agent point guard [[Steve Nash]] and hire coach [[Mike D'Antoni]]. Along with Nash, [[Shawn Marion]], [[Amare Stoudemire]] and D'Antoni, the Suns began to dominate the league with their revolutionizing offense. Despite the fact that they couldn't win a championship, their style of play had a major influence around the league and it changed the way basketball was played.\n\n==Rivalry history==\nThe rivalry began when the Lakers finished the [[1969-70 NBA season]] with a 46-36 record and the second seed while the Suns finished with a 39-43 record and the fourth seed which set up a playoff matchup between the two teams<ref name=\"I\">[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1970.html 1969-70 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1970.html, accessed February 26, 2020.</ref>.

The numbering system works in the following way:\n# North\u2013South roads have numbers from 41 to 117 and increase from west to east.\n# East\u2013West roads have numbers from 1 to 38A, and then from 151 to 161, and increase from north to south.\n\nEach integer road number is generally one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) apart, with letters occasionally designating roads less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) apart. County roads entering urban areas generally become named roads once they cross a city boundary. Some examples include County Road 101 in [[Woodland, California|Woodland]] being renamed Pioneer Ave. and County Road 102 (also known as [[County Route E8 (California)|County Route E8]]) in [[Davis, California|Davis]] being named Pole Line Road.\n\n===Public transportation===\n* [[Yolobus]] (Yolo County Transportation District) runs buses throughout Yolo County and into [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and [[Sacramento International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yolobus.com/routes/index.php|title=Yolobus Routes|last=Services|first=SIA Professional|website=www.yolobus.com|access-date=2018-03-26}}</ref>\n* The [[University of California, Davis]] and the city of [[Davis, California|Davis]] jointly run [[Unitrans]], a combination local city bus and campus shuttle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unitrans.ucdavis.edu/about/special-service-connections/|title=About {{!}} Unitrans|website=unitrans.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}</ref>\n* [[Fairfield-Suisun Transit]] Line 30 also stops in Davis on its runs between [[Fairfield, California|Fairfield]] (Solano County) and Sacramento.\n* [[Amtrak]] has a [[Davis (Amtrak station)|station in Davis]].\n\n===Airports===\n* [[Yolo County Airport]]\n* [[University Airport]]\n* [[Borges-Clarksburg Airport]]\n* Watts-Woodland Airport\n\n===Port===\nThe [[Port of Sacramento]], now known as the Port of West Sacramento, is an inland port in [[West Sacramento, California]], in the [[Sacramento metropolitan area]].

It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]]. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7 June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n===Response to Skripal poisoning===\nIn response to the March 2018 [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]], British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.<ref name=\"AypwF\" /> Iceland diplomatically boycotted the World Cup.<ref name=\"1CS7B\" /> Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that \"the west are trying to deny Russia the World Cup\".<ref name=\"aXQLQ\" /> The [[Russian Foreign Ministry]] denounced [[Boris Johnson]]'s statements that compared the event to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] held in [[Nazi Germany]] as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism]]\".<ref name=\"0aw0J\" />\n\nThe British [[Foreign Office]] and MPs had repeatedly warned English football fans and \"people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent\" travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\".<ref name=\"qKSXy\" /><ref name=\"WNLwc\" /> English football fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.<ref name=\"sOFhm\" /><ref name=\"XWjIW\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony (2018-06-14) 11.jpg|thumb|Russia received widespread praise as World Cup hosts.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

football|football]] tournament contested by [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] and took place between 14&nbsp;June and 15&nbsp;July 2018 in Russia. It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\nThe 22-member [[FIFA Council|FIFA Executive Committee]] convened in [[Z\u00fcrich]] on 2&nbsp;December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.<ref name=\"WFQKr\" /> Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.<ref name=\"kKxiB\" />\n\nThe voting results were:<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2018 FIFA bidding (majority 12 votes)\n!rowspan=2|Bidders\n!colspan=2|Votes\n|-\n!Round 1\n!Round 2\n|-\n|'''Russia'''\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|9\n|{{yes|13}}\n|-\n|Portugal / Spain\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|-\n|Belgium / Netherlands\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|-\n|England\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|{{no result|Eliminated}}\n|}\n\n===Criticism===\nThe English [[Football Association]] (FA) and others raised concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members. They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and [[Sepp Blatter]] had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.<ref name=\"sRBCC\" /> The 2014 [[Garcia Report]], an internal investigation led by [[Michael J. Garcia]], was withheld from public release by [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]], FIFA's head of adjudication on ethical matters. Eckert released a shorter revised summary instead, and his (and therefore FIFA's) reluctance to publish the full report caused Garcia to resign in protest.<ref name=\"3BhYq\" /> Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. [[Greg Dyke]] called for a re-examination of the affair and [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] called for a boycott of the World Cup.<ref name=\"zt9ZM\" /><ref name=\"2xMiJ\" />\n\n==Teams==\n\n===Qualification===\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification}}\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations\u2014the 209 [[List of FIFA Member Associations|FIFA member associations]] except automatically qualified hosts Russia\u2014applied to enter the qualifying process.<ref name=\"riaYh\" /> [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] were later disqualified before playing their first matches,<ref name=\"zimbabwe\" /><ref name=\"indonesia\" /> while [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] and [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], who joined FIFA on 13&nbsp;May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.<ref name=\"k8fRX\" /> Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.<ref name=\"fifa20150320\" /><ref name=\"hstri\" /> The first qualification game, between [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] and [[Mongolia national football team|Mongolia]], began in [[Dili]] on 12&nbsp;March 2015 as part of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|AFC's qualification]],<ref name=\"45Ip9\" /> and the main qualifying draw took place at the [[Konstantinovsky Palace]] in [[Strelna]], [[Saint Petersburg]], on 25&nbsp;July 2015.<ref name=\"L1urj\" /><ref name=\"crlmz\" /><ref name=\"lzli9\" /><ref name=\"press release\" />\n\nOf the 32&nbsp;nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20&nbsp;countries competed at the previous tournament in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]].

It was the first time three [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four [[Arab world|Arab nations]] (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.<ref name=\"vviY2\" />\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden, and three-time runners-up and third placed in 2014 the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] (for the first time since 2002).

/>\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.<ref name=\":0\" /> Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.<ref name=\"nh0b0\" /> On 15&nbsp;June 2018, [[Diego Costa]]'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;<ref name=\"isPIb\" /> the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16&nbsp;June and resulted in a goal by [[Antoine Griezmann]].<ref name=\"iQyFC\" /> A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.<ref name=\"zeD2b\" /> Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.<ref name=\"neijv\" /> FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.<ref name=\"swBxZ\" />\n\n==Venues==\nRussia proposed the following host cities: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara]], [[Saransk]], [[Sochi]], [[Volgograd]], [[Yaroslavl]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].<ref name=\"b9r6N\" /> Each city was located in [[European Russia]], except [[Yekaterinburg]],<ref name=\"S3sSt\" /> which is located very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"<ref name=\"Z1hqZ\" />\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed [[Podolsk]] stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government. Also, in the capital, [[Otkritie Arena]] was competing with [[VTB Arena|Dynamo Stadium]] over which would be constructed first.<ref name=\"8DESn\" />{{dead link|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29&nbsp;September 2012. The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8&nbsp;billion was spent on hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"VKrDx\" />\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.<ref name=\"Sy4OR\" /> He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".<ref name=\"saakov\" />\n[[File:EstadioCentral2017-01-26.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017]] \nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.<ref name=\"u01d8\" /> On 8&nbsp;October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.<ref name=\"AL037\" /> Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium\u2014the two largest stadiums in Russia\u2014were used most; both hosted seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.

The arena hosted its first match on 21&nbsp;April 2018.\n* Sochi: Fisht Stadium (renovated). This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\n* Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished [[Central Stadium (Volgograd)|Central Stadium]] site, at the foot of the [[Mamayev Kurgan]] memorial complex. It was commissioned on 3&nbsp;April 2018.<ref name=\"j2Lhd\" />\n* Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]]. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7 June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n===Response to Skripal poisoning===\nIn response to the March 2018 [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]], British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.<ref name=\"AypwF\" /> Iceland diplomatically boycotted the World Cup.<ref name=\"1CS7B\" /> Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that \"the west are trying to deny Russia the World Cup\".<ref name=\"aXQLQ\" /> The [[Russian Foreign Ministry]] denounced [[Boris Johnson]]'s statements that compared the event to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] held in [[Nazi Germany]] as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism]]\".<ref name=\"0aw0J\" />\n\nThe British [[Foreign Office]] and MPs had repeatedly warned English football fans and \"people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent\" travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\".<ref name=\"qKSXy\" /><ref name=\"WNLwc\" /> English football fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.<ref name=\"sOFhm\" /><ref name=\"XWjIW\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony (2018-06-14) 11.jpg|thumb|Russia received widespread praise as World Cup hosts.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"
