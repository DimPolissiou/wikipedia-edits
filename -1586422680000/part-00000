In 808 the Danish king [[Gudfred|Godfred]] (Lat. Godofredus) destroyed a competing [[Early Slavs|Slav]] trade centre named [[Reric]], and it is recorded in the Frankish chronicles that he moved the merchants from there to Hedeby. This may have provided the initial impetus for the town to develop. The same sources record that Godfred strengthened the [[Danevirke]], an earthen wall that stretched across the south of the Jutland peninsula. The [[Danevirke]] joined the defensive walls of Hedeby to form an east-west barrier across the peninsula, from the marshes in the west to the Schlei inlet leading into the Baltic in the east.\n\nThe town itself was surrounded on its three landward sides (north, west, and south) by earthworks. At the end of the 9th century the northern and southern parts of the town were abandoned for the central section. Later a 9-metre (29-ft) high semi-circular wall was erected to guard the western approaches to the town. On the eastern side, the town was bordered by the innermost part of the Schlei inlet and the bay of [[Haddebyer Noor]].\n\n===Timeline===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"centre\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size: 95%;\"\n|colspan=1 style=\"padding:0.3em;border-collapse:collapse;background-color:#ccccff\" align=center|based on Elsner<ref>{{cite book | first = Hildegard | last = Elsner | year = 1989 | title = Wikinger Museum Haithabu: Schaufenster einer fr\u00fchen Stadt | chapter = | editor = | others = | pages = | location = Neum\u00fcnster | publisher = Wachholtz | id = | url = | authorlink = }}</ref>\n|-\n|valign=top|'''793'''\n|Viking raid on [[Lindisfarne]] - traditional date for the beginning of the [[Viking Age]].\n|-\n|valign=top|'''804'''\n|First mention of Hedeby\n|-\n|valign=top|'''808'''\n|Destruction of [[Reric]] and migration of tradespeople to Hedeby\n|-\n|'''c. 850'''\n|Construction of a church at Hedeby\n|-\n|'''886'''\n|The [[Danelaw]] is established in [[England]], following Viking invasion\n|-\n|'''911'''\n|The Vikings settle in [[Normandy]]\n|-\n|'''948'''\n|Hedeby becomes a bishopric\n|-\n|'''965'''\n|Visit of [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] to Hedeby\n|-\n|'''974'''\n|Hedeby falls to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n|-\n|'''983'''\n|Hedeby returns to Danish control\n|-\n|'''c. 1000'''\n|The Viking [[Leif Erikson]] explores [[Vinland]], probably in Newfoundland\n|-\n|'''1016-1042'''\n|Danish kings rule in England\n|-\n|'''1050'''\n|The Norwegian King [[Harald Hardrada]] destroys Hedeby\n|-\n|'''1066'''\n|Final destruction of Hedeby by a Slavic army.\n|-\n|'''1066'''\n|Traditional end of the [[Viking Age]]\n|}\n\n===Rise===\nHedeby became a principal marketplace because of its geographical location on the major trade routes between the [[Frankish Empire]] and [[Scandinavia]] (north-south), and between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]] (east-west). Between 800 and 1000 the growing economic power of the [[Vikings]] led to its dramatic expansion as a major trading centre. Along with [[Birka]] and [[Schleswig]], Hedeby's prominence as a major international trading hub served as a foundation of the [[Hanseatic League]] that would emerge by the 12th century.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Smith |first=Jillian R. |date=May 2010 |title=Hanseatic Cogs and Baltic Trade: Interrelations Between Trade, Technology and Ecology |type= |chapter=2 |publisher=University of Nebraska at Lincoln |docket= |oclc= |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/anthrotheses/4 |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe following indicate the importance achieved by the town:\n* The town was described by visitors from England ([[Wulfstan of Hedeby|Wulfstan]] - 9th century) and the Mediterranean ([[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] - 10th century).\n* Hedeby became the seat of a bishop (948) and belonged to the Archbishopric of [[Hamburg]] and [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]].\n* The town minted its own coins (from 825).\n* [[Adam of Bremen]] (11th century) reports that ships were sent from this ''portus maritimus'' to Slavic lands, to [[Sweden]], [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]] (''Semlant'') and even [[Greece]].\n\nA Swedish dynasty founded by [[Olof the Brash]] is said to have ruled Hedeby during the last decades of the 9th century and the first part of the 10th century. This was told to [[Adam of Bremen]] by the Danish king [[Sweyn Estridsson]], and it is supported by three [[runestone]]s found in Denmark. Two of them were raised by the mother of Olof's grandson [[Sigtrygg Gnupasson]]. The third runestone, discovered in 1796, is from Hedeby, the ''[[Stone of Eric]]'' ({{lang-sv|Erikstenen}}).  It is inscribed with [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|Norwegian-Swedish runes]]. It is, however, possible that Danes also occasionally wrote with this version of the [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|younger futhark]].\n\n===Lifestyle===\nLife was short and crowded in Hedeby. The small houses were clustered tightly together in a grid, with the east-west streets leading down to jetties in the harbour. People rarely lived beyond 30 or 40, and archaeological research shows that their later years were often painful due to crippling diseases such as tuberculosis.<ref>{{cite web|author=Consulate General of Denmark in New York |title=Factsheet |url=http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |accessdate=January 14, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113013845/http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |archivedate=January 13, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Yet make-up for men and rights for women provide surprises to the modern understanding.\n\n[[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]], a late  10th-century traveller from [[al-Andalus]], provides one of the most colourful and often quoted descriptions of life in Hedeby. Al-Tartushi was from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] in [[Spain]], which had a significantly more wealthy and comfortable lifestyle than Hedeby. While Hedeby may have been significant by Scandinavian standards, Al-Tartushi was unimpressed:\n:''\"Slesvig (Hedeby) is a very large town at the extreme end of the world ocean... The inhabitants worship Sirius, except for a minority of Christians who have a church of their own there.... He who slaughters a sacrificial animal puts up poles at the door to his courtyard and impales the animal on them, be it a piece of cattle, a ram, billy goat or a pig so that his neighbours will be aware that he is making a sacrifice in honour of his god. The town is poor in goods and riches. People eat mainly fish which exist in abundance. Babies are thrown into the sea for reasons of economy. The right to divorce belongs to the women.... Artificial eye make-up is another peculiarity; when they wear it their beauty never disappears, indeed it is enhanced in both men and women.

He set the town on fire by sending several burning ships into the harbour, the charred remains of which were found at the bottom of the Schlei during recent excavations. A Norwegian ''[[skald]]'', quoted by [[Snorri Sturluson]], describes the sack as follows:\n:''Burnt in anger from end to end was Hedeby[..]''\n:''High rose the flames from the houses when, before dawn, I stood upon the stronghold's arm''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Sagan_af_Haraldi_har%C3%B0r%C3%A1%C3%B0a | title=Sagan af Haraldi har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0a \u2013 heimskringla.no}}</ref>\n\nIn 1066 the town was [[Looting|sacked]] and burned by [[West Slavs]].<ref>{{cite news|author1=Nancy Marie Brown|title=The Far Traveler: Voyages of a Viking Woman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUE9ZFNeCBsC&pg=PT110 |accessdate=6 March 2016|pages=95}}</ref> Following the destruction, Hedeby was slowly abandoned. People moved across the [[Schlei]] [[F\u00f6rde|inlet]], which separates the two peninsulas of [[Angeln]] and [[Schwansen]], and founded the town of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]].\n\n==Archaeology==\n\n===20th-century excavations===\nAfter the settlement was abandoned, rising waters contributed to the complete disappearance of all visible structures on the site. It was even forgotten where the settlement had been. This proved to be fortunate for later archaeological work at the site.\n\n[[File:File Haithabu Wikinger Museum 3 28-03-2010.jpg|thumb|View of the Viking Museum]]\n\nArchaeological work began at the site in 1900 after the rediscovery of the settlement. Excavations were conducted for the next 15 years. Further excavations were carried out between 1930 and 1939. Archaeological work on the site was productive for two main reasons: that the site had never been built on since its destruction some 840 years earlier, and that the permanently waterlogged ground had preserved wood and other perishable materials. After the Second World War, in 1959, archaeological work was started again and has continued intermittently ever since. The embankments surrounding the settlement were excavated, and the harbour was partially dredged, during which the wreck of a [[Viking ship]] was discovered. Despite all this work, only 5% of the settlement (and only 1% of the harbour) has as yet been investigated.\n\nThe most important finds resulting from the excavations are now on display in the adjoining [[Hedeby Viking Museum|Haithabu Museum]].\n\n[[File:Hedebyhouses010.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed houses]]\n\n===21st-century reconstructions===\nIn 2005 an ambitious archaeological reconstruction program was initiated on the original site.

In 808 the Danish king [[Gudfred|Godfred]] (Lat. Godofredus) destroyed a competing [[Early Slavs|Slav]] trade centre named [[Reric]], and it is recorded in the Frankish chronicles that he moved the merchants from there to Hedeby. This may have provided the initial impetus for the town to develop. The same sources record that Godfred strengthened the [[Danevirke]], an earthen wall that stretched across the south of the Jutland peninsula. The [[Danevirke]] joined the defensive walls of Hedeby to form an east-west barrier across the peninsula, from the marshes in the west to the Schlei inlet leading into the Baltic in the east.\n\nThe town itself was surrounded on its three landward sides (north, west, and south) by earthworks. At the end of the 9th century the northern and southern parts of the town were abandoned for the central section. Later a 9-metre (29-ft) high semi-circular wall was erected to guard the western approaches to the town. On the eastern side, the town was bordered by the innermost part of the Schlei inlet and the bay of [[Haddebyer Noor]].\n\n===Timeline===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"centre\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size: 95%;\"\n|colspan=1 style=\"padding:0.3em;border-collapse:collapse;background-color:#ccccff\" align=center|based on Elsner<ref>{{cite book | first = Hildegard | last = Elsner | year = 1989 | title = Wikinger Museum Haithabu: Schaufenster einer fr\u00fchen Stadt | chapter = | editor = | others = | pages = | location = Neum\u00fcnster | publisher = Wachholtz | id = | url = | authorlink = }}</ref>\n|-\n|valign=top|'''793'''\n|Viking raid on [[Lindisfarne]] - traditional date for the beginning of the [[Viking Age]].\n|-\n|valign=top|'''804'''\n|First mention of Hedeby\n|-\n|valign=top|'''808'''\n|Destruction of [[Reric]] and migration of tradespeople to Hedeby\n|-\n|'''c. 850'''\n|Construction of a church at Hedeby\n|-\n|'''886'''\n|The [[Danelaw]] is established in [[England]], following Viking invasion\n|-\n|'''911'''\n|The Vikings settle in [[Normandy]]\n|-\n|'''948'''\n|Hedeby becomes a bishopric\n|-\n|'''965'''\n|Visit of [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] to Hedeby\n|-\n|'''974'''\n|Hedeby falls to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n|-\n|'''983'''\n|Hedeby returns to Danish control\n|-\n|'''c. 1000'''\n|The Viking [[Leif Erikson]] explores [[Vinland]], probably in Newfoundland\n|-\n|'''1016-1042'''\n|Danish kings rule in England\n|-\n|'''1050'''\n|The Norwegian King [[Harald Hardrada]] destroys Hedeby\n|-\n|'''1066'''\n|Final destruction of Hedeby by a Slavic army.\n|-\n|'''1066'''\n|Traditional end of the [[Viking Age]]\n|}\n\n===Rise===\nHedeby became a principal marketplace because of its geographical location on the major trade routes between the [[Frankish Empire]] and [[Scandinavia]] (north-south), and between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]] (east-west). Between 800 and 1000 the growing economic power of the [[Vikings]] led to its dramatic expansion as a major trading centre. Along with [[Birka]] and [[Schleswig]], Hedeby's prominence as a major international trading hub served as a foundation of the [[Hanseatic League]] that would emerge by the 12th century.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Smith |first=Jillian R. |date=May 2010 |title=Hanseatic Cogs and Baltic Trade: Interrelations Between Trade, Technology and Ecology |type= |chapter=2 |publisher=University of Nebraska at Lincoln |docket= |oclc= |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/anthrotheses/4 |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe following indicate the importance achieved by the town:\n* The town was described by visitors from England ([[Wulfstan of Hedeby|Wulfstan]] - 9th century) and the Mediterranean ([[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] - 10th century).\n* Hedeby became the seat of a bishop (948) and belonged to the Archbishopric of [[Hamburg]] and [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]].\n* The town minted its own coins (from 825).\n* [[Adam of Bremen]] (11th century) reports that ships were sent from this ''portus maritimus'' to Slavic lands, to [[Sweden]], [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]] (''Semlant'') and even [[Greece]].\n\nA Swedish dynasty founded by [[Olof the Brash]] is said to have ruled Hedeby during the last decades of the 9th century and the first part of the 10th century. This was told to [[Adam of Bremen]] by the Danish king [[Sweyn Estridsson]], and it is supported by three [[runestone]]s found in Denmark. Two of them were raised by the mother of Olof's grandson [[Sigtrygg Gnupasson]]. The third runestone, discovered in 1796, is from Hedeby, the ''[[Stone of Eric]]'' ({{lang-sv|Erikstenen}}).  It is inscribed with [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|Norwegian-Swedish runes]]. It is, however, possible that Danes also occasionally wrote with this version of the [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|younger futhark]].\n\n===Lifestyle===\nLife was short and crowded in Hedeby. The small houses were clustered tightly together in a grid, with the east-west streets leading down to jetties in the harbour. People rarely lived beyond 30 or 40, and archaeological research shows that their later years were often painful due to crippling diseases such as tuberculosis.<ref>{{cite web|author=Consulate General of Denmark in New York |title=Factsheet |url=http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |accessdate=January 14, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113013845/http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |archivedate=January 13, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Yet make-up for men and rights for women provide surprises to the modern understanding.\n\n[[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]], a late  10th-century traveller from [[al-Andalus]], provides one of the most colourful and often quoted descriptions of life in Hedeby. Al-Tartushi was from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] in [[Spain]], which had a significantly more wealthy and comfortable lifestyle than Hedeby. While Hedeby may have been significant by Scandinavian standards, Al-Tartushi was unimpressed:\n:''\"Slesvig (Hedeby) is a very large town at the extreme end of the world ocean... The inhabitants worship Sirius, except for a minority of Christians who have a church of their own there.... He who slaughters a sacrificial animal puts up poles at the door to his courtyard and impales the animal on them, be it a piece of cattle, a ram, billy goat or a pig so that his neighbours will be aware that he is making a sacrifice in honour of his god. The town is poor in goods and riches. People eat mainly fish which exist in abundance. Babies are thrown into the sea for reasons of economy. The right to divorce belongs to the women.... Artificial eye make-up is another peculiarity; when they wear it their beauty never disappears, indeed it is enhanced in both men and women.

He set the town on fire by sending several burning ships into the harbour, the charred remains of which were found at the bottom of the Schlei during recent excavations. A Norwegian ''[[skald]]'', quoted by [[Snorri Sturluson]], describes the sack as follows:\n:''Burnt in anger from end to end was Hedeby[..]''\n:''High rose the flames from the houses when, before dawn, I stood upon the stronghold's arm''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Sagan_af_Haraldi_har%C3%B0r%C3%A1%C3%B0a | title=Sagan af Haraldi har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0a \u2013 heimskringla.no}}</ref>\n\nIn 1066 the town was [[Looting|sacked]] and burned by [[West Slavs]].<ref>{{cite news|author1=Nancy Marie Brown|title=The Far Traveler: Voyages of a Viking Woman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUE9ZFNeCBsC&pg=PT110 |accessdate=6 March 2016|pages=95}}</ref> Following the destruction, Hedeby was slowly abandoned. People moved across the [[Schlei]] [[F\u00f6rde|inlet]], which separates the two peninsulas of [[Angeln]] and [[Schwansen]], and founded the town of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]].\n\n==Archaeology==\n\n===20th-century excavations===\nAfter the settlement was abandoned, rising waters contributed to the complete disappearance of all visible structures on the site. It was even forgotten where the settlement had been. This proved to be fortunate for later archaeological work at the site.\n\n[[File:File Haithabu Wikinger Museum 3 28-03-2010.jpg|thumb|View of the Viking Museum]]\n\nArchaeological work began at the site in 1900 after the rediscovery of the settlement. Excavations were conducted for the next 15 years. Further excavations were carried out between 1930 and 1939. Archaeological work on the site was productive for two main reasons: that the site had never been built on since its destruction some 840 years earlier, and that the permanently waterlogged ground had preserved wood and other perishable materials. After the Second World War, in 1959, archaeological work was started again and has continued intermittently ever since. The embankments surrounding the settlement were excavated, and the harbour was partially dredged, during which the wreck of a [[Viking ship]] was discovered. Despite all this work, only 5% of the settlement (and only 1% of the harbour) has as yet been investigated.\n\nThe most important finds resulting from the excavations are now on display in the adjoining [[Hedeby Viking Museum|Haithabu Museum]].\n\n[[File:Hedebyhouses010.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed houses]]\n\n===21st-century reconstructions===\nIn 2005 an ambitious archaeological reconstruction program was initiated on the original site.

From 2017, the university started courses offering Bachelor of Business Administration and Bachelor of Arts in Economics in 2017 and [[Master of Science]] (MSc) in Physics, Mathematics and Biotechnology have been started in 2019. [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] and [[Bachelor of Economics]] in separate campus situated in East Delhi.\n\n==History==\n\n===Delhi Polytechnic===\nThe seeds of Delhi Polytechnic were sowed by the Wood and Abbott Committee of 1938. It was established as Delhi Polytechnic in 1941. The technical school was created to cater to the demands of Indian industries. At that time, Delhi Polytechnic offered courses in Arts, Architecture, Commerce, Engineering, Applied Science and Textiles. Walter William Wood, the father of technical education in India, became the founder Principal of Delhi Polytechnic.\n\nThe National Diploma awarded by Delhi Polytechnic was considered an equivalent to the B.E. Degree by the then [[Union Public Service Commission|UPSC]]. B.E. degrees in [[Mechanical Engineering]], Electrical Engineering, [[Chemical Engineering]] and Textile Engineering were awarded to the students under Faculty of Technology, the University of Delhi since 1952. A B.E. degree in Civil Engineering was introduced in 1955. In addition to merit of the qualifying examination, tests and/or interviews were held for the selection of candidates for admission.\n\n=== Delhi College of Engineering ===\nUp till 1962, the college was under the direct control of the Ministry of Education, [[Government of India]]. Since 1963, Delhi Polytechnic was taken over by the then Delhi Administration and Chief Commissioner Delhi was the ex-officio chairman of the college. It later became a college of the Union Territory of Delhi. In 1963, Department of Arts became the College of Arts and Department of Commerce & Business Administration was converted to several institutes of Commerce & Secretarial Practices. Fragmentation of Delhi Polytechnic ultimately left behind an engineering institute alone. In 1962, the college was affiliated with [[University of Delhi]]. In 1965, the Delhi Polytechnic was renamed as Delhi College of Engineering and became the first engineering college of Delhi.\n\nB.E. degree course in Production & Industrial Engineering was started in 1988 while B.E. degree course in [[Computer Engineering]] was started in 1989. B.E. degree level courses were started in Polymer Science & Chemical Technology and Environment Engineering in 1998. Information technology played a vital role during this era and the beginning of new millennium witnessed the introduction of B.E. in Information Technology in 2002. B.E. in Bio-Technology was introduced from the academic session 2004-2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dce.edu/about_dce/history.htm |title=History of DCE |publisher=Delhi College of Engineering, Delhi |accessdate=14 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927050534/http://www.dce.edu/about_dce/history.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nThe Department of Architecture of the Delhi College of Engineering became the [[School of Planning and Architecture]], now a Deemed University and Institution of National importance. The Department of Arts and Sculpture became College of Arts and the Departments of Chemical Technology and Textile Technology were shifted out en-block to mark the beginning of the [[IIT Delhi]] at its new campus at [[Hauz Khas]]. The Department of Commerce was later abolished and the [[Faculty of Management Studies (Delhi)|Faculty of Management Studies]] of the University of Delhi was established by Prof. A. Das Gupta, of DCE.  Delhi Administration established Delhi Institute of Technology (Presently [[Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology]]) in 1985 and the new college was established under the patronage of Delhi College of Engineering. DCE shared its campus with NSIT at Kashmiri Gate campus, although later, NSIT was shifted to Dwarka as a follow-up of the Wood and Abott Committee of 1938.

It was established as Delhi Polytechnic in 1941. The technical school was created to cater to the demands of Indian industries. At that time, Delhi Polytechnic offered courses in Arts, Architecture, Commerce, Engineering, Applied Science and Textiles. Walter William Wood, the father of technical education in India, became the founder Principal of Delhi Polytechnic.\n\nThe National Diploma awarded by Delhi Polytechnic was considered an equivalent to the B.E. Degree by the then [[Union Public Service Commission|UPSC]]. B.E. degrees in [[Mechanical Engineering]], Electrical Engineering, [[Chemical Engineering]] and Textile Engineering were awarded to the students under Faculty of Technology, the University of Delhi since 1952. A B.E. degree in Civil Engineering was introduced in 1955. In addition to merit of the qualifying examination, tests and/or interviews were held for the selection of candidates for admission.\n\n=== Delhi College of Engineering ===\nUp till 1962, the college was under the direct control of the Ministry of Education, [[Government of India]]. Since 1963, Delhi Polytechnic was taken over by the then Delhi Administration and Chief Commissioner Delhi was the ex-officio chairman of the college. It later became a college of the Union Territory of Delhi. In 1963, Department of Arts became the College of Arts and Department of Commerce & Business Administration was converted to several institutes of Commerce & Secretarial Practices. Fragmentation of Delhi Polytechnic ultimately left behind an engineering institute alone. In 1962, the college was affiliated with [[University of Delhi]]. In 1965, the Delhi Polytechnic was renamed as Delhi College of Engineering and became the first engineering college of Delhi.\n\nB.E. degree course in Production & Industrial Engineering was started in 1988 while B.E. degree course in [[Computer Engineering]] was started in 1989. B.E. degree level courses were started in Polymer Science & Chemical Technology and Environment Engineering in 1998. Information technology played a vital role during this era and the beginning of new millennium witnessed the introduction of B.E. in Information Technology in 2002. B.E. in Bio-Technology was introduced from the academic session 2004-2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dce.edu/about_dce/history.htm |title=History of DCE |publisher=Delhi College of Engineering, Delhi |accessdate=14 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927050534/http://www.dce.edu/about_dce/history.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nThe Department of Architecture of the Delhi College of Engineering became the [[School of Planning and Architecture]], now a Deemed University and Institution of National importance. The Department of Arts and Sculpture became College of Arts and the Departments of Chemical Technology and Textile Technology were shifted out en-block to mark the beginning of the [[IIT Delhi]] at its new campus at [[Hauz Khas]]. The Department of Commerce was later abolished and the [[Faculty of Management Studies (Delhi)|Faculty of Management Studies]] of the University of Delhi was established by Prof. A. Das Gupta, of DCE.  Delhi Administration established Delhi Institute of Technology (Presently [[Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology]]) in 1985 and the new college was established under the patronage of Delhi College of Engineering. DCE shared its campus with NSIT at Kashmiri Gate campus, although later, NSIT was shifted to Dwarka as a follow-up of the Wood and Abott Committee of 1938.

In 1787, Bishnupur was united with [[Birbhum district|Birbhum]] to form a separate administrative unit. In 1793 it was transferred to the Burdwan Collectorate. In 1879, the district acquired its present shape with the thanas of Khatra and Raipur and the outpost of Simlapal being transferred from Manbhum, and the thanas of Sonamukhi, Kotulpur and Indas being retransferred from Burdwan.
