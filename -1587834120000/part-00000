Over 32 career games, Gragg totaled 24 career [[reception (gridiron football)|receptions]] with 2 [[touchdown]]s. Born in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], Gragg played [[college football]] for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas Razorbacks]] and was drafted by the Bills in the seventh round of the [[2013 NFL Draft]].\n\nAfter he graduated from [[Warren High School (Arkansas)|Warren High School]] in Arkansas, where he played football as a [[wide receiver]], Gragg committed to the [[University of Arkansas]] where the coaching staff converted him into a tight end. In Gragg's sophomore and junior seasons with the Razorbacks, the team made appearances in [[Bowl Championship Series]] games and defeated the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State Wildcats]] in the [[2012 Cotton Bowl Classic]], which culminated the 2011 season. A knee injury caused Gragg to miss eight games his senior season as the Arkansas team finished with a losing record. Invited to participate in the [[NFL Scouting Combine]], an evaluative competition among prospective NFL players, Gragg ran the fastest [[40-yard dash]] time and had the highest [[vertical jump]] and longest [[broad jump]] among all tight ends in attendance; in the [[draft (sports)|draft]], the Bills chose Gragg with the 222nd overall selection, a pick Buffalo acquired from a trade with the [[St. Louis Rams]].\n\nGragg made his NFL debut for Buffalo on October 13 and played in nine regular-season games during the [[2013 NFL season]]. He then played in 10 games in 2014 and 13 games in 2015 before he missed the entire 2016 season due to injury. He signed with the [[New York Jets]] in 2017, but did not play any regular season games for the team after a preseason injury.

Gragg''' (born June 30, 1990) is a former professional [[American football]] [[tight end]] who played three seasons for the [[Buffalo Bills]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). Over 32 career games, Gragg totaled 24 career [[reception (gridiron football)|receptions]] with 2 [[touchdown]]s. Born in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], Gragg played [[college football]] for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas Razorbacks]] and was drafted by the Bills in the seventh round of the [[2013 NFL Draft]].\n\nAfter he graduated from [[Warren High School (Arkansas)|Warren High School]] in Arkansas, where he played football as a [[wide receiver]], Gragg committed to the [[University of Arkansas]] where the coaching staff converted him into a tight end. In Gragg's sophomore and junior seasons with the Razorbacks, the team made appearances in [[Bowl Championship Series]] games and defeated the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State Wildcats]] in the [[2012 Cotton Bowl Classic]], which culminated the 2011 season. A knee injury caused Gragg to miss eight games his senior season as the Arkansas team finished with a losing record. Invited to participate in the [[NFL Scouting Combine]], an evaluative competition among prospective NFL players, Gragg ran the fastest [[40-yard dash]] time and had the highest [[vertical jump]] and longest [[broad jump]] among all tight ends in attendance; in the [[draft (sports)|draft]], the Bills chose Gragg with the 222nd overall selection, a pick Buffalo acquired from a trade with the [[St. Louis Rams]].\n\nGragg made his NFL debut for Buffalo on October 13 and played in nine regular-season games during the [[2013 NFL season]]. He then played in 10 games in 2014 and 13 games in 2015 before he missed the entire 2016 season due to injury. He signed with the [[New York Jets]] in 2017, but did not play any regular season games for the team. On his [[Twitter]] account, Gragg was described as retired from the NFL as of December 2019. In 2020, the collegiate [[Memphis Tigers football|Memphis Tigers]] football team listed Gragg as an assistant coach.\n\n==Early life==\nChris Gragg was born on June 30, 1990, in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], to Kelvin and Tenita Gragg, both of whom worked as educators.<ref name=\"Arkansas_bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasrazorbacks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=6100&ATCLID=1514875|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203042828/http://www.arkansasrazorbacks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=6100&ATCLID=1514875|archivedate=December 3, 2013 |title=Chris Gragg|publisher=University of Arkansas|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"2014_NFL_Game_logs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/player/chrisgragg/2539202/gamelogs?season=2014|title=Chris Gragg 2014 Game Logs|publisher=National Football League|accessdate=August 15, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Education\">{{cite news|url=http://pbcommercial.com/news/local/gragg-surprises-seark-students-stresses-education|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055043/http://pbcommercial.com/news/local/gragg-surprises-seark-students-stresses-education|archivedate=August 10, 2014|title=Gragg Surprises SEARK Students, Stresses Education|date=March 12, 2014|last=Stokes|first=Phyllis|newspaper=Pine Bluff Commercial|publisher=Stephens Media Group}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Kelvin coached the [[Warren High School (Arkansas)|Warren High School]] football team, and Chris served as the team's [[water boy]] until he was in junior high school.<ref name=\"Chapter 2\">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.buffalonews.com/press-coverage/2013/08/chris-graggs-rookie-journal-chapter-2.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022804/http://blogs.buffalonews.com/press-coverage/2013/08/chris-graggs-rookie-journal-chapter-2.html|archivedate=December 3, 2013|title=Chris Gragg's Rookie Journal: Chapter 2|newspaper=The Buffalo News|publisher=Berkshire Hathaway|last=Grahm|first=Tim|date=August 1, 2013}}</ref> For the Warren squad, Gragg played football as a [[wide receiver]] alongside future NFL players [[Jarius Wright]] and [[Greg Childs (American football)|Greg Childs]].<ref name=\"College_bio\">{{cite news|url=http://arkansasnews.com/2010/08/13/room-for-one-more-gragg-counting-on-big-role-in-offense|title=Room For One More?

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to the Town of Cornwall.  In 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'', incorporated after receiving a franchise to operate a streetcar service.  It started operating the service on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track. In 1897, an additional two cars were purchased.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company.''  In ''1''899 in order to generate additional revenues, the company purchased its first new freight locomotive and started a freight service. It would later purchase another.  The service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other businesses, including the town's post office.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to the Town of Cornwall.  In 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'', incorporated after receiving a franchise to operate a streetcar service.  It started operating the service on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track. In 1897, an additional two cars were purchased.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company.''  In ''1''899 in order to generate additional revenues, the company purchased its first new freight locomotive and started a freight service. It would later purchase another.  The service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other businesses, including the town's post office.

considered spoilers.\" Describe plot without POV speculations.-->\n\nThelma is a lonely and repressed young woman from an ultra-religious Christian family who has lived a sheltered life under the protection of her father, Trond, and disabled mother, Unni. She struggles to make friends and soon after moving to [[Oslo]] to attend university begins to experience unexplained [[epileptic seizure]]s. When she meets another student, Anja, she discovers that her feelings for Anja trigger uncontrollable [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] powers.\n\nWhile undergoing a brain tomography test to find the cause of her seizures, she begins to think about Anja and as she focuses on her, Thelma's power is set in motion and she unconsciously and unwittingly makes Anja vanish into empty space. Distraught and confused by Anja's sudden disappearance, Thelma returns home and soon remembers that when she was a little girl she had a baby brother. Once, when feeling neglected and jealous of the attention given to her younger sibling, and wishing him to be quiet and gone, she involuntarily caused him to [[Teleportation|teleport]] from his crib and reappear underneath the sofa. In a final tragic incident, she caused him to disappear from his bath, and he was found trapped below the ice of a frozen lake by her father. Traumatized, Thelma's mother tried to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge; but instead the failed attempt left her disabled. Thelma had forgotten these events. Realising her utter distress, her parents tell her the truth, which is that she is somehow able to manifest whatever she deeply wants; and that she inherited the same inexplicable ability from her grandmother, who blamed herself for the disappearance of Thelma's grandfather, and was kept sedated in a psychiatric nursing home by Trond. Thelma perceives that her parents had a similar fate in mind for her.\n\nEarlier, while visiting Anja, Thelma recalled how her father once held her hand over a lit candle until it almost burned so that she could feel what Hell's eternal fire was like. She causes the death of her father by telekinetically making him [[Spontaneous human combustion|self-combust]] whilst out boating on the unfrozen lake. Thelma realizes that her power can also restore life when she revives a small dead bird.

considered spoilers.\" Describe plot without POV speculations.-->\n\nThelma is a lonely and repressed young woman from an ultra-religious Christian family who has lived a sheltered life under the protection of her father, Trond, and disabled mother, Unni. She struggles to make friends and soon after moving to [[Oslo]] to attend university begins to experience unexplained [[epileptic seizure]]s. When she meets another student, Anja, she discovers that her feelings for Anja trigger uncontrollable [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] powers.\n\nWhile undergoing a brain tomography test to find the cause of her seizures, she begins to think about Anja and as she focuses on her, Thelma's power is set in motion and she unconsciously and unwittingly makes Anja vanish into empty space. Distraught and confused by Anja's sudden disappearance, Thelma returns home and soon remembers that when she was a little girl she had a baby brother. Once, when feeling neglected and jealous of the attention given to her younger sibling, and wishing him to be quiet and gone, she involuntarily caused him to [[Teleportation|teleport]] from his crib and reappear underneath the sofa. In a final tragic incident, she caused him to disappear from his bath, and he was found trapped below the ice of a frozen lake by her father. Traumatized, Thelma's mother tried to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge; but instead the failed attempt left her disabled. Thelma had forgotten these events. Realising her utter distress, her parents tell her the truth, which is that she is somehow able to manifest whatever she deeply wants; and that she inherited the same inexplicable ability from her grandmother, who blamed herself for the disappearance of Thelma's grandfather, and was kept sedated in a psychiatric nursing home by Trond. Thelma perceives that her parents had a similar fate in mind for her.\n\nEarlier, while visiting Anja, Thelma recalled how her father once held her hand over a lit candle until it almost burned so that she could feel what Hell's eternal fire was like. She causes the death of her father by telekinetically making him [[Spontaneous human combustion|self-combust]] whilst out boating on the unfrozen lake. Thelma realizes that her power can also restore life when she revives a small dead bird. She begins to understand that her supernatural ability is also a gift and uses it to heal her mother, making her able to walk again. Along with the realization that she can summon her power, Thelma is able to finally control it, and brings Anja back to existence. She returns to college, now with Anja as her girlfriend in a guilt-free relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eili Harboe]] as Thelma\n**Grethe Elterv\u00e5g as young Thelma\n* Kaya Wilkins as Anja\n* Henrik Rafaelsen as Trond\n* Ellen Dorrit Petersen as Unni\n\n==Production==\n\n''Thelma'' was produced by [[Thomas Robsahm]] of Norwegian production company Motlys, and co-produced by [[Film i V\u00e4st|Film V\u00e4st]], Filmpool Nord and [[B-Reel]] (Sweden), Snowglobe Film (Denmark), and Le Pacte (France); with financial support provided by the [[Norwegian Film Institute]], [[Swedish Film Institute]], [[Danish Film Institute]], Copenhagen Film Fund, Nordic Film & TV Fund, [[Eurimages]], and [[MEDIA Programme]].<ref name=LePacte>{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Wendy|title=Le Pacte joins Joachim Trier\u2019s 'Thelma'|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/le-pacte-joins-joachim-triers-thelma/5109608.article|website=[[Screen Daily]]|date=21 September 2016|accessdate=7 January 2017}}</ref> The final production [[Film budgeting|budget]]{{efn|The first reported budget was 39 million [[Norwegian krone|NOK]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Joachim Triers Thelma har et budsjett p\u00e5 39 millioner kroner|url=http://montages.no/nyheter/joachim-triers-thelma-har-et-budsjett-pa-39-millioner-kroner/|website=Montages|date=2 June 2016|accessdate=22 September 2018|language=Norwegian|quote=(Joachim Trier's Thelma Has A Budget Of 39 Million Kroner)}}</ref>}} was [[Euro|\u20ac]]5,009,000 (47 million [[Norwegian krone|NOK]], 5.8 million [[United States dollar|USD]]).<ref name=budget>{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Facts & Figures 2017|url=https://www.dfi.dk/files/docs/2018-02/ff2017pdf.pdf|publisher=[[Danish Film Institute]]|page=8|date=February 2018|accessdate=29 June 2018}}</ref> <!-- Differences in the total have been published by various sources.

This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general.\" <ref>(Letter to Hunter at the Royal Society, as above)</ref> Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.\n\nJenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist [[Jemima Blackburn]], a keen observer of bird life, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg. Her description and illustration of this were enough to convince [[Charles Darwin]] to revise a later edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-link=Jemima Blackburn|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|date=2006}}</ref>\n\nJenner's interest in Zoology played a large role in his first experiment with inoculation.  Not only did he have a profound understanding of human anatomy due to his medical training, but he also understood animal biology and its role in human-animal trans-species boundaries in disease transmission.  At the time there was no way of knowing how important this connection would be to the history and discovery of vaccinations.

This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general.\" <ref>(Letter to Hunter at the Royal Society, as above)</ref> Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.\n\nJenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist [[Jemima Blackburn]], a keen observer of bird life, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg.

In Japanese it is known as ''ashi-barai''.\n\n===Illustration in kick boxing===\n\n<gallery>\nImage: balayage_cuill\u00e8re.jpg |'' 'Spoon-type' Sweep''\nImage: Crochetage3.svg |''Using a [[hook kick]]''\nImage: balayage_retourn\u00e9.jpg |''Using a [[Kick|spinning kick]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Ground work==\n[[Image:Knee Push Sweep.webm|thumb|right|Push sweep demonstration]]\nA sweep, when referred to in the context of [[Grappling|ground fighting]], is a technique used to [[transition (grappling)|transition]] from a neutral or inferior [[grappling position|position]] to a dominant position, such as a practitioner moving from in an opponent's [[Guard (martial arts)|guard]] to [[Mount (grappling)|full mount]], hence the alternative term 'reversal' as the dominance of positions have been reversed.\n\n===Push sweep===\nA Push Sweep is one of the [[Sweep (grappling)|guard sweeps]] described in [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]].

It took place on 29 March 1644 and resulted in the defeat of a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] army, which threw [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] onto the defensive for the remainder of the year.\n\n==Campaign==\nEarly in 1644, a Royalist army under [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Lord Hopton]] faced a Parliamentarian army under [[William Waller|Sir William Waller]] in the southern counties of England. After some reverses during the previous December, culminating in the [[Battle of Alton]], Hopton had withdrawn to [[Winchester]] to regroup and recruit. He was joined here by a detachment from the King's main \"Oxford Army\" under the [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Brentford|Earl of Forth]], who unwillingly took command of the army. They resumed their advance eastward early in March.\n\nWaller's army of the \"Southern Association\" had also been reinforced by detachments from the main Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and the London Trained Bands, and was advancing westward from his winter quarters near [[Arundel]].  Forth and Hopton determined to seize [[New Alresford]], thus placing themselves between Waller and London.  They forestalled the Parliamentarian [[cavalry]] under Sir [[William Balfour (general)|William Balfour]], and occupied the town late on 27 March.\n\nOn 28 March, the Royalists advanced cautiously south from Alresford. An advanced guard under Sir [[Sir George Lisle|George Lisle]] occupied an outpost position near [[Cheriton, Hampshire|Cheriton]] as night fell, and reported that the Parliamentarians were retreating.\n\n==Battle==\nThe Parliamentarians had been outmanoeuvred up to this point, and had indeed begun to retreat, but overnight Waller changed his mind and ordered an advance.  As dawn broke, the City of London Brigade occupied Cheriton Wood.  Hopton had moved to Lisle's outpost, and realised that it would have to be hastily withdrawn.  The Royalists retreated to a ridge north of the wood, as Waller advanced.\n\nHopton was determined to recapture Cheriton Wood, and sent forward 1,000 \"commanded\" musketeers under a Colonel Appleyard, supported by a battery of guns.  There was some hot fighting, but the Parliamentarians abandoned the wood.  Forth and Hopton intended to stand on the defensive at this point, but an impetuous infantry commander, [[Henry Bard|Sir Henry Bard]], launched his [[Sir Henry Bard's regiment of Foote|regiment of foot]] against the Parliamentarian left wing horse.  Bard's regiment was overwhelmed and destroyed by a charge from Sir Arthur Haselrig's regiment of horse. (This was not his famed Cuirassier regiment which had been destroyed at Roundway Down some 8 months earlier, instead the regiment had been rebuilt as 'regular' cavalry since September 1643). The Royalist cavalry on the right wing tried to support him, but were forced to make disjointed attacks along narrow lanes and were defeated in turn.\n\nHopton sent the Royalist horse from the left wing under Sir Edward Stawell to make a better prepared attack, but they were also defeated. Haselrig's regiment now attacked the Royalist foot moving up in support, and drove them back.  The Parliamentarians also attacked the Royalist left, which had been denuded of its horse, and regained Cheriton Wood.\n\nThe Royalists fell back to their ridge, but Hopton and Forth realised they could not withstand a deliberate Parliamentarian attack the next day. As evening fell, the Royalists retreated to [[Basing House]],<ref>Newman, p. 49.</ref> having lost many brave cavaliers including their Lieutenant General of Horse: Lord John Stuart, Major General of Horse: Sir John Smith, Sir Edward Stowell and Henry Sandys of the Vyne, grandson of William, Fourth Lord Sandys.<ref>MacLean, p. 143.</ref> In addition to these casualties, Raoul Fleury (c/o of the Queens Regiment) and the aforementioned Sir Henry Bard were both badly wounded.\n\n==Results==\nThe defeat of Forth's and Hopton's army left the King's plans of a thrust into Sussex and Kent in tatters. It also allowed the Parliamentarian armies of Essex and Waller to concentrate against the King at Oxford. The king merged the remnants of Hopton's army into his own at the review held at Aldbourne during April 1644. The infantry was formed into a single brigade under Sir Bernard Astley while most of the cavalry was formed into Sir Humphrey Bennett's brigade, with other remnants joining Lord Wilmot's brigade.\n\nAlthough Charles was able to partly restore the situation later in 1644 by gaining victories at [[Battle of Cropredy Bridge|Cropredy Bridge]] and [[Battle of Lostwithiel|Lostwithiel]], the Royalists could never again resume the offensive in the south of England.<ref>Barratt, p. 209.</ref> The prominent Royalist statesman, the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]], considered the battle a disaster.<ref>Barratt, p. 14.</ref>\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}\n::Barratt, John, ''Cavalier Generals: Charles I and His Commanders during the English Civil War 1642-46'' (2000; 2004)\n::{{cite web |last1=Foard |first1=G |last2=Partida |first2=T |title=Battle of Cheriton 29th March 1644 |url=http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/civil-war/battleview.asp?BattleFieldId=11 |website=UK Battlefields Resource Center |publisher=The Battlefields Trust |accessdate=25 April 2020 |date=2020}}\n::{{cite book |last1=Newman |first1=P.R. |title=Atlas of the English Civil War |date=1998 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9780415196109 |edition=Reprint - Reissue}}\n::{{cite book |editor1-last=MacLean |editor1-first=Sir John |editor2-last=Heane |editor2-first=W.C. |title=The Visitation of Gloucestershire 1623 |date=1885 |location=London}}\n\n==Further reading==\n::{{Cite book|author=Adair, John Eric|year=1973|title=Cheriton 1644: The Campaign and the Battle|publisher=Roundwood Press|location=Kineton, Warwickshire, England|isbn=978-0-900093-19-7}}\n::{{Cite book|author=Gardiner, Samuel Rawson|year=1987|title=History of the Great Civil War, Volume 1 1642&ndash;44|publisher=Windrush Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-900075-00-1}} Note: republished from first edition, Longmans, London, 1886\n::{{Cite book|authorlink = George Nelson Godwin|last=Godwin|first=G.

Recently, many new lines of evidence have been brought to bear on dinosaur [[physiology]] generally, including not only metabolic systems and thermoregulation, but on respiratory and cardiovascular systems as well.\n\nDuring the early years of dinosaur paleontology, it was widely considered that they were sluggish, cumbersome, and sprawling [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] [[lizard]]s. However, with the discovery of much more complete skeletons in western United States, starting in the 1870s, scientists could make more informed interpretations of dinosaur biology and physiology.  [[Edward Drinker Cope]], opponent of [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in the [[Bone Wars]], propounded at least some dinosaurs as active and agile, as seen in the painting of two fighting \"[[Dryptosaurus|Laelaps]]\" produced under his direction by [[Charles R.

Later dinosaurs regarded as predators sometimes grew much larger, but retained the same set of features. Instead of chewing their food, these predators swallowed it whole.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\">{{Cite book\n| author=Norman, D.B. | chapter=Dinosaur Feeding | date=April 2001\n| title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences | publisher= John Wiley & Sons | doi=10.1038/npg.els.0003321\n| chapter-url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/emrw/9780470015902/els/article/a0003321/current/abstract\n| accessdate=2009-09-10\n| isbn=978-0470016176 }}</ref>\n\nThe feeding habits of [[ornithomimosaur]]s and [[oviraptorosaur]]s are a mystery: although they evolved from a predatory [[theropod]] lineage, they have small jaws and lack the blade-like teeth of typical predators, but there is no evidence of their diet or how they ate and digested it.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nFeatures of other groups of dinosaurs indicate they were herbivores. These features include:\n* Jaws that only slightly opened and closed so that all the teeth met at the same time\n* Large abdomens that could accommodate large amounts of vegetation and store it for the long time it takes to digest vegetation\n* Guts that likely contained [[Endosymbiotic]] micro-organisms that digest [[cellulose]], as no known animal can digest this tough material directly<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\n[[Sauropod]]s, which were herbivores, did not chew their food, as their teeth and jaws appear suitable only for stripping leaves off plants. [[Ornithischian]]s, also herbivores, show a variety of approaches. The armored [[ankylosaur]]s and [[stegosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, and are thought to have fed in much the same way as sauropods. The [[pachycephalosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, but their lack of large digestive systems suggests a different diet, possibly fruits, seeds, or young shoots, which would have been more nutritious to them than leaves.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nOn the other hand, [[ornithopod]]s such as ''[[Hypsilophodon]]'', ''[[Iguanodon]]'' and various [[hadrosaur]]s had horny beaks for snipping off vegetation and jaws and teeth that were well-adapted for chewing. The horned [[ceratopsian]]s had similar mechanisms.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nIt has often been suggested that at least some dinosaurs used swallowed stones, known as [[gastrolith]]s, to aid digestion by grinding their food in muscular [[gizzard]]s, and that this was a feature they shared with birds. In 2007 Oliver Wings reviewed references to gastroliths in scientific literature and found considerable confusion, starting with the lack of an agreed and objective definition of \"gastrolith\". He found that swallowed hard stones or grit can assist digestion in birds that mainly feed on grain but may not be essential\u2014and that birds that eat insects in summer and grain in winter usually get rid of the stones and grit in summer. Gastroliths have often been described as important for [[sauropod]] dinosaurs, whose diet of vegetation required very thorough digestion, but Wings concluded that this idea was incorrect: gastroliths are found with only a small percentage of sauropod fossils; where they have been found, the amounts are too small and in many cases the stones are too soft to have been effective in grinding food; most of these gastroliths are highly polished, but gastroliths used by modern animals to grind food are roughened by wear and corroded by stomach acids; hence the sauropod gastroliths were probably swallowed accidentally. On the other hand, he concluded that gastroliths found with fossils of advanced [[theropod]] dinosaurs such as ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'' and ''[[Caudipteryx]]'' resemble those of birds, and that the use of gastroliths for grinding food may have appeared early in the group of dinosaurs from which these dinosaurs and birds both evolved.<ref name=\"Wings2007ReviewOfGastrolithFunction\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wings, O. | year=2007\n| title=A review of gastrolith function with implications for fossil vertebrates and a revised classification\n| journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume=52 | issue=1 |pages=1\u201316\n| url=http://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app52/app52-001.pdf | accessdate=2008-09-10\n}}</ref><ref name=\"WingsSander2007NoGastricMillInSauropods\">{{cite journal\n|author1=Wings, O. |author2=Sander.

But this does not imply that ornithischians could not have had metabolic rates comparable to those of mammals, since mammals also do not have air sacs.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\nThree explanations have been suggested for the development of air sacs in dinosaurs:<ref name=\"SerenoMartinezEtAl2008AvianIntrathoracicAirSacsInNewPredatoryDinosaur\" />\n* Increase in respiratory capacity. This is probably the most common hypothesis, and fits well with the idea that many dinosaurs had fairly high [[metabolic rate]]s.\n* Improving balance and maneuvrability by lowering the [[center of gravity]] and reducing [[rotational inertia]]. However this does not explain the expansion of air sacs in the quadrupedal sauropods.\n* As a cooling mechanism. It seems that air sacs and feathers evolved at about the same time in [[coelurosaur]]s. If feathers retained heat, their owners would have required a means of dissipating excess heat. This idea is plausible but needs further empirical support.\n\nCalculations of the volumes of various parts of the sauropod ''Apatosaurus''' respiratory system support the evidence of bird-like air sacs in sauropods:\n* Assuming that ''Apatosaurus'', like dinosaurs' nearest surviving relatives [[crocodilia]]ns and birds, did not have a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the [[dead space (physiology)|dead-space volume]] of a 30-ton specimen would be about 184 liters. This is the total volume of the mouth, trachea and air tubes. If the animal exhales less than this, stale air is not expelled and is sucked back into the lungs on the following inhalation.\n* Estimates of its [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]]&nbsp;\u2013 the amount of air moved into or out of the lungs in a single breath&nbsp;\u2013 depend on the type of [[respiratory system]] the animal had: 904&nbsp;liters if avian; 225&nbsp;liters if mammalian; 19&nbsp;liters if reptilian.\nOn this basis, ''Apatosaurus'' could not have had a reptilian respiratory system, as its tidal volume would have been less than its dead-space volume, so that stale air was not expelled but was sucked back into the lungs. Likewise, a mammalian system would only provide to the lungs about 225&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;184&nbsp;=&nbsp;41&nbsp;liters of fresh, oxygenated air on each breath. ''Apatosaurus'' must therefore have had either a system unknown in the modern world or one like [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|birds]]', with multiple air sacs and a flow-through lung. Furthermore, an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600&nbsp;liters while a mammalian one would have required about 2,950&nbsp;liters, which would exceed the estimated 1,700&nbsp;liters of space available in a 30-ton ''Apatosaurus''\u2032 chest.<ref name=\"PaladinoEtAlInFarlowBrettSurman1997\">{{Cite book |author=Paladino, F.V., Spotila, J.R., and Dodson, P. |year=1997 |contribution=A Blueprint for Giants: Modeling the Physiology of Large Dinosaurs |editor=Farlow, J.O. |editor2=Brett-Surman, M.K.  |title=The Complete Dinosaur |pages=491\u2013504 |isbn=978-0-253-21313-6 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Ind.}}</ref>\n\nDinosaur respiratory systems with bird-like air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build can sustain.

Modern endotherms maintain a variety of temperatures: {{convert|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in [[monotreme]]s and [[sloth]]s;  {{convert|33|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in [[marsupial]]s;  {{convert|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|38|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in most [[placental]]s; and around {{convert|41|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in birds.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* '''[[Tachymetabolism]]''', i.e. maintaining a high [[metabolic rate]], particularly when at rest. This requires a fairly high and stable body temperature, since biochemical processes run about half as fast if an animal's temperature drops by 10C\u00b0; most [[enzyme]]s have an optimum [[operating temperature]] and their efficiency drops rapidly outside the preferred range.<ref name=\"McGowan11991DinosaursSpitfiresSeaDragonsP133To135\">{{cite book |author=McGowan, C. |title=Dinosaurs, Spitfires and Sea Dragons |year=1991 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/dinosaursspitfir00mcgo/page/133 133\u2013135] |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-20769-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/dinosaursspitfir00mcgo/page/133 }}</ref>\n* '''[[Endotherm]]y''', i.e. the ability to generate heat internally, for example by \"burning\" fat, rather than via behaviors such as basking or muscular activity. Although endothermy is in principle the most reliable way to maintain a fairly constant temperature, it is expensive; for example modern mammals need 10 to 13 times as much food as modern reptiles.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\nLarge dinosaurs may also have maintained their temperatures by inertial homeothermy, also known as \"bulk homeothermy\" or \"mass homeothermy\". In other words, the [[thermal capacity]] of such large animals was so high that it would take two days or more for their temperatures to change significantly, and this would have smoothed out variations caused by daily temperature cycles. This smoothing effect has been observed in large turtles and [[crocodilian]]s, but ''[[Plateosaurus]]'', which weighed about {{convert|700|kg|lb}}, may have been the smallest dinosaur in which it would have been effective. Inertial homeothermy would not have been possible for small species nor for the young of larger species.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" /> Vegetation fermenting in the guts of large herbivores can also produce considerable heat, but this method of maintaining a high and stable temperature would not have been possible for carnivores or for small herbivores or the young of larger herbivores.<ref>{{cite journal\n| author=Mackie, R.I.\n| title=Mutualistic Fermentative Digestion in the Gastrointestinal Tract: Diversity and Evolution\n| journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume=42 | issue=2 | pages=319\u2013326 | year=2002\n| url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/42/2/319 | accessdate=2008-09-12\n| doi=10.1093/icb/42.2.319 | pmid=21708724\n| doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nSince the internal mechanisms of extinct creatures are unknowable, most discussion focuses on homeothermy and tachymetabolism.\n\nAssessment of metabolic rates is complicated by the distinction between the rates while resting and while active. In all modern reptiles and most mammals and birds the maximum rates during all-out activity are 10 to 20 times higher than minimum rates while at rest. However, in a few mammals these rates differ by a factor of 70. Theoretically it would be possible for a land vertebrate to have a reptilian metabolic rate at rest and a bird-like rate while working flat out. However, an animal with such a low resting rate would be unable to grow quickly. The huge [[herbivorous]] [[sauropod]]s may have been on the move so constantly in search of food that their energy expenditure would have been much the same irrespective of whether their resting metabolic rates were high or low.<ref>{{Cite book\n| author=Paul, G.S. | chapter=Cope's rule | page=211\n| title=Morrison Symposium Proceedings: A Special Issue Of The Journal Modern Geology\n| editor=Carpenter, K. |editor2=Fraser, N. |editor3=Chure, D. |editor4=Kirkland, J.I.\n| publisher=Taylor & Francis | year=1998 | isbn=978-90-5699-183-8\n| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=CLEPeg_SjTcC&dq=sprawling+limbs+efficient | accessdate=2008-09-12\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Metabolic options ===\nThe main possibilities are that:<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* Dinosaurs were cold-blooded, like modern reptiles, except that the large size of many would have stabilized their body temperatures.\n* They were warm-blooded, more like modern mammals or birds than modern reptiles.\n* They were neither cold-blooded nor warm-blooded in modern terms, but had metabolisms that were different from and in some ways intermediate between those of modern cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals.\n* They included animals with two or three of these types of metabolism.\n\nDinosaurs were around for about 150 million years, so it is very likely that different groups evolved different metabolisms and thermoregulatory regimes, and that some developed different physiologies from the first dinosaurs.\n\nIf all or some dinosaurs had intermediate metabolisms, they may have had the following features:<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* Low resting metabolic rates\u2014which would reduce the amount of food they needed and allow them to use more of that food for growth than do animals with high resting metabolic rates.\n* Inertial homeothermy\n* The ability to control heat loss by expanding and contracting blood vessels just under the skin, as many modern reptiles do.\n* Two-part circulations driven by four-chambered hearts.\n* High [[aerobic capacity]], allowing sustained activity.\nRobert Reid has suggested that such animals could be regarded as \"failed endotherms\". He envisaged both dinosaurs and the Triassic ancestors of mammals passing through a stage with these features. Mammals were forced to become smaller as [[archosaur]]s came to dominate [[ecological niche]]s for medium to large animals. Their decreasing size made them more vulnerable to heat loss because it increased their ratios of surface area to mass, and thus forced them to increase internal heat generation and thus become full endotherms. On the other hand, dinosaurs became medium to very large animals and thus were able to retain the \"intermediate\" type of metabolism.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\n=== Bone structure ===\nArmand de Ricql\u00e8s discovered [[Haversian canals]] in dinosaur bones, and argued that there was evidence of endothermy in dinosaurs. These canals are common in \"warm-blooded\" animals and are associated with fast growth and an active life style because they help to recycle bone to facilitate rapid growth and repair damage caused by stress or injuries.<ref>Ricqles, A. J. de. (1974). ''Evolution of endothermy: histological evidence''.

Secondary Haversian canals are correlated with size and age, mechanical stress and nutrient turnover.

This system is responsible for replacing old bone with new bone, thereby repairing microbreaks that occur naturally during locomotion.  Without this repair, microbreaks would build up, leading to [[stress fractures]] and ultimately catastrophic bone failure. The size of the nutrient foramen provides an index of blood flow through it, according to the [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation]].  The size is also related to the body size of animal, of course, so this effect is removed by analysis of [[allometry]].  Blood flow index of the nutrient foramen of the femurs in living mammals increases in direct proportion to the animals' maximum metabolic rates, as measured during maximum sustained locomotion.  Mammalian blood flow index is about 10 times greater than in [[ectotherm]]ic reptiles.  Ten species of fossil dinosaurs from five taxonomic groups reveal indices even higher than in mammals, when body size is accounted for, indicating that they were highly active, aerobic animals.  Thus high blood flow rate, high blood pressure, a four-chambered heart and sustained aerobic metabolism are all consistent with [[endotherm]]y.\n\n=== Growth rates ===\nDinosaurs grew from small eggs to several tons in weight relatively quickly.

Bakker obtained his numbers by counting museum specimens, but these have a bias towards rare or especially well-preserved specimens, and do not represent what exists in fossil beds. Even fossil beds may not accurately represent the actual populations, for example smaller and younger animals have less robust bones and are therefore less likely to be preserved.\n* There are no published predator\u2013prey ratios for large ectothermic predators, because such predators are very rare and mostly occur only on fairly small islands. Large ectothermic herbivores are equally rare. So Bakker was forced to compare mammalian predator\u2013prey ratios with those of fish and invertebrate communities, where life expectancies are much shorter and other differences also distort the comparison.\n* The concept assumes that predator populations are limited only by the availability of prey. However other factors such as shortage of nesting sites, cannibalism or predation of one predator on another can hold predator populations below the limit imposed by prey biomass, and this would misleadingly reduce the predator\u2013prey ratio.\n* Ecological factors can misleadingly reduce the predator\u2013prey ratio, for example: a predator might prey on only some of the \"prey\" species present;  disease, parasites and starvation might kill some of the prey animals before the predators get a chance to hunt them.\n* It is very difficult to state precisely what preys on what. For example, the young of herbivores may be preyed upon by lizards and snakes while the adults are preyed on by mammals. Conversely the young of many predators live largely on invertebrates and switch to vertebrates as they grow.\n\n=== Posture and gait ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}\n[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|right | 300px | Hip joints and limb postures.]]\nDinosaurs' limbs were erect and held under their bodies, rather than sprawling out to the sides like those of lizards and newts. The evidence for this is the angles of the joint surfaces and the locations of muscle and tendon attachments on the bones. Attempts to represent dinosaurs with sprawling limbs result in creatures with dislocated hips, knees, shoulders and elbows.<ref>This was recognized not later than 1909: {{cite web|title=Dr. Holland and the Sprawling Sauropods |url=http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612180650/http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |archivedate=12 June 2011 }} The arguments and many of the images are also presented in {{cite book |title=Hot Blooded Dinosaurs |last=Desmond |first=A. |authorlink=Adrian Desmond |publisher=DoubleDay |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-385-27063-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Carrier's constraint]] states that air-breathing vertebrates with two lungs that flex their bodies sideways during locomotion find it difficult to move and breathe at the same time. This severely limits stamina, and forces them to spend more time resting than moving.<ref name=\"Carrier1987LocomotorStaminaInTetrapods\" />\n\nSprawling limbs require sideways flexing during locomotion (except for tortoises and turtles, which are very slow and whose armor keeps their bodies fairly rigid). However, despite Carrier's constraint, sprawling limbs are efficient for creatures that spend most of their time resting on their bellies and only move for a few seconds at a time\u2014because this arrangement minimizes the energy costs of getting up and lying down.\n\nErect limbs increase the costs of getting up and lying down, but avoid Carrier's constraint. This indicates that dinosaurs were active animals because [[natural selection]] would have favored the retention of sprawling limbs if dinosaurs had been sluggish and spent most of their waking time resting. An active lifestyle requires a metabolism that quickly regenerates energy supplies and breaks down waste products which cause fatigue, i.e., it requires a fairly fast metabolism and a considerable degree of homeothermy.\n\nAdditionally, an erect posture demands precise balance, the result of a rapidly functioning neuromuscular system. This suggests endothermic metabolism, because an ectothermic animal would be unable to walk or run, and thus to evade predators, when its core temperature was lowered. Other evidence for endothermy includes limb length (many dinosaurs possessed comparatively long limbs) and bipedalism, both found today only in endotherms.<ref>Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.251.</ref> Many bipedal dinosaurs possessed gracile leg bones with a short thigh relative to calf length. This is generally an adaptation to frequent sustained running, characteristic of endotherms which, unlike ectotherms, are capable of producing sufficient energy to stave off the onset of anaerobic metabolism in the muscle.<ref>Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.252.</ref>\n\nBakker and Ostrom both pointed out that all dinosaurs had erect hindlimbs and that all quadrupedal dinosaurs had erect forelimbs; and that among living animals only the endothermic (\"warm-blooded\") mammals and birds have erect limbs (Ostrom acknowledged that [[crocodilian]]s' occasional \"high walk\" was a partial exception).

These features include:\n* Jaws that only slightly opened and closed so that all the teeth met at the same time\n* Large abdomens that could accommodate large amounts of vegetation and store it for the long time it takes to digest vegetation\n* Guts that likely contained [[Endosymbiotic]] micro-organisms that digest [[cellulose]], as no known animal can digest this tough material directly<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\n[[Sauropod]]s, which were herbivores, did not chew their food, as their teeth and jaws appear suitable only for stripping leaves off plants. [[Ornithischian]]s, also herbivores, show a variety of approaches. The armored [[ankylosaur]]s and [[stegosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, and are thought to have fed in much the same way as sauropods. The [[pachycephalosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, but their lack of large digestive systems suggests a different diet, possibly fruits, seeds, or young shoots, which would have been more nutritious to them than leaves.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nOn the other hand, [[ornithopod]]s such as ''[[Hypsilophodon]]'', ''[[Iguanodon]]'' and various [[hadrosaur]]s had horny beaks for snipping off vegetation and jaws and teeth that were well-adapted for chewing. The horned [[ceratopsian]]s had similar mechanisms.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nIt has often been suggested that at least some dinosaurs used swallowed stones, known as [[gastrolith]]s, to aid digestion by grinding their food in muscular [[gizzard]]s, and that this was a feature they shared with birds. In 2007 Oliver Wings reviewed references to gastroliths in scientific literature and found considerable confusion, starting with the lack of an agreed and objective definition of \"gastrolith\". He found that swallowed hard stones or grit can assist digestion in birds that mainly feed on grain but may not be essential\u2014and that birds that eat insects in summer and grain in winter usually get rid of the stones and grit in summer. Gastroliths have often been described as important for [[sauropod]] dinosaurs, whose diet of vegetation required very thorough digestion, but Wings concluded that this idea was incorrect: gastroliths are found with only a small percentage of sauropod fossils; where they have been found, the amounts are too small and in many cases the stones are too soft to have been effective in grinding food; most of these gastroliths are highly polished, but gastroliths used by modern animals to grind food are roughened by wear and corroded by stomach acids; hence the sauropod gastroliths were probably swallowed accidentally. On the other hand, he concluded that gastroliths found with fossils of advanced [[theropod]] dinosaurs such as ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'' and ''[[Caudipteryx]]'' resemble those of birds, and that the use of gastroliths for grinding food may have appeared early in the group of dinosaurs from which these dinosaurs and birds both evolved.<ref name=\"Wings2007ReviewOfGastrolithFunction\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wings, O. | year=2007\n| title=A review of gastrolith function with implications for fossil vertebrates and a revised classification\n| journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume=52 | issue=1 |pages=1\u201316\n| url=http://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app52/app52-001.pdf | accessdate=2008-09-10\n}}</ref><ref name=\"WingsSander2007NoGastricMillInSauropods\">{{cite journal\n|author1=Wings, O. |author2=Sander.

But this does not imply that ornithischians could not have had metabolic rates comparable to those of mammals, since mammals also do not have air sacs.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\nThree explanations have been suggested for the development of air sacs in dinosaurs:<ref name=\"SerenoMartinezEtAl2008AvianIntrathoracicAirSacsInNewPredatoryDinosaur\" />\n* Increase in respiratory capacity. This is probably the most common hypothesis, and fits well with the idea that many dinosaurs had fairly high [[metabolic rate]]s.\n* Improving balance and maneuvrability by lowering the [[center of gravity]] and reducing [[rotational inertia]]. However this does not explain the expansion of air sacs in the quadrupedal sauropods.\n* As a cooling mechanism. It seems that air sacs and feathers evolved at about the same time in [[coelurosaur]]s. If feathers retained heat, their owners would have required a means of dissipating excess heat. This idea is plausible but needs further empirical support.\n\nCalculations of the volumes of various parts of the sauropod ''Apatosaurus''' respiratory system support the evidence of bird-like air sacs in sauropods:\n* Assuming that ''Apatosaurus'', like dinosaurs' nearest surviving relatives [[crocodilia]]ns and birds, did not have a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the [[dead space (physiology)|dead-space volume]] of a 30-ton specimen would be about 184 liters. This is the total volume of the mouth, trachea and air tubes. If the animal exhales less than this, stale air is not expelled and is sucked back into the lungs on the following inhalation.\n* Estimates of its [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]]&nbsp;\u2013 the amount of air moved into or out of the lungs in a single breath&nbsp;\u2013 depend on the type of [[respiratory system]] the animal had: 904&nbsp;liters if avian; 225&nbsp;liters if mammalian; 19&nbsp;liters if reptilian.\nOn this basis, ''Apatosaurus'' could not have had a reptilian respiratory system, as its tidal volume would have been less than its dead-space volume, so that stale air was not expelled but was sucked back into the lungs. Likewise, a mammalian system would only provide to the lungs about 225&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;184&nbsp;=&nbsp;41&nbsp;liters of fresh, oxygenated air on each breath. ''Apatosaurus'' must therefore have had either a system unknown in the modern world or one like [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|birds]]', with multiple air sacs and a flow-through lung. Furthermore, an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600&nbsp;liters while a mammalian one would have required about 2,950&nbsp;liters, which would exceed the estimated 1,700&nbsp;liters of space available in a 30-ton ''Apatosaurus''\u2032 chest.<ref name=\"PaladinoEtAlInFarlowBrettSurman1997\">{{Cite book |author=Paladino, F.V., Spotila, J.R., and Dodson, P. |year=1997 |contribution=A Blueprint for Giants: Modeling the Physiology of Large Dinosaurs |editor=Farlow, J.O. |editor2=Brett-Surman, M.K.  |title=The Complete Dinosaur |pages=491\u2013504 |isbn=978-0-253-21313-6 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Ind.}}</ref>\n\nDinosaur respiratory systems with bird-like air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build can sustain.

The activity of metabolic enzymes varies with temperature, so temperature control is vital for any organism, whether endothermic or ectothermic. Organisms can be categorized as [[poikilotherms]] (poikilo&nbsp;\u2013 changing), which are tolerant of internal temperature fluctuations, and [[homeotherms]] (homeo&nbsp;\u2013 same), which must maintain a constant core temperature. Animals can be further categorized as [[endotherms]], which regulate their temperature internally, and [[ectotherms]], which regulate temperature by the use of external heat sources.\n\n=== What the debate is about ===\n{{see also|Gigantothermy}}\n\"[[Warm-blooded]]ness\" is a complex and rather ambiguous term, because it includes some or all of:\n* '''[[Homeotherm]]y''', i.e. maintaining a fairly constant body temperature. Modern endotherms maintain a variety of temperatures: {{convert|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in [[monotreme]]s and [[sloth]]s;  {{convert|33|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in [[marsupial]]s;  {{convert|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|38|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in most [[placental]]s; and around {{convert|41|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in birds.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* '''[[Tachymetabolism]]''', i.e. maintaining a high [[metabolic rate]], particularly when at rest. This requires a fairly high and stable body temperature, since biochemical processes run about half as fast if an animal's temperature drops by 10C\u00b0; most [[enzyme]]s have an optimum [[operating temperature]] and their efficiency drops rapidly outside the preferred range.<ref name=\"McGowan11991DinosaursSpitfiresSeaDragonsP133To135\">{{cite book |author=McGowan, C. |title=Dinosaurs, Spitfires and Sea Dragons |year=1991 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/dinosaursspitfir00mcgo/page/133 133\u2013135] |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-20769-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/dinosaursspitfir00mcgo/page/133 }}</ref>\n* '''[[Endotherm]]y''', i.e. the ability to generate heat internally, for example by \"burning\" fat, rather than via behaviors such as basking or muscular activity. Although endothermy is in principle the most reliable way to maintain a fairly constant temperature, it is expensive; for example modern mammals need 10 to 13 times as much food as modern reptiles.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\nLarge dinosaurs may also have maintained their temperatures by inertial homeothermy, also known as \"bulk homeothermy\" or \"mass homeothermy\". In other words, the [[thermal capacity]] of such large animals was so high that it would take two days or more for their temperatures to change significantly, and this would have smoothed out variations caused by daily temperature cycles. This smoothing effect has been observed in large turtles and [[crocodilian]]s, but ''[[Plateosaurus]]'', which weighed about {{convert|700|kg|lb}}, may have been the smallest dinosaur in which it would have been effective. Inertial homeothermy would not have been possible for small species nor for the young of larger species.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" /> Vegetation fermenting in the guts of large herbivores can also produce considerable heat, but this method of maintaining a high and stable temperature would not have been possible for carnivores or for small herbivores or the young of larger herbivores.<ref>{{cite journal\n| author=Mackie, R.I.\n| title=Mutualistic Fermentative Digestion in the Gastrointestinal Tract: Diversity and Evolution\n| journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume=42 | issue=2 | pages=319\u2013326 | year=2002\n| url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/42/2/319 | accessdate=2008-09-12\n| doi=10.1093/icb/42.2.319 | pmid=21708724\n| doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nSince the internal mechanisms of extinct creatures are unknowable, most discussion focuses on homeothermy and tachymetabolism.\n\nAssessment of metabolic rates is complicated by the distinction between the rates while resting and while active. In all modern reptiles and most mammals and birds the maximum rates during all-out activity are 10 to 20 times higher than minimum rates while at rest. However, in a few mammals these rates differ by a factor of 70. Theoretically it would be possible for a land vertebrate to have a reptilian metabolic rate at rest and a bird-like rate while working flat out. However, an animal with such a low resting rate would be unable to grow quickly. The huge [[herbivorous]] [[sauropod]]s may have been on the move so constantly in search of food that their energy expenditure would have been much the same irrespective of whether their resting metabolic rates were high or low.<ref>{{Cite book\n| author=Paul, G.S. | chapter=Cope's rule | page=211\n| title=Morrison Symposium Proceedings: A Special Issue Of The Journal Modern Geology\n| editor=Carpenter, K. |editor2=Fraser, N. |editor3=Chure, D. |editor4=Kirkland, J.I.\n| publisher=Taylor & Francis | year=1998 | isbn=978-90-5699-183-8\n| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=CLEPeg_SjTcC&dq=sprawling+limbs+efficient | accessdate=2008-09-12\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Metabolic options ===\nThe main possibilities are that:<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* Dinosaurs were cold-blooded, like modern reptiles, except that the large size of many would have stabilized their body temperatures.\n* They were warm-blooded, more like modern mammals or birds than modern reptiles.\n* They were neither cold-blooded nor warm-blooded in modern terms, but had metabolisms that were different from and in some ways intermediate between those of modern cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals.\n* They included animals with two or three of these types of metabolism.\n\nDinosaurs were around for about 150 million years, so it is very likely that different groups evolved different metabolisms and thermoregulatory regimes, and that some developed different physiologies from the first dinosaurs.\n\nIf all or some dinosaurs had intermediate metabolisms, they may have had the following features:<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* Low resting metabolic rates\u2014which would reduce the amount of food they needed and allow them to use more of that food for growth than do animals with high resting metabolic rates.\n* Inertial homeothermy\n* The ability to control heat loss by expanding and contracting blood vessels just under the skin, as many modern reptiles do.\n* Two-part circulations driven by four-chambered hearts.\n* High [[aerobic capacity]], allowing sustained activity.\nRobert Reid has suggested that such animals could be regarded as \"failed endotherms\". He envisaged both dinosaurs and the Triassic ancestors of mammals passing through a stage with these features. Mammals were forced to become smaller as [[archosaur]]s came to dominate [[ecological niche]]s for medium to large animals. Their decreasing size made them more vulnerable to heat loss because it increased their ratios of surface area to mass, and thus forced them to increase internal heat generation and thus become full endotherms. On the other hand, dinosaurs became medium to very large animals and thus were able to retain the \"intermediate\" type of metabolism.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\n=== Bone structure ===\nArmand de Ricql\u00e8s discovered [[Haversian canals]] in dinosaur bones, and argued that there was evidence of endothermy in dinosaurs. These canals are common in \"warm-blooded\" animals and are associated with fast growth and an active life style because they help to recycle bone to facilitate rapid growth and repair damage caused by stress or injuries.<ref>Ricqles, A. J. de. (1974). ''Evolution of endothermy: histological evidence''. Evolutionary Theory 1: 51\u201380</ref> Dense secondary Haversian bone, which is formed during remodeling, is found in many living endotherms as well as dinosaurs, pterosaurs and therapsids. Secondary Haversian canals are correlated with size and age, mechanical stress and nutrient turnover. The presence of secondary Haversian canals suggests comparable bone growth and lifespans in mammals and dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Fastovsky 2009, p.258\">Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.258.</ref> Bakker argued that the presence of fibrolamellar bone (produced quickly and having a fibrous, woven appearance) in dinosaur fossils was evidence of endothermy.<ref name=\"Bakker1972AnatomicalAndEcologicalEvidenceOfEndothermy\" />\n\nHowever, as a result of other, mainly later research, bone structure is not considered a reliable indicator of metabolism in dinosaurs, mammals or reptiles:\n* Dinosaur bones often contain lines of arrested growth (LAGs), formed by alternating periods of slow and fast growth; in fact many studies count growth rings to estimate the ages of dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Curry1999OntogeneticHistologyOfApatosaurus\" /><ref name=\"EricksonMakovickyEtAl2004GigantismOftyrannosaurids\"/> The formation of growth rings is usually driven by seasonal changes in temperature, and this seasonal influence has sometimes been regarded as a sign of slow metabolism and ectothermy.

Although drawing conclusions about the earliest archosauriformes from later forms is tricky, because species-specific variations in bone structure and growth rate are very likely, there are research strategies than can minimize the risk that such factors will cause errors in the analysis.\n* Archosaurs split into three main groups in the [[Triassic]]: [[ornithodira]]ns, from which dinosaurs evolved, remained committed to rapid growth; [[Crocodylomorpha|crocodilians' ancestors]] adopted more typical \"reptilian\" slow growth rates; and most other Triassic archosaurs had intermediate growth rates.\n\n=== Metabolic rate, blood pressure and flow ===\n[[Endotherm]]s rely highly on aerobic metabolism and have high rates of oxygen consumption during activity and rest.

Added to this pressure is that required to move the blood through the circulatory system.  It was pointed out in 1976 that, because of their height, many dinosaurs had minimum blood pressures within the endothermic range, and that they must have had four-chambered hearts to separate the high pressure circuit to the body from the low pressure circuit to the lungs.<ref name=BP>{{cite journal|last=Seymour|first=Roger S.|title=Dinosaurs, endothermy, and blood pressure|journal=Nature|year=1976|volume=262|issue=5565|pages=207\u2013208|doi=10.1038/262207a0|bibcode = 1976Natur.262..207S }}</ref> It was not clear whether these dinosaurs had high blood pressure simply to support the blood column or to support the high blood flow rates required by endothermy or both.\n[[File:Foramen blood fow index.jpg|thumb|Foramen blood flow index, derived from the size of the nutrient foramen of the femurs of mammals, reptiles and dinosaurs]]\nHowever, recent analysis of the tiny holes in fossil leg bones of dinosaurs provides a gauge for blood flow rate and hence metabolic rate.<ref name=foramen>{{cite journal|last=Seymour|first=Roger S.|author2=Smith, Sarah L |author3=White, Craig R. |author4=Henderson, Donald M. |author5= Schwarz-Wings, Daniela |title=Blood flow to long bones indicates activity metabolism in mammals, reptiles and dinosaurs|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|year=2012|volume=279|issue=1728|pages=451\u2013456|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.0968|pmid=21733896|pmc=3234558}}</ref> The holes are called nutrient foramina, and the nutrient artery is the major blood vessel passing through to the interior of the bone, where it branches into tiny vessels of the [[Haversian canal]] system.  This system is responsible for replacing old bone with new bone, thereby repairing microbreaks that occur naturally during locomotion.  Without this repair, microbreaks would build up, leading to [[stress fractures]] and ultimately catastrophic bone failure. The size of the nutrient foramen provides an index of blood flow through it, according to the [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation]].  The size is also related to the body size of animal, of course, so this effect is removed by analysis of [[allometry]].  Blood flow index of the nutrient foramen of the femurs in living mammals increases in direct proportion to the animals' maximum metabolic rates, as measured during maximum sustained locomotion.  Mammalian blood flow index is about 10 times greater than in [[ectotherm]]ic reptiles.  Ten species of fossil dinosaurs from five taxonomic groups reveal indices even higher than in mammals, when body size is accounted for, indicating that they were highly active, aerobic animals.  Thus high blood flow rate, high blood pressure, a four-chambered heart and sustained aerobic metabolism are all consistent with [[endotherm]]y.\n\n=== Growth rates ===\nDinosaurs grew from small eggs to several tons in weight relatively quickly.

Secondly, the production of bone may not have been continuous in areas near the extremities of limbs&nbsp;\u2013 in [[allosaur]] skeketons lines of arrested growth (\"LAGs\"; rather like [[growth ring]]s) are sparse or absent in large limb bones but common in the fingers and toes. While there is no absolute proof that LAGs are temperature-related, they could mark times when the extremities were so cool that the bones ceased to grow. If so, the data about oxygen isotope ratios would be incomplete, especially for times when the extremities were coolest. Oxygen isotope ratios may be an unreliable method of estimating temperatures if it cannot be shown that bone growth was equally continuous in all parts of the animal.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\n=== Predator\u2013prey ratios ===\n[[Robert T.

And since the earliest dinosaurs (e.g. ''[[Staurikosaurus]]'', ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'') were predators, all dinosaurs must have been warm-blooded.\n\nThis argument was criticized on several grounds and is no longer taken seriously (the following list of criticisms is far from exhaustive):<ref name=\"FastovskyWeishampelSibbick2005EvolutionAndExtinctionOfDinosaurs\">{{cite book |author=Fastovsky, D.E., Weishampel, D.B., and Sibbick, J. |title=The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs\n|year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-81172-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M8nt10bkovIC&pg=PA371&lpg=PA371&dq=dinosaur+predator+prey+ratio }}</ref><ref name=\"Farlow1980PredatorPreyBiomassRatios\">{{Cite book |author=Farlow, J.O. |year=1980 |chapter=Predator/prey biomass ratios, community food webs and dinosaur physiology |editor=Thomas, R.D.K. |editor2=Olson, E.C. |title=A cold look at the warm-blooded dinosaurs |pages=55\u201383 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |location=Boulder, CO |chapter-url=http://bio.fsu.edu/~amarquez/Evolutionary%20Morphology%20fall%202004/Farlow/Predator-Prey%20biomass%20ratios,%20community%20food%20webs%20and%20dinosaur%20physiology.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217091538/http://bio.fsu.edu/~amarquez/Evolutionary%20Morphology%20fall%202004/Farlow/Predator-Prey%20biomass%20ratios%2C%20community%20food%20webs%20and%20dinosaur%20physiology.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* Estimates of dinosaur weights vary widely, and even a small variation can make a large difference to the calculated predator\u2013prey ratio.\n* His [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] may not have been representative. Bakker obtained his numbers by counting museum specimens, but these have a bias towards rare or especially well-preserved specimens, and do not represent what exists in fossil beds. Even fossil beds may not accurately represent the actual populations, for example smaller and younger animals have less robust bones and are therefore less likely to be preserved.\n* There are no published predator\u2013prey ratios for large ectothermic predators, because such predators are very rare and mostly occur only on fairly small islands. Large ectothermic herbivores are equally rare. So Bakker was forced to compare mammalian predator\u2013prey ratios with those of fish and invertebrate communities, where life expectancies are much shorter and other differences also distort the comparison.\n* The concept assumes that predator populations are limited only by the availability of prey. However other factors such as shortage of nesting sites, cannibalism or predation of one predator on another can hold predator populations below the limit imposed by prey biomass, and this would misleadingly reduce the predator\u2013prey ratio.\n* Ecological factors can misleadingly reduce the predator\u2013prey ratio, for example: a predator might prey on only some of the \"prey\" species present;  disease, parasites and starvation might kill some of the prey animals before the predators get a chance to hunt them.\n* It is very difficult to state precisely what preys on what. For example, the young of herbivores may be preyed upon by lizards and snakes while the adults are preyed on by mammals. Conversely the young of many predators live largely on invertebrates and switch to vertebrates as they grow.\n\n=== Posture and gait ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}\n[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|right | 300px | Hip joints and limb postures.]]\nDinosaurs' limbs were erect and held under their bodies, rather than sprawling out to the sides like those of lizards and newts. The evidence for this is the angles of the joint surfaces and the locations of muscle and tendon attachments on the bones. Attempts to represent dinosaurs with sprawling limbs result in creatures with dislocated hips, knees, shoulders and elbows.<ref>This was recognized not later than 1909: {{cite web|title=Dr. Holland and the Sprawling Sauropods |url=http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612180650/http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |archivedate=12 June 2011 }} The arguments and many of the images are also presented in {{cite book |title=Hot Blooded Dinosaurs |last=Desmond |first=A. |authorlink=Adrian Desmond |publisher=DoubleDay |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-385-27063-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Carrier's constraint]] states that air-breathing vertebrates with two lungs that flex their bodies sideways during locomotion find it difficult to move and breathe at the same time. This severely limits stamina, and forces them to spend more time resting than moving.<ref name=\"Carrier1987LocomotorStaminaInTetrapods\" />\n\nSprawling limbs require sideways flexing during locomotion (except for tortoises and turtles, which are very slow and whose armor keeps their bodies fairly rigid). However, despite Carrier's constraint, sprawling limbs are efficient for creatures that spend most of their time resting on their bellies and only move for a few seconds at a time\u2014because this arrangement minimizes the energy costs of getting up and lying down.\n\nErect limbs increase the costs of getting up and lying down, but avoid Carrier's constraint. This indicates that dinosaurs were active animals because [[natural selection]] would have favored the retention of sprawling limbs if dinosaurs had been sluggish and spent most of their waking time resting. An active lifestyle requires a metabolism that quickly regenerates energy supplies and breaks down waste products which cause fatigue, i.e., it requires a fairly fast metabolism and a considerable degree of homeothermy.\n\nAdditionally, an erect posture demands precise balance, the result of a rapidly functioning neuromuscular system. This suggests endothermic metabolism, because an ectothermic animal would be unable to walk or run, and thus to evade predators, when its core temperature was lowered. Other evidence for endothermy includes limb length (many dinosaurs possessed comparatively long limbs) and bipedalism, both found today only in endotherms.<ref>Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.251.</ref> Many bipedal dinosaurs possessed gracile leg bones with a short thigh relative to calf length. This is generally an adaptation to frequent sustained running, characteristic of endotherms which, unlike ectotherms, are capable of producing sufficient energy to stave off the onset of anaerobic metabolism in the muscle.<ref>Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.252.</ref>\n\nBakker and Ostrom both pointed out that all dinosaurs had erect hindlimbs and that all quadrupedal dinosaurs had erect forelimbs; and that among living animals only the endothermic (\"warm-blooded\") mammals and birds have erect limbs (Ostrom acknowledged that [[crocodilian]]s' occasional \"high walk\" was a partial exception).

In living birds and mammals, water loss is limited by pulling moisture out of exhaled air with mucous-covered respiratory turbinates, tissue-covered bony sheets in the nasal cavity. Several dinosaurs have olfactory turbinates, used for smell, but none have yet been identified with respiratory turbinates.<ref name=\"Fastovsky 2009, p.255\">Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.255.</ref>\n\nBecause endothermy allows refined neuromuscular control, and because brain matter requires large amounts of energy to sustain, some speculate that increased brain size indicates increased activity and, thus, endothermy. The encephalization quotient (EQ) of dinosaurs, a measure of brain size calculated using brain endocasts, varies on a spectrum from bird-like to reptile-like. Using EQ alone, coelosaurs appear to have been as active as living mammals, while theropods and ornithopods fall somewhere between mammals and reptiles, and other dinosaurs resemble reptiles.<ref name=\"Fastovsky 2009, p.255\"/>\n\nA study published by Roger Seymour in 2013 added more support to the idea that dinosaurs were endothermic. After studying saltwater crocodiles, Seymour found that even if their large sizes could provide stable and high body temperatures, during activity the crocodile's ectothermic metabolism provided less aerobic abilities and generate only 14% of the total muscle power of a similar sized endothermic mammal before full fatigue.

Mishra accounts for the resurgence of reactionary and right-wing political movements in the late 2010s. He argues that nationalist, isolationist, and chauvinist movements, ranging from terror groups such as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] to political movements such as [[Brexit]], have emerged in response to the [[globalization]] and normalization of [[Western world|Western]] ideals such as [[individualism]], [[capitalism]], and [[secularism]].\n\n==Thesis==\nMishra notes that disorder and violence naturally accompanied the coming of [[industrial capitalism]] in the Western world, citing events such as the [[French Revolution]], the [[Revolutions of 1848]], and [[World war#The First World War and the Second World War|two World Wars]]. He argues that the rest of world is now undergoing that same series of shocks, and that new tensions resulting from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] are not yet resolved even in Europe. He criticizes the view that early twentieth-century strife was an aberration interrupting a long history of steady progress and increasing prosperity, instead arguing that the disorder is endemic to modernity.  In the first half of the book Mishra dwells on the dispute between philosophers [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who lived during the eighteenth century when Enlightenment ideals and economic, political, and social liberalism began gaining momentum in Europe. According to Mishra, Rousseau was among those who best anticipated the problems modernity would bring: rootlessness, competition, and materialism.\n\nMishra presents this theory in opposition to historical theories that tacitly ascribe mostly positive attributes to modern liberalism such as [[Francis Fukuyama|Fukuyama's]] [[The End of History and the Last Man|''The End of History'']], which argues that [[liberal democracy]] has irrevocably become a global ideal, and  [[Samuel P.
