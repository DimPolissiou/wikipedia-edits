Its economy was heavily [[Plantation economy|plantation-based]], centered mostly on the cultivation of tobacco. The need for cheap labor led to a rapid expansion of indentured servants, penal labor, and African slaves. In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line|settlement]] of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the [[American Revolution]], and by 1776 its delegates signed the [[Declaration of Independence (U.S.)|Declaration of Independence]]. Many of its citizens subsequently played [[Maryland in the American Revolution|key political and military roles in the war]]. In 1790, the state ceded land for the establishment of the U.S. capital of [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nAlthough then a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]], Maryland [[Border states (American Civil War)|remained in the Union]] during the [[American Civil War]], its strategic location giving it [[Maryland in the American Civil War|a significant role in the conflict]]. After the war, Maryland took part in the [[Industrial Revolution]], driven by its seaports, railroad networks, and mass immigration from Europe. Since the Second World War, the state's population has grown rapidly, to approximately six million residents, and it is among the most densely populated U.S. states. {{as of|2015}}, Maryland had the [[List of U.S. states by income|highest median household income]] of any state, owing in large part to its close proximity to [[Washington, D.C.]] and a highly diversified economy spanning manufacturing, services, higher education, and biotechnology.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://proximityone.com/stmhi0910.htm\n|title=State Median Household Income Patterns: 1990\u20132010\n|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau\n|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref> The state's central role in U.S. history is reflected by its hosting of some of the [[List of U.S. National Historic Landmarks by state|highest numbers of historic landmarks]] per capita.\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{See also|List of islands of Maryland|List of rivers of Maryland}}\n[[File:MDGeoReg.PNG|thumb|left|upright=2.05|text-top|Physical regions of Maryland]]\n\nMaryland has an area of {{convert|12,406.68|sqmi|km2}} and is comparable in overall area with [[Belgium]] [{{convert|11787|mi2}}].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/be.html\n|title=Belgium\n|accessdate=May 15, 2008\n|date=May 15, 2008\n|website=CIA World Factbook\n|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency\n|quote=Area\u2014comparative: about the size of Maryland\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710084134/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/be.html\n|archivedate=July 10, 2016\n|df=mdy\n}}</ref> It is the 42nd largest and 9th smallest state and is closest in size to the state of [[Hawaii]] [{{convert|10930.98|mi2}}], the next smaller state.

It ranges from sandy [[dunes]] dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large [[Taxodium|bald cypress]] near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Region]], and [[pine]] groves in the [[List of mountains in Maryland|Maryland mountains]] to the west.\n\n[[File:Deep Creek Lake Maryland Panoramic View.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Western Maryland is known for its heavily forested mountains.

The mid-portion of this border is interrupted by [[District of Columbia]], which sits on land that was originally part of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] counties and including the town of [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown, Maryland]]. This land was ceded to the United States Federal Government in 1790 to form the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. (The [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] gave land south of the Potomac, including the town of [[Alexandria, Virginia]], however Virginia retroceded its portion in 1846). The [[Chesapeake Bay]] nearly bisects the state and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the ''[[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]]''.\n[[File:Patapsco fg01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Typical freshwater river above the tidal zone. The [[Patapsco River]] includes the famous [[Thomas Viaduct]] and is part of the [[Patapsco Valley State Park]].

So prominent is the Chesapeake in Maryland's geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state's official nickname to the \"Bay State\", a nickname that has been used by [[Massachusetts]] for decades.\n\nThe highest point in Maryland, with an elevation of {{convert|3360|ft|m}}, is [[Backbone Mountain|Hoye Crest on Backbone Mountain]], in the southwest corner of [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]], near the border with West Virginia, and near the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River.

This geographical curiosity makes Maryland the narrowest state,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} bordered by the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] to the north, and the northwards-arching [[Potomac River]] to the south.\n\nPortions of Maryland are included in various official and unofficial geographic regions.

Nearly half the black population was free before the war, and some had accumulated property. Half the population lived in cities. Literacy was high among blacks and, as Democrats crafted means to exclude them, suffrage campaigns helped reach blacks and teach them how to resist.<ref name=\"tuck\"/> Whites did impose [[racial segregation]] in public facilities and [[Jim Crow]] laws, which effectively lasted until passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.\n\nBaltimore grew significantly during the [[Industrial Revolution]], due in large part to its seaport and good railroad connections, attracting European immigrant labor. Many manufacturing businesses were established in the Baltimore area after the Civil War. Baltimore businessmen, including [[Johns Hopkins]], [[Enoch Pratt]], [[George Peabody]], and [[Henry Walters]], founded notable city institutions that bear their names, including a university, library, music school and art museum.\n\nCumberland was Maryland's second-largest city in the 19th century. Nearby supplies of natural resources along with railroads fostered its growth into a major manufacturing center.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11374/ |title = Bird's Eye View of Cumberland, Maryland 1906 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1906 |access-date = July 22, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n\n{{original research|section|date=May 2014}}\n\n====Early 20th century====\n\nThe [[Progressive Era]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought political reforms. In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from \"assisting\" voters; initiated [[primary election]]s to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols, which discouraged the [[illiterate]] from participating. These measures worked against ill-educated whites and blacks. Blacks resisted such efforts, with suffrage groups conducting voter education.\nBlacks defeated three efforts to disfranchise them, making alliances with immigrants to resist various Democratic campaigns.<ref name=\"tuck\"/> Disfranchising bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911 were rebuffed, in large part because of black opposition. Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15%, and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants.<ref name=\"tuck\"/>\n\nThe Progressive Era also brought reforms in working conditions for Maryland's labor force. In 1902 the state regulated conditions in [[Mining|mines]]; outlawed [[child labor]]ers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first [[workers' compensation]] law. The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910.\n\nThe [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904 burned for more than 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks. More than 1,231 [[firefighter]]s worked to bring the blaze under control.\n[[File:Rubble_of_the_Great_Baltimore_Fire.jpg|thumb|Ruin left by the [[Great Baltimore Fire]]]]\nWith the nation's [[World War I#Entry of the United States|entry into World War I]] in 1917, new military bases such as [[Fort George G. Meade|Camp Meade]], the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and the [[Edgewood Arsenal]] were established. Existing facilities, including [[Fort McHenry]], were greatly expanded.\n\nAfter Georgia congressman [[William D. Upshaw]] criticized Maryland openly in 1923 for not passing [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] laws, ''Baltimore Sun'' editor Hamilton Owens coined the \"Free State\" nickname for Maryland in that context, which was popularized by [[H.

Beginning in the 1960s, as suburban growth took hold around Washington DC and Baltimore, the state began to take on a more mid-Atlantic culture as opposed to the traditionally Southern and Tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state. Agricultural tracts gave way to residential communities, some of them carefully planned such as [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]], [[St. Charles, Maryland|St. Charles]], and [[Montgomery Village, Maryland|Montgomery Village]]. Concurrently the [[Interstate Highway System]] was built throughout the state, most notably [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]], and the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]], altering travel patterns. In 1952 the eastern and western halves of Maryland were linked for the first time by the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]], which replaced a nearby [[ferry]] service.<ref name=\"baybridge.com-history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baybridge.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=|title=William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bay Bridge\u2014History|publisher=baybridge.com|accessdate=February 5, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701104741/http://www.baybridge.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=|archive-date=July 1, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMaryland's regions experienced economic changes following WWII. Heavy manufacturing declined in Baltimore. In Maryland's four westernmost counties, industrial, railroad, and coal mining jobs declined. On the lower [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], family farms were bought up by major concerns and large-scale poultry farms and vegetable farming became prevalent. In Southern Maryland, tobacco farming nearly vanished due to suburban development and a state tobacco buy-out program in the 1990s.\n\nIn an effort to reverse depopulation due to the loss of working-class industries, Baltimore initiated [[urban renewal]] projects in the 1960s with [[Charles Center]] and the [[Baltimore World Trade Center]]. Some resulted in the break-up of intact residential neighborhoods, producing social volatility, and some older residential areas around the harbor have had units renovated and have become popular with new populations.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{See also|List of counties in Maryland|List of incorporated places in Maryland|List of census-designated places in Maryland}}\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 319728\n|1800= 341548\n|1810= 380546\n|1820= 407350\n|1830= 447040\n|1840= 470019\n|1850= 583034\n|1860= 687049\n|1870= 780894\n|1880= 934943\n|1890= 1042390\n|1900= 1188044\n|1910= 1295346\n|1920= 1449661\n|1930= 1631526\n|1940= 1821244\n|1950= 2343001\n|1960= 3100689\n|1970= 3922399\n|1980= 4216975\n|1990= 4781468\n|2000= 5296486\n|2010= 5773552\n|estimate= 6045680\n|estyear= 2019\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=Source: 1910\u20132010<ref>{{cite web|author=Resident Population Data|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|title=Resident Population Data\u20142010 Census|publisher=2010.census.gov|accessdate=December 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118011236/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|archivedate=November 18, 2011|df=mdy}}</ref><br>2018 estimate<ref name=\"PopEstUS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/md,US/PST045218|title=QuickFacts Maryland; United States|format=|website=2018 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=February 7, 2019|accessdate=February 7, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Map of maryland counties.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[List of counties in Maryland|Maryland's counties]]]]\n\nThe [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Maryland was 6,042,718 on July 1, 2018, a 4.71% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]] and an increase of 2,962, from the prior year.

Historically, these and many other Maryland cities developed along the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]], the line along which rivers, brooks, and streams are interrupted by rapids and/or waterfalls. Maryland's capital city, [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], is one exception to this pattern, since it lies along the banks of the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]], close to where it empties into the [[Chesapeake Bay]].\n\nThe Eastern Shore is less populous and more rural, as are the counties of western Maryland. The two westernmost counties of Maryland, [[Allegany County, Maryland|Allegany]] and [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett]], are mountainous and sparsely populated, resembling West Virginia and [[Appalachia]] more than they do the rest of the state. Both eastern and western Maryland are, however, dotted with cities of regional importance, such as [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]], [[Princess Anne, Maryland|Princess Anne]], and [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]] on the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] and [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], [[Frostburg, Maryland|Frostburg]], and [[Hancock, Maryland|Hancock]] in [[Western Maryland]].\nSouthern Maryland is still somewhat rural, but suburbanization from Washington, D.C. has encroached significantly since the 1960s; important local population centers include [[Lexington Park, Maryland|Lexington Park]], [[Prince Frederick, Maryland|Prince Frederick]], and [[Waldorf, Maryland|Waldorf]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P1000II5.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&Client=EPA&Index=2000+Thru+2005&Docs=&Query=&Time=&EndTime=&SearchMethod=1&TocRestrict=n&Toc=&TocEntry=&QField=&QFieldYear=&QFieldMonth=&QFieldDay=&IntQFieldOp=0&ExtQFieldOp=0&XmlQuery=&File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C00thru05%5CTxt%5C00000014%5CP1000II5.txt&User=ANONYMOUS&Password=anonymous&SortMethod=h%7C-&MaximumDocuments=1&FuzzyDegree=0&ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&Display=hpfr&DefSeekPage=x&SearchBack=ZyActionL&Back=ZyActionS&BackDesc=Results%20page&MaximumPages=1&ZyEntry=1&SeekPage=x&ZyPURL | title=Calvert County, Maryland's Success in Controlling Sprawl | publisher=Environmental Protection Agency | accessdate=September 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/growth/part1/southmd.htm | title=On Edge | work=The Washington Post | date=February 16, 1997 | accessdate=September 3, 2016 | author=Shields, Todd}}</ref>\n\n{{Largest cities of Maryland}}\n\n===Ancestry===\n\n{{Pie chart\n | caption= Racial Makeup of Maryland excluding Hispanics from racial categories (2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=B03002&tid=ACSDT1Y2018.B03002&lastDisplayedRow=20&hidePreview=true&vintage=2018&layer=county&cid=B03002_001E&g=0400000US24|title=B03002 HISPANIC OR LATINO ORIGIN BY RACE\u2014Maryland\u20142018 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates|date=July 1, 2018 |publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 4, 2019}}</ref>\n| label1 = White Non-Hispanic\n| value1 = 50.23| color2=#36A\n| label2 = Black Non-Hispanic\n| value2 = 29.49 | color1=#6A5\n| label3 = Asian Non-Hispanic\n| value3 = 6.24 | color3=#1A9\n| label4 = Native American Non-Hispanic\n| value4 = 0.16 | color4=#928\n| label5 = Pacific Islander Non-Hispanic\n| value5 = 0.04| color5=#122\n| label6 = Two or more races Non-Hispanic\n| value6 = 3.02 | color6=#00FFFF\n| label7 = Other Non-Hispanic\n| value7 = 0.43 | color7=#E94196\n| label8 = Hispanic Any Race\n| value8 = 10.40 | color8=#9400D3\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|+ '''Maryland Racial Breakdown of Population'''\n|-\n!

Data is sourced from the [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/ 2014 ACS 5-year Estimate] report published by the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]].]]\n\nMaryland's economy benefits from the state's close proximity to the federal government in [[Washington, D.C.]] with an emphasis on technical and administrative tasks for the defense/aerospace industry and bio-research laboratories, as well as staffing of satellite government headquarters in the suburban or exurban Baltimore/Washington area. Ft. Meade serves as the headquarters of the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]], [[United States Cyber Command]], and the [[National Security Agency]]/[[Central Security Service]]. In addition, a number of educational and medical research institutions are located in the state. In fact, the various components of The [[Johns Hopkins University]] and its medical research facilities are now the largest single employer in the Baltimore area. Altogether, [[White-collar worker|white collar]] technical and administrative workers comprise 25 percent of Maryland's [[labor force]],{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} attributable in part to nearby Maryland being a part of the [[Washington Metro Area]] where the federal government office employment is relatively high.\n\nManufacturing, while large in dollar value, is highly diversified with no sub-sector contributing over 20 percent of the total. Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics, computer equipment, and chemicals. The once mighty primary metals sub-sector, which at one time included what was then the largest steel factory in the world at [[Sparrows Point]], still exists, but is pressed with foreign competition, [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcies]], and [[merger]]s. During World War II the Glenn Martin Company (now part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) airplane factory employed some 40,000 people.\n\nMining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal, which is located in the mountainous western part of the state. The brownstone quarries in the east, which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid-19th century, were once a predominant natural resource. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some near Washington, but these no longer exist.\n\n===Baltimore port===\n\nOne major service activity is transportation, centered on the [[Port of Baltimore]] and its related [[railroad|rail]] and trucking access. The port ranked 17th in the U.S. by tonnage in 2008.<ref>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center. New Orleans, LA.

The state as a whole is heavily industrialized, with a booming economy and influential technology centers. Its computer industries are some of the most sophisticated in the United States, and the federal government has invested heavily in the area. Maryland is home to several large military bases and scores of high level government jobs.\n\nThe [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] is a {{convert|14|mi|km}} [[canal]] on the Eastern Shore that connects the waters of the Delaware River with those of the Chesapeake Bay, and in particular with the Port of Baltimore, carrying 40 percent of the port's ship traffic.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |place=Philadelphia, PA |url=http://www.nap.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/ChesapeakeDelawareCanal.aspx |title=Chesapeake and Delaware Canal |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Agriculture and fishing===\n\nMaryland has a large food-production sector. A large component of this is commercial [[List of freshwater fishes of Maryland|fishing]], centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]], [[oysters]], [[striped bass]], and [[menhaden]]. The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges. The waterfowl support a [[birdwatching|tourism sector of sportsmen]].\n\n[[File:CarrollCountyMD.jpg|thumb|Agriculture is an important part of the state's economy.]]\nMaryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and [[Piedmont Plateau|Piedmont]] zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as [[cucumber]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[sweet corn]], [[tomato]]es, [[muskmelon]]s, [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], and [[peas]] (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). In addition, the southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a [[tobacco]] [[cash crop]] zone, which has existed since early Colonial times but declined greatly after a state government buyout in the 1990s. There is also a large automated [[chicken]]-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]] is home to [[Perdue Farms]]. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state.\n\n===Biotechnology===\n\nMaryland is a major center for [[life sciences]] research and development.

The intermediate appellate court is known as the [[Maryland Court of Special Appeals|Court of Special Appeals]] and the [[state supreme court]] is the [[Maryland Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]].

Its economy was heavily [[Plantation economy|plantation-based]], centered mostly on the cultivation of tobacco. The need for cheap labor led to a rapid expansion of indentured servants, penal labor, and African slaves. In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line|settlement]] of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the [[American Revolution]], and by 1776 its delegates signed the [[Declaration of Independence (U.S.)|Declaration of Independence]]. Many of its citizens subsequently played [[Maryland in the American Revolution|key political and military roles in the war]]. In 1790, the state ceded land for the establishment of the U.S. capital of [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nAlthough then a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]], Maryland [[Border states (American Civil War)|remained in the Union]] during the [[American Civil War]], its strategic location giving it [[Maryland in the American Civil War|a significant role in the conflict]]. After the war, Maryland took part in the [[Industrial Revolution]], driven by its seaports, railroad networks, and mass immigration from Europe. Since the Second World War, the state's population has grown rapidly, to approximately six million residents, and it is among the most densely populated U.S. states. {{as of|2015}}, Maryland had the [[List of U.S. states by income|highest median household income]] of any state, owing in large part to its close proximity to [[Washington, D.C.]] and a highly diversified economy spanning manufacturing, services, higher education, and biotechnology.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://proximityone.com/stmhi0910.htm\n|title=State Median Household Income Patterns: 1990\u20132010\n|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau\n|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref> The state's central role in U.S. history is reflected by its hosting of some of the [[List of U.S. National Historic Landmarks by state|highest numbers of historic landmarks]] per capita.\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{See also|List of islands of Maryland|List of rivers of Maryland}}\n[[File:MDGeoReg.PNG|thumb|left|upright=2.05|text-top|Physical regions of Maryland]]\n\nMaryland has an area of {{convert|12,406.68|sqmi|km2}} and is comparable in overall area with [[Belgium]] [{{convert|11787|mi2}}].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/be.html\n|title=Belgium\n|accessdate=May 15, 2008\n|date=May 15, 2008\n|website=CIA World Factbook\n|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency\n|quote=Area\u2014comparative: about the size of Maryland\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710084134/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/be.html\n|archivedate=July 10, 2016\n|df=mdy\n}}</ref> It is the 42nd largest and 9th smallest state and is closest in size to the state of [[Hawaii]] [{{convert|10930.98|mi2}}], the next smaller state.

It ranges from sandy [[dunes]] dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large [[Taxodium|bald cypress]] near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Region]], and [[pine]] groves in the [[List of mountains in Maryland|Maryland mountains]] to the west.\n\n[[File:Deep Creek Lake Maryland Panoramic View.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Western Maryland is known for its heavily forested mountains.

The mid-portion of this border is interrupted by [[District of Columbia]], which sits on land that was originally part of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] counties and including the town of [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown, Maryland]]. This land was ceded to the United States Federal Government in 1790 to form the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. (The [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] gave land south of the Potomac, including the town of [[Alexandria, Virginia]], however Virginia retroceded its portion in 1846). The [[Chesapeake Bay]] nearly bisects the state and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the ''[[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]]''.\n[[File:Patapsco fg01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Typical freshwater river above the tidal zone.

So prominent is the Chesapeake in Maryland's geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state's official nickname to the \"Bay State\", a nickname that has been used by [[Massachusetts]] for decades.\n\nThe highest point in Maryland, with an elevation of {{convert|3360|ft|m}}, is [[Backbone Mountain|Hoye Crest on Backbone Mountain]], in the southwest corner of [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]], near the border with West Virginia, and near the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River.

In 1902 the state regulated conditions in [[Mining|mines]]; outlawed [[child labor]]ers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first [[workers' compensation]] law. The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910.\n\nThe [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904 burned for more than 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks. More than 1,231 [[firefighter]]s worked to bring the blaze under control.\n[[File:Rubble_of_the_Great_Baltimore_Fire.jpg|thumb|Ruin left by the [[Great Baltimore Fire]]]]\nWith the nation's [[World War I#Entry of the United States|entry into World War I]] in 1917, new military bases such as [[Fort George G. Meade|Camp Meade]], the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and the [[Edgewood Arsenal]] were established. Existing facilities, including [[Fort McHenry]], were greatly expanded.\n\nAfter Georgia congressman [[William D. Upshaw]] criticized Maryland openly in 1923 for not passing [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] laws, ''Baltimore Sun'' editor Hamilton Owens coined the \"Free State\" nickname for Maryland in that context, which was popularized by [[H.

The biggest operations were [[Bethlehem Steel]]'s Fairfield Yard, which built [[Liberty ship]]s; and [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Glenn Martin]], an aircraft manufacturer.\n\n====1950\u2013present====\n\nMaryland experienced population growth following World War II. Beginning in the 1960s, as suburban growth took hold around Washington DC and Baltimore, the state began to take on a more mid-Atlantic culture as opposed to the traditionally Southern and Tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state. Agricultural tracts gave way to residential communities, some of them carefully planned such as [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]], [[St. Charles, Maryland|St. Charles]], and [[Montgomery Village, Maryland|Montgomery Village]]. Concurrently the [[Interstate Highway System]] was built throughout the state, most notably [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]], and the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]], altering travel patterns. In 1952 the eastern and western halves of Maryland were linked for the first time by the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]], which replaced a nearby [[ferry]] service.<ref name=\"baybridge.com-history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baybridge.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=|title=William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bay Bridge\u2014History|publisher=baybridge.com|accessdate=February 5, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701104741/http://www.baybridge.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=|archive-date=July 1, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMaryland's regions experienced economic changes following WWII. Heavy manufacturing declined in Baltimore. In Maryland's four westernmost counties, industrial, railroad, and coal mining jobs declined. On the lower [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], family farms were bought up by major concerns and large-scale poultry farms and vegetable farming became prevalent. In Southern Maryland, tobacco farming nearly vanished due to suburban development and a state tobacco buy-out program in the 1990s.\n\nIn an effort to reverse depopulation due to the loss of working-class industries, Baltimore initiated [[urban renewal]] projects in the 1960s with [[Charles Center]] and the [[Baltimore World Trade Center]]. Some resulted in the break-up of intact residential neighborhoods, producing social volatility, and some older residential areas around the harbor have had units renovated and have become popular with new populations.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{See also|List of counties in Maryland|List of incorporated places in Maryland|List of census-designated places in Maryland}}\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 319728\n|1800= 341548\n|1810= 380546\n|1820= 407350\n|1830= 447040\n|1840= 470019\n|1850= 583034\n|1860= 687049\n|1870= 780894\n|1880= 934943\n|1890= 1042390\n|1900= 1188044\n|1910= 1295346\n|1920= 1449661\n|1930= 1631526\n|1940= 1821244\n|1950= 2343001\n|1960= 3100689\n|1970= 3922399\n|1980= 4216975\n|1990= 4781468\n|2000= 5296486\n|2010= 5773552\n|estimate= 6045680\n|estyear= 2019\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=Source: 1910\u20132010<ref>{{cite web|author=Resident Population Data|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|title=Resident Population Data\u20142010 Census|publisher=2010.census.gov|accessdate=December 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118011236/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|archivedate=November 18, 2011|df=mdy}}</ref><br>2018 estimate<ref name=\"PopEstUS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/md,US/PST045218|title=QuickFacts Maryland; United States|format=|website=2018 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=February 7, 2019|accessdate=February 7, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Map of maryland counties.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[List of counties in Maryland|Maryland's counties]]]]\n\nThe [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Maryland was 6,042,718 on July 1, 2018, a 4.71% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]] and an increase of 2,962, from the prior year.

Data is sourced from the [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/ 2014 ACS 5-year Estimate] report published by the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]].]]\n\nMaryland's economy benefits from the state's close proximity to the federal government in [[Washington, D.C.]] with an emphasis on technical and administrative tasks for the defense/aerospace industry and bio-research laboratories, as well as staffing of satellite government headquarters in the suburban or exurban Baltimore/Washington area. Ft. Meade serves as the headquarters of the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]], [[United States Cyber Command]], and the [[National Security Agency]]/[[Central Security Service]]. In addition, a number of educational and medical research institutions are located in the state. In fact, the various components of The [[Johns Hopkins University]] and its medical research facilities are now the largest single employer in the Baltimore area. Altogether, [[White-collar worker|white collar]] technical and administrative workers comprise 25 percent of Maryland's [[labor force]],{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} attributable in part to nearby Maryland being a part of the [[Washington Metro Area]] where the federal government office employment is relatively high.\n\nManufacturing, while large in dollar value, is highly diversified with no sub-sector contributing over 20 percent of the total. Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics, computer equipment, and chemicals. The once mighty primary metals sub-sector, which at one time included what was then the largest steel factory in the world at [[Sparrows Point]], still exists, but is pressed with foreign competition, [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcies]], and [[merger]]s. During World War II the Glenn Martin Company (now part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) airplane factory employed some 40,000 people.\n\nMining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal, which is located in the mountainous western part of the state. The brownstone quarries in the east, which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid-19th century, were once a predominant natural resource. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some near Washington, but these no longer exist.\n\n===Baltimore port===\n\nOne major service activity is transportation, centered on the [[Port of Baltimore]] and its related [[railroad|rail]] and trucking access. The port ranked 17th in the U.S. by tonnage in 2008.<ref>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center. New Orleans, LA.

The state as a whole is heavily industrialized, with a booming economy and influential technology centers. Its computer industries are some of the most sophisticated in the United States, and the federal government has invested heavily in the area. Maryland is home to several large military bases and scores of high level government jobs.\n\nThe [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] is a {{convert|14|mi|km}} [[canal]] on the Eastern Shore that connects the waters of the Delaware River with those of the Chesapeake Bay, and in particular with the Port of Baltimore, carrying 40 percent of the port's ship traffic.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |place=Philadelphia, PA |url=http://www.nap.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/ChesapeakeDelawareCanal.aspx |title=Chesapeake and Delaware Canal |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Agriculture and fishing===\n\nMaryland has a large food-production sector. A large component of this is commercial [[List of freshwater fishes of Maryland|fishing]], centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]], [[oysters]], [[striped bass]], and [[menhaden]]. The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges. The waterfowl support a [[birdwatching|tourism sector of sportsmen]].\n\n[[File:CarrollCountyMD.jpg|thumb|Agriculture is an important part of the state's economy.]]\nMaryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and [[Piedmont Plateau|Piedmont]] zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as [[cucumber]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[sweet corn]], [[tomato]]es, [[muskmelon]]s, [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], and [[peas]] (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). In addition, the southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a [[tobacco]] [[cash crop]] zone, which has existed since early Colonial times but declined greatly after a state government buyout in the 1990s. There is also a large automated [[chicken]]-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]] is home to [[Perdue Farms]]. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state.\n\n===Biotechnology===\n\nMaryland is a major center for [[life sciences]] research and development.

Upon graduating from school in 1928, his effort to enroll at the [[Moscow State University|1st Moscow University]] went in vain as his father came from an aristocratic background. He later worked as a guide at the zoo and in 1933 he was successful in becoming a student of biology, studying the reproduction of the [[red squirrel]]. He was influenced by [[Aleksandr Formozov]]. In 1934 he was imprisoned and sent into exile in [[Karelia]]. The cause was apparently a politically critical poem written by a member of the Young Biologists' Club. The [[NKVD]] interrogated members and 13 persons were sent to a labour camp, accused of counter-revolutionary activities. He too was considered guilty for not recognizing the political crimes of others and for not denouncing them. In prison, he was involved in hunting squirrels for their pelt. He was released in 1937 but forbidden to take up permanent residence anywhere within 100 kilometres of Moscow. He then travelled through the steppe to [[Esenguly|Gasan-Kuli]] on the Caspian coast and found work in the [[Hazar State Nature Reserve|eponymous nature reserve]] in [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenistan]]. Here he studied water birds. In 1940 he married zoologist Olga Nikolayevna Sassonova. In 1941 the draft board referred him to a medical station in Siberia's [[Tomsk]] to fight [[tularemia]]. He contracted [[tuberculosis]] and became seriously ill during this period but recovered. He also continued studies through correspondence courses at Moscow State University and completed his examination in 1944. After [[World War II]] he became director of the Volga Delta Nature Reserve in [[Astrakhan]] and in 1947 he studied the effects of damming of the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Sheksna River|Sheksna]] with the creation of the [[Rybinsk Reservoir]].

The 'party lead' column shows the percentage-point difference between the two parties with the highest figures. In the instance of a tie, both figures are shaded and displayed in bold. Percentages may not add to 100 percent due to rounding.\nRefusals are generally excluded from the party vote percentages, while question wording and the treatment of \"don't know\" responses and those not intending to vote may vary between survey organisations.\n{| class=\"sortable\" \"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width:1100px; text-align:center; float:left; margin-right:.5em; margin-top:.4em; font-size:90%; border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n|-\n|- style=\"height:35px\n! style=\"width:15em;\" | Date<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"dates\">These are the survey dates of the poll, or if the survey dates are not stated, the date the poll was released.</ref>\n! style=\"width:20em;\" | Polling organisation\n! style=\"width:10em;\" | Sample size\n! style=\"background-color:#B0CEFF;width:60px\" | [[New Zealand National Party|NAT]]\n! style=\"background-color:#FFB6B6;width:60px\" | [[New Zealand Labour Party|LAB]]\n! style=\"background-color:#D3D3D3;width:60px\" | [[New Zealand First|NZF]]\n! style=\"background-color:#90EE90;width:60px\" | [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|GRN]]\n! style=\"background-color:#FFFF00;width:60px\" | [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]]\n! style=\"background-color:#899AD1;width:60px\" | [[The Opportunities Party|TOP]]\n! style=\"background-color:#AD6460;width:60px\" | [[M\u0101ori Party|MRI]]\n! style=\"background-color:#91D3FF;width:60px\" | [[New Conservative Party (New Zealand)|NCP]]\n! style=\"width:2em;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | Lead\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#EFEFEF;\"\n| data-sort-value=\"2020-03-19\"|'''23 March 2020''' || colspan=\"11\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | '''Due to consistently large day-to-day increases in confirmed cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in New Zealand, Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] announces that the entire country, aside from essential services, will go into complete lockdown for a period of at least four weeks.
