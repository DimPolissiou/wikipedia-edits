It was one of the [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll|deadliest human conflicts]] of ancient times. Fought across the entire Western [[Mediterranean]] region for 17 years and regarded by [[Livy]] as the greatest war in history, it was waged with unparalleled resources, skill, and hatred.<ref name=\"Livy\" />{{rp|21.1}} It saw hundreds of thousands killed, some of the [[List of battles by casualties|most lethal battles]] in military history, the destruction of cities, and massacres and enslavements of civilian populations and prisoners of war by both sides.\n\nThe war began with the Carthaginian general [[Hannibal]]'s [[Siege of Saguntum|conquest]] of the pro-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Iberian city of [[Sagunto Castle|Saguntum]] in 219 BC, prompting a Roman declaration of war on Carthage in the spring of 218. Hannibal surprised the Romans by marching his army overland from [[Iberia]] to [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|cross the Alps]] and invade [[Roman Italy]], followed by his reinforcement by [[Gauls|Gallic]] allies and crushing victories over Roman armies at the battles of [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]] in 218 and [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]] in 217. Moving to [[southern Italy]] in 216, at the [[Battle of Cannae]] Hannibal [[battle of annihilation|annihilated]] the largest army the Romans had ever assembled. After the death or imprisonment of 130,000 Roman troops in two years, 40% of Rome's [[Socii|Italian allies]] defected to Carthage, giving it control over most of southern Italy. As [[Kingdom of Syracuse|Syracuse]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] joined the Carthaginian side after Cannae, the conflict spread to [[Siege of Syracuse (213\u2013212 BC)|Sicily]] and triggered the [[First Macedonian War]] in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. From 215\u2013210 the [[Military of Carthage|Carthaginian army]] and navy launched repeated [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] assaults to capture Roman Sicily and Sardinia, but were ultimately repulsed.\n\nAgainst Hannibal's skill on the battlefield, the five-time [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Fabius Maximus]] organised a [[Fabian strategy|war of attrition]] against him, while fighting his allies and the other Carthaginian generals. Roman armies slowly recaptured most of the cities that had joined Carthage and defeated a Carthaginian attempt to reinforce Hannibal at [[Battle of the Metaurus|Metaurus]] in 207. Southern Italy was devastated by the combatants, with hundreds of thousands of civilians killed or enslaved. In Iberia, which served as a major source of silver and manpower for the Carthaginian army, Roman operations were led by members of the [[Family tree of the Cornelii Scipiones|Cornelii Scipiones]]. In 209, [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] [[Battle of Cartagena (209 BC)|captured Carthago Nova]], then won a streak of great victories, notably at [[Battle of Ilipa|Ilipa]] in 206, which permanently ended [[Carthaginian Iberia|Carthaginian rule]] in Iberia. He invaded Carthaginian Africa in 204, inflicting two severe defeats on Carthage and her allies at [[Battle of Utica (203 BC)|Utica]] and the [[Battle of the Great Plains|Great Plains]] that compelled the Carthaginian [[senate]] to recall Hannibal's army from Italy. The final engagement between Scipio and Hannibal took place at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]] in Africa in 202 and resulted in Hannibal's defeat and the imposition of [[Carthaginian peace|harsh peace conditions]] on the Punic city. As a result, Carthage ceased to be a great power and became a Roman [[client state]] until its [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|final destruction]] by [[Scipio Aemilianus]] in 146 BC during the [[Third Punic War]]. The Second Punic War overthrew the established [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] of the [[ancient world]] and Rome rose to become the dominant power in the [[Mediterranean Basin]] for the next 600 years.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Dishekel hispano-cartagin\u00e9s-2.jpg|thumb|A [[Carthaginian currency|Carthaginian]] [[shekel]], dated 237\u2013227 BC, depicting the Punic god [[Melqart]] (equivalent of [[Hercules]]/[[Heracles]]), most likely with the features of [[Hamilcar Barca]], father of [[Hannibal Barca]]; on the reverse is a man riding a [[war elephant]]]]\n{{For|an analysis of the strength and organisation of Roman forces on the eve of the war|Socii#Military organisation of the Roman alliance}}\nCarthage's defeat in the [[First Punic War]] meant the loss of Carthaginian Sicily to Rome under the terms of the Roman-dictated 241 BC [[Treaty of Lutatius]].{{sfn|Beck|2011|p=235}} Rome exploited Carthage's distraction during the [[Truceless War]] against rebellious mercenaries and Libyan subjects to break the peace treaty and [[annexation|annex]] Carthaginian [[Sardinia and Corsica]] to Rome in 238 BC.{{sfn|Beck|2011|p=235}} Under the leadership of [[Hamilcar Barca]] and his family, Carthage defeated the rebels and began the [[Barcid conquest of Hispania]] from 237 BC onward.{{sfn|Beck|2011|p=235}}{{sfn|Barcel\u00f3|2011|p=360}} Control over Spain gave Carthage the silver mines, agricultural wealth, [[manpower]], military facilities such as [[shipyard]]s and territorial depth to stand up to future Roman demands with confidence.{{sfn|Barcel\u00f3|2011|p=362}}\n\nThe Second Punic War was ignited by the dispute over the [[hegemony]] of [[Saguntum]], a [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Iberian coastal city with diplomatic contacts with Rome.{{sfn|Beck|2011|p=230}}<ref name=mahaney2008>Mahaney, W.C., 2008, Hannibal's Odyssey: Environmental Background to the Alpine Invasion of Italia.

Most Roman troops during the war fought in Italy, which became the main theater of the war as a result of Hannibal's offensive.{{sfn|Barcel\u00f3|2011|p=364}} Africa remained undisturbed by a Roman invasion army until 204 BC and the Roman military presence in Spain was confined to its northeastern corner until 209 BC. The continuation of Carthaginian rule in Africa and Spain enabled her to mobilize more armies and fleets, attempt the reconquest of Sicily and Sardinia from 215 to 210 BC and further invade Italy with [[Hasdrubal Barca]]'s army in 208 BC and with [[Mago Barca]]'s forces from 205 to 203 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2010|p=206}}\n\nTo win the war, Hannibal in Italy sought to build up a united front of the northern Italian [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribes and south Italian [[city state]]s to encircle Rome and confine it to central Italy, where it would pose a lesser threat to Carthage's power-political freedom of action.{{sfn|Barcel\u00f3|2011|pp=365\u2013367}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=129}} A Carthaginian [[protectorate]] over Italy would be created, enforced by the presence of Carthaginian soldier colonists and the Carthaginian annexation of parts of Italy.{{sfn|Barcel\u00f3|2011|pp=365\u2013367}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=129}} This would act as a check on Roman revanchism.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=129}} Sicily and Sardinia were also to be regained for Carthage by sending expeditionary forces and allying with anti-Roman rebels on both islands.{{sfn|Barcel\u00f3|2011|p=371}}\n\n==Course of the war==\n===Beginning of the war (218\u2013217 BC)===\n[[File:Hannibal route of invasion-en.svg|right|300px|thumb|Route of Hannibal's invasion of Italy]]\n[[File:Hannibal traversant les Alpes \u00e0 dos d'\u00e9l\u00e9phant - Nicolas Poussin.jpg|thumb|right|Hannibal won fame for trekking across the Alps with 37 war elephants.

Hannibal then entered [[Gaul]] and took his army by an inland route, avoiding the Roman allies along the coast.<ref name=mahaney2008 /> At the [[Battle of Rhone Crossing]], Hannibal defeated a force of the [[Allobroges]] that sought to bar his way.{{sfn|Lazenby|1978|p=41}} A Roman fleet under the command of the brothers [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus]] and [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] with an invasion force intended for northern Spain landed at Rome's ally [[Marseille|Massalia]] by the [[Rhone]] river.{{sfn|Fronda|2011|p=252}} Hannibal evaded the Romans and by an unknown route reached the [[Is\u00e8re (river)|Is\u00e8re]] or the [[Durance]] at the foot of the Alps in autumn.<ref name=mahaney2008 /> Gnaeus Scipio continued to Iberia with the Roman army.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=291}}{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=321}} The other commander, Publius Scipio, returned to Rome, realizing the danger of an invasion of Italy where the tribes of the [[Boii]] and [[Insubres]] were already in revolt.{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=321}} After 217 BC, he moved to Iberia.{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=321}}\n\n====Spain (218\u2013217 BC)====\nGnaeus Scipio landed his army at [[Tarraco|Cissa]] and won increasing support among the natives.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=291}} The Carthaginian commander in the area, [[Hanno, son of Bomilcar|Hanno]], refused to wait for Carthaginian reinforcements under [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]], attacked Scipio at the [[Battle of Cissa]] in late 218 BC and was defeated.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=291}}{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=321}} The combined Roman and [[Marseille|Massalian]] fleet and army posed a threat to the Carthaginians. In 217 BC, Hasdrubal moved up to engage them at the [[Battle of Ebro River]]. The 40 Carthaginian and Iberian vessels were severely defeated by the 55 Roman and Massalian ships in the second naval engagement of the war, with 29 Carthaginian ships lost. In the aftermath, the Carthaginian forces retreated, but the Romans remained confined to the area between the Ebro and Pyrenees.{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=321}}\n\n====Italy (218\u2013217 BC)====\nIn 218 BC, the Carthaginian navy was scouting [[Sicily|Sicilian]] waters and preparing for a surprise attack on their former key stronghold of [[Lilybaeum]] on the western tip of the island. Twenty [[quinquereme]]s, loaded with 1,000 soldiers, raided the [[Aegadian Islands]] west of Sicily and eight ships intended to attack the [[Aeolian Islands]], but were blown off-course in a storm towards the Straits of Messina. The Syracusan navy, then at Messina, captured three of those without resistance. Learning from their crews that a Carthaginian fleet was to attack Lilybaeum, [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]] warned the Roman [[praetor]] Marcus Amellius there. As a result, the Romans prepared 20 [[quinquereme]]s, which intercepted and defeated the 35 Carthaginian quinqueremes in the [[Battle of Lilybaeum]]. Subsequently, consul [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BC)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]] sailed with a fleet from Lilybaeum and [[Capture of Malta (218 BC)|captured the island of Malta]] from the Carthaginians without much of a fight.\n\nIn [[Cisalpine Gaul]], the Gallic Boii and Insubres rebels attacked the Roman colonies of [[Placentia, Italy|Placentia]] and [[Cremona]], causing the Romans to flee to [[Mutina]] (modern Modena), which the Gauls then besieged. A Roman relief army under [[Praetor]] [[L. Manlius Vulso]] raised the siege but was ambushed and besieged itself.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=151}} The [[Roman Senate]] sent one of Scipio's legions and 5,000 allied troops to aid Vulso. Scipio had to raise fresh troops to replace these and thus could not set out for Iberia until September 218 BC, giving Hannibal time to march from the Ebro to the Rhone.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=283}}\n\nHannibal crossed the Alps, surmounting the difficulties of climate and terrain,<ref name=mahaney2008 /> and the [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] of the native tribes. His exact route is disputed. Hannibal arrived with either 20,000 or 28,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry, and 37 elephants in the territory of the [[Taurini]], in what is now [[Piedmont]], northern Italy.<ref name=Del>Delbr\u00fcck, p. 362</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jr|first=Hans Delbr\u00fcck; translated from the German by Walter J.

Hannibal's army then routed the cavalry and light infantry of the Romans under Publius Scipio at the [[Battle of Ticinus]].{{sfn|Fronda|2011|p=243}} As a result of Rome's defeat at the Ticinus, all the Gauls except the [[Cenomani]] were induced to join the Carthaginian cause, bolstering Hannibal's army to at least 40,000 men.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=284}} Even before news of the defeat at the river [[Ticino (river)|Ticinus]] had reached Rome, the Senate had ordered the consul Sempronius Longus to bring his army back from Sicily, where it had been preparing for the invasion of Africa, to join Scipio and face Hannibal.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=284}} The united Roman force under the command of Sempronius Longus was lured into combat by Hannibal at the [[Battle of the Trebia]]. Hannibal's army encircled and destroyed the unprepared Romans.{{sfn|Fronda|2011|pp=243\u2013244}} Only 10,000 Romans out of 42,000 were able to retreat to safety. Having secured his position in northern Italy by this victory, Hannibal quartered his troops for the winter among the Gauls. The latter joined his army in large numbers, bringing it up to 60,000 men.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=284}}\n\nThe Roman Senate resolved to raise new armies against Hannibal under the recently elected consuls of 217 BC, [[Gnaeus Servilius Geminus]] and [[Gaius Flaminius]].<ref name=\"Livy\" />{{rp|21.63}} To block Hannibal's advance into central Italy, Flaminius moved his army from [[Ariminum]] to [[Arretium]], to cover the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine]] mountain passes into [[Etruria]]. His colleague Servilius deployed his freshly raised army at Ariminum to cover the route along the [[Adriatic]] coast. A third force, containing the survivors of previous engagements, was also stationed in Etruria under Scipio.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=285}}\n\n[[File:Battle of lake trasimene.gif|300px|right|thumb|[[Battle of Lake Trasimene]] plan\n{{legend|#000088|Carthaginians}}\n{{legend|#ee0000|Romans}}]]\nIn early spring 217 BC, Hannibal decided to advance, leaving his wavering Gallic allies in the Po Valley, and crossed the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] unopposed. He avoided the Roman positions and took the only unguarded route into [[Etruria]] at the mouth of the [[Arno]]. This route was through a huge marsh, which happened to be more flooded than usual for spring. Hannibal's army marched for several days without finding convenient places to rest, suffering terribly from fatigue and lack of sleep. This led to the loss of part of the force, including, it seems, the few remaining elephants.\n\nArriving in Etruria, still in the spring of 217 BC, Hannibal tried without success to draw the main Roman army under Flaminius into a [[pitched battle]] by devastating the area the latter had been sent to protect.<ref name=\"hart\">[[B. H. Liddell Hart|Liddell Hart, B. H.]], ''Strategy'', New York City, Penguin Group, 1967</ref> Hannibal then employed a new [[:wikt:stratagem|stratagem]], when he marched around his opponent's left flank and effectively cut him off from Rome. Advancing through the uplands of Etruria, the Carthaginian now provoked Flaminius into a hasty pursuit without proper reconnaissance.{{sfn|Fronda|2011|p=244}} Then, in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] on the shore of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimenus]], Hannibal lay in ambush with his army.{{sfn|Fronda|2011|p=244}} The ambush was a complete success: in the [[battle of Lake Trasimene]] Hannibal destroyed most of the Roman army and killed Flaminius with little loss to his own army.{{sfn|Fronda|2011|p=244}} 6,000 Romans had been able to escape, but were caught and forced to surrender by [[Maharbal]]'s Numidians. Furthermore, Geminus, aware of the fighting, sent his 4,000 cavalry in support, but it was also caught in [[Umbria]] and annihilated. Like after all previous engagements, the captured enemies were sorted according to whether they were Romans, who were held captive, or non-Romans, who were released to spread the propaganda that the Carthaginian army was in Italy to fight for their freedom against the Romans. Strategically, Hannibal had now disposed of the only field force that could check his advance on Rome but he did not attack the city. Instead, he marched to the south in the hope of winning over allies amongst the [[Magna Graecia|Greek]] and [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] population there.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=285}}\n\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n2.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of frieze showing the equipment of a soldier in the [[maniple (military unit)|manipular]] Roman legion (left).

The Senate decided to appoint [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Quintus Fabius Maximus]] as ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]''. The Senate also appointed his ''[[magister equitum]]'' (\"master of cavalry\", who acted as his second-in-command): [[Marcus Minucius Rufus (consul 221 BC)|Marcus Minucius Rufus]].<ref name=\"Livy\" />{{rp|22.8}}\n\nFabius invented the [[Fabian strategy]] of avoiding open battle with his opponent, but constantly skirmishing with small detachments of the enemy. This course was not popular among the soldiers, earning Fabius the nickname ''Cunctator'' (\"delayer\"), since he seemed to avoid battle while Italy was being burned by the enemy.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=285}} Having ravaged [[Apulia]] without provoking Fabius into a battle, Hannibal decided to march through [[Samnium]] to [[Campania]], one of the richest and most fertile provinces of Italy, hoping that the devastation would draw Fabius into battle. As the year wore on, Hannibal decided that it would be unwise to winter in the already devastated plains of Campania but Fabius had ensured that all the mountain passes offering an exit were blocked. This situation led to the [[Battle of Ager Falernus|night battle of Ager Falernus]] in which the Carthaginians made good their escape by tricking the Romans into believing that they were heading to the heights above them.{{sfn|Fronda|2011|p=245}} This was a severe blow to Fabius\u2019 prestige.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=285}}\n\n[[File:Sg0542.jpg|thumb|right|Roman coin issued during the Second Punic war showing (obverse) the god of war [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and (reverse) image of a Roman cavalryman of the time.

As soon as he scored a minor success, by winning a skirmish with the Carthaginians near Geronium, the Senate promoted Minucius to the same ''[[imperium]]'' (power of command) as Fabius, whom he accused of cowardice. In consequence, the two men decided to split the army between them. Minucius' troops were swiftly lured into an ambush and decimated by Hannibal at the [[Battle of Geronium]]. Fabius rushed to his co-commander's assistance and Hannibal's forces immediately retreated. Subsequently, Minucius accepted Fabius' authority and ended their political conflict.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=285}}\n\n===Carthaginian ascendancy (216\u2013215 BC)===\n====Italy (216\u2013215 BC)====\nFabius became unpopular in Rome, since his tactics did not lead to a quick end to the war. The Roman populace derided the ''Cunctator'', and at the elections of 216 BC elected as consuls [[Gaius Terentius Varro]] who advocated pursuing a more aggressive war strategy and [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], who advocated a strategy in the middle between the Fabian tactics and the tactics suggested by Varro.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=286}}\n\nIn the campaign of 217 BC, Hannibal had failed to obtain a following among the [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italics]]. In the spring of 216 BC, he took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at [[Cannae]] in the Apulian plain. The Roman Senate authorized the raising of double-sized armies by the consuls Varro and Aemilius Paullus, a force of 86,000 men, the largest in Roman history up to that point.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=286}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Cannae, 215 BC - Initial Roman attack.gif|right|thumb|400px|Opening and decisive phase of the [[Battle of Cannae]], 216 BC.

The greatest gain was the second largest city of Italy, [[Capua]], when Hannibal's army marched into [[Campania]] in 216 BC. The inhabitants of Capua held limited Roman citizenship and the aristocracy was linked to the Romans via marriage and friendship, but the possibility of becoming the supreme city of Italy after the evident Roman disasters proved too strong a temptation. The treaty between them and Hannibal can be described as an agreement of friendship, since the Capuans had no obligations, but provided the harbour through which Hannibal was reinforced.<ref>Hoyos 122f</ref>\n\nIn 216 BC, another disaster struck Rome as the consul-elect for 215, [[Lucius Postumius Albinus (consul 234 BC)|Lucius Postumius Albinus]] was ambushed along with his 25,000 soldiers by Boii Gauls northwest of Ariminum at the [[Battle of Silva Litana]].

His subordinate Hanno was able to raise troops in [[Samnium]], but the Romans intercepted these new levies in the [[Battle of Beneventum (214 BC)]] and eliminated them before they came under the leadership of Hannibal. Hannibal could win allies, but defending them against the Romans was a new and difficult problem, as the Romans could still field multiple armies greatly outnumbering his own forces.

The [[Battle of Tarentum (212 BC)]] was a carefully planned coup by Hannibal and members of the city's democratic faction. There were two separate successful assaults on the gates of the city. This enabled the Carthaginian army, which had approached unobserved behind a screen of marauding Numidian horsemen, to enter the city by surprise and take all but the citadel where the Romans and their supporting faction were able to rally. The Carthaginians failed to take the citadel, but subsequent fortifications around this Roman stronghold put the city under Carthaginian control. However, the harbour was blocked and warships had to be transported overland to be launched at sea.\n\nThe [[Battle of Capua (212 BC)]] was a stalemate. The Romans decided to end the siege of Capua.

So he tried a strategem of staging a march towards Rome, hoping in this way to compel the enemy to abandon the siege and rush to defend their home city.

This didn't happen, however, so they participated with the [[Mutiny at Sucro|mutineers at the Sucro camp]] against the Romans. This mutiny was ultimately squelched by Scipio Africanus.<ref name=\"Livy2\">[[Livy]]. ''The History of Rome by Titus Livius: Books Twenty-Seven to Thirty-Six,'' trans. Cyrus Edmonds. London: 1850.</ref>{{rp|28.24}} In 205 BC, a last attempt was made by Mago to recapture [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]] when the Roman occupiers were shaken by a mutiny and an Iberian uprising against their new overlords; the attack was repulsed. So, in the same year, Mago left Spain, setting sail from the [[Balearic islands]] to Italy with his remaining forces.{{sfn|Barcel\u00f3|2011|p=362}} Carthage in 203 BC succeeded in recruiting at least 4,000 mercenaries from Iberia despite Rome's nominal control.{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=333}}\n\nIn 206 BC, there was a quick succession of kings in Eastern [[Numidia]] that temporarily ended with the division of the land between Carthage and the Western Numidian king [[Syphax]], a former Roman ally. For this bargain, Syphax was to marry [[Sophonisba]], daughter of [[Hasdrubal Gisco]]. [[Massinissa]], who had thus lost his [[fiancee]], went over to the Romans with whom he had already established contact during his military service in Spain.{{sfn|Barcel\u00f3|2011|p=372}}\n\n===Roman invasion of Africa (204\u2013203 BC)===\n[[File:Campagna africana di Scipione 204-203 aC.png|thumb|left|300px|[[Publius Cornelius Scipio]]'s military campaign in Africa (204\u2013203 B.C.)]]\nAt the same time, [[Scipio Africanus Major]] was given command of the legions in [[Sicily]] and was allowed to levy volunteers for his plan to end the war by an invasion of Africa. The legions in Sicily were mainly the survivors of Cannae, who were not allowed home until the war was finished. Scipio was also one of the survivors but, unlike the ordinary soldiers, had been allowed to return to Rome along with the other surviving [[Military tribune|tribunes]], and had run successfully for public office and had been given command of the troops in Iberia.\n\nAfter landing in Africa, Scipio besieged and failed to take the city of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] in the [[Siege of Utica (204 BC)]]. When a Carthaginian and Numidian relief army under [[Hasdrubal Barca]] and [[Syphax]] moved to confront Scipio, the Romans mounted a surprise attack on their enemies at the [[Battle of Utica (203 BC)]] and defeated them with complete success. Scipio broke out into the Carthaginian hinterland and a second Carthaginian-Numidian army was attacked and destroyed at the [[Battle of the Great Plains]] in 203 BC. King Syphax of the [[Masaesyli|Massaesylians]] (western Numidians), was defeated and taken prisoner after the [[Battle of Cirta]]. [[Masinissa]], a Numidian rival of Syphax and, at that time, an ally of the Romans, seized a large part of his kingdom with their help. These setbacks persuaded some in the Carthaginian Senate that it was time to sue for peace. Others pleaded for the recall of Hannibal and Mago, who were still fighting the Romans in Bruttium and [[Cisalpine Gaul]], respectively.\n\n====Italy (204\u2013203 BC)====\nIn 205, Mago landed in [[Genoa|Genua]] by sea the remnants of his Spanish army. This was the third Carthaginian force invading Italy. It soon received Gallic and Ligurian reinforcements. Mago's arrival in the north of the Italian peninsula was followed by Hannibal's [[Battle of Crotona]] in 204 in the south of the peninsula. Mago marched his reinforced army towards the lands of the Boii and Insubres, Carthage's main Gallic allies and a place of retreat for Hasdrubal's defeated remnants. His move was checked by four Roman legions and allies under Publius Varus and [[Marcus Cornelius Cethegus]] at the [[Battle of Insubria]] in 203. This hindered the third attempted invasion of Italy early, by preventing Mago from uniting with Hannibal's army in the south.\n\n===End of the war (202\u2013201 BC)===\nIn 203 BC, while [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] was carrying all before him in Africa and the Carthaginian peace party were arranging an [[armistice]], Hannibal was recalled from Italy by the war party at Carthage. After leaving a record of his expedition engraved in [[Punic language|Punic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] upon bronze tablets in the temple of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] at [[Crotone]], he sailed back to Africa. These records were later quoted by [[Polybius]]. Hannibal's arrival immediately restored the predominance of the war party, who placed him in command of a combined force of Mediterranean mercenaries, African [[Conscription#Medieval levies|levies]] and his veterans from Italy. In 202 BC, Hannibal met Scipio in a peace conference. Despite the two generals' mutual admiration, negotiations floundered, according to the Romans due to \"Punic faith\", meaning bad faith. This Roman expression referred to the alleged breach of protocols which ended the [[First Punic War]] by the Carthaginian attack on Saguntum, Hannibal's perceived breaches of what the Romans perceived as military etiquette (i.e., Hannibal's numerous ambuscades), as well as the armistice violated by the Carthaginians in the period before Hannibal's return.\n\n[[File:Schlacht bei Zama Gem\u00e4lde H P Motte.jpg|thumb|Carthaginian war elephants engage Roman infantry at the Battle of Zama (202 BC).]]\n\nThe decisive [[Battle of Zama]] soon followed. Unlike most battles of the Second Punic War, the Romans had superiority in cavalry and the Carthaginians had superiority in infantry.\nScipio countered an expected Carthaginian elephant charge, which caused some of Hannibal's elephants to turn back into his own ranks, throwing his cavalry into disarray. The Roman cavalry was able to capitalize on this and drive the Carthaginian cavalry from the field. The battle remained closely fought and, at one point, it seemed that Hannibal was on the verge of victory. Scipio's cavalry then returned from chasing the Carthaginian cavalry and attacked Hannibal's rear. This two-pronged attack caused the Carthaginian formation to disintegrate and collapse. After their defeat, Hannibal convinced the Carthaginians to accept peace.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=295}} Notably, he broke the rules of the assembly by forcibly removing a speaker who supported continued resistance. Afterwards, he was obliged to apologize for his behaviour.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Carthage-1958-PortsPuniques.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Aerial view (1958) of Carthage's [[cothon]]-type military harbour.\nThe circular naval base was situated on the central peninsula. The entrance to the harbour has silted up.]]\n[[File:Maquette Port militaire punique 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Scale model of the circular naval base at Carthage. Note the individual docking bays for warships.]]\n\nCarthage lost Hispania forever, and Rome firmly established her power there over large areas. Rome imposed a war indemnity<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/punic-wars | title=Punic Wars}}</ref> of 10,000 silver [[talent (weight)|talents]] (300 [[tonne]]s/660,000 pounds), limited the Carthaginian navy to 10 ships (to ward off pirates), and forbade Carthage from raising an army without Roman permission. The Numidians took the opportunity to capture and plunder Carthaginian territory. Half a century later, when Carthage raised an army to defend itself from these incursions, Rome destroyed her in the [[Third Punic War]] (149\u2013146 BC). Rome, on the other hand, by her victory, had taken a key step towards what ultimately became her domination of the [[Mediterranean]] world.\n\nThe end of the war did not meet with a universal welcome in Rome. When the Senate decided upon a peace treaty with Carthage, [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus (died 175 BC)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], a former consul, said he did not look upon the termination of the war as a blessing to Rome, since he feared that the Roman people would now sink back again into its former slumbers, from which it had been roused by the presence of Hannibal.<ref>[[Valerius Maximus]] vii. 2. \u00a73.\n</ref> Others, most notably [[Cato the Elder]], feared that if Carthage was not completely destroyed it would soon regain its power and pose new threats to Rome; he pressed for harsher peace conditions. Even after the peace, Cato insisted on the destruction of Carthage, ending all his speeches with [[Carthago delenda est|\"Carthage must be destroyed\"]], even if they had nothing to do with Carthage.<ref>[[Plutarch]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html Life of Cato]</ref>\n\nArchaeology has discovered that the famous circular military harbour at Carthage, the [[Cothon]], received a significant buildup during or after this war. Though shielded from external sight, it could house and quickly deploy about 200 [[triremes]]. This appears a surprising development as, after the war, one of the terms of surrender restricted the Carthaginian fleet to only ten triremes. One possible explanation: as has been pointed out for other Phoenician cities, [[privateer]]s with warships played a significant role besides trade, even when the Roman Empire was fully established and officially controlled all coasts. In this case it is not clear whether the treaty included private warships. The only reference to Carthaginian privateers comes from the First Punic War: one such privateer, Hanno the Rhodian, owned a [[quinquereme]] (faster than the serial production models that the Romans had copied), manned with about 500 men and then among the heaviest warships in use. Later pirates in Roman waters are all reported with much smaller vessels, which could outrun naval vessels, but operated with lower personnel costs. Thus piracy was probably highly developed in Carthage and the state did not have a monopoly of military forces. Pirates probably played an important role in capturing slaves, one of the most profitable trade-goods, but merchant ships with tradeable goods and a crew were also their targets. No surviving source reports the fate of Carthaginian privateers in the periods between and after the Punic Wars.\n\nHannibal became a businessman for several years and later enjoyed a leadership role in Carthage. However, the Carthaginian nobility, upset by his policy of democratisation and his struggle against corruption, persuaded the Romans to force him into exile in [[Asia Minor]], where he again led armies against the Romans and their allies on the battlefield. He eventually committed suicide (c. 182 BC) to avoid capture.\n\nConstant low-level warfare persisted between Carthage and Numidia, but, by the time of the [[Third Punic War]] (149\u2013146 BC), Carthage had lost most of its African territories and the Numidians traded independently with the Greeks.\n\n==Intelligence==\nIn this conflict, intelligence played an important role on both sides. Hannibal mastered an intelligence service that enabled him to achieve outstanding victories.<ref>Zlattner 1997</ref> Likewise, Scipio Africanus Major's victories depended on information. In 217 BC, a Carthaginian resident spy in Rome\u2014probably a Roman citizen\u2014was caught and had his hands cut off as a punishment.<ref name=\"Livy\" />{{rp|22.33.1}}<ref>Austin&Rankov 1995, p. 93</ref>\n\n==Opinions on the war==\n[[Livy]] portrayed the Punic War as <blockquote>\"the most memorable of all wars that were ever waged: the war which the Carthaginians, under the conduct of Hannibal, maintained with the Roman people. For never did any states and nations more efficient in their resources engage in contest; nor had they themselves at any other period so great a degree of power and energy. They brought into action too no arts of war unknown to each other, but those which had been tried in the [[first Punic war]]; and so various was the fortune of the conflict, and so doubtful the victory, that they who conquered were more exposed to danger. The hatred with which they fought also was almost greater than their resources.\"<ref name=\"Livy\" />\n{{rp|21.1}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* [[G. A.

It was one of the [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll|deadliest human conflicts]] of ancient times. Fought across the entire Western [[Mediterranean]] region for 17 years and regarded by [[Livy]] as the greatest war in history, it was waged with unparalleled resources, skill, and hatred.<ref name=\"Livy\" />{{rp|21.1}} It saw hundreds of thousands killed, some of the [[List of battles by casualties|most lethal battles]] in military history, the destruction of cities, and massacres and enslavements of civilian populations and prisoners of war by both sides.\n\nThe war began with the Carthaginian general [[Hannibal]]'s [[Siege of Saguntum|conquest]] of the pro-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Iberian city of [[Sagunto Castle|Saguntum]] in 219 BC, prompting a Roman declaration of war on Carthage in the spring of 218. Hannibal surprised the Romans by marching his army overland from [[Iberia]] to [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|cross the Alps]] and invade [[Roman Italy]], followed by his reinforcement by [[Gauls|Gallic]] allies and crushing victories over Roman armies at the battles of [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]] in 218 and [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]] in 217. Moving to [[southern Italy]] in 216, at the [[Battle of Cannae]] Hannibal [[battle of annihilation|annihilated]] the largest army the Romans had ever assembled. After the death or imprisonment of 130,000 Roman troops in two years, 40% of Rome's [[Socii|Italian allies]] defected to Carthage, giving it control over most of southern Italy. As [[Kingdom of Syracuse|Syracuse]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] joined the Carthaginian side after Cannae, the conflict spread to [[Siege of Syracuse (213\u2013212 BC)|Sicily]] and triggered the [[First Macedonian War]] in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. From 215\u2013210 the [[Military of Carthage|Carthaginian army]] and navy launched repeated [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] assaults to capture Roman Sicily and Sardinia, but were ultimately repulsed.\n\nAgainst Hannibal's skill on the battlefield, the five-time [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Fabius Maximus]] organised a [[Fabian strategy|war of attrition]] against him, while fighting his allies and the other Carthaginian generals. Roman armies slowly recaptured most of the cities that had joined Carthage and defeated a Carthaginian attempt to reinforce Hannibal at [[Battle of the Metaurus|Metaurus]] in 207. Southern Italy was devastated by the combatants, with hundreds of thousands of civilians killed or enslaved. In Iberia, which served as a major source of silver and manpower for the Carthaginian army, Roman operations were led by members of the [[Family tree of the Cornelii Scipiones|Cornelii Scipiones]]. In 209, [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] [[Battle of Cartagena (209 BC)|captured Carthago Nova]], then won a streak of great victories, notably at [[Battle of Ilipa|Ilipa]] in 206, which permanently ended [[Carthaginian Iberia|Carthaginian rule]] in Iberia. He invaded Carthaginian Africa in 204, inflicting two severe defeats on Carthage and her allies at [[Battle of Utica (203 BC)|Utica]] and the [[Battle of the Great Plains|Great Plains]] that compelled the Carthaginian [[senate]] to recall Hannibal's army from Italy. The final engagement between Scipio and Hannibal took place at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]] in Africa in 202 and resulted in Hannibal's defeat and the imposition of [[Carthaginian peace|harsh peace conditions]] on the Punic city. As a result, Carthage ceased to be a great power and became a Roman [[client state]] until its [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|final destruction]] by [[Scipio Aemilianus]] in 146 BC during the [[Third Punic War]].

The 40 Carthaginian and Iberian vessels were severely defeated by the 55 Roman and Massalian ships in the second naval engagement of the war, with 29 Carthaginian ships lost.

Twenty [[quinquereme]]s, loaded with 1,000 soldiers, raided the [[Aegadian Islands]] west of Sicily and eight ships intended to attack the [[Aeolian Islands]], but were blown off-course in a storm towards the Straits of Messina. The Syracusan navy, then at Messina, captured three of those without resistance. Learning from their crews that a Carthaginian fleet was to attack Lilybaeum, [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]] warned the Roman [[praetor]] Marcus Amellius there. As a result, the Romans prepared 20 [[quinquereme]]s, which intercepted and defeated the 35 Carthaginian quinqueremes in the [[Battle of Lilybaeum]]. Subsequently, consul [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BC)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]] sailed with a fleet from Lilybaeum and [[Capture of Malta (218 BC)|captured the island of Malta]] from the Carthaginians without much of a fight.\n\nIn [[Cisalpine Gaul]], the Gallic Boii and Insubres rebels attacked the Roman colonies of [[Placentia, Italy|Placentia]] and [[Cremona]], causing the Romans to flee to [[Mutina]] (modern Modena), which the Gauls then besieged. A Roman relief army under [[Praetor]] [[L.

Hannibal's army encircled and destroyed the unprepared Romans.{{sfn|Fronda|2011|pp=243\u2013244}} Only 10,000 Romans out of 42,000 were able to retreat to safety. Having secured his position in northern Italy by this victory, Hannibal quartered his troops for the winter among the Gauls. The latter joined his army in large numbers, bringing it up to 60,000 men.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=284}}\n\nThe Roman Senate resolved to raise new armies against Hannibal under the recently elected consuls of 217 BC, [[Gnaeus Servilius Geminus]] and [[Gaius Flaminius]].<ref name=\"Livy\" />{{rp|21.63}} To block Hannibal's advance into central Italy, Flaminius moved his army from [[Ariminum]] to [[Arretium]], to cover the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine]] mountain passes into [[Etruria]]. His colleague Servilius deployed his freshly raised army at Ariminum to cover the route along the [[Adriatic]] coast. A third force, containing the survivors of previous engagements, was also stationed in Etruria under Scipio.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=285}}\n\n[[File:Battle of lake trasimene.gif|300px|right|thumb|[[Battle of Lake Trasimene]] plan\n{{legend|#000088|Carthaginians}}\n{{legend|#ee0000|Romans}}]]\nIn early spring 217 BC, Hannibal decided to advance, leaving his wavering Gallic allies in the Po Valley, and crossed the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] unopposed. He avoided the Roman positions and took the only unguarded route into [[Etruria]] at the mouth of the [[Arno]]. This route was through a huge marsh, which happened to be more flooded than usual for spring. Hannibal's army marched for several days without finding convenient places to rest, suffering terribly from fatigue and lack of sleep. This led to the loss of part of the force, including, it seems, the few remaining elephants.\n\nArriving in Etruria, still in the spring of 217 BC, Hannibal tried without success to draw the main Roman army under Flaminius into a [[pitched battle]] by devastating the area the latter had been sent to protect.<ref name=\"hart\">[[B.

Furthermore, Geminus, aware of the fighting, sent his 4,000 cavalry in support, but it was also caught in [[Umbria]] and annihilated. Like after all previous engagements, the captured enemies were sorted according to whether they were Romans, who were held captive, or non-Romans, who were released to spread the propaganda that the Carthaginian army was in Italy to fight for their freedom against the Romans. Strategically, Hannibal had now disposed of the only field force that could check his advance on Rome but he did not attack the city. Instead, he marched to the south in the hope of winning over allies amongst the [[Magna Graecia|Greek]] and [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] population there.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=285}}\n\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n2.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of frieze showing the equipment of a soldier in the [[maniple (military unit)|manipular]] Roman legion (left).

As the year wore on, Hannibal decided that it would be unwise to winter in the already devastated plains of Campania but Fabius had ensured that all the mountain passes offering an exit were blocked. This situation led to the [[Battle of Ager Falernus|night battle of Ager Falernus]] in which the Carthaginians made good their escape by tricking the Romans into believing that they were heading to the heights above them.{{sfn|Fronda|2011|p=245}} This was a severe blow to Fabius\u2019 prestige.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2011|p=285}}\n\n[[File:Sg0542.jpg|thumb|right|Roman coin issued during the Second Punic war showing (obverse) the god of war [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and (reverse) image of a Roman cavalryman of the time.

As soon as he scored a minor success, by winning a skirmish with the Carthaginians near Geronium, the Senate promoted Minucius to the same ''[[imperium]]'' (power of command) as Fabius, whom he accused of cowardice. In consequence, the two men decided to split the army between them. Minucius' troops were swiftly lured into an ambush and decimated by Hannibal at the [[Battle of Geronium]].

In the spring of 216 BC, he took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at [[Cannae]] in the Apulian plain.

Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed King [[Hieronymus of Syracuse]], and [[Taranto|Tarentum]] also came over to him around that time. Hannibal refused to attack Rome after Cannae. The Romans looked back on Hannibal's indecision as what saved Rome from certain defeat. Hannibal merely sent a delegation to Rome to negotiate a peace and another one offering to release his Roman prisoners of war for ransom, but Rome rejected all offers.{{sfn|Fronda|2011|p=249}}\n\n[[File:Second Punic war.png|thumb|left|300px|Hannibal's allies in Italy.]]\nAfter Cannae, several south Italian cities allied themselves to Hannibal: the [[Apulia]]n towns of [[Salapia]], [[Arpi]] and [[Ordona|Herdonia]] and many of the [[Lucania]]ns.

Simultaneously, Hannibal marched north with part of his forces and was joined by the [[Hirpini]] and the [[Caudini]], two of the three [[Samnium|Samnite]] cantons. The greatest gain was the second largest city of Italy, [[Capua]], when Hannibal's army marched into [[Campania]] in 216 BC. The inhabitants of Capua held limited Roman citizenship and the aristocracy was linked to the Romans via marriage and friendship, but the possibility of becoming the supreme city of Italy after the evident Roman disasters proved too strong a temptation. The treaty between them and Hannibal can be described as an agreement of friendship, since the Capuans had no obligations, but provided the harbour through which Hannibal was reinforced.<ref>Hoyos 122f</ref>\n\nIn 216 BC, another disaster struck Rome as the consul-elect for 215, [[Lucius Postumius Albinus (consul 234 BC)|Lucius Postumius Albinus]] was ambushed along with his 25,000 soldiers by Boii Gauls northwest of Ariminum at the [[Battle of Silva Litana]].

Hannibal repeatedly tried to take this city by assault or siege, but was thwarted three times, in [[Battle of Nola (216 BC)|216]], [[Battle of Nola (215 BC)|215]] and [[Battle of Nola (214 BC)|214]], by forces led by [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]. In 215, Hannibal besieged and starved [[Casilinum]] into submission, the other important site for controlling Campania.{{sfn|Rawlings|2011|p=301}}\n\nThe first Carthaginian expedition to [[Sardinia]], in 215 BC, was under the command of [[Hasdrubal The Bald]] with his Punic-Sardinian subordinate [[Hampsicora]].{{sfn|Barcel\u00f3|2011|p=365}} A previous pro-Carthaginian uprising had been defeated, while a storm had blown the Carthaginian fleet to the [[Balearic Islands]].<ref name=\"Livy\" />{{rp|23.24}} When they finally arrived at Sardinia, the Romans were aware of their intentions and had reinforced the unpopular garrison under [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (dictator)|Titus Manlius Torquatus]] to 20,000 infantry and 1,200 cavalry. These engaged and defeated the Carthaginians' 12,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry (plus an unknown number of elephants) and the remaining insurgent [[Sardinians]] at the [[Battle of Cornus]]. In the aftermath, the defeated expedition of 60 quinqueremes and several transports encountered a Roman raiding party from Africa with 100 quinqueremes. The Carthaginian fleet scattered and escaped save for seven ships.

His subordinate Hanno was able to raise troops in [[Samnium]], but the Romans intercepted these new levies in the [[Battle of Beneventum (214 BC)]] and eliminated them before they came under the leadership of Hannibal. Hannibal could win allies, but defending them against the Romans was a new and difficult problem, as the Romans could still field multiple armies greatly outnumbering his own forces. Thus Fabius was able to take the Carthaginian ally [[Arpi]] in 213 BC.{{sfn|Rawlings|2011|p=312}}\n\n====Africa (213 BC)====\nWhile the Romans made little progress in the Iberian theatre, the Scipios were able to negotiate a new front in Africa by allying themselves with [[Syphax]], a powerful [[Numidians|Numidian]] king in North Africa.{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=322}} In 213 BC, he received Roman advisers to train his heavy infantry soldiers that had not yet been able to stand up to their Carthaginian counterparts.{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=322}} With this support, he waged war against the Carthaginian ally [[List of Kings of Numidia#Kings of Eastern Numidia|Gala]].{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=322}} According to [[Appian]], in 213 BC [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]] left Iberia and fought Syphax, though history may have confused him with [[Hasdrubal Gisco]]; however, it did tie down Carthaginian resources.{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=322}}<ref>Hoyos 139</ref> Hasdrubal Gisco is the son of the Gesco who had served together with Hamilcar Barca, Hannibal's father, in Sicily during the First Punic War and son-in-law of [[Hanno the Elder]] who was one of Hannibal's lieutenants in Italy.{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=322}}\n\n====Sicily (213\u2013212 BC)====\n[[File:Archimedes and Hiero of Syracuse.jpg|thumb|Hiero of Syracuse calls Archimedes to fortify the city.

Hannibal was aided by the fact that [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], the old tyrant of Syracuse and a staunch Roman ally, had died and his successor [[Hieronymus of Syracuse|Hieronymus]] was discontented with his position in the Roman alliance. Hannibal dispatched two of his lieutenants, who were of Syracusian origin, to negotiate with [[Hieronymus of Syracuse|Hieronymus]]. They succeeded in winning Syracuse over, at the price, however, of making the whole of Sicily a Syracusan possession. The Syracusans' ambitions were great, but the army they fielded was no match for the arriving Roman force, leading to the [[Siege of Syracuse (213\u2013212 BC)|Siege of Syracuse]] from 213 BC onwards.{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=327}}\n\nThe Siege of Syracuse from 213 BC onwards, was marked by [[Archimedes]]' ingenuity in inventing war machines that made it impossible for the Romans to make any gains with traditional methods of siege warfare.{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=328}} It was imperative for the Romans to maintain control over Sicily, for otherwise the Carthaginians would be able to reinforce Hannibal in southern Italy with impunity.{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=321}} The Roman commitment would be matched by the Carthaginians.{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=327}}\n\nA Carthaginian army of 25,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry and 12 elephants under Himilco was sent to relieve the city in 213, landing at and capturing [[Heraclea Minoa]] and followed up by taking [[Agrigentum]].{{sfn|Edwell|2011|p=329}} Himilco began taking over Roman-garrisoned towns in Sicily. The Roman garrison at [[Morgantina]] was betrayed from within, while the Roman garrison commander at nearby [[Enna]] heard of Morgantina's treachery and massacred Enna's civilian population.

The [[Battle of Tarentum (212 BC)]] was a carefully planned coup by Hannibal and members of the city's democratic faction. There were two separate successful assaults on the gates of the city. This enabled the Carthaginian army, which had approached unobserved behind a screen of marauding Numidian horsemen, to enter the city by surprise and take all but the citadel where the Romans and their supporting faction were able to rally. The Carthaginians failed to take the citadel, but subsequent fortifications around this Roman stronghold put the city under Carthaginian control. However, the harbour was blocked and warships had to be transported overland to be launched at sea.\n\nThe [[Battle of Capua (212 BC)]] was a stalemate. The Romans decided to end the siege of Capua. As a result, the Capuan cavalry was reinforced with half of the available Numidian cavalry of 2,000.\n\nIn the [[Battle of Beneventum (212 BC)]], Hanno the Elder was again defeated, this time by [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus]], who also captured his camp.{{sfn|Rawlings|2011|p=316}} In the following [[Battle of the Silarus]], in the same year, the Romans under Marcus Centenius were ambushed and lost all but 1,000 of their 16,000 effectives.{{sfn|Rawlings|2011|p=301}} Also, in 212 BC, the [[Battle of Herdonia (212 BC)|Battle of Herdonia]] resulted in another Roman defeat, with only 2,000 Romans out of a force of 18,000 surviving a direct attack by Hannibal's numerically superior forces, combined with an ambush that cut off the Roman line of retreat.{{sfn|Hoyos|2011|p=85}}{{sfn|Fronda|2011|p=253}}\n\nDuring the Roman [[Siege of Capua (211 BC)]], Hannibal again tried to regain use of his main harbour as in the previous year, by luring the Romans into a pitched battle. He was unsuccessful, and was also unable to lift the siege by assaulting the besiegers' defences. So he tried a strategem of staging a march towards Rome, hoping in this way to compel the enemy to abandon the siege and rush to defend their home city. However, only part of the besieging force left for Rome and, under continued siege, Capua fell to Rome soon afterwards.

The legions in Sicily were mainly the survivors of Cannae, who were not allowed home until the war was finished. Scipio was also one of the survivors but, unlike the ordinary soldiers, had been allowed to return to Rome along with the other surviving [[Military tribune|tribunes]], and had run successfully for public office and had been given command of the troops in Iberia.\n\nAfter landing in Africa, Scipio besieged and failed to take the city of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] in the [[Siege of Utica (204 BC)]]. When a Carthaginian and Numidian relief army under [[Hasdrubal Barca]] and [[Syphax]] moved to confront Scipio, the Romans mounted a surprise attack on their enemies at the [[Battle of Utica (203 BC)]] and defeated them with complete success. Scipio broke out into the Carthaginian hinterland and a second Carthaginian-Numidian army was attacked and destroyed at the [[Battle of the Great Plains]] in 203 BC. King Syphax of the [[Masaesyli|Massaesylians]] (western Numidians), was defeated and taken prisoner after the [[Battle of Cirta]]. [[Masinissa]], a Numidian rival of Syphax and, at that time, an ally of the Romans, seized a large part of his kingdom with their help. These setbacks persuaded some in the Carthaginian Senate that it was time to sue for peace. Others pleaded for the recall of Hannibal and Mago, who were still fighting the Romans in Bruttium and [[Cisalpine Gaul]], respectively.\n\n====Italy (204\u2013203 BC)====\nIn 205, Mago landed in [[Genoa|Genua]] by sea the remnants of his Spanish army. This was the third Carthaginian force invading Italy. It soon received Gallic and Ligurian reinforcements. Mago's arrival in the north of the Italian peninsula was followed by Hannibal's [[Battle of Crotona]] in 204 in the south of the peninsula. Mago marched his reinforced army towards the lands of the Boii and Insubres, Carthage's main Gallic allies and a place of retreat for Hasdrubal's defeated remnants. His move was checked by four Roman legions and allies under Publius Varus and [[Marcus Cornelius Cethegus]] at the [[Battle of Insubria]] in 203. This hindered the third attempted invasion of Italy early, by preventing Mago from uniting with Hannibal's army in the south.\n\n===End of the war (202\u2013201 BC)===\nIn 203 BC, while [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] was carrying all before him in Africa and the Carthaginian peace party were arranging an [[armistice]], Hannibal was recalled from Italy by the war party at Carthage. After leaving a record of his expedition engraved in [[Punic language|Punic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] upon bronze tablets in the temple of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] at [[Crotone]], he sailed back to Africa. These records were later quoted by [[Polybius]]. Hannibal's arrival immediately restored the predominance of the war party, who placed him in command of a combined force of Mediterranean mercenaries, African [[Conscription#Medieval levies|levies]] and his veterans from Italy. In 202 BC, Hannibal met Scipio in a peace conference. Despite the two generals' mutual admiration, negotiations floundered, according to the Romans due to \"Punic faith\", meaning bad faith. This Roman expression referred to the alleged breach of protocols which ended the [[First Punic War]] by the Carthaginian attack on Saguntum, Hannibal's perceived breaches of what the Romans perceived as military etiquette (i.e., Hannibal's numerous ambuscades), as well as the armistice violated by the Carthaginians in the period before Hannibal's return.\n\n[[File:Schlacht bei Zama Gem\u00e4lde H P Motte.jpg|thumb|Carthaginian war elephants engage Roman infantry at the Battle of Zama (202 BC).]]\n\nThe decisive [[Battle of Zama]] soon followed. Unlike most battles of the Second Punic War, the Romans had superiority in cavalry and the Carthaginians had superiority in infantry.\nScipio countered an expected Carthaginian elephant charge, which caused some of Hannibal's elephants to turn back into his own ranks, throwing his cavalry into disarray. The Roman cavalry was able to capitalize on this and drive the Carthaginian cavalry from the field. The battle remained closely fought and, at one point, it seemed that Hannibal was on the verge of victory. Scipio's cavalry then returned from chasing the Carthaginian cavalry and attacked Hannibal's rear. This two-pronged attack caused the Carthaginian formation to disintegrate and collapse.

Rome imposed a war indemnity<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/punic-wars | title=Punic Wars}}</ref> of 10,000 silver [[talent (weight)|talents]] (300 [[tonne]]s/660,000 pounds), limited the Carthaginian navy to 10 ships (to ward off pirates), and forbade Carthage from raising an army without Roman permission. The Numidians took the opportunity to capture and plunder Carthaginian territory. Half a century later, when Carthage raised an army to defend itself from these incursions, Rome destroyed her in the [[Third Punic War]] (149\u2013146 BC). Rome, on the other hand, by her victory, had taken a key step towards what ultimately became her domination of the [[Mediterranean]] world.\n\nThe end of the war did not meet with a universal welcome in Rome. When the Senate decided upon a peace treaty with Carthage, [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus (died 175 BC)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], a former consul, said he did not look upon the termination of the war as a blessing to Rome, since he feared that the Roman people would now sink back again into its former slumbers, from which it had been roused by the presence of Hannibal.<ref>[[Valerius Maximus]] vii. 2. \u00a73.\n</ref> Others, most notably [[Cato the Elder]], feared that if Carthage was not completely destroyed it would soon regain its power and pose new threats to Rome; he pressed for harsher peace conditions. Even after the peace, Cato insisted on the destruction of Carthage, ending all his speeches with [[Carthago delenda est|\"Carthage must be destroyed\"]], even if they had nothing to do with Carthage.<ref>[[Plutarch]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html Life of Cato]</ref>\n\nArchaeology has discovered that the famous circular military harbour at Carthage, the [[Cothon]], received a significant buildup during or after this war. Though shielded from external sight, it could house and quickly deploy about 200 [[triremes]]. This appears a surprising development as, after the war, one of the terms of surrender restricted the Carthaginian fleet to only ten triremes. One possible explanation: as has been pointed out for other Phoenician cities, [[privateer]]s with warships played a significant role besides trade, even when the Roman Empire was fully established and officially controlled all coasts. In this case it is not clear whether the treaty included private warships. The only reference to Carthaginian privateers comes from the First Punic War: one such privateer, Hanno the Rhodian, owned a [[quinquereme]] (faster than the serial production models that the Romans had copied), manned with about 500 men and then among the heaviest warships in use. Later pirates in Roman waters are all reported with much smaller vessels, which could outrun naval vessels, but operated with lower personnel costs. Thus piracy was probably highly developed in Carthage and the state did not have a monopoly of military forces. Pirates probably played an important role in capturing slaves, one of the most profitable trade-goods, but merchant ships with tradeable goods and a crew were also their targets. No surviving source reports the fate of Carthaginian privateers in the periods between and after the Punic Wars.\n\nHannibal became a businessman for several years and later enjoyed a leadership role in Carthage. However, the Carthaginian nobility, upset by his policy of democratisation and his struggle against corruption, persuaded the Romans to force him into exile in [[Asia Minor]], where he again led armies against the Romans and their allies on the battlefield. He eventually committed suicide (c. 182 BC) to avoid capture.\n\nConstant low-level warfare persisted between Carthage and Numidia, but, by the time of the [[Third Punic War]] (149\u2013146 BC), Carthage had lost most of its African territories and the Numidians traded independently with the Greeks.\n\n==Intelligence==\nIn this conflict, intelligence played an important role on both sides. Hannibal mastered an intelligence service that enabled him to achieve outstanding victories.<ref>Zlattner 1997</ref> Likewise, Scipio Africanus Major's victories depended on information. In 217 BC, a Carthaginian resident spy in Rome\u2014probably a Roman citizen\u2014was caught and had his hands cut off as a punishment.<ref name=\"Livy\" />{{rp|22.33.1}}<ref>Austin&Rankov 1995, p. 93</ref>\n\n==Opinions on the war==\n[[Livy]] portrayed the Punic War as <blockquote>\"the most memorable of all wars that were ever waged: the war which the Carthaginians, under the conduct of Hannibal, maintained with the Roman people. For never did any states and nations more efficient in their resources engage in contest; nor had they themselves at any other period so great a degree of power and energy. They brought into action too no arts of war unknown to each other, but those which had been tried in the [[first Punic war]]; and so various was the fortune of the conflict, and so doubtful the victory, that they who conquered were more exposed to danger. The hatred with which they fought also was almost greater than their resources.\"<ref name=\"Livy\" />\n{{rp|21.1}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* [[G. A. Henty]]'s 1887 historical novel ''The Young Carthaginian'' tells the story of [[Hannibal]] and the Second Punic War from the perspective of the fictional character Malchus, a cousin of Hannibal.\n* Hannibal's exploits, as well as those of Archimedes and the siege of Syracuse, appear dramatically reenacted in the classic Italian silent film ''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914).\n* The BBC TV Series ''On Hannibal's Trail'' screened in 2009.\n* The [[Scipio Africanus trilogy]] is a historical fiction by [[Santiago Posteguillo]] that describes in detail the history of the multiple conflicts between [[Hannibal]] and [[Scipio Africanus]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Socii]]\n* [[Equestrian order]]\n* [[Carthaginian peace]]\n* [[Hannibal]]\n* [[Scipio Africanus Major]]\n* [[War elephant]]\n* [[Barcid]]\n* [[List of battles of the Second Punic War]]\n* [[Polybius]] wrote a detailed history, showing contemporary insight into the political process of this time.\n* [[Silius Italicus]], who dramatised the war in his poem ''[[Punica (poem)|Punica]]''\n* [[Petrarch]], who wrote an epic on the war entitled ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]''\n* [[Plutarch's Lives]] for lives of two of the Roman generals, [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Fabius Maximus]] and [[Gaius Flaminius]].

While TWU has been fully co-educational since 1994, it is the largest state-supported [[List of current and historical women's universities and colleges in the United States|university primarily for women in the United States]]. TWU is one of [[List of colleges and universities in Texas#Independent public universities|four independent public universities]] in Texas not affiliated with one of the public university systems in the state. It currently offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in 60 areas of study across six colleges.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hornaday 1975 1007 (15899965506).jpg|left|thumb|440x440px|Early class of students in a physical education program]]\nIn the late nineteenth century, several Texas-based groups (including the [[Press Women of Texas|Texas Press Women's Association]], the [[Texas Federation of Women's Clubs]], the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]], and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kct37|title=Texas Women's University|last=Thompson|first=Joyce|date=15 June 2010|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|access-date=5 April 2016}}</ref>) began advocating for the creation of a state-supported women's college focused on a practical education, including domestic skills young women would need to prepare as wives and mothers. In 1901, after the state Democratic Party adopted the idea as a platform in the upcoming election, the college's establishment was authorized by the [[Texas Legislature]]. Originally named the Texas Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Girls of the State of Texas in the Arts and Sciences, it opened in Denton in 1902 with a class of 186 students and 14 faculty. With three women on its inaugural board of regents, they became the first women to sit on the governing board of a Texas university. The school was soon renamed the Girls Industrial College in 1903 and conferred its first degrees the following year.<ref>Sayles' Annotated Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, Title 86, Chapter 5a, 1908</ref> In 1905, the name changed again to the College of Industrial Arts and expanded its programs to include liberal arts, fine arts, and sciences.\n\nUpon its founding, the school was primarily focused on rural and small town women seeking vocational training. Since many areas of the state lacked comprehensive high schools, the first two years of CIA's curriculum were preparatory; students enrolling with a high school degree were automatically admitted to the college as juniors. With its home extension program and summer school, the school was the first in Texas to offer instruction in home economics, supplying an overwhelming majority of the state's high school teachers in home economics in the early twentieth century. In 1914, CIA implemented its first four-year college curriculum, and the first bachelor's degrees were conferred in 1915. By 1929, the college had expanded its programs sufficiently to be accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools|Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]], the [[American Association of University Women]], and the [[Association of American Universities]], and it began offering its first master's degrees in 1930.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kct37|title=TEXAS WOMAN'S UNIVERSITY|last=JOYCE|first=THOMPSON|date=2010-06-15|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}</ref> In 1934, the school underwent another name change to the Texas State College for Women (TSCW) to reflect its growing reputation as a premiere institution of higher education for women in the state.\n[[File:Texas Woman's University September 2015 08 (Ann Stuart Science Complex).jpg|left|thumb|Ann Stuart Science Complex]]\nDespite the social and cultural limitations for professional women at the time, the college pioneered several academic programs to meet the needs of a growing postwar economy in Texas and built a national reputation for its programs and research in textiles, food, and nutrition, awarding the college's first doctoral degrees in 1953. In 1950, it also developed the first nationally accredited nursing program in the state, opening at the original [[Parkland Hospital]] in downtown Dallas in 1954, and joining the Oak Ridge Institute for Nuclear Studies in the 1960s, receiving a series of research grants from the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] to study the health effects on humans in space flights. In 1956, it established the first building in Texas dedicated solely to the instruction of library sciences. Finally, in 1957, the school changed its name for the fourth time to Texas Woman's University, and expanded its health sciences programs to a campus in Houston in 1960. \nThe college also enjoyed a close relationship with [[Texas A&M University]] in College Station in the early and mid-twentieth century. As the only gender segregated public colleges in Texas at the time, the schools generated considerable media attention for their institutional-supported fraternizing at major sporting and social events; for several decades, a \"Tessie\" was named the \"Aggie Sweetheart\" at A&M's football rivalry matchup. The practice fizzled in the 1970s when each school began admitting both male and female students, although the schools do still collaborate in several academic and service programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aggienetwork.com/media/guides/texas%20aggie/2016/tessies%20from%20txag0116_final_full%20v1.pdf|title=Gig 'Em, Tessies: Harking Back To A Flirting Time Between Texas A&M And TSCW|last=Stephenson|first=Lane|date=January\u2013February 2016|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\nLike most non-HBCU institutions in Texas, the school originally admitted only white students.

In 1994, in anticipation of changing protocols of single-gender institutions across the United States such as [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|the Citadel]] and Mississippi College for Women, the school opened all of its programs to qualified men.\n\nDespite being a co-educational university since 1972, TWU remains overwhelmingly women, with approximately 90% of the student body identifying as such, and it continues to place a heavy emphasis on meeting the educational needs of [[women]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/colleges/texas-womans-university/|title=Texas Woman's University|accessdate=18 February 2017}}</ref> It remains unique among Texas higher education institutions by requiring all undergraduates, regardless of their proposed major or degree, to take three credit hours of multicultural women's studies in order to graduate.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Texas Woman's University September 2015 04 (Old Main Building).jpg|alt=|thumb|Old Main Building]]\nThe university's main campus consists of 270 acres in Denton, Texas, approximately forty miles northwest of Dallas. Upon the university's founding, the Old Main Building was constructed in 1902 and housed all of the school's academic programs and students. The first dormitory opened in 1907, and a second classroom building was constructed in 1911.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], college president L.H.

In 1901, after the state Democratic Party adopted the idea as a platform in the upcoming election, the college's establishment was authorized by the [[Texas Legislature]]. Originally named the Texas Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Girls of the State of Texas in the Arts and Sciences, it opened in Denton in 1902 with a class of 186 students and 14 faculty. With three women on its inaugural board of regents, they became the first women to sit on the governing board of a Texas university. The school was soon renamed the Girls Industrial College in 1903 and conferred its first degrees the following year.<ref>Sayles' Annotated Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, Title 86, Chapter 5a, 1908</ref> In 1905, the name changed again to the College of Industrial Arts and expanded its programs to include liberal arts, fine arts, and sciences.\n\nUpon its founding, the school was primarily focused on rural and small town women seeking vocational training. Since many areas of the state lacked comprehensive high schools, the first two years of CIA's curriculum were preparatory; students enrolling with a high school degree were automatically admitted to the college as juniors. With its home extension program and summer school, the school was the first in Texas to offer instruction in home economics, supplying an overwhelming majority of the state's high school teachers in home economics in the early twentieth century. In 1914, CIA implemented its first four-year college curriculum, and the first bachelor's degrees were conferred in 1915. By 1929, the college had expanded its programs sufficiently to be accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools|Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]], the [[American Association of University Women]], and the [[Association of American Universities]], and it began offering its first master's degrees in 1930.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kct37|title=TEXAS WOMAN'S UNIVERSITY|last=JOYCE|first=THOMPSON|date=2010-06-15|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}</ref> In 1934, the school underwent another name change to the Texas State College for Women (TSCW) to reflect its growing reputation as a premiere institution of higher education for women in the state.\n[[File:Texas Woman's University September 2015 08 (Ann Stuart Science Complex).jpg|left|thumb|Ann Stuart Science Complex]]\nDespite the social and cultural limitations for professional women at the time, the college pioneered several academic programs to meet the needs of a growing postwar economy in Texas and built a national reputation for its programs and research in textiles, food, and nutrition, awarding the college's first doctoral degrees in 1953. In 1950, it also developed the first nationally accredited nursing program in the state, opening at the original [[Parkland Hospital]] in downtown Dallas in 1954, and joining the Oak Ridge Institute for Nuclear Studies in the 1960s, receiving a series of research grants from the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] to study the health effects on humans in space flights. In 1956, it established the first building in Texas dedicated solely to the instruction of library sciences. Finally, in 1957, the school changed its name for the fourth time to Texas Woman's University, and expanded its health sciences programs to a campus in Houston in 1960. \nThe college also enjoyed a close relationship with [[Texas A&M University]] in College Station in the early and mid-twentieth century. As the only gender segregated public colleges in Texas at the time, the schools generated considerable media attention for their institutional-supported fraternizing at major sporting and social events; for several decades, a \"Tessie\" was named the \"Aggie Sweetheart\" at A&M's football rivalry matchup. The practice fizzled in the 1970s when each school began admitting both male and female students, although the schools do still collaborate in several academic and service programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aggienetwork.com/media/guides/texas%20aggie/2016/tessies%20from%20txag0116_final_full%20v1.pdf|title=Gig 'Em, Tessies: Harking Back To A Flirting Time Between Texas A&M And TSCW|last=Stephenson|first=Lane|date=January\u2013February 2016|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\nLike most non-HBCU institutions in Texas, the school originally admitted only white students.

In 1994, in anticipation of changing protocols of single-gender institutions across the United States such as [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|the Citadel]] and Mississippi College for Women, the school opened all of its programs to qualified men.\n\nDespite being a co-educational university since 1972, TWU remains overwhelmingly women, with approximately 90% of the student body identifying as such, and it continues to place a heavy emphasis on meeting the educational needs of [[women]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/colleges/texas-womans-university/|title=Texas Woman's University|accessdate=18 February 2017}}</ref> It remains unique among Texas higher education institutions by requiring all undergraduates, regardless of their proposed major or degree, to take three credit hours of multicultural women's studies in order to graduate.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Texas Woman's University September 2015 04 (Old Main Building).jpg|alt=|thumb|Old Main Building]]\nThe university's main campus consists of 270 acres in Denton, Texas, approximately forty miles northwest of Dallas.

The first dormitory opened in 1907, and a second classroom building was constructed in 1911.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], college president L.H.

His defining career role was the portrayal of Wing Commander [[Guy Gibson]], V.C., in the 1955 cinema film ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]''. \n\n==Early life & career==\nRichard Todd was born as '''Richard Andrew Palethorpe-Todd''' in [[Dublin]], Ireland.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8394812.stm | title=BBC News \u2013 Dam Busters star Richard Todd dies aged 90 | publisher=news.bbc.co.uk | accessdate=4 December 2009 | last= | first= | date=4 December 2009}}</ref> His father, Andrew William Palethorpe Todd, was an Irish physician and an international [[Ireland national rugby union team|Irish rugby]] player who gained three [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for his country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/106920.html|title=Varsity match venues, uncapped Barbarians...|publisher=scrum.com|accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref> Richard spent a few of his childhood years in [[British Raj|India]], where his father, an officer in the [[British Army]], served as a physician.<ref name=\"Obit\"/> Later his family moved to [[Devon]] and Todd attended [[Shrewsbury School]]. \n\nUpon leaving school, Todd trained for a potential military career at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] before beginning his acting training at the [[Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts|Italia Conti Academy]] in London. This change in career led to estrangement from his mother. When he learned at the age of 19 that she had committed suicide, he did not grieve long he admitted in later life.<ref name=\"Obit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/6743553/Richard-Todd.html|title=Richard Todd|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=6 December 2009|accessdate=13 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe first appeared professionally as an actor at the [[Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park]] in 1936 in a production of ''[[Twelfth Night]]''. He played in regional theatres and then co-founded the [[Dundee Repertory Theatre]] in Scotland in 1939. He also appeared as an extra in British films including ''[[Good Morning, Boys]]'' (1937), ''[[A Yank at Oxford]]'' (1938) and ''[[Old Bones of the River]]'' (1939).\n\n[[File:Pegasus Bridge, June 1944 B5288.jpg|thumb|175px|Captain Richard Todd landed near [[Pegasus Bridge]] on 6 June 1944.]]\nTodd enlisted soon after the outbreak of [[World War 2]], entering the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]] in late 1940. On 29 January 1941 he was one of 26 cadets injured when 'D' Block of New College was hit by a German bomb in an attack by the [[Luftwaffe]]. In his memoires he describes seeing the bomb pass through the ceiling in front of him before he was blown out of the building by its blast, landing on a grass bank and suffering multiple lacerations, five cadets were killed in the incident. Todd was commissioned in the Spring of 1941. On the day he received his commission he tried to join several friends at the [[Caf\u00e9 de Paris (London)|Caf\u00e9 de Paris]] in London, but could not get a table booked for the evening. That evening, the venue was destroyed in an air raid, and fifteen newly-commissioned subalterns were killed. \n\nHe served in the [[King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry]] (KOYLI), before joining the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and the [[7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion]] as part of the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 6th Airborne Division]].

Short of transport as they advanced into Germany, Todd, as the Motor Transport Officer, was responsible for gathering a rag tag selection of commandeered vehicles to ferry the troops forward. After VE day, the Division returned to the UK for a few weeks before being sent on counter-insurgency operations in Palestine. Todd finally returned to the UK to be demobbed in 1946.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Caught in the act : the story of my life.|last=Todd, Richard.|date=1986|publisher=Hutchinson|isbn=0-09-163800-3|oclc=982188986}}</ref>\n\nDuring the operation he met [[John Howard (British Army officer)|John Howard]] on the bridge and was subsequently involved in helping to repulse counter-attacks by the [[Wehrmacht]] forces in the area.

His former agent, Robert Lennard, had become a casting agent for [[Associated British Picture Corporation]] and advised him to try out for the Dundee Repertory Company. Todd did so, performing in plays such as ''Claudia'', where he appeared with Catherine Grant-Bogle. Lennard arranged for a screen test and Associated British offered him a long-term contract in 1948. He was cast in the lead in ''[[For Them That Trespass]]'' (1949), directed by [[Alberto Cavalcanti]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47223206 |title=Richard Todd is newest find for British films. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=9 July 1949 |accessdate=25 July 2012 |page=38 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The film was a minor hit and Todd's career was launched.<ref>Nepean, E.

Lachlan McLachlan. This led to his being cast in that role in the [[Warner Bros.]] [[The Hasty Heart|film adaptation of the play]], which was filmed in [[UK|Britain]] alongside [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Patricia Neal]].

He was lent out to a new company, Constellation Films, to appear in a thriller, ''[[The Interrupted Journey]]'' (1949). [[Alfred Hitchcock]] then used him in ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' (1950), opposite [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Jane Wyman]] \u2013 Hitchcock's first British film located in Britain since 1939.\n\nAssociated British put him in a drama, ''[[Portrait of Clare]]'' (1950), which did not perform particularly well at the box office. Neither did ''[[Flesh and Blood (1951 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'' (1951), for London Films, in which Todd had a dual role. Director [[King Vidor]] offered Todd a lead in a Hollywood movie,  ''[[Lightning Strikes Twice (1951 film)|Lightning Strikes Twice]]'' (1951). Far more popular was ''[[The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men]]'' (1952), in which Todd played the title role for the Disney Corporation.\n\nAssociated British put him in another thriller, ''[[24 Hours of a Woman's Life]]'' (1952), with [[Merle Oberon]]. The Rank Organisation borrowed him for a thriller, ''[[Venetian Bird]]'' (1952), directed by [[Ralph Thomas]].\n\nDisney reunited the ''Robin Hood'' team in ''[[The Sword and the Rose]]'' (1953), with Todd as [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk]]. It was not as popular as ''Robin Hood'' in the US but performed well in Europe. The same went for Disney's, ''[[Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue]]'' (1953), in which Todd played the title role. Disney pulled back on making costume films as a result.<ref>Disney Reports Income Gain Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 4 June 1954: A7.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, he appeared in a [[BBC Television]] adaptation of the novel ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', as Heathcliff. [[Nigel Kneale]], responsible for the adaptation, said the production came about purely because Todd had turned up at the BBC and told them that he would like to play Heathcliff for them. Kneale had to write the script in only a week as the broadcast was rushed into production.<ref name=\"kneale\">{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Andy |title=Into the Unknown: The Fantastic Life of Nigel Kneale|type=paperback|year=2006|location=London|publisher=[[Headpress]]|isbn=978-1-900486-50-7|page=34}}</ref>\n\nTodd's career received a boost when [[20th Century-Fox]] signed him to a non-exclusive contract and cast him as the United States Senate Chaplain [[Peter Marshall (preacher)|Peter Marshall]] in the [[A Man Called Peter|film version]] of [[Catherine Marshall]]'s best selling biography, ''[[Peter Marshall (preacher)|A Man Called Peter]]'' (1955), which was a popular success.\n\nEven more popular was ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1955) in which Todd played [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Guy Gibson]]. This was the most successful film at the British box office in 1955<ref>\"'The Dam Busters'.\" ''Times'' [London, England], 29 December 1955, p. 12, via ''The Times Digital Archive''. Retrieved: 11 July 2012.</ref>  and which would become the defining role of Todd's movie career.\n\n20th Century Fox offered Todd another historical picture, ''[[The Virgin Queen (1955 film)|The Virgin Queen]]'' (1955), playing [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] opposite [[Bette Davis]]' [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. It did not do as well as ''Peter''.\n\nIn France he played [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Axel Fersen]] opposite [[Mich\u00e8le Morgan]] in ''[[Marie Antoinette Queen of France]]'' (1956), which was popular in France but not widely seen elsewhere. Fox cast him in a war film, ''[[D-Day the Sixth of June]]'' (1956), opposite Robert Taylor, which was a mild success.\n\n''[[Yangtse Incident: The Story of H.M.S. Amethyst]]'' (1957) was an attempt to repeat the success of ''The Dam Busters'', with the same director (Michael Anderson) and Todd playing another real life hero. It was popular in Britain but not on the scale of ''The Dam Busters''. He was [[Jean de Dunois|Dunois, Bastard of Orl\u00e9ans]] in ''[[Saint Joan (1957 film)|Saint Joan]]'' (1957), directed by [[Otto Preminger]].\n\n''[[Chase a Crooked Shadow]]'' (1958) was a thriller with director Anderson for Associated British. ''[[Intent to Kill]]'' (1958) was another thriller, this time for Fox, with [[Betsy Drake]]. He returned to war films with ''[[Danger Within]]'' (1958), a POW story. Then there were more thrillers, with ''[[Never Let Go]]'' (1960), directed by [[John Guillermin]] and co-starring [[Peter Sellers]] in a rare dramatic role.\n\nFew of these films had been overly popular but Todd was still the top billed star of ''[[The Long and the Short and the Tall (film)|The Long and the Short and the Tall]]'' (1961), with Laurence Harvey and Richard Harris. He tried comedy with ''[[Don't Bother to Knock (1961 film)|Don't Bother to Knock]]'' (1961), then made an adventure film in South Africa, ''[[The Hellions (film)|The Hellions]]'' (1961).\n\nTodd's cinema career rapidly declined in the 1960s as the [[counter-culture]] movement in the Arts became fashionable in England, with [[British New Wave|social-realist]] dramas commercially replacing the more middle-class orientated dramatic productions that Todd's performance character-type had previously excelled in.\n\n''[[The Boys (1962 British film)|The Boys]]'' (1962) was a courtroom drama film in which Todd played the lead prosecuting barrister. He had a good part among the many stars in ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), playing Major John Howard during the paratroop action before D-Day in which he himself had taken part in 1944 (another actor portrayed Todd); this was his biggest hit for some time. He appeared in ''[[The Very Edge]]'' (1963), a thriller, then he played Harry Sanders in two films for [[Harry Alan Towers]]: ''[[Death Drums Along the River]]'' (1965) and ''[[Coast of Skeletons]]'' (1965). He also had a small role in Anderson's ''[[Operation Crossbow (film)|Operation Crossbow]]'' (1965).\n\nIn 1964 he was a member of the jury at the [[14th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale 1964\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1964/04_jury_1964/04_Jury_1964.html |title=Berlinale 1964: Juries |accessdate=16 February 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nHe had a supporting part in ''[[The Battle of the Villa Fiorita]]'' (1965) and the lead in ''[[The Love-Ins]]'' (1968).\n\nIn the 1970s, he gained new fans when he appeared as the reader for Radio Four's ''Morning Story''. In the 1980s his distinctive voice was heard as narrator of ''Wings Over the World'', a thirteen-part documentary series about the history of aviation shown on Arts & Entertainment television. He appeared before the camera in the episode about the [[Lancaster bomber]]. Todd continued to act on television, including roles in ''[[Virtual Murder (TV series)|Virtual Murder]]''; ''[[Silent Witness]]'' and in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[Kinda (Doctor Who)|\"Kinda\"]]'' in 1982. In 1989 he appeared in the first episode of the sixth season of the television [[whodunit]] ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' in which he played Colonel Alex Schofield in the episode entitled [[List of Murder, She Wrote episodes#Season 6 (1989\u201390)|\"Appointment in Athens\"]].\n\nHe formed Triumph Theatre Productions with [[Duncan Weldon (producer)|Duncan C. Weldon]] and Paul Elliott in the late 1960s. This company produced more than 100 plays, musicals and pantomimes all over the country; some of them starred Todd.\n\nHis acting career extended into his eighties, and he made several appearances in British shows such as [[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]] and ''[[The Royal]]''. He appeared in The Royal as Hugh Hurst, a retired solicitor, in the episode \"Kiss and Tell\" (2003); his last appearance in Heartbeat was as Major Harold Beecham in the 2007 episode [[Heartbeat (series 11\u201318)#Series 16 (2006\u20132007)|\"Seeds of Destruction\"]].\n\nRichard Todd was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1993.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?participantId=192516 TCM]</ref>\n\nHe was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on two occasions: in March 1960 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]]; and in November 1988 when [[Michael Aspel]] surprised him on stage at the [[Theatre Royal Windsor]].\n\n===Unmade projects===\nTodd was the first choice of author [[Ian Fleming]] to play [[James Bond]] in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', but a scheduling conflict gave the role to [[Sean Connery]]. In the 1960s, Todd unsuccessfully attempted to produce a film of Ian Fleming's ''[[The Diamond Smugglers]]''<ref name=caught/> and a television series based on true accounts of the [[Queen's Messenger]]s.<ref name=caught/> He was also announced for a proposed film about [[William Shakespeare]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55851326 |title=Hope tops list for popularity. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=30 December 1950 |accessdate=10 July 2012 |page=5 Supplement: Sunday Magazine |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''British Film Character Actors'' (1982), Terence Pettigrew described Todd as \"an actor who made the most of what he had, which could be summed up as an inability to sit still while there was a horse to leap astride, a swollen river to swim or a tree to vanish into.\"\n\n==Personal life==\nBoth Todd's marriages ended in divorce. His first wife was actress Catherine Grant-Bogle, whom he met in Dundee Repertory and was married to from 1949 until 1970; they had a son Peter (1952\u20132005) and a daughter Fiona. In 1960 he had a son Jeremy with model Patricia Nelson. He was married to model Virginia Mailer from 1970 until 1992; they had two sons, Andrew and Seumas (1977\u20131997).<ref>[http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp Deaths England and Wales 1984\u20132006]</ref> \n\nIn retirement, Todd lived in the village of [[Little Ponton]] and later in [[Little Humby]], 8 miles from [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]].\n\nTwo of Todd's five children died by suicide. In 1997, Seumas Palethorpe-Todd shot himself in the head at the family home in Lincolnshire; an inquest determined that the suicide might have been a depressive reaction to the drug he was taking for severe acne.

He played in regional theatres and then co-founded the [[Dundee Repertory Theatre]] in Scotland in 1939. He also appeared as an extra in British films including ''[[Good Morning, Boys]]'' (1937), ''[[A Yank at Oxford]]'' (1938) and ''[[Old Bones of the River]]'' (1939).\n\n[[File:Pegasus Bridge, June 1944 B5288.jpg|thumb|175px|Captain Richard Todd landed near [[Pegasus Bridge]] on 6 June 1944.]]\nTodd enlisted soon after the outbreak of [[World War 2]], entering the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]] in late 1940. On 29 January 1941 he was one of 26 cadets injured when 'D' Block of New College was hit by a German bomb in an attack by the [[Luftwaffe]]. In his memoires he describes seeing the bomb pass through the ceiling in front of him before he was blown out of the building by its blast, landing on a grass bank and suffering multiple lacerations, five cadets were killed in the incident. Todd was commissioned in the Spring of 1941. On the day he received his commission he tried to join several friends at the [[Caf\u00e9 de Paris (London)|Caf\u00e9 de Paris]] in London, but could not get a table booked for the evening. That evening venue was destroyed in an air raid, and fifteen newly-commissioned subalterns were killed. \n\nHe served in the [[King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry]] (KOYLI), before joining the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and the [[7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion]] as part of the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 6th Airborne Division]].

Short of transport as they advanced into Germany, Todd, as the Motor Transport Officer, was responsible for gathering a rag tag selection of commandeered vehicles to ferry the troops forward. After VE day, the Division returned to the UK for a few weeks before being sent on counter-insurgency operations in Palestine. Todd finally returned to the UK to be demobbed in 1946.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Caught in the act : the story of my life.|last=Todd, Richard.|date=1986|publisher=Hutchinson|isbn=0-09-163800-3|oclc=982188986}}</ref>\n\nDuring the operation he met [[John Howard (British Army officer)|John Howard]] on the bridge and was subsequently involved in helping to repulse counter-attacks by the [[Wehrmacht]] forces in the area.

His former agent, Robert Lennard, had become a casting agent for [[Associated British Picture Corporation]] and advised him to try out for the Dundee Repertory Company. Todd did so, performing in plays such as ''Claudia'', where he appeared with Catherine Grant-Bogle. Lennard arranged for a screen test and Associated British offered him a long-term contract in 1948. He was cast in the lead in ''[[For Them That Trespass]]'' (1949), directed by [[Alberto Cavalcanti]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47223206 |title=Richard Todd is newest find for British films. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=9 July 1949 |accessdate=25 July 2012 |page=38 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The film was a minor hit and Todd's career was launched.<ref>Nepean, E.

This led to his being cast in that role in the [[Warner Bros.]] [[The Hasty Heart|film adaptation of the play]], which was filmed in [[UK|Britain]] alongside [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Patricia Neal]].

He was lent out to a new company, Constellation Films, to appear in a thriller, ''[[The Interrupted Journey]]'' (1949). [[Alfred Hitchcock]] then used him in ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' (1950), opposite [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Jane Wyman]] \u2013 Hitchcock's first British film located in Britain since 1939.\n\nAssociated British put him in a drama, ''[[Portrait of Clare]]'' (1950), which did not perform particularly well at the box office. Neither did ''[[Flesh and Blood (1951 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'' (1951), for London Films, in which Todd had a dual role. Director [[King Vidor]] offered Todd a lead in a Hollywood movie,  ''[[Lightning Strikes Twice (1951 film)|Lightning Strikes Twice]]'' (1951). Far more popular was ''[[The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men]]'' (1952), in which Todd played the title role for the Disney Corporation.\n\nAssociated British put him in another thriller, ''[[24 Hours of a Woman's Life]]'' (1952), with [[Merle Oberon]]. The Rank Organisation borrowed him for a thriller, ''[[Venetian Bird]]'' (1952), directed by [[Ralph Thomas]].\n\nDisney reunited the ''Robin Hood'' team in ''[[The Sword and the Rose]]'' (1953), with Todd as [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk]]. It was not as popular as ''Robin Hood'' in the US but performed well in Europe. The same went for Disney's, ''[[Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue]]'' (1953), in which Todd played the title role. Disney pulled back on making costume films as a result.<ref>Disney Reports Income Gain Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 4 June 1954: A7.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, he appeared in a [[BBC Television]] adaptation of the novel ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', as Heathcliff. [[Nigel Kneale]], responsible for the adaptation, said the production came about purely because Todd had turned up at the BBC and told them that he would like to play Heathcliff for them. Kneale had to write the script in only a week as the broadcast was rushed into production.<ref name=\"kneale\">{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Andy |title=Into the Unknown: The Fantastic Life of Nigel Kneale|type=paperback|year=2006|location=London|publisher=[[Headpress]]|isbn=978-1-900486-50-7|page=34}}</ref>\n\nTodd's career received a boost when [[20th Century-Fox]] signed him to a non-exclusive contract and cast him as the United States Senate Chaplain [[Peter Marshall (preacher)|Peter Marshall]] in the [[A Man Called Peter|film version]] of [[Catherine Marshall]]'s best selling biography, ''[[Peter Marshall (preacher)|A Man Called Peter]]'' (1955), which was a popular success.\n\nEven more popular was ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1955) in which Todd played [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Guy Gibson]]. This was the most successful film at the British box office in 1955<ref>\"'The Dam Busters'.\" ''Times'' [London, England], 29 December 1955, p. 12, via ''The Times Digital Archive''. Retrieved: 11 July 2012.</ref>  and which would become the defining role of Todd's movie career.\n\n20th Century Fox offered Todd another historical picture, ''[[The Virgin Queen (1955 film)|The Virgin Queen]]'' (1955), playing [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] opposite [[Bette Davis]]' [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. It did not do as well as ''Peter''.\n\nIn France he played [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Axel Fersen]] opposite [[Mich\u00e8le Morgan]] in ''[[Marie Antoinette Queen of France]]'' (1956), which was popular in France but not widely seen elsewhere. Fox cast him in a war film, ''[[D-Day the Sixth of June]]'' (1956), opposite Robert Taylor, which was a mild success.\n\n''[[Yangtse Incident: The Story of H.M.S. Amethyst]]'' (1957) was an attempt to repeat the success of ''The Dam Busters'', with the same director (Michael Anderson) and Todd playing another real life hero. It was popular in Britain but not on the scale of ''The Dam Busters''. He was [[Jean de Dunois|Dunois, Bastard of Orl\u00e9ans]] in ''[[Saint Joan (1957 film)|Saint Joan]]'' (1957), directed by [[Otto Preminger]].\n\n''[[Chase a Crooked Shadow]]'' (1958) was a thriller with director Anderson for Associated British. ''[[Intent to Kill]]'' (1958) was another thriller, this time for Fox, with [[Betsy Drake]]. He returned to war films with ''[[Danger Within]]'' (1958), a POW story. Then there were more thrillers, with ''[[Never Let Go]]'' (1960), directed by [[John Guillermin]] and co-starring [[Peter Sellers]] in a rare dramatic role.\n\nFew of these films had been overly popular but Todd was still the top billed star of ''[[The Long and the Short and the Tall (film)|The Long and the Short and the Tall]]'' (1961), with Laurence Harvey and Richard Harris. He tried comedy with ''[[Don't Bother to Knock (1961 film)|Don't Bother to Knock]]'' (1961), then made an adventure film in South Africa, ''[[The Hellions (film)|The Hellions]]'' (1961).\n\nTodd's cinema career rapidly declined in the 1960s as the [[counter-culture]] movement in the Arts became fashionable in England, with [[British New Wave|social-realist]] dramas commercially replacing the more middle-class orientated dramatic productions that Todd's performance character-type had previously excelled in.\n\n''[[The Boys (1962 British film)|The Boys]]'' (1962) was a courtroom drama film in which Todd played the lead prosecuting barrister. He had a good part among the many stars in ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), playing Major John Howard during the paratroop action before D-Day in which he himself had taken part in 1944 (another actor portrayed Todd); this was his biggest hit for some time. He appeared in ''[[The Very Edge]]'' (1963), a thriller, then he played Harry Sanders in two films for [[Harry Alan Towers]]: ''[[Death Drums Along the River]]'' (1965) and ''[[Coast of Skeletons]]'' (1965). He also had a small role in Anderson's ''[[Operation Crossbow (film)|Operation Crossbow]]'' (1965).\n\nIn 1964 he was a member of the jury at the [[14th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale 1964\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1964/04_jury_1964/04_Jury_1964.html |title=Berlinale 1964: Juries |accessdate=16 February 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nHe had a supporting part in ''[[The Battle of the Villa Fiorita]]'' (1965) and the lead in ''[[The Love-Ins]]'' (1968).\n\nIn the 1970s, he gained new fans when he appeared as the reader for Radio Four's ''Morning Story''. In the 1980s his distinctive voice was heard as narrator of ''Wings Over the World'', a thirteen-part documentary series about the history of aviation shown on Arts & Entertainment television. He appeared before the camera in the episode about the [[Lancaster bomber]]. Todd continued to act on television, including roles in ''[[Virtual Murder (TV series)|Virtual Murder]]''; ''[[Silent Witness]]'' and in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[Kinda (Doctor Who)|\"Kinda\"]]'' in 1982. In 1989 he appeared in the first episode of the sixth season of the television [[whodunit]] ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' in which he played Colonel Alex Schofield in the episode entitled [[List of Murder, She Wrote episodes#Season 6 (1989\u201390)|\"Appointment in Athens\"]].\n\nHe formed Triumph Theatre Productions with [[Duncan Weldon (producer)|Duncan C. Weldon]] and Paul Elliott in the late 1960s. This company produced more than 100 plays, musicals and pantomimes all over the country; some of them starred Todd.\n\nHis acting career extended into his eighties, and he made several appearances in British shows such as [[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]] and ''[[The Royal]]''. He appeared in The Royal as Hugh Hurst, a retired solicitor, in the episode \"Kiss and Tell\" (2003); his last appearance in Heartbeat was as Major Harold Beecham in the 2007 episode [[Heartbeat (series 11\u201318)#Series 16 (2006\u20132007)|\"Seeds of Destruction\"]].\n\nRichard Todd was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1993.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?participantId=192516 TCM]</ref>\n\nHe was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on two occasions: in March 1960 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]]; and in November 1988 when [[Michael Aspel]] surprised him on stage at the [[Theatre Royal Windsor]].\n\n===Unmade projects===\nTodd was the first choice of author [[Ian Fleming]] to play [[James Bond]] in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', but a scheduling conflict gave the role to [[Sean Connery]]. In the 1960s, Todd unsuccessfully attempted to produce a film of Ian Fleming's ''[[The Diamond Smugglers]]''<ref name=caught/> and a television series based on true accounts of the [[Queen's Messenger]]s.<ref name=caught/> He was also announced for a proposed film about [[William Shakespeare]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55851326 |title=Hope tops list for popularity. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=30 December 1950 |accessdate=10 July 2012 |page=5 Supplement: Sunday Magazine |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''British Film Character Actors'' (1982), Terence Pettigrew described Todd as \"an actor who made the most of what he had, which could be summed up as an inability to sit still while there was a horse to leap astride, a swollen river to swim or a tree to vanish into.\"\n\n==Personal life==\nBoth Todd's marriages ended in divorce. His first wife was actress Catherine Grant-Bogle, whom he met in Dundee Repertory and was married to from 1949 until 1970; they had a son Peter (1952\u20132005) and a daughter Fiona. In 1960 he had a son Jeremy with model Patricia Nelson. He was married to model Virginia Mailer from 1970 until 1992; they had two sons, Andrew and Seumas (1977\u20131997).<ref>[http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp Deaths England and Wales 1984\u20132006]</ref> \n\nIn retirement, Todd lived in the village of [[Little Ponton]] and later in [[Little Humby]], 8 miles from [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]].\n\nTwo of Todd's five children died by suicide. In 1997, Seumas Palethorpe-Todd shot himself in the head at the family home in Lincolnshire; an inquest determined that the suicide might have been a depressive reaction to the drug he was taking for severe acne. On 21 September 2005 Peter killed himself with a shotgun in [[East Malling]], [[Kent]], following marital difficulties.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4770682.stm|title=Suicide of actor's depressed son|publisher=BBC | date=3 March 2006 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> His sons' suicides affected Todd profoundly and he admitted to visiting their adjoining graves regularly.

He narrated a television documentary about the Squadron, and contributed forewords to several books on the subject, including: \"The Dam Buster Story\" (2003); \"Filming the Dam Busters\" (2005); and \"Bouncing-Bomb Man: The Science of Sir Barnes Wallis\" (2009).{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Death==\nTodd died at his home near [[Grantham]] in [[Lincolnshire]] on 3 December 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8394812.stm|work=BBC News|title=Dambusters star Richard Todd dies aged 90|accessdate=4 December 2009 | date=4 December 2009}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/05/movies/05todd.html Richard Todd, Dashing Actor, Dies at 90]</ref> His body was buried between his two sons Seumas and Peter at St. Guthlac's Church in [[Little Ponton]], in the county of [[Lincolnshire]].

''Comfort'' was positioned in proximity to [[Kuwait]], just off the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]] near [[Khafji]]. On 12 March 1991, ''Comfort'' was under way on her return trip home. She arrived in Baltimore on 15 April 1991. While deployed, ''Comfort'' traveled more than {{convert|30000|nmi|mi km|lk=in}} and consumed almost {{convert|3|e6U.S.gal|impgal L}} of fuel. More than 8,000 outpatients were seen, and 700 inpatients were admitted including four sailors injured in a high-pressure steam leak on {{USS|Iwo Jima|LPH-2|6}}. 337 surgical procedures were performed. Other notable benchmarks include: more than 2,100 safe helicopter activities; 7,000 prescriptions filled; 17,000 laboratory tests completed; 1,600 eyeglasses made; 800,000 meals served and 1,340 radiographic studies, including 141 [[CT scan]]s.\n{{-}}\n\n===Operation Sea Signal (1994)===\n{{Main|Operation Sea Signal}}\n''Comfort'' was ordered to activation to serve as migrant processing center for [[Haiti]]an migrants in 1994. During this mission, ''Comfort'' served as the first afloat migrant processing center. She set out for the Caribbean with a crew of 928 military and civilian personnel from various federal government and international agencies. On 16 June 1994 the first Haitian migrants were taken aboard. Over the months deployed, the population onboard swelled to 1,100. Shortly after, ''Comfort'' was ordered to discontinue processing and sailed for [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]], Cuba to drop off its remaining 400 migrants.\n{{-}}\n\n===Operation Uphold Democracy (1994)===\n{{Main|Operation Uphold Democracy}}\nOn 2 September 1994, ''Comfort'' was again directed to activate for an unprecedented second deployment.{{clarify|reason=no other hospital ship had been deployed twice?|date=April 2019}} ''Comfort'' was tasked to provide a 250-bed medically intensive patient capability for the 35,000 [[Cubans|Cuban]] and [[Haiti]]an migrants supported by Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ''Comfort'' departed Naval Base Norfolk, Virginia, with a specially configured crew of 566 personnel. Following the diplomatic agreement reached between the United States and [[Haiti]], ''Comfort'' took up a position off [[Port-au-Prince]] ready to receive casualties that might result from the transfer of U.S. and allied forces ashore. From 16 September through 2 October 1994, ''Comfort'' personnel provided both medical and surgical support to U.S. and allied forces ashore and afloat, emergency humanitarian care to injured Haitian citizens, and participated in various aspects of the Civil Affairs Program in an effort to aid the rebuilding effort of the local healthcare system.

She set out for the Caribbean with a crew of 928 military and civilian personnel from various federal government and international agencies. On 16 June 1994 the first Haitian migrants were taken aboard. Over the months deployed, the population onboard swelled to 1,100.

''Comfort'' departed Naval Base Norfolk, Virginia, with a specially configured crew of 566 personnel. Following the diplomatic agreement reached between the United States and [[Haiti]], ''Comfort'' took up a position off [[Port-au-Prince]] ready to receive casualties that might result from the transfer of U.S. and allied forces ashore. From 16 September through 2 October 1994, ''Comfort'' personnel provided both medical and surgical support to U.S. and allied forces ashore and afloat, emergency humanitarian care to injured Haitian citizens, and participated in various aspects of the Civil Affairs Program in an effort to aid the rebuilding effort of the local healthcare system.

The missions objective was to offer valuable training to U.S. military personnel while promoting U.S. goodwill in the region. In all, the civilian and military medical team treated more than 98,000 patients, provided 386,000 patient encounters and performed 1,100 surgeries.\nThe embarked medical crew was made up of more than 500 military and [[non-governmental organization]] (Project Hope and Operation Smile) doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals. Their primary focus was to support medical humanitarian assistance efforts ashore. A secondary mission was outpatient shipboard health service support.\nAlso supporting ''Comfort{{'}}s'' medical mission was a [[Seabee (US Navy)|SEABEE]] detachment from the East Coast-based Mobile Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit 202, which performed civic action repair and minor construction projects in the host countries. Also on the deployment was the U.S. Navy Showband from [[Norfolk, Virginia]], which performed in each port.\n''USNS Comfort'' was operated and navigated by a crew of 68 civil service mariners (CIVMARS) from the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC).\nThis mission incorporated various non-government organizations and government agencies, such as Operation Smile, Project Hope, [[LDS Humanitarian Services]], the Atlanta Rotary Club, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army, U.S. Health and Human Services and the Canadian Armed Forces.\nPatient encounters included a single patient receiving multiple treatments, students in training sessions, and even veterinary care services.\nDentists and staff treated 25,000 patients, extracting 300 teeth, and performing 4,000 fillings, 7,000 sealings, and 20,000 fluoride applications.

She provided life saving care,  including dialysis as well as fixed dialysis shunts and placed portacath shunts as the only working interventional radiology capability.

[[Hasbro]]:\n| 2006\u2013Present\n|}\n'''Marvel Legends''' is an [[action figure]] line based on the characters of [[Marvel Comics]], initially produced by [[Toy Biz]], then by [[Hasbro]]. This line is in the {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} scale, with spin-off lines in the {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}}, {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}}, and {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} scale.\n\nThe line initially began as a spin-off of the [[Spider-Man Classics]] line, which were also produced by Toy Biz. At its inception in 2002, the Marvel Legends line copied the clam-shell packaging and the included comic book that had shipped with the Spider-Man Classics line. Beginning January 1, 2007, Hasbro became the new license holder to the rights to produce toys and games based upon the Marvel Universe. The new Hasbro packaging did not include a comic book and the new molds eliminated finger joints, which were a mainstay during the Toy Biz era, but the company did continue with the theme of Build-A-Figure pieces. During the late 2000s, production on the Marvel Legends line slowed down to the point where it was rumored that it may be cancelled, but Hasbro revealed (at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]) that due to fan requests and the upcoming movies based on Marvel characters, the line would be making a comeback in 2012, and in January 2012, Marvel Legends returned to store shelves.\n\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic Con, Hasbro announced that Marvel Legends would be given a new start as the ''Marvel Legends Infinite Series'' starting with the [[Mandroid]] series. Initially, the Marvel Legends line has used the \"chase\" concept to introduce figures based on less popular or recognisable characters. These got their nickname by being shipped in fewer quantities than the rest of the figures, thus causing collectors to ''chase'' after them. Eventually, rather than entirely new figures, the chase concept evolved into variants (such as an alternate head or a different colour scheme) of a figure released in that same series.

[[Toy Biz]]:\n| 2002\u20132006\n|-\n! [[Hasbro]]:\n| 2006\u2013Present\n|}\n'''Marvel Legends''' is an [[action figure]] line based on the characters of [[Marvel Comics]], initially produced by [[Toy Biz]], then by [[Hasbro]]. This line is in the {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} scale, with spin-off lines in the {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}}, {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}}, and {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} scale.\n\nThe line initially began as a spin-off of the [[Spider-Man Classics]] line, which were also produced by Toy Biz. At its inception in 2002, the Marvel Legends line copied the clam-shell packaging and the included comic book that had shipped with the Spider-Man Classics line. Beginning January 1, 2007, Hasbro became the new license holder to the rights to produce toys and games based upon the Marvel Universe. The new Hasbro packaging did not include a comic book and the new molds eliminated finger joints, which were a mainstay during the Toy Biz era, but the company did continue with the theme of Build-A-Figure pieces. During the late 2000s, production on the Marvel Legends line slowed down to the point where it was rumored that it may be cancelled, but Hasbro revealed (at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]) that due to fan requests and the upcoming movies based on Marvel characters, the line would be making a comeback in 2012, and in January 2012, Marvel Legends returned to store shelves.\n\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic Con, Hasbro announced that Marvel Legends would be given a new start as the ''Marvel Legends Infinite Series'' starting with the [[Mandroid]] series. Initially, the Marvel Legends line has used the \"chase\" concept to introduce figures based on less popular or recognisable characters. These got their nickname by being shipped in fewer quantities than the rest of the figures, thus causing collectors to ''chase'' after them. Eventually, rather than entirely new figures, the chase concept evolved into variants (such as an alternate head or a different colour scheme) of a figure released in that same series. These figures retained being sought-after by collectors. A Marvel Legends [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]] \"figure\" was included as a joke cut-out in the GLX-Mas Special (2005). It featured \"infinite\" points of articulation and three action phrases (to be said with one's own voice).\n\n==Toy Biz==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=5%|'''Series'''\n!width=5%|'''Release'''\n!width=15%|'''Figure'''\n!width=25%|'''Accessories'''\n!width=25%|'''Description'''\n!width=25%|'''Comic'''\n|-\n|rowspan=7|1\n|rowspan=7|May 2002\n|[[Captain America]]\n|destroyed building and American flag display\n|\n|Captain America (1968) #109\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Hulk]]\n|rowspan=2|destroyed wall stand\n|bendable fingers\n|rowspan=2|Incredible Hulk (1968) #314\n|-\n|straight fingers and white shirt variant\n|-\n|rowspan=3|[[Iron Man]]\n|rowspan=3|[[Stark Industries]] sign stand\n|Model 3 armor\n|rowspan=3|Iron Man (1968) #149\n|-\n|Model 2 (horned) gold\n|-\n|Stealth armor\n|-\n|[[Toad (comics)|Toad]]\n|swamp stand\n|frog permanently in hand, from the unreleased \"Evolution of X\" two-pack from ''[[X-Men (2000 film)]]''\n|Uncanny X-Men (1963) #4\n|-\n|rowspan=8|2\n|rowspan=8|September 2002\n|-\n|[[Doctor Doom]]\n|rowspan=2|castle tower stand\n|\n|rowspan=2|Fantastic Four (1961) #247\n|-\n|[[Doombot]]\n|removable mask\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Human Torch]]\n|rowspan=2|Flame stand from pre-Legends ''Marvel's Most Wanted'' [[Nate Grey|X-Man]] figure\n|''4'' on chest\n|rowspan=2|Fantastic Four (1961) #233\n|-\n|no \"4\"\n|-\n|[[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner\n|trident and water stand\n|\n|The Sub-Mariner (1968) #67\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Thing (comics)|Thing]]\n|Yancy Street wall display\n|\n|rowspan=2|Fantastic Four (1961) #263\n|-\n|Trenchcoat, sunglasses, Yancy Street wall display\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=6|3\n|rowspan=6|December 2002\n|[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]\n|church window stand\n|[[Daredevil (film)]] version\n|Daredevil (1964) #164\n|-\n|[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)]]\n|Motorcycle\n|\n|Ghost Rider (1973) #2\n|-\n|[[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]\n|disembodied Sentinel head base\n|\n|X-Men (1991) #2\n|-\n|[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]\n|stand\n|\n|Thor (1966) #39\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]\n|rowspan=2|[[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] guards stand\n|Masked<br />Retool of \"Evolution of X\" two-pack from ''[[X-Men (2000 film)]]''\n|rowspan=2|Uncanny X-Men (1963) #133\n|-\n|unmasked\n|-\n|rowspan=6|4\n|rowspan=6|June 2003\n|[[Beast (comics)|Beast]]\n|pull up bar base\n|\n|X-Men (1991) #3\n|-\n|[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]\n|2 swords, 2 sai, back scabbards and samurai stand\n|\n|Daredevil (1964) #176\n|-\n|[[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]\n|flaming cards, staff and Sentinel right hand stand\n|\n|X-Men (1991) #4\n|-\n|[[Hank Pym|Goliath (Pym)]], [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man (Lang)]], and [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]\n|\n|repaint of ''Avengers'' #1 (Non-Legends) Giant-Man, Ant-Man and Wasp mini-figures\n|The Avengers (1963) #28\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Punisher]]\n|rowspan=2|guns and War Zone stand\n|white belt\n|rowspan=2|Punisher War Zone (1992) #1\n|-\n|black belt\n|-\n|rowspan=7|5\n|rowspan=7|November 2003\n|[[Blade (comics)|Blade]]\n|sword, gun and motorcycle\n|[[Blade II]] version\n|originally ''Tomb of Dracula'' (1972) #45, then poster book of ''Blade II''\n|-\n|[[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]\n|disembodied Sentinel torso stand\n|\n|Uncanny X-Men (1963) #129\n|-\n|[[Mr. Fantastic]]\n|interchangeable arms and [[Fantasticar]] stand\n|\n|Fantastic Four (1961) #489\n|-\n|[[Nick Fury]]\n|gun and flaming jetpack stand\n|\n|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Although the contract was not at all for the purpose of jamming foreign radio stations broadcasting to China, it now appears that this is what the ALLISS [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s are being used for.\n\nIn 2003 Thales UK's design won the competition for the [[Royal Navy]] [[Royal Navy CVF programme|Future Carrier (CVF)]] and the company now participates in an alliance company with [[BAE Systems]] and the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].\n\nThales Navigation, a division that produced [[GPS]] units, was sold to private equity group Shah Capital Partners in 2006 for $170 million and renamed [[Magellan Navigation|Magellan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article-view/release/72710/thales-completes-sale-of-gps-navigation-business.html|title=Thales Finalizes the Sale of Its GPS Navigation Business to Shah Capital Partners|website=www.defense-aerospace.com|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/news/shah-capital-partners-completes-acquisition-of-thales-navigation-now-magellan/|title=Shah Capital Partners completes acquisition of Thales Navigation, now Magellan|last=|first=|date=|website=Geospatialworld|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Acquisitions ===\nIn 2006 Thales acquired [[Australian Defence Industries]], a major manufacturer of military equipment such as smokeless gunpowder and the [[Bushmaster IMV]].\n\nIn April 2006, Thales announced it would be acquiring [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]]'s space business (67% of [[Alcatel Alenia Space]] and 33% of [[Telespazio]]), and Alcatel's Rail Signalling Solutions division in a deal which also raised Alcatel's ownership of Thales to 21.66 percent.

Thales often worked with [[DCNS (company)|DCNS]] and designed the electronics used on French ships, and it is involved in the construction of both the [[Horizon class frigate|Horizon]] and [[FREMM multipurpose frigate|FREMM]] programs.

A son of [[Shapur III]] ({{reign|383|388}}), he succeeded  his brother [[Bahram IV]] ({{reign|388|399}}) after Bahram's assassination.\n\nYazdegerd I's largely-uneventful reign is seen in Sasanian history as a period of renewal. Although he was periodically known as \"the Sinner\" in native sources, Yazdegerd was more competent than his recent predecessors. He enjoyed cordial relations with the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and was entrusted with the guardianship of the Roman prince, [[Theodosius II|Theodosius]], by Theodosius' father [[Arcadius]]. Yazdegerd I is known for his friendly relations with the [[Persian Jews|Jews]] and [[Christianity in Iran|Christians]] of the [[Church of the East]], which he acknowledged in 410. Because of this, he was praised by Jews and Christians as the new [[Cyrus the Great]] ({{reign|550|530 BC}}, king of the Iranian [[Achaemenid Empire]] who liberated the Jews from captivity in [[Babylon]]).\n\nThe king's religious, peaceful policies were disliked by the nobility and [[Zoroastrian]] clergy, whose power and influence he strove to curb. This eventually backfired, and Yazdegerd I met his end at the hands of the nobility in the remote northeast. The nobles then sought to stop Yazdegerd's sons from the ascending the throne; his eldest son, [[Shapur IV]], was quickly killed after his accession and replaced with [[Khosrow (son of Bahram IV)|Khosrow]]. Another son, [[Bahram V]], hurried to the Sasanian capital of [[Ctesiphon]] with an [[Arabs|Arab]] army and pressured the nobility to acknowledge him as [[shah]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Yazdegerd is a combination of the [[Iranian languages#Old Iranian|Old Iranian]] ''yazad yazata'' (divine being) and ''-karta'' (made) \u2013 \"God-made\", comparable to the Iranian ''Bagkart'' and [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Theoktistos''.{{sfn|Shahbazi|2003}} It is known in other languages as Yazdekert ([[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]]); Yazd[e]gerd ([[New Persian]]); Yazdegerd, Izdegerd and Yazdeger ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]); Yazdkert ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]); Izdeger and Azger (in the [[Talmud]]); Yazdeijerd ([[Arabic]]), and Isdigerdes (Greek).{{sfn|Shahbazi|2003}}\n\n== {{anchor|Background and state of the empire}}Background ==\n[[Image:BahramIVOtherCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|alt=See caption|Coin of [[Bahram IV]] ({{reign|388|399}})]]\nYazdegerd I was the son of [[Shapur III]] ({{reign|383|388}}).

Although he was periodically known as \"the Sinner\" in native sources, Yazdegerd was more competent than his recent predecessors. He enjoyed cordial relations with the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and was entrusted with the guardianship of the Roman prince, [[Theodosius II|Theodosius]], by Theodosius' father [[Arcadius]]. Yazdegerd I is known for his friendly relations with the [[Persian Jews|Jews]] and [[Christianity in Iran|Christians]] of the [[Church of the East]], which he acknowledged in 410. Because of this, he was praised by Jews and Christians as the new [[Cyrus the Great]] ({{reign|550|530 BC}}, king of the Iranian [[Achaemenid Empire]] who liberated the Jews from captivity in [[Babylon]]).\n\nThe king's religious, peaceful policies were disliked by the nobility and [[Zoroastrian]] clergy, whose power and influence he strove to curb. This eventually backfired, and Yazdegerd I met his end at the hands of the nobility in the remote northeast. The nobles then sought to stop Yazdegerd's sons from the ascending the throne; his eldest son, [[Shapur IV]], was quickly killed after his accession and replaced with [[Khosrow (son of Bahram IV)|Khosrow]]. Another son, [[Bahram V]], hurried to the Sasanian capital of [[Ctesiphon]] with an [[Arabs|Arab]] army and pressured the nobility to acknowledge him as [[shah]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Yazdegerd is a combination of the [[Iranian languages#Old Iranian|Old Iranian]] ''yazad yazata'' (divine being) and ''-karta'' (made) \u2013 \"God-made\", comparable to the Iranian ''Bagkart'' and [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Theoktistos''.{{sfn|Shahbazi|2003}} It is known in other languages as Yazdekert ([[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]]); Yazd[e]gerd ([[New Persian]]); Yazdegerd, Izdegerd and Yazdeger ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]); Yazdkert ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]); Izdeger and Azger (in the [[Talmud]]); Yazdeijerd ([[Arabic]]), and Isdigerdes (Greek).{{sfn|Shahbazi|2003}}\n\n== {{anchor|Background and state of the empire}}Background ==\n[[Image:BahramIVOtherCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|alt=See caption|Coin of [[Bahram IV]] ({{reign|388|399}})]]\nYazdegerd I was the son of [[Shapur III]] ({{reign|383|388}}).
