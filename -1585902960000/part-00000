In each pair of canopies sits a rabbinic scholar who explains the Torah to one.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref> When one enters Paradise one is proffered by [[Michael (archangel)]] to God on the altar of the temple of the heavenly Jerusalem,<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj104.htm The Sacred Page: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref>  whereupon one is transfigured into an angel (the ugliest person becomes as beautiful and shining as \"the grains of a silver pomegranate upon which fall the rays of the sun\").<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref> The angels that guard Paradise's gate adorn one in seven clouds of glory, crown one with gems and pearls and gold, place eight [[myrtles]] in one's hand, and praise one for being righteous while leading one to a garden of eight hundred roses and myrtles that is watered by many rivers.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref> In the garden is one's canopy, its beauty according to one's merit, but each canopy has four rivers - milk, honey, wine, and [[balsam]]<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref> - flowing out from it, and has a golden vine and thirty shining pearls hanging from it.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref> Under each canopy is a table of gems and pearls attended to by sixty angels.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref>  The light of Paradise is the light of the righteous people therein.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref> Each day in Paradise one wakes up a child and goes to bed an elder to enjoy the pleasures of childhood, youth, adulthood, and old age.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref> In each corner of Paradise is a forest of 800,000 trees, the least among the trees greater than the best herbs and spices,<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref> attended to by 800,000 sweetly singing angels.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref> Paradise is divided into seven paradises, each one 120,000 miles long and wide.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref>  Depending on one's merit, one joins one of the paradises: the first is made of glass and cedar and is for converts to Judaism; the second is of silver and cedar and is for penitents; the third is of silver and gold, gems and pearls, and is for the patriarchs, Moses and Aaron, the Israelites that left Egypt and lived in the wilderness, and the kings of Israel; the fourth is of rubies and olive wood and is for the holy and steadfast in faith; the fifth is like the third, except a river flows through it and its bed was woven by Eve and angels, and it is for the Messiah and Elijah; and the sixth and seventh divisions are not described, except that they are respectively for those who died doing a pious act and for those who died from an illness in expiation for Israel's sins.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref> \n\nBeyond Paradise, according to Legends of the Jews, is the higher Gan Eden, where God is enthroned and explains the Torah to its inhabitants.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref> The higher Gan Eden contains three hundred ten worlds and is divided into seven compartments.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref> The compartments are not described, though it is implied that each compartment is greater than the previous one and is joined based on one's merit.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref>  The first compartment is for Jewish martyrs, the second for those who drowned, the third for \"Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai and his disciples,\" the fourth for those whom the cloud of glory carried off, the fifth for penitents, the sixth for youths who have never sinned; and the seventh for the poor who lived decently and studied the Torah.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref>\n\n==Zoroastrian eschatology==\nIn [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[eschatology]], the world to come is the ''[[frashokereti]]'', where the ''[[saoshyant]]'' will bring about a [[resurrection of the dead]] in the bodies they had before they died. This is followed by a [[last judgment]]. The ''[[yazata]]s'' [[Airyaman]] and [[Atar]] will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and the molten metal will then flow across the earth like a river. All humankind\u2014both the living and the resurrected dead\u2014will be required to wade through that river, but for the righteous (''[[ashavan]]'') it will seem to be a river of warm milk, while the wicked will be burned. The river will then flow down to [[hell]], where it will annihilate [[Angra Mainyu]] and the last vestiges of wickedness in the universe.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Otherworld]]\n* [[Possible world]]\n* [[Problem of evil]]\n* [[Technological singularity]] - A controversial concept in futurism often associated with the establishment of something similar to the World to Come by technological means\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Eschatology]]\n[[Category:Biblical phrases]]\n[[Category:World]]\n[[Category:Biblical cosmology]]\n", "name_user": "Nagy magy", "label": "safe", "comment": "notable mention which supports the Hindu's perspective on what the \"end times\" would be like when their coming Kaiki arrives", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_to_come"}

Important biologics include:\n\n* [[Whole blood]] and other blood components\n* [[organ transplantation|Organs]] and [[tissue transplant]]s\n* [[Stem cell therapy]]\n* [[Antibodies]] for [[passive immunization]] (e.g., to treat a [[virus]] infection)\n* [[Breast milk|Human breast milk]]\n* [[Fecal microbiota transplant|Fecal microbiota]]\n* [[Human fertilization|Human reproductive cells]]\n\nSome biologics that were previously extracted from animals, such as insulin, are now more commonly produced by [[recombinant DNA]].\n\n===Produced by recombinant DNA===\n{{see also|Biologics for immunosuppression}}\n\nAs indicated the term \"biologics\" can be used to refer to a wide range of biological products in medicine. However, in most cases, the term \"biologics\" is used more restrictively for a class of therapeutics (either approved or in development) that are produced by means of biological processes involving [[recombinant DNA]] technology. These medications are usually one of three types:\n# Substances that are (nearly) identical to the body's own key signalling proteins. Examples are the blood-production stimulating protein [[erythropoetin]], or the growth-stimulating hormone named (simply) \"[[growth hormone]]\" or biosynthetic human [[insulin]] and its analogues.\n# [[Monoclonal antibodies]]. These are similar to the antibodies that the human immune system uses to fight off bacteria and viruses, but they are \"custom-designed\" (using [[hybridoma]] technology or other methods) and can therefore be made specifically to counteract or block any given substance in the body, or to target any specific cell type; examples of such monoclonal antibodies for use in various diseases are given in the table below.\n# Receptor constructs ([[fusion protein]]s), usually based on a naturally occurring receptor linked to the [[immunoglobulin]] frame. In this case, the receptor provides the construct with detailed specificity, whereas the immunoglobulin-structure imparts stability and other useful features in terms of [[pharmacology]]. Some examples are listed in the table below.\n\nBiologics as a class of medications in this narrower sense have had a profound impact on many medical fields, primarily [[rheumatology]] and [[oncology]], but also [[cardiology]], [[dermatology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[neurology]], and others. In most of these disciplines, biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which no effective therapies were available, and others where previously existing therapies were clearly inadequate. However, the advent of biologic therapeutics has also raised complex regulatory issues (see below), and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns, because the cost for biologic therapies has been dramatically higher than for conventional (pharmacological) medications. This factor has been particularly relevant since many biological medications are used for the treatment of [[chronic diseases]], such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of otherwise untreatable cancer during the remainder of life. The cost of treatment with a typical monoclonal antibody therapy for relatively common indications is generally in the range of \u20ac7,000\u201314,000 per patient per year.\n\nOlder patients who receive biologic therapy for diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], or [[ankylosing spondylitis]] are at increased risk for life-threatening infection, adverse cardiovascular events, and [[malignancy]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr LD | title = The use of biologic agents in the geriatric population | journal = J Musculoskel Med | volume = 27 | pages = 175\u2013180 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/arthritis/content/article/1145622/1562177}}</ref>\n\nThe first such substance approved for therapeutic use was biosynthetic \"human\" [[insulin]] made via [[recombinant DNA]]. Sometimes referred to as rHI, under the [[trade name]] [[Humulin]], was developed by [[Genentech]], but licensed to [[Eli Lilly and Company]], who manufactured and marketed it starting in 1982.\n\nMajor kinds of biopharmaceuticals include:\n*Blood factors ([[Factor VIII]] and [[Factor IX]])\n*Thrombolytic agents ([[tissue plasminogen activator]])\n*[[Hormones]] ([[insulin]], glucagon, growth hormone, gonadotrophins)\n*Haematopoietic growth factors ([[Erythropoietin]], [[colony stimulating factors]])\n*[[Interferons]] (Interferons-\u03b1, -\u03b2, -\u03b3)\n*[[Interleukin]]-based products (Interleukin-2)\n*[[Vaccines]] ([[Hepatitis B]] surface [[antigen]])\n*[[Monoclonal antibodies]] (Various)\n*Additional products ([[tumour necrosis factor]], therapeutic enzymes)\n\nResearch and development investment in new medicines by the biopharmaceutical industry stood at $65.2 billion in 2008.<ref>{{cite web \n| author=BriskFox Financial\n| title=Biopharmaceutical sector sees rising R&D despite credit crunch, finds analysis  \n| url=http://www.briskfox.com/open/years/2009_q1/do_v_c44751.php\n| access-date=2009-03-11 }}</ref> A few examples of biologics made with [[recombinant DNA]] technology include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Important biologics include:\n\n* [[Whole blood]] and other blood components\n* [[organ transplantation|Organs]] and [[tissue transplant]]s\n* [[Stem cell therapy]]\n* [[Antibodies]] for [[passive immunization]] (e.g., to treat a [[virus]] infection)\n* [[Breast milk|Human breast milk]]\n* [[Fecal microbiota transplant|Fecal microbiota]]\n* [[Human fertilization|Human reproductive cells]]\n\nSome biologics that were previously extracted from animals, such as insulin, are now more commonly produced by [[recombinant DNA]].\n\n===Produced by recombinant DNA===\n{{see also|Biologics for immunosuppression}}\n\nAs indicated the term \"biologics\" can be used to refer to a wide range of biological products in medicine. However, in most cases, the term \"biologics\" is used more restrictively for a class of therapeutics (either approved or in development) that are produced by means of biological processes involving [[recombinant DNA]] technology. These medications are usually one of three types:\n# Substances that are (nearly) identical to the body's own key signalling proteins. Examples are the blood-production stimulating protein [[erythropoetin]], or the growth-stimulating hormone named (simply) \"[[growth hormone]]\" or biosynthetic human [[insulin]] and its analogues.\n# [[Monoclonal antibodies]]. These are similar to the antibodies that the human immune system uses to fight off bacteria and viruses, but they are \"custom-designed\" (using [[hybridoma]] technology or other methods) and can therefore be made specifically to counteract or block any given substance in the body, or to target any specific cell type; examples of such monoclonal antibodies for use in various diseases are given in the table below.\n# Receptor constructs ([[fusion protein]]s), usually based on a naturally occurring receptor linked to the [[immunoglobulin]] frame. In this case, the receptor provides the construct with detailed specificity, whereas the immunoglobulin-structure imparts stability and other useful features in terms of [[pharmacology]]. Some examples are listed in the table below.\n\nBiologics as a class of medications in this narrower sense have had a profound impact on many medical fields, primarily [[rheumatology]] and [[oncology]], but also [[cardiology]], [[dermatology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[neurology]], and others. In most of these disciplines, biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which no effective therapies were available, and others where previously existing therapies were clearly inadequate. However, the advent of biologic therapeutics has also raised complex regulatory issues (see below), and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns, because the cost for biologic therapies has been dramatically higher than for conventional (pharmacological) medications. This factor has been particularly relevant since many biological medications are used for the treatment of [[chronic diseases]], such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of otherwise untreatable cancer during the remainder of life. The cost of treatment with a typical monoclonal antibody therapy for relatively common indications is generally in the range of \u20ac7,000\u201314,000 per patient per year.\n\nOlder patients who receive biologic therapy for diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], or [[ankylosing spondylitis]] are at increased risk for life-threatening infection, adverse cardiovascular events, and [[malignancy]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr LD | title = The use of biologic agents in the geriatric population | journal = J Musculoskel Med | volume = 27 | pages = 175\u2013180 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/arthritis/content/article/1145622/1562177}}</ref>\n\nThe first such substance approved for therapeutic use was biosynthetic \"human\" [[insulin]] made via [[recombinant DNA]].

Along with [[inhalation]], [[ingestion]] and [[Injection (medicine)|injection]], [[dermis|dermal]] absorption is a route of exposure for toxic substances and [[route of administration]] for [[medication]]. Absorption of substances through the skin depends on a number of factors, the most important of which are [[concentration]], duration of contact, [[solubility]] of medication, and physical condition of the skin and part of the body exposed.\n\nSkin (percutaneous, dermal) absorption is the transport of chemicals from the outer surface of the skin both into the skin and into circulation.  Skin absorption relates to the degree of exposure to and possible effect of a substance which may enter the body through the skin.  Human skin comes into contact with many agents intentionally and unintentionally.

Tissue samples may also be evaluated for the presence of the test chemical.<ref name=WHO>World Health Organization, Enivironmental Health Criteria 235, Dermal Absorption, 2006.</ref>  In some test protocols many animals may be tested and necropsies may occur at set intervals after exposure.

[[Sarin]], a nerve gas, can be absorbed through intact skin and be lethal at low concentrations.  Thus if one needs to assess the risk of Sarin exposure one must take skin absorption and other routes into account but one cannot ethically test Sarin on human subjects; thus ways of modeling the risk from skin exposure of the agent have been found. \n  \nModels are used in some instances to predict the amount of exposure or absorption and to assess public health hazards. \nIn order to assess the risk of a chemical causing a health issue one must assess the chemical and the exposure.  \nExposure modeling depends on several factors and assumptions.\n#   The surface area of skin exposed. The surface area of an adult is about 20,900 cm2 and the surface area of a child of 6 years is about 9,000 cm2.  These figures and figures for other body parts or portions can be found in the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Exposures Handbook 1996<ref name=EPA>EPA Exposure Handbook 1996</ref> or estimated using other databases.<ref>Yu, CY et al.  Human body surface area database and estimation formula.  Burns. 2010 Aug;36(5):616-29..</ref>\n#   The duration of exposure (in hours, minutes, etc.).\n#   The concentration of the chemical. \n#   The permeability coefficient of the chemical (how easy it is for the chemical to get through the skin).  This may be estimated using an [[octanol-water partitioning coefficient]] (a measurement of the uptake from aqueous solution into powdered stratum corneum).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wester | display-authors = etal   | year = 1987 | title = In vivo and vitro binding to powdered human stratum corneum as methods to evaluate skin absorption of environmental chemical contaminiants from ground and surface water | url = | journal = J Toxicol Environ Health | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 367\u2013374 | doi=10.1080/15287398709531025}}</ref>\n#   The weight of the person. Standard weight of an adult 71.8&nbsp;kg, a 6-year-old child 22&nbsp;kg and female of child-bearing age 60&nbsp;kg are generally used.<ref name=EPA/>\n#   The nature of the exposure. (Is it a cream applied to the whole body or just a small area? Or is it a bath in a dilute solution?)\n\n==== Skin contact with dry chemical ====\n\n:To calculate the dose of chemical a person is exposed to one must multiply the surface area of the skin exposed by the concentration of the chemical in the substance that comes into contact with the skin. Then multiply by the time in contact, by the permeability coefficients, and any unit conversion factors needed, then divide by the weight of the person. \n:A simple mathematical formula to estimate the dose for a single exposure is:\n:: '''concentration of chemical x surface area exposed x permeability coefficient / body weight.''' \n:Models for this can be found in the EPA Standard Operating Procedures for Residential Exposure Assessment.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/science/USEPA-OPP-HED_Residential%20SOPs_Oct2012.pdf EPA 2012 Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) for Residential Exposure Assessment]</ref>  These models establish guidelines for estimating pesticide exposure so that one can judge the risk and take appropriate actions if the risk is judged to be too great given the exposure.\n\n==== Skin contact with chemical in solution (water, etc.) ====\n\n:This can be modeled similarly to the dry chemical but one has to take into account the amount of solution the skin comes into contact with.  Three scenarios for exposure to chemicals in a solution have been proposed and modeled. \n:a.  A person could be exposed partially to a solution for a period of time.  For instance if one stood in contaminated flood water for a period of time, or one worked in a situation where the hands and lower arms were immersed in a solution for a period of time. This type of scenario depends on the skin area exposed and the duration of the exposure as well as the concentration of the chemical in the solution.  One may have to adjust the absorption coefficients for the different area of the body as the feet are more calloused on the bottom and will allow less chemical through than the lower leg. The rate of absorption of chemicals follows the following general scheme from fastest to slowest:  Scrotal > Forehead > Armpit \u2265 Scalp > Back = Abdomen > Palm = under the surface of the foot.<ref name= Baynes/> The dermal absorption of a dilute solution by partial leg or arm exposure has been modeled by Scharf.<ref name=Scharf/>  The EPA also has guidance on calculating the dermally absorbed doses of chemicals from contaminated water.<ref>US Enivironmental Protection Agency.  Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund. Volume I: Human Health Evaluation Manual (Part E, Supplemental Guidance for Dermal Risk Assessment)-Final.  Washington, DC: US EPA, Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation, EPA/540/R/99/005, OSWER 9285.7-02EP, July 2004.</ref>\n:Mathematical formula: \n::'''''Dermally absorbed dose rate  = concentration in water x surface area exposed x exposure time x permeability coefficient x [[conversion factors]]'''''.\n:b.  The second scenario is total body immersion, such as swimming in a pool or lake.  Exposure in swimming pools is only partially dermal and a SWIMODEL has been proposed.<ref>Dang, 1996 EPA SOP Estimating post application dermally absorbed dose from chemicals in Swimming pools</ref> This model takes into account not only the skin exposure but also considers ocular, ingestion, inhalation, and [[mucous membrane]] exposure that may occur due to being totally immersed.  A second model dealing primarily with skin absorption was created by Scharf to assess the risk of overspray of pesticide from aerial spraying on swimming pools.<ref name=Scharf/>  These models use whole body surface area rather than the surface area of specific parts for the mathematical input.  \n:c.  The third scenario is splash, or droplet exposure.  This model takes into account that not all water carrying a chemical that comes into contact with skin stays on the skin long enough to allow absorption.  Only that portion of a chemical in the solution that ''stays'' in contact with the skin is available for absorption. This may be modeled using water adherence factors as postulated by Gujral 2011.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gujral | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Proctor | first2 = D. M. | last3 = Su | first3 = S.

Measurements in rats, rabbits or pigs may or may not reflect human absorption.<ref name=Rozman/>  Finding the rate at which agents penetrate the skin is important for assessing the risk from exposures.\n\n=== Direct measurement ===\n\n=== In vivo ===\n\nA chemical may be directly applied to the skin followed by blood and urine measurements, at set time points after the application, to assess the amount of chemical that entered the body.  The concentration in the blood or urine at particular time points can be graphed to show an area under the curve and the extent and duration of absorption and distribution to provide a measure of systemic absorption.  This can be done in animals or humans with a dry chemical powder or a chemical in solution.<ref name=Scharf>{{cite journal | last1 = Scharf | first1 = JE | display-authors = etal   | year = 2008 | title = Dermal absorption of a dilute aqueous solution of malathion | url = | journal = J.

An area of skin is shaved before the chemical is applied.  Often the area of chemical application is covered to prevent ingestion or rubbing off of the test material.  Samples of blood and urine are taken at specific time intervals following application (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 10, and 24 hours) and in some protocols at the chosen end time the animal maybe necropsied. Tissue samples may also be evaluated for the presence of the test chemical.<ref name=WHO>World Health Organization, Enivironmental Health Criteria 235, Dermal Absorption, 2006.</ref>  In some test protocols many animals may be tested and necropsies may occur at set intervals after exposure. Biomonitoring, such as taking urine samples at intervals, from workers exposed to chemicals may provide some information but it is difficult to distinguish dermal from inhalation exposure using this method.\n\n=== Ex vivo ===\n\nThe permeability properties of the stratum corneum are, for the most part, unchanged after its removal from the body.<ref name= WHO/>  Skin that has been removed carefully from animals may also be used to see the extent of local penetration by putting it in a chamber and applying the chemical on one side and then measuring the amount of chemical that gets into a fluid on the other side.<ref name=Rice/>   One example of this ex vivo technique is the isolated perfused porcine flap.<ref name=Baynes/>  This method was first described in 1986 as a humane alternative to in vivo animal testing.<ref>Riviere JE et al.

Human skin is preferred but due to ethical and other considerations is not always available.  Human skin often may come from autopsies or plastic surgeries.<ref>Dressler WE (1999) Hair dye absorption. In: Bronaugh RL & Maibach HI eds.

The bottom chamber contains fluid from which samples are taken at regular intervals for analysis to determine the amount of active cells that has permeated the membrane at set time points.\n\nBronaugh cells are similar to Franz cells but use a flow-through system beneath the membrane layer and samples of the liquid below are taken continuously rather than at set time points.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bronaugh | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Stewart | first2 = R.F. | year = 1985 | title = Methods for percutaneous absorption studies.

[[Sarin]], a nerve gas, can be absorbed through intact skin and be lethal at low concentrations.  Thus if one needs to assess the risk of Sarin exposure one must take skin absorption and other routes into account but one cannot ethically test Sarin on human subjects; thus ways of modeling the risk from skin exposure of the agent have been found. \n  \nModels are used in some instances to predict the amount of exposure or absorption and to assess public health hazards. \nIn order to assess the risk of a chemical causing a health issue one must assess the chemical and the exposure.  \nExposure modeling depends on several factors and assumptions.\n#   The surface area of skin exposed. The surface area of an adult is about 20,900 cm2 and the surface area of a child of 6 years is about 9,000 cm2.  These figures and figures for other body parts or portions can be found in the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Exposures Handbook 1996<ref name=EPA>EPA Exposure Handbook 1996</ref> or estimated using other databases.<ref>Yu, CY et al.  Human body surface area database and estimation formula.  Burns. 2010 Aug;36(5):616-29..</ref>\n#   The duration of exposure (in hours, minutes, etc.).\n#   The concentration of the chemical. \n#   The permeability coefficient of the chemical (how easy it is for the chemical to get through the skin).  This may be estimated using an [[octanol-water partitioning coefficient]] (a measurement of the uptake from aqueous solution into powdered stratum corneum).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wester | display-authors = etal   | year = 1987 | title = In vivo and vitro binding to powdered human stratum corneum as methods to evaluate skin absorption of environmental chemical contaminiants from ground and surface water | url = | journal = J Toxicol Environ Health | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 367\u2013374 | doi=10.1080/15287398709531025}}</ref>\n#   The weight of the person. Standard weight of an adult 71.8&nbsp;kg, a 6-year-old child 22&nbsp;kg and female of child-bearing age 60&nbsp;kg are generally used.<ref name=EPA/>\n#   The nature of the exposure. (Is it a cream applied to the whole body or just a small area? Or is it a bath in a dilute solution?)\n\n==== Skin contact with dry chemical ====\n\n:To calculate the dose of chemical a person is exposed to one must multiply the surface area of the skin exposed by the concentration of the chemical in the substance that comes into contact with the skin. Then multiply by the time in contact, by the permeability coefficients, and any unit conversion factors needed, then divide by the weight of the person. \n:A simple mathematical formula to estimate the dose for a single exposure is:\n:: '''concentration of chemical x surface area exposed x permeability coefficient / body weight.''' \n:Models for this can be found in the EPA Standard Operating Procedures for Residential Exposure Assessment.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/science/USEPA-OPP-HED_Residential%20SOPs_Oct2012.pdf EPA 2012 Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) for Residential Exposure Assessment]</ref>  These models establish guidelines for estimating pesticide exposure so that one can judge the risk and take appropriate actions if the risk is judged to be too great given the exposure.\n\n==== Skin contact with chemical in solution (water, etc.) ====\n\n:This can be modeled similarly to the dry chemical but one has to take into account the amount of solution the skin comes into contact with.  Three scenarios for exposure to chemicals in a solution have been proposed and modeled. \n:a.  A person could be exposed partially to a solution for a period of time.  For instance if one stood in contaminated flood water for a period of time, or one worked in a situation where the hands and lower arms were immersed in a solution for a period of time. This type of scenario depends on the skin area exposed and the duration of the exposure as well as the concentration of the chemical in the solution.  One may have to adjust the absorption coefficients for the different area of the body as the feet are more calloused on the bottom and will allow less chemical through than the lower leg. The rate of absorption of chemicals follows the following general scheme from fastest to slowest:  Scrotal > Forehead > Armpit \u2265 Scalp > Back = Abdomen > Palm = under the surface of the foot.<ref name= Baynes/> The dermal absorption of a dilute solution by partial leg or arm exposure has been modeled by Scharf.<ref name=Scharf/>  The EPA also has guidance on calculating the dermally absorbed doses of chemicals from contaminated water.<ref>US Enivironmental Protection Agency.  Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund. Volume I: Human Health Evaluation Manual (Part E, Supplemental Guidance for Dermal Risk Assessment)-Final.  Washington, DC: US EPA, Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation, EPA/540/R/99/005, OSWER 9285.7-02EP, July 2004.</ref>\n:Mathematical formula: \n::'''''Dermally absorbed dose rate  = concentration in water x surface area exposed x exposure time x permeability coefficient x [[conversion factors]]'''''.\n:b.  The second scenario is total body immersion, such as swimming in a pool or lake.  Exposure in swimming pools is only partially dermal and a SWIMODEL has been proposed.<ref>Dang, 1996 EPA SOP Estimating post application dermally absorbed dose from chemicals in Swimming pools</ref> This model takes into account not only the skin exposure but also considers ocular, ingestion, inhalation, and [[mucous membrane]] exposure that may occur due to being totally immersed.  A second model dealing primarily with skin absorption was created by Scharf to assess the risk of overspray of pesticide from aerial spraying on swimming pools.<ref name=Scharf/>  These models use whole body surface area rather than the surface area of specific parts for the mathematical input.  \n:c.  The third scenario is splash, or droplet exposure.  This model takes into account that not all water carrying a chemical that comes into contact with skin stays on the skin long enough to allow absorption.  Only that portion of a chemical in the solution that ''stays'' in contact with the skin is available for absorption. This may be modeled using water adherence factors as postulated by Gujral 2011.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gujral | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Proctor | first2 = D. M. | last3 = Su | first3 = S.

More research is needed in this area.<ref>Rauma M. et al. Predicting the absorption of chemical vapours. Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2013 Feb;65(2):306-14. doi: 10.1016/j.addr.2012.03.012.
