Houses and flats built for public or social housing use are built by or for [[Municipality|local authorities]] and known as [[council house]]s, though since the 1980s the role of non-profit [[Housing association|housing associations]] became more important and subsequently the term \"social housing\" became more widely used, as technically council housing only refers to housing owned by a local authority, though the terms are largely used interchangeably. Before 1865, housing for the poor was provided solely by the private sector. Council houses were built on council estates, where other amenities, like schools and shops, were often also provided. From the 1950s, blocks of [[Apartment|flat]]s and three- or four-storey blocks of [[Apartment#Maisonette|maisonette]]s were widely built, alongside large developments of terraced housing, while the 1960s and (to some degree) the 1970s saw construction of many [[High-rise building|high-rise tower blocks]]. Flats and houses were also built in mixed estates.\n\nCouncil homes were built to supply uncrowded, well-built homes on [[Secure tenancy|secure tenancies]] at reasonable rents to primarily [[working-class]] people. Council housing in the mid-20th century included many large suburban \"council estates\", featuring terraced and semi-detached houses, where other amenities like schools and shops were often also provided.{{sfn|Hollow|2011}} By the late 1970s almost a third of UK households lived in social housing: some of these developments did not live up to the hopes of their supporters, and now suffer from [[urban blight]], while others became desirable locations.\n\nSince 1979, the role of council housing has changed. Housing stock has been sold under [[Right to Buy]] legislation, and new social housing has mainly been developed and managed by [[housing association]]s. A substantial part of the UK population still lives in council housing: in 2010, about 17% of UK households.<!-- later figures welcome--> Approximately 55% of the country's social housing stock is owned by local authorities \u2013 of which 15% is managed on a day-to-day basis by [[arms-length management organisation]]s, rather than the authority, and 45% by [[housing association]]s.<ref>{{citation |last=Cowan |first=David |year=2009 |title=Trust, Distrust and Betrayal |journal=[[Modern Law Review]] |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=157\u2013181 |issn= |doi= }}</ref> In Scotland, council estates are known as 'schemes'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/heritage/marking-100-years-of-scotland-s-council-houses-1-5006388|title=Marking 100 years of Scotland's council houses|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe history of public housing is the history of the housing of the poor. Even that statement is controversial, as before 1890 the state was not involved in housing policy. Public housing became needed to provide \"[[homes fit for heroes]]\" in 1919,{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc=Section 3 para. 1}}{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=60}} then to enable [[slum clearance]]. Standards were set to ensure high-quality homes. [[Aneurin Bevan]], a Labour politician, passionately believed that council houses should be provided for all, while the Conservative politician [[Harold Macmillan]] saw council housing \"as a stepping stone to home ownership\".{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=92}} The Labour government of [[Harold Wilson]] built houses and flats to the point where there was a surplus in the late 1960s. The Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] introduced Right to Buy in 1979, with the millionth council house being sold within seven years. In time the transfer of public housing stock to the private sector reached the point where councils had to rent back their own houses in order to house the homeless.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|pp=134,135}}\n\n===Before council housing===\nEven in the stable medieval model of landowner and peasant, where estate workers lived at the landowner's whim in a tied cottage, the aged and infirm needed provision from their former employer, the church or the state.{{sfn|de Pennington|2011}} <!-- could be more focussed -->\n\n====Almshouses====\n[[File:Dorset sherbone almshouses.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Almshouse]] at [[Sherborne]], [[Dorset]]]]\nThe documented history of social housing in Britain starts with [[almshouse]]s, which were established from the 10th century, to provide a place of residence for \"poor, old and distressed folk\". The first recorded almshouse was founded in [[York]] by King [[King \u00c6thelstan of England|\u00c6thelstan]]; the oldest still in existence is the [[Hospital of St Cross|Hospital of St. Cross]] in [[Winchester]], dating to {{circa}} 1133.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc=Section 7 para. 3}}\n\n====Workhouses====\nThe public [[workhouse]] was the final fallback solution for the destitute.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc=Section 7 para. 3}} Rural poverty had been greatly increased by the [[Inclosure Act]]s leaving many in need of assistance. This was divided into outside relief, or handouts to keep the family together, and inside relief, which meant submitting to the workhouse. The workhouse provided for two groups of people \u2013 the transient population roaming the country looking for seasonal work, and the long-term residents. The two were kept separate where possible. The long term residents included single elderly men incapable of further labour, and young women with their children\u2014often women who had been abandoned by their husbands, single mothers and servant-girls who had been dismissed from residential positions.{{sfn|de Pennington|2011}}\n\n====Migration to the city====\nThe pressure for decent housing was increased by overcrowding in the large cities during the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th century; many social commentators (such as [[Octavia Hill]]) reported on the squalor, sickness and immorality that arose. Some industrialists and independent organisations provided housing in [[Apartment building|tenement block]]s, while some [[philanthropist]] factory owners built entire villages for their workers, such as [[Saltaire]] (1853), [[Bournville]] (1879) and [[Port Sunlight]] (1888).{{sfn|UWE|2008|section=Before Council Housing}}\n\n===Council-built housing===\nThe [[City of London Corporation]] built [[tenement]]s in [[Farringdon Road]] in 1865,<ref>Tarn, J.

As a consequence, [[London County Council]] opened the [[Boundary Estate]] in 1900, a 'block dwelling estate' of tenements in [[Tower Hamlets]].{{sfn|Yelling|1995|p=167}} The Housing of the Working Classes Act 1900 extended these power to all local councils, which then began building tenements and houses. {{sfn|UWE|2008|loc=Section 2.}}{{sfn|Burnett|1986|p=184}}\n\n===Homes fit for heroes \u2013 interwar policy===\nIn 1912, [[Raymond Unwin]] published a pamphlet ''Nothing gained by Overcrowding''.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=153}} He worked on the influential Tudor Walters Report of 1918, which recommended housing in short terraces, spaced {{Convert|70|ft|m}} apart at a density of {{Convert|12|/acre|/ha}}. The [[World War I|First World War]] indirectly provided a new impetus, when the poor physical health and condition of many urban recruits to the [[British Army|army]] was noted with alarm. This led to a campaign under the slogan \"Homes fit for heroes\". In 1919, the Government first required councils to provide housing, built to the Tudor Walters standards, under the [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919]] (Addison Act), helping them to do so through the provision of subsidies.{{sfn|UK Parliament- Acts|2015}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newcastleareas.wordpress.com/2019/08/11/100-years-exhibition-the-1919-act/|title=100 years exhibition \u2013 the 1919 Act|last=Geography|first=Kay's|date=2019-08-11|website=Newcastle residential areas|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref> London County Council embraced these freedoms and planned eight 'cottage estates' in the peripheries of London: [[Becontree]], [[St Helier, London|St Helier]], [[Downham]] for example; seven further followed including [[Bellingham, London|Bellingham]]. Houses were built on green field land on the peripheries of the urban area. The war had caused house building costs to rise enormously: [[Ernest Simon, 1st Baron Simon of Wythenshawe|Sir Ernest Simon]] reported to the Manchester Housing Committee in 1910 that \"houses that had cost \u00a3250 to build pre war were then costing \u00a31,250, so the economic rent was 30/- a week but had to be let at 12/6d\".\n\nThe provision of local authority housing varied throughout the UK; in the period 1919-39 67% of the houses built in Scotland were in the public sector, compared to 26% in England.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scran.ac.uk/scotland/pdf/SP2_4Housing.pdf|title=URBAN HOUSING IN SCOTLAND 1840-1940|last=Knox|first=W.W.|website=SCRAN|publisher=Historic Environment Scotland|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===LCC cottage estates===\n{{main|London County Council cottage estate}}\n{{LCC cottage estates}}\nThe Addison Act provided subsidies solely to local authorities and not to private builders.

Act 1923]] ([[Nevil Chamberlain|Chamberlain Act]]) of 1923 stopped subsidies going to council houses but extended the subsidies to private builders. Following the line of the railways, predominantly private estates were built on cheap agricultural land; building houses that the professional classes with an income of \u00a3300- \u00a3500 a year were able to afford. <!-- Cheadle Hume, Sale, Timperley --> These pattern-book houses, put up speculatively by companies such as [[George Wimpey|Wimpey]], [[Costain Group|Costain]], [[John Laing Group|Laing]] and [[Taylor Woodrow]], were mocked by [[Osbert Lancaster]], as 'Mock Tudor' and 'By-pass variegated'.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=154}}\nLarge council estates following the line of the radial roads. <!--Kingsway, Princess Parkway, Withington, Chorlton cum Hardy--> This marked a further movement out of the city, first by the middle classes and then the blue-collar workers, leaving just the poorest layer of society living in the urban area.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=155}}\n\nThe first Labour government was returned in 1924. The [[Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1924|Wheatley Act of 1924]] restored subsidies to municipal housing but at a lower level, it failed to make any provision for lower paid, who were living in the worse conditions, and could not afford to pay the higher rents of the new houses, or travel to or from them to work. They continued in substandard housing circling the urban core; in Manchester, for example, this 'slum belt' was about half a mile wide.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=155}}\n\n<!-- this list need re-assessing\nExamples of these were built at the [[Downham Estate]] in [[London]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/case-studies/downham-estate/2|title=Why the estate was needed - Case Studies |publisher=Ideal Homes}}</ref> [[Kates Hill]] in [[Dudley]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/News/How-1920146s-Dudley-honoured-Nurse-Cavell-2.htm|title=How 1920s Dudley honoured Nurse Cavell|work=Black Country Bugle}}</ref> [[Low Hill]] in [[Wolverhampton]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/article/A-History-of-Council-Housing-in-Wolverhampton/3|title=A History of Council Housing in Wolverhampton|publisher=geograph.org.uk}}</ref> [[Weoley Castle]] in [[Birmingham]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brumagem.co.uk/ae_Weoley-area_Birmingham.htm|title=Profile: Weoley in Birmingham|publisher=brumagem.co.uk}}</ref> and [[Norris Green]] in [[Liverpool]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catalystmedia.org.uk/issues/nerve3/norris_green.htm|title=Nerve Articles - Issue 3|publisher=catalystmedia.org.uk}}</ref>\nBlocks of flats were also built.<ref>[[Chris Roberts (author)|Chris Roberts]], Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 (ISBN 0-7862-8517-6)</ref> -->===Statutory slum clearance plans===\nWhile new council housing had been built, little had been done to resolve the problem of inner-city [[slum]]s, which could also be found in many smaller towns.

Still looking for that-- but that is a tertiary source--> The bomb damage from the war only worsened the condition of Britain's housing stock, which was in poor condition before its outbreak. Before the war many social housing projects, such as the [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill Flats]] (pictured, right) in [[Leeds]] were built. However the bomb damage meant that much greater progress had to be made with [[slum clearance]] projects. In heavily bombed cities like [[London]], [[Coventry]] and [[Kingston upon Hull]], the redevelopment schemes were often larger and more radical.\n\nIn the immediate post-war years, and well into the 1950s, council house provision was shaped by the [[New Towns Act 1946]] and the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]]{{sfn|UK Parliament-New Towns|2015}} of the 1945\u201351 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government. Simultaneously, this government introduced housing legislation that removed [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] references to housing for the [[working class]] and introduced the concept of \"general needs\" construction (i.e., that council housing should aim to fill the needs of a wide range of society). In particular, [[Aneurin Bevan]], the [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister for Health and Housing]], promoted a vision of new estates where \"the working man, the doctor and the clergyman will live in close proximity to each other\". {{sfn|Panagidis|Savva|2015}}\n\nWhile a number of large cities tentatively erected their first [[high-rise]] developments (e.g., Aston Cross in [[Birmingham]], [[Churchill Gardens]] in [[Westminster]]), in [[England]] and [[Wales]] homes were typically [[semi-detached]] or in small [[Terraced house|terrace]]s. A three-bedroom semi-detached council house was typically built on a square grid {{convert|21|ft|m}} on the side, with a maximum density of houses of no more than {{Convert|12|/acre|/ha}}, that is to say around {{Convert|337|m2|sqyd}} per house. As a result, most houses had generous space around them. The [[new town]]s and many existing towns had countless estates built to this basic model. In [[Scotland]], the tradition of [[tenement]] living meant that most homes of this period were built in low-rise (3\u20134) storey blocks of [[Apartment|flat]]s.\n\nFor many working-class people, this housing model provided their first experience of private indoor toilets, private bathrooms and hot running water, as well as gardens and electric lighting. For [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] in England and Wales it also usually provided the first experience of private garden space (usually front and rear). The quality of these houses, and in particular the existence of small gardens in England and Wales, compared very favourably with social housing being built on the European continent in this period.\n\n===Focusing on a new urban vision===\nThe 1951 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government began to re-direct the building programme back from \"general needs\" towards \"welfare accommodation for low income earners\" The principal focus was on [[inner-city]] [[slum clearance]], completing the job that was started in the 1930s. \n[[Harold Macmillan#Housing Minister (1951\u201354)|Harold Macmillan]]'s task, as Minister for Housing, was to deliver 300,000 houses a year. These were {{convert|700|sqft|m2}}, 20% smaller than a Tudor Walters Bevan house, usually built as a two-bedroom terrace called \"[[People's house (United Kingdom)|The Peoples House]]\".{{sfn|Hanley|2012|pp=88-93}} {{sfn|Gimson|2013}}\nFrom 1956, with the [[Housing Subsidy Act 1956]] the government subsidy was confined to new houses built to replace those removed by slum clearance. There was more money available for blocks of more than six storeys high.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=93}} Helped by this focused subsidy, neighbourhoods throughout the country were demolished and rebuilt as mixed estates with low and high-rise building.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 6.}}\nAt the same time the rising influence of [[modernism|modernist]] architecture, the development of new cheaper construction techniques, such as [[system building]] (a form of [[prefabrication]]), and a growing desire by many towns and cities to retain [[population]] (and thus rental income and local rates) within their own boundaries (rather than \"export\" people to New Towns and \"out of boundary\" [[peripheral]] estates) led to this model being adopted; abandoned inner-city areas were demolished, and estates of high-rise apartments blocks proliferated on vacant sites.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 6.}} Whole working class communities were scattered, and the tenants either relocated themselves to neighbouring overcrowded properties or became isolated away from friends in flats and houses, on estates without infrastructure or a bus-route.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|pp=68, 69, 71}}\n\n[[Glasgow]] led the way and others followed. [[High-rise building|Tower block]]s became the preferred model. The councils visited Marseille and saw the results of [[Le Corbusier|Charles \u00c9douard Jenneret]]'s (Le Corbusier's) vision. {{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=103}}The argument was advanced that more generously sized dwellings could be provided this way, that communities could be re-housed close to existing [[employment]] opportunities and there would be far less disruption to local [[shopping]] and [[leisure]] patterns. During the 1950s and 1960s, the number of high-rise dwellings rose significantly. In 1953, just 23% of public-sector approvals were for flats, with only 3% high-rise (defined as blocks of six stories or more). By 1966, however, high-rise housing accounted for 26% of all homes started.<ref>''The Five Giants: A Biography of the Welfare State'' by Nicholas Timmins.</ref> A National Dwelling and Housing Survey carried out in 1977 also found higher levels of housing satisfaction amongst owner occupiers than council housing tenants. The survey found that 90% of owner occupiers were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with their accommodation and only 4% \"dissatisfied\" or \"very dissatisfied\", while for council tenants the equivalent figures were 74% and 14%, respectively.<ref>Labour and Inequality: A Fabian Study of Labour in Power, 1974-79 edited by Nick Bosanquet and Peter Townsend</ref>\n\nSubsequent research at the [[London School of Economics]] has tried to cast doubt on claims that only high rise developments could accommodate the [[population density]] required for these policies.<ref>R. Burdett, T. Travers, D. Czischke, P. Rode and B. Moser, ''Density and Urban Neighbourhoods in London: Summary Report'' (Enterprise [[LSE Cities]], 2004), pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nThe post-war governments considered the provision of as much new housing as possible to be a major part of post-war policy, and provided subsidies for local authorities to build such housing. The Conservatives competed with Labour for the popular vote over who could build more houses, abandoning Bevan's principle that numbers weren't enough - that the homes had to be spacious and well built, too.\n\nThe use of [[system building]] methods was later seen as possibly being a short-sighted, false economy, as many of the later houses are in a poor state of repair or have been demolished. On many estates, older council houses, with their largely superior build quality, have outlived them \u2013 more incredibly, they have even been outlasted by a large percentage of Edwardian and late Victorian private houses.{{sfn|Meek|2014|loc= page 3.}}\n\nA number of types of system building used in flats have serious flaws. They were initially very popular with tenants due to their generous space standards, and with [[councillor]]s and housing officials due to their speed of construction<ref>Glendenning, Miles, and Muthesius, Stefan (1994), ''Tower Block: Modern Public Housing in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland''.</ref> \u2013 but have suffered problems, especially poor protection from damp and weather ingress, as well as other design defects and poor management. Also, studies such as ''[[Family and Kinship in East London]]'' found that people moving to such estates lost their old social networks and failed to develop new ones.{{sfn|Meek|2014|loc= page 3}} As noted by one study:\n\n\"There was, however, one way in which slum clearance rather than enhancing housing standards actually threatened to reduce them: the building by experimented prefabricated methods, of large impersonal estates of high-rise buildings, lacking many of the amenities common in similar developments on the continent.\"<ref>The Welfare State in Britain since 1945 by Rodney Lowe</ref>\n\nThe last major push in council home provision was made under the Wilson government of 1964. The energetic Minister of Housing [[Richard Crossman]] accepted the truth that the provision rate was too slow and instructed authorities to exercise their compulsory purchase powers and construct large overspill estates.

A similar incident caused significant damage to one side of a block in [[Manchester]].\nAlthough these incidents were due to a series of failures (not least being the illegal connection of gas cookers by unqualified friends of tenants{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}), subsequently all system-built tower blocks were usually built with \"all electric\" heating, to prevent the occurrence of such an explosion.\n\nThe same year Manchester started the construction of the [[Hulme Crescents]]. Thirteen tower blocks connected by aerial walkways and the four long curving south facing blocks of flats and maisonettes connected by walkways and bridges. Five thousand homes were constructed in eight years. Three thousand of these were the deck access flats, almost immediately the constructional problems became apparent:they leaked, ducting failed and they were too expensive to heat. A child died falling from a deck and by 1975, and they were declared unsuitable for families with children, the elderly and the disabled. In 1975, 96.3% of the residents wanted to leave. 643 families petitioned to be rehoused. {{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|pp=194\u2013195}} They were demolished between 1991 and 1994.\n\nProportion of houses and flats built by local authorities and New Towns in England and Wales, 1960-80 (a)\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse sortable\"\n|-\n!

The North Hull HAT was set up to regenerate a large area of predominantly interwar council housing in the north of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Humberside]]. [[Liverpool]] HAT covered 67 of the worst tower blocks on [[Merseyside]]; 54 of these blocks were demolished and replaced by new public or private sector housing developments, while the remaining 13 blocks were refurbished. [[Stonebridge, London|Stonebridge]] HAT in [[Harlesden]], [[London]], was the final HAT to cease to exist when it was wound up in 2007, mostly covering an area of council housing built during the 1960s and 1970s. [[Waltham Forest]] HAT in [[South London]] covered several council estates, mostly built during the 1960s, and lasted until 2002, with the final phase of the regeneration being completed several years later by [[English Partnerships]]. [[Tower Hamlets]] HAT involved the regeneration of three council estates, mostly consisting of flats, in [[East London]]. Perhaps the most notable HAT was the one founded in 1993 to regenerate the [[Castle Vale]] estate in [[Birmingham]], which had been built in the 1960s.  The original master plan for the redevelopment of Castle Vale saw 17 out of 34 tower blocks on the estate earmarked for demolition, as well as 24 of the estate's 27 maisonette blocks, but by the time of the HAT's demise in 2005 all but two of the 34 tower blocks had been demolished, as well as all of the maisonette blocks and more than 100 bungalows. Community facilities on the estate were also improved, and the main shopping centre was completely redeveloped.\n\n[[File:BWFE panorama from northwest.JPG|thumb|centre|600px|[[Broadwater Farm]] in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], north London]] One of the most ambitious post-war council housing developments, the complex of [[housing estate|estate]]s at [[Broadwater Farm]] (shown above), became a national symbol of perceived failures in the council housing system following the [[Broadwater Farm riot]] in 1985.

The estates of the Addison Act are mixed tenure estates with generously proportioned semi-detached houses designed to be fit for heroes, albeit only [[affordability of housing in the United Kingdom|affordable]] by the most prosperous workers.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=94}} The generosity changed in the 1930s, with the push to eliminate the slums. [[Aneurin Bevan]]'s, new towns and estates planned to the Tudor Walters standards were designed to be the pinnacle of housing to which all classes would aspire, while [[Harold Macmillan]]'s \"pile-em high, build-em cheap\" philosophy reversed all this: firstly with his Peoples House, and then with [[Keith Joseph]]'s system-build [[High-rise building|tower block]]s.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=95}}\n\nThe earliest council estates were built within the borough boundaries on low value land that was walking distance from the places of employment. When that was exhausted, [[peripheral estate]]s were built on the edge of the town. Residents needed to commute by public transport or bicycle, as almost none of the people living in these areas had cars until well after [[World War II]].<!--Denton and Moston?--> Councils bought vacant land in neighbouring boroughs to build [[overspill estate]]s. In [[Greater Manchester]], this included [[Wythenshawe]] in the 1920s and then [[Hattersley]] in the 1960s. Later, infill estates were created on small pieces of brown field land that had been vacated by contracting heavy industry. <!-- write first and find references at leisure.-->\n\nSome pit villages, such as [[Grimethorpe]] in [[Yorkshire]], are almost entirely composed of original council housing. [[Leeds]] has [[Seacroft]] \u2013 the 'town within the city'. [[Sheffield]] boasts the award-winning [[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill]]. Both Seacroft and Park Hill are now undergoing major redevelopment. In [[Tyneside]], large council estates include [[Byker]] and [[Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne|Walker]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Felling, Tyne and Wear|Felling]] in [[Gateshead]] and [[Meadow Well]] in [[North Tyneside]], the site of violent civil disorder in 1991.

The first was the Boundary Estate. The alternative was the 'cottage estate'{{sfn|Cox|1995|p=160}}{{full citation needed|date=May 2017}} trialled at [[Totterdown Fields]], which emulated \n[[Garden city movement|garden city]] principles, though this was hampered until the [[Hampstead Garden Suburb Act 1906|1906 Hampstead Garden Suburb Act]] and the [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1909|1910 Town Planning Act]],<!-- is this the act--> removed some of the restrictions imposed by the 1875s byelaws. The [[Progress Estate]], Well Hall Road, had an open spaced layout that gave a pleasant environment to residents.{{sfn|Progress|1915}}\n\nThe [[Tudor Walters Report|Tudor Walters report]] was adopted and council estates opened up. They were designed to [[Radburn design housing|Radburn principles]] with wide feeder roads joining short cul-de-sacs. Houses were separated by at least {{convert|70|ft|m}} from the facing houses. The former gridiron street pattern was deprecated.\n\nThe [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919]] (also known as the Addison Act after [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]], [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Dr Christopher Addison]], the-then Minister for Housing), and the resulting wave of mass council housing in the early 1920s was among the first generation of houses in the country to feature electricity, running water, bathrooms, indoor toilets and front/rear gardens. However, some council houses were still being built with outdoor toilets, attached to the house, until well into the 1930s. Some of the earliest council houses did not feature an actual bathroom; the bath could often be found in the kitchen with a design that allowed it to double as a work surface. These new houses had two, three, four or five bedrooms, and generously sized back gardens intended for vegetable growing. At the best they were built at a density of houses of {{Convert|12|/acre|/ha}}. However, later in the [[20th century]] these houses were modernised to feature modern bathrooms and indoor toilets. {{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 3.}}\n\n<!-- Throttling back of funding- decline in standard- cul-de-sac to increase density and the \n  -- this section needs to give information to folks researching the purchases of 'ex-locals'\n  -->\nThe [[Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1924|Wheatley Act 1924]], reduced the expected standard in a council built house.

Most interwar council houses were built on completely new estates.\n\nThe [[Housing Act 1930]] encouraged further mass slum clearance. There was a cut in funding and the housing density on the [[peripheral estate]]s was increased; leading to a poorer build quality. The former tenants of the inner city properties, were displaced far from their workplaces unable to afford the higher rents (though reduced from the 1919 levels) or the cost of transport. Although the standard of housing improved, stable communities were broken up, and with it, support networks. {{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 4.}}\n\n===System build estates===\n[[File:Red Road flats at Balornock - geograph.org.uk - 119968.jpg|thumb|Glasgow's Red Road flats]]\nIt was not until the 1950s that mixed estates of multi-storey flats and houses became a common sight. Until then it was rare to see blocks of flats that were more than three or four storeys high. An early and famous development of council flats was at [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill]] in Leeds. Modelled on [[Karl-Marx-Hof]] flats in Vienna, the complex was built by Leeds City Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/image_galleries/image_gallery_quarry_hill_gallery.shtml?9|title=Leeds - In Pictures Quarry Hill's history |publisher=BBC}}</ref> At the time they were considered revolutionary: each flat had a motorized rubbish chute leading to a central incinerator. The complex had its own offices, shops and [[gasworks]]. The 1970s sitcom [[Queenie's Castle]] was filmed there. Long-term problems with the steel-frame structure led to demolition, beginning in 1978 and there is now no evidence of their existence. Though not in UK, the Oliver Bond flats in Dublin,Ireland were built in 1936 and have a similar design to many of the council estates in the UK today. The [[Red Road (flats)|Red Road flats]] in Glasgow were once the tallest residential buildings in Europe; but all eight towers were demolished in the 2010s.\n<!--Garages were provided on new housing developments, although these were usually in separate blocks to houses, as car ownership increased.-->\n\nBy the 1990s, many multi-storey flats and low-rise flats and maisonettes (mostly built in the 1950s and 1960s) were being demolished, due to their deteriorating condition, structural problems and a difficulty in finding new tenants when these properties became empty.\n\nOne notable regeneration programme featuring tower blocks was that of the [[Castle Vale]] estate in Birmingham, built between 1964 and 1969 to rehouse families from inner city 'slums' in areas including [[Aston]] and [[Nechells]]. 32 of the estate's 34 tower blocks were cleared between 1995 and 2004, with the remaining two being refurbished and re-opened as \"vertical warden-controlled schemes\". All of the estate's 27 maisonette blocks were also cleared, as were more than 100 bungalows. The remaining low-rise stock, however, was retained. The two remaining tower blocks were comprehensively refurbished. The sites of the demolished flats have been replaced by both private and social housing in low-rise redevelopments.<ref name=\"amc1\">{{cite book|last=Mornement |first=Adam |title=No Longer Notorious: The Revival of Castle Vale, 1993\u20132005 |publisher=Castle Vale Neighbourhood Partnership |date=March 2005 |pages=4\u201315 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Rise and Fall of Castle Vale, 1964\u20131993 |url=http://www.crp-ltd.co.uk/downloads/chapter01.pdf |format=pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe mood had changed and new [[council garden estate]]s were built. These consist of low rise dwellings, mainly houses with gardens. The high residential density, equivalent to a tower block, is achieved by pedestrianisation of the estate, which allowed the dwellings to be very close together, separated by pathways not {{Convert|11|m|ft|adj=on}} -wide roads. The resident's car park is next to the service road. Front doors open onto pedestrian areas, which thus provide safe play areas for children. An early late 1960s example of this design is [[Cressingham Gardens]]. This estate popular with its residents, and they have resisted all attempts to be resettled.<ref>{{cite news|title=A time for trust at Lambeth's Cressingham Gardens estate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/mar/08/a-time-for-trust-at-the-cressingham-gardens-estate|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Largest estates===\n[[Becontree]] in Dagenham is the largest area of council housing in the UK with a population of over 100,000.

Otherwise, the largest estates are [[Wythenshawe]] in the south of Manchester and [[Bransholme]] in the north-east of Hull. \n<!--Arron Way in [[Corby]] was a large estate, although the majority of the housing became derelict and the area is now undergoing regeneration. -->\n\nIn [[Scotland]], Glasgow has the highest proportion of social housing.

The left saw council estates as a great achievement, while successive Conservative administrations attempted to curb their spread and restrict the essential funding for maintenance. In 1951, they changed the raison d'etre from being affordable homes for all to homes only for the most needy, thereby breaking up the social mix by grouping dysfunctional families together.{{sfn|Hanley|2012}}\n\nCouncil estates could then be stereotyped as \"problem places\", where social difficulties like crime and [[welfare dependency]] are expected.

The combination of security of tenure and subsidized rent gives little incentive to tenants to downsize from family accommodation after their children have moved out. Meanwhile, those who are on the waiting list are often in much greater need of this welfare, yet they cannot have it; once a council house has been granted to a tenant, they cannot be evicted except for anti-social behaviour, serious offences committed at the premises.<ref>{{citation|last=Mack|first=Jon|year=2009|title=Possession following criminal conviction: Ground 14|journal=Landlord & Tenant Review|volume=13|issue=6|pages=209\u2013211}}</ref> Recent policy decision to reduce the supply of public housing have exacerbated this problem.

One large criticism is that it hurts labour mobility with its system of allocating housing to those in the local area. Working-class people thus face a disincentive for moving across district lines, where they would be further down the waiting list for council housing in the new districts.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe movement from a close urban society with multiple emotional and practical support mechanism to new out-of-town estates with few informal facilities has been recognised since the 1930s. Again, when residence is restricted to the poor and dysfunctional, the effect is greater. Council estates have been blamed for creating isolated community and mentality where residents have low aspirations.{{sfn|Hanley|2012}}\n\n{{quote|The truth is that council housing is a living tomb.

According to Jane Pritchard, housing lawyer, \"The local authority simply needs 'reason to believe' that the person is homeless, that they're eligible for assistance under the Housing Act, and that they are in priority need of accommodation.  Then there's a duty to provide suitable temporary accommodation immediately.\"  Pritchard maintains she continually finds cases where Local Authorities have sent victims to another authority instead of rehousing them.

Houses and flats built for public or social housing use are built by or for [[Municipality|local authorities]] and known as [[council house]]s, though since the 1980s the role of non-profit [[Housing association|housing associations]] became more important and subsequently the term \"social housing\" became more widely used, as technically council housing only refers to housing owned by a local authority, though the terms are largely used interchangeably. Before 1865, housing for the poor was provided solely by the private sector. Council houses were built on council estates, where other amenities, like schools and shops, were often also provided. From the 1950s, blocks of [[Apartment|flat]]s and three- or four-storey blocks of [[Apartment#Maisonette|maisonette]]s were widely built, alongside large developments of terraced housing, while the 1960s and (to some degree) the 1970s saw construction of many [[High-rise building|high-rise tower blocks]]. Flats and houses were also built in mixed estates.\n\nCouncil homes were built to supply uncrowded, well-built homes on [[Secure tenancy|secure tenancies]] at reasonable rents to primarily [[working-class]] people. Council housing in the mid-20th century included many large suburban \"council estates\", featuring terraced and semi-detached houses, where other amenities like schools and shops were often also provided{{sfn|Hollow|2011}}. By the late 1970s almost a third of UK households lived in social housing: some of these developments did not live up to the hopes of their supporters, and now suffer from [[urban blight]], while others became desirable locations.\n\nSince 1979, the role of council housing has changed. Housing stock has been sold under [[Right to Buy]] legislation, and new social housing has mainly been developed and managed by [[housing association]]s. A substantial part of the UK population still lives in council housing: in 2010, about 17% of UK households.<!-- later figures welcome--> Approximately 55% of the country's social housing stock is owned by local authorities \u2013 of which 15% is managed on a day-to-day basis by [[arms-length management organisation]]s, rather than the authority, and 45% by [[housing association]]s.<ref>{{citation |last=Cowan |first=David |year=2009 |title=Trust, Distrust and Betrayal |journal=[[Modern Law Review]] |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=157\u2013181 |issn= |doi= }}</ref> In Scotland, council estates are known as 'schemes'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/heritage/marking-100-years-of-scotland-s-council-houses-1-5006388|title=Marking 100 years of Scotland's council houses|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe history of public housing is the history of the housing of the poor. Even that statement is controversial, as before 1890 the state was not involved in housing policy. Public housing became needed to provide \"[[homes fit for heroes]]\" in 1919,{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc=Section 3 para. 1}}{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=60}} then to enable [[slum clearance]]. Standards were set to ensure high-quality homes. [[Aneurin Bevan]], a Labour politician, passionately believed that council houses should be provided for all, while the Conservative politician [[Harold Macmillan]] saw council housing \"as a stepping stone to home ownership\".{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=92}} The Labour government of [[Harold Wilson]] built houses and flats to the point where there was a surplus in the late 1960s. The Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] introduced Right to Buy in 1979, with the millionth council house being sold within seven years. In time the transfer of public housing stock to the private sector reached the point where councils had to rent back their own houses in order to house the homeless.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|pp=134,135}}\n\n===Before council housing===\nEven in the stable medieval model of landowner and peasant, where estate workers lived at the landowner's whim in a tied cottage, the aged and infirm needed provision from their former employer, the church or the state.{{sfn|de Pennington|2011}} <!-- could be more focussed -->\n\n====Almshouses====\n[[File:Dorset sherbone almshouses.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Almshouse]] at [[Sherborne]], [[Dorset]]]]\nThe documented history of social housing in Britain starts with [[almshouse]]s, which were established from the 10th century, to provide a place of residence for \"poor, old and distressed folk\".

This was divided into outside relief, or handouts to keep the family together, and inside relief, which meant submitting to the workhouse. The workhouse provided for two groups of people \u2013 the transient population roaming the country looking for seasonal work, and the long-term residents. The two were kept separate where possible. The long term residents included single elderly men incapable of further labour, and young women with their children\u2014often women who had been abandoned by their husbands, single mothers and servant-girls who had been dismissed from residential positions.{{sfn|de Pennington|2011}}\n\n====Migration to the city====\nThe pressure for decent housing was increased by overcrowding in the large cities during the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th century; many social commentators (such as [[Octavia Hill]]) reported on the squalor, sickness and immorality that arose. Some industrialists and independent organisations provided housing in [[Apartment building|tenement block]]s, while some [[philanthropist]] factory owners built entire villages for their workers, such as [[Saltaire]] (1853), [[Bournville]] (1879) and [[Port Sunlight]] (1888).{{sfn|UWE|2008|section=Before Council Housing}}\n\n===Council-built housing===\nThe [[City of London Corporation]] built [[tenement]]s in [[Farringdon Road]] in 1865,<ref>Tarn, J.

The [[World War I|First World War]] indirectly provided a new impetus, when the poor physical health and condition of many urban recruits to the [[British Army|army]] was noted with alarm. This led to a campaign under the slogan \"Homes fit for heroes\". In 1919, the Government first required councils to provide housing, built to the Tudor Walters standards, under the [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919]] (Addison Act), helping them to do so through the provision of subsidies.{{sfn|UK Parliament- Acts|2015}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newcastleareas.wordpress.com/2019/08/11/100-years-exhibition-the-1919-act/|title=100 years exhibition \u2013 the 1919 Act|last=Geography|first=Kay's|date=2019-08-11|website=Newcastle residential areas|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref> London County Council embraced these freedoms and planned eight 'cottage estates' in the peripheries of London: [[Becontree]], [[St Helier, London|St Helier]], [[Downham]] for example; seven further followed including [[Bellingham, London|Bellingham]]. Houses were built on green field land on the peripheries of the urban area. The war had caused house building costs to rise enormously: [[Ernest Simon, 1st Baron Simon of Wythenshawe|Sir Ernest Simon]] reported to the Manchester Housing Committee in 1910 that \"houses that had cost \u00a3250 to build pre war were then costing \u00a31,250, so the economic rent was 30/- a week but had to be let at 12/6d\".\n\nThe provision of local authority housing varied throughout the UK; in the period 1919-39 67% of the houses built in Scotland were in the public sector, compared to 26% in England.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scran.ac.uk/scotland/pdf/SP2_4Housing.pdf|title=URBAN HOUSING IN SCOTLAND 1840-1940|last=Knox|first=W.W.|website=SCRAN|publisher=Historic Environment Scotland|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===LCC cottage estates===\n{{main|London County Council cottage estate}}\n{{LCC cottage estates}}\nThe Addison Act provided subsidies solely to local authorities and not to private builders.

Act 1923]] ([[Nevil Chamberlain|Chamberlain Act]]) of 1923 stopped subsidies going to council houses but extended the subsidies to private builders. Following the line of the railways, predominantly private estates were built on cheap agricultural land; building houses that the professional classes with an income of \u00a3300- \u00a3500 a year were able to afford. <!-- Cheadle Hume, Sale, Timperley --> These pattern-book houses, put up speculatively by companies such as [[George Wimpey|Wimpey]], [[Costain Group|Costain]], [[John Laing Group|Laing]] and [[Taylor Woodrow]], were mocked by [[Osbert Lancaster]], as 'Mock Tudor' and 'By-pass variegated'.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=154}}\nLarge council estates following the line of the radial roads. <!--Kingsway, Princess Parkway, Withington, Chorlton cum Hardy--> This marked a further movement out of the city, first by the middle classes and then the blue-collar workers, leaving just the poorest layer of society living in the urban area.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=155}}\n\nThe first Labour government was returned in 1924. The [[Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1924|Wheatley Act of 1924]] restored subsidies to municipal housing but at a lower level, it failed to make any provision for lower paid, who were living in the worse conditions, and could not afford to pay the higher rents of the new houses, or travel to or from them to work. They continued in substandard housing circling the urban core; in Manchester, for example, this 'slum belt' was about half a mile wide.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=155}}\n\n<!-- this list need re-assessing\nExamples of these were built at the [[Downham Estate]] in [[London]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/case-studies/downham-estate/2|title=Why the estate was needed - Case Studies |publisher=Ideal Homes}}</ref> [[Kates Hill]] in [[Dudley]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/News/How-1920146s-Dudley-honoured-Nurse-Cavell-2.htm|title=How 1920s Dudley honoured Nurse Cavell|work=Black Country Bugle}}</ref> [[Low Hill]] in [[Wolverhampton]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/article/A-History-of-Council-Housing-in-Wolverhampton/3|title=A History of Council Housing in Wolverhampton|publisher=geograph.org.uk}}</ref> [[Weoley Castle]] in [[Birmingham]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brumagem.co.uk/ae_Weoley-area_Birmingham.htm|title=Profile: Weoley in Birmingham|publisher=brumagem.co.uk}}</ref> and [[Norris Green]] in [[Liverpool]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catalystmedia.org.uk/issues/nerve3/norris_green.htm|title=Nerve Articles - Issue 3|publisher=catalystmedia.org.uk}}</ref>\nBlocks of flats were also built.<ref>[[Chris Roberts (author)|Chris Roberts]], Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 (ISBN 0-7862-8517-6)</ref> -->===Statutory slum clearance plans===\nWhile new council housing had been built, little had been done to resolve the problem of inner-city [[slum]]s, which could also be found in many smaller towns.

Still looking for that-- but that is a tertiary source--> The bomb damage from the war only worsened the condition of Britain's housing stock, which was in poor condition before its outbreak. Before the war many social housing projects, such as the [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill Flats]] (pictured, right) in [[Leeds]] were built. However the bomb damage meant that much greater progress had to be made with [[slum clearance]] projects. In heavily bombed cities like [[London]], [[Coventry]] and [[Kingston upon Hull]], the redevelopment schemes were often larger and more radical.\n\nIn the immediate post-war years, and well into the 1950s, council house provision was shaped by the [[New Towns Act 1946]] and the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]]{{sfn|UK Parliament-New Towns|2015}} of the 1945\u201351 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government. Simultaneously, this government introduced housing legislation that removed [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] references to housing for the [[working class]] and introduced the concept of \"general needs\" construction (i.e., that council housing should aim to fill the needs of a wide range of society). In particular, [[Aneurin Bevan]], the [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister for Health and Housing]], promoted a vision of new estates where \"the working man, the doctor and the clergyman will live in close proximity to each other\". {{sfn|Panagidis|Savva|2015}}\n\nWhile a number of large cities tentatively erected their first [[high-rise]] developments (e.g., Aston Cross in [[Birmingham]], [[Churchill Gardens]] in [[Westminster]]), in [[England]] and [[Wales]] homes were typically [[semi-detached]] or in small [[Terraced house|terrace]]s. A three-bedroom semi-detached council house was typically built on a square grid {{convert|21|ft|m}} on the side, with a maximum density of houses of no more than {{Convert|12|/acre|/ha}}, that is to say around {{Convert|337|m2|sqyd}} per house. As a result, most houses had generous space around them. The [[new town]]s and many existing towns had countless estates built to this basic model. In [[Scotland]], the tradition of [[tenement]] living meant that most homes of this period were built in low-rise (3\u20134) storey blocks of [[Apartment|flat]]s.\n\nFor many working-class people, this housing model provided their first experience of private indoor toilets, private bathrooms and hot running water, as well as gardens and electric lighting. For [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] in England and Wales it also usually provided the first experience of private garden space (usually front and rear). The quality of these houses, and in particular the existence of small gardens in England and Wales, compared very favourably with social housing being built on the European continent in this period.\n\n===Focusing on a new urban vision===\nThe 1951 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government began to re-direct the building programme back from \"general needs\" towards \"welfare accommodation for low income earners\" The principal focus was on [[inner-city]] [[slum clearance]], completing the job that was started in the 1930s. \n[[Harold Macmillan#Housing Minister (1951\u201354)|Harold Macmillan]]'s task, as Minister for Housing, was to deliver 300,000 houses a year. These were {{convert|700|sqft|m2}}, 20% smaller than a Tudor Walters Bevan house, usually built as a two-bedroom terrace called \"[[People's house (United Kingdom)|The Peoples House]]\".{{sfn|Hanley|2012|pp=88-93}} {{sfn|Gimson|2013}}\nFrom 1956, with the [[Housing Subsidy Act 1956]] the government subsidy was confined to new houses built to replace those removed by slum clearance. There was more money available for blocks of more than six storeys high.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=93}} Helped by this focused subsidy, neighbourhoods throughout the country were demolished and rebuilt as mixed estates with low and high-rise building.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 6.}}\nAt the same time the rising influence of [[modernism|modernist]] architecture, the development of new cheaper construction techniques, such as [[system building]] (a form of [[prefabrication]]), and a growing desire by many towns and cities to retain [[population]] (and thus rental income and local rates) within their own boundaries (rather than \"export\" people to New Towns and \"out of boundary\" [[peripheral]] estates) led to this model being adopted; abandoned inner-city areas were demolished, and estates of high-rise apartments blocks proliferated on vacant sites.{{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 6.}} Whole working class communities were scattered, and the tenants either relocated themselves to neighbouring overcrowded properties or became isolated away from friends in flats and houses, on estates without infrastructure or a bus-route.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|pp=68, 69, 71}}\n\n[[Glasgow]] led the way and others followed. [[High-rise building|Tower block]]s became the preferred model. The councils visited Marseille and saw the results of [[Le Corbusier|Charles \u00c9douard Jenneret]]'s (Le Corbusier's) vision. {{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=103}}The argument was advanced that more generously sized dwellings could be provided this way, that communities could be re-housed close to existing [[employment]] opportunities and there would be far less disruption to local [[shopping]] and [[leisure]] patterns. During the 1950s and 1960s, the number of high-rise dwellings rose significantly. In 1953, just 23% of public-sector approvals were for flats, with only 3% high-rise (defined as blocks of six stories or more). By 1966, however, high-rise housing accounted for 26% of all homes started.<ref>''The Five Giants: A Biography of the Welfare State'' by Nicholas Timmins.</ref> A National Dwelling and Housing Survey carried out in 1977 also found higher levels of housing satisfaction amongst owner occupiers than council housing tenants. The survey found that 90% of owner occupiers were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with their accommodation and only 4% \"dissatisfied\" or \"very dissatisfied\", while for council tenants the equivalent figures were 74% and 14%, respectively.<ref>Labour and Inequality: A Fabian Study of Labour in Power, 1974-79 edited by Nick Bosanquet and Peter Townsend</ref>\n\nSubsequent research at the [[London School of Economics]] has tried to cast doubt on claims that only high rise developments could accommodate the [[population density]] required for these policies.<ref>R. Burdett, T. Travers, D. Czischke, P. Rode and B. Moser, ''Density and Urban Neighbourhoods in London: Summary Report'' (Enterprise [[LSE Cities]], 2004), pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nThe post-war governments considered the provision of as much new housing as possible to be a major part of post-war policy, and provided subsidies for local authorities to build such housing. The Conservatives competed with Labour for the popular vote over who could build more houses, abandoning Bevan's principle that numbers weren't enough - that the homes had to be spacious and well built, too.\n\nThe use of [[system building]] methods was later seen as possibly being a short-sighted, false economy, as many of the later houses are in a poor state of repair or have been demolished. On many estates, older council houses, with their largely superior build quality, have outlived them \u2013 more incredibly, they have even been outlasted by a large percentage of Edwardian and late Victorian private houses.{{sfn|Meek|2014|loc= page 3.}}\n\nA number of types of system building used in flats have serious flaws. They were initially very popular with tenants due to their generous space standards, and with [[councillor]]s and housing officials due to their speed of construction<ref>Glendenning, Miles, and Muthesius, Stefan (1994), ''Tower Block: Modern Public Housing in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland''.</ref> \u2013 but have suffered problems, especially poor protection from damp and weather ingress, as well as other design defects and poor management. Also, studies such as ''[[Family and Kinship in East London]]'' found that people moving to such estates lost their old social networks and failed to develop new ones.{{sfn|Meek|2014|loc= page 3}} As noted by one study:\n\n\"There was, however, one way in which slum clearance rather than enhancing housing standards actually threatened to reduce them: the building by experimented prefabricated methods, of large impersonal estates of high-rise buildings, lacking many of the amenities common in similar developments on the continent.\"<ref>The Welfare State in Britain since 1945 by Rodney Lowe</ref>\n\nThe last major push in council home provision was made under the Wilson government of 1964. The energetic Minister of Housing [[Richard Crossman]] accepted the truth that the provision rate was too slow and instructed authorities to exercise their compulsory purchase powers and construct large overspill estates. In [[Birmingham]] he forced the building of [[Castle Vale]] and the 15,590 dwelling [[Chelmsley Wood]] estate, [[Solihull]]. {{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=29}}<ref name=cw-hist>{{cite web|title=History of Chelmsley Wood|url=http://www.solihull.gov.uk/Resident/Libraries/Local-family-history/localhistory/chelmsleywoodhistory|publisher=Metropolitan Borough of Solihull|accessdate=14 January 2016|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Right to buy===\n[[File:Dwellings completed in England 1946-2015.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Permanent dwellings completed in England by tenure type, showing the effect of the 1980 Housing Act in curtailing council house construction and reducing total new build numbers]]\nLaws restricted councils' investment in housing, preventing them subsidising it from local taxes, but more importantly, council tenants were given the [[Right to Buy]] in the [[Housing Act 1980]] offering a discount price on their council house.

The North Hull HAT was set up to regenerate a large area of predominantly interwar council housing in the north of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Humberside]]. [[Liverpool]] HAT covered 67 of the worst tower blocks on [[Merseyside]]; 54 of these blocks were demolished and replaced by new public or private sector housing developments, while the remaining 13 blocks were refurbished. [[Stonebridge, London|Stonebridge]] HAT in [[Harlesden]], [[London]], was the final HAT to cease to exist when it was wound up in 2007, mostly covering an area of council housing built during the 1960s and 1970s. [[Waltham Forest]] HAT in [[South London]] covered several council estates, mostly built during the 1960s, and lasted until 2002, with the final phase of the regeneration being completed several years later by [[English Partnerships]]. [[Tower Hamlets]] HAT involved the regeneration of three council estates, mostly consisting of flats, in [[East London]]. Perhaps the most notable HAT was the one founded in 1993 to regenerate the [[Castle Vale]] estate in [[Birmingham]], which had been built in the 1960s.  The original master plan for the redevelopment of Castle Vale saw 17 out of 34 tower blocks on the estate earmarked for demolition, as well as 24 of the estate's 27 maisonette blocks, but by the time of the HAT's demise in 2005 all but two of the 34 tower blocks had been demolished, as well as all of the maisonette blocks and more than 100 bungalows. Community facilities on the estate were also improved, and the main shopping centre was completely redeveloped.\n\n[[File:BWFE panorama from northwest.JPG|thumb|centre|600px|[[Broadwater Farm]] in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], north London]] One of the most ambitious post-war council housing developments, the complex of [[housing estate|estate]]s at [[Broadwater Farm]] (shown above), became a national symbol of perceived failures in the council housing system following the [[Broadwater Farm riot]] in 1985.

The estates of the Addison Act are mixed tenure estates with generously proportioned semi-detached houses designed to be fit for heroes, albeit only [[affordability of housing in the United Kingdom|affordable]] by the most prosperous workers.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=94}} The generosity changed in the 1930s, with the push to eliminate the slums. [[Aneurin Bevan]]'s, new towns and estates planned to the Tudor Walters standards were designed to be the pinnacle of housing to which all classes would aspire, while [[Harold Macmillan]]'s \"pile-em high, build-em cheap\" philosophy reversed all this: firstly with his Peoples House, and then with [[Keith Joseph]]'s system-build [[High-rise building|tower block]]s.{{sfn|Hanley|2012|p=95}}\n\nThe earliest council estates were built within the borough boundaries on low value land that was walking distance from the places of employment. When that was exhausted, [[peripheral estate]]s were built on the edge of the town. Residents needed to commute by public transport or bicycle, as almost none of the people living in these areas had cars until well after [[World War II]].<!--Denton and Moston?--> Councils bought vacant land in neighbouring boroughs to build [[overspill estate]]s. In [[Greater Manchester]], this included [[Wythenshawe]] in the 1920s and then [[Hattersley]] in the 1960s. Later, infill estates were created on small pieces of brown field land that had been vacated by contracting heavy industry. <!-- write first and find references at leisure.-->\n\nSome pit villages, such as [[Grimethorpe]] in [[Yorkshire]], are almost entirely composed of original council housing. [[Leeds]] has [[Seacroft]] \u2013 the 'town within the city'. [[Sheffield]] boasts the award-winning [[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill]]. Both Seacroft and Park Hill are now undergoing major redevelopment. In [[Tyneside]], large council estates include [[Byker]] and [[Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne|Walker]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Felling, Tyne and Wear|Felling]] in [[Gateshead]] and [[Meadow Well]] in [[North Tyneside]], the site of violent civil disorder in 1991.

The first was the Boundary Estate. The alternative was the 'cottage estate'{{sfn|Cox|1995|p=160}}{{full citation needed|date=May 2017}} trialled at [[Totterdown Fields]], which emulated \n[[Garden city movement|garden city]] principles, though this was hampered until the [[Hampstead Garden Suburb Act 1906|1906 Hampstead Garden Suburb Act]] and the [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1909|1910 Town Planning Act]],<!-- is this the act--> removed some of the restrictions imposed by the 1875s byelaws. The [[Progress Estate]], Well Hall Road, had an open spaced layout that gave a pleasant environment to residents.{{sfn|Progress|1915}}\n\nThe [[Tudor Walters Report|Tudor Walters report]] was adopted and council estates opened up. They were designed to [[Radburn design housing|Radburn principles]] with wide feeder roads joining short cul-de-sacs. Houses were separated by at least {{convert|70|ft|m}} from the facing houses. The former gridiron street pattern was deprecated.\n\nThe [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919]] (also known as the Addison Act after [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]], [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Dr Christopher Addison]], the-then Minister for Housing), and the resulting wave of mass council housing in the early 1920s was among the first generation of houses in the country to feature electricity, running water, bathrooms, indoor toilets and front/rear gardens. However, some council houses were still being built with outdoor toilets, attached to the house, until well into the 1930s. Some of the earliest council houses did not feature an actual bathroom; the bath could often be found in the kitchen with a design that allowed it to double as a work surface. These new houses had two, three, four or five bedrooms, and generously sized back gardens intended for vegetable growing. At the best they were built at a density of houses of {{Convert|12|/acre|/ha}}. However, later in the [[20th century]] these houses were modernised to feature modern bathrooms and indoor toilets. {{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 3.}}\n\n<!-- Throttling back of funding- decline in standard- cul-de-sac to increase density and the \n  -- this section needs to give information to folks researching the purchases of 'ex-locals'\n  -->\nThe [[Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1924|Wheatley Act 1924]], reduced the expected standard in a council built house.

Most interwar council houses were built on completely new estates.\n\nThe [[Housing Act 1930]] encouraged further mass slum clearance. There was a cut in funding and the housing density on the [[peripheral estate]]s was increased; leading to a poorer build quality. The former tenants of the inner city properties, were displaced far from their workplaces unable to afford the higher rents (though reduced from the 1919 levels) or the cost of transport. Although the standard of housing improved, stable communities were broken up, and with it, support networks. {{sfn|UWE|2008|loc= Section 4.}}\n\n===System build estates===\n[[File:Red Road flats at Balornock - geograph.org.uk - 119968.jpg|thumb|Glasgow's Red Road flats]]\nIt was not until the 1950s that mixed estates of multi-storey flats and houses became a common sight. Until then it was rare to see blocks of flats that were more than three or four storeys high. An early and famous development of council flats was at [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill]] in Leeds. Modelled on [[Karl-Marx-Hof]] flats in Vienna, the complex was built by Leeds City Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/image_galleries/image_gallery_quarry_hill_gallery.shtml?9|title=Leeds - In Pictures Quarry Hill's history |publisher=BBC}}</ref> At the time they were considered revolutionary: each flat had a motorized rubbish chute leading to a central incinerator. The complex had its own offices, shops and [[gasworks]]. The 1970s sitcom [[Queenie's Castle]] was filmed there. Long-term problems with the steel-frame structure led to demolition, beginning in 1978 and there is now no evidence of their existence. Though not in UK, the Oliver Bond flats in Dublin,Ireland were built in 1936 and have a similar design to many of the council estates in the UK today. The [[Red Road (flats)|Red Road flats]] in Glasgow were once the tallest residential buildings in Europe; but all eight towers were demolished in the 2010s.\n<!--Garages were provided on new housing developments, although these were usually in separate blocks to houses, as car ownership increased.-->\n\nBy the 1990s, many multi-storey flats and low-rise flats and maisonettes (mostly built in the 1950s and 1960s) were being demolished, due to their deteriorating condition, structural problems and a difficulty in finding new tenants when these properties became empty.\n\nOne notable regeneration programme featuring tower blocks was that of the [[Castle Vale]] estate in Birmingham, built between 1964 and 1969 to rehouse families from inner city 'slums' in areas including [[Aston]] and [[Nechells]]. 32 of the estate's 34 tower blocks were cleared between 1995 and 2004, with the remaining two being refurbished and re-opened as \"vertical warden-controlled schemes\". All of the estate's 27 maisonette blocks were also cleared, as were more than 100 bungalows. The remaining low-rise stock, however, was retained. The two remaining tower blocks were comprehensively refurbished. The sites of the demolished flats have been replaced by both private and social housing in low-rise redevelopments.<ref name=\"amc1\">{{cite book|last=Mornement |first=Adam |title=No Longer Notorious: The Revival of Castle Vale, 1993\u20132005 |publisher=Castle Vale Neighbourhood Partnership |date=March 2005 |pages=4\u201315 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Rise and Fall of Castle Vale, 1964\u20131993 |url=http://www.crp-ltd.co.uk/downloads/chapter01.pdf |format=pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe mood had changed and new [[council garden estate]]s were built. These consist of low rise dwellings, mainly houses with gardens. The high residential density, equivalent to a tower block, is achieved by pedestrianisation of the estate, which allowed the dwellings to be very close together, separated by pathways not {{Convert|11|m|ft|adj=on}} -wide roads. The resident's car park is next to the service road. Front doors open onto pedestrian areas, which thus provide safe play areas for children. An early late 1960s example of this design is [[Cressingham Gardens]]. This estate popular with its residents, and they have resisted all attempts to be resettled.<ref>{{cite news|title=A time for trust at Lambeth's Cressingham Gardens estate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/mar/08/a-time-for-trust-at-the-cressingham-gardens-estate|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Largest estates===\n[[Becontree]] in Dagenham is the largest area of council housing in the UK with a population of over 100,000. It forms the bulk of a town. It was built during the 1920s and early 1930s. Otherwise, the largest estates are [[Wythenshawe]] in the south of Manchester and [[Bransholme]] in the north-east of Hull. \n<!--Arron Way in [[Corby]] was a large estate, although the majority of the housing became derelict and the area is now undergoing regeneration. -->\n\nIn [[Scotland]], Glasgow has the highest proportion of social housing. The largest estates include [[Drumchapel]], [[Easterhouse]], [[Castlemilk]] and [[Pollok]]. In Edinburgh there are several smaller peripheral estates such as [[Craigmillar]], [[Wester Hailes]] and [[Sighthill, Edinburgh|Sighthill]]. The large council estates in \n[[Wales]] include [[Caia Park]] in [[Wrexham]], [[Bettws, Newport|Bettws]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] and [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]] in [[Cardiff]]. <!-- stats not checked -->\n\n==Public housing debate==\nThe debate on public housing provision is politically polarised, as can be seen in the large number of parliamentary acts referred to above. The left saw council estates as a great achievement, while successive Conservative administrations attempted to curb their spread and restrict the essential funding for maintenance. In 1951, they changed the raison d'etre from being affordable homes for all to homes only for the most needy, thereby breaking up the social mix by grouping dysfunctional families together.{{sfn|Hanley|2012}}\n\nCouncil estates could then be stereotyped as \"problem places\", where social difficulties like crime and [[welfare dependency]] are expected. Estates with particularly marked economic and social deprivation are derogated as [[sink estate]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://policypress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1332/policypress/9781861348159.001.0001/upso-9781861348159-chapter-8|title='Problem' people, 'problemg places?

The combination of security of tenure and subsidized rent gives little incentive to tenants to downsize from family accommodation after their children have moved out. Meanwhile, those who are on the waiting list are often in much greater need of this welfare, yet they cannot have it; once a council house has been granted to a tenant, they cannot be evicted except for anti-social behaviour, serious offences committed at the premises.<ref>{{citation|last=Mack|first=Jon|year=2009|title=Possession following criminal conviction: Ground 14|journal=Landlord & Tenant Review|volume=13|issue=6|pages=209\u2013211}}</ref> Recent policy decision to reduce the supply of public housing have exacerbated this problem. The Cameron government has addressed this shortage by imposing a [[bedroom tax]] to encourage movement.{{sfn|Hanley|2012}}\n\nSocial policy economists, such as [[Anthony J. Culyer|Culyer]] and Barr, have been critical of the role that council housing plays in attempts to help the [[Poverty in the United Kingdom|poor]]. One large criticism is that it hurts labour mobility with its system of allocating housing to those in the local area. Working-class people thus face a disincentive for moving across district lines, where they would be further down the waiting list for council housing in the new districts.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe movement from a close urban society with multiple emotional and practical support mechanism to new out-of-town estates with few informal facilities has been recognised since the 1930s. Again, when residence is restricted to the poor and dysfunctional, the effect is greater. Council estates have been blamed for creating isolated community and mentality where residents have low aspirations.{{sfn|Hanley|2012}}\n\n{{quote|The truth is that council housing is a living tomb.
