Erisman,<ref name=\"tran06\"/> and began writing for the company's [[comic-book]] lines [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s precursors of [[Marvel Comics]]. After Goodman ceased publishing pulps in favor of [[mass market paperback|paperback books]] and [[men's adventure]] magazines, Keyes became an associate editor of Atlas<ref name=\"sfwa140617\"/> under editor-in-chief and [[art director]] [[Stan Lee]]. Circa 1952, Keyes was one of several staff writers, officially titled editors, who wrote for such [[horror fiction|horror]] and science fiction comics as ''Journey into Unknown Worlds'', for which Keyes wrote two stories with artist [[Basil Wolverton]].<ref name=gcd />\n\nAs Keyes recalled, Goodman offered him a job under Lee after ''Marvel Science Stories'' ceased publication:\n\n{{quote|Since my $1700.25-a-month rent was almost due, I accepted what I considered a detour on my journey toward a literary career. Stan Lee ... let his editors deal with the scriptwriters, cartoonists, and [[letterer|lettering]] crew. Writers turned in plot synopses, Stan read them, and as a matter of course, would accept one or two from each of the regulars he referred to as his \"stable.\" As one of his front men, I would pass along comments and criticism. ... Because of my experience editing ''Marvel'' and because I'd sold a few science fiction stories by then, Stan allowed me to specialize in the horror, fantasy, suspense, and science fiction comic books. Naturally, I began submitting story ideas, getting freelance assignment, and supplementing my salary by writing scripts on my own time.<ref name=autobiop79-80/>}}\n\nOne story idea Keyes wrote but did not submit to Lee was called \"Brainstorm\", the paragraph-long synopsis that would evolve into ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]''. It begins: \"The first guy in the test to raise the I.Q. from a low normal 90 to genius level ... He goes through the experience and then is thrown back to what was.\" Keyes recalled, \"something told me it should be more than a comic book script.\"<ref name=autobiop79-80/>\n\nFrom 1955 to 1956, Keyes wrote for [[EC Comics]], including its titles ''Shock Illustrated'' and ''Confessions Illustrated'', under both his own name and the pseudonyms '''Kris Daniels''' and '''A.D. Locke'''.<ref name=gcd/>\n\n===''Flowers for Algernon''===\n{{Main|Flowers for Algernon}}\nThe short story and subsequent novel, ''Flowers for Algernon'', is written as progress reports of a mentally disabled man, Charlie, who undergoes experimental surgery and briefly becomes a genius before the effects tragically wear off. The story was initially published in the April 1959 issue of ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'' and the expanded novel in 1966.<ref name=\"nyt140617\"/> The novel has been adapted several times for other media, most prominently as the 1968 film ''[[Charly]]'', starring [[Cliff Robertson]] (who won an [[Academy Award]] for Best Actor) and [[Claire Bloom]]. Keyes also won the [[Hugo Award]] in 1959 and the [[Nebula Award]] in 1966 for the story.<ref name=\"sfwa140617\"/><ref name=\"wapo140618\"/>\n\n===Later career===\nKeyes taught creative writing at [[Wayne State University]], and in 1966 he became an English and creative writing professor at [[Ohio University]], in [[Athens, Ohio]], where he was honored as a professor emeritus in 2000.{{r|budrys196608}}<ref name=\"wint03\"/><ref name=\"ohio02\"/>\n\n===Death===\nKeyes died at his home in [[Boca Raton]] on June 15, 2014, due to complications from [[pneumonia]].<ref name=\"nyt140617\"/><ref name=\"loc140617\"/><ref name=\"star140618\"/> His wife Aurea Georgina Vazquez, whom he married in 1952, had died in 2014..

After Goodman ceased publishing pulps in favor of [[mass market paperback|paperback books]] and [[men's adventure]] magazines, Keyes became an associate editor of Atlas<ref name=\"sfwa140617\"/> under editor-in-chief and [[art director]] [[Stan Lee]]. Circa 1952, Keyes was one of several staff writers, officially titled editors, who wrote for such [[horror fiction|horror]] and science fiction comics as ''Journey into Unknown Worlds'', for which Keyes wrote two stories with artist [[Basil Wolverton]].<ref name=gcd />\n\nAs Keyes recalled, Goodman offered him a job under Lee after ''Marvel Science Stories'' ceased publication:\n\n{{quote|Since my $1700.25-a-month rent was almost due, I accepted what I considered a detour on my journey toward a literary career. Stan Lee ... let his editors deal with the scriptwriters, cartoonists, and [[letterer|lettering]] crew. Writers turned in plot synopses, Stan read them, and as a matter of course, would accept one or two from each of the regulars he referred to as his \"stable.\" As one of his front men, I would pass along comments and criticism. ... Because of my experience editing ''Marvel'' and because I'd sold a few science fiction stories by then, Stan allowed me to specialize in the horror, fantasy, suspense, and science fiction comic books. Naturally, I began submitting story ideas, getting freelance assignment, and supplementing my salary by writing scripts on my own time.<ref name=autobiop79-80/>}}\n\nOne story idea Keyes wrote but did not submit to Lee was called \"Brainstorm\", the paragraph-long synopsis that would evolve into ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]''. It begins: \"The first guy in the test to raise the I.Q. from a low normal 90 to genius level ... He goes through the experience and then is thrown back to what was.\" Keyes recalled, \"something told me it should be more than a comic book script.\"<ref name=autobiop79-80/>\n\nFrom 1955 to 1956, Keyes wrote for [[EC Comics]], including its titles ''Shock Illustrated'' and ''Confessions Illustrated'', under both his own name and the pseudonyms '''Kris Daniels''' and '''A.D.

Over the course of the battle, the Liberal fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelite fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelite four, managed to close with the Miguelites, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelite fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG01\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG02\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelite crews proved no match for the Liberal crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelite fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelite fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]].<ref name=\"RG19\">Roche, (2005)</ref> The Miguelite-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.<ref name=\"RG03\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG04\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Almirante_Charles_Napier_-_John_Simpson_(attributed),_after_1834,_Museu_Nacional_Soares_dos_Reis.png|thumb|right|upright=1|A portrait of Napier in 1834, at the conclusion of the war.]]\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Liberal Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as [[Admiral]] of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]].<ref name=\"RG05\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG06\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as [[Vice Admiral]], Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Liberal to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelite forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully [[Landing operation|disembarking]] this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelite admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG07\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG08\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelite fleet. The Miguelite fleet significantly outnumbered the Liberal one, and aimed to defeat the Liberal via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as [[tugs]], but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the [[Age of Sail]] that was entirely fought by [[Tall ships|sailing ships]]. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns.<ref name=\"RG09\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG10\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelite vessels and attempt to [[Naval boarding|board]] and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his [[flagship]] leading the [[Sailing ship tactics|manoeuvre]], the Liberal fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelite fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelites desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Liberal victory was that the majority of the Liberal crews were British [[veterans]] from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelite fleet. In the battle the Liberal forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Liberal cause and swear allegiance to [[Pedro I of Brazil|Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelite fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelite fleet, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros.<ref name=\"RG11\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG12\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelite fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Liberal fleet and the captured Miguelite prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelites had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Liberal victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the [[Navy Directory|Royal Navy List]] at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews, was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the apogee of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\"RG13\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG14\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelite ''The Lord of the Isles'' [[Steamboat|steamer]] at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Liberal cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Liberal and Miguelite armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Liberal victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelite army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834.

Vincent]] between a Liberal fleet under the command of British [[Officer (armed forces)|naval officer]] [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Charles Napier]] against a [[Miguelist|Miguelite]] fleet under the command of Portugese naval officer Manuel Marreiros, which was fought on 5 July 1833 during the [[Liberal Wars]] and resulted in a decisive victory for the Liberal fleet. Over the course of the battle, the Liberal fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelite fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelite four, managed to close with the Miguelites, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelite fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG01\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG02\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelite crews proved no match for the Liberal crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelite fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelite fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]].<ref name=\"RG19\">Roche, (2005)</ref> The Miguelite-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.<ref name=\"RG03\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG04\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Almirante_Charles_Napier_-_John_Simpson_(attributed),_after_1834,_Museu_Nacional_Soares_dos_Reis.png|thumb|right|upright=1|A portrait of Napier in 1834, at the conclusion of the war.]]\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Liberal Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as [[Admiral]] of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]].<ref name=\"RG05\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG06\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as [[Vice Admiral]], Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Liberal to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelite forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully [[Landing operation|disembarking]] this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelite admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG07\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG08\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelite fleet. The Miguelite fleet significantly outnumbered the Liberal one, and aimed to defeat the Liberal via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as [[tugs]], but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns.<ref name=\"RG09\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG10\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelite vessels and attempt to [[Naval boarding|board]] and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his [[flagship]] leading the [[Sailing ship tactics|manoeuvre]], the Liberal fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelite fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelites desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Liberal victory was that the majority of the Liberal crews were British [[veterans]] from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelite fleet. In the battle the Liberal forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Liberal cause and swear allegiance to [[Pedro I of Brazil|Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelite fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelite fleet, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros.<ref name=\"RG11\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG12\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelite fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Liberal fleet and the captured Miguelite prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelites had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Liberal victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the [[Navy Directory|Royal Navy List]] at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\"RG13\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG14\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelite ''The Lord of the Isles'' [[Steamboat|steamer]] at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Liberal cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Liberal and Miguelite armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Liberal victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelite army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal.
