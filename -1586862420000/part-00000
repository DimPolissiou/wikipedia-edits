The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 until 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945.\n\nAutomobiles are marketed under the brands BMW, [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] and [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]], and motorcycles are marketed under the brand [[BMW Motorrad]].

BMW has significant motorsport history, especially in [[touring car racing|touring cars]], [[Formula 1]], [[sports car racing|sports cars]] and the [[Isle of Man TT]].\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n''Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG'' was formed in 1916. This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s.

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Automobiles ==\n=== Current models ===\n{{See also|List of BMW vehicles|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\n* '''[[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]''' five-door hatchbacks (model code [[BMW 1 Series (F40)|F40]]).

Its name comes from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''lesnice'', meaning \u201cforest place\u201d.\n\n== Geography ==\nL\u00f6\u00dfnitz is a small town in the western part of the [[Ore Mountains]] lying nestled among wooded mountain ranges in a glen, roughly 432&nbsp;m above sea level. It lies 4&nbsp;km northeast of [[Aue]] and 27&nbsp;km southwest of [[Chemnitz]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nL\u00f6\u00dfnitz has six ''Ortsteile'' (constituent communities), namely Affalter (since 1999), Dittersdorf (since 1973), Gr\u00fcna (from 1974 a constituent community of Affalter), Dreihansen (said to have been a self-standing community in 1791), Niederl\u00f6\u00dfnitz (since 1898) and Streitwald (from 1939 a constituent community of Affalter).\n\n== History ==\nL\u00f6\u00dfnitz was founded by the Castle Counts (''Burggrafen'') at [[Mei\u00dfen]] in 1170, and in a document from 1284 it was already described as a ''Civitas''. The town's first documentary mention, however, had already come in 1238, in which it was named as \u201cLesnitz the forest place\u201d.\n\nL\u00f6\u00dfnitz's early history is somewhat speculative. A schoolmaster is mentioned as being in the town in 1304, for instance, leading to the inference that the L\u00f6\u00dfnitz Latin school was already there then. Likewise, the first known [[mayor]] Hermann von Buten appears in the town's history in 1372, leading to further speculation that there must have been a [[town hall]] by that time.\n\nIn 1382, L\u00f6\u00dfnitz was designated a ''Bergstadt'' and a year later the whole town burnt right down as far as the town mill that stood before the gates. In 1406, the Count of Sch\u00f6nburg acquired the County of Hartenstein and made L\u00f6\u00dfnitz its seat.\n\nIn 1542, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced. In 1601, the town hall portal appeared and the town hall remodelling was finished six years later. However, all of it was lost, along with the church, the parish building, the school and moreover 108 houses, in the \u201cRote Ruhr\u201d (\u201cRed Dysentery\u201d, a name given this town fire). In the years that followed, the town also had to deal with sackings, the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and yet another town fire.\n\nIn 1714, the [[Baroque]] ''Hospitalkirche'' (\u201cHospital Church\u201d) was consecrated. Town fires were nothing unusual in those days, and on 10 December 1806 it once again came to pass and among the buildings lost were, again, the town hall, the parish building and the school as well as the mediaeval ''St. Johanniskirche'' (church), the [[brewing]] and [[malting]] house, 182 houses and 16 barns. The town sprang back from this, but only three years later, there was yet another fire, this one started by a [[lightning]] strike. Of the 104 houses that were destroyed, 26 were ones that had already been rebuilt after burning down in the last fire. On 29 October 1826 the new church, ''Haupt- und Stadtkirche St. Johannis'', was consecrated. There were later further fires in L\u00f6\u00dfnitz, whereby the Baroque ''Hospitalkirche'' was destroyed, too.\n\nAfter jurisdiction over the town had been relinquished to the House of Sch\u00f6nburg, the ''F\u00fcrstlich Sch\u00f6nburgische Justizamt Stein'' (\u201cPrincely Sch\u00f6nburg Justice Office of Stein\u201d) came into being in 1861, and that same year, the new ''Hospitalkirche'' was consecrated. When the Sch\u00f6nburg principalities were taken over by the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] in 1878, L\u00f6\u00dfnitz was given a Kingdom of Saxony ''[[Amt (administrative division)|Amt]]'' court, which persisted until 1931.\n\nIn 1917, the bells at both the ''St. Johanniskirche'' and the ''Hospitalkirche'' were removed for war requirements, but only three years later, the former acquired three new bells. In 1939, a [[carillon]] consisting of 23 [[bronze]] bells was installed in the church's spire.\n\nOn 20 April 1945, the town's deputy mayor Rudolf Weber, who wanted to surrender the town to the [[United States|Americans]] without a fight, was shot by the [[Waffen-SS]]. Between 1985 and 1992 there arose on the edge of town a great [[residential area]], where today almost half the town's population lives.\n\nIn 1999 came the amalgamation of the community of Affalter.\n\n=== Population development ===\nThe following population figures refer to 31 December of each given year.\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" \n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" | \n'''1982 to 1988'''\n* 1982 \u2212 8876\n* 1983 \u2212 8780\n* 1984 \u2212 8724\n* 1985 \u2212 8648\n* 1986 \u2212 8500\n* 1987 \u2212 8484\n* 1988 \u2212 10205\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" | \n'''1989 to 1995'''\n* 1989 \u2212 11620\n* 1990 \u2212 12270\n* 1991 \u2212 12951\n* 1992 \u2212 13098\n* 1993 \u2212 13056\n* 1994 \u2212 12801\n* 1995 \u2212 12555\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" | \n'''1996 to 2002'''\n* 1996 \u2212 12302\n* 1997 \u2212 12041\n* 1998 \u2212 11760\n* 1999 \u2212 11527\n* 2000 \u2212 11262\n* 2001 \u2212 11068\n* 2002 \u2212 10769\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" | \n'''2003 to 2006'''\n* 2003 \u2212 10601\n* 2004 \u2212 10479\n* 2005 \u2212 10374\n* 2006 \u2212 10184\n|}\n:<small> Source: ''Statistisches Landesamt des Freistaates Sachsen''</small>\n\n=== Niederl\u00f6\u00dfnitz ===\nToday's constituent community of Niederl\u00f6\u00dfnitz (\u201cLower L\u00f6\u00dfnitz\u201d) was originally a farming village downstream from where the Aubach empties into the L\u00f6\u00dfnitzbach. The first known naming of the community goes back to 1497, when it was known as ''Niderlesenitzs''. About 100 years later, the community counted 6 landowners. One estate was exempted from combat duty and served as the lordly hunting lodge. A. Schuhmann mentioned in 1820 in his ''Lexikon'' two flour mills and a paper mill. However, the paper mill, which had supposedly once been a hammerworks and a coin blank works, burnt down in 1808 and was never rebuilt. Towards the end of the 19th century, the [[railway]] line between [[Zw\u00f6nitz]] and Aue, on which the lower railway station was built somewhat later, came into service. After the station was built came residential areas and industrial development, leading eventually to Niederl\u00f6\u00dfnitz's amalgamation with the Town of L\u00f6\u00dfnitz in 1898.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nL\u00f6\u00dfnitz's arms show a black [[saltire|Saint Andrew's cross]] (the arms of the Castle Counts at Mei\u00dfen, the town's founders) on a yellow background. The cross is surrounded by three towers set on a stylized wall on a red background. The wall and towers refer to the town's former formidable fortifications; the three towers symbolize the three former town gates.\n\n=== Town partnership ===\nSince 1991 there has been a partnership with the Westphalian town of [[Borgholzhausen]].\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n=== Buildings ===\n[[File:Johanniskirche L\u00f6\u00dfnitz.jpg|thumb|St.Johanniskirche]]\n* Old Town\n* Parts of the former town wall (\u201cR\u00f6sselturm\u201d) \n* Town Hall from 1601\n* ''St. Johanniskirche'' with [[carillon]].

With widespread industrialization beginning about the year 1850, L\u00f6\u00dfnitz became one of the most important industrial centres in the western Ore Mountains. Important businesses were in [[shoemaking]], machine building, [[textile]] refining and processing and metalware. [[Slate]] mining around the town was also important for a long while.

Its name comes from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''lesnice'', meaning \u201cforest place\u201d.\n\n== Geography ==\nL\u00f6\u00dfnitz is a small town in the western part of the [[Ore Mountains]] lying nestled among wooded mountain ranges in a glen, roughly 432&nbsp;m above sea level. It lies 4&nbsp;km northeast of [[Aue]] and 27&nbsp;km southwest of [[Chemnitz]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nL\u00f6\u00dfnitz has six ''Ortsteile'' (constituent communities), namely Affalter (since 1999), Dittersdorf (since 1973), Gr\u00fcna (from 1974 a constituent community of Affalter), Dreihansen (said to have been a self-standing community in 1791), Niederl\u00f6\u00dfnitz (since 1898) and Streitwald (from 1939 a constituent community of Affalter).\n\n== History ==\nL\u00f6\u00dfnitz was founded by the Castle Counts (''Burggrafen'') at [[Mei\u00dfen]] in 1170, and in a document from 1284 it was already described as a ''Civitas''. The town's first documentary mention, however, had already come in 1238, in which it was named as \u201cLesnitz the forest place\u201d.\n\nL\u00f6\u00dfnitz's early history is somewhat speculative. A schoolmaster is mentioned as being in the town in 1304, for instance, leading to the inference that the L\u00f6\u00dfnitz Latin school was already there then. Likewise, the first known [[mayor]] Hermann von Buten appears in the town's history in 1372, leading to further speculation that there must have been a [[town hall]] by that time.\n\nIn 1382, L\u00f6\u00dfnitz was designated a ''Bergstadt'' and a year later the whole town burnt right down as far as the town mill that stood before the gates. In 1406, the Count of Sch\u00f6nburg acquired the County of Hartenstein and made L\u00f6\u00dfnitz its seat.\n\nIn 1542, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced. In 1601, the town hall portal appeared and the town hall remodelling was finished six years later. However, all of it was lost, along with the church, the parish building, the school and moreover 108 houses, in the \u201cRote Ruhr\u201d (\u201cRed Dysentery\u201d, a name given this town fire). In the years that followed, the town also had to deal with sackings, the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and yet another town fire.\n\nIn 1714, the [[Baroque]] ''Hospitalkirche'' (\u201cHospital Church\u201d) was consecrated. Town fires were nothing unusual in those days, and on 10 December 1806 it once again came to pass and among the buildings lost were, again, the town hall, the parish building and the school as well as the mediaeval ''St. Johanniskirche'' (church), the [[brewing]] and [[malting]] house, 182 houses and 16 barns. The town sprang back from this, but only three years later, there was yet another fire, this one started by a [[lightning]] strike. Of the 104 houses that were destroyed, 26 were ones that had already been rebuilt after burning down in the last fire. On 29 October 1826 the new church, ''Haupt- und Stadtkirche St. Johannis'', was consecrated. There were later further fires in L\u00f6\u00dfnitz, whereby the Baroque ''Hospitalkirche'' was destroyed, too.\n\nAfter jurisdiction over the town had been relinquished to the House of Sch\u00f6nburg, the ''F\u00fcrstlich Sch\u00f6nburgische Justizamt Stein'' (\u201cPrincely Sch\u00f6nburg Justice Office of Stein\u201d) came into being in 1861, and that same year, the new ''Hospitalkirche'' was consecrated. When the Sch\u00f6nburg principalities were taken over by the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] in 1878, L\u00f6\u00dfnitz was given a Kingdom of Saxony ''[[Amt (administrative division)|Amt]]'' court, which persisted until 1931.\n\nIn 1917, the bells at both the ''St. Johanniskirche'' and the ''Hospitalkirche'' were removed for war requirements, but only three years later, the former acquired three new bells. In 1939, a [[carillon]] consisting of 23 [[bronze]] bells was installed in the church's spire.\n\nOn 20 April 1945, the town's deputy mayor Rudolf Weber, who wanted to surrender the town to the [[United States|Americans]] without a fight, was shot by the [[Waffen-SS]]. Between 1985 and 1992 there arose on the edge of town a great [[residential area]], where today almost half the town's population lives.\n\nIn 1999 came the amalgamation of the community of Affalter.\n\n=== Population development ===\nThe following population figures refer to 31 December of each given year.\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" \n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" | \n'''1982 to 1988'''\n* 1982 \u2212 8876\n* 1983 \u2212 8780\n* 1984 \u2212 8724\n* 1985 \u2212 8648\n* 1986 \u2212 8500\n* 1987 \u2212 8484\n* 1988 \u2212 10205\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" | \n'''1989 to 1995'''\n* 1989 \u2212 11620\n* 1990 \u2212 12270\n* 1991 \u2212 12951\n* 1992 \u2212 13098\n* 1993 \u2212 13056\n* 1994 \u2212 12801\n* 1995 \u2212 12555\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" | \n'''1996 to 2002'''\n* 1996 \u2212 12302\n* 1997 \u2212 12041\n* 1998 \u2212 11760\n* 1999 \u2212 11527\n* 2000 \u2212 11262\n* 2001 \u2212 11068\n* 2002 \u2212 10769\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" | \n'''2003 to 2006'''\n* 2003 \u2212 10601\n* 2004 \u2212 10479\n* 2005 \u2212 10374\n* 2006 \u2212 10184\n|}\n:<small> Source: ''Statistisches Landesamt des Freistaates Sachsen''</small>\n\n=== Niederl\u00f6\u00dfnitz ===\nToday's constituent community of Niederl\u00f6\u00dfnitz (\u201cLower L\u00f6\u00dfnitz\u201d) was originally a farming village downstream from where the Aubach empties into the L\u00f6\u00dfnitzbach. The first known naming of the community goes back to 1497, when it was known as ''Niderlesenitzs''. About 100 years later, the community counted 6 landowners. One estate was exempted from combat duty and served as the lordly hunting lodge. A. Schuhmann mentioned in 1820 in his ''Lexikon'' two flour mills and a paper mill. However, the paper mill, which had supposedly once been a hammerworks and a coin blank works, burnt down in 1808 and was never rebuilt. Towards the end of the 19th century, the [[railway]] line between [[Zw\u00f6nitz]] and Aue, on which the lower railway station was built somewhat later, came into service. After the station was built came residential areas and industrial development, leading eventually to Niederl\u00f6\u00dfnitz's amalgamation with the Town of L\u00f6\u00dfnitz in 1898.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nL\u00f6\u00dfnitz's arms show a black [[saltire|Saint Andrew's cross]] (the arms of the Castle Counts at Mei\u00dfen, the town's founders) on a yellow background. The cross is surrounded by three towers set on a stylized wall on a red background. The wall and towers refer to the town's former formidable fortifications; the three towers symbolize the three former town gates.\n\n=== Town partnership ===\nSince 1991 there has been a partnership with the Westphalian town of [[Borgholzhausen]].\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n=== Buildings ===\n[[File:Johanniskirche L\u00f6\u00dfnitz.jpg|thumb|St.Johanniskirche]]\n* Old Town\n* Parts of the former town wall (\u201cR\u00f6sselturm\u201d) \n* Town Hall from 1601\n* ''St. Johanniskirche'' with [[carillon]].

Regional municipalities were formed in highly populated areas where it was considered more efficient to provide certain services, such as water, emergency services, and waste management over an area encompassing more than one local municipality. For this reason, regions may be involved in providing services to residents and businesses.\n\nRegional municipalities, where they include smaller municipalities within their boundaries, are sometimes referred to as \"upper-tier\" municipalities. Regional municipalities generally have more servicing responsibilities than counties. Typical services include maintenance and construction of arterial roads (including in urban areas, where counties do not), transit, policing, sewer and water systems, waste disposal, region-wide [[land-use planning]] and development and health and social services. \n\nRegions are typically more urbanized than counties. Regional municipalities are usually implemented in census divisions where an interconnected cluster of urban centres forms the majority of the division's area and population.\n\n== Alberta ==\n[[Alberta]] does not have an official municipal status type of ''regional municipality''.<ref name=2010MuniCodes>{{cite web |url= http://www.municipalaffairs.alberta.ca/documents/msb/2010code.pdf |author=Alberta Municipal Affairs |authorlink=Alberta Municipal Affairs |title=2010 Municipal Codes |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref> However, that has not prevented one municipality from branding itself as one.

Unlike other Canadian regional municipalities it is near-entirely wilderness and has only one \"urban\" centre, the former Town of [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]].

In the NRRM the government of the former Fort Nelson and the regional municipality are merged.  Like regional districts, the regional municipality does not include Indian Reserves or their governments.\n\n== Nova Scotia ==\nIn [[Nova Scotia]], regional municipalities are a single level of government, and provide all municipal services to their communities. As they include both [[urban area|urban centre]]s and [[rural]] areas, they are not called cities, towns or villages. Such municipalities in Nova Scotia take over the area and name of a county.  Counties still exist as a geographic division but may contain a single municipality or may be divided into municipal districts within them.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n== Ontario ==\n{{main|List of municipalities in Ontario}}\nIn [[Ontario]], regional municipalities were created to provide common services to mixed urban and rural municipalities in the way that counties typically provide common services to fully rural municipalities (this paradoxically gives many of the largest urban areas in the province a subtle rural character, such as the presence of numbered [[List of county roads in Ontario|\"county\" roads]] with rural-type signage within them). Only certain predominantly urban divisions are given the status of a regional municipality in Ontario; most census divisions instead retain the status of a county or a district.\n\nThe specific relationship of a regional government and the cities, towns, townships and villages within its borders is determined by provincial legislation; typically the regional municipality provides many core [[Public services|service]]s such as [[police]] protection, [[waste management]] and (in some RMs) [[public transit]]. Similar to counties, they also provide infrastructure for [[List of county roads in Ontario|major roads]], [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, and [[bridge]]s and also handle [[social services]]. Organization of regional government has occasionally been controversial, as council membership is sometimes determined by the constituent municipalities rather than elected directly.\n\nThe province's first regional municipality, the [[Metropolitan Toronto|Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto]], was created in 1954. It was the only regional municipality in the province until the [[Regional Municipality of Ottawa\u2013Carleton]] was created in 1969. Between 1970 and 1974, several more regional municipalities were created by the government of [[Bill Davis]]. \n\nThe later government of [[Mike Harris]] subsequently dissolved four regional municipalities into amalgamated single-tier cities. In 1998, the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto became the amalgamated [[Toronto|City of Toronto]], and in 2001, three other regional municipalities\u2014[[Ottawa|Ottawa\u2013Carleton]], [[Regional Municipality of Hamilton\u2013Wentworth|Hamilton\u2013Wentworth]] and [[Regional Municipality of Sudbury|Sudbury]]\u2014were similarly amalgamated into the single-tier cities of [[Ottawa]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Greater Sudbury]]. \n\nThe Harris government also split the former [[Regional Municipality of Haldimand\u2013Norfolk]] into two separate single-tier municipalities\u2014the Town of Haldimand and the Town of Norfolk, which immediately changed their names to [[Haldimand County, Ontario|Haldimand County]] and [[Norfolk County, Ontario|Norfolk County]].\n\nIn January 2019, the provincial government announced a review of the eight regional municipalities in the province ([[Regional Municipality of Durham|Durham]], [[Regional Municipality of Halton|Halton]], [[District Municipality of Muskoka|Muskoka]], [[Regional Municipality of Niagara|Niagara]], [[Oxford County, Ontario|Oxford]], [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel]], [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Waterloo]], and [[Regional Municipality of York|York]]) and [[Simcoe County]], as well as their constituent lower-tier municipalities.<ref name=\"review\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/01/15/special-advisers-named-to-review-ontario-regional-municipalities-called-honest-thorough-fair.html|title=Special advisers named to review Ontario regional municipalities called \u2018honest, thorough, fair\u2019|last=Kopun|first=Francince|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=15 January 2019|accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref> The review will be headed by special advisers \nKen Seiling and Michael Fenn, who will conduct consultations with politicians, civil servants, business owners, and residents of the nine affected municipalities.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-regional-government-review-1.4978949|title=Ontario reviewing regional governments, raising prospect of future amalgamations|last=Boisvert|first=Nick Boisvert|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=15 January 2019|accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Quebec ==\nIn [[Quebec]], ''[[Regional county municipality|regional county municipalities]]'' or ''RCMs'' ([[French language|French]], ''municipalit\u00e9s r\u00e9gionales de comt\u00e9, MRC'') have constituted the \"county\" level of government for the entire province since the early 1980s.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[History of cities in Canada]]\n*[[Origins of names of cities in Canada]]\n*[[List of cities and towns of Upper Canada]]\n*[[List of city nicknames in Canada]]\n*[[List of cities in North America]]\n*[[List of the 100 largest cities and towns in Canada by area]]\n*[[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population]]\n*[[List of the 100 largest urban areas in Canada by population]]\n*[[List of metropolitan areas in Canada]]\n*[[List of largest Canadian cities by census]]\n*[[Population of Canada by province and territory]]\n*[[Population of Canada by year]]\n*[[List of cities in Canada]]\n*[[List of towns in Canada]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Terms for types of country subdivisions}}\n\n[[Category:Census divisions of Canada]]\n[[Category:Subdivisions of Canada]]\n[[Category:Local government in Canada]]\n[[Category:Municipalities]]\n[[Category:Types of country subdivisions]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the type of Canadian government|the general concept|Local government}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2011}}\n\nA '''regional municipality''' (or '''region''') is a type of [[Municipal government in Canada|Canadian municipal government]] similar to and at the same municipal government level as a [[county]], although the specific structure and servicing responsibilities may vary from place to place.
