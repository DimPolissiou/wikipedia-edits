Among the erroneous myths generated by this campaign were accounts of [[Polish cavalry]] charging German tanks, which did not, in fact, take place. In the east, the [[Red Army]] took the other half of the country in accordance with the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]]. Following the country's fall, Polish soldiers began regrouping in what was to become the [[Polish Army in France (1939\u20131940)|Polish Army in France]]. Both the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]] and the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East]], as well as interior (partisan) forces, primarily represented by the [[Home Army]] (AK) had land forces during the [[Second World War]]. While the forces fighting under the Allied banner were supported by the Polish Air Force and Navy, the partisan forces were an exclusive land formation.\n\nHowever the army operational today has its roots in the surrogate force formed in support of Soviet interests during the establishment of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] after the [[Second World War]]. Two Polish armies, the [[First Polish Army (1944\u20131945)|First Army (Poland)]] and the [[Second Army (Poland)|Second Army]] fought with the [[Red Army]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], supported by some Polish Air Force elements. The formation of a Third Army was begun but not completed.\n\n===1945\u20131989===\n\n[[File:Marking Polish-German Border in 1945.jpg|thumb|250px|Polish People's Army soldiers marking the new [[Oder\u2013Neisse line|Polish-German]] border on the [[Oder River]] in 1945]]\n{{see also|Polish People's Army order of battle}}\nThe end of the war found the Polish Army in the midst of intense organisational development. Although the implementation of the [[Polish Front]] concept was abandoned, new tactical unit and troop types were created. As a result of mobilisation, troop numbers in May 1945 reached 370,000 soldiers, while in September 1945 440,000. [[Military district]]s were organised in liberated areas. The districts exercised direct authority over the units stationed on the territory administered by them. Returning to the country, the [[Second Army (Poland)|Second Army]] was tasked with the protection of the western border of the state from [[Jelenia Gora]] to Kamien Pomorski, and on the basis of its headquarters, the staff of the [[Poznan Military District]] was created at Pozna\u0144. The southern border, from Jelenia Gora to the U\u017cok railway station (at the junction of the Polish, the Soviet and the Czechoslovak borders) was occupied by the [[First Polish Army (1944\u20131945)|First Army]]. Its headquarters staff formed the basis of the [[Silesian Military District]].\n\nIn mid-1945, after the end of [[World War II]], the Polish Army, as part of the overall armed forces, the [[People's Army of Poland]], was divided into six (later seven) districts. These were the Warsaw Military District, HQ in Warsaw, the Lublin Military District, HQ in Lublin, the Krak\u00f3w Military District, HQ in Krak\u00f3w, the Lodz Military District, HQ in Lodz, the Poznan Military District, HQ in Poznan, the Pomeranian Military District, HQ in Torun (formed from the staff of the short-lived LWP 1st Army Corps) and the Silesian Military District, HQ in Katowice, created in the fall of 1945.\n\nIn June 1945 the 1st, [[3rd Infantry Division (Poland)|3rd]] and 8th Infantry Divisions were assigned internal security duties, while the [[4th Infantry Division (Poland)|4th Infantry Division]] was reorganised for the purpose of creating the [[Internal Security Corps]] (KBW). The rule was that military units were used primarily against the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA), while the [[Internal Security Corps]] was used to fight the armed underground independence. Often however army units fought the underground resistance, and ''vice versa''. The culmination of the UPA suppression operation was the so-called 'Wis\u0142a Action' ([[Operation Vistula]]) which took place in 1947. At the same time [[demobilisation]] took place, moving the armed forces to a peace-time footing. On 10 August 1945 a \"decree of the partial demobilisation\" of the armed forces was issued. The next demobilisation phase took place in February and December 1946.\n\n[[File:\u017bo\u0142nierz lwp z swd.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Polish soldier aiming an SVD sniper rifle]]\n\nOne of the most important tasks facing the army after the war was national mine clearance. Between 1944 and 1956 the demining operation involved 44 engineering units or about 19,000 sappers. They cleared mines and other munitions in a clearance area of more than 250,000 square kilometers (80% of the country). 14.75&nbsp;million munitions of various types and 59 million bullets, bombs and other ammunition were found and removed. The mining operations cost the lives of 646 sappers.\n\nIn 1949 the military districts were reduced to four. They were the [[Pomeranian Military District]], HQ in Bydgoszcz, the [[Silesian Military District]], HQ in Wroclaw, the [[Warsaw Military District]], HQ in [[Warsaw]], and the Krak\u00f3w Military District with its headquarters in Krak\u00f3w. In November 1953, the Krak\u00f3w Military District was dissolved and until 1992, Poland was divided into three Districts.\n\nFollowing victory and the movement of Polish borders these troops and other Polish soldiers thought loyal to their Soviet overlords were built up into a force which was to form part of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Polish Army troops would have formed part of the second strategic echelon deployed for an attack on [[NATO]]'s [[Allied Forces Central Europe]]. A [[Polish Front]] headquarters was formed in 1958, along with three armies formed from 1955, the First Polish Army, the Second Army, and the Fourth Army, mobilisation-only headquarters that were to be formed within the three districts.<ref>Andrew A. Michta, 'Red Eagle: the army in Polish politics 1944\u20131988,' Hoover Press, 1990, p.54. Michta says that in 1958, Poland's deputy defence minister, General Duszynski, suggested that the Inspectorate of Training become the nucleus of a 'Polish Front.' According to the plan, in wartime, fifteen Polish divisions would operate in three armies as a 'Front' under a Polish commander. According to one source, the Soviets accepted the proposal and allowed the Inspectorate of Training to become the skeleton for the front. The notion of the front was modified in the mid 1960s and General Duszynski was dismissed in 1964. See also Michta, 1990, p.56.</ref> The Polish Front headquarters was eventually deactivated in 1990, and the three army mobilisation scheme was likewise abandoned.\n\nPolish land forces during the communist era also included troops dedicated to internal security \u2013 the [[Territorial Defense Forces (Poland)|Territorial Defence Forces]] \u2013 and control of the country's borders.<ref>Glenn E. Curtis (ed.), ''Poland : a country study'', p. 267, Washington: GPO, 1994</ref>\n\nUntil the [[fall of communism]] the army's prestige continued to fall, as it was used by the communist government to violently suppress several outbursts of protest, including the [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]], the [[Polish 1970 protests]], and protests during [[Martial law in Poland]] in 1981\u20131982. Troops of the [[Silesian Military District]] also took part in the suppressing of the 1968 democratisation process of Czechoslovakia, commonly known as the [[Prague Spring]].\n\nIn 1989 the Pomeranian Military District controlled the 8th, 12th, 15th, 16th, and 20th Divisions, the Silesian Military District controlled the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 10th, and 11th Divisions, and the [[Warsaw Military District]] the 1st, 3rd, and 9th Divisions, plus the 6th Airborne Division earmarked for Front control.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orbat.com/site/history/historical/poland/army1989.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303072032/http://www.orbat.com/site/history/historical/poland/army1989.html |archive-date=3 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nThe 7th Sea Landing Division was based within the Pomeranian Military District but probably earmarked for Front control.\nThe two districts facing Germany each controlled four divisions in 1990, which had been recently reorganised, in line with the late 1990s Soviet defensive doctrine, from a 3:1 mix of motor rifle : tank regiments into a 2:2 mix of motor rifle and tank regiments.<ref>Chris Westhorp, 'The World's Armies,' Salamander Books, 1991, p.92 {{ISBN|0-517-05240-7}}.

They currently contain some 77,000<ref name=\"auto\"/> active personnel and form many components of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]] deployments around the world. Poland's recorded military history stretches back a [[millennium]] \u2013 since the 10th century (see [[List of Polish wars]] and [[History of the Polish Army]]), but Poland's modern army was formed after the country [[Partitions of Poland|regained independence]] following [[World War I]] in 1918.\n\n==History==\n\n===1918\u20131938===\n{{see also|Polish\u2013Soviet War Polish order of battle}}\nWhen Poland regained independence in 1918, it recreated its military which participated in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1919\u20131921, and in the two smaller conflicts ( [[Polish\u2013Ukrainian War]] (1918\u20131919) and the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian War]] (1920)).\n\nInitially, right after the [[First World War]], Poland had five military districts (1918\u20131921):\n* [[Pozna\u0144 Military District]] (Pozna\u0144ski Okr\u0119g Wojskowy), HQ in [[Pozna\u0144]]\n* [[Krak\u00f3w Military District]] (Krakowski Okr\u0119g Wojskowy), HQ in [[Krak\u00f3w]]\n* [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Military District]] (\u0141\u00f3dzki Okr\u0119g Wojskowy), HQ in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]\n* [[Warsaw Military District]] (Warszawski Okr\u0119g Wojskowy), HQ in [[Warsaw]]\n* [[Lublin Military District]] (Lubelski Okr\u0119g Wojskowy), HQ in [[Lublin]].\n\nThe Polish land forces as readied for the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] was made up of soldiers who had formerly served in the various partitioning empires, supported by some international volunteers.<ref name=\"KoscSq\">[[Janusz Cisek]], ''Kosciuszko, We Are Here: American Pilots of the Kosciuszko Squadron in Defense of Poland, 1919\u20131921'', McFarland & Company, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-1240-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=0786412402&btnG=Search+Books&as_brr=0 Google Print] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024181858/http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=0786412402&btnG=Search+Books&as_brr=0 |date=24 October 2012 }}</ref> There appear to have been a total of around 30 Polish divisions involved. [[Boris Savinkov]] was at the head of an army of 20,000 to 30,000 largely Russian POWs, and was accompanied by [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]] and [[Zinaida Gippius]]. The Polish forces grew from approximately 100,000 in 1918 to over 500,000 in early 1920.<ref>{{Cite book |url= |last=Davies |first=Norman Richard |authorlink=Norman_Davies |title=White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919\u201320 |title-link=White Eagle, Red Star |edition=New |publisher=[[Pimlico (publishing imprint)|Pimlico]] / Random House Inc. |year=2003 |origyear=1972 |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-7126-0694-3 |ref= harv |postscript= {{inconsistent citations}}}}, p83</ref> In August 1920, the Polish army had reached a total strength of 737,767 people; half of that was on the frontline.

Among the erroneous myths generated by this campaign were accounts of [[Polish cavalry]] charging German tanks, which did not, in fact, take place. In the east, the [[Red Army]] took the other half of the country in accordance with the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]]. Following the country's fall, Polish soldiers began regrouping in what was to become the [[Polish Army in France (1939\u20131940)|Polish Army in France]]. Both the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]] and the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East]], as well as interior (partisan) forces, primarily represented by the [[Home Army]] (AK) had land forces during the [[Second World War]]. While the forces fighting under the Allied banner were supported by the Polish Air Force and Navy, the partisan forces were an exclusive land formation.\n\nHowever the army operational today has its roots in the surrogate force formed in support of Soviet interests during the establishment of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] after the [[Second World War]]. Two Polish armies, the [[First Polish Army (1944\u20131945)|First Army (Poland)]] and the [[Second Army (Poland)|Second Army]] fought with the [[Red Army]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], supported by some Polish Air Force elements. The formation of a Third Army was begun but not completed.\n\n===1945\u20131989===\n\n[[File:Marking Polish-German Border in 1945.jpg|thumb|250px|Polish People's Army soldiers marking the new [[Oder\u2013Neisse line|Polish-German]] border on the [[Oder River]] in 1945]]\n{{see also|Polish People's Army order of battle}}\nThe end of the war found the Polish Army in the midst of intense organisational development. Although the implementation of the [[Polish Front]] concept was abandoned, new tactical unit and troop types were created. As a result of mobilisation, troop numbers in May 1945 reached 370,000 soldiers, while in September 1945 440,000. [[Military district]]s were organised in liberated areas. The districts exercised direct authority over the units stationed on the territory administered by them. Returning to the country, the [[Second Army (Poland)|Second Army]] was tasked with the protection of the western border of the state from [[Jelenia Gora]] to Kamien Pomorski, and on the basis of its headquarters, the staff of the [[Poznan Military District]] was created at Pozna\u0144. The southern border, from Jelenia Gora to the U\u017cok railway station (at the junction of the Polish, the Soviet and the Czechoslovak borders) was occupied by the [[First Polish Army (1944\u20131945)|First Army]]. Its headquarters staff formed the basis of the [[Silesian Military District]].\n\nIn mid-1945, after the end of [[World War II]], the Polish Army, as part of the overall armed forces, the [[People's Army of Poland]], was divided into six (later seven) districts. These were the Warsaw Military District, HQ in Warsaw, the Lublin Military District, HQ in Lublin, the Krak\u00f3w Military District, HQ in Krak\u00f3w, the Lodz Military District, HQ in Lodz, the Poznan Military District, HQ in Poznan, the Pomeranian Military District, HQ in Torun (formed from the staff of the short-lived LWP 1st Army Corps) and the Silesian Military District, HQ in Katowice, created in the fall of 1945.\n\nIn June 1945 the 1st, [[3rd Infantry Division (Poland)|3rd]] and 8th Infantry Divisions were assigned internal security duties, while the [[4th Infantry Division (Poland)|4th Infantry Division]] was reorganised for the purpose of creating the [[Internal Security Corps]] (KBW). The rule was that military units were used primarily against the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA), while the [[Internal Security Corps]] was used to fight the armed underground independence. Often however army units fought the underground resistance, and ''vice versa''. The culmination of the UPA suppression operation was the so-called 'Wis\u0142a Action' ([[Operation Vistula]]) which took place in 1947. At the same time [[demobilisation]] took place, moving the armed forces to a peace-time footing. On 10 August 1945 a \"decree of the partial demobilisation\" of the armed forces was issued. The next demobilisation phase took place in February and December 1946.\n\n[[File:\u017bo\u0142nierz lwp z swd.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Polish soldier aiming an SVD sniper rifle]]\n\nOne of the most important tasks facing the army after the war was national mine clearance. Between 1944 and 1956 the demining operation involved 44 engineering units or about 19,000 sappers. They cleared mines and other munitions in a clearance area of more than 250,000 square kilometers (80% of the country). 14.75&nbsp;million munitions of various types and 59 million bullets, bombs and other ammunition were found and removed. The mining operations cost the lives of 646 sappers.\n\nIn 1949 the military districts were reduced to four. They were the [[Pomeranian Military District]], HQ in Bydgoszcz, the [[Silesian Military District]], HQ in Wroclaw, the [[Warsaw Military District]], HQ in [[Warsaw]], and the Krak\u00f3w Military District with its headquarters in Krak\u00f3w. In November 1953, the Krak\u00f3w Military District was dissolved and until 1992, Poland was divided into three Districts.\n\nFollowing victory and the movement of Polish borders these troops and other Polish soldiers thought loyal to their Soviet overlords were built up into a force which was to form part of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Polish Army troops would have formed part of the second strategic echelon deployed for an attack on [[NATO]]'s [[Allied Forces Central Europe]]. A [[Polish Front]] headquarters was formed in 1958, along with three armies formed from 1955, the First Polish Army, the Second Army, and the Fourth Army, mobilisation-only headquarters that were to be formed within the three districts.<ref>Andrew A. Michta, 'Red Eagle: the army in Polish politics 1944\u20131988,' Hoover Press, 1990, p.54. Michta says that in 1958, Poland's deputy defence minister, General Duszynski, suggested that the Inspectorate of Training become the nucleus of a 'Polish Front.' According to the plan, in wartime, fifteen Polish divisions would operate in three armies as a 'Front' under a Polish commander. According to one source, the Soviets accepted the proposal and allowed the Inspectorate of Training to become the skeleton for the front. The notion of the front was modified in the mid 1960s and General Duszynski was dismissed in 1964. See also Michta, 1990, p.56.</ref> The Polish Front headquarters was eventually deactivated in 1990, and the three army mobilisation scheme was likewise abandoned.\n\nPolish land forces during the communist era also included troops dedicated to internal security \u2013 the [[Territorial Defense Forces (Poland)|Territorial Defence Forces]] \u2013 and control of the country's borders.<ref>Glenn E. Curtis (ed.), ''Poland : a country study'', p. 267, Washington: GPO, 1994</ref>\n\nUntil the [[fall of communism]] the army's prestige continued to fall, as it was used by the communist government to violently suppress several outbursts of protest, including the [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]], the [[Polish 1970 protests]], and protests during [[Martial law in Poland]] in 1981\u20131982. Troops of the [[Silesian Military District]] also took part in the suppressing of the 1968 democratisation process of Czechoslovakia, commonly known as the [[Prague Spring]].\n\nIn 1989 the Pomeranian Military District controlled the 8th, 12th, 15th, 16th, and 20th Divisions, the Silesian Military District controlled the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 10th, and 11th Divisions, and the [[Warsaw Military District]] the 1st, 3rd, and 9th Divisions, plus the 6th Airborne Division earmarked for Front control.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orbat.com/site/history/historical/poland/army1989.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303072032/http://www.orbat.com/site/history/historical/poland/army1989.html |archive-date=3 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nThe 7th Sea Landing Division was based within the Pomeranian Military District but probably earmarked for Front control.\nThe two districts facing Germany each controlled four divisions in 1990, which had been recently reorganised, in line with the late 1990s Soviet defensive doctrine, from a 3:1 mix of motor rifle : tank regiments into a 2:2 mix of motor rifle and tank regiments.<ref>Chris Westhorp, 'The World's Armies,' Salamander Books, 1991, p.92 {{ISBN|0-517-05240-7}}. See also Jane's Soviet Intelligence Review for March 1990.</ref> The [[Warsaw Military District]] in the east controlled only the [[1st Mechanised Division (Poland)|1st Mechanised Division]]. Two other mechanised divisions in that district had been disbanded in 1988. There was also the 6th Airborne Division and the [[7th Coastal Defense Brigade|7th Sea Landing Division]], possibly intended to form part of a [[Warsaw Pact]] attack on [[Denmark]], to open the Baltic straits to the North Sea and beyond.

It was written and produced by Jackson, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]. The track was sent to [[contemporary hit radio]] in the US on May 23, 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked to several radio stations. It is an upbeat [[electropop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song with a syncopated drum loop and [[bassline]].

It was Jackson's 19th single to be certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), making her only the third singer, after [[Madonna]] and [[Whitney Houston]], to achieve this feat. The song peaked at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming Jackson's 15th single to reach the top 10 in the UK.

To promote the single, Jackson performed it on British television program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and at the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]].

During this scene, the AIBO and various objects in her room are shown, including a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window.

It was written and produced by Jackson, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]. The track was sent to [[contemporary hit radio]] in the US on May 23, 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked to several radio stations. It is an upbeat [[electropop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song with a syncopated drum loop and [[bassline]]. Based on a previously discarded poem Jackson wrote, the lyrics are about her film character's love for [[The Nutty Professor (character)|The Nutty Professor]].\n\nThe track received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its upbeat sound and Jackson's [[breathy voice]]. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three consecutive weeks, becoming Jackson's ninth US chart-topper. It was Jackson's 19th single to be certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), making her only the third singer, after [[Madonna]] and [[Whitney Houston]], to achieve this feat. The song peaked at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming Jackson's 15th single to reach the top 10 in the UK. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain.\n\nThe [[Joseph Kahn]]-directed music video resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture and features an [[AIBO]] and a prototype of the [[Acura CL]]-X. It features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a tilting platform. Production of the video costed over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), making it one of the [[list of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos of all time]]. To promote the single, Jackson performed it on British television program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and at the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The song was also performed during four of the singer's concert tours, and her 2019 Las Vegas residency, [[Janet Jackson: Metamorphosis]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Action Jackson|magazine=[[USA Weekend]]|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9cDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Janet at the Crossroads|last=Norment|first=Lynn|magazine=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|volume=41|number=1|page=181|date=November 2000|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

It then pans from a panoramic nighttime city view to a scene of Jackson singing from her bed in a confined apartment. During this scene, the AIBO and various objects in her room are shown, including a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto her bed and the AIBO resting in front of her.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

The manuscript is submitted by Neil Adam Armon to another author named Naomi, approximately five thousand years after the power emerges and revolution reassembles the world into a matriarchy. This historical fiction chronicles the experiences of Allie, Roxy, Margot, Jocelyn, and Tunde, as they navigate their rapidly changing world.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a matriarchal society, a gushing male writer writes to an influential author about his fictional account of how the matriarchy came to be. 5,000 years earlier (in our current time), men dominated society. Then, stories emerge of women who can protect themselves with an electrical power. And more than protection, they can attack, torture, even kill.\n\nRoxy is an English teenager whose mother is attacked. She manages to defend herself, injuring one attacker but the other beats her up and kills her mother. Tunde is an aspiring journalist in Nigeria who is attracted to Enuma. Before he can initiate, she zaps him and then kisses him while he is paralyzed. He starts to film women using their emerging power and publishing it online. Margo is a mayor in Wisconsin who discovers her daughter Jocelyn is also developing these powers. Allie is a foster girl who is attacked by her foster father and kills him with her powers before taking refuge in a convent.\n\nAs the powers emerge across the world, Tunde's reputation allows him unique access to document the turmoil in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. Allie discovers how to use her powers to heal and becomes an influential religious leader, propagating a matriarchal doctrine. Margot develops training camps for the women to use their powers. As women in Moldovia start paramilitary groups, Tatiana, the wife of the president of Moldovia steps in to take over the country. Awadi-Atif develops a rebel army to oppose her. Tunde almost gets raped in India. Margot becomes Governor by using her powers to silence her male counterpart during a debate. A drug called glitter enhances the power of women's skeins, which are the organs responsible for their electrical powers. UrbanDox gains influence as an anti-woman activist. Roxy takes over her father's criminal enterprise. Tatiana begins to behave erratically, leading mass killings of men.\n\nAllie kills Tatiana and decides to take the world back to the stone age to reset its growth and structures based on women's powers.\n\nThe influential author responds to the young male writer telling him it is a worthy book but that he should publish it under a woman's name.\n\n==Main characters==\n*'''Allie Montgomery-Taylor''' is a young girl who uses her power to kill her abusive [[fosterage|foster]] father.  She retreats to a [[convent]] where she becomes a religious figure named Mother Eve.\n*'''Roxy Monke''' is the young daughter of a London [[boss (crime)|mob boss]] and is a witness to her mother's murder.  She meets with Mother Eve at the convent to seek help in strengthening her powers and ends up becoming Mother Eve's confidante.\n*'''Margot Cleary''' is an American politician and advocate for training young girls on how to properly use their power.  She creates the North Star Girls Camps across the country as part of her advocacy.\n* '''Jocelyn Cleary''' is the daughter of Margot Cleary and experiences power fluctuations.  Despite her difficulties, Jocelyn is able to awaken her mother's power.\n*'''Olatunde Edo (known as Tunde Edo)''' is a journalist who documents the growing power of women across the globe.  He first gains recognition by posting one of the first videos of women using their power online.\n*'''Tatiana Moskalev''' is the former [[first lady]] of Moldova.  After killing her husband, she takes over the role of president and reconstitutes Moldova as a matriarchal country called Bessapara.\n*'''Neil Adam Armon''' is the fictional author of ''The Power'' and a member of The Men's Writers Association.  Neil reaches out to Naomi through letters to discuss her thoughts on his book. (The name is an anagram of Naomi Alderman).\n\n==Development history==\n''The Power'' is Alderman's fourth novel and was influenced by her relationship with Canadian novelist [[Margaret Atwood]]. The mentorship was arranged through the Rolex mentorship program. In an interview with ''The Telegraph'' in 2012, Alderman explained the influence of Atwood's work on her as a novelist before the mentorship as, \"I\u2019d been to an Orthodox Jewish primary school where every morning the boys said, \u2018Thank you God for not making me a woman.\u2019 If you put that together with ''The Handmaid's Tale'' in your head, something will eventually go fizz!
