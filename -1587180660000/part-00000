It is located in the city of Semarang, Central Java and under the auspices of the Sandjojo Foundation which is affiliated with Archdiocese of Semarang. The university is a continuation of the Indonesian Catholic University of Atmajaya Semarang Branch, which was born in 1964 and later changed its name into the Semarang Catholic Institute of Technology (I.T.K.S.) in 1973. On August 5, 1982 with the Decree of the Minister of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia dated September 24, 1983 Number 0400/0/1983, I.T.K.S. changed its name into Soegijapranata Catholic University.\n\nSoegijapanata Catholic University is one of the best private universities in Indonesia that upholds the motto: \"Talent Pro Patria et Humanitate\" (the best talent is dedicated to the nation-state and humanity). The university has an extensive overseas and domestic cooperation network.\n\n==History==\nAt its inception, '''Soegijapranata Catholic University (SCU)''', located on Jl. Pandanaran 100, [[Semarang]] consists of three faculties namely Faculty of Engineering,  Faculty of Law, and Faculty of Economics. In line with the development of the University, since mid-1990s all SCU\u2019s activities have been centered on the Bendan Dhuwur Campus and until now the Bendhan Dhuwur Campus has become the center of the university's academic activities.\n\nThe name \"'''Soegijapranata'''\" is adapted from the name Mgr. Alb. [[Soegijapranata]], SJ, a priest and the first native Archbishop who became Indonesia\u2019s national hero and figure. '''Soegijapranata''' was born in [[Surakarta]], November 25, 1896. He entered the [[novices]] of the Society of Jesus in Mariendaal, Grave, the [[Netherlands]] on September 27, 1920. He was ordained as a Priest on August 15, 1931 and as an Archbishop of [[Semarang]] on September 20, 1940. His struggle and attention in the world of education is the legacy of his lecturer, Father [[Frans van Lith]], SJ. One of his efforts to improve education was to help increase the quality of two oldest Catholic universities, [[Parahyangan Catholic University]], [[Bandung]], and [[Sanata Dharma University]], [[Yogyakarta]], that were of equal status with the state universities.

It is located in the city of Semarang, Central Java and under the auspices of the Sandjojo Foundation which is affiliated with Archdiocese of Semarang. The university is a continuation of the Indonesian Catholic University of Atmajaya Semarang Branch, which was born in 1964 and later changed its name into the Semarang Catholic Institute of Technology (I.T.K.S.) in 1973. On August 5, 1982 with the Decree of the Minister of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia dated September 24, 1983 Number 0400/0/1983, I.T.K.S. changed its name into Soegijapranata Catholic University.\n\nSoegijapanata Catholic University is one of the best private universities in Indonesia that upholds the motto: \"Talent Pro Patria et Humanitate\" (the best talent is dedicated to the nation-state and humanity).

Pandanaran 100, [[Semarang]] consists of three faculties namely Faculty of Engineering,  Faculty of Law, and Faculty of Economics. In line with the development of the University, since mid-1990s all SCU\u2019s activities have been centered on the Bendan Dhuwur Campus and until now the Bendhan Dhuwur Campus has become the center of the university's academic activities.\n\nThe name \"'''Soegijapranata'''\" is adapted from the name Mgr. Alb. [[Soegijapranata]], SJ, a priest and the first native Archbishop who became Indonesia\u2019s national hero and figure. '''Soegijapranata''' was born in [[Surakarta]], November 25, 1896.

He was ordained as a Priest on August 15, 1931 and as an Archbishop of [[Semarang]] on September 20, 1940. His struggle and attention in the world of education is the legacy of his lecturer, Father [[Frans van Lith]], SJ.
