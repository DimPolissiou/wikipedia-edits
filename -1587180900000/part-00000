To escape special police surveillance in Sicily, he sailed to the United States and arrived in [[New York City]] at the end of September 1901.

He also spent six months in [[New Orleans]].<ref name=critchley39/>\n\nOn 21 May 1902, Cascio Ferro was arrested in connection with a large counterfeiting operation in [[Hackensack, New Jersey]]. He was arrested at the barbershop of Giuseppe Romano on First Avenue, from which the counterfeit money had been distributed. Cascio Ferro managed to escape conviction&mdash;his alibi was that he worked at a [[paper mill]]&mdash;while the other gang members were tried and sentenced.<ref name=critchley39/>\n\nIn New York, he became associated with the [[Morello crime family|Morello gang]] in [[Harlem]], headed by [[Giuseppe Morello]] and [[Ignazio Lupo]].<ref name=critchley51>Critchley, ''The Origin of Organized Crime in America'', p. 51</ref> In September 1904, he returned to Sicily shortly after police [[New_York_City_Police_Department#Rank_structure|sergeant]] [[Joseph Petrosino]] of the [[New York City Police Department]] ordered his arrest for involvement with the [[Barrel Murder]]; his application for American citizenship was consequently blocked.<ref name=critchley39/> Petrosino traced him to New Orleans, where Cascio Ferro had gone to escape detection, but he had already slipped away.<ref name=nyp191102/>\n\nSome observers consider Cascio Ferro as the one who brought the [[extortion]] practice of \"continuing protection\" in exchange for protection money ([[Pizzo (extortion)|pizzo]]) from Sicily to the United States. \"You have to skim the cream off the milk without breaking the bottle,\" he summarized the system. \"Don't throw people into bankruptcy with ridiculous demands for money.

He was the ''capo elettore'' ([[ward heeler]]) of Domenico De Michele Ferrantelli, the mayor of [[Burgio]] and member of Parliament for the district of [[Bivona]], as well as on good terms with the Baron Inglese.<ref name=lupo146/> He exercised influence over several Mafia ''[[cosca|cosche]]'' (clans) in the towns of Bisacquino, Burgio, [[Campofiorito]], [[Chiusa Sclafani]], [[Contessa Entellina]], Corleone, and [[Villafranca Sicula]], as well as some districts in the city of Palermo.<ref name=servadio57/><ref name=gangrule1>[http://www.gangrule.com/biographies/vito-cascioferro Biography of Vito Cascio Ferro] on GangRule.com (accessed October 16, 2010)</ref>\n\nA semi-factual and romantic portrait by journalist [[Luigi Barzini, Jr.|Luigi Barzini]] contributed much to form the legend of Don Vito:<ref name=servadio57/>\n\n<blockquote>Don Vito brought the organization to its highest perfection without undue recourse to violence. The Mafia leader who scatters corpses all over the island in order to achieve his goal is considered as inept as the statesman who has to wage aggressive wars. Don Vito ruled and inspired fear mainly by the use of his great qualities and natural ascendancy. His awe-inspiring appearance helped him. \u2026 His manners were princely, his demeanour humble but majestic. He was loved by all. Being very generous by nature, he never refused a request for aid and dispensed millions in loans, gifts and general philanthropy. He would personally go out of his way to redress a wrong. When he started a journey, every major, dressed in his best clothes, awaited him at the entrance of his village, kissed his hands, and paid homage, as if he were a king. And he was a king of sorts: under his reign peace and order were observed, the Mafia peace, of course, which was not what the official law of the Kingdom of Italy would have imposed, but people did not stop to draw too fine a distinction.<ref name=barzini291>Barzini, ''The Italians'', p. 291</ref></blockquote>\n\nPolice reports described Cascio Ferro as notoriously associated with the \"high\" Mafia, leading a life of luxury, going to the theater, caf\u00e9s, gambling high sums at the ''Circolo dei Civili''{{snd}} a club for gentlemen, reserved for those with pretensions to education and elite status.<ref name=servadio57/>\n\n==The Petrosino murder==\n[[File:Joe petrosino.jpg|thumb|left|New York City police officer [[Joseph Petrosino]]]]\n\nCascio Ferro is considered to be the mastermind behind the murder of New York policeman and head of the Italian Squad, [[Joseph Petrosino]], on 12 March 1909. He was shot and killed in Piazza Marina in Palermo; two men were seen running from the crime scene. Petrosino had gone to Sicily to gather information from local police files to help deport Italian gangsters from New York as illegal immigrants.<ref name=marino/><ref name=nyp191102/><ref name=critchley68>Critchley, ''The Origin of Organized Crime in America'', pp. 68-69</ref><ref name=dickie209>Dickie, ''Cosa Nostra'', pp. 209-11</ref> The two men were very much aware of the danger to each other's survival; Petrosino carried a note describing Cascio Ferro as \u201ca terrible criminal\u201d, while Cascio Ferro had a photograph of the police officer.<ref name=servadio57/>\n\nMany accounts claim that Cascio Ferro personally killed Petrosino. Legend has it that Cascio Ferro excused himself from a dinner party among the high society at the home of his political patron De Michele Ferrantelli, took a carriage (that of his host according to some), and drove to Piazza Marina in Palermo's city centre. He and Petrosino engaged in a brief conversation, then Cascio Ferro killed Petrosino and returned to join the dinner again.<ref name=nyp191102/><ref>For a romanticized version of Cascio Ferro's life, see [http://gangstersinc.ning.com/profiles/blogs/the-sun-king-of-the-mafia The Sun King of The Mafia] on Gangsters Inc.</ref> Historical reconstructions have dismissed this version and cannot locate Cascio Ferro at the scene of the crime.\n\nNews of the murder spread fast in U.S. newspapers and a swell of anti-Italian sentiment spread across New York.<ref name=gangrule2/> Cascio Ferro pleaded his innocence and provided an alibi for the entire period when Petrosino was assassinated. He stayed in the house of De Michele Ferrantelli in Burgio.<ref name=critchley68/> However, the alibi provided by De Michele Ferrantelli was suspicious, taking into account the relation between the two. Moreover, while in jail after his arrest and life sentence in 1930, Cascio Ferro apparently claimed that he had killed Petrosino. According to writer [[Arrigo Petacco]] in his 1972 book on Joe Petrosino, Cascio Ferro said: \"In my whole life I have killed only one person, and I did that disinterestedly \u2026 Petrosino was a brave adversary, and deserved better than a shameful death at the hands of some hired cut-throat.\"<ref name=arlacchi18>Arlacchi, ''Mafia Business'', p. 18</ref>\n\nA report by Baldassare Ceola, the police commissioner of Palermo, concluded that the crime had probably been carried out by Mafiosi Carlo Costantino and Antonino Passananti under Cascio Ferro's direction.<ref name=gangrule2>[http://www.gangrule.com/events/petrosino-murder-1909 Lt.

Cascio Ferro had been arrested some 69 times before and always had been acquitted, but this time it was different. After hearing the sentence the president of the court asked Cascio Ferro if he had something to say in his defense. Cascio Ferro stood up and said: \"Gentlemen, as you have been unable to obtain proof of any of the numerous crimes I have committed, you have been reduced to condemning me for the only one I never committed.\"<ref name=gangrule1/><ref name=dickie185/><ref name=time151084>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923699,00.html#ixzz1WAofdtIO Blood, Business, Honor], Time Magazine, October 15, 1984</ref> The \"iron prefect\", as Mori was known, wanted to give maximum publicity to the event. He had posters printed with pictures of Cascio Ferro and the text of the court sentence.<ref name=sic270205/>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nThere is uncertainty about the exact date of his death. The most common account is that he died of natural causes in 1945 while serving his sentence at Ucciardone prison in Palermo.<ref name=gangrule1/> Italian author Petacco found evidence for his 1972 book on Joe Petrosino that Cascio Ferro may have died of dehydration in the summer of 1943.

The Mafia leader who scatters corpses all over the island in order to achieve his goal is considered as inept as the statesman who has to wage aggressive wars. Don Vito ruled and inspired fear mainly by the use of his great qualities and natural ascendancy. His awe-inspiring appearance helped him. \u2026 His manners were princely, his demeanour humble but majestic. He was loved by all. Being very generous by nature, he never refused a request for aid and dispensed millions in loans, gifts and general philanthropy. He would personally go out of his way to redress a wrong. When he started a journey, every major, dressed in his best clothes, awaited him at the entrance of his village, kissed his hands, and paid homage, as if he were a king. And he was a king of sorts: under his reign peace and order were observed, the Mafia peace, of course, which was not what the official law of the Kingdom of Italy would have imposed, but people did not stop to draw too fine a distinction.<ref name=barzini291>Barzini, ''The Italians'', p. 291</ref></blockquote>\n\nPolice reports described Cascio Ferro as notoriously associated with the \"high\" Mafia, leading a life of luxury, going to the theater, caf\u00e9s, gambling high sums at the ''Circolo dei Civili''{{snd}} a club for gentlemen, reserved for those with pretensions to education and elite status.<ref name=servadio57/>\n\n==The Petrosino murder==\n[[File:Joe petrosino.jpg|thumb|left|New York City police officer [[Joseph Petrosino]]]]\n\nCascio Ferro is considered to be the mastermind behind the murder of New York policeman and head of the Italian Squad, [[Joseph Petrosino]], on 12 March 1909. He was shot and killed in Piazza Marina in Palermo; two men were seen running from the crime scene. Petrosino had gone to Sicily to gather information from local police files to help deport Italian gangsters from New York as illegal immigrants.<ref name=marino/><ref name=nyp191102/><ref name=critchley68>Critchley, ''The Origin of Organized Crime in America'', pp. 68-69</ref><ref name=dickie209>Dickie, ''Cosa Nostra'', pp. 209-11</ref> The two men were very much aware of the danger to each other's survival; Petrosino carried a note describing Cascio Ferro as \u201ca terrible criminal\u201d, while Cascio Ferro had a photograph of the police officer.<ref name=servadio57/>\n\nMany accounts claim that Cascio Ferro personally killed Petrosino. Legend has it that Cascio Ferro excused himself from a dinner party among the high society at the home of his political patron De Michele Ferrantelli, took a carriage (that of his host according to some), and drove to Piazza Marina in Palermo's city centre. He and Petrosino engaged in a brief conversation, then Cascio Ferro killed Petrosino and returned to join the dinner again.<ref name=nyp191102/><ref>For a romanticized version of Cascio Ferro's life, see [http://gangstersinc.ning.com/profiles/blogs/the-sun-king-of-the-mafia The Sun King of The Mafia] on Gangsters Inc.</ref> Historical reconstructions have dismissed this version and cannot locate Cascio Ferro at the scene of the crime.\n\nNews of the murder spread fast in U.S. newspapers and a swell of anti-Italian sentiment spread across New York.<ref name=gangrule2/> Cascio Ferro pleaded his innocence and provided an alibi for the entire period when Petrosino was assassinated. He stayed in the house of De Michele Ferrantelli in Burgio.<ref name=critchley68/> However, the alibi provided by De Michele Ferrantelli was suspicious, taking into account the relation between the two. Moreover, while in jail after his arrest and life sentence in 1930, Cascio Ferro apparently claimed that he had killed Petrosino. According to writer [[Arrigo Petacco]] in his 1972 book on Joe Petrosino, Cascio Ferro said: \"In my whole life I have killed only one person, and I did that disinterestedly \u2026 Petrosino was a brave adversary, and deserved better than a shameful death at the hands of some hired cut-throat.\"<ref name=arlacchi18>Arlacchi, ''Mafia Business'', p. 18</ref>\n\nA report by Baldassare Ceola, the police commissioner of Palermo, concluded that the crime had probably been carried out by Mafiosi Carlo Costantino and Antonino Passananti under Cascio Ferro's direction.<ref name=gangrule2>[http://www.gangrule.com/events/petrosino-murder-1909 Lt.

After hearing the sentence the president of the court asked Cascio Ferro if he had something to say in his defense.

The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba. After a troubled start, Brazil secured the double gold in [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] after beating the United States once again in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/volleyball/story/_/id/8259676/2012-london-olympics-brazil-shocks-us-women-volleyball-gold|title=Brazil wins women's volleyball gold|work=espn.go.com|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> Japan won the bronze medal after defeating South Korea.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], home team Brazil were favorites to once again win the title, thus equalling Cuba's three consecutive gold medals between 1992 and 2000. After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

women consistently since [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]].\n\n[[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], and the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], are the only teams to win multiple gold medals at the men's tournament since its introduction. The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba. After a troubled start, Brazil secured the double gold in [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] after beating the United States once again in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/volleyball/story/_/id/8259676/2012-london-olympics-brazil-shocks-us-women-volleyball-gold|title=Brazil wins women's volleyball gold|work=espn.go.com|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> Japan won the bronze medal after defeating South Korea.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], home team Brazil were favorites to once again win the title, thus equalling Cuba's three consecutive gold medals between 1992 and 2000. After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

They wove bags, sandals, belts out of yucca plants and leaves - and strung beads.

The simple, gray pottery allowed them a better tool for cooking and storage. Beans were added to the cultivated diet.  Bows and arrows made hunting easier and thus the acquisition of hides for clothing.  Turkey feathers were woven into blankets and robes.  On the rim of Mesa Verde, small groups built pit houses which were built several feet below the surface with elements suggestive of the introduction of celebration rituals.<ref>Wenger, Gilbert R.

Pueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in U, E and L shapes.  The buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration.  Towers were built near kivas and likely used for look-outs. Pottery became more versatile, not just for cooking, but now included pitchers, ladles, bowls, jars and dishware for food and drink. White pottery with black designs emerged, the pigments coming from plants.  Water management and conservation techniques, including the use of reservoirs and silt-retaining dams also emerged during this period.<ref>Wenger, Gilbert R. (1991) [1980].

This dramatically increased access to unique goods, such as Chacoan style pottery, copper bells, macaw remains, sea shells and raw materials used to create artifacts.  In addition to the integration of new goods into their culture, the extensive trade routes also brought new ideas and people to the region.<ref name=CC-PII/>\n* The Chaco culture had a unique architecture, \"great houses\" which were large, multi-storied and multi-room complexes, with great [[kiva]]s located inside the structure.  More than 225 great houses have been found in the northern Anasazi regions, including the Mesa Verde region.  Great houses built outside of Chaco Canyon were called \"outliers,\" connected back to Chaco Canyon through a network of roads.<ref name=CC-PII/>\n\nUntil this time, most of the people lived in disperse communities of small farmsteads, clustered around community centers which included large buildings for meetings and ceremonies and great [[kiva]]s.  There also appeared to have been storage areas for harvested crops.  The Chacoan cultural influence was reflected in \"great houses\" that began appearing in Mesa Verde region communities starting about 1080, and lasting until 1140 after which point great houses were no longer built in Mesa Verde region settlements.

The simple, gray pottery allowed them a better tool for cooking and storage. Beans were added to the cultivated diet.  Bows and arrows made hunting easier and thus the acquisition of hides for clothing.  Turkey feathers were woven into blankets and robes.  On the rim of Mesa Verde, small groups built pit houses which were built several feet below the surface with elements suggestive of the introduction of celebration rituals.<ref>Wenger, Gilbert R.

Pueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in U, E and L shapes.  The buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration.  Towers were built near kivas and likely used for look-outs. Pottery became more versatile, not just for cooking, but now included pitchers, ladles, bowls, jars and dishware for food and drink. White pottery with black designs emerged, the pigments coming from plants.  Water management and conservation techniques, including the use of reservoirs and silt-retaining dams also emerged during this period.<ref>Wenger, Gilbert R. (1991) [1980].

This dramatically increased access to unique goods, such as Chacoan style pottery, copper bells, macaw remains, sea shells and raw materials used to create artifacts.  In addition to the integration of new goods into their culture, the extensive trade routes also brought new ideas and people to the region.<ref name=CC-PII/>\n* The Chaco culture had a unique architecture, \"great houses\" which were large, multi-storied and multi-room complexes, with great [[kiva]]s located inside the structure.  More than 225 great houses have been found in the northern Anasazi regions, including the Mesa Verde region.  Great houses built outside of Chaco Canyon were called \"outliers,\" connected back to Chaco Canyon through a network of roads.<ref name=CC-PII/>\n\nUntil this time, most of the people lived in disperse communities of small farmsteads, clustered around community centers which included large buildings for meetings and ceremonies and great [[kiva]]s.  There also appeared to have been storage areas for harvested crops.  The Chacoan cultural influence was reflected in \"great houses\" that began appearing in Mesa Verde region communities starting about 1080, and lasting until 1140 after which point great houses were no longer built in Mesa Verde region settlements.
