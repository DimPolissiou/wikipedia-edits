Another one is a \"Mouseke-Think-About-It Tool\" represented by a silhouette of Mickey's head with rotating gears, in which characters must think of what to use before telling the Tool \"Mouseke-Think-About-It-Tool, we pick the (object)\". Once the tools have been shown to Mickey on the Mousekedoer screen, they are quickly downloaded to Toodles, a small, Mickey-head-shaped flying extension of the Mousekedoer. By calling \"Oh, Toodles!\" Mickey summons him to pop up from where he is hiding and fly up to the screen so the viewer can pick which tool Mickey needs for the current situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atv.disney.go.com/playhouse/mickeymouseclubhouse/stories/ohtoodles/index.html|title=Oh Toodles!

Another one is a \"Mouseke-Think-About-It Tool\" represented by a silhouette of Mickey's head with rotating gears, in which characters must think of what to use before telling the Tool \"Mouseke-Think-About-It-Tool, we pick the (object)\". Once the tools have been shown to Mickey on the Mousekedoer screen, they are quickly downloaded to Toodles, a small, Mickey-head-shaped flying extension of the Mousekedoer.

At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage [[electric power transmission]] system.\n\nA transmission line is required to bring the generated power to (often remote) markets. For an off-shore station this may require a submarine cable. Construction of a new high-voltage line may be too costly for the wind resource alone, but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for conventionally fueled generation.\n\nOne of the biggest current challenges to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states in the middle of the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">Wald, Matthew (26 August 2008) [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/business/27grid.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 Wind Energy Bumps Into Power Grid\u2019s Limits]. ''New York Times''</ref> As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances.<ref>Power System Analysis and Design.Glover, Sarma, Overbye/ 5th Edition</ref> However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.<ref>[http://www.pressherald.com/news/there-is-a-problem-withwind-power-in-maine_2013-08-04.html?pagenum=full Inadequate transmission lines keeping some Maine wind power off the grid \u2013 The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram].

In the image, wind power [[Wind power in Spain|generators in Spain]], near an [[Osborne bull]].]]\n\nElectric power generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-[[Intermittent power sources#Terminology|dispatchable]] nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental [[operating reserve]], and (at high penetration levels) could require an increase in the already existing [[energy demand management]], [[load shedding]], storage solutions or system interconnection with [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] cables.\n\nFluctuations in load and allowance for failure of large fossil-fuel generating units requires operating reserve capacity, which can be increased to compensate for variability of wind generation.\n\nWind power is variable, and during low wind periods it must be replaced by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of [[intermittent power source]]s such as wind power, is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.\n\nPresently, grid systems with large wind penetration require a small increase in the frequency of usage of [[natural gas]] spinning reserve power plants to prevent a loss of electric power in the event that there is no wind. At low wind power penetration, this is less of an issue.<ref name=\"is windpower reliable\" /><ref name=\"clavertonReliable\" /><ref>Milligan, Michael (October 2010) [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/49019.pdf Operating Reserves and Wind Power Integration: An International Comparison].

Despite the small capacity, it is enough to guarantee that power output complies with forecast for 15 minutes, as the battery is used to eliminate the difference rather than provide full output. In certain cases the increased predictability can be used to take wind power penetration from 20 to 30 or 40 percent. The battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from gas plants.<ref>Bullis, Kevin. \"[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/514331/wind-turbines-battery-included-can-keep-power-supplies-stable/ Wind Turbines, Battery Included, Can Keep Power Supplies Stable]\" [[Technology Review]], 7 May 2013.

As the distance between sites increases, the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites, decreases.{{efn-ua|name=Diesendorf|1={{citation |author=Diesendorf, Mark |year=2007 |title=Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy |page=119 |quote=Graham Sinden analysed over 30 years of hourly wind speed data from 66 sites spread out over the United Kingdom.

During hours of low electrical demand excess [[electrical grid]] power is used to pump water up into the reservoir, which then provides an extra 174 MW of electric power during periods of peak demand.]]\n\nTypically, conventional [[hydroelectricity]] complements wind power very well. When the wind is blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.\n\nAlternatively, where a suitable head of water is not available, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] or other forms of [[grid energy storage]] such as [[compressed air energy storage]] and [[thermal energy storage]] can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level \u2013 low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage \u2013 as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this [[arbitrage]] can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW [[Dinorwig pumped storage plant|Dinorwig pumped-storage plant]] evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.<ref name=\"dinorwig\" /><ref name=\"futureStorage\" />\n\nIn particular geographic regions, peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power. In the U.S. states of [[Wind power in California|California]] and [[Wind power in Texas|Texas]], for example, hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to the use of [[air conditioning]]. Some utilities subsidize the purchase of [[geothermal heat pump]]s by their customers, to reduce electric power demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient;<ref name=\"geothermal_incentive\" /> widespread adoption of this technology would better match electric power demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds. A possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC \"[[super grid]]\".

The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74&nbsp;billion for energy subsidies to support [[R&D]] for [[nuclear power]] ($50 billion) and [[fossil fuels]] ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, [[renewable energy]] technologies and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] received a total of US$26&nbsp;billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help to level the playing field and support growing energy sectors, namely [[solar power]], wind power, and [[biofuels]].<ref name=per /> History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.<ref name=per>Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007).

The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand.\n\nHowever, IEA's views are not universally accepted. Between 2010 and 2016, subsidies for wind were between 1.3\u00a2 and 5.7\u00a2 per kWh. Subsidies for coal, natural gas and nuclear are all between 0.05\u00a2 and 0.2\u00a2 per kWh over all years.

The result of over a millennium of [[windmill]] development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of horizontal axis and [[Vertical axis wind turbine|vertical axis]] types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as [[Battery charger|battery charging]] for auxiliary power. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the [[electrical grid]]. Arrays of large turbines, known as [[wind farm]]s, have become an increasingly important source of [[renewable energy]] and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on [[fossil fuel]]s.\n\nWind turbine design is the process of defining the form and specifications of a [[wind turbine]] to extract energy from the [[wind]].<ref name=\"BERR\">{{cite web | publisher =UK Department for Business, Enterprise & Regulatory Reform | title =Efficiency and performance |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file17821.pdf | accessdate =29 December 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090205054846/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file17821.pdf | archivedate =5 February 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nA wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind's energy, point the turbine into the wind, convert [[mechanical energy|mechanical rotation]] into [[electrical power]], and other systems to start, stop, and control the turbine.\n\nIn 1919 the German physicist [[Albert Betz]] showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine, the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16/27 (59%) of the kinetic energy of the wind to be captured. This [[Betz' law|Betz limit]] can be approached in modern turbine designs, which may reach 70 to 80% of the theoretical Betz limit.<ref>[[Albert Betz|Betz, A.]]; Randall, D. G. (trans.).

The air flow at the blades is not the same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the [[aerodynamics]] of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alternative-energy-news.info/what-factors-affect-the-output-of-wind-turbines/ | title=What factors affect the output of wind turbines? | publisher=Alternative-energy-news.info | date=24 July 2009 | accessdate=6 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the aerodynamic [[Wind turbine design#Blade design|design of the blades]], the design of a complete wind power system must also address the design of the installation's [[Wind turbine design#The hub|rotor hub]], [[Nacelle (wind turbine)|nacelle]], [[Wind turbine design#Tower|tower structure]], [[Electric generator|generator]], controls, and foundation.<ref name=\"univ2011\">{{cite web |author1=Zehnder, Alan T. |author2=Warhaft, Zellman\n |lastauthoramp=yes |title=University Collaboration on Wind Energy |date=27 July 2011 |url=http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/attachments/2011-UnivWindCollaboration.pdf |publisher=Cornell University [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] |accessdate=22 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901005908/http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/attachments/2011-UnivWindCollaboration.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2011 |df=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|float=right|{{Portal|Renewable energy|Energy|Wind power}}}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[100% renewable energy]]\n* [[Airborne wind turbine]]\n* [[Cost of electricity by source]]\n* [[Global Wind Day]]\n* [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources]]\n* [[List of wind turbine manufacturers]]\n* [[Lists of offshore wind farms by country]]\n* [[Lists of wind farms by country]]\n* [[Outline of wind energy]]\n* [[Renewable energy by country]]\n* [[Wind resource assessment]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=home-made>[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Migration/article100906.ece Home-made energy to prop up grid] [[The Times]] 22 June 2008 Retrieved on 10 January 2013</ref>\n\n<ref name=ceereCapInter>[http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf Wind Power: Capacity Factor, Intermittency, and what happens when the wind doesn't blow?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001205145/http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf |date=1 October 2008}}.

At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage [[electric power transmission]] system.\n\nA transmission line is required to bring the generated power to (often remote) markets. For an off-shore station this may require a submarine cable. Construction of a new high-voltage line may be too costly for the wind resource alone, but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for conventionally fueled generation.\n\nOne of the biggest current challenges to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states in the middle of the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">Wald, Matthew (26 August 2008) [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/business/27grid.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 Wind Energy Bumps Into Power Grid\u2019s Limits]. ''New York Times''</ref> As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances.<ref>Power System Analysis and Design.Glover, Sarma, Overbye/ 5th Edition</ref> However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.<ref>[http://www.pressherald.com/news/there-is-a-problem-withwind-power-in-maine_2013-08-04.html?pagenum=full Inadequate transmission lines keeping some Maine wind power off the grid \u2013 The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram].

In the image, wind power [[Wind power in Spain|generators in Spain]], near an [[Osborne bull]].]]\n\nElectric power generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-[[Intermittent power sources#Terminology|dispatchable]] nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental [[operating reserve]], and (at high penetration levels) could require an increase in the already existing [[energy demand management]], [[load shedding]], storage solutions or system interconnection with [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] cables.\n\nFluctuations in load and allowance for failure of large fossil-fuel generating units requires operating reserve capacity, which can be increased to compensate for variability of wind generation.\n\nWind power is variable, and during low wind periods it must be replaced by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of [[intermittent power source]]s such as wind power, is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.\n\nPresently, grid systems with large wind penetration require a small increase in the frequency of usage of [[natural gas]] spinning reserve power plants to prevent a loss of electric power in the event that there is no wind. At low wind power penetration, this is less of an issue.<ref name=\"is windpower reliable\" /><ref name=\"clavertonReliable\" /><ref>Milligan, Michael (October 2010) [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/49019.pdf Operating Reserves and Wind Power Integration: An International Comparison].

Despite the small capacity, it is enough to guarantee that power output complies with forecast for 15 minutes, as the battery is used to eliminate the difference rather than provide full output. In certain cases the increased predictability can be used to take wind power penetration from 20 to 30 or 40 percent. The battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from gas plants.<ref>Bullis, Kevin. \"[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/514331/wind-turbines-battery-included-can-keep-power-supplies-stable/ Wind Turbines, Battery Included, Can Keep Power Supplies Stable]\" [[Technology Review]], 7 May 2013.

During hours of low electrical demand excess [[electrical grid]] power is used to pump water up into the reservoir, which then provides an extra 174 MW of electric power during periods of peak demand.]]\n\nTypically, conventional [[hydroelectricity]] complements wind power very well. When the wind is blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.\n\nAlternatively, where a suitable head of water is not available, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] or other forms of [[grid energy storage]] such as [[compressed air energy storage]] and [[thermal energy storage]] can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level \u2013 low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage \u2013 as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this [[arbitrage]] can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW [[Dinorwig pumped storage plant|Dinorwig pumped-storage plant]] evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.<ref name=\"dinorwig\" /><ref name=\"futureStorage\" />\n\nIn particular geographic regions, peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power. In the U.S. states of [[Wind power in California|California]] and [[Wind power in Texas|Texas]], for example, hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to the use of [[air conditioning]]. Some utilities subsidize the purchase of [[geothermal heat pump]]s by their customers, to reduce electric power demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient;<ref name=\"geothermal_incentive\" /> widespread adoption of this technology would better match electric power demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds. A possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC \"[[super grid]]\". In the U.S. it is estimated that to upgrade the transmission system to take in planned or potential renewables would cost at least USD 60 bn,<ref name=\"slogin\" /> while the society value of added windpower would be more than that cost.<ref name=usvis>\"[https://www.energy.gov/windvision A New Era for Wind Power in the United States]\" p. xiv.

Arrays of large turbines, known as [[wind farm]]s, have become an increasingly important source of [[renewable energy]] and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on [[fossil fuel]]s.\n\nWind turbine design is the process of defining the form and specifications of a [[wind turbine]] to extract energy from the [[wind]].<ref name=\"BERR\">{{cite web | publisher =UK Department for Business, Enterprise & Regulatory Reform | title =Efficiency and performance |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file17821.pdf | accessdate =29 December 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090205054846/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file17821.pdf | archivedate =5 February 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nA wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind's energy, point the turbine into the wind, convert [[mechanical energy|mechanical rotation]] into [[electrical power]], and other systems to start, stop, and control the turbine.\n\nIn 1919 the German physicist [[Albert Betz]] showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine, the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16/27 (59%) of the kinetic energy of the wind to be captured. This [[Betz' law|Betz limit]] can be approached in modern turbine designs, which may reach 70 to 80% of the theoretical Betz limit.<ref>[[Albert Betz|Betz, A.]]; Randall, D. G. (trans.).

The air flow at the blades is not the same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the [[aerodynamics]] of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alternative-energy-news.info/what-factors-affect-the-output-of-wind-turbines/ | title=What factors affect the output of wind turbines? | publisher=Alternative-energy-news.info | date=24 July 2009 | accessdate=6 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the aerodynamic [[Wind turbine design#Blade design|design of the blades]], the design of a complete wind power system must also address the design of the installation's [[Wind turbine design#The hub|rotor hub]], [[Nacelle (wind turbine)|nacelle]], [[Wind turbine design#Tower|tower structure]], [[Electric generator|generator]], controls, and foundation.<ref name=\"univ2011\">{{cite web |author1=Zehnder, Alan T. |author2=Warhaft, Zellman\n |lastauthoramp=yes |title=University Collaboration on Wind Energy |date=27 July 2011 |url=http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/attachments/2011-UnivWindCollaboration.pdf |publisher=Cornell University [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] |accessdate=22 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901005908/http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/attachments/2011-UnivWindCollaboration.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2011 |df=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|float=right|{{Portal|Renewable energy|Energy|Wind power}}}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[100% renewable energy]]\n* [[Airborne wind turbine]]\n* [[Cost of electricity by source]]\n* [[Global Wind Day]]\n* [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources]]\n* [[List of wind turbine manufacturers]]\n* [[Lists of offshore wind farms by country]]\n* [[Lists of wind farms by country]]\n* [[Outline of wind energy]]\n* [[Renewable energy by country]]\n* [[Wind resource assessment]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=home-made>[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Migration/article100906.ece Home-made energy to prop up grid] [[The Times]] 22 June 2008 Retrieved on 10 January 2013</ref>\n\n<ref name=ceereCapInter>[http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf Wind Power: Capacity Factor, Intermittency, and what happens when the wind doesn't blow?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001205145/http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf |date=1 October 2008}}.
