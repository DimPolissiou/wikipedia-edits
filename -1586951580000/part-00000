Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]]. Dae-Wi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms.

These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]].

His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal.

His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability.

Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles.

Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo.

As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms.

Although the [[Nuffield Organization]] was heavily involved in [[World War II|war work]] and a governmental ban existed on civilian car production, Morris Motors' vice chairman, [[Miles Thomas]], wanted to prepare the ground for new products to be launched as soon as the war was over.<ref name=\"issigonis\">{{Cite book| last=Bardsley | first=Gillian | title=Issigonis: The Official Biography | page= | publisher= Icon Books | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-84046-687-4}}</ref>{{rp|115}} Vic Oak, the company's chief engineer, had already brought to Thomas' attention a promising junior engineer, [[Alec Issigonis]], who had been employed at Morris since 1935 and specialised in [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] design,<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|85}} but he had frequently impressed Oak with his advanced ideas about car design in general.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|114}} Issigonis had come to Oak's particular attention with his work on the new [[Morris Ten#Morris Ten series M|Morris Ten]], which was in development during 1936/7. This was the first Morris to use [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unitary construction]] and was conceived with [[Independent suspension|independent front suspension]]. Issigonis designed a coil-sprung wishbone system, which was later dropped on cost grounds. Although the design was later used on the [[MG Y-type]] and many other postwar [[MG Cars|MGs]], the Morris Ten entered production with a front [[beam axle]]. Despite his brief being to focus on the Ten's suspension, Issigonis had also drawn up a [[Rack and pinion#Steering|rack and pinion steering]] system for the car. Like his suspension design, this was not adopted, but resurfaced in the postwar years on the MG Y-type, but these ideas proved that he was the perfect candidate to lead the design work on a new advanced small car.\n\nWith virtually all resources required for the war effort, Thomas nonetheless approved the development of a new small family car that would replace the [[Morris Eight]]. Although Oak (and Morris's technical director, Sidney Smith) were in overall charge of the project, Issigonis  was ultimately responsible for the design, working with only two other [[Drafter|draughtsmen]].<ref name=\"minorbio\">{{Cite book| last=Wainwright | first=Martin | title=Morris Minor: The Biography | page= | publisher= Aurum | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-84513-509-6}}</ref>{{rp|60}} Thomas named the project 'Mosquito' and ensured that it remained as secret as possible,<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|117}} both from the [[Ministry of Supply]] and from company founder William Morris ([[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|Lord Nuffield]]), who was still chairman of Morris Motors, and as widely expected, would not look favourably on Issigonis' radical ideas.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|63}}\n\nIssigonis' overall concept was to produce a practical, economical, and affordable car for the general public that would equal, if not surpass, the convenience and design quality of a more expensive car. In later years he summed up his approach to the Minor; that he wanted to design an [[economy car]] that \"the average man would take pleasure in owning, rather than feeling of it as something he'd been sentenced to\" and \"people who drive small cars are the same size as those who drive large cars and they should not be expected to put up with claustrophobic interiors.\"<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} Issigonis wanted the car to be as spacious as possible for its size, and comfortable to drive for inexperienced motorists. Just as he would with the [[Mini]] 10 years later, he designed the Mosquito with excellent [[automobile handling|roadholding]] and accurate, quick steering, not with any pretence of making a [[sports car]], but to make it safe and easy to drive by everyone.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|302}}\n\n===Original design features===\nIssigonis' design included the same ideas he had proposed for the Ten before the war:<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} [[independent suspension]], [[Rack and pinion#Steering|rack and pinion steering]], and [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unitary construction]]. In the case of the Mosquito, Issigonis was inspired by the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]],<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} a car he greatly admired, and he proposed using [[torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] on each wheel, as on the Citro\u00ebn, rather than the usual [[coil spring]] system. The French car, launched in 1934, had also been an early example of the use of rack and pinion steering.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|61}}\n\nNearly every feature of the Minor served the joint aims of good handling and maximum interior space. For example, Issigonis specified {{convert|14|in|adj=on}} wheels for the Mosquito. These were smaller than any other production car of the time (the existing Morris Eight had {{convert|17|in|adj=on}} wheels).<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} These small wheels reduced intrusion into the cabin space and minimised the car's [[unsprung mass]], giving better ride comfort and stability. For the same reasons, the wheels themselves were placed as far as possible towards each corner of the Mosquito's floorpan. The same went for the placement of the engine, as far as possible towards the front of the engine compartment.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|95}} Most cars of the time had a front beam axle, which forced the engine to be mounted behind the front axle line. While this meant that, with only a driver on board, the weight distribution was fairly even, when laden with passengers, cars often became severely tail-heavy, leading to unstable handling and [[understeer and oversteer|oversteer]]. The new Morris's independent suspension meant there was no front axle, allowing the engine to be placed low down and far forward. Putting the Mosquito's engine in the nose meant that the car was nose-heavy when lightly laden, leading to superior directional stability, and when fully laden it achieved nearly equal weight balance, so handling and grip remained good regardless of the load carried.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|62}} Placing the engine further forward also maximised cabin space.\n\nAs proposed by Issigonis, the engine itself was also radical, being a water-cooled [[flat-four engine|flat-four]] unit. One of Miles Thomas's few restrictions on the Mosquito project was that it had to have an engine that would not fall afoul of the British [[Tax horsepower#Britain|horsepower tax]], which taxed cars under a formula relating to their engine cylinder bore. At the same time, Thomas wanted the car to appeal to the all-important export markets, which had no such restrictions, and generally favoured larger-engined cars. Issigonis' solution was the flat-four engine, which could easily be produced in two versions \u2013 a narrow-bore 800-cc version for the British market and a wide-bore 1100-cc version for export.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|123}} Both versions would use identical parts, except for the actual cylinder blocks (which could still be produced on the same machinery) and the pistons. The flat-four layout reduced the overall length of the engine, further increasing potential cabin space, and reduced the car's centre of gravity for improved handling.\n\n===Pre-production changes===\nThe engine was to prove a step too far for the Mosquito project. As the car approached completion in 1946, the war was over and secrecy was no longer necessary or possible to maintain, as more and more Morris staff and executives had to be involved to start production. Many were pessimistic about the radical car's prospects and especially the huge cost in tooling up for a design that shared no parts with any existing Morris product. Lord Nuffield himself took a strong dislike to both the Mosquito and Issigonis, famously saying that the prototype resembled a poached egg.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|63}} Nuffield preferred to continue production of the conventional Morris Eight, which succeeded very well  before the war, with some minor styling and engineering improvements. He particularly objected to the Mosquito's expensive and unconventional engine design. Whatever Nuffield's personal views, all of the Mosquito's radical features were looking increasingly unlikely to be implemented while maintaining an acceptable final purchase price and without incurring too much setup costs at the Cowley factory. Thomas and Vic Oak drew up a plan to create a three-model range of cars using Issigonis' design - the Mosquito with an 800-cc engine, a mid-sized model (tentatively designated the Minor after a previous [[Morris Minor (1928)|small Morris]] launched in 1928) with an 1100-cc engine, and a new [[Morris Oxford]] with a 1500-cc version of the engine, all sharing different-sized variants of the same [[Car platform|platform]] and with sporting MG and luxury [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] versions to achieve further economies of scale.\n\nThere was also the matter of timing \u2013  a big rush existed for British manufacturers to get new models to market following the end of the war. [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] was known to be working on an all-new but [[Austin A40 Devon|conventional car]], which would be launched in 1947. The Mosquito was proposed for launch in 1949 and that deadline was appearing increasingly unlikely due to the untried nature of many of the car's features. The Morris board insisted on launching the Mosquito at the first postwar [[British International Motor Show|British Motor Show]] in October 1948.\n\nThis meant that several of Issigonis' proposals were reviewed \u2013 first the all-independent torsion bar suspension was changed for a torsion-sprung [[Beam axle|live rear axle]] and this was then substituted by a conventional [[leaf spring|leaf-sprung]] arrangement. All of Miles Thomas' suggestions for spreading the cost of developing the new car and broadening the design's appeal were treated sceptically by the Morris board and vetoed by Lord Nuffield. It became clear that the only way to overcome the personal and financial obstacles to the project was to adopt a lightly revised version of the Morris Eight's obsolete [[Flathead engine|side-valve]] engine.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|129}}  Thomas resigned his position at Morris Motors over the debacle.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|66}} Despite the changes the fundamental principles of Issigonis' concept \u2013 a spacious cabin, small wheels at each corner, a forward-placed engine, rack and pinion steering, and independent torsion-bar front suspension \u2013 remained.\n\nWhile Thomas had been battling for the Mosquito's future, Issigonis had been settling the car's styling. Although in his later career he became known for very functional designs, Issigonis was heavily influenced by the modern styling of American cars, especially the [[Packard Clipper]] and the [[Buick Super]].<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|62}} A new feature was a low-set headlamps, integral with the grille panel (Issigonis had originally sketched [[Hidden headlamp|hidden lamps]] concealed behind sections of the grille, but these were never implemented). The original Mosquito prototype, which drew Lord Nuffield's \"poached egg\" comment, was designed with similar proportions to prewar cars, being relatively narrow for its length. In late 1947, with Cowley already tooling up for production, Issigonis was unhappy with the appearance of the car. He had the prototype cut lengthways and the two halves moved apart until it looked \"right\".<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|128}} The production model was thus 4 inches (10&nbsp;cm) wider than the prototype, and in keeping with Issigonis' design principles, this further improved interior space and roadholding. It also gave the car distinctive (and recognisably modern) proportions \u2013 contrast with the [[Austin A30]], launched in 1952, but still recognisably prewar in size and proportions. The last-minute change to the design required a number of workarounds \u2013 [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] had already been produced, so early cars had ones cut in half with a four-inch plate bolted between the joint.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|129}} The bonnet had a flat fillet section added to its centreline and the floorpan had two two-inch sections added either side of the transmission tunnel.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|68}}\n\n===From Mosquito to Minor===\nThe last change made was to the car's name. The Mosquito codename was widely expected to be the name of the production model, but Nuffield disliked it. Also, Issigonis' last-minute size increase and the fitment of the larger-than-planned sidevalve engine needed to be considered; while still a small car, the new Morris was no longer the ultra-compact [[economy car]] that it had been on the drawing board, and the Mosquito name seemed inappropriate. Morris's marketing department wanted a reassuring name for what it worried would be an innovative, radical car that would be difficult to sell to a cautious public.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|66}} So, the Minor name, intended for the midsized model in Thomas' planned trio of new cars, was adopted for what would become the smallest postwar Morris. The original 1928 Morris Minor had itself introduced a number of innovative features and had been the first four-wheeled car to sell for \u00a3100.\n\nThe new Morris Minor was launched at the British Motor Show at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] in London on 27 October 1948. The original range consisted solely of a two-door saloon or a two-door tourer with a 918-cc engine and a starting price of \u00a3358. At the same show, Morris also launched the new [[Morris Oxford MO|Morris Oxford]] and [[Morris Six MS|Morris Six]] models, plus Wolseley variants of both cars, which were scaled-up versions of the new Minor, incorporating all the same features and designed with Issigonis' input under Oak's supervision. Thus, Issigonis' ideas and design principles underpinned the complete postwar Morris and Wolseley car ranges, although not the same extent that Miles Thomas had initially proposed.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|125}}\n\n==Minor MM==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | name       = Morris Minor MM\n | image      = File:Morris Minor MM (low-lights) 1950 moving.JPG\n | caption    = Morris Minor MM 2-door Saloon\n | production = 1948\u201353; 250,962 produced\n | assembly = {{Plainlist|\n*[[Oxford]], England\n*[[Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney|Victoria Park]], Australia<ref name=Anderson>Barry Anderson, Building Cars in Australia: Morris, Austin, BMC and Leyland 1950\u20131975, pages 204 to 208</ref>\n }}\n | engine     = 918&nbsp;cc ''Morris Sidevalve'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n | body_style = {{Plainlist|\n*2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]\n*4-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]\n*2-door [[convertible (car)|tourer]]\n }}\n | wheelbase  = {{Convert|86|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"autominded.net\">http://www.autominded.net/brochure/morris/Morris%201617.jpg</ref>\n | length     = {{Convert|148|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\nThe original Minor MM series was produced from 1948 until 1953. It included a pair of four-seat [[sedan (car)|saloons]], two-door and (from 1950) a four-door, and a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] four-seat Tourer. The front [[torsion bar]] suspension was shared with the larger [[Morris Oxford MO]], as was the almost-[[unibody]] construction. Although the Minor was originally designed to accept a [[flat-4]] engine, late in the development stage it was replaced by a {{convert|918|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[Flathead engine|side-valve]] [[inline-four engine]], little changed from that fitted in the early 1930s Morris Minor and Morris 8, with a bore of 57&nbsp;mm but with the stroke of 90&nbsp;mm and not 83&nbsp;mm, and producing 27.5&nbsp;hp (21&nbsp;kW) and 39&nbsp;lbf\u00b7ft (50.3&nbsp;N\u00b7m) of [[torque]].

This widening of 4&nbsp;inches (102&nbsp;mm) is also visible in the creases in the [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]]. Exports to the United States began in 1949 with the headlamps removed from within the grille surround to be mounted higher on the [[Fender (vehicle)|wings]] to meet local safety requirements. In 1950 a four-door version was released, initially available only for export, and featuring from the start the headlamps faired into the wings rather than set lower down on either side of the grille.<ref name=\"Autocar1950\">{{cite journal |title =Morris Minor Four-Door Saloon (road test)| journal =[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]| volume = | pages =  | date = 20 October 1950}}</ref>  The raised headlight position became standard on all Minors in time for 1951.<ref name=\"Autocar1950\"/> From the start, the Minor had semaphore-type turn indicators, and subsequent Minor versions persisted with these until 1961.<ref name=\"Willson 1995\"/> An ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' magazine road test in 1950 reported that these were \"not of the usual self-cancelling type, but incorporate[d] a time-basis return mechanism in a switch below the facia, in front of the driver\".<ref name=\"Autocar1950\"/> It was all too easy for a passenger hurriedly emerging from the front passenger seat to collide with and snap off a tardy indicator \"flipper\" that was still sticking out of the B-pillar, having not yet been safely returned by the time-basis return mechanism to its folded position.\nAnother innovation towards the end of 1950 was a water pump (replacing a gravity dependent system), which permitted the manufacturer to offer an interior heater \"as optional equipment\".<ref name=\"Autocar1950\"/>\n\nWhen production of the first series ended, just over a quarter of a million had been sold, 30% of them the convertible Tourer model.\n\nA 918&nbsp;cc-engined tourer tested by the British magazine ''[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]'' in 1950 had a top speed of {{convert |58.7|mph|km/h|abbr =on}} and could accelerate from 0\u2013{{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 29.2&nbsp;seconds.

As part of a rationalisation programme to reduce the production of duplicate components for similar vehicles, the Minor drivetrain was completely replaced with an Austin-derived engine, gearbox, propshaft, differential and axle casing. The more modern [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]]-designed {{convert|803|cc|cid|abbr=on}} overhead valve [[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]] engine, which had been designed for the Minor's main rival, the [[Austin A30]], was smaller in all dimensions, but nevertheless gave noticeable performance improvements over the pre-war side-valve {{convert|918|cc|cid|abbr=on}} Morris unit it replaced. The 52&nbsp;second drive to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) was still calm, but top speed increased to 63&nbsp;mph (101&nbsp;km/h). Fuel consumption also rose to {{convert|36|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}}.\n\nAn estate version was introduced in 1952, known as the Traveller (a Morris naming tradition for estates, also seen on the [[Mini]]). The Traveller featured an external structural [[Fraxinus|ash]] (wood) frame for the rear bodywork, with two side-hinged rear doors. The frame was varnished rather than painted and a highly visible feature of the body style. Travellers were built alongside the saloon model at Cowley minus their rear bodies. The half-completed cars were then shipped to the [[MG Cars|MG]] factory at [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] where the bodies (built in [[Coventry]]) would be mated to the chassis and the final assembly carried out. This was because the main Cowley production lines were no longer fully equipped to deal with body-on-frame vehicles such as the Traveller while the MG lines still handled these sorts of cars and had experience working with wood-framed bodies. Commercial models, marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up were added in May 1953.<ref name=Newell>Ray Newell, Morris Minor, 60 Years on the Road, pages 106 to 118</ref> Rear bodies of the van versions were all steel. The four-seat convertible and saloon variants continued as well.\n\n''[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]'' magazine tested a four-door saloon in 1952.

Where previously the Minor had been offered with a broad range of colours and trim options, the 'Minor 1000' (so named for its 948cc engine) shifted emphasis towards rationalisation of components to access improved economies of scale, and thus enabled increased production volumes to help the Minor retain a significant share of the small car market during a period where car ownership was becoming more commonplace.\n\nThe dawn of the motorway era necessitated the fitting of a new [[BMC A-Series engine#948|948cc]] (57.9 cu in) variant of the [[BMC A-Series engine]], elevating top speed from 63&nbsp;mph to 75&nbsp;mph, and reducing 0-60&nbsp;mph acceleration from 52.5 secs to 31.3 secs.<ref>http://www.gbclassiccars.co.uk/morris_minor.html</ref> Driving was further improved by a substantially revised gearbox, which incorporated taller ratios for more relaxed cruising speeds and a remote selector allowing a shorter gear lever and less ponderous gearchange action. This new engine and gearbox was the product of a broader engine policy at BMC, and had been developed for use in a range of their smaller vehicles, including the [[Austin A35]], [[Austin A40 Farina|A40 Farina]], and [[Austin-Healey Sprite]]/[[MG Midget]], to maximise parts sharing and thus reduce production costs, servicing costs and consumer costs across the model range.\n\nA series of changes to the body pressings for the roof/scuttle and bonnet panels yielded a large wraparound rear windscreen and one-piece curved front windscreen, which markedly improved visibility and lent a modernised appearance to the car at relatively small outlay.\n\nMany of the 'luxury' items, such as leather trim, were replaced with more durable and cheaper materials, and over the course of the following years the range of available paint and interior colours was dramatically reduced. Various unique Minor trim items and components (such as light units and heaters) were also gradually replaced with ubiquitous items from the BMC range. This programme of changes succeeded in giving access to improved economies of scale to allow production to be ramped up. By the turn of the 1960s, over 100,000 Minors were being produced per year, compared to fewer than 50,000 per year a decade earlier.<ref name=\"morrisminorspares.com\">http://www.morrisminorspares.com/production-figures-i19</ref>\n\nIn 1961 the [[flag semaphore|semaphore]]-style [[trafficators]] were replaced by [[Turn signal|flashing direction indicators]]. These were US-style red at the rear (using the same bulb filament as the brake lamp) and white at the front (using a second brighter filament in the parking lamp bulb) which was legal in the UK and many export markets at the time (such as New Zealand). On the two door cars, the rear wings were modified to remove the openings for the trafficators; on the 4-door, the B-pillar pressing was modified to leave a \u2018blank\u2019 in place of the trafficator housing.\n\nAn upmarket car based on the Minor floorpan using the larger [[BMC B-Series engine]] was sold as the [[Riley One-Point-Five]]/Wolseley 1500 beginning in 1957: versions of this Wolseley/Riley variant were also produced by [[BMC Australia]] as the [[Morris Major]] and the [[Austin Lancer]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\n1960 Morris Minor 1000 2-door sedan (26676151933).jpg|Morris Minor 1000 2-door saloon\n1962 Morris Minor 1000 sedan (18823882102).jpg|Morris Minor 1000 4-door saloon\nMorris Minor 1000 01.JPG|Morris Minor 1000 Convertible\nTraveller (4196830669).jpg|Morris Minor 1000 Traveller<br>(registered February 1966)\nMorris Minor Emblem.jpg|Morris Minor bonnet ornament\nMM1000 4DS 1956 06 innen 2005.jpg|Interior\n</gallery>\n{{clear_left}}\n\n===Minor Million===\nIn December 1960 the Morris Minor became the first British car to sell more than 1,000,000 units. To commemorate the achievement, a limited edition of 350 two-door Minor saloons (one for each UK Morris dealership) was produced with distinctive lilac paintwork and a white interior. Also the badge name on the side of the bonnet was modified to read \"Minor 1,000,000\" instead of the standard \"Minor 1000\". The millionth Minor was donated to the [[National Union of Journalists]], which planned to use it as a prize in a competition in aid of the union's Widow and Orphan Fund. The company, at the same time, presented a celebratory Minor to London's [[Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children]], but this car was constructed of cake.<ref name = PracticalMotorist196103>{{cite journal |title=News Summary: Morris Minor Million |journal=Practical Motorist |volume=7 |number=79 |page=713 |date=March 1961}}</ref>\n\n===Series V (ADO59)===\nThe final major upgrades to the Minor were made in 1962. Although the name ''Minor 1000'' was retained, the changes were sufficient for the new model to be given its own [[British Motor Corporation#BMC project numbers|ADO development number]]. Morris chassis numbering convention refers to these cars as 'Series V', the 'Series IV' designation having been assigned to the [[Mini#Mark I Mini: 1959\u201367|Morris Mini Minor]].<ref name=\"potteries.mmoc.org.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://potteries.mmoc.org.uk/Identify.htm|title=Welcome to the Website for the Potteries branch of the Morris Minor Owners Club|website=potteries.mmoc.org.uk|access-date=13 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nA new, larger version of the existing [[BMC A-Series engine#1098|A-Series]] engine had been developed in conjunction with cylinder head specialist [[Weslake|Harry Weslake]] for the then new [[BMC ADO16|ADO16]] Austin/Morris 1100 range. This new engine used a taller block than the 948&nbsp;cc unit, with increased bore and stroke bringing total capacity up to 1,098&nbsp;cc. Although fuel consumption suffered moderately at 38&nbsp;mpg, the Minor's top speed increased to 77&nbsp;mph (124&nbsp;km/h), and a 20% increase in torque<ref name=\"potteries.mmoc.org.uk\"/> gave an altogether more responsive drive. The revised engine was teamed to a stronger gearbox fitted with [[Manual transmission#Synchromesh|baulk ring synchromesh]] replacing the previous cone-clutch type. Drum brakes were retained on each corner, but the front units were increased from 7 inches (18&nbsp;cm) to 8 inches (20&nbsp;cm) in diameter. Other changes included a modified dashboard with toggle switches, white-on-black speedometer unit (incorporating a warning light for a blocked oil filter), textured alloy fascia, and a new glove-box cover design (a fully enclosing bottom-hinged cover on the passenger side, and fixed open aperture surround on the driver's side). A two-spoke 'safety' steering wheel (shared with the [[BMC ADO16|Morris 1100]]) and new heater (now with fresh air ventilation) were fitted in 1964, completing the interior upgrade. Larger combined front side/indicator light units, common to many [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] vehicles of the time, were fitted to the front wings, and larger tail lamp units were fitted at the rear. Both incorporated separate amber flashers for directional indicators.\n\nFrom 1965, no further production improvements were made to the Minor,<ref>http://mmoc-ni.co.uk/2012/12/03/minor-history/</ref> with resource being channelled into improving the [[BMC ADO16|ADO16]] (the Minor's spiritual successor and Britain's best-selling car in the 1960s), and development of the [[Morris Marina]], which would succeed the Minor on the Cowley production lines in 1971.\n\nIn 1969, production of the Traveller variants was moved to the ex-[[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] plant at [[Adderley Park]], where the van and pick-up models were already made. This freed up production space at [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] and simplified the production chain as the Traveller's rear bodies were built at the Morris Bodies factory in [[Coventry]]. Adderley Park-built Travellers were offered in a new range of colours from the paint range that had been introduced for 1970, including vibrant shades such as Limeflower ([[lime green]]) and Aqua ([[turquoise]]). From 1971 Minors were fitted with a steering-column mounted ignition key and a steering lock rather than the facia-mounted ignition switch used up to that point.\n\n;Engines\n*1956\u201362 (Series III): 948 cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine#948|A-series]]'' [[Inline-four engine|inline-four]], 37&nbsp;bhp (28&nbsp;kW) at 4,750&nbsp;rpm and 50&nbsp;lb/ft (68&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 2,500&nbsp;rpm\n*1962\u201372 (Series V): 1,098 cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine#1098|A-series]]'' inline-four, 48&nbsp;bhp (36&nbsp;kW) at 5,100&nbsp;rpm and 60&nbsp;lb/ft (81&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 2,500&nbsp;rpm<ref name=\"potteries.mmoc.org.uk\"/>\n\n==Decline and replacement==\nDuring the life of the Minor 1000 model, production declined &ndash; as the [[Mini]] and [[BMC ADO16|1100/1300]] had become BMC's best selling models by the mid 1960s.\n\nThe last Convertible/Tourer was manufactured on 18 August 1969,<ref name =Motor196908>{{Cite journal | authorlink = Charles Bulmer (Ed)| title = News: Last Minor Convertible sold | journal = [[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]| volume = 3506| page = 52 |date = 30 August 1969}}</ref> and the saloon models were discontinued in November 1970. Production of the more practical Traveller and commercial versions ceased in April 1971. According to Newell (1997), 1.6 million&nbsp;Minors were made in total and Wainwright (2008) even claims that 1,619,857 Minors of all variants were ultimately sold.<ref>[https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/morris/minor/]</ref>\n\n===The Minor vs Volkswagen===\nThe decline and cancellation of Minor production was source of some consternation by industry commentators in the late 1960s,<ref name=\"Cowin, Chris 2012\">Cowin, Chris (2012), ''British Leyland: Chronicle of a Car Crash'' ({{ISBN|9781477560679}}) p.57</ref> who believed that further development of the car had the potential to challenge the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] in export markets. The Volkswagen, which was developed as a small family car with a very similar brief to the Minor, had been upgraded consistently over 25 years, and retained a healthy market share in export markets (especially developing countries), where it was very often the lowest priced new car on the market.<ref>Howard, Tony (December 1976). \"New VWs reflect determinedly cheerful mood\". SA Motor. Cape Town, South Africa: Scott Publications: 31\u201332.</ref> It went on to achieve over 21 million units before cancellation in 2003. Having said this, in the year of the Minor's cancellation (1971), over 1.3 million Beetles were produced (its peak year of production).<ref>https://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/beetle_productionfigures.php</ref> This corresponded to over 80% of total Minor production in 23 years, or ten times the production volume of Minors in their peak year (1958) when 113,699 were built.<ref name=\"morrisminorspares.com\"/> This gulf of production capacity made the Minor's ability to effectively challenge the Beetle, which had a global distributor and servicing network, moot. Some historians also report that the Minor was being sold at a loss during its final years.<ref name=\"Cowin, Chris 2012\"/> British Leyland management were pinning hopes for greater market share and profitability on the Morris Marina, which was being specifically developed for assembly on the Minor production lines at Cowley, thereby precluding the continuance of Minor production in any event.\n\n===Successors===\nThe Minor was officially replaced on the Cowley production lines by the [[Morris Marina]] (ADO28), which was developed primarily in response to Ford's top-selling (and in many respects, conservatively engineered) [[Ford Escort (Europe)#First generation (1967\u20131975)|Escort]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/2011/07/21/the-cars-bmc-18002200-development-history/ |title=The cars: BMC 1800/2200 development history |publisher=AROnline |date=11 April 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002180934/http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/2011/07/21/the-cars-bmc-18002200-development-history/ |archive-date=2 October 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Building a larger mid-sized car capable of volume sales (particularly in the lucrative fleet-buying market) was becoming increasingly key in maintaining healthy sales figures, and was an issue BMC had consistently failed to address hitherto.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/morris/marina-ital/morris-marina-development-history/ |title=The cars : Morris Marina development story |publisher=AROnline |date=19 December 2017 |accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> The Marina was developed under the watchful eye of [[British Leyland]] management, and used a modified version of the Minor chassis floorplan, extended to increase the wheelbase by  10 inches.

The crisp styling, hydrolastic suspension and innovative front-wheel drive system (itself a \"scaling-up\" of the [[Mini]] principle) made ADO16 a worthy successor to the (in its day) strikingly forward-looking Minor.

Provisions were made for seat belt fittings in the early '60s, but the rigid structure of the car's monocoque body made it dangerously unabsorbent to impact.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} For a short time in 1968, the thickness of the steel used in the bonnet and doors was decreased from 1.2&nbsp;mm to 1.0&nbsp;mm to act as a form of [[crumple zone]], but as the wings continued to be made of 1.4&nbsp;mm mild steel, the modification was pointless and ineffectual and was reversed in 1969 as it increased passenger compartment crush in collisions.\n\nThe Mark II model changed from the \"lowlight\" model to comply with Canadian lighting standards, with higher and brighter headlights to increase visibility in fog and during dark Canadian winters.\n\nAustralian models, and tourer models made in Britain and exported to Australia, featured safety glass windscreens and safety glass windows, to comply with local regulations.

They were designed for commercial use with small businesses, although many were also used by larger corporations. Van versions were popular with the [[General Post Office]], the early versions of these (to around 1956) having rubber front wings to cope with the sometimes unforgiving busy situations in which they were expected to work. Both the van and the pickup differed from the monocoque construction of the Saloon and Traveller variants by having a separate chassis. They also differed in details such as telescopic rear dampers, stiffer rear leaf springs and lower-ratio differentials to cope with heavier loads.\n\nThe commercial versions were initially marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up, with a Series III designation applied from 1956.<ref name=Newell/> The names Morris 6cwt Van and Pickup was used following the introduction of the 1098cc engine in 1962<ref name=Newell/> and 8cwt versions were added in 1968.<ref name=Newell/><ref>A [[Hundredweight|Cwt]] was the short-form term for a \"hundredweight\" which was a pre-metric unit of weight measurement used in Britain, equivalent to about 50&nbsp;kg.

The enduring affection for the \"Moggie\" (also a common British nickname for an undistinguished cat, or a [[Morgan Motor Company|Morgan]]) or \"Morrie\" (as it is often known in Australia and New Zealand) is reflected in the number of restored and improved Morris Minors currently running in Britain and [[Australasia]]. In addition to more powerful engines, desirable improvements necessitated by the increase in traffic density since the Minor was withdrawn from volume production include the replacement of the original equipment drum brakes with [[disc brake|discs]]. Other important upgrades include the {{convert|1275|cc|cid|abbr=on}} version of the [[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]] engine, derided by [[Morris Marina]] enthusiasts as a key reason why many Marinas were scrapped, and the similarly sized [[Nissan A engine]], which shares all common dimensions to the Morris Minor engine, except piston size. ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]] once stated that the Morris Minor is Britain's [[Volkswagen Beetle]] (although this was meant in a derogatory way rather than favourably). There is still an extensive parts backup for these cars, and parts are cheap compared to modern day cars.\n\nReplacement panels for the Morris Minor were still being made in 2002 by the [[Durable Car Company]] in [[Sri Lanka]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Newell, Ray (1997), ''Original Morris Minor'' (Bay View Books Ltd, Bideford, Devon, {{ISBN|1-870979-43-5}})\n*Wainwright, Martin (2008), ''Morris Minor \u2013 The Biography'' (Aurum Press, {{ISBN|978-1-84513-378-8}})\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.morrisdownunder.com/forum/index.php \u2013 Morris Minor community forum\n*http://MORRISMINOR.US \u2013 Morris Minor Registry of North America\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{dmoz|/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models/Morris/|Morris}}\n\n{{Automobiles made by BMC, BL and Rover Group companies, post-1945}}\n{{British Motor Holdings and British Leyland cars, 1966-1986}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[Category:Morris vehicles|Minor]]\n[[Category:Issigonis vehicles]]\n[[Category:1940s cars]]\n[[Category:Subcompact cars]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:Vans]]\n[[Category:Pickup trucks]]\n[[Category:1950s cars]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1948]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the motor car manufactured by [[Morris Motors|Morris Motors Limited]] from 1948 to 1972|the Morris Minor manufactured by Morris Motors Limited from 1928 to 1933|Morris Minor (1928)|the 1980s pop band|Morris Minor and the Majors}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n | name           = Morris Minor\n | image          = Morris Minor 1000 in New Square first registered February 1963 948cc and an icon.jpg\n | caption        = Morris Minor 1000 4-door saloon\n | manufacturer   = [[Morris Motors]] (1948-1952)<br>[[British Motor Corporation]] (1952-1968)<br>[[British Leyland]] (1968-1971)\n | production     = 1948\u201371; 1,368,291 produced\n | assembly       = [[Cowley, Oxford]], [[England]]<br />Malaysia<br />Australia<ref>{{citation | first = Pedr | last = Davis | title = The Macquarie Dictionary of Motoring | year = 1986 | page = 337 | location = Australia }}</ref><br />New Zealand<ref name=NZA>{{citation | ref = NZa | title = Assembly: New Zealand Car Production 1921\u201398 | last = Webster | first = Mark | publisher = Reed | year = 2002 | page = 1 | location = Birkenhead, Auckland, New Zealand | isbn = 0-7900-0846-7 }}</ref>\n | wheelbase      = {{convert|86|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=DlyExpressLonMoShoRev1966>{{Cite journal | last = Cardew | first = Basil | journal = Daily Express | title = Review of the 1966 Motor Show | year = 1966 | publisher = Beaverbrook Newspapers | location = London | id = }}</ref>\n | width          = {{convert|60|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | length = {{convert|148|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | height         = {{convert|60|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | weight         = {{convert|1708|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} (four-door saloon)\n | class          = [[Subcompact car]]\n | predecessor    = [[Morris Eight]]\n | successor      = [[Morris Marina]]\n | designer       = [[Alec Issigonis|Sir Alec Issigonis]]\n | layout         = [[FR layout]]\n |sp = uk}}\n\nThe '''Morris Minor''' is a British car that made its debut at the [[Earls Court]] Motor Show, London, on 20 September 1948.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.morrisminoroc.co.uk/index.php?page=452 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903162336/http://www.morrisminoroc.co.uk/index.php?page=452 |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 September 2012 |title=60th Birthday Celebration at British Motor Industry Heritage Centre, Gaydon |publisher=Morris Minor OC |location=UK |accessdate=9 October 2010 }}</ref> Designed under the leadership of [[Alec Issigonis]], more than 1.6&nbsp;million were manufactured between 1948 and 1972 in three series: the MM (1948 to 1953), the Series II (1952 to 1956), and the 1000 series (1956 to 1971).\n\nInitially available as a two-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]] and [[tourer]] (convertible), the range was expanded to include a four-door saloon in 1950, a [[Woodie (car body style)|wood-framed]] [[station wagon|estate car]] (the Traveller) from October 1953 and [[panel van]] and [[pick-up truck]] variants from May<ref>Paul Skilleter's book \"The world's supreme small car Morris Minor\"\n</ref> 1953.

Although the [[Nuffield Organization]] was heavily involved in [[World War II|war work]] and a governmental ban existed on civilian car production, Morris Motors' vice chairman, [[Miles Thomas]], wanted to prepare the ground for new products to be launched as soon as the war was over.<ref name=\"issigonis\">{{Cite book| last=Bardsley | first=Gillian | title=Issigonis: The Official Biography | page= | publisher= Icon Books | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-84046-687-4}}</ref>{{rp|115}} Vic Oak, the company's chief engineer, had already brought to Thomas' attention a promising junior engineer, [[Alec Issigonis]], who had been employed at Morris since 1935 and specialised in [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] design,<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|85}} but he had frequently impressed Oak with his advanced ideas about car design in general.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|114}} Issigonis had come to Oak's particular attention with his work on the new [[Morris Ten#Morris Ten series M|Morris Ten]], which was in development during 1936/7. This was the first Morris to use [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unitary construction]] and was conceived with [[Independent suspension|independent front suspension]]. Issigonis designed a coil-sprung wishbone system, which was later dropped on cost grounds. Although the design was later used on the [[MG Y-type]] and many other postwar [[MG Cars|MGs]], the Morris Ten entered production with a front [[beam axle]]. Despite his brief being to focus on the Ten's suspension, Issigonis had also drawn up a [[Rack and pinion#Steering|rack and pinion steering]] system for the car. Like his suspension design, this was not adopted, but resurfaced in the postwar years on the MG Y-type, but these ideas proved that he was the perfect candidate to lead the design work on a new advanced small car.\n\nWith virtually all resources required for the war effort, Thomas nonetheless approved the development of a new small family car that would replace the [[Morris Eight]]. Although Oak (and Morris's technical director, Sidney Smith) were in overall charge of the project, Issigonis  was ultimately responsible for the design, working with only two other [[Drafter|draughtsmen]].<ref name=\"minorbio\">{{Cite book| last=Wainwright | first=Martin | title=Morris Minor: The Biography | page= | publisher= Aurum | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-84513-509-6}}</ref>{{rp|60}} Thomas named the project 'Mosquito' and ensured that it remained as secret as possible,<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|117}} both from the [[Ministry of Supply]] and from company founder William Morris ([[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|Lord Nuffield]]), who was still chairman of Morris Motors, and as widely expected, would not look favourably on Issigonis' radical ideas.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|63}}\n\nIssigonis' overall concept was to produce a practical, economical, and affordable car for the general public that would equal, if not surpass, the convenience and design quality of a more expensive car. In later years he summed up his approach to the Minor; that he wanted to design an [[economy car]] that \"the average man would take pleasure in owning, rather than feeling of it as something he'd been sentenced to\" and \"people who drive small cars are the same size as those who drive large cars and they should not be expected to put up with claustrophobic interiors.\"<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} Issigonis wanted the car to be as spacious as possible for its size, and comfortable to drive for inexperienced motorists. Just as he would with the [[Mini]] 10 years later, he designed the Mosquito with excellent [[automobile handling|roadholding]] and accurate, quick steering, not with any pretence of making a [[sports car]], but to make it safe and easy to drive by everyone.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|302}}\n\n===Original design features===\nIssigonis' design included the same ideas he had proposed for the Ten before the war:<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} [[independent suspension]], [[Rack and pinion#Steering|rack and pinion steering]], and [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unitary construction]]. In the case of the Mosquito, Issigonis was inspired by the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]],<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} a car he greatly admired, and he proposed using [[torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] on each wheel, as on the Citro\u00ebn, rather than the usual [[coil spring]] system. The French car, launched in 1934, had also been an early example of the use of rack and pinion steering.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|61}}\n\nNearly every feature of the Minor served the joint aims of good handling and maximum interior space. For example, Issigonis specified {{convert|14|in|adj=on}} wheels for the Mosquito. These were smaller than any other production car of the time (the existing Morris Eight had {{convert|17|in|adj=on}} wheels).<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} These small wheels reduced intrusion into the cabin space and minimised the car's [[unsprung mass]], giving better ride comfort and stability. For the same reasons, the wheels themselves were placed as far as possible towards each corner of the Mosquito's floorpan. The same went for the placement of the engine, as far as possible towards the front of the engine compartment.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|95}} Most cars of the time had a front beam axle, which forced the engine to be mounted behind the front axle line. While this meant that, with only a driver on board, the weight distribution was fairly even, when laden with passengers, cars often became severely tail-heavy, leading to unstable handling and [[understeer and oversteer|oversteer]]. The new Morris's independent suspension meant there was no front axle, allowing the engine to be placed low down and far forward. Putting the Mosquito's engine in the nose meant that the car was nose-heavy when lightly laden, leading to superior directional stability, and when fully laden it achieved nearly equal weight balance, so handling and grip remained good regardless of the load carried.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|62}} Placing the engine further forward also maximised cabin space.\n\nAs proposed by Issigonis, the engine itself was also radical, being a water-cooled [[flat-four engine|flat-four]] unit. One of Miles Thomas's few restrictions on the Mosquito project was that it had to have an engine that would not fall afoul of the British [[Tax horsepower#Britain|horsepower tax]], which taxed cars under a formula relating to their engine cylinder bore. At the same time, Thomas wanted the car to appeal to the all-important export markets, which had no such restrictions, and generally favoured larger-engined cars. Issigonis' solution was the flat-four engine, which could easily be produced in two versions \u2013 a narrow-bore 800-cc version for the British market and a wide-bore 1100-cc version for export.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|123}} Both versions would use identical parts, except for the actual cylinder blocks (which could still be produced on the same machinery) and the pistons. The flat-four layout reduced the overall length of the engine, further increasing potential cabin space, and reduced the car's centre of gravity for improved handling.\n\n===Pre-production changes===\nThe engine was to prove a step too far for the Mosquito project. As the car approached completion in 1946, the war was over and secrecy was no longer necessary or possible to maintain, as more and more Morris staff and executives had to be involved to start production. Many were pessimistic about the radical car's prospects and especially the huge cost in tooling up for a design that shared no parts with any existing Morris product. Lord Nuffield himself took a strong dislike to both the Mosquito and Issigonis, famously saying that the prototype resembled a poached egg.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|63}} Nuffield preferred to continue production of the conventional Morris Eight, which succeeded very well  before the war, with some minor styling and engineering improvements. He particularly objected to the Mosquito's expensive and unconventional engine design. Whatever Nuffield's personal views, all of the Mosquito's radical features were looking increasingly unlikely to be implemented while maintaining an acceptable final purchase price and without incurring too much setup costs at the Cowley factory. Thomas and Vic Oak drew up a plan to create a three-model range of cars using Issigonis' design - the Mosquito with an 800-cc engine, a mid-sized model (tentatively designated the Minor after a previous [[Morris Minor (1928)|small Morris]] launched in 1928) with an 1100-cc engine, and a new [[Morris Oxford]] with a 1500-cc version of the engine, all sharing different-sized variants of the same [[Car platform|platform]] and with sporting MG and luxury [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] versions to achieve further economies of scale.\n\nThere was also the matter of timing \u2013  a big rush existed for British manufacturers to get new models to market following the end of the war. [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] was known to be working on an all-new but [[Austin A40 Devon|conventional car]], which would be launched in 1947. The Mosquito was proposed for launch in 1949 and that deadline was appearing increasingly unlikely due to the untried nature of many of the car's features. The Morris board insisted on launching the Mosquito at the first postwar [[British International Motor Show|British Motor Show]] in October 1948.\n\nThis meant that several of Issigonis' proposals were reviewed \u2013 first the all-independent torsion bar suspension was changed for a torsion-sprung [[Beam axle|live rear axle]] and this was then substituted by a conventional [[leaf spring|leaf-sprung]] arrangement. All of Miles Thomas' suggestions for spreading the cost of developing the new car and broadening the design's appeal were treated sceptically by the Morris board and vetoed by Lord Nuffield. It became clear that the only way to overcome the personal and financial obstacles to the project was to adopt a lightly revised version of the Morris Eight's obsolete [[Flathead engine|side-valve]] engine.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|129}}  Thomas resigned his position at Morris Motors over the debacle.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|66}} Despite the changes the fundamental principles of Issigonis' concept \u2013 a spacious cabin, small wheels at each corner, a forward-placed engine, rack and pinion steering, and independent torsion-bar front suspension \u2013 remained.\n\nWhile Thomas had been battling for the Mosquito's future, Issigonis had been settling the car's styling. Although in his later career he became known for very functional designs, Issigonis was heavily influenced by the modern styling of American cars, especially the [[Packard Clipper]] and the [[Buick Super]].<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|62}} A new feature was a low-set headlamps, integral with the grille panel (Issigonis had originally sketched [[Hidden headlamp|hidden lamps]] concealed behind sections of the grille, but these were never implemented). The original Mosquito prototype, which drew Lord Nuffield's \"poached egg\" comment, was designed with similar proportions to prewar cars, being relatively narrow for its length. In late 1947, with Cowley already tooling up for production, Issigonis was unhappy with the appearance of the car. He had the prototype cut lengthways and the two halves moved apart until it looked \"right\".<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|128}} The production model was thus 4 inches (10&nbsp;cm) wider than the prototype, and in keeping with Issigonis' design principles, this further improved interior space and roadholding. It also gave the car distinctive (and recognisably modern) proportions \u2013 contrast with the [[Austin A30]], launched in 1952, but still recognisably prewar in size and proportions. The last-minute change to the design required a number of workarounds \u2013 [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] had already been produced, so early cars had ones cut in half with a four-inch plate bolted between the joint.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|129}} The bonnet had a flat fillet section added to its centreline and the floorpan had two two-inch sections added either side of the transmission tunnel.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|68}}\n\n===From Mosquito to Minor===\nThe last change made was to the car's name. The Mosquito codename was widely expected to be the name of the production model, but Nuffield disliked it. Also, Issigonis' last-minute size increase and the fitment of the larger-than-planned sidevalve engine needed to be considered; while still a small car, the new Morris was no longer the ultra-compact [[economy car]] that it had been on the drawing board, and the Mosquito name seemed inappropriate. Morris's marketing department wanted a reassuring name for what it worried would be an innovative, radical car that would be difficult to sell to a cautious public.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|66}} So, the Minor name, intended for the midsized model in Thomas' planned trio of new cars, was adopted for what would become the smallest postwar Morris. The original 1928 Morris Minor had itself introduced a number of innovative features and had been the first four-wheeled car to sell for \u00a3100.\n\nThe new Morris Minor was launched at the British Motor Show at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] in London on 27 October 1948. The original range consisted solely of a two-door saloon or a two-door tourer with a 918-cc engine and a starting price of \u00a3358. At the same show, Morris also launched the new [[Morris Oxford MO|Morris Oxford]] and [[Morris Six MS|Morris Six]] models, plus Wolseley variants of both cars, which were scaled-up versions of the new Minor, incorporating all the same features and designed with Issigonis' input under Oak's supervision. Thus, Issigonis' ideas and design principles underpinned the complete postwar Morris and Wolseley car ranges, although not the same extent that Miles Thomas had initially proposed.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|125}}\n\n==Minor MM==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | name       = Morris Minor MM\n | image      = File:Morris Minor MM (low-lights) 1950 moving.JPG\n | caption    = Morris Minor MM 2-door Saloon\n | production = 1948\u201353; 250,962 produced\n | assembly = {{Plainlist|\n*[[Oxford]], England\n*[[Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney|Victoria Park]], Australia<ref name=Anderson>Barry Anderson, Building Cars in Australia: Morris, Austin, BMC and Leyland 1950\u20131975, pages 204 to 208</ref>\n }}\n | engine     = 918&nbsp;cc ''Morris Sidevalve'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n | body_style = {{Plainlist|\n*2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]\n*4-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]\n*2-door [[convertible (car)|tourer]]\n }}\n | wheelbase  = {{Convert|86|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"autominded.net\">http://www.autominded.net/brochure/morris/Morris%201617.jpg</ref>\n | length     = {{Convert|148|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\nThe original Minor MM series was produced from 1948 until 1953. It included a pair of four-seat [[sedan (car)|saloons]], two-door and (from 1950) a four-door, and a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] four-seat Tourer. The front [[torsion bar]] suspension was shared with the larger [[Morris Oxford MO]], as was the almost-[[unibody]] construction. Although the Minor was originally designed to accept a [[flat-4]] engine, late in the development stage it was replaced by a {{convert|918|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[Flathead engine|side-valve]] [[inline-four engine]], little changed from that fitted in the early 1930s Morris Minor and Morris 8, with a bore of 57&nbsp;mm but with the stroke of 90&nbsp;mm and not 83&nbsp;mm, and producing 27.5&nbsp;hp (21&nbsp;kW) and 39&nbsp;lbf\u00b7ft (50.3&nbsp;N\u00b7m) of [[torque]].

Exports to the United States began in 1949 with the headlamps removed from within the grille surround to be mounted higher on the [[Fender (vehicle)|wings]] to meet local safety requirements. In 1950 a four-door version was released, initially available only for export, and featuring from the start the headlamps faired into the wings rather than set lower down on either side of the grille.<ref name=\"Autocar1950\">{{cite journal |title =Morris Minor Four-Door Saloon (road test)| journal =[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]| volume = | pages =  | date = 20 October 1950}}</ref>  The raised headlight position became standard on all Minors in time for 1951.<ref name=\"Autocar1950\"/> From the start, the Minor had semaphore-type turn indicators, and subsequent Minor versions persisted with these until 1961.<ref name=\"Willson 1995\"/> An ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' magazine road test in 1950 reported that these were \"not of the usual self-cancelling type, but incorporate[d] a time-basis return mechanism in a switch below the facia, in front of the driver\".<ref name=\"Autocar1950\"/> It was all too easy for a passenger hurriedly emerging from the front passenger seat to collide with and snap off a tardy indicator \"flipper\" that was still sticking out of the B-pillar, having not yet been safely returned by the time-basis return mechanism to its folded position.\nAnother innovation towards the end of 1950 was a water pump (replacing a gravity dependent system), which permitted the manufacturer to offer an interior heater \"as optional equipment\".<ref name=\"Autocar1950\"/>\n\nWhen production of the first series ended, just over a quarter of a million had been sold, 30% of them the convertible Tourer model.\n\nA 918&nbsp;cc-engined tourer tested by the British magazine ''[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]'' in 1950 had a top speed of {{convert |58.7|mph|km/h|abbr =on}} and could accelerate from 0\u2013{{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 29.2&nbsp;seconds.

As part of a rationalisation programme to reduce the production of duplicate components for similar vehicles, the Minor drivetrain was completely replaced with an Austin-derived engine, gearbox, propshaft, differential and axle casing. The more modern [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]]-designed {{convert|803|cc|cid|abbr=on}} overhead valve [[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]] engine, which had been designed for the Minor's main rival, the [[Austin A30]], was smaller in all dimensions, but nevertheless gave noticeable performance improvements over the pre-war side-valve {{convert|918|cc|cid|abbr=on}} Morris unit it replaced. The 52&nbsp;second drive to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) was still calm, but top speed increased to 63&nbsp;mph (101&nbsp;km/h). Fuel consumption also rose to {{convert|36|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}}.\n\nAn estate version was introduced in 1952, known as the Traveller (a Morris naming tradition for estates, also seen on the [[Mini]]). The Traveller featured an external structural [[Fraxinus|ash]] (wood) frame for the rear bodywork, with two side-hinged rear doors. The frame was varnished rather than painted and a highly visible feature of the body style. Travellers were built alongside the saloon model at Cowley minus their rear bodies. The half-completed cars were then shipped to the [[MG Cars|MG]] factory at [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] where the bodies (built in [[Coventry]]) would be mated to the chassis and the final assembly carried out. This was because the main Cowley production lines were no longer fully equipped to deal with body-on-frame vehicles such as the Traveller while the MG lines still handled these sorts of cars and had experience working with wood-framed bodies. Commercial models, marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up were added in May 1953.<ref name=Newell>Ray Newell, Morris Minor, 60 Years on the Road, pages 106 to 118</ref> Rear bodies of the van versions were all steel.

Where previously the Minor had been offered with a broad range of colours and trim options, the 'Minor 1000' (so named for its 948cc engine) shifted emphasis towards rationalisation of components to access improved economies of scale, and thus enabled increased production volumes to help the Minor retain a significant share of the small car market during a period where car ownership was becoming more commonplace.\n\nThe dawn of the motorway era necessitated the fitting of a new [[BMC A-Series engine#948|948cc]] (57.9 cu in) variant of the [[BMC A-Series engine]], elevating top speed from 63&nbsp;mph to 75&nbsp;mph, and reducing 0-60&nbsp;mph acceleration from 52.5 secs to 31.3 secs.<ref>http://www.gbclassiccars.co.uk/morris_minor.html</ref> Driving was further improved by a substantially revised gearbox, which incorporated taller ratios for more relaxed cruising speeds and a remote selector allowing a shorter gear lever and less ponderous gearchange action. This new engine and gearbox was the product of a broader engine policy at BMC, and had been developed for use in a range of their smaller vehicles, including the [[Austin A35]], [[Austin A40 Farina|A40 Farina]], and [[Austin-Healey Sprite]]/[[MG Midget]], to maximise parts sharing and thus reduce production costs, servicing costs and consumer costs across the model range.\n\nA series of changes to the body pressings for the roof/scuttle and bonnet panels yielded a large wraparound rear windscreen and one-piece curved front windscreen, which markedly improved visibility and lent a modernised appearance to the car at relatively small outlay.\n\nMany of the 'luxury' items, such as leather trim, were replaced with more durable and cheaper materials, and over the course of the following years the range of available paint and interior colours was dramatically reduced. Various unique Minor trim items and components (such as light units and heaters) were also gradually replaced with ubiquitous items from the BMC range. This programme of changes succeeded in giving access to improved economies of scale to allow production to be ramped up. By the turn of the 1960s, over 100,000 Minors were being produced per year, compared to fewer than 50,000 per year a decade earlier.<ref name=\"morrisminorspares.com\">http://www.morrisminorspares.com/production-figures-i19</ref>\n\nIn 1961 the [[flag semaphore|semaphore]]-style [[trafficators]] were replaced by [[Turn signal|flashing direction indicators]]. These were US-style red at the rear (using the same bulb filament as the brake lamp) and white at the front (using a second brighter filament in the parking lamp bulb) which was legal in the UK and many export markets at the time (such as New Zealand). On the two door cars, the rear wings were modified to remove the openings for the trafficators; on the 4-door, the B-pillar pressing was modified to leave a \u2018blank\u2019 in place of the trafficator housing.\n\nAn upmarket car based on the Minor floorpan using the larger [[BMC B-Series engine]] was sold as the [[Riley One-Point-Five]]/Wolseley 1500 beginning in 1957: versions of this Wolseley/Riley variant were also produced by [[BMC Australia]] as the [[Morris Major]] and the [[Austin Lancer]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\n1960 Morris Minor 1000 2-door sedan (26676151933).jpg|Morris Minor 1000 2-door saloon\n1962 Morris Minor 1000 sedan (18823882102).jpg|Morris Minor 1000 4-door saloon\nMorris Minor 1000 01.JPG|Morris Minor 1000 Convertible\nTraveller (4196830669).jpg|Morris Minor 1000 Traveller<br>(registered February 1966)\nMorris Minor Emblem.jpg|Morris Minor bonnet ornament\nMM1000 4DS 1956 06 innen 2005.jpg|Interior\n</gallery>\n{{clear_left}}\n\n===Minor Million===\nIn December 1960 the Morris Minor became the first British car to sell more than 1,000,000 units. To commemorate the achievement, a limited edition of 350 two-door Minor saloons (one for each UK Morris dealership) was produced with distinctive lilac paintwork and a white interior. Also the badge name on the side of the bonnet was modified to read \"Minor 1,000,000\" instead of the standard \"Minor 1000\". The millionth Minor was donated to the [[National Union of Journalists]], which planned to use it as a prize in a competition in aid of the union's Widow and Orphan Fund. The company, at the same time, presented a celebratory Minor to London's [[Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children]], but this car was constructed of cake.<ref name = PracticalMotorist196103>{{cite journal |title=News Summary: Morris Minor Million |journal=Practical Motorist |volume=7 |number=79 |page=713 |date=March 1961}}</ref>\n\n===Series V (ADO59)===\nThe final major upgrades to the Minor were made in 1962. Although the name ''Minor 1000'' was retained, the changes were sufficient for the new model to be given its own [[British Motor Corporation#BMC project numbers|ADO development number]]. Morris chassis numbering convention refers to these cars as 'Series V', the 'Series IV' designation having been assigned to the [[Mini#Mark I Mini: 1959\u201367|Morris Mini Minor]].<ref name=\"potteries.mmoc.org.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://potteries.mmoc.org.uk/Identify.htm|title=Welcome to the Website for the Potteries branch of the Morris Minor Owners Club|website=potteries.mmoc.org.uk|access-date=13 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nA new, larger version of the existing [[BMC A-Series engine#1098|A-Series]] engine had been developed in conjunction with cylinder head specialist [[Weslake|Harry Weslake]] for the then new [[BMC ADO16|ADO16]] Austin/Morris 1100 range. This new engine used a taller block than the 948&nbsp;cc unit, with increased bore and stroke bringing total capacity up to 1,098&nbsp;cc. Although fuel consumption suffered moderately at 38&nbsp;mpg, the Minor's top speed increased to 77&nbsp;mph (124&nbsp;km/h), and a 20% increase in torque<ref name=\"potteries.mmoc.org.uk\"/> gave an altogether more responsive drive. The revised engine was teamed to a stronger gearbox fitted with [[Manual transmission#Synchromesh|baulk ring synchromesh]] replacing the previous cone-clutch type. Drum brakes were retained on each corner, but the front units were increased from 7 inches (18&nbsp;cm) to 8 inches (20&nbsp;cm) in diameter. Other changes included a modified dashboard with toggle switches, white-on-black speedometer unit (incorporating a warning light for a blocked oil filter), textured alloy fascia, and a new glove-box cover design (a fully enclosing bottom-hinged cover on the passenger side, and fixed open aperture surround on the driver's side). A two-spoke 'safety' steering wheel (shared with the [[BMC ADO16|Morris 1100]]) and new heater (now with fresh air ventilation) were fitted in 1964, completing the interior upgrade. Larger combined front side/indicator light units, common to many [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] vehicles of the time, were fitted to the front wings, and larger tail lamp units were fitted at the rear. Both incorporated separate amber flashers for directional indicators.\n\nFrom 1965, no further production improvements were made to the Minor,<ref>http://mmoc-ni.co.uk/2012/12/03/minor-history/</ref> with resource being channelled into improving the [[BMC ADO16|ADO16]] (the Minor's spiritual successor and Britain's best-selling car in the 1960s), and development of the [[Morris Marina]], which would succeed the Minor on the Cowley production lines in 1971.\n\nIn 1969, production of the Traveller variants was moved to the ex-[[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] plant at [[Adderley Park]], where the van and pick-up models were already made. This freed up production space at [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] and simplified the production chain as the Traveller's rear bodies were built at the Morris Bodies factory in [[Coventry]]. Adderley Park-built Travellers were offered in a new range of colours from the paint range that had been introduced for 1970, including vibrant shades such as Limeflower ([[lime green]]) and Aqua ([[turquoise]]). From 1971 Minors were fitted with a steering-column mounted ignition key and a steering lock rather than the facia-mounted ignition switch used up to that point.\n\n;Engines\n*1956\u201362 (Series III): 948 cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine#948|A-series]]'' [[Inline-four engine|inline-four]], 37&nbsp;bhp (28&nbsp;kW) at 4,750&nbsp;rpm and 50&nbsp;lb/ft (68&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 2,500&nbsp;rpm\n*1962\u201372 (Series V): 1,098 cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine#1098|A-series]]'' inline-four, 48&nbsp;bhp (36&nbsp;kW) at 5,100&nbsp;rpm and 60&nbsp;lb/ft (81&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 2,500&nbsp;rpm<ref name=\"potteries.mmoc.org.uk\"/>\n\n==Decline and replacement==\nDuring the life of the Minor 1000 model, production declined &ndash; as the [[Mini]] and [[BMC ADO16|1100/1300]] had become BMC's best selling models by the mid 1960s.\n\nThe last Convertible/Tourer was manufactured on 18 August 1969,<ref name =Motor196908>{{Cite journal | authorlink = Charles Bulmer (Ed)| title = News: Last Minor Convertible sold | journal = [[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]| volume = 3506| page = 52 |date = 30 August 1969}}</ref> and the saloon models were discontinued in November 1970. Production of the more practical Traveller and commercial versions ceased in April 1971. According to Newell (1997), 1.6 million&nbsp;Minors were made in total and Wainwright (2008) even claims that 1,619,857 Minors of all variants were ultimately sold.<ref>[https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/morris/minor/]</ref>\n\n===The Minor vs Volkswagen===\nThe decline and cancellation of Minor production was source of some consternation by industry commentators in the late 1960s,<ref name=\"Cowin, Chris 2012\">Cowin, Chris (2012), ''British Leyland: Chronicle of a Car Crash'' ({{ISBN|9781477560679}}) p.57</ref> who believed that further development of the car had the potential to challenge the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] in export markets. The Volkswagen, which was developed as a small family car with a very similar brief to the Minor, had been upgraded consistently over 25 years, and retained a healthy market share in export markets (especially developing countries), where it was very often the lowest priced new car on the market.<ref>Howard, Tony (December 1976). \"New VWs reflect determinedly cheerful mood\". SA Motor. Cape Town, South Africa: Scott Publications: 31\u201332.</ref> It went on to achieve over 21 million units before cancellation in 2003. Having said this, in the year of the Minor's cancellation (1971), over 1.3 million Beetles were produced (its peak year of production).<ref>https://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/beetle_productionfigures.php</ref> This corresponded to over 80% of total Minor production in 23 years, or ten times the production volume of Minors in their peak year (1958) when 113,699 were built.<ref name=\"morrisminorspares.com\"/> This gulf of production capacity made the Minor's ability to effectively challenge the Beetle, which had a global distributor and servicing network, moot. Some historians also report that the Minor was being sold at a loss during its final years.<ref name=\"Cowin, Chris 2012\"/> British Leyland management were pinning hopes for greater market share and profitability on the Morris Marina, which was being specifically developed for assembly on the Minor production lines at Cowley, thereby precluding the continuance of Minor production in any event.\n\n===Successors===\nThe Minor was officially replaced on the Cowley production lines by the [[Morris Marina]] (ADO28), which was developed primarily in response to Ford's top-selling (and in many respects, conservatively engineered) [[Ford Escort (Europe)#First generation (1967\u20131975)|Escort]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/2011/07/21/the-cars-bmc-18002200-development-history/ |title=The cars: BMC 1800/2200 development history |publisher=AROnline |date=11 April 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002180934/http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/2011/07/21/the-cars-bmc-18002200-development-history/ |archive-date=2 October 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Building a larger mid-sized car capable of volume sales (particularly in the lucrative fleet-buying market) was becoming increasingly key in maintaining healthy sales figures, and was an issue BMC had consistently failed to address hitherto.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/morris/marina-ital/morris-marina-development-history/ |title=The cars : Morris Marina development story |publisher=AROnline |date=19 December 2017 |accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> The Marina was developed under the watchful eye of [[British Leyland]] management, and used a modified version of the Minor chassis floorplan, extended to increase the wheelbase by  10 inches. Many other Minor components, including much of the suspension, were used in the running gear, which served to streamline production changeover and minimise the financial outlay associated with chassis development and retooling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/2011/09/03/the-cars-morris-marinaital-development-history/ |title=The cars: Morris Marina/Ital development history |publisher=AROnline |date=11 April 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415102601/http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/2011/09/03/the-cars-morris-marinaital-development-history/ |archivedate=15 April 2012  }}</ref>\n\nThe spiritual successor to the Morris Minor was arguably the [[BMC ADO16|ADO16]] Austin/Morris 1100 range, which had been launched in 1962 and aimed at the same small family-car market (and actually replaced the Minor in some export markets such as Australia and New Zealand). The crisp styling, hydrolastic suspension and innovative front-wheel drive system (itself a \"scaling-up\" of the [[Mini]] principle) made ADO16 a worthy successor to the (in its day) strikingly forward-looking Minor. However, due to the British Motor Corporation's commitment to both the Morris factory at [[Plant Oxford|Cowley]], and [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] plant at [[Longbridge plant|Longbridge]]&nbsp;\u2013 in addition to a healthy demand for both products&nbsp;\u2013 production of the two cars continued in parallel for nearly 10 years. Indeed, production of ADO16 outlasted that of the Minor by only three years or so, before being replaced by the innovative, export-oriented, yet under-developed [[Austin Allegro]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/2011/08/27/the-cars-austin-allegro-development-history/ |title=Austin Allegro |publisher=AROnline |date=11 April 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531075600/http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/2011/08/27/the-cars-austin-allegro-development-history/ |archivedate=31 May 2012  }}</ref>\n\n==Safety==\nDespite the four major updates of the Minor in its 23-year production run, very few actively designed \"safety features\" were ever engineered into the Minor's design. Provisions were made for seat belt fittings in the early '60s, but the rigid structure of the car's monocoque body made it dangerously unabsorbent to impact.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} For a short time in 1968, the thickness of the steel used in the bonnet and doors was decreased from 1.2&nbsp;mm to 1.0&nbsp;mm to act as a form of [[crumple zone]], but as the wings continued to be made of 1.4&nbsp;mm mild steel, the modification was pointless and ineffectual and was reversed in 1969 as it increased passenger compartment crush in collisions.\n\nThe Mark II model changed from the \"lowlight\" model to comply with Canadian lighting standards, with higher and brighter headlights to increase visibility in fog and during dark Canadian winters.\n\nAustralian models, and tourer models made in Britain and exported to Australia, featured safety glass windscreens and safety glass windows, to comply with local regulations. Australian models also had blinking indicator lights in addition to the standard trafficator arms on the indigenous Minor 1000.\n\n==Morris quarter ton van and pick-up==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | name       = Morris Quarter Ton Van & Pick-up\n | aka = {{Plainlist|\n*Morris 6cwt/8cwt Van & Pick up\n*Austin 6cwt/8cwt Van & Pick up\n }}\n | image      = File:Morris 6 Cwt Van - Flickr - exfordy.jpg\n | caption    = Morris 6cwt Van\n | production = 1953\u201373<ref name=Newell/>\n | assembly = {{Plainlist|\n*England\n*Australia<ref name=Anderson />\n*New Zealand<ref name=Newell />\n*Denmark<ref name=Newell />\n }}\n | engine = {{Plainlist|\n*803&nbsp;cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<ref name=Newell />\n*948&nbsp;cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<ref name=Newell />\n*1,098&nbsp;cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine#1098|A-series]]'' I4<ref name=Newell />\n }}\n | body_style = {{Plainlist|\n*2-door [[van]]\n*2-door [[Pickup truck|pickup]]\n }}\n}}\nClosed van and open flat-bed (\"pick-up\") versions of the Minor were built from 1953 until the end of production. They were designed for commercial use with small businesses, although many were also used by larger corporations. Van versions were popular with the [[General Post Office]], the early versions of these (to around 1956) having rubber front wings to cope with the sometimes unforgiving busy situations in which they were expected to work. Both the van and the pickup differed from the monocoque construction of the Saloon and Traveller variants by having a separate chassis. They also differed in details such as telescopic rear dampers, stiffer rear leaf springs and lower-ratio differentials to cope with heavier loads.\n\nThe commercial versions were initially marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up, with a Series III designation applied from 1956.<ref name=Newell/> The names Morris 6cwt Van and Pickup was used following the introduction of the 1098cc engine in 1962<ref name=Newell/> and 8cwt versions were added in 1968.<ref name=Newell/><ref>A [[Hundredweight|Cwt]] was the short-form term for a \"hundredweight\" which was a pre-metric unit of weight measurement used in Britain, equivalent to about 50&nbsp;kg.  Use of the term in the name of a light commercial vehicle was common in Britain, and indicated the maximum load (by weight) that the van was designed to carry.</ref>\n\nAs BMC's policy was to provide both Austin and Morris with complete commercial vehicle ranges, Austin-badged variants of the Minor van and pick-up were sold following the end of [[Austin A35]] production in 1968. These featured Austin badging and the corporate Austin 'crinkle-cut' radiator grille but were otherwise identical to the standard Minor commercials, and were sold as the Austin 6cwt and Austin 8cwt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/commercials/ar-commercials-car-derived-vanspick-ups/ |title=Morris \u00bc-ton (O-Type) 1953\u20131971 |publisher=www.aronline.co.uk |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref> <gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:1962 Morris Minor 1000 pickup.jpg|1962 Morris 6cwt pick up\nFile:Austin 6cwt Van, pic1.JPG|Austin 6cwt Van\n1965 Morris 6CWT Van (11815570686).jpg|Morris 6cwt van\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Morris Minor today==\n[[File:Morrisrally.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|Morris Minor rally at [[Brooklands]], Surrey]]\n\nToday the Morris Minor and 1000 are among the best-served classic family-sized cars in the old vehicle movement and continue to gain popularity. The enduring affection for the \"Moggie\" (also a common British nickname for an undistinguished cat, or a [[Morgan Motor Company|Morgan]]) or \"Morrie\" (as it is often known in Australia and New Zealand) is reflected in the number of restored and improved Morris Minors currently running in Britain and [[Australasia]]. In addition to more powerful engines, desirable improvements necessitated by the increase in traffic density since the Minor was withdrawn from volume production include the replacement of the original equipment drum brakes with [[disc brake|discs]]. Other important upgrades include the {{convert|1275|cc|cid|abbr=on}} version of the [[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]] engine, derided by [[Morris Marina]] enthusiasts as a key reason why many Marinas were scrapped, and the similarly sized [[Nissan A engine]], which shares all common dimensions to the Morris Minor engine, except piston size. ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]] once stated that the Morris Minor is Britain's [[Volkswagen Beetle]] (although this was meant in a derogatory way rather than favourably). There is still an extensive parts backup for these cars, and parts are cheap compared to modern day cars.\n\nReplacement panels for the Morris Minor were still being made in 2002 by the [[Durable Car Company]] in [[Sri Lanka]].\n\n==References==\nCharles Smith (1994) \u2018\u2019Economic Development, Growth and Welfare\u2019\u2019, p. 93, box 6.2, London, Palgrave, 978-0-333-59268-7\nMorris Minor Centre page on DCC: https://www.morrisminor.org.uk/62-sri-lanka\n\u2018\u2019Daily Telegraph\u2019\u2019 article by Paul Jeffries, 17 Oct 2013: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/classiccars/10372863/Morris-Minor-still-big-in-Sri-Lanka.html\n\u2018\u2019The Businessman, The Buddhist and the Morris Minor\u2019\u2019, film on development of Durable Car Company: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIFRr71Z7OI\n]] in Sri Lanka.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2492607.stm |title=2002 BBC article about the company and Morris Minor |publisher=BBC News |date=19 November 2002 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Newell, Ray (1997), ''Original Morris Minor'' (Bay View Books Ltd, Bideford, Devon, {{ISBN|1-870979-43-5}})\n*Wainwright, Martin (2008), ''Morris Minor \u2013 The Biography'' (Aurum Press, {{ISBN|978-1-84513-378-8}})\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.morrisdownunder.com/forum/index.php \u2013 Morris Minor community forum\n*http://MORRISMINOR.US \u2013 Morris Minor Registry of North America\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{dmoz|/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models/Morris/|Morris}}\n\n{{Automobiles made by BMC, BL and Rover Group companies, post-1945}}\n{{British Motor Holdings and British Leyland cars, 1966-1986}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[Category:Morris vehicles|Minor]]\n[[Category:Issigonis vehicles]]\n[[Category:1940s cars]]\n[[Category:Subcompact cars]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:Vans]]\n[[Category:Pickup trucks]]\n[[Category:1950s cars]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1948]]\n", "name_user": "TobyJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:delete mistaen addition", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Minor"}
