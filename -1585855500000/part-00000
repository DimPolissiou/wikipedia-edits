La Sindrome di Stendhal)'' is a 1996 Italian [[horror film|horror]] film written and directed by [[Dario Argento]] and starring his daughter [[Asia Argento]]. It was the first Italian film to use [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117658/trivia |title=The Stendhal Syndrome |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Stendhal syndrome]] is considered a real syndrome by some, first diagnosed in [[Florence]], Italy in 1982. Argento said he experienced Stendhal syndrome as a child. While touring Athens with his parents young Dario was climbing the steps of the Parthenon when he was overcome by a trance that caused him to become lost from his parents for hours. The experience was so strong that Argento never forgot it; he immediately thought of it when he came across [[Graziella Magherini]]'s book about the syndrome, which would become the basis of the film.\n\nIt was a [[box office]] hit when released in Italy, grossing \u20a45,443,000,000 [[Italian lira]] ([[United States dollar|US]] $3,809,977).\n\n== Plot ==\n\nDetective Anna Manni travels to [[Florence]] on the trail of a [[serial killer]], Alfredo Grossi. While visiting a museum, Anna is overcome by [[Stendhal syndrome]], a condition which causes the sufferer to become overwhelmed when viewing great works of art. When Alfredo learns of Anna's disorder, he uses it to disable her before he kidnaps her and subjects her to a brutal and sadistic sexual attack. Although she manages to escape, Anna is left deeply [[psychological trauma|traumatized]]. Alfredo continues to track her movements and is able to capture her again. This time, however, Anna turns the tables on her abductor, breaking free of his grasp, badly wounding him in the process, and knocking him into a river.\n\nWhile the police, believing Alfredo to be dead, search the river for his body, Anna meets and soon falls in love with Marie, a young French art student. Anna also takes sessions with a psychologist in an effort to come to terms with her own deep-seated emotional trauma. That trauma is intensified when Anna begins to receive phone calls from the supposedly-dead Alfredo. When Marie is found murdered, Anna's psychologist, concerned about her mental state, visits her at home. While he is there, a colleague of Anna's, Marco, calls to notify her that Alfredo's body has in fact been found. This leads to the psychologist realizing the truth, and he confronts Anna with the reality that she herself is Marie's murderer. Marco arrives at Anna's apartment, only to find that she has killed her psychologist as well. As he attempts to take Anna's gun from her, she confesses that Alfredo is now inside her, ordering her to do terrible things, whereupon she murders Marco. The police arrive on the scene and ultimately arrest her after she wanders the streets.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Asia Argento]] as Det. Anna Manni\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Alfredo Grossi\n* [[Marco Leonardi]] as Marco Longhi\n* [[Luigi Diberti]] as Insp. Manetti\n* [[Paolo Bonacelli]] as Dr. Cavanna\n* Julien Lambroschini as Marie Beyle\n* John Quentin as Mr. Manni\n* [[Franco Diogene]] as Victim's husband\n* Lucia Stara as the Shop assistant\n* Sonia Topazio as Victim in Florence\n* [[Lorenzo Crespi]] as Giulio\n* Vera Gemma as the Policewoman\n* John Pedeferri as Hydraulic engineer\n* [[Veronica Lazar]] as Mrs. Beyle\n* Mario Diano as the Coroner\n*[[Cinzia Monreale]] as Mrs. Grossi\n* Eleonora Vizzini as Anna Manni (child)\n\n== Production ==\nUpon release, the alternate title was The Strendahl System. Asia Argento, can you verify this?\n\n[[Bridget Fonda]] was originally set to star in the role of Anna, but dropped out before the start of production, and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] was considered as a possible replacement before Dario Argento eventually cast his own daughter, Asia, in the role.<ref>Jones, Alan. ''Profondo Argento: The Man, the Myths & the Magic'' (FAB Press, 2004), p. 229. {{ISBN|190325423X}}.</ref> [[Thomas Kretschmann]] was cast as Alfredo Grossi because he had previously worked with Asia on the film ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' (1994) and she recommended him to her father.<ref>Jones, Alan. ''Profondo Argento: The Man, the Myths & the Magic''. (FAB Press, 2004), p. 231. {{ISBN|190325423X}}.</ref>\n\nThe opening scene was shot in [[Florence]] at Italy's famed [[Uffizi Gallery]]. Dario Argento is the only director ever granted permission to shoot there.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} \n\nThe work that Anna literally steps into is a painting by [[Rembrandt]], depicting 17th century policemen and titled ''[[The Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]''. The painting that causes Anna to faint in the museum is ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]].\n\nThe footage of Anna underwater after she faints in the gallery was shot in the sea.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The huge grouper fish that Anna kisses was a remote model that was being pulled through the water by cables attached to a small float on the ocean's surface.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Mere moments after wrapping the underwater shoot, the fish stopped working.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThis would be the last fiction feature film for acclaimed director of photography [[Giuseppe Rotunno]]. The following year he shot a documentary on [[Marcello Mastroianni]] before retiring.\n\nGraffiti artists were brought in to cover the walls of Alfredo's underground lair with graffiti. In one night the group created over one hundred square feet of graffiti-covered walls at the location.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThis is the second of (to date) five films in which Argento has directed his daughter, Asia, the four others being: ''[[Trauma (1993 film)|Trauma]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1998 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' and ''[[Dracula 3D]]''. She also had roles in ''[[Demons 2]]'' and ''[[The Church (1989 film)|The Church]]'', both of which her father produced.\n\nArgento planned on making a sequel to ''The Stendhal Syndrome'' which would follow detective Anna Manni on another case. However, Asia was unavailable so the character's name was changed (to Anna Mari) and [[Stefania Rocca]] was cast. The resulting film is 2004's ''[[The Card Player]]''.\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n\nThe film carries a 77% 'Fresh' rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 13 reviews<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stendhal_syndrome/ |title=The Stendhal Syndrome - Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref> indicating positive reviews, and was nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Home Video Release.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117658/awards?ref_=tt_awd |title=The Stendhal Syndrome - Awards |accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nResponse from critics was mixed, with ''[[AllRovi|AllMovie]]''{{'}}s Jason Buchanan calling the film \"a sadistic and disturbing psychological exploration\", but one that is \"ultimately a victim of its own excess and the director's tendency to overcomplicate a fairly simple storyline.\" Buchanan praised the film's \"stunningly visual opening sequence\" and [[Ennio Morricone]]'s \"hauntingly hypnotic score\" but criticized how \"the seemingly meandering plot grinds to a halt just as it should truly shine.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-stendhal-syndrome-v135853/review |title=The Stendhal Syndrome - Review - AllMovie |last=Buchanan |first=Jason |work=[[AllRovi|AllMovie]] |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s David Rooney gave the film a mixed review, praising the film's \"exhilarating\" opening sequence and Giuseppe Rotunno's \"cool and elegant\" cinematography, but lamented that \"[a]s with much of the director\u2019s work, large sections of plot are pure hokum, and the gradual slackening of both pace and suspense in a sluggish second half only underlines the increasing silliness.\"<ref name=Rooney>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/the-stendhal-syndrome-1200445110/ |title=Review: 'The Stendhal Syndrome' |accessdate=20 September 2016 |author=Rooney, David |date=4 February 1996 |work=Variety }}</ref>\n\n[[Maitland McDonagh]] gave a mostly positive review, writing that \"this isn't a return to the baroque heights of ''[[Opera (film)|Opera]]'' and ''[[Tenebrae (film)|Tenebrae]]''. But it's a must-see for Argento completists, driven by a brave and disturbing performance by the director's daughter, Asia\", though she criticized the film for taking \"a serious wrong turn around the time Anna buys a blond, femme-fatale wig.\"<ref name=McDonagh>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-stendhal-syndrome/review/132133/ |title=The Stendhal Syndrome - Review |accessdate=20 September 2016 |author=McDonagh, Maitland |work=TV Guide }}</ref>\n\n=== Home video ===\n\nIn the U.S., ''The Stendhal Syndrome'' is distributed by [[B movie]] company [[Troma Entertainment]]. A new special edition [[DVD]] of the film was released by [[Blue Underground]] on 30 August 2007.\n\nFor its initial release in the United Kingdom, eleven cuts, primarily to the rape scenes, violence and some dialogue, totaling 2 minutes 47 seconds were made by the distributor before submission to the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] for a video certificate. The 2005 UK DVD release, by Arrow Pictures, had all previous cuts waived and represents the full-length English version, although like all English releases it omits the two scenes exclusive to the Italian version.

La Sindrome di Stendhal)'' is a 1996 Italian [[horror film|horror]] film written and directed by [[Dario Argento]] and starring his daughter [[Asia Argento]]. It was the first Italian film to use [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117658/trivia |title=The Stendhal Syndrome |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Stendhal syndrome]] is considered a real syndrome by some, first diagnosed in [[Florence]], Italy in 1982. Argento said he experienced Stendhal syndrome as a child. While touring Athens with his parents young Dario was climbing the steps of the Parthenon when he was overcome by a trance that caused him to become lost from his parents for hours. The experience was so strong that Argento never forgot it; he immediately thought of it when he came across [[Graziella Magherini]]'s book about the syndrome, which would become the basis of the film.\n\nIt was a [[box office]] hit when released in Italy, grossing \u20a45,443,000,000 [[Italian lira]] ([[United States dollar|US]] $3,809,977).\n\n== Plot ==\n\nDetective Anna Manni travels to [[Florence]] on the trail of a [[serial killer]], Alfredo Grossi. While visiting a museum, Anna is overcome by [[Stendhal syndrome]], a condition which causes the sufferer to become overwhelmed when viewing great works of art. When Alfredo learns of Anna's disorder, he uses it to disable her before he kidnaps her and subjects her to a brutal and sadistic sexual attack. Although she manages to escape, Anna is left deeply [[psychological trauma|traumatized]]. Alfredo continues to track her movements and is able to capture her again. This time, however, Anna turns the tables on her abductor, breaking free of his grasp, badly wounding him in the process, and knocking him into a river.\n\nWhile the police, believing Alfredo to be dead, search the river for his body, Anna meets and soon falls in love with Marie, a young French art student. Anna also takes sessions with a psychologist in an effort to come to terms with her own deep-seated emotional trauma. That trauma is intensified when Anna begins to receive phone calls from the supposedly-dead Alfredo. When Marie is found murdered, Anna's psychologist, concerned about her mental state, visits her at home. While he is there, a colleague of Anna's, Marco, calls to notify her that Alfredo's body has in fact been found. This leads to the psychologist realizing the truth, and he confronts Anna with the reality that she herself is Marie's murderer. Marco arrives at Anna's apartment, only to find that she has killed her psychologist as well. As he attempts to take Anna's gun from her, she confesses that Alfredo is now inside her, ordering her to do terrible things, whereupon she murders Marco. The police arrive on the scene and ultimately arrest her after she wanders the streets.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Asia Argento]] as Det. Anna Manni\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Alfredo Grossi\n* [[Marco Leonardi]] as Marco Longhi\n* [[Luigi Diberti]] as Insp. Manetti\n* [[Paolo Bonacelli]] as Dr. Cavanna\n* Julien Lambroschini as Marie Beyle\n* John Quentin as Mr. Manni\n* [[Franco Diogene]] as Victim's husband\n* Lucia Stara as the Shop assistant\n* Sonia Topazio as Victim in Florence\n* [[Lorenzo Crespi]] as Giulio\n* Vera Gemma as the Policewoman\n* John Pedeferri as Hydraulic engineer\n* [[Veronica Lazar]] as Mrs. Beyle\n* Mario Diano as the Coroner\n*[[Cinzia Monreale]] as Mrs. Grossi\n* Eleonora Vizzini as Anna Manni (child)\n\n== Production ==\nUpon release, the alternate title was The Strendahl System.\n\n[[Bridget Fonda]] was originally set to star in the role of Anna, but dropped out before the start of production, and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] was considered as a possible replacement before Dario Argento eventually cast his own daughter, Asia, in the role.<ref>Jones, Alan. ''Profondo Argento: The Man, the Myths & the Magic'' (FAB Press, 2004), p. 229. {{ISBN|190325423X}}.</ref> [[Thomas Kretschmann]] was cast as Alfredo Grossi because he had previously worked with Asia on the film ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' (1994) and she recommended him to her father.<ref>Jones, Alan.

Dario Argento is the only director ever granted permission to shoot there.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} \n\nThe work that Anna literally steps into is a painting by [[Rembrandt]], depicting 17th century policemen and titled ''[[The Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]''. The painting that causes Anna to faint in the museum is ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]].\n\nThe footage of Anna underwater after she faints in the gallery was shot in the sea.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The huge grouper fish that Anna kisses was a remote model that was being pulled through the water by cables attached to a small float on the ocean's surface.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Mere moments after wrapping the underwater shoot, the fish stopped working.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThis would be the last fiction feature film for acclaimed director of photography [[Giuseppe Rotunno]]. The following year he shot a documentary on [[Marcello Mastroianni]] before retiring.\n\nGraffiti artists were brought in to cover the walls of Alfredo's underground lair with graffiti. In one night the group created over one hundred square feet of graffiti-covered walls at the location.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThis is the second of (to date) five films in which Argento has directed his daughter, Asia, the four others being: ''[[Trauma (1993 film)|Trauma]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1998 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' and ''[[Dracula 3D]]''. She also had roles in ''[[Demons 2]]'' and ''[[The Church (1989 film)|The Church]]'', both of which her father produced.\n\nArgento planned on making a sequel to ''The Stendhal Syndrome'' which would follow detective Anna Manni on another case. However, Asia was unavailable so the character's name was changed (to Anna Mari) and [[Stefania Rocca]] was cast. The resulting film is 2004's ''[[The Card Player]]''.\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n\nThe film carries a 77% 'Fresh' rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 13 reviews<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stendhal_syndrome/ |title=The Stendhal Syndrome - Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref> indicating positive reviews, and was nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Home Video Release.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117658/awards?ref_=tt_awd |title=The Stendhal Syndrome - Awards |accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nResponse from critics was mixed, with ''[[AllRovi|AllMovie]]''{{'}}s Jason Buchanan calling the film \"a sadistic and disturbing psychological exploration\", but one that is \"ultimately a victim of its own excess and the director's tendency to overcomplicate a fairly simple storyline.\" Buchanan praised the film's \"stunningly visual opening sequence\" and [[Ennio Morricone]]'s \"hauntingly hypnotic score\" but criticized how \"the seemingly meandering plot grinds to a halt just as it should truly shine.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-stendhal-syndrome-v135853/review |title=The Stendhal Syndrome - Review - AllMovie |last=Buchanan |first=Jason |work=[[AllRovi|AllMovie]] |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s David Rooney gave the film a mixed review, praising the film's \"exhilarating\" opening sequence and Giuseppe Rotunno's \"cool and elegant\" cinematography, but lamented that \"[a]s with much of the director\u2019s work, large sections of plot are pure hokum, and the gradual slackening of both pace and suspense in a sluggish second half only underlines the increasing silliness.\"<ref name=Rooney>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/the-stendhal-syndrome-1200445110/ |title=Review: 'The Stendhal Syndrome' |accessdate=20 September 2016 |author=Rooney, David |date=4 February 1996 |work=Variety }}</ref>\n\n[[Maitland McDonagh]] gave a mostly positive review, writing that \"this isn't a return to the baroque heights of ''[[Opera (film)|Opera]]'' and ''[[Tenebrae (film)|Tenebrae]]''.

He also worked several times with [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and is a significant figure of the [[French New Wave]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn in Paris, L\u00e9aud made his major debut as an actor at the age of 14 as [[Antoine Doinel]], a semi-autobiographical character based on the life events of French [[film director]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], in ''[[The 400 Blows]]''. To cast the two adolescents, Truffaut published an announcement in ''[[France-Soir]]'' and auditioned several hundred children in September and October 1958. Jean Domarchi, a critic at ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', had earlier recommended the son of an assistant scriptwriter, Pierre L\u00e9aud, and the actress [[Jacqueline Pierreux]].\n\nTruffaut was immediately captivated by the fourteen-year-old adolescent,<ref name=\"BaecqueToubiana2000\">{{cite book\n|last1=Baecque\n|first1=Antoine de\n|last2=Toubiana\n|first2=Serge\n|title=Truffaut\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2H0AiDn4XIC&pg=PA129\n|accessdate=29 March 2011\n|date=4 September 2000\n|publisher=University of California Press\n|isbn=978-0-520-22524-4\n|page=129}}</ref> who had already appeared with [[Jean Marais]] in [[Georges Lampin]]'s ''[[La Tour, prends garde !]]'' (1958). He recognized traits they both shared, \"for example a certain suffering with regard to the family...With, however, this fundamental difference: though we were both rebels, we hadn't expressed our rebellion in the same way. I preferred to cover up and lie. Jean-Pierre, on the contrary, seeks to hurt, shock and wants it to be known...Why? Because he's unruly, while I was sly. Because his excitability requires that things happen to him, and when they don't occur quickly enough, he provokes them\".<ref name=\"BaecqueToubiana2000\"/>{{rp|129}} In his final interview, Truffaut mentioned he was happy with how L\u00e9aud improvised within the flexibly written script.<ref name=\"Brody2010\">{{cite web|last1=Brody|first1=Richard|title=Truffaut's Last Interview|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/truffauts-last-interview|website=The New Yorker|publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast|accessdate=29 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nJean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, then in the eighth grade at a private school in Pontigny, was a far from ideal student. The director of the school wrote this to Truffaut, \"I regret to inform you that Jean-Pierre is more and more 'unmanageable'. Indifference, arrogance, permanent defiance, lack of discipline in all its forms. He has twice been caught leafing through pornographic pictures in the dorm.

To cast the two adolescents, Truffaut published an announcement in ''[[France-Soir]]'' and auditioned several hundred children in September and October 1958. Jean Domarchi, a critic at ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', had earlier recommended the son of an assistant scriptwriter, Pierre L\u00e9aud, and the actress [[Jacqueline Pierreux]].\n\nTruffaut was immediately captivated by the fourteen-year-old adolescent,<ref name=\"BaecqueToubiana2000\">{{cite book\n|last1=Baecque\n|first1=Antoine de\n|last2=Toubiana\n|first2=Serge\n|title=Truffaut\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2H0AiDn4XIC&pg=PA129\n|accessdate=29 March 2011\n|date=4 September 2000\n|publisher=University of California Press\n|isbn=978-0-520-22524-4\n|page=129}}</ref> who had already appeared with [[Jean Marais]] in [[Georges Lampin]]'s ''[[La Tour, prends garde !]]'' (1958). He recognized traits they both shared, \"for example a certain suffering with regard to the family...With, however, this fundamental difference: though we were both rebels, we hadn't expressed our rebellion in the same way. I preferred to cover up and lie. Jean-Pierre, on the contrary, seeks to hurt, shock and wants it to be known...Why? Because he's unruly, while I was sly. Because his excitability requires that things happen to him, and when they don't occur quickly enough, he provokes them\".<ref name=\"BaecqueToubiana2000\"/>{{rp|129}} In his final interview, Truffaut mentioned he was happy with how L\u00e9aud improvised within the flexibly written script.<ref name=\"Brody2010\">{{cite web|last1=Brody|first1=Richard|title=Truffaut's Last Interview|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/truffauts-last-interview|website=The New Yorker|publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast|accessdate=29 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nJean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, then in the eighth grade at a private school in Pontigny, was a far from ideal student. The director of the school wrote this to Truffaut, \"I regret to inform you that Jean-Pierre is more and more 'unmanageable'.

After being ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] for two centuries, the independent [[Zeta under the Bal\u0161i\u0107i|Principality of Zeta]] emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, ruled by the [[House of Bal\u0161i\u0107]] between 1356 and 1421, and by the [[House of Crnojevi\u0107]] between 1431 and 1498, when the name Montenegro started being used for the country. After falling under [[Montenegro Vilayet|Ottoman rule]], Montenegro regained ''de facto'' independence in 1697 under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], first under the theocratic rule of [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro|prince-bishops]], before being transformed into a secular [[Principality of Montenegro|principality]] in 1852. Montenegro's ''[[de jure]]'' independence was recognised by the [[Great Powers]] at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, following the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War]]. In 1905, the country became a [[Kingdom of Montenegro|kingdom]]. After [[World War I]], it became part of [[Yugoslavia]]. Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the republics of [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]] and [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Montenegro]] together established a federation known as the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was renamed to the [[Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003. On the basis of an [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]] held in May 2006, Montenegro declared independence and the federation peacefully dissolved on 3 June of that year, ending a nearly 88-year union between the two states.<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/serbia-ends-union-with-montenegro-1.785687 Serbia ends union with Montenegro<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSince 1990, the state of Montenegro has been governed by the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] and its minor coalition partners.

The first mention of Montenegro (as Monte nigro) dates to 9 November 1053 in a papal epistle and the others date to 1061, 1097, 1121, 1125, 1144, 1154, 1179 and 1189.<ref name=\"maticacrnogorska\">{{cite web  |title=PRVI POMENI CRNE GORE - Marijan Ma\u0161o Milji\u0107 |url=http://www.maticacrnogorska.me/matica67.html |website=www.maticacrnogorska.me}}</ref>\n\nThe native name ''Crna Gora,'' also meaning \"black mountain,\" came to denote the majority of contemporary Montenegro in the 15th century.<ref name=Fine532>{{harvnb|Fine|1994|p=532}}</ref> Originally, it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the [[Pa\u0161trovi\u0107i]], but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]] took power in [[Upper Zeta]].<ref name=Fine532 /> The aforementioned region became known as ''Stara Crna Gora'' '[[Old Montenegro]]' by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of ''Brda'' '(The) Highlands'. Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]], which saw the annexation of [[Old Herzegovina]] and parts of [[Metohija]] and southern [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]]. Its borders have changed little since then, losing [[Metohija]] and gaining the [[Bay of Kotor]].\n \nAfter the second session of the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|AVNOJ]] during [[World War II in Yugoslavia]], the modern state of Montenegro was founded as the ''[[Federal State of Montenegro]]'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435 / ''Savezna dr\u017eava Crne Gore'') on 15 November 1943 within the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] by the [[State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Montenegro and Boka|ZAVNOCGB]].

After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), several civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, [[Mihailo I of Duklja|Mihailo]] (1046\u201381), and his grandson [[Constantine Bodin]] (1081\u20131101).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970116032145/http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 January 1997 |title=Duklja, the first Montenegrin state |publisher=Montenegro.org |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> \n\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0426\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0430.jpg|thumb|upright|Uprising against the [[Ottoman Empire]], 1878, painted by [[\u0110ura Jak\u0161i\u0107]]]]\nBy the 13th century, ''Zeta'' had replaced ''Duklja'' when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]], then the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora'' ([[Venetian language|Venetian]]: ''{{lang|vec|monte negro}}'').\n\nAs the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, it was conquered by [[Stefan Nemanja]] and incorporated into the [[History of Serbia|Serbian realm]] as a province named Zeta. After the [[Serbian Empire]] collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107]]s, became sovereigns of Zeta.\n\nIn 1421, Zeta was annexed to the [[Serbian Despotate]], but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the [[Crnojevi\u0107]]s, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the [[Ottomans]] in 1496, and got annexed to the ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. During the reign of Crnojevi\u0107s, Zeta became known under its current name&nbsp;\u2013 Montenegro. For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous ''sanjak'' in 1514\u20131528 ([[Sanjak of Montenegro]]).

In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire permitting Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, raised numerous rebellions, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the [[Great Turkish War]] at the end of that century.\n\nMontenegro consisted of territories controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain (''knez''), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. The great assembly of Montenegrin clans (''Zbor'') was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nParts of the territory were controlled by [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[First French Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], its successors. In 1515, Montenegro became a [[theocracy]] led by the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]], which flourished after the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] of Cetinje became the traditional prince-bishops (whose title was \"Vladika of Montenegro\"). However, the [[Venetian Republic]] introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics. The republic was succeeded by the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1797, and the governors were abolished by Prince-Bishop [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II]] in 1832.

However, political rifts emerged between the reigning [[People's Party of Montenegro|People's Party]], who supported the process of democratization and union with Serbia, and those of the [[True People's Party]], who were monarchist.\n\nIn 1858 one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the\n[[Battle of Grahovac]]. [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161|Grand Duke Mirko Petrovi\u0107]], elder brother of [[Knjaz Danilo]], led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans (who had 15,000 troops) at [[Grahovac]] on 1 May 1858. The glory of Montenegrin victory was soon immortalized in the songs and literature of all the South Slavs, in particular the Montenegrins in Vojvodina,{{citation needed|date= June 2019}} then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. This forced the [[Great Powers]] to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, ''de facto'' recognizing Montenegro's independence. The Ottoman Empire recognized Montenegrin independence in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.\n\nThe first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855.\n\n[[File:Kralj i kraljica u krugu sire familije.jpg|thumb|[[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Royal family of Montenegro]]: King [[Nikola I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Nicholas I]] with his wife, sons, daughters, grandchildren and sons- and daughters-in-law]]\n\nIn 1910 Montenegro became [[Kingdom of Montenegro|a kingdom]], and as a result of the [[Balkan wars]] in 1912 and 1913 (in which the Ottomans lost most of their Balkan lands), a common border with Serbia was established, with [[Shkod\u00ebr]] being awarded to a newly-created [[Albania]], though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia.\n\nMontenegro became one of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] during [[World War I]] (1914\u201318). From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro. During the occupation, King Nicholas fled the country and a government-in-exile was set up in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n\nIn 1922, Montenegro formally became the [[Oblast of Cetinje]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], with the addition of the coastal areas around [[Budva]] and [[Bay of Kotor]]. In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger [[Zeta Banovina|Zeta Banate]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] that reached the [[Neretva]] River.\n\nNicholas's grandson, the Serb King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]], dominated the Yugoslav government.

The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for [[guerrilla warfare]].

Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nik\u0161i\u0107), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-185-0116-27A, Bucht von Kotor (-), jugoslawische Schiffe.jpg|thumb|Captured ships of the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|Yugoslavian Navy]], [[Bay of Kotor]] 1941.]]\n[[File:Borbe_za_oslobo\u0111enje_Crne_Gore.jpg|thumb|Liberation of Montenegro in World War II]]\n\nFighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups.

Those loyal to the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]] and opposing communism went on to become [[Chetniks]], and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans.\n\nWar broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of \"anti-communist militia\" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to [[Mostar]], where they fought in the [[Battle of Neretva]] against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.\n\nDuring the German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed large number of Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|occupied by German forces]], and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and entire 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.\n\nMontenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed [[Titograd]] in honour of President [[Josip Broz Tito]]. After the war, the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt, industrialization began, and the [[University of Montenegro]] was established. Greater autonomy was established until the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]] ratified a new constitution in 1974.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== Montenegro within FR Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Serbia and Montenegro|Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)}}\nAfter the dissolution of the SFRY in 1992, Montenegro remained part of a smaller [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] along with Serbia.\n\nIn the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 1992|referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992]], the turnout was 66%, with 96% of the votes cast in favour of the federation with Serbia.

The students may continue their secondary education ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Srednja \u0161kola''), which lasts 4 years (3 years for trade schools) and ends with graduation ([[Matura]]). Higher education lasts with a certain first degree after 3 to 6 years. There is one public university ([[University of Montenegro]]) and two private ones ([[Mediterranean University]] and [[University of Donja Gorica]]).\n\n=== Elementary and secondary education ===\nElementary education in Montenegro is free and compulsory for all the children between the ages of 7 and 15 when children attend the \"eight-year school\".\n\nVarious types of elementary education are available to all who qualify, but the vocational and technical schools (gymnasiums), where the students follow four-year course which will take them up to the university entrance, are the most popular. At the secondary level there are a number of art schools, apprentice schools and teacher training schools. Those who have attended the technical schools may pursue their education further at one of two-year post-secondary schools, created in response to the needs of industry and the social services.\n\nSecondary schools are divided in three types, and children attend one depending on choice and primary school grades:\n\n* [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (Gimnazija / \u0413\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438j\u0430) lasts for four years and offers a general, broad education.

Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Montenegro]] guarantees freedom of speech.\nAs a [[country in transition]], Montenegro's media system is under transformation.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Montenegrin cuisine}}\n[[File:Foods from Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Foods from Montenegro]]\nMontenegrin cuisine is a result of Montenegro's long history. It is a variation of Mediterranean and Oriental. The most influence is from Italy, [[Turkey]], [[Byzantine Empire]]/[[Greece]], and Hungary. Montenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; the cuisine in the coastal area differs from the one in the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of [[Mediterranean cuisine]], with seafood being a common dish, while the northern represents more the Oriental.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Montenegro}}\n[[File:Nikola Vucevic Dec 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107]], a professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Orlando Magic]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] ([[NBA]]).]]\n\nThe '''Sports in Montenegro''' revolves mostly around team sports, such as [[Association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[water polo]], [[volleyball]], and [[Team handball|handball]].

After being ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] for two centuries, the independent [[Zeta under the Bal\u0161i\u0107i|Principality of Zeta]] emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, ruled by the [[House of Bal\u0161i\u0107]] between 1356 and 1421, and by the [[House of Crnojevi\u0107]] between 1431 and 1498, when the name Montenegro started being used for the country. After falling under [[Montenegro Vilayet|Ottoman rule]], Montenegro regained ''de facto'' independence in 1697 under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], first under the theocratic rule of [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro|prince-bishops]], before being transformed into a secular [[Principality of Montenegro|principality]] in 1852. Montenegro's ''[[de jure]]'' independence was recognised by the [[Great Powers]] at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, following the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War]]. In 1905, the country became a [[Kingdom of Montenegro|kingdom]]. After [[World War I]], it became part of [[Yugoslavia]]. Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the republics of [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]] and [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Montenegro]] together established a federation known as the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was renamed to the [[Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003. On the basis of an [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]] held in May 2006, Montenegro declared independence and the federation peacefully dissolved on 3 June of that year, ending a nearly 88-year union between the two states.<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/serbia-ends-union-with-montenegro-1.785687 Serbia ends union with Montenegro<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSince 1990, the state of Montenegro has been governed by the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] and its minor coalition partners. Classified by the [[World Bank]] as an upper middle-income country, Montenegro is a member of the UN, [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]]. It is a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe country's English name derives from [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and translates as \"Black Mountain\", deriving from the appearance of [[Lov\u0107en|Mount Lov\u0107en]] when covered in dense evergreen forests.<ref name=\"visit-montenegro\">{{cite web |title=Montenegro History \u2013 Part I |url=https://www.visit-montenegro.com/montenegro/history/ |website=visit-montenegro.com |accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref> In the monuments of [[Kotor]], Montenegro was mentioned as Montenegro in 1397, as Monte Nigro in 1443 and as Crna Gora in 1435 and 1458, but there are much older papers of Latin sources where Montenegro is mentioned as Monte nigro. The first mention of Montenegro (as Monte nigro) dates to 9 November 1053 in a papal epistle and the others date to 1061, 1097, 1121, 1125, 1144, 1154, 1179 and 1189.<ref name=\"maticacrnogorska\">{{cite web  |title=PRVI POMENI CRNE GORE - Marijan Ma\u0161o Milji\u0107 |url=http://www.maticacrnogorska.me/matica67.html |website=www.maticacrnogorska.me}}</ref>\n\nThe native name ''Crna Gora,'' also meaning \"black mountain,\" came to denote the majority of contemporary Montenegro in the 15th century.<ref name=Fine532>{{harvnb|Fine|1994|p=532}}</ref> Originally, it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the [[Pa\u0161trovi\u0107i]], but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]] took power in [[Upper Zeta]].<ref name=Fine532 /> The aforementioned region became known as ''Stara Crna Gora'' '[[Old Montenegro]]' by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of ''Brda'' '(The) Highlands'. Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]], which saw the annexation of [[Old Herzegovina]] and parts of [[Metohija]] and southern [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]]. Its borders have changed little since then, losing [[Metohija]] and gaining the [[Bay of Kotor]].\n \nAfter the second session of the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|AVNOJ]] during [[World War II in Yugoslavia]], the modern state of Montenegro was founded as the ''[[Federal State of Montenegro]]'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435 / ''Savezna dr\u017eava Crne Gore'') on 15 November 1943 within the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] by the [[State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Montenegro and Boka|ZAVNOCGB]]. After Democratic Federal Yugoslavia became the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FPRY), the Federal State of Montenegro was renamed to the ''[[People's Republic of Montenegro]]'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Narodna Republika Crna Gora'') on 29 November 1945. In 1963, the FPRY was renamed to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and coincidentally, the People's Republic of Montenegro was renamed to the ''[[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]]''  ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Socijalisti\u010dka Republika Crna Gora'').

Over the next few decades, it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and Bosnia, and also became recognised as a kingdom. Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), several civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, [[Mihailo I of Duklja|Mihailo]] (1046\u201381), and his grandson [[Constantine Bodin]] (1081\u20131101).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970116032145/http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 January 1997 |title=Duklja, the first Montenegrin state |publisher=Montenegro.org |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> \n\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0426\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0430.jpg|thumb|upright|Uprising against the [[Ottoman Empire]], 1878, painted by [[\u0110ura Jak\u0161i\u0107]]]]\nBy the 13th century, ''Zeta'' had replaced ''Duklja'' when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]], then the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora'' ([[Venetian language|Venetian]]: ''{{lang|vec|monte negro}}'').\n\nAs the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, it was conquered by [[Stefan Nemanja]] and incorporated into the [[History of Serbia|Serbian realm]] as a province named Zeta. After the [[Serbian Empire]] collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107]]s, became sovereigns of Zeta.\n\nIn 1421, Zeta was annexed to the [[Serbian Despotate]], but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the [[Crnojevi\u0107]]s, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the [[Ottomans]] in 1496, and got annexed to the ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. During the reign of Crnojevi\u0107s, Zeta became known under its current name&nbsp;\u2013 Montenegro. For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous ''sanjak'' in 1514\u20131528 ([[Sanjak of Montenegro]]). Also, [[Old Herzegovina]] region was part of [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]].\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n{{Main|Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro}}\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] was the most popular spiritual and military leader from the [[Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]]. <br />'''Right:''' [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] was a [[List of rulers of Montenegro|Prince-Bishop]] (''vladika'') of Montenegro and the national poet and philosopher, Oil painting of Njego\u0161 as vladika, c.\u2009[[1837]]| width1 = 150\n| image1 = Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 \u0417\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438 XIX. \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430.jpg \n| width2 = \n| image2 = \n| width3 = 143\n| image3 = Njegosh_vladika.jpg\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\nLarge portions fell under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1496 to 1878. In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire permitting Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, raised numerous rebellions, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the [[Great Turkish War]] at the end of that century.\n\nMontenegro consisted of territories controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain (''knez''), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. The great assembly of Montenegrin clans (''Zbor'') was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nParts of the territory were controlled by [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[First French Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], its successors. In 1515, Montenegro became a [[theocracy]] led by the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]], which flourished after the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] of Cetinje became the traditional prince-bishops (whose title was \"Vladika of Montenegro\"). However, the [[Venetian Republic]] introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics. The republic was succeeded by the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1797, and the governors were abolished by Prince-Bishop [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II]] in 1832. His predecessor [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar I]] contributed to the unification of Montenegro with the Highlands.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== Principality and Kingdom of Montenegro===\n{{Main|Principality of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Battle of Vu\u010dji Do, Orao, 1877.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Vu\u010dji Do]], 1876]]\nUnder [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]] (ruled 1860-1918), the [[principality]] was enlarged several times in the Montenegro-Turkish Wars and was recognised as independent in 1878. Nicholas I established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire. Minor border skirmishes excepted, diplomacy ushered in about 30 years of peace between the two states until the deposition of [[Abdul Hamid II]] in 1909.<ref name=\"ttk.gov.tr\">U\u011fur \u00d6zcan, [http://www.ttk.gov.tr/index.php?Page=Yayinlar&KitapNo=989 II.

However, political rifts emerged between the reigning [[People's Party of Montenegro|People's Party]], who supported the process of democratization and union with Serbia, and those of the [[True People's Party]], who were monarchist.\n\nIn 1858 one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the\n[[Battle of Grahovac]]. [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161|Grand Duke Mirko Petrovi\u0107]], elder brother of [[Knjaz Danilo]], led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans (who had 15,000 troops) at [[Grahovac]] on 1 May 1858. The glory of Montenegrin victory was soon immortalized in the songs and literature of all the South Slavs, in particular the Montenegrins in Vojvodina,{{citation needed|date= June 2019}} then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. This forced the [[Great Powers]] to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, ''de facto'' recognizing Montenegro's independence. The Ottoman Empire recognized Montenegrin independence in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.\n\nThe first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855.\n\n[[File:Kralj i kraljica u krugu sire familije.jpg|thumb|[[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Royal family of Montenegro]]: King [[Nikola I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Nicholas I]] with his wife, sons, daughters, grandchildren and sons- and daughters-in-law]]\n\nIn 1910 Montenegro became [[Kingdom of Montenegro|a kingdom]], and as a result of the [[Balkan wars]] in 1912 and 1913 (in which the Ottomans lost most of their Balkan lands), a common border with Serbia was established, with [[Shkod\u00ebr]] being awarded to a newly-created [[Albania]], though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia.\n\nMontenegro became one of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] during [[World War I]] (1914\u201318). From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro. During the occupation, King Nicholas fled the country and a government-in-exile was set up in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n\nIn 1922, Montenegro formally became the [[Oblast of Cetinje]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], with the addition of the coastal areas around [[Budva]] and [[Bay of Kotor]]. In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger [[Zeta Banovina|Zeta Banate]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] that reached the [[Neretva]] River.\n\nNicholas's grandson, the Serb King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]], dominated the Yugoslav government. Zeta Banovina was one of nine banovinas which formed the kingdom; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.\n\n=== World War II and Socialist Yugoslavia===\n{{Main|Italian governorate of Montenegro|Socialist Republic of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Crna Gora - Oslobodjenje od strane okupacije 1711-1918.png|thumb|left|Expansion of Montenegro from 1711 to 1918]]\n\nIn April 1941, [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and other Axis allies attacked and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italian forces occupied Montenegro and established it as a puppet [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]].\n\nIn May, the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for [[guerrilla warfare]]. The first armed uprising in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2010&mm=07&dd=13&nav_category=167&nav_id=445290 |title=Prema oceni istori\u010dara, Trinaestojulski ustanak bio je prvi i najmasovniji oru\u017eani otpor u porobljenoj Evropi 1941. godine |publisher=B92.net |language=Serbian |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nik\u0161i\u0107), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-185-0116-27A, Bucht von Kotor (-), jugoslawische Schiffe.jpg|thumb|Captured ships of the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|Yugoslavian Navy]], [[Bay of Kotor]] 1941.]]\n[[File:Borbe_za_oslobo\u0111enje_Crne_Gore.jpg|thumb|Liberation of Montenegro in World War II]]\n\nFighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included [[Arso Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107 (Yugoslav Partisan)|Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107]], [[Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107-Tempo]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107]], [[Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107]], [[Veljko Vlahovi\u0107]], and [[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107]]. Those loyal to the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]] and opposing communism went on to become [[Chetniks]], and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans.\n\nWar broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of \"anti-communist militia\" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to [[Mostar]], where they fought in the [[Battle of Neretva]] against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.\n\nDuring the German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed large number of Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|occupied by German forces]], and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and entire 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.\n\nMontenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed [[Titograd]] in honour of President [[Josip Broz Tito]]. After the war, the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt, industrialization began, and the [[University of Montenegro]] was established. Greater autonomy was established until the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]] ratified a new constitution in 1974.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== Montenegro within FR Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Serbia and Montenegro|Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)}}\nAfter the dissolution of the SFRY in 1992, Montenegro remained part of a smaller [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] along with Serbia.\n\nIn the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 1992|referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992]], the turnout was 66%, with 96% of the votes cast in favour of the federation with Serbia.

The opponents claimed that the poll was organized under anti-[[Democracy|democratic conditions]] with widespread propaganda from the state-controlled media in favour of a pro-federation vote.

Despite an extensive road network, no roads are built to full motorway standards. Construction of new motorways is considered a national priority, as they are important for uniform regional economic development and the development of Montenegro as an attractive tourist destination.\n\nCurrent [[European route]]s that pass through Montenegro are [[European route E65|E65]] and [[European route E80|E80]].\n\nThe backbone of the Montenegrin rail network is the [[Belgrade\u2013Bar railway]], which provides international connection towards [[Serbia]].

The other branch line from Podgorica towards the Albanian border, the [[Podgorica\u2013Shkod\u00ebr railway]], is not in use.\n\nMontenegro has two international airports, [[Podgorica Airport]] and [[Tivat Airport]]. The two airports served 1.1&nbsp;million passengers in 2008. [[Montenegro Airlines]] is the flag carrier of Montenegro.\n\nThe [[Port of Bar]] is Montenegro's main seaport. Initially built in 1906, the port was almost completely destroyed during [[World War II]], with reconstruction beginning in 1950. Today, it is equipped to handle over 5 million tons of cargo annually, though the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and the size of the Montenegrin industrial sector has resulted in the port operating at a loss and well below capacity for several years. The reconstruction of the [[Belgrade-Bar railway]] and the proposed [[Belgrade-Bar motorway]] are expected to bring the port back up to capacity.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Montenegro}}\n[[File:Widok na Perast z zachodu 01.JPG|thumb|[[Perast]] in the [[Bay of Kotor]]]]\n[[File:Sveti Stefan (06).jpg|thumb|[[Sveti Stefan]]]]\nMontenegro has both a picturesque coast and a mountainous northern region.

Children enroll in elementary schools ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Osnovna \u0161kola'') at the age of 6; it lasts 9 years. The students may continue their secondary education ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Srednja \u0161kola''), which lasts 4 years (3 years for trade schools) and ends with graduation ([[Matura]]). Higher education lasts with a certain first degree after 3 to 6 years. There is one public university ([[University of Montenegro]]) and two private ones ([[Mediterranean University]] and [[University of Donja Gorica]]).\n\n=== Elementary and secondary education ===\nElementary education in Montenegro is free and compulsory for all the children between the ages of 7 and 15 when children attend the \"eight-year school\".\n\nVarious types of elementary education are available to all who qualify, but the vocational and technical schools (gymnasiums), where the students follow four-year course which will take them up to the university entrance, are the most popular. At the secondary level there are a number of art schools, apprentice schools and teacher training schools. Those who have attended the technical schools may pursue their education further at one of two-year post-secondary schools, created in response to the needs of industry and the social services.\n\nSecondary schools are divided in three types, and children attend one depending on choice and primary school grades:\n\n* [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (Gimnazija / \u0413\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438j\u0430) lasts for four years and offers a general, broad education.

His Nero Wolfe novel \"[[The Black Mountain (novel)|The Black Mountain]]\" was largely set in Montenegro during the 1950s.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Main|Media of Montenegro}}\nThe media of Montenegro refers to mass media outlets based in Montenegro. Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Montenegro]] guarantees freedom of speech.\nAs a [[country in transition]], Montenegro's media system is under transformation.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Montenegrin cuisine}}\n[[File:Foods from Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Foods from Montenegro]]\nMontenegrin cuisine is a result of Montenegro's long history. It is a variation of Mediterranean and Oriental. The most influence is from Italy, [[Turkey]], [[Byzantine Empire]]/[[Greece]], and Hungary. Montenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; the cuisine in the coastal area differs from the one in the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of [[Mediterranean cuisine]], with seafood being a common dish, while the northern represents more the Oriental.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Montenegro}}\n[[File:Nikola Vucevic Dec 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107]], a professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Orlando Magic]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] ([[NBA]]).]]\n\nThe '''Sports in Montenegro''' revolves mostly around team sports, such as [[Association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[water polo]], [[volleyball]], and [[Team handball|handball]].

The population was 17,218 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 13,249 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], but the seasonal (part-time) population can exceed 20,000. Located between [[Cathedral City, California|Cathedral City]] and [[Palm Desert, California|Palm Desert]], it is one of the nine cities of the [[Coachella Valley]] ([[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] area). Rancho Mirage was incorporated in 1973 from a merger of Mirage Cove with five unincorporated areas known as the \"Cove communities\" (Desert, Magnesia, Palmas, Tamarisk, and Thunderbird), and had 3,000 permanent residents at the time.\n\n==History==\nAlthough the first modern settlements date back to the 1920s and 1930s, Rancho Mirage got its claim to fame after World War II. The Annenberg Estate or ''[[Sunnylands]]'', owned by philanthropists [[Walter Annenberg|Walter]] and [[Leonore Annenberg]], had long been popular with the wealthy and powerful, including [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Patrick Macnee]], [[Zeppo Marx]] and [[Mary Martin]]. Several [[Presidents of the United States|United States Presidents]] have vacationed at the Annenberg estate, including [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Gerald Ford]]. President Ford later bought a house in Rancho Mirage and was living there at the time of his death in 2006. The [[Betty Ford Center]], a world-renowned addiction rehabilitation center, is located in Rancho Mirage at the [[Eisenhower Medical Center]]. President [[Barack Obama]] also used [[Sunnylands]] for summit meetings with world leaders during his administration.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/us/politics/obama-revives-the-republican-glory-years-of-sunnylands-estate.html |title=Obama Revives the Republican Glory Years of Sunnylands Estate |first=Mark |last=Landler |date=February 7, 2016 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nRancho Mirage has thirteen golf courses, also known as country clubs or golf resorts. The city's first resort was the Thunderbird Guest Ranch, opened in 1946 for entertainers and business clientele. Other golf resorts are The S at Rancho Mirage, Tamarisk, Mission Hills, Thunderbird, The Springs, Sunrise, Omni Resorts Rancho Las Palmas hotel (opened in 1979 to replace the Desert Air golf and private airport from 1954\u20131978), Morningside, Mission Hills North Course, [[Westin Hotels]] Mission Hills resort, and Tuscania by Sunrise Company opened in 2006.\n\nThe [[Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians]] of Palm Springs runs the [[Agua Caliente Casino Resort Spa|Agua Caliente Casino]] on the intersection of Bob Hope Drive and Ramon Road off [[Interstate 10]], opened in 2002. The casino is a popular destination for locals, tourists, and gambling enthusiasts. In 2008 the tribal board completed the expansion of the Agua Caliente resort, which includes a 16-story hotel and spa, as well as remodeling the casino and expanding the parking structures. A theater for top name entertainers opened in 2009. Though the Agua Caliente Resort and Casino was just outside the border of Rancho Mirage in an unincorporated area, the City of Rancho Mirage included the property as part of the city in an agreement with the tribe so they would have access to police and firefighting services.\n\n<!-- The former First Family is heading west.

The population was 17,218 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 13,249 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], but the seasonal (part-time) population can exceed 20,000. Located between [[Cathedral City, California|Cathedral City]] and [[Palm Desert, California|Palm Desert]], it is one of the nine cities of the [[Coachella Valley]] ([[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] area). Rancho Mirage was incorporated in 1973 from a merger of Mirage Cove with five unincorporated areas known as the \"Cove communities\" (Desert, Magnesia, Palmas, Tamarisk, and Thunderbird), and had 3,000 permanent residents at the time.\n\n==History==\nAlthough the first modern settlements date back to the 1920s and 1930s, Rancho Mirage got its claim to fame after World War II. The Annenberg Estate or ''[[Sunnylands]]'', owned by philanthropists [[Walter Annenberg|Walter]] and [[Leonore Annenberg]], had long been popular with the wealthy and powerful, including [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Patrick Macnee]], [[Zeppo Marx]] and [[Mary Martin]]. Several [[Presidents of the United States|United States Presidents]] have vacationed at the Annenberg estate, including [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Gerald Ford]]. President Ford later bought a house in Rancho Mirage and was living there at the time of his death in 2006. The [[Betty Ford Center]], a world-renowned addiction rehabilitation center, is located in Rancho Mirage at the [[Eisenhower Medical Center]]. President [[Barack Obama]] also used [[Sunnylands]] for summit meetings with world leaders during his administration.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/us/politics/obama-revives-the-republican-glory-years-of-sunnylands-estate.html |title=Obama Revives the Republican Glory Years of Sunnylands Estate |first=Mark |last=Landler |date=February 7, 2016 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nRancho Mirage has thirteen golf courses, also known as country clubs or golf resorts. The city's first resort was the Thunderbird Guest Ranch, opened in 1946 for entertainers and business clientele. Other golf resorts are The S at Rancho Mirage, Tamarisk, Mission Hills, Thunderbird, The Springs, Sunrise, Omni Resorts Rancho Las Palmas hotel (opened in 1979 to replace the Desert Air golf and private airport from 1954\u20131978), Morningside, Mission Hills North Course, [[Westin Hotels]] Mission Hills resort, and Tuscania by Sunrise Company opened in 2006.\n\nThe [[Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians]] of Palm Springs runs the [[Agua Caliente Casino]] on the intersection of Bob Hope Drive and Ramon Road off [[Interstate 10]], opened in 2002. The casino is a popular destination for locals, tourists, and gambling enthusiasts. In 2008 the tribal board completed the expansion of the Agua Caliente resort, which includes a 16-story hotel and spa, as well as remodeling the casino and expanding the parking structures. A theater for top name entertainers opened in 2009. Though the Agua Caliente Resort and Casino was just outside the border of Rancho Mirage in an unincorporated area, the City of Rancho Mirage included the property as part of the city in an agreement with the tribe so they would have access to police and firefighting services.\n\n<!-- The former First Family is heading west.
