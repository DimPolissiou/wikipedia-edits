Today, a statue of Bishop Hamline sculpted by the late professor of art Michael Price stands on campus. Hamline is also distinct for being founded as a [[coeducation|coeducational institution]], a rarity in 19th-century America.<ref>{{cite web | last = Bloomberg | first = Kristin Mapel | title = Nineteenth-Century Methodists and Coeducation: The Case of Hamline University  | year = 2008 | url = http://archives.gcah.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10516/237/05%20-%20Oct%2008%20Bloomberg.pdf?sequence=1 | accessdate = 2010-02-17}}</ref> Hamline's first home was in [[Red Wing, Minnesota]]. The school's charter stipulated that Hamline be located \"at some point on the Mississippi between [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and Lake Pepin.\" The city of Red Wing pledged about $10,000 to enable construction of a building and the beginning of an endowment, and it also donated a tract of land on a hillside overlooking the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>Johnson W., David. ''Hamline University: A History 1854&ndash;1994'', 4</ref>\n\nHamline University holds the title of the oldest university in Minnesota. It was charted in 1854 and began offering collegiate courses in 1857. While the [[University of Minnesota]] was chartered by the territorial authorities in 1851, it did not operate as a place of higher education until nearly two decades later.<ref name=\"Jarchow 1978\"/>\n\nThe first classes at Hamline were held in rooms housed on the second floor of the village general store while the construction of the classroom building was in progress. Students moved into the Red Wing building in January 1856. The original building contained a chapel, recitation rooms, a school room, a library, laboratory, reading rooms, and dormitory quarters. Seventy-three students enrolled at Hamline in the opening year. The catalog lists them separately as \u201cLadies and Gentlemen,\u201d but most of them were children or adolescents. All were enrolled in either the primary or the preparatory department. There was no collegiate division \u2013 the frontier had not yet produced students ready for college. Tuition ranged from $4.00 to $6.66 per term. The collegiate program was introduced in 1857, and in 1859, Hamline graduated its first class.<ref>''Alumni Directory: Hamline University; 1854&ndash;1966'', 16</ref>\n\nWith the start of the [[American Civil War]], enrollment in the college division dropped from 60 to 16 in one year. There was no graduating class in 1862. Records indicate that 119 Hamline men served in the Union armies during the war. In 1869, the university shut down. The first building at the Red Wing site was torn down in 1872.<ref>Pace Nelson., Charles.

Here it is labeled \"College Place.\"]]It had been expected that Hamline would reopen on a new site within two years after the closing at Red Wing; however, indecision in the selection of a new site caused a delay. In the end, a {{convert|77|acre|ha|adj=on}} Saint Paul prairie plot halfway between the downtowns of [[Minneapolis]] and Saint Paul was selected. Construction began in 1873, but by then an economic depression had overtaken the planners, and there were repeated postponements and delays. University Hall, begun in 1873, was constructed in installments as money came in, and was not completed until the summer of 1880.<ref>Nute Lee, ''In Hamline Halls'', p. 111</ref>\n\nThe doors opened on September 22, 1880, and Hamline's history in Saint Paul began.<ref>Johnson W., David ''Hamline University A History'' (St. Paul, MN: North Central Publishing Company, 1980), 20</ref> The catalog for that year lists 113 students, with all but five of them being preparatory students. Tuition in the collegiate division was $30 per year. Two degrees were offered at the time: the B.A. and the B.S. In 1883, the bachelor of philosophy degree replaced the B.S., and remained in use until 1914, when the faculty dropped the PhB. and restored the B.S. degree.\n\nOn February 7, 1883, University Hall, barely two years old, burned to the ground.<ref>St. Paul ''Daily Globe'', February 8, 1883</ref> To replace the structure, plans for a new University Hall were prepared. Eleven months later, the new structure, the present Old Main, was completed. Emergency space for classrooms was provided by Ladies' Hall, which had opened in 1882.<ref>''The Minnesota Methodist and Hamline Review'', I (June, 1882)</ref> Other new construction included Science Hall, which was completed in 1887, the Carnegie library in 1907, and the new gymnasium, which was completed in 1909.<ref>Alumni Directory Hamline University 1854&ndash;1966 (St. Paul, MN, 1966), 22.</ref>\n\n===World War I and postwar years (1915&ndash;1929)===\nWhen [[World War I]] came in April 1917, track and baseball schedules for spring were cancelled as enlistments and applications of officers' training depleted the teams. Hamline was designated one of 38 colleges in the country to supply men for ambulance work in France. Twenty-six men were selected for the unit and served in France with the 28th Division of the [[French Army]].<ref>Osborn L., Henry ''Hamline University in the World War''</ref> Ambulance work during World War I involved great personal danger and took great expertise to stay alive. Three former students of Hamline University, Wallace Ramstad, Glen Donaldson, and Walter Gammel died in battle. One of the more notable situations the Hamline ambulance unit, otherwise known as Section 568, was involved in was the fighting in the Meuse-Argonne territory, which lasted forty-seven days. During the war, Section 568 proudly retained the banner that girl students from Hamline had sewn for them before their training. Eventually, by the end of the war Section 568 received the Croix de Guerre from the French government for their service.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Jack K.|date=2015|title=\"Our United Effort\": Hamline University's World War I Ambulance Company|jstor=24898890|journal=[[Minnesota History (journal)|Minnesota History]]|volume=64|issue=8|pages=320\u2013329}}</ref>  In the fall of 1918, a unit of the Students' Army Training Corps was established at Hamline, and almost every male student became an enlisted member. The Science Hall was used for military purposes, with the basement becoming the mess hall and the museum and several classrooms being marked for squad rooms and sleeping quarters.<ref>Nute Lee., Grace ''In Hamline Halls'', 216</ref>\n\n===The Great Depression and World War II (1930&ndash;1945)===\nThe [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] created significant challenges for Hamline. The most difficult were the years in the early 1930s, in which the repercussions of the depression were intensified by conflicts over internal reorganization.<ref>Johnson W., David. Hamline University: A History, 109</ref> Increased enrollments reflected the belief that it was better for students to be in college than to be sitting at home in idleness and despair. The college tried to help by providing jobs and [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]], and by lowering charges for tuition and room and board.[[File:1930s HU STUDENTS.jpg|thumb|425px|right|Hamline University students take a final during the 1930s]]<ref name=\"University1\">''Alumni Directory: Hamline University; 1854&ndash;1966'',74</ref> Jobs of any kind were at a premium, with the most prized being board jobs in the Manor House and at the Quality Tea Room on Snelling Avenue. Also in top demand were board and room jobs for women in private homes. In the meantime, the portion of the college endowment invested in farmlands turned unproductive, and the university's income fell following reductions in tuition. All of this led to annual deficits and substantial cuts in faculty salaries. It was not until 1935 that Hamline began to recover from the depression.<ref name=\"University1\"/> During the war years, Hamline's enrollment held above 600, except in 1943 and 1944. Although males registrations dropped as men entered the armed services, women's enrollment increased as nursing students arrived.<ref>Johnson W., David. Hamline University: A History, 108</ref>\nHamline and the Asbury Methodist Hospital of Minneapolis launched a new venture in 1940 when they collaboratively established the Hamline-Asbury School of Nursing, which offered a five-year program leading to a bachelor of science in nursing. Hamline moved with a growing trend to provide academic training for women preparing for careers in nursing. A three-year program leading to a diploma in nursing was also offered. In 1949, the Mounds-Midway School of Nursing joined the school, and the newly enlarged institution took the name of the Hamline University School of Nursing.<ref>Johnson W., David. Hamline University: A History, 120</ref>\n\n===Post World War II (1946\u20131966)===\nA flood of veterans entered or returned to college after World War II under the [[G.I. Bill of Rights]]. The first reached the campus in the fall of 1946, when registrations passed 1,000 for the first time. Enrollment reached a new high in 1949 when 1,452 students, including 289 in the nursing school.<ref>''Alumni Directory: Hamline University; 1854&ndash;1966'', 119</ref> The nursing school, which had been an integral part of Hamline since 1940 and had won wide recognition for the excellence of its program, was discontinued in 1962 following a decision to concentrate resources and staff on liberal arts programs. The last class in the three-year program graduated in 1960 and the last class in the degree program graduated in 1962. A total of 447 women completed the degree program, and 758 women finished the three-year program.\n\nAfter World War II, two new residence halls were built &ndash; Drew Residence for men and Sorin Hall for women. A new fine arts center was completed in 1950, and the Drew Hall of Science was dedicated in 1952. The old science building was taken over by the social science and other departments and was renamed Social Science Hall. In 1963, the A.G. Bush Student Center was completed, and at the time, its modern facilities made it at once the social, recreational, and cultural center of the campus.<ref>''Alumni Directory: Hamline University; 1854&ndash;1966'', 121</ref> Throughout this period, buildings were enlarged or remodeled to keep pace with new needs and standards. Wings were added to the Manor House and Drew Residence. The seating capacity of the library was increased to 100 with the completion of a new periodical room, and the old student union was remodeled and turned into a laboratory with classrooms and office space for the language departments. In the summer of 1966, extensive alterations and improvements were made in Hutton Arena and in the theater of the fine arts center.<ref>''Alumni Directory: Hamline University; 1854&ndash;1966'', 123</ref>\n\nBetween 1953 and 1966, faculty members received grants totaling more than $600,000 for special education and research programs.<ref>''Alumni Directory: Hamline University; 1854&ndash;1966'', 124</ref>\n\n===New academic publications (1966\u20131987)===\nHamline broke ground in May 1970 for the $2.6 million Bush Memorial Library.

Hamline began construction on a $7.7 million student apartment building at 1470 Englewood for 142 graduate and law students on September 2, 1998. The building was completed in 2000, in time for students to move in for the fall term.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hamline.edu/150/architecture.html|title=Historical Hamline: Modern Architecture|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Hamline University|accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref>\nAfter four years of planning, ground was broken on October 18, 1996, for an $8.5 million sports, recreation, and health complex\u2014Lloyd W.

An archaeological dig headed by John McCarthy of the Institute of Minnesota Archaeology and anthropology professor Skip Messenger began at the site of Hamline's original building in Red Wing. The three-story brick building, constructed in 1855 and open in time for classes to begin in January 1856, closed in 1869 and was demolished in 1871. Since few records exist from that time, the exact location and dimensions of the original building were unknown until the archaeological dig. The dig found that the original building's foundation was insufficient for its size, leading to speculation that structural problems might have contributed to the building's closing and eventual demolition.<ref>Johnson, Chip.

Seventy-three students enrolled at Hamline in the opening year. The catalog lists them separately as \u201cLadies and Gentlemen,\u201d but most of them were children or adolescents. All were enrolled in either the primary or the preparatory department. There was no collegiate division \u2013 the frontier had not yet produced students ready for college. Tuition ranged from $4.00 to $6.66 per term. The collegiate program was introduced in 1857, and in 1859, Hamline graduated its first class.<ref>''Alumni Directory: Hamline University; 1854&ndash;1966'', 16</ref>\n\nWith the start of the [[American Civil War]], enrollment in the college division dropped from 60 to 16 in one year. There was no graduating class in 1862. Records indicate that 119 Hamline men served in the Union armies during the war. In 1869, the university shut down. The first building at the Red Wing site was torn down in 1872.<ref>Pace Nelson., Charles.

Here it is labeled \"College Place.\"]]It had been expected that Hamline would reopen on a new site within two years after the closing at Red Wing; however, indecision in the selection of a new site caused a delay. In the end, a {{convert|77|acre|ha|adj=on}} Saint Paul prairie plot halfway between the downtowns of [[Minneapolis]] and Saint Paul was selected. Construction began in 1873, but by then an economic depression had overtaken the planners, and there were repeated postponements and delays. University Hall, begun in 1873, was constructed in installments as money came in, and was not completed until the summer of 1880.<ref>Nute Lee, ''In Hamline Halls'', p. 111</ref>\n\nThe doors opened on September 22, 1880, and Hamline's history in Saint Paul began.<ref>Johnson W., David ''Hamline University A History'' (St. Paul, MN: North Central Publishing Company, 1980), 20</ref> The catalog for that year lists 113 students, with all but five of them being preparatory students. Tuition in the collegiate division was $30 per year. Two degrees were offered at the time: the B.A. and the B.S. In 1883, the bachelor of philosophy degree replaced the B.S., and remained in use until 1914, when the faculty dropped the PhB. and restored the B.S. degree.\n\nOn February 7, 1883, University Hall, barely two years old, burned to the ground.<ref>St. Paul ''Daily Globe'', February 8, 1883</ref> To replace the structure, plans for a new University Hall were prepared. Eleven months later, the new structure, the present Old Main, was completed. Emergency space for classrooms was provided by Ladies' Hall, which had opened in 1882.<ref>''The Minnesota Methodist and Hamline Review'', I (June, 1882)</ref> Other new construction included Science Hall, which was completed in 1887, the Carnegie library in 1907, and the new gymnasium, which was completed in 1909.<ref>Alumni Directory Hamline University 1854&ndash;1966 (St. Paul, MN, 1966), 22.</ref>\n\n===World War I and postwar years (1915&ndash;1929)===\nWhen [[World War I]] came in April 1917, track and baseball schedules for spring were cancelled as enlistments and applications of officers' training depleted the teams. Hamline was designated one of 38 colleges in the country to supply men for ambulance work in France. Twenty-six men were selected for the unit and served in France with the 28th Division of the [[French Army]].<ref>Osborn L., Henry ''Hamline University in the World War''</ref> Ambulance work during World War I involved great personal danger and took great expertise to stay alive. Three former students of Hamline University, Wallace Ramstad, Glen Donaldson, and Walter Gammel died in battle. One of the more notable situations the Hamline ambulance unit, otherwise known as Section 568, was involved in was the fighting in the Meuse-Argonne territory, which lasted forty-seven days. During the war, Section 568 proudly retained the banner that girl students from Hamline had sewn for them before their training. Eventually, by the end of the war Section 568 received the Croix de Guerre from the French government for their service.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Jack K.|date=2015|title=\"Our United Effort\": Hamline University's World War I Ambulance Company|jstor=24898890|journal=[[Minnesota History (journal)|]]|volume=64|issue=8|pages=320\u2013329}}</ref>  In the fall of 1918, a unit of the Students' Army Training Corps was established at Hamline, and almost every male student became an enlisted member. The Science Hall was used for military purposes, with the basement becoming the mess hall and the museum and several classrooms being marked for squad rooms and sleeping quarters.<ref>Nute Lee., Grace ''In Hamline Halls'', 216</ref>\n\n===The Great Depression and World War II (1930&ndash;1945)===\nThe [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] created significant challenges for Hamline. The most difficult were the years in the early 1930s, in which the repercussions of the depression were intensified by conflicts over internal reorganization.<ref>Johnson W., David. Hamline University: A History, 109</ref> Increased enrollments reflected the belief that it was better for students to be in college than to be sitting at home in idleness and despair. The college tried to help by providing jobs and [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]], and by lowering charges for tuition and room and board.[[File:1930s HU STUDENTS.jpg|thumb|425px|right|Hamline University students take a final during the 1930s]]<ref name=\"University1\">''Alumni Directory: Hamline University; 1854&ndash;1966'',74</ref> Jobs of any kind were at a premium, with the most prized being board jobs in the Manor House and at the Quality Tea Room on Snelling Avenue. Also in top demand were board and room jobs for women in private homes. In the meantime, the portion of the college endowment invested in farmlands turned unproductive, and the university's income fell following reductions in tuition. All of this led to annual deficits and substantial cuts in faculty salaries. It was not until 1935 that Hamline began to recover from the depression.<ref name=\"University1\"/> During the war years, Hamline's enrollment held above 600, except in 1943 and 1944. Although males registrations dropped as men entered the armed services, women's enrollment increased as nursing students arrived.<ref>Johnson W., David. Hamline University: A History, 108</ref>\nHamline and the Asbury Methodist Hospital of Minneapolis launched a new venture in 1940 when they collaboratively established the Hamline-Asbury School of Nursing, which offered a five-year program leading to a bachelor of science in nursing. Hamline moved with a growing trend to provide academic training for women preparing for careers in nursing. A three-year program leading to a diploma in nursing was also offered. In 1949, the Mounds-Midway School of Nursing joined the school, and the newly enlarged institution took the name of the Hamline University School of Nursing.<ref>Johnson W., David. Hamline University: A History, 120</ref>\n\n===Post World War II (1946\u20131966)===\nA flood of veterans entered or returned to college after World War II under the [[G.I. Bill of Rights]]. The first reached the campus in the fall of 1946, when registrations passed 1,000 for the first time. Enrollment reached a new high in 1949 when 1,452 students, including 289 in the nursing school.<ref>''Alumni Directory: Hamline University; 1854&ndash;1966'', 119</ref> The nursing school, which had been an integral part of Hamline since 1940 and had won wide recognition for the excellence of its program, was discontinued in 1962 following a decision to concentrate resources and staff on liberal arts programs. The last class in the three-year program graduated in 1960 and the last class in the degree program graduated in 1962. A total of 447 women completed the degree program, and 758 women finished the three-year program.\n\nAfter World War II, two new residence halls were built &ndash; Drew Residence for men and Sorin Hall for women. A new fine arts center was completed in 1950, and the Drew Hall of Science was dedicated in 1952. The old science building was taken over by the social science and other departments and was renamed Social Science Hall. In 1963, the A.G. Bush Student Center was completed, and at the time, its modern facilities made it at once the social, recreational, and cultural center of the campus.<ref>''Alumni Directory: Hamline University; 1854&ndash;1966'', 121</ref> Throughout this period, buildings were enlarged or remodeled to keep pace with new needs and standards. Wings were added to the Manor House and Drew Residence. The seating capacity of the library was increased to 100 with the completion of a new periodical room, and the old student union was remodeled and turned into a laboratory with classrooms and office space for the language departments. In the summer of 1966, extensive alterations and improvements were made in Hutton Arena and in the theater of the fine arts center.<ref>''Alumni Directory: Hamline University; 1854&ndash;1966'', 123</ref>\n\nBetween 1953 and 1966, faculty members received grants totaling more than $600,000 for special education and research programs.<ref>''Alumni Directory: Hamline University; 1854&ndash;1966'', 124</ref>\n\n===New academic publications (1966\u20131987)===\nHamline broke ground in May 1970 for the $2.6 million Bush Memorial Library.

An archaeological dig headed by John McCarthy of the Institute of Minnesota Archaeology and anthropology professor Skip Messenger began at the site of Hamline's original building in Red Wing. The three-story brick building, constructed in 1855 and open in time for classes to begin in January 1856, closed in 1869 and was demolished in 1871. Since few records exist from that time, the exact location and dimensions of the original building were unknown until the archaeological dig. The dig found that the original building's foundation was insufficient for its size, leading to speculation that structural problems might have contributed to the building's closing and eventual demolition.<ref>Johnson, Chip.

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet.

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet. They would carry their Springfields until their end of service.\n\n==Casualties and total strength==\nThe 17th Maine enrolled 1,371 men during its existence.<ref>http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/archives/military/civilwar/17meinf.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230092433/http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/archives/military/civilwar/17meinf.htm |date=2006-12-30 }} State of Maine Civil War Records Website</ref> It lost 12 officers and 116 enlisted men killed in action or died of wounds received in battle and an additional 4 officers and 159 enlisted men died of disease.<ref>http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unmeinf1.htm Civil War Archive Website, after Dyer</ref>  31 men died in Confederate prisons.

It grew up as a [[Coach (carriage)|coaching]] stop on the route between [[Cambridge]] and London. It is located {{convert|3|mi|0}} West of [[Harlow]] {{convert|4|mi|0}} southeast of [[Hertford]], {{convert|5|mi|0}} north of [[Waltham Cross]] and {{convert|11|mi}} southwest of [[Bishop's Stortford]]. At its height during the 18th century, more than 35 coaches a day passed through the town. It saw a boom in the mid 20th century as [[Gravel extraction|gravel]] was extracted from the area, but was exhausted by the 1970s. The lakes and water pits left behind have been used as leisure amenities. Today, Hoddesdon has a little light industry but is mainly a [[London commuter belt]] town. The town hosted the eighth [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne]] in 1951. It is twinned with the Belgian city of [[Dinant]].\n\nThe [[Prime Meridian]] passes just to the east of Hoddesdon.\n\nThe town is served by [[Rye House railway station]] and nearby [[Broxbourne railway station]].\n\n==History==\n=== Early history ===\nThe name \"Hoddesdon\" is believed to be derived from a Saxon or Danish [[Hod (Norse mythology)|personal name]] combined with the [[Old English]] suffix \"don\", meaning a down or hill.<ref name=garside>{{cite web |url=http://www.hoddesdonrotary.org/mainpages/hoddesdon.htm |title=Hoddesdon |accessdate=18 July 2008 |author=Sue Garside |year=2008 |work= |publisher=Rotary Club of Hoddesdon}}</ref> The earliest historical reference to the name is in the [[Domesday Book]] within the hundred of Hertford.<ref>[http://opendomesday.org/place/TL3708/hoddesdon/ Open Domesday Online: Hoddesdon]</ref>\n\nHoddesdon was situated about {{convert|20|mi}} north of London on the main road to [[Cambridge]] and to the north.

The institution survived the [[dissolution of the monasteries]], but had ceased to exist by the mid 16th century, although it is commemorated in the name of [[Spital Brook]] which divides Hoddesdon from Broxbourne.<ref name=vch/>\n\nIn 1336 William de la Marche was licensed to build a [[chapel of ease]] in the town. The building, known as St Katharine's Chapel, survived until the 17th century, when it was demolished. The tower survived until 1836.<ref name=vch/> The chapel was used by pilgrims to the shrine at [[Walsingham]].<ref name=garside/>\n\nThe town was considerably enlarged in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and a number of inns in the High Street date from this time.<ref name=garside/> The monarch granted a [[royal charter]] in 1559/60, placing the town government under a bailiff, warden and eight assistants. The charter also established a free [[grammar school]] based on the site of the former hospital, and this was placed under the care of the corporation. Neither the borough nor the school flourished, however, and both had ceased to exist by the end of the century.<ref name=vch/> In 1567 Sir [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] acquired the [[manorialism|manor]] of Hoddesdonsbury and two years later Elizabeth granted him the neighbouring manor of Baas. From that date the Cecils maintained a connection with the town which is recorded by the naming of The Salisbury Arms (anciently the ''Black Lion'' Inn) : the title [[Marquess of Salisbury]] was granted to James Cecil in 1789.\n\nIn 1622 Sir [[Marmaduke Rawdon]] built [[Rawdon House]], a red-brick mansion which still survives.

This plot was known as the [[Rye House Plot]], named from Rye House at Hoddesdon, near which ran a narrow road where Charles was supposed to be killed as he travelled from a horse meeting at Newmarket. By chance, according to the official narrative, the king's unexpectedly early departure in March foiled the plot. Ten weeks later, on 1 June, an informer's allegations prompted a government investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Rye House Plot {{!}} English history|url = http://www.britannica.com/event/Rye-House-Plot|website = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate = 22 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe subsequent history of Rye House has been considerably less dramatic. In 1870 the current owner, William Henry Teale, opened a pleasure garden, displaying the Great Bed of Ware, which he had recently acquired.

The rest of the grass-covered site has the floor-plan of the house marked out.<ref name=\"www.communitysites.co.uk\"/>\n\nA new chapel of ease, dedicated to [[St Paul]], was built in 1762. This was subsequently rebuilt and enlarged, and in 1844 become the parish church when Hoddesdon was created a separate ecclesiastical parish.<ref name=vch/> Previously the town had been divided between the two parishes of [[Broxbourne]] and [[Great Amwell]]. The boundary between the two parishes ran through an archway in the town's High Street. When this building was demolished in the 1960s, a specially inscribed stone was set into the pavement marking the historic boundary. In place of St Katharine's Chapel a new clock house was built.<ref name=garside/>\n\nBrewing was first established in the town in about 1700. In 1803, William Christie established a brewery in the town, and it became a major employer and one of the largest breweries in England.

Much of the town centre was demolished in the 1960s and 1970s, with the construction of the Tower Centre and Fawkon Walk shopping centres.

The western boundary of the urban district was fixed by the track of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Ermine Street]]. Hoddesdon Urban District was abolished in 1974 by the [[Local Government Act 1972]], when it merged with Cheshunt Urban District to become the Borough of Broxbourne. \n\n[[File:Hoddesdon.jpg|The Tower Centre's mosaic|right|thumb]]\n\n==Education==\n[[The John Warner School]] is a community, foundation comprehensive for 11 to 18-year-olds. [[Sheredes School]] served the area from 1969 to 2016. In 2012 Sheredes received the artsmark gold award in recognition of the outstanding work in the arts and was one of only a handful of schools nationally to have been awarded this for a fourth time. After Sheredes closed, the [[Robert Barclay Academy]], a community comprehensive for 11 to 18 year olds took over the site. John Warner has specialist status in Science and sport and Sheredes was well regarded in the arts.\n\nIn 2007 the John Warner School received congratulations from Mr [[Jim Knight]], Minister of State for Education for being placed 24th in the '100 most improved schools in the country'. This award is a combination of eight years continuous improvement in examination results.\n\n==Sport and leisure==\nAs well as the array of shops in and around Hoddesdon, there are a number of leisure activities in the local area, including a gym in the town centre and the [[John Warner sports centre]], a leisure centre on the outskirts of the town containing a swimming pool and children's activity centre.\nThere is also a [[Non-League football]] club [[Hoddesdon Town F.C.]], which plays at Lowfield, and a large go-kart track located in nearby Rye park.

At its height during the 18th century, more than 35 coaches a day passed through the town. It saw a boom in the mid 20th century as [[Gravel extraction|gravel]] was extracted from the area, but was exhausted by the 1970s. The lakes and water pits left behind have been used as leisure amenities. Today, Hoddesdon has a little light industry but is mainly a [[London commuter belt]] town. The town hosted the eighth [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne]] in 1951. It is twinned with the Belgian city of [[Dinant]].\n\nThe [[Prime Meridian]] passes just to the east of Hoddesdon.\n\nThe town is served by [[Rye House railway station]] and nearby [[Broxbourne railway station]].\n\n==History==\n=== Early history ===\nThe name \"Hoddesdon\" is believed to be derived from a Saxon or Danish [[Hod (Norse mythology)|personal name]] combined with the [[Old English]] suffix \"don\", meaning a down or hill.<ref name=garside>{{cite web |url=http://www.hoddesdonrotary.org/mainpages/hoddesdon.htm |title=Hoddesdon |accessdate=18 July 2008 |author=Sue Garside |year=2008 |work= |publisher=Rotary Club of Hoddesdon}}</ref> The earliest historical reference to the name is in the [[Domesday Book]] within the hundred of Hertford.<ref>[http://opendomesday.org/place/TL3708/hoddesdon/ Open Domesday Online: Hoddesdon]</ref>\n\nHoddesdon was situated about {{convert|20|mi}} north of London on the main road to [[Cambridge]] and to the north.

This plot was known as the [[Rye House Plot]], named from Rye House at Hoddesdon, near which ran a narrow road where Charles was supposed to be killed as he travelled from a horse meeting at Newmarket. By chance, according to the official narrative, the king's unexpectedly early departure in March foiled the plot.

It was such a popular destination for excursions from London that an extra station was built on the Liverpool Street to Hertford East line to serve it.<ref name=\"www.communitysites.co.uk\">{{Cite web|title = A historic Hoddesdon house {{!}} Rye House {{!}} Historic Houses {{!}} Places {{!}} Herts Memories|url = http://www.hertsmemories.org.uk/page/rye_house?path=0p3p36p|website = www.hertsmemories.org.uk|accessdate = 22 December 2015|first = Community Sites|last = (www.communitysites.co.uk)}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 20th century, however, the tourist trade had fallen off, and Rye House was demolished, apart from the Gatehouse; the Great Bed was moved to the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]].<ref name=\"www.communitysites.co.uk\"/>\n\nRye House Gatehouse still stands today, and is now a [[Grade 1 listed]] building, with high-quality diaper brickwork{{Clarify|date=January 2016}} and a \"barley sugar twist\" chimney. It is open to the public at weekends and bank holidays during the summer, featuring displays about the Plot and the early history of brick-building. The rest of the grass-covered site has the floor-plan of the house marked out.<ref name=\"www.communitysites.co.uk\"/>\n\nA new chapel of ease, dedicated to [[St Paul]], was built in 1762. This was subsequently rebuilt and enlarged, and in 1844 become the parish church when Hoddesdon was created a separate ecclesiastical parish.<ref name=vch/> Previously the town had been divided between the two parishes of [[Broxbourne]] and [[Great Amwell]]. The boundary between the two parishes ran through an archway in the town's High Street. When this building was demolished in the 1960s, a specially inscribed stone was set into the pavement marking the historic boundary. In place of St Katharine's Chapel a new clock house was built.<ref name=garside/>\n\nBrewing was first established in the town in about 1700. In 1803, William Christie established a brewery in the town, and it became a major employer and one of the largest breweries in England. The brewery continued in operation until 1928.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lowewood.com/news/category.asp?cat_id=25 |title=Christie Photo Album |accessdate=18 July 2008 |author= |date=1 June 2007 |work= |publisher=Lowewood Museum |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713234924/http://www.lowewood.com/news/category.asp?cat_id=25 |archivedate=13 July 2011 }}</ref> Most of the brewery buildings was demolished in 1930, although part was converted into a cinema itself since demolished.

As time went on, more and more hops were carried on the river rather than the roads and the Wednesday meat [[market (place)|market]] took predominance. The Wednesday market has survived and a Friday market was added in the late 20th century.\n\n=== After the Second World War ===\nAfter the [[Second World War]] Hoddesdon increasingly became a [[dormitory town]], forming part of the [[London commuter belt]]. Much of the town centre was demolished in the 1960s and 1970s, with the construction of the Tower Centre and Fawkon Walk shopping centres.

The western boundary of the urban district was fixed by the track of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Ermine Street]]. Hoddesdon Urban District was abolished in 1974 by the [[Local Government Act 1972]], when it merged with Cheshunt Urban District to become the Borough of Broxbourne. \n\n[[File:Hoddesdon.jpg|The Tower Centre's mosaic|right|thumb]]\n\n==Education==\n[[The John Warner School]] is a community, foundation comprehensive for 11 to 18-year-olds. [[Sheredes School]] served the area from 1969 to 2016. In 2012 Sheredes received the artsmark gold award in recognition of the outstanding work in the arts and was one of only a handful of schools nationally to have been awarded this for a fourth time. After Sheredes closed, the [[Robert Barclay Academy]], a community comprehensive for 11 to 18 year olds took over the site. John Warner has specialist status in Science and sport and Sheredes was well regarded in the arts.\n\nIn 2007 the John Warner School received congratulations from Mr [[Jim Knight]], Minister of State for Education for being placed 24th in the '100 most improved schools in the country'. This award is a combination of eight years continuous improvement in examination results.\n\n==Sport and leisure==\nAs well as the array of shops in and around Hoddesdon, there are a number of leisure activities in the local area, including a gym in the town centre and the [[John Warner sports centre]], a leisure centre on the outskirts of the town containing a swimming pool and children's activity centre.\nThere is also a [[Non-League football]] club [[Hoddesdon Town F.C.]], which plays at Lowfield, and a large go-kart track located in nearby Rye park.
