''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'' is a herbaceous [[perennial]] plant with heads of white, pink or yellow flowers, grown as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s.\n\n==Scientific Name==\nThe [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic genus]] ''Stellera'' (not to be confused with the entirely unrelated ''[[Stellaria]]'') commemorates [[Georg Wilhelm Steller]] (St\u00f6ller), while the specific epithet ''chamaejasme'' is a rendering into botanical Latin orthography of the Greek\n''khamai'' \"(down) on the ground\" and ''iasme'' \"[[jasmine]]. The name in its entirety thus means \"Steller's plant that resembles a kind of jasmine (that creeps) on the ground\".\n\n==Description==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is a [[herbaceous perennial]]. Unbranched stems, 20\u201330&nbsp;cm tall, emerge in a cluster from an underground [[rhizome]]. Narrow, overlapping leaves are borne along the stems. Individual leaves are narrow and pointed, up to 2&nbsp;cm long. The flowers are grouped into rounded tightly packed terminal heads. Flowers lack [[petal]]s, instead having petaloid [[sepal]]s forming a tube up to 1.5&nbsp;cm long with usually five (but possibly four or six) short lobes at the end. The flower colour varies from shades of pink and white to yellow. There are twice as many stamens as calyx lobes, in two series. The ovary has a single chamber ([[locule]]). The fruit is a dry [[drupe]], enclosed by the remains of the calyx.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_S/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus ''Stellera'' was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753.<ref name=IPNI_39323-1/>  He recognized two species: ''Stellera passerina'', now placed in the genus ''[[Thymelaea]]'' as ''[[Thymelaea passerina|T.&nbsp;passerina]]'', and ''Stellera chamaejasme''.<ref name=Linn53/> Many species names were later created in the genus, but all are now usually considered synonyms of other species, including ''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'',<ref name=TPL_Stellera/> although the ''Flora of China'' states that there are 10 to 12 species.<ref name=FoC_S/>\n\nStudies in 2002 and 2009, based on [[chloroplast DNA]], placed ''Stellera'' in a small group of related genera, either as sister to ''[[Wikstroemia]]'' or embedded within it; however for most genera only one species was included.<ref name=BankFayChas02/><ref name=BeauEdwaMannMaur09/>\n\n{{clade|style=line-height:100%\n|1={{clade\n   |1=''[[Edgeworthia]]''\n   |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=''[[Wikstroemia]]''\n         |2=''Stellera''\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=''[[Diarthron]]''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Thymelaea]]''\n            |2=''[[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]]''\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is native to northern China, Tibet, the Himalayas (Nepal, Bhutan), Uttar Pradesh in India, and Russia and Mongolia.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_Sc/> In China, it is found on sunny dry slopes and sandy places between 2600 and 4200&nbsp;m.<ref name=FoC_Sc/>\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is cultivated as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s. It is considered difficult to grow, needing a sunny position and gritty soil if grown outside, or a large pot if grown under cover. It is propagated by seed.<ref name=Beck94/>\n\n==Toxicity==\n[[File:Chamaejasme.jpg|thumb|Compared and contrasted: roots of (fancied) human-like form of A: ''Stellera chamaejasme'' and B: ''[[Mandragora officinarum]]'', the fabled ''Mandrake''.

This root resembles a crudely-carved human figure to a degree even greater than that of the [ famous ] ''Alraune'' or [[Mandrake|Mandragora]], such that one can often distinguish clearly in its natural form [protuberances resembling] a head, arms and legs; which has led to its being given the most apposite name of ''Muzhik koren'' [\u041c\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043a \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d] or \"Man root\" by the Russians. The oldest rootstocks of this plant can reach the size of a large carrot, and [if taken as medicine] produce the most violent effects. Such old roots can produce more than fifty - and sometimes as many as a hundred - flowering shoots, which, crowned with their beautiful and fragrant flowers, give not the least hint of the violent and pernicious effects residing in the root that bore them. The exterior of the flower is usually of a dark reddish-purple, or, more rarely [[sulphur]]-yellow colour; while the interior is white. Add to this the fact that the flowers display, upon opening, a white border and in the middle a red or yellow patch, and the flowers present the most [[Beauty|ravishing]] aspect. The young [[Evenk|Tungus]] boys are in the habit of adorning their bare heads with a kind of hat which they create most artistically by interweaving whole flowering stems of the plant. On this plant one often finds a flower in which two normal flowers seem fused into one, bearing a corolla with nine lobes and eighteen stamens arranged in two rows.
