[[List of awards and nominations received by Amy Adams|Her accolades]] include two [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]], and nominations for six [[Academy Awards]] and seven [[British Academy Film Awards]].\n\nBorn in [[Vicenza|Vicenza, Italy]], and raised in [[Castle Rock, Colorado]], Adams is the fourth of seven siblings. She trained to be a ballerina, but at age 18, she found musical theater a better fit, and from 1994 to 1998, she worked in [[dinner theater]]. She made her feature film debut with a supporting part in the 1999 satire ''[[Drop Dead Gorgeous (film)|Drop Dead Gorgeous]]''. After moving to Los Angeles, she made guest appearances in television and took on \"mean girl\" parts in small-scale features. Her first major role came in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 2002 biopic ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', opposite [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], but she was unemployed for a year afterward. Her breakthrough came in the part of a loquacious pregnant woman in the 2005 independent film ''[[Junebug (film)|Junebug]]''.\n\nThe 2007 musical ''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]]'', in which Adams played a cheerful princess, was her first major success as a leading lady. She followed it by playing na\u00efve, optimistic women in a series of films such as the 2008 drama ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]''. She subsequently played stronger parts to positive reviews in the sports film ''[[The Fighter]]'' (2010) and the psychological drama ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]'' (2012). In 2013, she began portraying [[Lois Lane]] in superhero films set in the [[DC Extended Universe]]. She won two consecutive [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress]] for playing a seductive con artist in the crime film ''[[American Hustle]]'' (2013) and the painter [[Margaret Keane]] in the biopic ''[[Big Eyes]]'' (2014). Further acclaim came for playing a linguist in the science fiction film ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'' (2016), a self-harming reporter in the miniseries ''[[Sharp Objects (miniseries)|Sharp Objects]]'' (2018), and [[Lynne Cheney]] in the satirical film ''[[Vice (2018 film)|Vice]]'' (2018).\n\nAdams's stage roles include [[the Public Theater]]'s revival of ''[[Into the Woods]]'' in 2012, in which she played the Baker's Wife. In 2014, she was named one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and featured in the [[Forbes Celebrity 100|''Forbes'' Celebrity 100]] list. She is married to actor and artist Darren Le Gallo, with whom she has a daughter.\n\n==Early life==\nAmy Lou Adams was born on August 20, 1974, to American parents Richard and Kathryn Adams, when her father was stationed with the [[United States Army]] at the [[Caserma Ederle]] military complex in [[Vicenza]], Italy.<ref name=\"biography-com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/amy-adams-20883223 |title=Amy Adams Biography: Actress (1974) |publisher=[[Biography (TV program)|Biography]] |access-date=December 23, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113135641/http://www.biography.com/people/amy-adams-20883223 |archive-date=January 13, 2015 |df=}}</ref><ref name=\"VF-2008nov\">{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Shnayerson|author-link=Michael Shnayerson|title=Some Enchanted Amy|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/11/amyadams200811|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=December 18, 2008|access-date=December 31, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218105250/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/11/amyadams200811|archive-date=December 18, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> She is the middle of seven children, with four brothers and two sisters.<ref name=\"TDT-2007nov16\">{{cite news|first=Naomi |last=West |title=Amy Adams: Happily ever after |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669358/Amy-Adams-Happily-ever-after.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=November 16, 2007 |access-date=December 31, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214212134/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669358/Amy-Adams-Happily-ever-after.html |archive-date=February 14, 2009 |df=}}</ref> After moving from one army base to another, Adams's family settled in [[Castle Rock, Colorado]], when she was eight.<ref name=\"VF-2008nov\"/> After leaving the army, her father sang professionally in nightclubs and restaurants.<ref name=\"TDT-2007nov16\"/><ref name=\"esquire\">{{cite news|last=Bilmes|first=Alex|url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film/news/a5469/amy-adams-interview-esquire-american-hustle/|title=Amy Adams Interview: Esquire Meets The Star Of 'American Hustle'|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=December 18, 2013|access-date=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921144022/http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film/news/a5469/amy-adams-interview-esquire-american-hustle/|archive-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref> Adams has described going to her father's shows and drinking [[Shirley Temple (drink)|Shirley Temples]] at the bar as among her fondest childhood memories.<ref name=\"TOCR-2007nov17\">{{cite news|first=Barry |last=Koltnow |title='Enchanted' with Amy Adams. |url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/entertainment/abox/article_1924507.php |work=[[The Orange County Register]] |date=November 17, 2007 |access-date=December 31, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120052642/http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/entertainment/abox/article_1924507.php |archive-date=November 20, 2007 |df=}}</ref> The family was poor;

She made her feature film debut with a supporting part in the 1999 satire ''[[Drop Dead Gorgeous (film)|Drop Dead Gorgeous]]''. After moving to Los Angeles, she made guest appearances in television and took on \"mean girl\" parts in small-scale features.

She followed it by playing na\u00efve, optimistic women in a series of films such as the 2008 drama ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]''. She subsequently played stronger parts to positive reviews in the sports film ''[[The Fighter]]'' (2010) and the psychological drama ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]'' (2012). In 2013, she began portraying [[Lois Lane]] in superhero films set in the [[DC Extended Universe]]. She won two consecutive [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress]] for playing a seductive con artist in the crime film ''[[American Hustle]]'' (2013) and the painter [[Margaret Keane]] in the biopic ''[[Big Eyes]]'' (2014). Further acclaim came for playing a linguist in the science fiction film ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'' (2016), a self-harming reporter in the miniseries ''[[Sharp Objects (miniseries)|Sharp Objects]]'' (2018), and [[Lynne Cheney]] in the satirical film ''[[Vice (2018 film)|Vice]]'' (2018).\n\nAdams's stage roles include [[the Public Theater]]'s revival of ''[[Into the Woods]]'' in 2012, in which she played the Baker's Wife.

In it, Billie sings lines like: \"I don't wanna be lonely\" and \"I can't lose another life\". She also appears to reference a failed relationship by adding: \"I just wanted to protect you, but now I'll never get to.\" The person is afraid that their loved one will depart and never return. The person believes that the love they share is incomparable to what he will find in the outside world. Ultimately the song finishes with the chorus, where the person has been realized they are alone and their loved one is gone. The person is unaware of their location and wonders if they'll ever return. The persons desire for their loved one to \u201ccome home\u201d is so strong that they don't even care if they are such under false pretenses. <ref>{{cite web|last=Prance|first=Sam|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/music/news/billie-eilish-ilomilo-lyrics-meaning/|title=Billie Eilish reveals the adorable story and meaning behind her 'ilomilo' lyrics|work=PopBuzz|date=March 29, 2019|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> The song is introduced during the final seconds of \"Bury a Friend.\" There are lyrical reference to \"Bury a Friend\" in \"Ilomilo\": \"The friends I've had to bury, they keep me up at night\".

In it, Billie sings lines like: \"I don't wanna be lonely\" and \"I can't lose another life\". She also appears to reference a failed relationship by adding: \"I just wanted to protect you, but now I'll never get to.\" The person is afraid that their loved one will depart and never return. The person believes that the love they share is incomparable to what he will find in the outside world. Ultimately the song finishes with the chorus, where the person has been realized they are alone and their loved one is gone. The person is unaware of their location and wonders if they'll ever return. The persons desire for their loved one to \u201ccome home\u201d is so strong that they don't even care if they are such under false pretenses. <ref>{{cite web|last=Prance|first=Sam|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/music/news/billie-eilish-ilomilo-lyrics-meaning/|title=Billie Eilish reveals the adorable story and meaning behind her 'ilomilo' lyrics|work=PopBuzz|date=March 29, 2019|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> The song is introduced during the final seconds of \"Bury a Friend.\" There are lyrical reference to \"Bury a Friend\" in \"Ilomilo\": \"The friends I've had to bury, they keep me up at night\".
