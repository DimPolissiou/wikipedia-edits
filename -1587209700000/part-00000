He has continued to represent his electorate as an independent MP.\n\n== Electoral system ==\n{{main|Electoral system of New Zealand}}\n\nNew Zealand uses the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) voting system to elect the House of Representatives. Each voter gets two votes, one for a political party (the party vote) and one for a local candidate (the electorate vote). Political parties which meet the threshold (5% of the party vote or one electorate seat) receive seats in the House in proportion to the percentage of the party vote they receive. 72 of the 120 seats are filled by the MPs elected from the [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]], with the winner in each electorate determined by the [[first-past-the-post voting|first past the post method]] (i.e. most votes wins). The remaining 48 seats are filled by candidates from each party's closed [[party list]]. If a party wins more electorates than seats it is entitled to under the party vote, an [[overhang seat|overhang]] results; in this case, the House will add extra seats to cover the overhang.\n\nThe political party or party bloc with the majority of the seats in the House forms the [[Government of New Zealand|Government]]. Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, no party has won enough votes to win an outright majority of seats. As a result, parties must negotiate with other parties to form a [[coalition government]] or a [[minority government]].\n\n===Electorate boundaries===\n[[File:New Zealand electorate popualtion change, 2018 census.svg|thumb|300x300px|The 2014 electoral boundaries showing electorates out of tolerance following the 2018 census and M\u0101ori electoral option.

Only money from the broadcasting allocation can be used to purchase airtime; the actual production costs of advertisements can come from the general election expenses budget.

He has continued to represent his electorate as an independent MP.\n\n== Electoral system ==\n{{main|Electoral system of New Zealand}}\n\nNew Zealand uses the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) voting system to elect the House of Representatives. Each voter gets two votes, one for a political party (the party vote) and one for a local candidate (the electorate vote). Political parties which meet the threshold (5% of the party vote or one electorate seat) receive seats in the House in proportion to the percentage of the party vote they receive. 72 of the 120 seats are filled by the MPs elected from the [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]], with the winner in each electorate determined by the [[first-past-the-post voting|first past the post method]] (i.e. most votes wins). The remaining 48 seats are filled by candidates from each party's closed [[party list]]. If a party wins more electorates than seats it is entitled to under the party vote, an [[overhang seat|overhang]] results; in this case, the House will add extra seats to cover the overhang.\n\nThe political party or party bloc with the majority of the seats in the House forms the [[Government of New Zealand|Government]]. Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, no party has won enough votes to win an outright majority of seats. As a result, parties must negotiate with other parties to form a [[coalition government]] or a [[minority government]].\n\n===Electorate boundaries===\n[[File:New Zealand electorate popualtion change, 2018 census.svg|thumb|300x300px|The 2014 electoral boundaries showing electorates out of tolerance following the 2018 census and M\u0101ori electoral option.

The writs must be returned within 50 days of their issuance (save for any judicial recount or death of a candidate), which would be 7 December 2020.<ref name=legislation1>{{cite web |url= http://legislation.co.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM309482.html |title=Electoral Act 1993, Sec. 139 |date=17 August 2011 |website=Legislation.co.nz |accessdate=22 October 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160629065145/http://legislation.co.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM309482.html#DLM309482 |archivedate=29 June 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Because polling day must be on a Saturday,<ref name=legislation1/> and two weeks is generally required for the counting of special votes, the last possible date for the next general election is 21 November 2020.\n\nOn 28 January 2020, Ardern announced that the election will be held on 19 September,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/118983011/jacinda-ardern-announces-2020-election-will-be-held-on-september-19 |title=Jacinda Ardern announces 2020 election will be held on September 19 |first1=Luke |last1=Malpass |first2=Henry |last2=Cooke |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=28 January 2020 |accessdate=28 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128021549/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/118983011/jacinda-ardern-announces-2020-election-will-be-held-on-september-19 |archive-date=28 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> with the {{show by date|2020|9|19|current|52nd}} parliament holding its last sitting day on 6 August and dissolving on 12 August.<ref name=\"election date\"/>\n\nThe date of 19 September was announced before the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand|COVID-19 pandemic had reached New Zealand]].

For the 2019/20 fiscal year, every registered party contending the party vote is permitted to spend [[NZD|$]]1,169,000 on election campaigning during the regulated period, excluding radio and television campaigning (broadcasting funding is allocated separately). Additionally, all electorate candidates are permitted to spend $27,500 each on campaigning over and above their party's allocation.<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 205(c).</ref> A party contesting all 72 electorates is therefore permitted to spend $3,149,000 on election campaigning.<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 206(c).</ref>\n\nRegistered parties are allocated a separate broadcasting budget for radio and television campaigning. Only money from the broadcasting allocation can be used to purchase airtime; the actual production costs of advertisements can come from the general election expenses budget.

The name may also refer to a [[carbonate ester]], an organic compound containing the '''carbonate [[functional group|group]]''' C(=O)(O\u2013)<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe term is also used as a verb, to describe [[carbonation]]: the process of raising the concentrations of carbonate and [[bicarbonate]] ions in water to produce [[carbonated water]] and other carbonated beverages{{snd}}either by the addition of [[carbon dioxide]] gas under pressure, or by dissolving carbonate or bicarbonate salts into the water.\n\nIn [[geology]] and [[mineralogy]], the term \"carbonate\" can refer both to [[carbonate minerals]] and [[carbonate rock]] (which is made of chiefly carbonate minerals), and both are dominated by the carbonate ion, {{chem|CO|3|2-}}. Carbonate minerals are extremely varied and ubiquitous in chemically precipitated [[sedimentary rock]]. The most common are [[calcite]] or [[calcium carbonate]], CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the chief constituent of [[limestone]] (as well as the main component of [[mollusc]] shells and [[coral]] skeletons); [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]], a calcium-magnesium carbonate CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>; and [[siderite]], or [[iron]](II) carbonate, FeCO<sub>3</sub>, an important [[iron ore]]. [[Sodium carbonate]] (\"soda\" or \"natron\") and [[potassium carbonate]] (\"potash\") have been used since antiquity for cleaning and preservation, as well as for the manufacture of [[glass]]. Carbonates are widely used in industry, e.g. in iron smelting, as a raw material for [[Portland cement]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]] manufacture, in the composition of [[ceramic glaze]]s, and more.\n\n==Structure and bonding==\n\nThe [https://www.draughtsmancivilnotes.in/2020/04/rock-forming-minerals.html carbonate] ion is the simplest [[oxocarbon anion]]. It consists of one [[carbon]] atom surrounded by three [[oxygen]] atoms, in a [[trigonal planar]] arrangement, with ''D''<sub>3h</sub> [[Molecular symmetry#Point Group|molecular symmetry]].

In solution this equilibrium between carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide and carbonic acid changes constantly to the changing temperature and pressure conditions. In the case of metal ions with insoluble carbonates, e.g. CaCO<sub>3</sub>, formation of insoluble compounds results.

By the same principle, when the pH is too high, the kidneys excrete bicarbonate ({{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}) into urine as urea via the [[urea cycle]] (or Krebs\u2013Henseleit ornithine cycle).

It is a major factor in climate change and the long-term carbon cycle, due to the large number of marine organisms (especially coral) which are formed of calcium carbonate. Increased solubility of carbonate through increased temperatures results in lower production of marine [[calcite]] and increased concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. This, in turn, increases Earth temperature. The tonnage of {{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}} is on a geological scale and may all be redissolved into the sea and released to the atmosphere, increasing CO<sub>2</sub> levels even more.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Carbonate salts==\n{{see also|Category:Carbonates}}\n\n* Carbonate overview:\n{{Carbonates}}\n\n==Presence outside Earth==\nIt is generally thought that the presence of carbonates in [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is strong evidence for the presence of liquid water.

Officially declared dead in the files of by their respective agencies, Tiger and Zoya are now married and have a son, Junior. The world believes that they have seen the last of Tiger and Zoya when danger strikes in the form of a powerful, yet an unknown enemy, throwing their life in a chaos.\n\nDuring a dark night in [[Iraq]], an American journalist types a warning message to [[CIA]] before he is slaughtered by some [[ISIS|ISC]] guards. While carrying a rally in [[Tikrit|Ikrit]], ISC leader Abu Usman is shot in the arm by the [[Iraqi Army]] and taken to the city hospital. Abu Usman [[Foreign hostages in Iraq#India|holds hostage of the Indian and Pakistani nurses]] and makes the hospital as his base. The US military decides to launch an airstike at the city to kill Usman. Indian nurse Maria calls the Indian Ambassador to Iraq at the Indian Embassy in [[Baghdad]], informing about the incident.\n\nThe CIA give RAW chairman Shenoy seven days of time to rescue the nurses after which they will hold the airstrike. Shenoy feels that only Tiger would be able to rescue the nurses. Based on the clues available, Shenoy locates Tiger and Zoya in [[Innsbruck]]. Several days later, Tiger is briefed by Shenoy, who informs him about the abduction of nurses. However Shenoy only tells Tiger about the 25 Indian nurses held in Iraq. Though Tiger is reluctant at first, he sets to carry the mission after Zoya's insistence.\n\nTiger travels to [[Syria]] and assembles his own gang of RAW members consisting of Azaan, an expert [[sniper]], Namit, an experienced [[bomb disposal|bomb disposer]] and Rakesh, a [[hacker]]. They reach an oil refinery controlled by Al Amir Baghdawi (Sal Yusuf), ISC's second-in-command, but face difficulty after the arrival of Firdauz aka 'Tohbaan' ('snake' in [[Arabic]]), who checks the workers. One day, Tiger rescues Hassan (Jineet Rath), a child who is sent by Usman as a [[Suicide Bomber|human bomb]]. That night, Tiger and his gang set a [[controlled explosion]] in the refinery and pretend to get burned so that they are taken to the hospital.\n\nEn route, they are joined by ISI members Captain Abrar and Captain Javed. Zoya also comes along with Abrar and Javed and reveals to Tiger that along with 25 Indian nurses, 15 Pakistani nurses are held hostage. Tiger then declares that ISI and RAW will work together to rescue the nurses. Meanwhile, Firdauz reveals that he is a secret RAW agent. They go to the hospital while Zoya leaves Tiger to first kill Baghdavi and his troops which she does with the help of some [[Syrians|Syrian girls]].\n\nAt the hospital, Rakesh poisons the food. On the day of the airstrike, Usman's troops are [[food poisoning|food poisoned]]. Tiger fights the troops but finds Usman with Zoya which causes him to surrender. Tiger is tortured in a [[gas chamber]] but later escapes and rescues the nurses. Azaan dies during the fight. As they escape, Firdauz and Karan who is also a RAW member and Shenoy's most trusted person crashes an oil tanker which kills ISC members.\n\nTiger stabs and wounds Usman along with Sayem Noman in a fierce encounter and moves to rescue Zoya who insists Tiger to leave her for the sake of Junior Sayem Noman. A missile, launched by American drones, blows the chamber. Tiger dresses everyone in the execution robes for a safe passage out of Ikrit. Javed raises Indian and Pakistani flags above the bus with the nurses keeping Azaan's promise while Firdauz takes Usman to a desert and shoots him.\n\nOne year later, Shenoy is called by Tiger from [[Greece]]. A flashback shows that Tiger broke the chain and rescued Zoya and escaped, knowing that RAW and ISI wouldn't leave them be if they returned with the nurses. It's revealed that Tiger and Zoya have adopted Hassan. Though Tiger goes into hiding once again, he assures Shenoy that he will always be there for his country.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Salman Khan]] as RAW Officer Avinash \"Tiger\" Singh Rathore<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-paresh-rawal-to-join-team-tiger-zinda-hai-2346741|title=Paresh Rawal to join Team 'Tiger Zinda Hai'|newspaper=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Katrina Kaif]] as ISI officer Zoya Singh Rathore, Tiger's wife<ref>{{cite news|url=https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/daily+post-epaper-dpost/gavie+chahal+says+punjabi+film+industry+badly+needs+professional+film+makers-newsid-74376129 |title= Gavie Chahal says Punjabi film industry badly needs professional film makers|publisher=Daily Hunt|accessdate=6 October 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Sajjad Delafrooz]]<ref name=\"abuusman\"/> as Abu Usman\n*[[Paresh Rawal]] as Firdous aka Tohbaan, main RAW agent of Iraq<ref name=\"IBT Paresh Rawal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/bollywood/tiger-zinda-hai-adds-paresh-rawal-to-its-cast-yrf-ropes-in-the-dark-knight-action-director-3324694.html|title=Tiger Zinda Hai adds Paresh Rawal to its cast|publisher=|accessdate=9 March 2017|date=9 March 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Angad Bedi]] as Namit Khanna, a trained expert in defusing bombs<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/angad-bedi-kicked-about-working-with-salman-khan-in-tiger-zinda-hai/story-8Nzsvz8Wue9dvpjaZUKjqO.html|title=Angad Bedi kicked about working with Salman Khan in Tiger Zinda Hai|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=27 April 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Kumud Mishra]] as Rakesh Prajapati\n*[[Girish Karnad]] as Shenoy\n*Sal Yusuf as Al Amir Baghdawi\n*Paresh Pahuja as Azaan Akbar\n*[[Neha Hinge]] as Maria\n*[[Gavie Chahal]] as Captain Abrar\n*[[Anupriya Goenka]] as a nurse, Poorna\n*[[Kashmira Irani]] as Pakistani Nurse Sana\n*[[Anant Vidhaat Sharma]] as Karan\n*[[Ivan Sylvester Rodrigues|Ivan Rodrigues]] as India's Ambassador to Iraq\n*[[Siddhartha Basu]] as Indian Defence Minister.\n*[[Anjana Om Kashyap]] as Herself, an Indian TV reporter\n*Danish Bhatt as Captain Javed\n*Rohit KaduDeshmukh as Captain Gautam\n*Khalida Jan Touray as Pakistani Nurse Naghma \n*[[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Pawan\n*Zachary Coffin as Gary \n*Casey Shannon as Sam Jacobs\n*Najmeddin Al Hadad as Hakim\n*Vibhoutee Sharma as Jiya\n*Sartaaj Kakkar as Junior\n*Jineet Rath as Hasaan\n*Nimash Dulantha\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]], [[Austria]], [[Greece]] and [[Morocco]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/tiger-zinda-hai-trailer-salman-khan-katrina-kaifs-roar-is-what-you-just-heard-1772149|title=Tiger Zinda Hai Trailer: Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif's 'Roar' Is What You Just Heard|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=7 November 2017|publisher=NDTV}}</ref> The last song of the movie was shot in the Aegean island of [[Naxos]], Greece in October 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://elinepa.org/en/tiger-zinda-hai/|title=Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif in Greece for the shooting of their film ''Tiger Zinda Hai''|accessdate=19 October 2017|publisher=www.elinepa.org}}</ref> Iranian actor Sajjad Delafrooz was roped in to play the role of Abu Usman, leader of terrorist organisation ISC.<ref name=\"abuusman\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/tiger-zinda-hai-villain-sajjad-delfrooz-salman-katrina-1080725-2017-11-07|title=Who is Tiger Zinda Hai villain?

Officially declared dead in the files of by their respective agencies, Tiger and Zoya are now married and have a son, Junior. The world believes that they have seen the last of Tiger and Zoya when danger strikes in the form of a powerful, yet an unknown enemy, throwing their life in a chaos.\n\nDuring a dark night in [[Iraq]], an American journalist types a warning message to [[CIA]] before he is slaughtered by some [[ISIS|ISC]] guards. While carrying a rally in [[Tikrit|Ikrit]], ISC leader Abu Usman is shot in the arm by the [[Iraqi Army]] and taken to the city hospital. Abu Usman [[Foreign hostages in Iraq#India|holds hostage of the Indian and Pakistani nurses]] and makes the hospital as his base. The US military decides to launch an airstike at the city to kill Usman. Indian nurse Maria calls the Indian Ambassador to Iraq at the Indian Embassy in [[Baghdad]], informing about the incident.\n\nThe CIA give RAW chairman Shenoy seven days of time to rescue the nurses after which they will hold the airstrike. Shenoy feels that only Tiger would be able to rescue the nurses. Based on the clues available, Shenoy locates Tiger and Zoya in [[Innsbruck]]. Several days later, Tiger is briefed by Shenoy, who informs him about the abduction of nurses. However Shenoy only tells Tiger about the 25 Indian nurses held in Iraq. Though Tiger is reluctant at first, he sets to carry the mission after Zoya's insistence.\n\nTiger travels to [[Syria]] and assembles his own gang of RAW members consisting of Azaan, an expert [[sniper]], Namit, an experienced [[bomb disposal|bomb disposer]] and Rakesh, a [[hacker]]. They reach an oil refinery controlled by Al Amir Baghdawi (Sal Yusuf), ISC's second-in-command, but face difficulty after the arrival of Firdauz aka 'Tohbaan' ('snake' in [[Arabic]]), who checks the workers. One day, Tiger rescues Hassan (Jineet Rath), a child who is sent by Usman as a [[Suicide Bomber|human bomb]]. That night, Tiger and his gang set a [[controlled explosion]] in the refinery and pretend to get burned so that they are taken to the hospital.\n\nEn route, they are joined by ISI members Captain Abrar and Captain Javed. Zoya also comes along with Abrar and Javed and reveals to Tiger that along with 25 Indian nurses, 15 Pakistani nurses are held hostage. Tiger then declares that ISI and RAW will work together to rescue the nurses. Meanwhile, Firdauz reveals that he is a secret RAW agent. They go to the hospital while Zoya leaves Tiger to first kill Baghdavi and his troops which she does with the help of some [[Syrians|Syrian girls]].\n\nAt the hospital, Rakesh poisons the food. On the day of the airstrike, Usman's troops are [[food poisoning|food poisoned]]. Tiger fights the troops but finds Usman with Zoya which causes him to surrender. Tiger is tortured in a [[gas chamber]] but later escapes and rescues the nurses. Azaan dies during the fight. As they escape, Firdauz and Karan who is also a RAW member and Shenoy's most trusted person crashes an oil tanker which kills ISC members.\n\nTiger stabs and wounds Usman along with Sayem Noman in a fierce encounter and moves to rescue Zoya who insists Tiger to leave her for the sake of Junior Sayem Noman. A missile, launched by American drones, blows the chamber. Tiger dresses everyone in the execution robes for a safe passage out of Ikrit. Javed raises Indian and Pakistani flags above the bus with the nurses keeping Azaan's promise while Firdauz takes Usman to a desert and shoots him.\n\nOne year later, Shenoy is called by Tiger from [[Greece]].
