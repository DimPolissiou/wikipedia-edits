The one-child policy is a factor behind this development. According to the Chinese Central Government, the one-child policy prevented approximately 400 million births. Experts continue to debate this figure, however. Some argue that such a drop in fertility is typical for a rapidly industrializing country while others believe it actually accelerates the aging process. According to demographer Zhen Binwen of the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], China's labor force would peak in 2015. Almost 7% of China's population were 65 years or older in 2000, a benchmark after which the United Nations considers a population to be aging. China is in fact aging quite quickly. UN figures show that China's ratio of people aged 60 and over increased 3.8% between 2000 and 2010, higher than the global average of 3% between 1950 and 2010. Therefore, China is one of the developing countries with aging populations. The nation's quickly growing and export-driven economy will slow down, as the advantage of abundant and cheap labor fades away. Life expectancy in China rose from 43 in 1960 to 3 in 2010, thanks to improved standards of living, better nutrition, and access to healthcare and education.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Zhang|first=Wei|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-19572056|title=Ageing China: Changes and challenges|date=September 20, 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=February 15, 2020|url-status=live|department=Asia}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of cultural ideals, government policy, and modern medicine, there have been severe gender imbalances in China and India.

By the late 1960s or 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a \"correction,\" such a rebound never came. Despite a bump in the [[total fertility rate]]<nowiki/>s (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and Scandinavia, they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. At first, falling fertility is due to urbanization and decreased infant mortality rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist [[Gary Becker]] argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural elites. (This is the [[Demographic transition#Second demographic transition|second demographic transition]].) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s had leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility that cemented itself in subsequent demographic cohorts. Member states of the European Community saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the industrialized world found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed.<ref name=\":232\">{{Cite book|title=Whither the Child?

At first sight, it appears that this might be due to their socially progressive values and policies, i.e. making it easier for women to pursue both their careers and reproductive dreams. However, closer scrutiny suggests the argument that \"feminism is the new pro-natalism\" is untenable, given that there are socially progressive countries with low fertility rates such as Austria and Canada on one hand, and more conservative and traditionalist countries with high fertility rates such as Ireland and the United States on the other.<ref name=\":232\" />\n[[File:Population pyramid of the European Union 2016.png|thumb|350x350px|Population pyramid of the European Union in 2016|alt=]]\nAt the start of the twenty-first century, Europe has a population aging at an unprecedented rate. It is estimated that by 2050, 40% of Europeans will be over the age of 60. This problem is especially acute in the East whereas in the West, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been to non-European parents. Because children of immigrants in Europe tend to be about as religious as they are, this could slow the decline of religion (or the growth of secularism) in the continent as the twenty-first century progresses.<ref name=\":21\">{{Cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Kaufmann|date=Winter 2010|title=Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?|journal=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review|volume=99|issue=396, the future of religion|pages=387\u201394|jstor=27896504}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the number of foreign-born residents stood at 6% of the population in 1991.

The fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having a lot of children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the Great Recession of 2007-8, with the youth unemployment rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad \u2013 150,000 did in 2018 \u2013 and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them. Only Japan has an age structure more tilted towards the elderly. One solution to this problem is incentivizing reproduction, as France has done, by investing in longer parental leaves, daycare, and tax exemptions for parents. As of 2019, France has approximately the same population as Italy but 65% more births. Another solution is immigration, which has been alleviating the decline, but it does not come without political backlash.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-italy-rising-anxiety-over-falling-birth-rates|title=In Italy, rising anxiety over falling birth rates|last=Livesay|first=Christopher|date=November 25, 2019|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGreece also suffers from a serious demographic problem as many young people are leaving the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere.

In 2011, five percent of Canadian children below the age of ten lived with a grandparent, up from 3.3% in the previous decade. This is in part because Canadian parents in early twenty-first century cannot (or think they cannot) afford childcare and often find themselves having to work long hours or irregular shifts. Meanwhile, many grandparents struggle to keep up with their highly active grandchildren on a regular basis due to their age. Between grandparents and parents, potential sources of friction include the diets of the children, their sleep schedule, how to discipline them, and how they may use electronic gadgets. Parents today are more reliant on the Internet for information than their own parents, and many even recommend that they take grandparenting classes.

In the 2010s, among the residents of Australia, 5% were born in the United Kingdom, 2.5% from China, 2.2% from India, and 1.1% from the Philippines. 84% of new arrivals in the fiscal year of 2016 were below 40 years of age, compared to 54% of those already in the country. Like other immigrant-friendly countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Australia's working-age population is expected to grow till about 2025. However, the ratio of people of working age to retirees (the [[dependency ratio]]) has gone from eight in the 1970s to about four in the 2010s. It could drop to two by the 2060s, depending in immigration levels.<ref name=\":25\">{{Cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/australia-demographic-time-bomb-arrived-193400024.html|title=Australia's Demographic 'Time Bomb' Has Arrived|last=Fensom|first=Anthony|date=December 1, 2019|work=The National Interest|access-date=December 24, 2019|url-status=live|publisher=Yahoo!

Students from China and Singapore, both outside of the OECD, continued to outclass their global peers. Among all the countries that sent their students to take the PISA, only Albania, Colombia, Macao, Moldova, Peru, Portugal, and Qatar saw any improvements since joining. Of these, only Portugal is an OECD country. Meanwhile, Australia, Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Slovakia, and South Korea all saw a decline in overall performance since joining. Funding, while important, is not necessarily the most important thing, as the case of Estonia demonstrates. Estonia spent 30% below the OECD average yet still achieved top marks.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oecd-education/education-levels-stagnating-despite-higher-spending-oecd-survey-idUSKBN1Y70Q8|title=Education levels stagnating despite higher spending: OECD survey|last=Thomas|first=Leigh|date=December 3, 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=February 5, 2020|url-status=live|department=World News}}</ref>\n\nSocioeconomic background is a key factor in academic success in the OECD, with students coming from families in the top 10% of the income distribution being three years ahead in reading skills compared to those from the bottom 10%.

However, Swedish students typically graduate with a lot of debt due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm. The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite widespread concern over rising student debt, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008-9 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a government agency known as the [[National Board of Student Aid (Sweden)|Centrala Studiest\u00f6dsn\u00e4mnden]] (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the 2008-9 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995. In the United States, there was an increase in the former but not the latter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/the-high-price-of-a-free-college-education-in-sweden/276428/|title=The High Price of a Free College Education in Sweden|last=Philips|first=Matt|date=May 31, 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=November 4, 2019|department=Global}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, judges in Karlsruhe, Germany, struck down a ban on university fees as unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the constitutional right of German states to regulate their own higher education systems. This ban was introduced in order to ensure equality of access to higher education regardless of socioeconomic class. Bavarian Science Minister Thomas Goppel told the Associated Press, \"Fees will help to preserve the quality of universities.\" Supporters of fees argued that they would help ease the financial burden on universities and would incentivize students to study more efficiently, despite not covering the full cost of higher education, an average of \u20ac8,500 as of 2005.

Known as the ''Service National Universel'' or SNU ([[:fr:Service national universel]]), it is a compulsory civic service. While students will not have to shave their heads or handle military equipment, they will have to sleep in tents, get up early (at 6:30 am), participate in various physical activities, raise the [[Flag of France|tricolor]], and sing the [[La Marseillaise|national anthem]]. They will have to wear a uniform, though it is more akin to the outfit of security guards rather than military personnel. This program takes a total of four weeks. In the first two, youths learn how to provide first aid, how navigating with a map, how to recognize fake news, emergency responses for various scenarios, and self-defense. In addition, they get health checks and get tested on their mastery of the French language, and they participate in debates on a variety of social issues, including environmentalism, state secularism, and gender equality. In the second fortnight, they volunteer with a charity for local government. The aim of this program is to promote national cohesion and patriotism, at a time of deep division on religious and political grounds, to get people out of their neighborhoods and regions, and mix people of different socioeconomic classes, something mandatory military service used to do. Supporters thought that teenagers rarely raise the national flag, spend too much time on their phones, and felt nostalgic for the era of compulsory military service, considered a rite of passage for young men and a tool of character-building. Critics argued that this program is inadequate, and would cost too much.<ref name=\":6\" /> The SNU is projected to affect some 800,000 French citizens each year when it becomes mandatory for all aged 16 to 21 by 2026, at a cost of some \u20ac1.6 billion.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20190711-france-civic-service-military-volunteer-french-values-macron-first-aid-national-cohesion|title=National civic service: A crash course in self-defence, emergency responses and French values|last=Villeminot|first=Florence|date=July 11, 2019|work=France 24|access-date=November 5, 2019|department=French Connection}}</ref> Another major concern is that it will overburden the French military, already stretched thin by counter-terrorism campaigns at home and abroad.<ref name=\":4\" /> A 2015 IFOP poll revealed that 80% of the French people supported some kind of mandatory service, military, or civilian.

Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the goal of having half of young Britons earning a university degree in 1999, though he missed the 2010 deadline. Demand for higher education in the United Kingdom remains strong, driven by the need for high-skilled workers from both the public and private sectors. There was, however, a widening gender gap.

'Old money' ceased to exist in China as a result of a centrally planned economy. But that changed in the 1980s when [[Deng Xiaoping]] introduced economic reforms; the middle and upper classes have blossoming ever since. In fact, he considered getting rich to be \"glorious.\" Chinese cities have morphed into major shopping centers. The number of billionaires (in U.S. dollars) in China is growing faster than anywhere else in the world, so much so that butler academies, whose students will serve the 'new rich', and [[finishing school]]s, whose students were born to rich parents, have been established. However, according to the World Bank, 27% of Chinese still live below the poverty line. The Chinese Central Government promised to end poverty by 2020. President [[Xi Jinping]]'s anti-corruption campaign also cracks down on what he considered 'ostentatious displays of wealth'.

Whereas in the past, Chinese firms copied the business strategies and models from their U.S. counterparts, now, they are developing their own approaches, and Southeast Asian companies are learning from their success and experience, a practice known as \"Copy from China.\" E-commerce has been flourishing. In Singapore, for example, not only is it now possible to place orders online, one may also purchase groceries in person, pay by mobile phone, and have them packed by machines; there are no cashiers. Whereas Westerners were first introduced to the Internet via their personal computers, people in China and Southeast Asia first got online with their mobile phones. Consequently, the e-commerce industry's heavy usage of mobile phone applications has paid off handsomely. In particular, Chinese entrepreneurs invest in what are known as \"super-apps,\" those that enable users to access all kinds of services within them, not just messaging, but also bike rentals and digital wallets. In Indonesia, relying on credit-card payments is difficult because the market penetration of this technology remains rather low (as of 2019). Nevertheless, e-commerce and ride-hailing are growing there, too. But it is Singapore that is the startup hub of the region, thanks to its excellent infrastructure, government support, and abundant capital.

However, the picture varies depending on the country. In Italy, environmentally friendly architecture is in high demand. Estonia and France are running short of legal professionals. Ireland, Luxembourg, Hungary, and the United Kingdom need more financial experts. All member states except Finland need more ICT specialists, and all but Belgium, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and the United Kingdom need more teachers. The supply of STEM graduates has been insufficient because the dropout rate is high and because of an ongoing brain drain from some countries. Some countries need more teachers because many are retiring and need to be replaced. At the same time, Europe's aging population necessitates the expansion of the healthcare sector. Disincentives for (potential) workers in jobs in high demand include low social prestige, low salaries, and stressful work environments. Indeed, many have left the public sector for industry while some STEM graduates have taken non-STEM jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/news/skill-shortages-europe-which-occupations-are-demand-and-why|title=Skill shortages in Europe: Which occupations are in demand \u2013 and why|last=|first=|date=October 25, 2016|website=Cedefop|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEven though pundits predicted that the uncertainty due to the Brexit referendum would cause the British economy to falter or even fall into a recession, the unemployment rate has dipped below 4% while real wages have risen slightly in the late 2010s, two percent as of 2019.

For example, in the cities of the Middle East, women who supported Sharia law had a 50% fertility advantage over those who opposed it the most at the turn of the century.<ref name=\":21\" /> According to the World Religious Database, the proportion of the human population identifying with a religion increased from 81% in 1970 to 85% in 2000 and is predicted to rise to 87% in 2025.

Children of immigrants tend to be about as religious as their parents and consider their religion to be a marker of their ethnic identity, thereby insulating themselves from the secularizing forces of the host society. The other engine is comparatively high fertility and religious endogamy. In France, a white Catholic woman had half a child more than her secular counterparts in the early 2000s; in Spain, that number was 0.77.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the Netherlands, the youngest villages belong to Orthodox Calvinists,<ref name=\":21\" /> who comprised 7% of the Dutch population by the early 2000s.<ref name=\":232\" /> In Austria, the number of people below the age of 15 who were Muslims rose past the 10%-mark in the first decade of the twenty-first century. In the United Kingdom, over 90% of Muslims married other Muslims by the turn of the millennium, and it is well-known that children born into an interfaith marriage tend to be less religious than their parents. Interfaith marriage is in fact a vehicle of secularization.<ref name=\":21\" /> Ultra-Orthodox Jews comprised just 12% of the British Jewish population but three quarters of Jewish births at the start of the twenty-first century. (This group is projected to make up the majority of Anglo-American Jews by 2050.)<ref name=\":232\" /> In the United States, Catholicism will become the largest religion by 2040 despite considerable losses to secularization and conversion to Protestantism thanks in no small part to the fact that Latino Catholics had a fertility rate of 2.83 compared to the national average of 2.03 in 2003.

This percentage influx may explain why more girls reported experiencing cyberbullying, decreased self-esteem, and emotional instability more than their male counterparts.\n\nOther researchers hypothesize that girls are more affected by social media usage because of ''how'' they use it. In a study conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2015, researchers discovered that while 78% girls reported to making a friend through social media, only 52% of boys could say the same.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/28/men-catch-up-with-women-on-overall-social-media-use/|title=Men catch up with women on overall social media use|date=2015-08-28|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}</ref> However, boys are not explicitly less affected by this statistic.

The one-child policy is a factor behind this development. According to the Chinese Central Government, the one-child policy prevented approximately 400 million births. Experts continue to debate this figure, however. Some argue that such a drop in fertility is typical for a rapidly industrializing country while others believe it actually accelerates the aging process. According to demographer Zhen Binwen of the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], China's labor force would peak in 2015. Almost 7% of China's population were 65 years or older in 2000, a benchmark after which the United Nations considers a population to be aging. China is in fact aging quite quickly. UN figures show that China's ratio of people aged 60 and over increased 3.8% between 2000 and 2010, higher than the global average of 3% between 1950 and 2010. Therefore, China is one of the developing countries with aging populations. The nation's quickly growing and export-driven economy will slow down, as the advantage of abundant and cheap labor fades away. Life expectancy in China rose from 43 in 1960 to 3 in 2010, thanks to improved standards of living, better nutrition, and access to healthcare and education.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Zhang|first=Wei|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-19572056|title=Ageing China: Changes and challenges|date=September 20, 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=February 15, 2020|url-status=live|department=Asia}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of cultural ideals, government policy, and modern medicine, there have been severe gender imbalances in China and India.

China had a total of 34 million excess males and India 37 million, more than the entire population of Malaysia. Together, China and India had a combined 50 million of excess males under the age of 20.

Coupled with an exceptionally long life expectancy (85 years for women and 78 for men, as of 2005) and one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, this means that by 2050, 30% of Japanese will be over the age of 60.

By the late 1960s or 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a \"correction,\" such a rebound never came. Despite a bump in the [[total fertility rate]]<nowiki/>s (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and Scandinavia, they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. At first, falling fertility is due to urbanization and decreased infant mortality rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist [[Gary Becker]] argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural elites. (This is the [[Demographic transition#Second demographic transition|second demographic transition]].) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s had leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility that cemented itself in subsequent demographic cohorts. Member states of the European Community saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the industrialized world found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed.<ref name=\":232\">{{Cite book|title=Whither the Child?

At first sight, it appears that this might be due to their socially progressive values and policies, i.e. making it easier for women to pursue both their careers and reproductive dreams. However, closer scrutiny suggests the argument that \"feminism is the new pro-natalism\" is untenable, given that there are socially progressive countries with low fertility rates such as Austria and Canada on one hand, and more conservative and traditionalist countries with high fertility rates such as Ireland and the United States on the other.<ref name=\":232\" />\n[[File:Population pyramid of the European Union 2016.png|thumb|350x350px|Population pyramid of the European Union in 2016|alt=]]\nAt the start of the twenty-first century, Europe has a population aging at an unprecedented rate. It is estimated that by 2050, 40% of Europeans will be over the age of 60. This problem is especially acute in the East whereas in the West, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been to non-European parents. Because children of immigrants in Europe tend to be about as religious as they are, this could slow the decline of religion (or the growth of secularism) in the continent as the twenty-first century progresses.<ref name=\":21\">{{Cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Kaufmann|date=Winter 2010|title=Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?|journal=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review|volume=99|issue=396, the future of religion|pages=387\u201394|jstor=27896504}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the number of foreign-born residents stood at 6% of the population in 1991. Immigration subsequently surged and has not fallen since (as of 2018). Researches by the demographers and political scientists [[Eric Kaufmann]], [[Roger Eatwell]], and [[Matthew Goodwin]] suggest that such a fast ethno-demographic change is one of the key reasons behind public backlash in the form of nationalist populist revolts against the political establishment across the rich liberal democracies, an example of which being the Brexit Referendum in 2016.<ref name=\":202\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/11/03/two-new-books-explain-the-brexit-revolt|title=Two new books explain the Brexit revolt|last=|first=|date=November 3, 2018|work=The Economist|access-date=December 21, 2019|department=Britain}}</ref>\n\nItaly is a country where the problem of an aging population is especially acute. The fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having a lot of children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the Great Recession of 2007-8, with the youth unemployment rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad \u2013 150,000 did in 2018 \u2013 and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them. Only Japan has an age structure more tilted towards the elderly. One solution to this problem is incentivizing reproduction, as France has done, by investing in longer parental leaves, daycare, and tax exemptions for parents. As of 2019, France has approximately the same population as Italy but 65% more births. Another solution is immigration, which has been alleviating the decline, but it does not come without political backlash.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-italy-rising-anxiety-over-falling-birth-rates|title=In Italy, rising anxiety over falling birth rates|last=Livesay|first=Christopher|date=November 25, 2019|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGreece also suffers from a serious demographic problem as many young people are leaving the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere.

According to Statistics Canada, the number of households with both grandparents and grandchildren remained rare but has been growing. In 2011, five percent of Canadian children below the age of ten lived with a grandparent, up from 3.3% in the previous decade. This is in part because Canadian parents in early twenty-first century cannot (or think they cannot) afford childcare and often find themselves having to work long hours or irregular shifts. Meanwhile, many grandparents struggle to keep up with their highly active grandchildren on a regular basis due to their age. Between grandparents and parents, potential sources of friction include the diets of the children, their sleep schedule, how to discipline them, and how they may use electronic gadgets. Parents today are more reliant on the Internet for information than their own parents, and many even recommend that they take grandparenting classes.

The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite widespread concern over rising student debt, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008-9 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a government agency known as the [[National Board of Student Aid (Sweden)|Centrala Studiest\u00f6dsn\u00e4mnden]] (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the 2008-9 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995.

Known as the ''Service National Universel'' or SNU ([[:fr:Service national universel]]), it is a compulsory civic service. While students will not have to shave their heads or handle military equipment, they will have to sleep in tents, get up early (at 6:30 am), participate in various physical activities, raise the [[Flag of France|tricolor]], and sing the [[La Marseillaise|national anthem]]. They will have to wear a uniform, though it is more akin to the outfit of security guards rather than military personnel. This program takes a total of four weeks. In the first two, youths learn how to provide first aid, how navigating with a map, how to recognize fake news, emergency responses for various scenarios, and self-defense. In addition, they get health checks and get tested on their mastery of the French language, and they participate in debates on a variety of social issues, including environmentalism, state secularism, and gender equality. In the second fortnight, they volunteer with a charity for local government. The aim of this program is to promote national cohesion and patriotism, at a time of deep division on religious and political grounds, to get people out of their neighborhoods and regions, and mix people of different socioeconomic classes, something mandatory military service used to do. Supporters thought that teenagers rarely raise the national flag, spend too much time on their phones, and felt nostalgic for the era of compulsory military service, considered a rite of passage for young men and a tool of character-building. Critics argued that this program is inadequate, and would cost too much.<ref name=\":6\" /> The SNU is projected to affect some 800,000 French citizens each year when it becomes mandatory for all aged 16 to 21 by 2026, at a cost of some \u20ac1.6 billion.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20190711-france-civic-service-military-volunteer-french-values-macron-first-aid-national-cohesion|title=National civic service: A crash course in self-defence, emergency responses and French values|last=Villeminot|first=Florence|date=July 11, 2019|work=France 24|access-date=November 5, 2019|department=French Connection}}</ref> Another major concern is that it will overburden the French military, already stretched thin by counter-terrorism campaigns at home and abroad.<ref name=\":4\" /> A 2015 IFOP poll revealed that 80% of the French people supported some kind of mandatory service, military, or civilian.

Compared to the 2017-18 academic year, 2018-19 saw a drop of 1% in the number of foreign students.

Whereas in the past, Chinese firms copied the business strategies and models from their U.S. counterparts, now, they are developing their own approaches, and Southeast Asian companies are learning from their success and experience, a practice known as \"Copy from China.\" E-commerce has been flourishing. In Singapore, for example, not only is it now possible to place orders online, one may also purchase groceries in person, pay by mobile phone, and have them packed by machines; there are no cashiers. Whereas Westerners were first introduced to the Internet via their personal computers, people in China and Southeast Asia first got online with their mobile phones. Consequently, the e-commerce industry's heavy usage of mobile phone applications has paid off handsomely. In particular, Chinese entrepreneurs invest in what are known as \"super-apps,\" those that enable users to access all kinds of services within them, not just messaging, but also bike rentals and digital wallets. In Indonesia, relying on credit-card payments is difficult because the market penetration of this technology remains rather low (as of 2019).

However, the picture varies depending on the country. In Italy, environmentally friendly architecture is in high demand. Estonia and France are running short of legal professionals.

All member states except Finland need more ICT specialists, and all but Belgium, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and the United Kingdom need more teachers. The supply of STEM graduates has been insufficient because the dropout rate is high and because of an ongoing brain drain from some countries. Some countries need more teachers because many are retiring and need to be replaced. At the same time, Europe's aging population necessitates the expansion of the healthcare sector. Disincentives for (potential) workers in jobs in high demand include low social prestige, low salaries, and stressful work environments.

According to this \"hygiene hypothesis,\" such exposures give the infant's immune system some exercise, making it less likely to overreact. Evidence for this includes the fact that children living on a farm are consistently less likely to be allergic than their counterparts who are raised in the city, and that children born in a developed country to parents who immigrated from developing nations are more likely to be allergic than their parents are.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nA research article published in 2019 in the Lancet journal reported that the number of South Africans aged 15 to 19 being treated for HIV increased by a factor of ten between 2019 and 2010.

Researchers also asked over 600 non-Christian teenagers and almost 500 adults what their biggest barriers to faith were.

For example, in the cities of the Middle East, women who supported Sharia law had a 50% fertility advantage over those who opposed it the most at the turn of the century.<ref name=\":21\" /> According to the World Religious Database, the proportion of the human population identifying with a religion increased from 81% in 1970 to 85% in 2000 and is predicted to rise to 87% in 2025. In addition, the Catholic Church has gained 12% additional followers between 2000 and 2010, mainly from Asia and Africa.<ref name=\":21\" /> In 2018, Muslims had a median age of 23, Hindus 26, Christians 30, Buddhists and the religiously unaffiliated 34, and Jews 36. For comparison, the median age of the global population was 28 in 2018. Overall, Christians have a fertility rate of 2.6, and Muslims 2.9. Islam is the world's fastest growing religion.<ref name=\":14\" /> Meanwhile, the expansion of secularism will slow in Europe as the twenty-first century progresses.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\nBut religion can grow even in otherwise secular societies.<ref name=\":21\" /> For example, in Israel, the ultra-Orthodox Jews comprised just about five percent of the nation's primary schoolchildren in 1960, but by the start of the twenty-first century, one third of Jewish first graders in Israel came from this religious sect.<ref name=\":232\" /> Ultra-Orthodox Jewish women in Israel had on average 7.5 children compared to their more mainstream counterparts with just over two in the early 2000s.<ref name=\":21\" /> In Europe, immigration from the Middle East and Africa is an engine of religious growth. Children of immigrants tend to be about as religious as their parents and consider their religion to be a marker of their ethnic identity, thereby insulating themselves from the secularizing forces of the host society. The other engine is comparatively high fertility and religious endogamy. In France, a white Catholic woman had half a child more than her secular counterparts in the early 2000s; in Spain, that number was 0.77.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the Netherlands, the youngest villages belong to Orthodox Calvinists,<ref name=\":21\" /> who comprised 7% of the Dutch population by the early 2000s.<ref name=\":232\" /> In Austria, the number of people below the age of 15 who were Muslims rose past the 10%-mark in the first decade of the twenty-first century. In the United Kingdom, over 90% of Muslims married other Muslims by the turn of the millennium, and it is well-known that children born into an interfaith marriage tend to be less religious than their parents. Interfaith marriage is in fact a vehicle of secularization.<ref name=\":21\" /> Ultra-Orthodox Jews comprised just 12% of the British Jewish population but three quarters of Jewish births at the start of the twenty-first century. (This group is projected to make up the majority of Anglo-American Jews by 2050.)<ref name=\":232\" /> In the United States, Catholicism will become the largest religion by 2040 despite considerable losses to secularization and conversion to Protestantism thanks in no small part to the fact that Latino Catholics had a fertility rate of 2.83 compared to the national average of 2.03 in 2003. Such religious demographic changes will bring about social and political ramifications later in the century.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n== Risky behaviors ==\nGeneration Z is generally more risk-averse in certain activities than earlier generations. In 2013, 66% of American teenagers (older members of Generation Z) had tried alcohol, down from 82% in 1991 (younger Generation X).

The cartoons were presented as a series of static comic-strip panel images; generally the only movement involved the lips when a character spoke, the eyes, and the occasional arm or leg, or a fully animated black silhouette. The series used the original stories largely in their entirety, showcasing [[Jack Kirby]], [[Steve Ditko]] and [[Don Heck]] art, among others, from the period fans and historians call the [[Silver Age of comic books]].\n\n[[Stan Lee]], Marvel's editor and art director at the time, said in 2004 that he believed publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] negotiated the deal with Grantray-Lawrence and that Lawrence chose the characters to be used. Lawrence rented Lee and his wife a [[penthouse apartment]] at 30 East 60th Street, near [[Madison Avenue]], for Lee's use while he worked on the series.

Deathcore began in the early 2000s with early deathcore bands like [[Antagony]], [[Despised Icon]], and [[The Acacia Strain]] emerging at the time. The genre expanded in the mid\u2013late 2000s with the emergence of bands like [[Through the Eyes of the Dead]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Suicide Silence]], [[Carnifex (band)|Carnifex]], [[Job for a Cowboy]], [[Chelsea Grin]] and [[Whitechapel (band)|Whitechapel]]. In the mid\u2013late 2000s, deathcore became one of the most popular genres in heavy metal with the success of bands like Bring Me the Horizon, Suicide Silence, Job for a Cowboy, Whitechapel and Carnifex. In the 2010s, deathcore bands fusing deathcore with other genres also emerged. This included bands like [[Emmure]] and [[Attila (metalcore band)|Attila]] fusing deathcore with [[nu metal]] and bands like [[Veil of Maya]] and [[Born of Osiris]] fusing deathcore with [[progressive metal]] or [[djent]]. Deathcore received criticism from fans of heavy metal music, usually for its frequent use of breakdowns. Some deathcore musicians even rejected the deathcore label.\n\n==Characteristics==\nDeathcore combines death metal characteristics such as [[blast beat]]s, down-tuned guitars, [[tremolo picking]], and [[death growl|growled vocals]] with metalcore characteristics such as [[Break (music)#Heavy metal and punk rock|breakdowns]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The genre is usually defined by breakdowns and death metal riffs or metalcore riffs played in the usual death metal tuning.<ref name=\"Cosmo Lee\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=407731|title=chorus.fm|website=chorus.fm|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> Like in other [[extreme metal]] fusion genres, deathcore guitarists down-tune their [[electric guitar|guitars]] to give their music a heavier sound.

The State Government identified the Capital City area between Vijayawada and Guntur cities on the Southern bank of River Krishna upstream of Prakasam Barrage. The Amaravati Capital City has an area of 217.23 km<sup>2</sup> and is spread across 25 villages in 3 mandals (Thulluru, Mangalagiri and Tadepalli) of Guntur district. The 25 villages in the Capital City area have about 1 lakh population in about 27,000 households. The nearest cities are Vijayawada at a distance of 30 km and Guntur at a distance of 18 km. The nearest railway station is KC Canal railway station near Tadepalli and the nearest airport is Gannavaram which is at a distance of 22 km. The city is planned to spread over 217 km<sup>2</sup> area with a total cost of \u20b9 553.43 billions to the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) out of which state government contribution is only \u20b9 126 billion (equity \u20b9 66.29 billion and supporting grant \u20b9 59.71 billion) spread over a period of 8 years from April 2018 to March 2026 (\u20b9 5 billion in 2018\u201319, \u20b9 18 billion per year for later six years and \u20b9 13 billion in 2025\u201326).<ref name=\"amr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eenadu.net/eenadu-exclusive/newsarticle/general/1500/120008374|title=Amaravati city a self financed project |language=Telugu|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA)\n|'''City area details:'''\n|'''Land utilization'''\n|-\n|Roads, public utilities, parks, natural streams, water bodies\n|27,885 acres\n|-\n|Plots for residential area allotted to the Land contributors(Farmers)\n|11,826 acres\n|-\n|For the needs of other developments presently owned by the CRDA\n|14,037 acres\n|-\n|Total area under the jurisdiction of CRDA\n|53,748 acres\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Amaravati City Land Usage\n!Land use\n!Area (Sq.&nbsp;km)\n!'''%'''\n|-\n|Residential\n|60.77\n|27.9\n|-\n|Commercial\n|20.99\n|9.34\n|-\n|Public and Semi Public\n|11.49\n|5.29\n|-\n|Open spaces and Recreation\n|52.78\n|24.29\n|-\n|Industrial\n|12.26\n|5.64\n|-\n|Water Bodies\n|25.78\n|11.87\n|-\n|Traffic and Transportation\n|23.04\n|10.61\n|-\n|Cultural Heritage\n|0.15\n|0.07\n|-\n|Seed Capital\n|10.67\n|4.91\n|-\n|Total\n|217.23\n|100\n|}\nThe contribution from the government is to be repaid by the CRDA after the year 2037.

The State Government identified the Capital City area between Vijayawada and Guntur cities on the Southern bank of River Krishna upstream of Prakasam Barrage. The Amaravati Capital City has an area of 217.23 km<sup>2</sup> and is spread across 25 villages in 3 mandals (Thulluru, Mangalagiri and Tadepalli) of Guntur district.

A large part of Wrekenton consists of a [[council estate]], known as [[Springwell Estate]]. This is distinct from [[Springwell Village]], which is located a short distance across the border, within the [[City of Sunderland]].\n\n== History ==\nThe antiquarian [[John Hodgson (antiquary)|John Hodgson]] claimed to have named the village. He wrote, \"After the enclosure of the common (in 1822), Mr. Watson, of Warburton Place, Carrhill, founded a considerable village at this place, which, at my suggestion, he called Wrekenton.\" This name was chosen because Wrekenton and Eighton Banks were divided by the remains of the Wrekendyke Roman road. Wrekenton is believed to have been the meeting point of two Roman roads, [[Cade's Road]] and the Wrekendyke Road. Cade's Road ran from the [[Humber]] to [[Eboracum|York]] and [[Pons Aelius|Newcastle]], with the Wrekendyke Road branching away to the north east passing close to [[Jarrow]], and ending at the Roman fort and harbour of [[Arbeia]], at [[South Shields]]. It has even been conjectured that a Roman fort existed at the site now occupied by the Ravensworth Golf Club, but no evidence for this has been found.\n\nIn the 1860s, Wrekenton was still a very small village with about two hundred dwellings. It remained so for a further seventy years until [[slum clearance]] in Gateshead resulted in many new houses being built in Wrekenton, in order to accommodate the previous slum-dwellers. The main industries of the area surrounding the village during the nineteenth century were coal mining, quarrying, brickmaking and agriculture. The spelling of the town's name is recorded, in the mid 1890s, as \"Wreckenton\", which survived as the name of the local council ward serving the area until 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ukga.org/england/Durham/towns/Wreckenton.html|title=Wreckenton, Durham|last=|first=|date=|website=UK Genealogy Archives|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOld Durham Road was the main route between [[Durham, England|Durham]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] until 1827, when a new road was built to the west of it on lower ground and called Durham Road. Old Durham Road climbed the steep bank, known as Long Bank to Wrekenton and from there headed north to Beacon Lough before dropping down the steep bank into Gateshead. The mail coach used to pass along this road and one of the stopping places for the coach was ''The Coach and Horses'', an inn that still exists today. Other equally old public houses in Wrekenton, dating from the nineteenth century, are the ''The Seven Stars'' and ''The Ship''.\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the [[2011 United Kingdom census|2011 Census]], the ''High Fell'' [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|ward]] has a population of 6,110.<ref name=\":1\" /> 51.7% of the population are female, while 48.3% are male.

A large part of Wrekenton consists of a [[council estate]], known as [[Springwell Estate]]. This is distinct from [[Springwell Village]], which is located a short distance across the border, within the [[City of Sunderland]].\n\n== History ==\nThe antiquarian [[John Hodgson (antiquary)|John Hodgson]] claimed to have named the village. He wrote, \"After the enclosure of the common (in 1822), Mr. Watson, of Warburton Place, Carrhill, founded a considerable village at this place, which, at my suggestion, he called Wrekenton.\" This name was chosen because Wrekenton and Eighton Banks were divided by the remains of the Wrekendyke Roman road. Wrekenton is believed to have been the meeting point of two Roman roads, [[Cade's Road]] and the Wrekendyke Road. Cade's Road ran from the [[Humber]] to [[Eboracum|York]] and [[Pons Aelius|Newcastle]], with the Wrekendyke Road branching away to the north east passing close to [[Jarrow]], and ending at the Roman fort and harbour of [[Arbeia]], at [[South Shields]]. It has even been conjectured that a Roman fort existed at the site now occupied by the Ravensworth Golf Club, but no evidence for this has been found.\n\nIn the 1860s, Wrekenton was still a very small village with about two hundred dwellings. It remained so for a further seventy years until [[slum clearance]] in Gateshead resulted in many new houses being built in Wrekenton, in order to accommodate the previous slum-dwellers. The main industries of the area surrounding the village during the nineteenth century were coal mining, quarrying, brickmaking and agriculture. The spelling of the town's name is recorded, in the mid 1890s, as \"Wreckenton\", which survived as the name of the local council ward serving the area until 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ukga.org/england/Durham/towns/Wreckenton.html|title=Wreckenton, Durham|last=|first=|date=|website=UK Genealogy Archives|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOld Durham Road was the main route between [[Durham, England|Durham]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] until 1827, when a new road was built to the west of it on lower ground and called Durham Road. Old Durham Road climbed the steep bank, known as Long Bank to Wrekenton and from there headed north to Beacon Lough before dropping down the steep bank into Gateshead. The mail coach used to pass along this road and one of the stopping places for the coach was ''The Coach and Horses'', an inn that still exists today. Other equally old public houses in Wrekenton, dating from the nineteenth century, are the ''The Seven Stars'' and ''The Ship''.\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the [[2011 United Kingdom census|2011 Census]], the ''High Fell'' [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|ward]] has a population of 6,110.<ref name=\":1\" /> 51.7% of the population are female, while 48.3% are male.

In August 2008, Winkler was granted full custody of her three daughters.\n\n==Criminal case==\n[[Image:174 Mollie Dr Selmer TN.jpg|thumb|Former Winkler residence in [[Selmer, Tennessee]]]]\n\nAccording to police, Mary Winkler confessed to the March 22, 2006 fatal shooting of her husband, whose body was discovered in their home by church members after he missed that evening's service. He had been shot in the back with a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] shotgun.\n\nThe couple had been married since 1996. One neighborhood family reported that Matthew Winkler had repeatedly threatened to shoot that family's dog after it strayed onto the Winklers' lawn. Also, other people as well as Mary Winkler's family alleged that Matthew Winkler had been abusive to Mary.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=2667042&page=1 |title=ABC News: Preacher's Wife Killed Husband Because of Abuse, Family Says |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref> Winkler maintained this was the reason for the shooting.\n\nAfter police issued an [[Amber Alert]] due to fears of kidnapping, Mary Winkler and the children (Patricia, then 8; Mary Alice, then 6; Breanna, then 1) were discovered in [[Orange Beach, Alabama]]. Winkler was placed into custody there and later extradited to Tennessee to stand trial. When asked by investigators about what had happened to her husband, Winkler stated that she and her husband had argued about money and offered \"I guess that's when my ugly came out.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/04/18/winkler.testimony/index.html |title=Slain preacher's wife denies pulling trigger |publisher=Cnn.com |date=2007-04-18 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref> A grand jury indicted Winkler on June 12, 2006, accusing her of first-degree murder.\n\n===Bond hearing===\nOn June 30, 2006, Mary Winkler's bond hearing was held. A [[Tennessee Bureau of Investigation]] agent read a statement Winkler gave to authorities in Alabama, where she was arrested a day after her husband's body was found; in it, Winkler says she did not remember getting the gun but she did know her husband kept a shotgun in their home. The next thing she heard was a loud boom. Matthew Winkler was shot in the back as he lay in bed. He rolled from the bed onto the floor, and, still alive, he asked his wife, \"Why?\" to which she responded, \"I'm sorry.\" When she left the home, Matthew Winkler was still alive in the bedroom, and the phone had been disconnected from its socket. According to the statement, she and her husband had been arguing throughout the evening about many things, including family finances. She admitted some of the problems were \"her fault.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentappeal.com/html/winkler/bond2.html |title=Mary Winkler's bond hearing |publisher=Independentappeal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref>\n\nMary had lost money in what her lawyer said was a scam. She had deposited checks that came from \"unidentified sources\" in Canada and Nigeria into bank accounts belonging to her and her husband. The checks amounted to more than $17,000. Winkler had become caught up in a swindle known as the \"[[Advance-fee fraud|Nigerian scam]]\", which promises riches to victims who send money to cover the processing expenses. She added \"He had really been on me lately criticizing me for things \u2014 the way I walk, I eat, everything. It was just building up to a point. I was tired of it.

A plea for reduction of bond was filed and subsequently denied. Winkler's lawyers, Leslie Ballin and Steve Farese Sr., also filed motions to throw out her confession on a technicality, to require prosecutors to state whether or not they would seek the death penalty (they did not), to give potential jurors an extensive questionnaire, and other motions relating to [[voir dire]].\n\nWinkler's entire defense team (her attorneys Steve Farese Sr., Leslie Ballin, Tony Farese, Steve Farese, Jr. and Investigator Terry Cox) represented her pro bono throughout the criminal case.\n\n===Release from jail on bond===\nWinkler made bond on August 12, 2006 and was set for release from jail. Initially, problems stemming from a 1999 suspension of the bail bond company kept her in jail. However, Winkler was able to post $750,000 bond and was released on August 15, on the stipulation that she live with Rudolf and Kathy Thomsen, friends in [[McMinnville, Tennessee]]. The trial commenced on April 9, 2007, with the prosecution resting on April 16. The defense rested two days later.\n\n==Trial==\nOn April 18, 2007, Mary Winkler took the stand in her own defense. She told a jury of ten women and two men that her husband often \"berated\" her and forced her to wear \"slutty\" costumes for sex. As proof she displayed a pair of high-heeled shoes and a wig at which those in attendance gasped. Winkler claimed that she only shot her husband accidentally. She said that she went to the bedroom closet and retrieved a shotgun because she wanted to force him to work through their problems. \"I just wanted him to stop being so mean,\" she said through tears. Winkler denied she ever actually pulled the trigger, but told the jury \"something went off\". She heard a boom, then ran from the house because she thought he would be mad at her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/04/18/winkler.testimony/index.html |title=CNN report of trial testimony |publisher=Cnn.com |date=2007-04-18 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref>\n\n===Verdict===\nOn April 19, 2007, the jury came back with the verdict: guilty of [[voluntary manslaughter]]. Prosecutors had asked that Winkler be convicted of first-degree murder, but the jury settled on the lesser charge after deliberating for eight hours.\n\n===Sentencing===\nThe sentencing phase was set to begin on May 18, 2007, but was delayed due to a scheduling conflict by one of the attorneys.

In August 2008, Winkler was granted full custody of her three daughters.\n\n==Criminal case==\n[[Image:174 Mollie Dr Selmer TN.jpg|thumb|Former Winkler residence in [[Selmer, Tennessee]]]]\n\nAccording to police, Mary Winkler confessed to the March 22, 2006 fatal shooting of her husband, whose body was discovered in their home by church members after he missed that evening's service. He had been shot in the back with a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] shotgun.\n\nThe couple had been married since 1996. One neighborhood family reported that Matthew Winkler had repeatedly threatened to shoot that family's dog after it strayed onto the Winklers' lawn. Also, other people as well as Mary Winkler's family alleged that Matthew Winkler had been abusive to Mary.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=2667042&page=1 |title=ABC News: Preacher's Wife Killed Husband Because of Abuse, Family Says |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref> Winkler maintained this was the reason for the shooting.\n\nAfter police issued an [[Amber Alert]] due to fears of kidnapping, Mary Winkler and the children (Patricia, then 8; Mary Alice, then 6; Breanna, then 1) were discovered in [[Orange Beach, Alabama]]. Winkler was placed into custody there and later extradited to Tennessee to stand trial. When asked by investigators about what had happened to her husband, Winkler stated that she and her husband had argued about money and offered \"I guess that's when my ugly came out.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/04/18/winkler.testimony/index.html |title=Slain preacher's wife denies pulling trigger |publisher=Cnn.com |date=2007-04-18 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref> A grand jury indicted Winkler on June 12, 2006, accusing her of first-degree murder.\n\n===Bond hearing===\nOn June 30, 2006, Mary Winkler's bond hearing was held. A [[Tennessee Bureau of Investigation]] agent read a statement Winkler gave to authorities in Alabama, where she was arrested a day after her husband's body was found; in it, Winkler says she did not remember getting the gun but she did know her husband kept a shotgun in their home. The next thing she heard was a loud boom. Matthew Winkler was shot in the back as he lay in bed. He rolled from the bed onto the floor, and, still alive, he asked his wife, \"Why?\" to which she responded, \"I'm sorry.\" When she left the home, Matthew Winkler was still alive in the bedroom, and the phone had been disconnected from its socket. According to the statement, she and her husband had been arguing throughout the evening about many things, including family finances. She admitted some of the problems were \"her fault.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentappeal.com/html/winkler/bond2.html |title=Mary Winkler's bond hearing |publisher=Independentappeal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref>\n\nMary had lost money in what her lawyer said was a scam. She had deposited checks that came from \"unidentified sources\" in Canada and Nigeria into bank accounts belonging to her and her husband. The checks amounted to more than $17,000. Winkler had become caught up in a swindle known as the \"[[Advance-fee fraud|Nigerian scam]]\", which promises riches to victims who send money to cover the processing expenses. She added \"He had really been on me lately criticizing me for things \u2014 the way I walk, I eat, everything. It was just building up to a point. I was tired of it. I guess I got to a point and snapped.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=20060701&id=OmpPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dQQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5613,21788|title=Wife of Pastor Details Dispute Before Slaying|date=2006-07-01|publisher=Toledo Blade|accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nBond was later set at $750,000, an amount that defense lawyer Steve Farese Sr. claimed was excessive and \"tantamount to no bond at all\". A plea for reduction of bond was filed and subsequently denied. Winkler's lawyers, Leslie Ballin and Steve Farese Sr., also filed motions to throw out her confession on a technicality, to require prosecutors to state whether or not they would seek the death penalty (they did not), to give potential jurors an extensive questionnaire, and other motions relating to [[voir dire]].\n\nWinkler's entire defense team (her attorneys Steve Farese Sr., Leslie Ballin, Tony Farese, Steve Farese, Jr. and Investigator Terry Cox) represented her pro bono throughout the criminal case.\n\n===Release from jail on bond===\nWinkler made bond on August 12, 2006 and was set for release from jail. Initially, problems stemming from a 1999 suspension of the bail bond company kept her in jail. However, Winkler was able to post $750,000 bond and was released on August 15, on the stipulation that she live with Rudolf and Kathy Thomsen, friends in [[McMinnville, Tennessee]]. The trial commenced on April 9, 2007, with the prosecution resting on April 16. The defense rested two days later.\n\n==Trial==\nOn April 18, 2007, Mary Winkler took the stand in her own defense. She told a jury of ten women and two men that her husband often \"berated\" her and forced her to wear \"slutty\" costumes for sex. As proof she displayed a pair of high-heeled shoes and a wig to which those in attendance gasped. Winkler claimed that she only shot her husband accidentally. She said that she went to the bedroom closet and retrieved a shotgun because she wanted to force him to work through their problems. \"I just wanted him to stop being so mean,\" she said through tears. Winkler denied she ever actually pulled the trigger, but told the jury \"something went off\". She heard a boom, then ran from the house because she thought he would be mad at her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/04/18/winkler.testimony/index.html |title=CNN report of trial testimony |publisher=Cnn.com |date=2007-04-18 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref>\n\n===Verdict===\nOn April 19, 2007, the jury came back with the verdict: guilty of [[voluntary manslaughter]]. Prosecutors had asked that Winkler be convicted of first-degree murder, but the jury settled on the lesser charge after deliberating for eight hours.\n\n===Sentencing===\nThe sentencing phase was set to begin on May 18, 2007, but was delayed due to a scheduling conflict by one of the attorneys.

The King of Jerusalem was bound to reconcile them in case of disputes, or between a vassal Prince and the [[Latin Patriarich of Antioch]], and could claim the regency in case of a vacancy or minority in their successions.\n\nEdessa was perhaps the most closely tied to the Kingdom, despite its distance. Its first two Counts became kings of Jerusalem, and the county was bestowed as a royal gift on [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin I]].\n\nThe County of Tripoli, the nearest of them, is sometimes considered to have been a vassal lordship under the king's suzerainty, although it preserved an extraordinary degree of sovereignty.\n\nAntioch was almost independent, for it was founded already before the kingship and its first holder was a rival of kings, the original leader of the crusade. Later in its history, it would at times recognize Byzantine or Armenian suzerainty, or none at all.\n\nThese states dated their documents by the reigns of their own rulers, carried out their own foreign policy, and sent military aid to the Kingdom of their own will, rather than through feudal obligation; therefore, they are generally recognized as sovereign and are treated more fully under their own articles.\n\n== Inheritance in the Kingdom of Jerusalem ==\nLordships in the Kingdom of Jerusalem were usually hereditary, in principle, but in practice the circumstances were such that their holders did not form long uninterrupted lines of inheritance, which was contrary to the usual patterns of succession in Europe.\n\nFirstly, in the early years of the kingdom, lords sought out their own territories, and lordships changed hands often. Secondly, the average lifespan of male lords in Palestine was rather low, due to the constant state of warfare and violence, which led to inheritances by females and/or extinction of whole families.\n\nSuccession from father to son happened more rarely than in more peaceful countries in Europe. Female succession opened up the option for the liege or the monarch to reward services, loyalty and capability, as well as achievements, by giving an heiress' hand in marriage and her inherited lordship to a \"new man\".\n\nA typical succession pattern was a father followed by a daughter, sister, or niece, who was then married to a man worthy of some reward, who then himself succeeded to the territory. This made the succession unpredictable and caused the family holding a particular territory to change once or perhaps even more often in a generation.\n\nSometimes families became extinct, or escaped from Syria, and either a distant relative came to claim their land, or more usually, their liege gave the lordship to another family. Sometimes a lord was condemned for treason, rebellion or some other reason, and he and possibly his descendants were disinherited from the lordship.\n\nOccasionally, vacant lordships were put into the ''royal domain'', but more often, another person received the lordship. A less careful observer may think that they were not hereditary, but almost always their succession took place according to feudal rights of inheritance, utilizing the relatively high number of heiresses.\n\nMany of these seigneuries ceased to exist after the loss of Jerusalem in 1187, and the rest of them after the fall of Acre in 1291, yet they often had Cypriot or European claimants for decades or centuries afterwards; these claimants, of course, held no actual territory in Syria after the mainland kingdom was lost.\n\n== County of Jaffa and Ascalon ==\n{{main|County of Jaffa and Ascalon}}\n\nJaffa, on the Mediterranean coast, was fortified after the First Crusade, and was a separate county until the revolt of [[Hugh II of Le Puiset]] in 1134. Afterwards, it was usually held directly by the royal family or one of their relatives. After 1153 it was the double County of Jaffa and Ascalon, when the Egyptian fortress of Ascalon was conquered. It passed in and out of direct royal control, and became titular after the fall of [[Akko|Acre]] in 1291. A number of seigneuries were vassals to the Count of Jaffa:\n\n=== Lordship of Ramla ===\n{{main|Lordship of Ramla}}\n\nOriginally held by the Bishop of Ramla-Lydda, in 1126 Ramla became part of Jaffa, and a separate lordship was created after Hugh II's revolt in 1134. The [[Ibelin (castle)|castle of Ibelin]] happened to be located quite near Ramla. It was later a part of the [[Lordship of Ibelin|Ibelin possessions]], inherited from [[Helvis of Ramla]], daughter of [[Baldwin I of Ramla|Baldwin of Ramla]] and wife of [[Barisan of Ibelin]].\n\n=== Lordship of Ibelin ===\n{{main|House of Ibelin}}\n\nThe Lordship of [[Ibelin (castle)|Ibelin]] was also created out of Jaffa (in the 1140s, or perhaps as early as 1134 after Hugh II's revolt). The lordship was given as a reward to Barisan of Ibelin, whose wife [[Helvis of Ramla]] already owned lands in the vicinity. The castle of [[Ramla]], the family's other inheritance, was nearby, and together these territories formed a wealthy entity. Lord [[Balian of Ibelin]] married [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], widow of King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]], and the Ibelins became the most powerful noble family of the kingdom, later ruling also over [[Beirut]].\n\n=== Lordship of Mirabel ===\n[[Mirabel (castle)|Mirabel]] was separated from Jaffa after the revolt in 1134, and also given to Barisan of Ibelin, although it was separate from Ibelin.\n\n== Principality of Galilee ==\n{{main|Principality of Galilee}}\n\nThe Principality of [[Galilee]] was established by [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] in 1099. The principality became the fief of the families of St. Omer, Montfaucon (Falcomberques), and then Bures, and its main seat was in [[Tiberias]]; thus it was sometimes also called the Principality of Tiberias or the Tiberiad. The Principality was destroyed by [[Saladin]] in 1187, although the title was used by relatives and younger sons of the kings of Cyprus (the titular kings of Jerusalem) afterwards.\n\nThe Principality also had its own vassals, the Lordships of [[Lordship of Beirut|Beirut]], [[Lordship of Nazareth|Nazareth]] and [[Lordship of Haifa|Haifa]], which often had their own sub-vassals.\n\n=== Lordship of Beirut ===\nBeirut was captured in 1110 and given to [[Fulk of Gu\u00eenes]]. It was one of the longest-lived seigneuries, surviving until the final collapse of the kingdom in 1291, although only as a tiny strip on the Mediterranean coast surrounding Beirut. It was important for trade with Europe, and had its own vassals within the Principality of Galilee.\n\nThe Lords of Beirut were :\n\n*[[Foulques de Guines|Fulk of Gu\u00eenes]], 1110\u20131125\n*[[Walter I of Brisebarre]], 1125\u20131138\n*[[Guy I of Brisebarre]], 1138\u20131156\n*[[Walter II of Brisebarre]], 1156\u20131179\n*[[Walter III of Brisebarre]], 1179\u20131187\n*[[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John I of Ibelin]], 1204\u20131236\n*[[Balian of Beirut|Balian of Ibelin]], 1236\u20131247\n*[[Hugh of Ibelin]], 1247\u20131254\n*[[John II of Beirut|John II of Ibelin]], 1254\u20131264\n*[[Isabella of Ibelin (1252\u20131282)|Isabella of Ibelin]], 1264\u20131282\n**1265\u20131267, [[Hugh II of Cyprus]]\n**1272\u20131273, [[Haymo L\u00e9trange]]\n**1276\u20131277, [[Nicolas l'Alleman]]\n**1278\u20131282, [[Guillaume Berlais]]\n*[[Eschive d'Ibelin (1253\u20131312)|Eschive d'Ibelin]], 1282\u20131291\n**1282\u20131284, [[Humphrey of Montfort (died 1284)|Humphrey of Montfort]]\n**1291, [[Guy of Cyprus (died 1302)|Guy of Cyprus]] (died 1302)\n\nThe sub-vassals of Beirut were:\n\n==== Lordship of Banias ====\n[[Banias]] ([[Caesarea Philippi]]) was given to [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] by the [[Hashshashin|Assassins]] in 1128. Banias was merged with [[Toron]] under [[Humphrey II of Toron]] until it fell to [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] in 1164, and when it was recovered it became part of the Seigneury of Joscelin III of Edessa (see below).\n\n==== Lordship of Toron ====\n{{main|Toron}}\n\nThe castle of [[Toron]] was built by Hugh of St. Omer to help capture [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], and was given to [[Humphrey I of Toron|Humphrey I]] in 1107. The lords of Toron tended to be very influential in the kingdom; Humphrey II was constable of Jerusalem, as was Humphrey III. Humphrey IV was married to [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]], Amalric I's daughter. Toron was later merged with the royal domain of Tyre.\n\nToron had two vassals of its own, the Lordship of Castel Neuf, which fell to Nur ad-Din in 1167, and the Lordship of Toron Ahmud, which was sold to the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1261.\n\n=== Lordship of Nazareth ===\n[[Nazareth]] was the original site of the Latin Patriarch, established by Tancred. It was created as a [[Seigneurialism|seigneury]] in Galilee in 1115.\n\n=== Lordship of Haifa ===\n[[Haifa]] was partly an ecclesiastical domain ruled by the [[Archbishop of Nazareth]], and partly created from other lands in the Principality of Galilee.\n\n* [[Geldemar Carpenel]] (1100-1101)\n* [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] (1101 \u2013 1103)\n* Rorgius (1103\u20131107)\n* Pagan (1107\u20131112)\n* ''royal domain (1112\u20131190'')\n* Vivian (c. 1140s)\n* Pagan (1190\u2013?)\n* Rorgius II (?\u20131244?)\n* Garsias Alvarez (c. 1250)\n* Gilles d'Estrain (c. 1260)\n* Miles ?\n* Geoffrey\n* Gilles II\n* John of Valenciennes (c. 1310)\n\n== Lordship of Sidon ==\n{{main|Lordship of Sidon}}\n\n[[Sidon]] was captured in 1110 and given to [[Eustace Grenier|Eustace I Grenier]].\n\n=== Lordship of Caesarea ===\n[[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] was captured in 1101 and given to the [[Archbishop of Caesarea]].

It was centred on the Cave of Tyron. Julian of Sidon sold it to the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1256.\n\n== Lordship of Oultrejordain==\n{{main|Oultrejordain}}\n\nThe Lordship of Oultrejordain, consisting of land with an undefined boundary to the east of the [[Jordan River]], was one of the largest and most important seigneuries. It was an important source of revenue, from the Muslim caravan routes that existed there. The last lord, [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]], received Oultrejordain by marrying its heiress, [[Stephanie of Milly, Lady of Oultrejordain|Stephanie of Milly]]. Raynald considered himself Prince of Oultrejordain, not subject to the King, and was especially hostile to the Muslims. He was largely responsible as the pretence for [[Saladin]]'s invasion of the kingdom in 1187. Saladin conquered much of the area in 1187 and personally executed Raynald at the [[Battle of Hattin]].\n\n== Other seigneuries ==\n(''Titular lords/princes are italicized'')\n\n===Principality of Bethlehem===\n* ''Balian of Ibelin'' (died 1315/1316 in [[Kerynia]], soon before April 19, 1316), also Titular [[Prince of Galilee]]\n\n=== Lordship of Adelon ===\nThis lordship seems to have been created after the centre of the kingdom was moved to Acre, and held some influence under [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\n*Adam\n*Agnes (c. 1200)\n*[[Daniel I of Adelon|Daniel of Terremonde]]\n*Daniel II of Terremonde\n*Peter (c. 1250)\n*Jordan\n\n=== Lordship of Arsuf ===\n[[Arsuf]], located north of Jaffa, (called Arsur by the Crusaders) was captured in 1101 but remained a royal domain until around 1163 when John of Arsuf became lord.\n*John of Arsuf (1163\u2013?)\n*[[Thierry d'Orca|Thierry of Orguenes]] (c. 1190s)\n*[[Melisende of Arsur|Melisende]] with [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin]] (also lord of Beirut) (?\u20131236)\n*[[John of Arsuf|John of Ibelin]] (1236\u20131258)\n*[[Balian of Arsuf|Balian of Ibelin]] (1258\u20131261, titular 1261\u20131277)\n*''John of Ibelin'' (1277\u20131309)\n*''Balian of Ibelin'' (1309\u20131333)\n*''Philip of Ibelin'' (1333\u20131373)\n\n=== Lordship of Bethsan ===\n[[Bethsan]] was occupied by Tancred in 1099; it was never part of Galilee, despite its location, but became a royal domain in 1101, probably until around 1120.

[[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], always an important town, had been part of the royal domain, and after Conrad, it also belonged to the kings personally. After the kingdom moved to Acre, coronations took place in Tyre. Sometime after 1246, Tyre was conferred upon [[Philip of Montfort, Lord of Tyre|Philip of Montfort]] by [[Henry I of Cyprus]] (then Regent of Jerusalem) for his support of the Ibelin (baronial) party against the Imperialists. The grant was confirmed c. 1269 by [[Hugh III of Cyprus]], with a clause allowing Hugh to buy back the lordship. This was exercised in 1284, when the city was given to his sister [[Margaret of Antioch-Lusignan|Margaret]], already the Dowager Lady of Tyre.\n\n===Lordship of Joscelin III of Edessa ===\nThis lordship, often called the ''seigneurie de Joscelin'', was an unusual creation given to [[Joscelin III of Edessa|Joscelin III]], the nominal [[County of Edessa|Count of Edessa]], which had been lost long before. It was created around 1176 when Joscelin married Agnes of Milly, and was formed from royal land around Acre. Joscelin had only daughters, who married into the families of von Henneberg and Mandelee. The heirs sold in 1220 the seigneury{{dubious|Lordship yes, seigneurie no.

The King of Jerusalem was bound to reconcile them in case of disputes, or between a vassal Prince and the [[Latin Patriarich of Antioch]], and could claim the regency in case of a vacancy or minority in their successions.\n\nEdessa was perhaps the most closely tied to the Kingdom, despite its distance. Its first two Counts became kings of Jerusalem, and the county was bestowed as a royal gift on [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin I]].\n\nThe County of Tripoli, the nearest of them, is sometimes considered to have been a vassal lordship under the king's suzerainty, although it preserved an extraordinary degree of sovereignty.\n\nAntioch was almost independent, for it was founded already before the kingship and its first holder was a rival of kings, the original leader of the crusade. Later in its history, it would at times recognize Byzantine or Armenian suzerainty, or none at all.\n\nThese states dated their documents by the reigns of their own rulers, carried out their own foreign policy, and sent military aid to the Kingdom of their own will, rather than through feudal obligation; therefore, they are generally recognized as sovereign and are treated more fully under their own articles.\n\n== Inheritance in the Kingdom of Jerusalem ==\nLordships in the Kingdom of Jerusalem were usually hereditary, in principle, but in practice the circumstances were such that their holders did not form long uninterrupted lines of inheritance, which was contrary to the usual patterns of succession in Europe.\n\nFirstly, in the early years of the kingdom, lords sought out their own territories, and lordships changed hands often. Secondly, the average lifespan of male lords in Palestine was rather low, due to the constant state of warfare and violence, which led to inheritances by females and/or extinction of whole families.\n\nSuccession from father to son happened more rarely than in more peaceful countries in Europe. Female succession opened up the option for the liege or the monarch to reward services, loyalty and capability, as well as achievements, by giving an heiress' hand in marriage and her inherited lordship to a \"new man\".\n\nA typical succession pattern was a father followed by a daughter, sister, or niece, who was then married to a man worthy of some reward, who then himself succeeded to the territory. This made the succession unpredictable and caused the family holding a particular territory to change once or perhaps even more often in a generation.\n\nSometimes families became extinct, or escaped from Syria, and either a distant relative came to claim their land, or more usually, their liege gave the lordship to another family. Sometimes a lord was condemned for treason, rebellion or some other reason, and he and possibly his descendants were disinherited from the lordship.\n\nOccasionally, vacant lordships were put into the ''royal domain'', but more often, another person received the lordship. A less careful observer may think that they were not hereditary, but almost always their succession took place according to feudal rights of inheritance, utilizing the relatively high number of heiresses.\n\nMany of these seigneuries ceased to exist after the loss of Jerusalem in 1187, and the rest of them after the fall of Acre in 1291, yet they often had Cypriot or European claimants for decades or centuries afterwards; these claimants, of course, held no actual territory in Syria after the mainland kingdom was lost.\n\n== County of Jaffa and Ascalon ==\n{{main|County of Jaffa and Ascalon}}\n\nJaffa, on the Mediterranean coast, was fortified after the First Crusade, and was a separate county until the revolt of [[Hugh II of Le Puiset]] in 1134. Afterwards, it was usually held directly by the royal family or one of their relatives. After 1153 it was the double County of Jaffa and Ascalon, when the Egyptian fortress of Ascalon was conquered. It passed in and out of direct royal control, and became titular after the fall of [[Akko|Acre]] in 1291. A number of seigneuries were vassals to the Count of Jaffa:\n\n=== Lordship of Ramla ===\n{{main|Lordship of Ramla}}\n\nOriginally held by the Bishop of Ramla-Lydda, in 1126 Ramla became part of Jaffa, and a separate lordship was created after Hugh II's revolt in 1134. The [[Ibelin (castle)|castle of Ibelin]] happened to be located quite near Ramla. It was later a part of the [[Lordship of Ibelin|Ibelin possessions]], inherited from [[Helvis of Ramla]], daughter of [[Baldwin I of Ramla|Baldwin of Ramla]] and wife of [[Barisan of Ibelin]].\n\n=== Lordship of Ibelin ===\n{{main|House of Ibelin}}\n\nThe Lordship of [[Ibelin (castle)|Ibelin]] was also created out of Jaffa (in the 1140s, or perhaps as early as 1134 after Hugh II's revolt). The lordship was given as a reward to Barisan of Ibelin, whose wife [[Helvis of Ramla]] already owned lands in the vicinity. The castle of [[Ramla]], the family's other inheritance, was nearby, and together these territories formed a wealthy entity. Lord [[Balian of Ibelin]] married [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], widow of King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]], and the Ibelins became the most powerful noble family of the kingdom, later ruling also over [[Beirut]].\n\n=== Lordship of Mirabel ===\n[[Mirabel (castle)|Mirabel]] was separated from Jaffa after the revolt in 1134, and also given to Barisan of Ibelin, although it was separate from Ibelin.\n\n== Principality of Galilee ==\n{{main|Principality of Galilee}}\n\nThe Principality of [[Galilee]] was established by [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] in 1099. The principality became the fief of the families of St. Omer, Montfaucon (Falcomberques), and then Bures, and its main seat was in [[Tiberias]]; thus it was sometimes also called the Principality of Tiberias or the Tiberiad. The Principality was destroyed by [[Saladin]] in 1187, although the title was used by relatives and younger sons of the kings of Cyprus (the titular kings of Jerusalem) afterwards.\n\nThe Principality also had its own vassals, the Lordships of [[Lordship of Beirut|Beirut]], [[Lordship of Nazareth|Nazareth]] and [[Lordship of Haifa|Haifa]], which often had their own sub-vassals.\n\n=== Lordship of Beirut ===\nBeirut was captured in 1110 and given to [[Fulk of Gu\u00eenes]]. It was one of the longest-lived seigneuries, surviving until the final collapse of the kingdom in 1291, although only as a tiny strip on the Mediterranean coast surrounding Beirut. It was important for trade with Europe, and had its own vassals within the Principality of Galilee.\n\nThe Lords of Beirut were :\n\n*[[Foulques de Guines]], 1110\u20131125\n*[[Walter I of Brisebarre]], 1125\u20131138\n*[[Guy I of Brisebarre]], 1138\u20131156\n*[[Walter II of Brisebarre]], 1156\u20131179\n*[[Walter III of Brisebarre]], 1179\u20131187\n*[[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John I of Ibelin]], 1204\u20131236\n*[[Balian of Beirut|Balian of Ibelin]], 1236\u20131247\n*[[Hugh of Ibelin]], 1247\u20131254\n*[[John II of Beirut|John II of Ibelin]], 1254\u20131264\n*[[Isabella of Ibelin (1252\u20131282)|Isabella of Ibelin]], 1264\u20131282\n**1265\u20131267, [[Hugh II of Cyprus]]\n**1272\u20131273, [[Haymo L\u00e9trange]]\n**1276\u20131277, [[Nicolas l'Alleman]]\n**1278\u20131282, [[Guillaume Berlais]]\n*[[Eschive d'Ibelin (1253\u20131312)|Eschive d'Ibelin]], 1282\u20131291\n**1282\u20131284, [[Humphrey of Montfort (died 1284)|Humphrey of Montfort]]\n**1291, [[Guy of Cyprus (died 1302)|Guy of Cyprus]] (died 1302)\n\nThe sub-vassals of Beirut were:\n\n==== Lordship of Banias ====\n[[Banias]] ([[Caesarea Philippi]]) was given to [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] by the [[Hashshashin|Assassins]] in 1128. Banias was merged with [[Toron]] under [[Humphrey II of Toron]] until it fell to [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] in 1164, and when it was recovered it became part of the Seigneury of Joscelin III of Edessa (see below).\n\n==== Lordship of Toron ====\n{{main|Toron}}\n\nThe castle of [[Toron]] was built by Hugh of St. Omer to help capture [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], and was given to [[Humphrey I of Toron|Humphrey I]] in 1107. The lords of Toron tended to be very influential in the kingdom; Humphrey II was constable of Jerusalem, as was Humphrey III. Humphrey IV was married to [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]], Amalric I's daughter. Toron was later merged with the royal domain of Tyre.\n\nToron had two vassals of its own, the Lordship of Castel Neuf, which fell to Nur ad-Din in 1167, and the Lordship of Toron Ahmud, which was sold to the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1261.\n\n=== Lordship of Nazareth ===\n[[Nazareth]] was the original site of the Latin Patriarch, established by Tancred. It was created as a [[Seigneurialism|seigneury]] in Galilee in 1115.\n\n=== Lordship of Haifa ===\n[[Haifa]] was partly an ecclesiastical domain ruled by the [[Archbishop of Nazareth]], and partly created from other lands in the Principality of Galilee.\n\n* [[Geldemar Carpenel]] (1100-1101)\n* [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] (1101 \u2013 1103)\n* Rorgius (1103\u20131107)\n* Pagan (1107\u20131112)\n* ''royal domain (1112\u20131190'')\n* Vivian (c. 1140s)\n* Pagan (1190\u2013?)\n* Rorgius II (?\u20131244?)\n* Garsias Alvarez (c. 1250)\n* Gilles d'Estrain (c. 1260)\n* Miles ?\n* Geoffrey\n* Gilles II\n* John of Valenciennes (c. 1310)\n\n== Lordship of Sidon ==\n{{main|Lordship of Sidon}}\n\n[[Sidon]] was captured in 1110 and given to [[Eustace Grenier|Eustace I Grenier]].\n\n=== Lordship of Caesarea ===\n[[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] was captured in 1101 and given to the [[Archbishop of Caesarea]].

It was centred on the Cave of Tyron. Julian of Sidon sold it to the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1256.\n\n== Lordship of Oultrejordain==\n{{main|Oultrejordain}}\n\nThe Lordship of Oultrejordain, consisting of land with an undefined boundary to the east of the [[Jordan River]], was one of the largest and most important seigneuries. It was an important source of revenue, from the Muslim caravan routes that existed there. The last lord, [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]], received Oultrejordain by marrying its heiress, [[Stephanie of Milly, Lady of Oultrejordain|Stephanie of Milly]]. Raynald considered himself Prince of Oultrejordain, not subject to the King, and was especially hostile to the Muslims. He was largely responsible as the pretence for [[Saladin]]'s invasion of the kingdom in 1187. Saladin conquered much of the area in 1187 and personally executed Raynald at the [[Battle of Hattin]].\n\n== Other seigneuries ==\n(''Titular lords/princes are italicized'')\n\n===Principality of Bethlehem===\n* ''Balian of Ibelin'' (died 1315/1316 in [[Kerynia]], soon before April 19, 1316), also Titular [[Prince of Galilee]]\n\n=== Lordship of Adelon ===\nThis lordship seems to have been created after the centre of the kingdom was moved to Acre, and held some influence under [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\n*Adam\n*Agnes (c. 1200)\n*[[Daniel I of Adelon|Daniel of Terremonde]]\n*Daniel II of Terremonde\n*Peter (c. 1250)\n*Jordan\n\n=== Lordship of Arsuf ===\n[[Arsuf]], located north of Jaffa, (called Arsur by the Crusaders) was captured in 1101 but remained a royal domain until around 1163 when John of Arsuf became lord.\n*John of Arsuf (1163\u2013?)\n*[[Thierry d'Orca|Thierry of Orguenes]] (c. 1190s)\n*[[Melisende of Arsur|Melisende]] with [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin]] (also lord of Beirut) (?\u20131236)\n*[[John of Arsuf|John of Ibelin]] (1236\u20131258)\n*[[Balian of Arsuf|Balian of Ibelin]] (1258\u20131261, titular 1261\u20131277)\n*''John of Ibelin'' (1277\u20131309)\n*''Balian of Ibelin'' (1309\u20131333)\n*''Philip of Ibelin'' (1333\u20131373)\n\n=== Lordship of Bethsan ===\n[[Bethsan]] was occupied by Tancred in 1099; it was never part of Galilee, despite its location, but became a royal domain in 1101, probably until around 1120.

[[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], always an important town, had been part of the royal domain, and after Conrad, it also belonged to the kings personally. After the kingdom moved to Acre, coronations took place in Tyre. Sometime after 1246, Tyre was conferred upon [[Philip of Montfort, Lord of Tyre|Philip of Montfort]] by [[Henry I of Cyprus]] (then Regent of Jerusalem) for his support of the Ibelin (baronial) party against the Imperialists. The grant was confirmed c. 1269 by [[Hugh III of Cyprus]], with a clause allowing Hugh to buy back the lordship. This was exercised in 1284, when the city was given to his sister [[Margaret of Antioch-Lusignan|Margaret]], already the Dowager Lady of Tyre.\n\n===Lordship of Joscelin III of Edessa ===\nThis lordship, often called the ''seigneurie de Joscelin'', was an unusual creation given to [[Joscelin III of Edessa|Joscelin III]], the nominal [[County of Edessa|Count of Edessa]], which had been lost long before. It was created around 1176 when Joscelin married Agnes of Milly, and was formed from royal land around Acre. Joscelin had only daughters, who married into the families of von Henneberg and Mandelee.

Pepe the Frog is an [[Internet meme]] which has been appropriated by the alt-right as a symbol of the movement.</ref>).]]\n\nThe '''alt-right''', an abbreviation of '''alternative right''', is a loosely connected [[Far-right politics|far-right]], [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] movement based in the United States. A largely [[Internet activism|online phenomenon]], the alt-right originated in the U.S. during the 2010s, although it has since established a presence in various other countries. The term is ill-defined, having been used in different ways by various self-described \"alt-rightists\", media commentators, and academics. Groups which have been identified as alt-right also espouse [[white supremacism]], [[white separatism]], [[anti-immigration|severe immigration restrictions]], and [[antisemitism]].\n\nIn 2010, the American white nationalist [[Richard B. Spencer]] launched ''The Alternative Right'' [[webzine]]. Spencer's \"alternative right\" was influenced by earlier forms of American white nationalism, as well as [[paleoconservatism]], the [[Dark Enlightenment]], and the [[Nouvelle Droite]]. His term was shortened to \"alt-right\" and popularised by far-right participants of [[/pol/]], the politics board of web forum [[4chan]]. It came to be associated with other white nationalist websites and groups, including Andrew Anglin's ''[[Daily Stormer]]'', Brad Griffin's ''Occidental Dissent'', and Matthew Heimbach's [[Traditionalist Worker Party]]. Following the 2014 [[Gamergate controversy]], the alt-right made increasing use of [[trolling]] and [[online harassment]] to raise its profile. In 2015, it attracted broader attention\u2014particularly through coverage on [[Steve Bannon]]'s [[Breitbart News]]\u2014due to alt-right support for [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]]. On [[2016 United States presidential election|being elected]], Trump renounced the movement. Attempting to move from a web-based to a street-based movement, Spencer and other alt-rightists organised the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], Virginia, which faced significant [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] opposition. After this, the movement began to decline.\n\nThe alt-right is a [[Scientific racism|biologically racist]] movement promoting a form of far-right [[identity politics]] for [[European Americans]]. Part of its membership supports [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrationist]] policies to ensure a continued white majority in the United States. Others call for the breakup of the country to form a [[white separatism|white separatist]] [[ethno-state]] in [[North America]]. Some alt-rightists seek to make white nationalism socially respectable in the U.S., while others\u2014known as the \"[[Fourteen Words|1488]]\" scene\u2014adopt openly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] stances. Some alt-rightists are [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]], promoting a [[conspiracy theory]] that there is [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|a Jewish plot]] to bring about [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]]; other alt-rightists view most Jews as members of the white race. The alt-right is [[anti-feminism|anti-feminist]], advocates for a more [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], and intersects with the [[men's rights movement]] and other sectors of the online [[manosphere]]. Alt-rightists generally support [[Anti-interventionism|anti-interventionist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]] [[Foreign policy|foreign policies]] alongside [[Protectionism|economic protectionism]]. Individuals aligned with many of the alt-right's ideas but not its white nationalism have been termed \"[[alt-lite]]\".\n\nThe alt-right distinguished itself from earlier forms of white nationalism through its largely online presence and its heavy use of irony and humor, particularly through the promotion of [[Internet memes]] like [[Pepe the Frog]]. Membership was overwhelmingly white and male, with academic and anti-fascist observers linking its growth to deteriorating living standards and prospects, anxieties about the place of white masculinity, and anger at increasingly visible [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] movements such as [[Black Lives Matter]]. Groups using the \"alt-right\" label have been characterised as [[hate group]]s,<ref name=\"ADL\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/alt-right-a-primer-about-the-new-white-supremacy |title=Alt Right: A Primer about the New White Supremacy |website=Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/alt-right |title=Alt-Right |work=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref> while alt-right material has contributed to the radicalization of white men responsible for various far-right murders and [[Right-wing terrorism|terrorist]] attacks in the U.S. since 2014.<ref name=\"SPLC\">{{cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20180205/alt-right-killing-people|title=The Alt-Right is Killing People|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-report-white-supremacist-murders-more-than-doubled-in-2017/ |title=ADL Report: White Supremacist Murders More Than Doubled in 2017 |accessdate=January 26, 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"DefenseOne\">{{cite news|accessdate=March 2, 2018|title=White Supremacists Killed More Americans Last Year Than Any Other Domestic-Extremist Group|url=http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2018/01/resurgent-threat-white-supremacist-violence/145243/|newspaper=Defense One}}</ref> Opposition to the alt-right has come from many areas of the political spectrum including [[Socialism in the United States|socialists]], [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]].

At that point, he argued, the government would deport all undocumented migrants from the country and then introduce measures to encourage all other non-whites to emigrate from the country.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=16}} Other alt-rightists are critical of the idea of breaking up the United States into ethno-states, arguing that this would mean breaking up the country that their Euro-American ancestors fought to build.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}} They instead argue for restrictive immigration policies to ensure that the U.S. continues to be a white-majority state.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\nRather than seeking independent white ethno-states, some alt-rightists promote a pan-white empire spanning Europe and North America.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=172}} Spencer noted that he did not want his proposed white ethno-state to be small, and that he wanted it to eventually form part of \"a global empire... something on a very large scale. And that is a homeland for all white people, whether you're German or Celtic or Slavic or English.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=24\u201325}} He described this as \"one big [[Roman Empire]]\" and suggested that it should engage in imperial expansion into the [[Near East]], focusing on conquering [[Istanbul]]; in Spencer's words, Istanbul was \"such a profoundly symbolic city. Retaking it, that would be a statement to the world.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=25}} He added that its present [[Turkish people|Turkish]] inhabitants would be made to leave, for they could go to \"the Middle East or something.

Heimbach for instance has addressed meetings of the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] in Greece and the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Michael|2019|p=74}} Various U.S.-based alt-rightists used social media to encourage support for the [[Alternative for Germany]] party in that country's [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]].{{sfn|Morstatter|Galstyan|Shao|Karunasekera|2018|p=621}}\n\n== Tactics ==\nAlt-rightists often make reference to [[freedom of speech]] when calling for their views to be heard in public discourse.{{sfn|Hofmann-Kuroda|2017|p=369}} A recurrent tactic of alt-rightists is to present themselves\u2014as white men\u2014as victims of oppression and prejudice; this subverts many leftist arguments about other social groupings being victims and is designed to infuriate leftist opponents.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=73}}\n\nThe alt-right also make heavy use of imagery drawn from popular culture for its own purposes.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|pp=256\u2013257}} For instance, the American singer [[Taylor Swift]] is often held up as an idealised example of \"Aryan\" beauty.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=257}} When describing their own conversion to the movement, alt-rightists refer to themselves as having been \"getting red pilled\", a reference to a scene in the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'' in which Neo, the protagonist, chooses to discover the truth behind reality by consuming a red pill.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=83|2a1=Kelly|2y=2017|2p=74|3a1=Niewert|3y=2017|3p=257}} On alt-right blogs and message boards, members often discuss how they were \"red-pilled\" originally.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=83\u201384}} Alt-rightists have also adopted [[milk]] as a symbol of their views; various members have used the words \"Heil Milk\" in their online posts while Spencer included an [[emoji]] of a glass of milk on his Twitter profile along with the statement that he was \"very tolerant... lactose tolerant!\"{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|p=104}} The [[animal studies]] scholar Vasile St\u0103nescu suggested that this notion drew upon the 19th century pseudoscientific idea that Northern Europeans had become biologically superior to many other human populations because they consumed high quantities of milk and meat products.{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n=== Use of humor and irony ===\n\nThe alt-right makes strong use of humor and irony in its rhetoric.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=20|2a1=Niewert|2y=2017|2p=256}} As noted by Nagle, the alt-right's use of humor renders it difficult to tell \"what political views were genuinely held and what were merely, as they used to say, for the lulz.\"{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=2}} The alt-right presented an image which was much less threatening than that of earlier white nationalist groups, and thus was able to attract people who would be willing to visit alt-right websites who would not have considered attending neo-Nazi or KKK events.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=25}} As noted by Hawley, \"whereas older white nationalists came across as bitter, reactionary, and antisocial, much of the Alt-Right comes across as youthful, light-hearted, and jovial\u2014even as it says the most abhorrent things about racial and religious minorities.\"{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} Members of the alt-right sometimes made fun of the earnestness and seriousness of earlier white nationalists such as William Pierce.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=76}}\n\nAnother of the tactics employed online by alt-rightists is to parody their leftist opponents. One teenaged American alt-rightist for instance created a Twitter account for a fictional individual whom they described as an \"LGBTQ+ pansexual nonbinary POC transwoman\" who was a \"Journalist for BLM. Always stayin [[woke]]\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=49\u201350}} Alt-rightists also orchestrated pranks, again to cause alarm among opponents. For instance, during the 2016 presidential campaign alt-rightists presented claims that they were plotting to send representatives posing as officials to voting booths where they would suppress ethnic minority turnout. There was no such plot, but press sources like ''[[Politico]]'' picked up on the claims and presented them as fact.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=75\u201376}} Such incidents reflected the alt-right's willingness to lie to advance their interests.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=75}} This tendency toward trolling renders it difficult for journalists to learn more about the alt-right because those members they talked to were willing to deceive them for their amusement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=74}}\n\nNagle suggested that the alt-right's use of such tactics made it strongly transgressive and thus part of a tradition that she traced back to the work of the [[Marquis de Sade]] in the 18th century.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=28\u201329}} She argued that it was with the alt-right that \"the transgressive anti-moral style\" reached \"its final detachment from any egalitarian philosophy of the left or Christian morality of the right\".{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=39}}\n\n===Use of memes===\n[[File:Feels good

In contrast, he thought, older white nationalists were keener to retain links to patriotic American imagery because they nostalgically recalled a period of U.S. history when segregation and overt white dominance were a part of life and believed that this system could be reinstated.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nWendling believed that a large portion of the alt-right were university students or recent graduates, many bearing a particular grudge against political correctness.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=8}} The alt-right ideologue Greg Johnson suggested that the alt-right was drawing in better educated people than previous white nationalist movements because the career prospects for college-educated European Americans had declined by the late 2000s. Whereas a college degree was previously perceived as a guaranteed ticket to a middle-class lifestyle, he noted that this was no longer the case and that many college and university educated people felt resentful and, due to unemployment or underemployment, had growing amounts of time on their hands which they could spend on the Internet.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nYiannopoulos claimed that some \"young rebels\" are drawn to the alt-right not for deeply political reasons, but \"because it promises fun, transgression, and a challenge to social norms\". According to ''The New Yorker'', \"testing the strength of the speech taboos that revolve around conventional politics-of what can be said, and how directly\" is a major component of alt-right identity. The beliefs that make the alt-right perceptible as a movement \"are in their essence not matters of substance but of style\" and the alt-right's tone may just be concealing \"a more familiar politics\".<ref>{{cite article |last=Wallace-Wells |first=Benjamin |date=May 5, 2016 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/benjamin-wallace-wells/is-the-alt-right-for-real |title=Is the Alt-Right for Real? |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA research study of 447 self-identified alt-right members found higher levels of dark triad traits compared to the general population; and that members of the alt-right were more likely to express prejudice against black people and admit to engaging in aggressive behavior. Alt-right members also had significantly high levels of dehumanization, with the mean alt-right scores comparable to how the general public views the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].

In her view, much of the \"groundwork\" for this discourse was set forth by the conservative movement in the years following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=69}} Hawley concurred that American conservatism was \"at least somewhat responsible for the rise of the Alt-Right\" because some individuals within the conservative movement, such as [[Ann Coulter]], had \"effectively delegitimized complaints about hate speech and racism\" as part of their attacks on political correctness in the years before the alt-right's appearance.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=44}} This is something acknowledged by some conservatives, like columnist [[Matt K. Lewis]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nCommentator [[Angela Nagle]] said that a mainstream \"alt-light\" more interested in performance than political goals helped the alt-right in its rise, saying that should the alt-right grow to generate great violence, those on the right who helped to make the alt-right look attractive, such as Yiannopoulos, \"will have to take responsibility for having played their role\" in enabling its growth.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=9}} She also suggested that \"the hysterical liberal call-out\" culture of the 2010s, in which \"everyone from saccharine pop stars to [[Justin Trudeau]] [was called] a 'white supremacist' and everyone who wasn't [[2016 United States presidential election#Notable expressions, phrases, and statements|With Her]] a sexist\" made it more difficult for people to recognize when a far-right movement really emerged online; she compared the situation with the tale of [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]].{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=8\u20139}} Disagreeing with Nagle's view that the alt-right was primarily a \"response to the stupidity of marginal Internet liberalism\", the anti-fascist reporter Jay Firestone\u2014who had spent three months undercover in New York's alt-right community\u2014instead argued that it was a \"response to decades of decline in standards of living for working people, amid the proliferation of unemployment and meaningless, dead-end jobs.\"<ref>{{cite article |last=Firestone |first=Jay |title=Three Months Inside Alt-Right New York |website=Commune |date=Spring 2019 |url=https://communemag.com/alt-right-new-york/ |accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Philip W. Gray cited several reasons for the emergence of the alt-right. In his analysis, new online media had reduced the conservative movement's ability to enforce its boundaries against the far right, while the growing distance of the Second World War meant that pride in the U.S. victory over Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy provided less of a barrier to the American far-right than it had when there were still large numbers of people who remembered the conflict.{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=151\u2013152}} Gray also argued that the alt-right was a reaction against the left-wing racial and social agitation of the 2010s, in particular the Black Lives Matter movement and the popularisation of concepts like [[white privilege]] and [[male privilege]], as well as events like the racial unrest in [[2015 Baltimore protests|Baltimore]] and [[Ferguson unrest|Ferguson]] and the shooting of police officers in [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|Dallas]] and [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|Baton Rouge]].{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n== Links to violence and terrorism ==\n{{quote box\n|quote=The sprawling networks the alt-right has built around its poisonous, racist ideology have violence at its core in its pursuit of a white ethnostate.

He noted that if the left wanted to continue using identity politics as the basis of much of its mobilization, it would have to accept [[white identity politics]] as a permanent fixture of the political landscape.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=160}} Similarly, in highlighting the commonalities between alt-right and \"left-identitarian\" forms of identity politics, Gray suggested the alt-right's presence might encourage \"the intersectional Left and its allies\" to increasingly critique the theoretical basis on which their own identity politics is built.{{sfn|Gray|2018|p=153}} Other commentators, like the conservative [[David Frum]], have suggested that if issues like immigration policy were discussed more openly in public discourse, then the alt-right would no longer be able to monopolize them.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}}\n\nSome opponents sought to undermine the alt-right's stereotype of leftists as being devoid of humor and joy by using its own tactics of humor and irony against it. For instance, when alt-rightists became angry or upset, some of their opponents described them as \"snowflakes\" who were being \"triggered\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=221\u2013222}} Anti-fascist activists also adopted the alt-right's use of pranks; on several occasions they publicized events in which they were purportedly meeting to destroy Confederate monuments or gravestones. Alt-rightists mobilized to publicly defend these sites, only to find that no such anti-fascist event was happening at all.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=221}} Within feminist circles, the alt-right's desired future was repeatedly compared to the [[Republic of Gilead]], the fictional dystopia in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985) and its [[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|2017 television adaptation]].{{sfn|Marghitu|Johnson|2018|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Charlottesville \"Unite the Right\" Rally (35780272084).jpg|thumb|left|Counter-protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally.]]\n\nVarious opponents have also employed doxing, publicly revealing the identities and addresses of alt-rightists, many of whom had previously acted anonymously.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=166}} This tactic discourages individuals from involving themselves in alt-right activities to begin with, as they fear that should they be outed as alt-rightists they might face repercussions such as job loss, social ostracization, or violence.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=168}} From 2016 onward, some anti-fascist opponents of the alt-right also resorted to physical confrontation and violence against the movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=169}} On Trump's inauguration day, for example, a masked anti-fascist punched Spencer in the face when he was talking to reporters; the footage was widely shared online.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=169|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2pp=2\u20133}} Hawley noted that this tactic could be counter-productive to the anti-alt-right case, as it reinforces the narrative that alt-rightists peacefully engaging in their constitutionally-protected right to free speech were being victimized.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nOther commentators have called for more vigorous policing of the web by governments and companies to deal with the alt-right.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} If denied access to mainstream social media outlets, the alt-right would be restricted to far-right online venues like Stormfront, where it would be isolated and ignored from those not already committed to its cause.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=163}} Many in the alt-right concur that denying it access to social media would have a devastating effect on its ability to proselytize.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} It has however been suggested that such censorship could backfire, as it would play into the alt-right narrative that those campaigning for white interests were being marginalized by the establishment, thus aiding the movement's recruitment.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}} Suppressing the alt-right in this manner would also set a precedent which could be repeated for other groups in future, including leftist ones.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=165}} Phillips and Yi argued that such leftist attempts to prevent alt-right speech reflected an \"authoritarian shift\" which was becoming \"increasingly hegemonic\" within the American Left and that endorsed the view that \"limiting or preventing the public speech of historically privileged groups (typically, whites, males) is acceptable until power relations are equalized.\"{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\n== \"Alt-left\" ==\n{{anchor|Alt-left}}\nAfter the murder of a counter-protester at the Unite the Right Rally, in a press conference Trump stated that there was \"blame on both sides\" for the violence, stating that some of the counter-protesters were part of the \"very, very violent ... alt-left\".{{refn|<ref>Shear, Michael D. and Haberman, Maggie (August 15, 2017).

Pepe the Frog is an [[Internet meme]] which has been appropriated by the alt-right as a symbol of the movement.</ref>).]]\n\nThe '''alt-right''', an abbreviation of '''alternative right''', is a loosely connected [[Far-right politics|far-right]], [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] movement based in the United States. A largely [[Internet activism|online phenomenon]], the alt-right originated in the U.S. during the 2010s, although it has since established a presence in various other countries. The term is ill-defined, having been used in different ways by various self-described \"alt-rightists\", media commentators, and academics. Groups which have been identified as alt-right also espouse [[white supremacism]], [[white separatism]], [[anti-immigration|severe immigration restrictions]], and [[antisemitism]].\n\nIn 2010, the American white nationalist [[Richard B. Spencer]] launched ''The Alternative Right'' [[webzine]]. Spencer's \"alternative right\" was influenced by earlier forms of American white nationalism, as well as [[paleoconservatism]], the [[Dark Enlightenment]], and the [[Nouvelle Droite]]. His term was shortened to \"alt-right\" and popularised by far-right participants of [[/pol/]], the politics board of web forum [[4chan]]. It came to be associated with other white nationalist websites and groups, including Andrew Anglin's ''[[Daily Stormer]]'', Brad Griffin's ''Occidental Dissent'', and Matthew Heimbach's [[Traditionalist Worker Party]]. Following the 2014 [[Gamergate controversy]], the alt-right made increasing use of [[trolling]] and [[online harassment]] to raise its profile. In 2015, it attracted broader attention\u2014particularly through coverage on [[Steve Bannon]]'s [[Breitbart News]]\u2014due to alt-right support for [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]]. On [[2016 United States presidential election|being elected]], Trump renounced the movement. Attempting to move from a web-based to a street-based movement, Spencer and other alt-rightists organised the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], Virginia, which faced significant [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] opposition. After this, the movement began to decline.\n\nThe alt-right is a [[Scientific racism|biologically racist]] movement promoting a form of far-right [[identity politics]] for [[European Americans]]. Part of its membership supports [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrationist]] policies to ensure a continued white majority in the United States. Others call for the breakup of the country to form a [[white separatism|white separatist]] [[ethno-state]] in [[North America]]. Some alt-rightists seek to make white nationalism socially respectable in the U.S., while others\u2014known as the \"[[Fourteen Words|1488]]\" scene\u2014adopt openly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] stances. Some alt-rightists are [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]], promoting a [[conspiracy theory]] that there is [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|a Jewish plot]] to bring about [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]]; other alt-rightists view most Jews as members of the white race. The alt-right is [[anti-feminism|anti-feminist]], advocates for a more [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], and intersects with the [[men's rights movement]] and other sectors of the online [[manosphere]]. Alt-rightists generally support [[Anti-interventionism|anti-interventionist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]] [[Foreign policy|foreign policies]] alongside [[Protectionism|economic protectionism]]. Individuals aligned with many of the alt-right's ideas but not its white nationalism have been termed \"[[alt-lite]]\".\n\nThe alt-right distinguished itself from earlier forms of white nationalism through its largely online presence and its heavy use of irony and humor, particularly through the promotion of [[Internet memes]] like [[Pepe the Frog]]. Membership was overwhelmingly white and male, with academic and anti-fascist observers linking its growth to deteriorating living standards and prospects, anxieties about the place of white masculinity, and anger at increasingly visible [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] movements such as [[Black Lives Matter]].

At that point, he argued, the government would deport all undocumented migrants from the country and then introduce measures to encourage all other non-whites to emigrate from the country.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=16}} Other alt-rightists are critical of the idea of breaking up the United States into ethno-states, arguing that this would mean breaking up the country that their Euro-American ancestors fought to build.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}} They instead argue for restrictive immigration policies to ensure that the U.S. continues to be a white-majority state.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\nRather than seeking independent white ethno-states, some alt-rightists promote a pan-white empire spanning Europe and North America.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=172}} Spencer noted that he did not want his proposed white ethno-state to be small, and that he wanted it to eventually form part of \"a global empire... something on a very large scale. And that is a homeland for all white people, whether you're German or Celtic or Slavic or English.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=24\u201325}} He described this as \"one big [[Roman Empire]]\" and suggested that it should engage in imperial expansion into the [[Near East]], focusing on conquering [[Istanbul]]; in Spencer's words, Istanbul was \"such a profoundly symbolic city. Retaking it, that would be a statement to the world.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=25}} He added that its present [[Turkish people|Turkish]] inhabitants would be made to leave, for they could go to \"the Middle East or something.

Heimbach for instance has addressed meetings of the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] in Greece and the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Michael|2019|p=74}} Various U.S.-based alt-rightists used social media to encourage support for the [[Alternative for Germany]] party in that country's [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]].{{sfn|Morstatter|Galstyan|Shao|Karunasekera|2018|p=621}}\n\n== Tactics ==\nAlt-rightists often make reference to [[freedom of speech]] when calling for their views to be heard in public discourse.{{sfn|Hofmann-Kuroda|2017|p=369}} A recurrent tactic of alt-rightists is to present themselves\u2014as white men\u2014as victims of oppression and prejudice; this subverts many leftist arguments about other social groupings being victims and is designed to infuriate leftist opponents.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=73}}\n\nThe alt-right also make heavy use of imagery drawn from popular culture for its own purposes.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|pp=256\u2013257}} For instance, the American singer [[Taylor Swift]] is often held up as an idealised example of \"Aryan\" beauty.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=257}} When describing their own conversion to the movement, alt-rightists refer to themselves as having been \"getting red pilled\", a reference to a scene in the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'' in which Neo, the protagonist, chooses to discover the truth behind reality by consuming a red pill.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=83|2a1=Kelly|2y=2017|2p=74|3a1=Niewert|3y=2017|3p=257}} On alt-right blogs and message boards, members often discuss how they were \"red-pilled\" originally.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=83\u201384}} Alt-rightists have also adopted [[milk]] as a symbol of their views; various members have used the words \"Heil Milk\" in their online posts while Spencer included an [[emoji]] of a glass of milk on his Twitter profile along with the statement that he was \"very tolerant... lactose tolerant!\"{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|p=104}} The [[animal studies]] scholar Vasile St\u0103nescu suggested that this notion drew upon the 19th century pseudoscientific idea that Northern Europeans had become biologically superior to many other human populations because they consumed high quantities of milk and meat products.{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n=== Use of humor and irony ===\n\nThe alt-right makes strong use of humor and irony in its rhetoric.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=20|2a1=Niewert|2y=2017|2p=256}} As noted by Nagle, the alt-right's use of humor renders it difficult to tell \"what political views were genuinely held and what were merely, as they used to say, for the lulz.\"{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=2}} The alt-right presented an image which was much less threatening than that of earlier white nationalist groups, and thus was able to attract people who would be willing to visit alt-right websites who would not have considered attending neo-Nazi or KKK events.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=25}} As noted by Hawley, \"whereas older white nationalists came across as bitter, reactionary, and antisocial, much of the Alt-Right comes across as youthful, light-hearted, and jovial\u2014even as it says the most abhorrent things about racial and religious minorities.\"{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} Members of the alt-right sometimes made fun of the earnestness and seriousness of earlier white nationalists such as William Pierce.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=76}}\n\nAnother of the tactics employed online by alt-rightists is to parody their leftist opponents. One teenaged American alt-rightist for instance created a Twitter account for a fictional individual whom they described as an \"LGBTQ+ pansexual nonbinary POC transwoman\" who was a \"Journalist for BLM. Always stayin [[woke]]\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=49\u201350}} Alt-rightists also orchestrated pranks, again to cause alarm among opponents. For instance, during the 2016 presidential campaign alt-rightists presented claims that they were plotting to send representatives posing as officials to voting booths where they would suppress ethnic minority turnout. There was no such plot, but press sources like ''[[Politico]]'' picked up on the claims and presented them as fact.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=75\u201376}} Such incidents reflected the alt-right's willingness to lie to advance their interests.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=75}} This tendency toward trolling renders it difficult for journalists to learn more about the alt-right because those members they talked to were willing to deceive them for their amusement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=74}}\n\nNagle suggested that the alt-right's use of such tactics made it strongly transgressive and thus part of a tradition that she traced back to the work of the [[Marquis de Sade]] in the 18th century.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=28\u201329}} She argued that it was with the alt-right that \"the transgressive anti-moral style\" reached \"its final detachment from any egalitarian philosophy of the left or Christian morality of the right\".{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=39}}\n\n===Use of memes===\n[[File:Feels good

In contrast, he thought, older white nationalists were keener to retain links to patriotic American imagery because they nostalgically recalled a period of U.S. history when segregation and overt white dominance were a part of life and believed that this system could be reinstated.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nWendling believed that a large portion of the alt-right were university students or recent graduates, many bearing a particular grudge against political correctness.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=8}} The alt-right ideologue Greg Johnson suggested that the alt-right was drawing in better educated people than previous white nationalist movements because the career prospects for college-educated European Americans had declined by the late 2000s. Whereas a college degree was previously perceived as a guaranteed ticket to a middle-class lifestyle, he noted that this was no longer the case and that many college and university educated people felt resentful and, due to unemployment or underemployment, had growing amounts of time on their hands which they could spend on the Internet.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nYiannopoulos claimed that some \"young rebels\" are drawn to the alt-right not for deeply political reasons, but \"because it promises fun, transgression, and a challenge to social norms\". According to ''The New Yorker'', \"testing the strength of the speech taboos that revolve around conventional politics-of what can be said, and how directly\" is a major component of alt-right identity. The beliefs that make the alt-right perceptible as a movement \"are in their essence not matters of substance but of style\" and the alt-right's tone may just be concealing \"a more familiar politics\".<ref>{{cite article |last=Wallace-Wells |first=Benjamin |date=May 5, 2016 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/benjamin-wallace-wells/is-the-alt-right-for-real |title=Is the Alt-Right for Real? |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA research study of 447 self-identified alt-right members found higher levels of dark triad traits compared to the general population; and that members of the alt-right were more likely to express prejudice against black people and admit to engaging in aggressive behavior. Alt-right members also had significantly high levels of dehumanization, with the mean alt-right scores comparable to how the general public views the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].

In her view, much of the \"groundwork\" for this discourse was set forth by the conservative movement in the years following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=69}} Hawley concurred that American conservatism was \"at least somewhat responsible for the rise of the Alt-Right\" because some individuals within the conservative movement, such as [[Ann Coulter]], had \"effectively delegitimized complaints about hate speech and racism\" as part of their attacks on political correctness in the years before the alt-right's appearance.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=44}} This is something acknowledged by some conservatives, like columnist [[Matt K. Lewis]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nCommentator [[Angela Nagle]] said that a mainstream \"alt-light\" more interested in performance than political goals helped the alt-right in its rise, saying that should the alt-right grow to generate great violence, those on the right who helped to make the alt-right look attractive, such as Yiannopoulos, \"will have to take responsibility for having played their role\" in enabling its growth.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=9}} She also suggested that \"the hysterical liberal call-out\" culture of the 2010s, in which \"everyone from saccharine pop stars to [[Justin Trudeau]] [was called] a 'white supremacist' and everyone who wasn't [[2016 United States presidential election#Notable expressions, phrases, and statements|With Her]] a sexist\" made it more difficult for people to recognize when a far-right movement really emerged online; she compared the situation with the tale of [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]].{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=8\u20139}} Disagreeing with Nagle's view that the alt-right was primarily a \"response to the stupidity of marginal Internet liberalism\", the anti-fascist reporter Jay Firestone\u2014who had spent three months undercover in New York's alt-right community\u2014instead argued that it was a \"response to decades of decline in standards of living for working people, amid the proliferation of unemployment and meaningless, dead-end jobs.\"<ref>{{cite article |last=Firestone |first=Jay |title=Three Months Inside Alt-Right New York |website=Commune |date=Spring 2019 |url=https://communemag.com/alt-right-new-york/ |accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Philip W. Gray cited several reasons for the emergence of the alt-right. In his analysis, new online media had reduced the conservative movement's ability to enforce its boundaries against the far right, while the growing distance of the Second World War meant that pride in the U.S. victory over Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy provided less of a barrier to the American far-right than it had when there were still large numbers of people who remembered the conflict.{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=151\u2013152}} Gray also argued that the alt-right was a reaction against the left-wing racial and social agitation of the 2010s, in particular the Black Lives Matter movement and the popularisation of concepts like [[white privilege]] and [[male privilege]], as well as events like the racial unrest in [[2015 Baltimore protests|Baltimore]] and [[Ferguson unrest|Ferguson]] and the shooting of police officers in [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|Dallas]] and [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|Baton Rouge]].{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n== Links to violence and terrorism ==\n{{quote box\n|quote=The sprawling networks the alt-right has built around its poisonous, racist ideology have violence at its core in its pursuit of a white ethnostate.

He noted that if the left wanted to continue using identity politics as the basis of much of its mobilization, it would have to accept [[white identity politics]] as a permanent fixture of the political landscape.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=160}} Similarly, in highlighting the commonalities between alt-right and \"left-identitarian\" forms of identity politics, Gray suggested the alt-right's presence might encourage \"the intersectional Left and its allies\" to increasingly critique the theoretical basis on which their own identity politics is built.{{sfn|Gray|2018|p=153}} Other commentators, like the conservative [[David Frum]], have suggested that if issues like immigration policy were discussed more openly in public discourse, then the alt-right would no longer be able to monopolize them.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}}\n\nSome opponents sought to undermine the alt-right's stereotype of leftists as being devoid of humor and joy by using its own tactics of humor and irony against it. For instance, when alt-rightists became angry or upset, some of their opponents described them as \"snowflakes\" who were being \"triggered\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=221\u2013222}} Anti-fascist activists also adopted the alt-right's use of pranks; on several occasions they publicized events in which they were purportedly meeting to destroy Confederate monuments or gravestones. Alt-rightists mobilized to publicly defend these sites, only to find that no such anti-fascist event was happening at all.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=221}} Within feminist circles, the alt-right's desired future was repeatedly compared to the [[Republic of Gilead]], the fictional dystopia in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985) and its [[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|2017 television adaptation]].{{sfn|Marghitu|Johnson|2018|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Charlottesville \"Unite the Right\" Rally (35780272084).jpg|thumb|left|Counter-protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally.]]\n\nVarious opponents have also employed doxing, publicly revealing the identities and addresses of alt-rightists, many of whom had previously acted anonymously.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=166}} This tactic discourages individuals from involving themselves in alt-right activities to begin with, as they fear that should they be outed as alt-rightists they might face repercussions such as job loss, social ostracization, or violence.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=168}} From 2016 onward, some anti-fascist opponents of the alt-right also resorted to physical confrontation and violence against the movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=169}} On Trump's inauguration day, for example, a masked anti-fascist punched Spencer in the face when he was talking to reporters; the footage was widely shared online.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=169|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2pp=2\u20133}} Hawley noted that this tactic could be counter-productive to the anti-alt-right case, as it reinforces the narrative that alt-rightists peacefully engaging in their constitutionally-protected right to free speech were being victimized.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nOther commentators have called for more vigorous policing of the web by governments and companies to deal with the alt-right.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} If denied access to mainstream social media outlets, the alt-right would be restricted to far-right online venues like Stormfront, where it would be isolated and ignored from those not already committed to its cause.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=163}} Many in the alt-right concur that denying it access to social media would have a devastating effect on its ability to proselytize.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} It has however been suggested that such censorship could backfire, as it would play into the alt-right narrative that those campaigning for white interests were being marginalized by the establishment, thus aiding the movement's recruitment.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}} Suppressing the alt-right in this manner would also set a precedent which could be repeated for other groups in future, including leftist ones.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=165}} Phillips and Yi argued that such leftist attempts to prevent alt-right speech reflected an \"authoritarian shift\" which was becoming \"increasingly hegemonic\" within the American Left and that endorsed the view that \"limiting or preventing the public speech of historically privileged groups (typically, whites, males) is acceptable until power relations are equalized.\"{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\n== \"Alt-left\" ==\n{{anchor|Alt-left}}\nAfter the murder of a counter-protester at the Unite the Right Rally, in a press conference Trump stated that there was \"blame on both sides\" for the violence, stating that some of the counter-protesters were part of the \"very, very violent ... alt-left\".{{refn|<ref>Shear, Michael D. and Haberman, Maggie (August 15, 2017).
