Following the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], the decisive point in the [[ethnogenesis]] of the South Slavic ethnic group was the creation of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after World War II, a state in the framework of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%),  mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called [[May Manifesto]], in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.<ref>Victor Roudometof, ''Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History)'', Praeger, 2001, p.187</ref> In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]] was created, composed of former left-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) members.

The sense of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation gained credence during World War II when ethnic Macedonian communist partisan detachments were formed. In 1943 the Communist Party of Macedonia was established and the resistance movement grew up. After the World War II ethnic Macedonian institutions were created in the three parts of the region of Macedonia, then under communist control,<ref name=\"Barbara Jelavich\">History of the Balkans, Vol. 2: Twentieth Century.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)... Like Kosovo, Macedonia was slated for Serb settlements and internal colonization. The authorities projected the settlement of 50,000 families in Macedonia, though only 4,200 families had been placed in 280 colonies by 1940.\" For more see: Ivo Banac,  \"The National Question in Yugoslavia.

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs, and to create an national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

The anti-Bulgariansim (or Bulgarophobia) increased almost to the level of state ideology during the ideological monopoly of the League of Communists of Macedonia, and still continues to do so today, although with less ferocity... However, it is more important to say openly that a great deal of these anti-Bulgarian sentiments result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian nations. Macedonia could confirm itself as a state with its own past, present and future only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. For more see: Mirjana Maleska.

It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw.

The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume.

The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II.

The suffering during the wars, the endless struggle of the Balkan monarchies for dominance over the population increased the Macedonians' sentiment that the institutionalization of an independent Macedonian nation would put an end to their suffering.

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%),  mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called [[May Manifesto]], in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.<ref>Victor Roudometof, ''Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History)'', Praeger, 2001, p.187</ref> In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]] was created, composed of former left-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) members.

The Balkan communist parties supported the national consolidation of the ethnic Macedonian people and created Macedonian sections within the parties, headed by prominent IMRO (United) members. The sense of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation gained credence during World War II when ethnic Macedonian communist partisan detachments were formed. In 1943 the Communist Party of Macedonia was established and the resistance movement grew up. After the World War II ethnic Macedonian institutions were created in the three parts of the region of Macedonia, then under communist control,<ref name=\"Barbara Jelavich\">History of the Balkans, Vol. 2: Twentieth Century.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)... Like Kosovo, Macedonia was slated for Serb settlements and internal colonization.

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs, and to create an national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

However, it is more important to say openly that a great deal of these anti-Bulgarian sentiments result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian nations.

They have a special reserved seat in the nations parliament. In 2002, they numbered 731. (See also ''[[Macedonians in Romania]]''.)\n* '''Slovenia''': Ethnic Macedonians began relocating to Slovenia in the 1950s when the two regions formed a part of a single country, [[Yugoslavia]]. (See also ''[[Macedonians in Slovenia]]''.)\n\nOther significant ethnic Macedonian communities can also be found in the other Western European countries such as Austria, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom and the whole European Union. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Also in Uruguay, with a significant population in [[Montevideo]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe culture of the people is characterized with both traditionalist and modernist attributes. It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw. Pantelejmona (02).jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the well-known monasteries \u2013 [[Saint Panteleimon, Ohrid|St. Panteleimon]] in Ohrid.]]\n\nMost Macedonians are members of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church]]. The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume. In the center of such a circular room there are mountains, rivers, lakes and the sun. All this is said to represent \"the richness of our country, our struggle, and our freedom\".\n\n'''Unofficial symbols'''\n* '''''[[Golden Lion of North Macedonia|Lion]]''''': The lion first appears in the [[Fojnica Armorial]] from 17th century, where the coat of arms of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] is included among those of other entities. On the coat of arms is a crown; inside a yellow crowned lion is depicted standing rampant, on a red background. On the bottom enclosed in a red and yellow border is written \"Macedonia\".

The [[Vergina]] Sun is believed to have been associated with [[Greeks|ancient Greek]] kings such as [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], although it was used as an ornamental design long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II.

The first event happened less than a decade before the publication of Bilbao's and Torres Caicedo works: the Invasion of Mexico or, in USA the [[Mexican- American war|Mexican\u2013American War]], after which Mexico lost a third of its territory. The second event, the [[Walker affair]], happened the same year both works were written: the decision by U.S. president [[Franklin Pierce]] to recognize the regime recently established in Nicaragua by American [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] and his band of filibusters who ruled Nicaragua for nearly a year (1856\u201357) and attempted to reinstate slavery there, where it had been already abolished for three decades\n\nIn both Bilbao's and Torres Caicedo's works, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican-American War]] and Walker's expedition to Nicaragua are explicitly mentioned as examples of dangers for the region.  For Bilbao, \"Latin America\" was not a geographical concept, since he excluded Brazil, Paraguay and Mexico.  Both authors also ask for the union of all Latin American countries as the only way to defend their territories against further foreign U.S. interventions. Both rejected also European imperialism, claiming that the return of European countries to non-democratic forms of government was another danger for Latin American countries, and used the same word to describe the state of European politics at the time: \"despotism.\"  Several years later, during the [[French invasion of Mexico]], Bilbao wrote another work, \"Emancipation of the Spirit in America,\" where he asked all Latin American countries to support the Mexican cause against France, and rejected French imperialism in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. He asked Latin American intellectuals to search for their \"intellectual emancipation\" by abandoning all French ideas, claiming that France was: \"Hypocrite, because she [France] calls herself protector of the Latin race just to subject it to her exploitation regime; treacherous, because she speaks of freedom and nationality, when, unable to conquer freedom for herself, she enslaves others instead!\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bilbao |first1=Francisco |title=Emancipaci\u00f3n del esp\u00edritu de Am\u00e9rica |url=http://www.franciscobilbao.cl/1909/article-81905.html |website=Francisco Bilbao Barqu\u00edn, 1823\u20131865, Chile|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> Therefore, as Michel Gobat puts it, the term Latin America itself had an \"anti-imperial genesis,\" and their creators were far from supporting any form of imperialism in the region, or in any other place of the globe.\n\nHowever, in France the term Latin America was used with the opposite intention. It was employed by the French Empire of [[Napoleon III]] during the French invasion of Mexico as a way to include France among countries with influence in the Americas and to exclude [[Anglo America|Anglophone countries]]. It played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area, and install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor of the [[Second Mexican Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Chasteen |first1=John Charles |authorlink1= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |title=Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fC90B5xkYyIC&lpg=PA156&pg=PP1#v=onepage |accessdate=4 July 2010 |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2001 |origyear= |publisher=[[W.

Neither area is culturally or linguistically homogeneous; in substantial portions of Latin America (e.g., highland [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]]), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures and, to a lesser extent, Amerindian languages, are predominant, and in other areas, the influence of African cultures is strong (e.g., the Caribbean basin{{spaced ndash}}including parts of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]).\n\nThe term is not without controversy.  Historian Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo explores at length the \"allure and power\" of the idea of Latin America. He remarks at the outset, \"The idea of 'Latin America' ought to have vanished with the obsolescence of racial theory... But it is not easy to declare something dead when it can hardly be said to have existed,\" going on to say, \"The term is here to stay, and it is important.\"<ref>Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo, ''Latin America: The Allure and Power of an Idea''.

3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Maya Civilization|Mayan]] archeological site [[Chichen Itza]]. ]]\n\nThe earliest known settlement was identified at [[Monte Verde]], near [[Puerto Montt]] in Southern Chile. Its occupation dates to some 14,000 years ago and there is some disputed evidence of even earlier occupation. Over the course of millennia, people spread to all parts of the continents. By the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]], South America's vast rainforests, mountains, plains and coasts were the home of tens of millions of people. The earliest settlements in the Americas are of the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas Culture]]<ref>The preceramic Las Vegas culture of coastal Ecuador https://www.jstor.org/pss/280325</ref> from about 8000&nbsp;BCE and 4600&nbsp;BCE, a sedentary group from the coast of [[Ecuador]], the forefathers of the more known [[Valdivia culture]], of the same era. Some groups formed more permanent settlements such as the [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] (or \"[[Muisca people|Muisca]]\" or \"Muysca\") and the [[Tairona]] groups. These groups are in the circum Caribbean region. The Chibchas of [[Colombia]], the [[Quechuas]] and [[Aymaras]] of [[Bolivia]] were the three indigenous groups that settled most permanently.\n\nThe region was home to many [[indigenous peoples]] and advanced civilizations, including the [[Aztecs]], [[Toltecs]], [[Maya Civilization|Maya]], and [[Inca]]. The [[golden age]] of the Maya began about 250, with the last two great [[civilization]]s, the Aztecs and Incas, emerging into prominence later on in the early fourteenth century and mid-fifteenth centuries, respectively. The Aztec empire was ultimately the most powerful civilization known throughout the Americas, until its downfall in part by the Spanish invasion.\n\n===European colonization===\n{{Main|European colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n{{see also|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\n[[File:Desembarco de Col\u00f3n de Di\u00f3scoro Puebla.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.00|[[Romanticism|Romantic]] painting of Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] arriving to the Americas (''Primer desembarco de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n en Am\u00e9rica''), by [[Di\u00f3scoro Puebla]] (1862)]]\n[[File:Jal-ixco.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|[[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]] leads [[Spain|Spanish]] soldiers with [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]]n allies against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous warriors]] during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|European colonization of the Americas]].]]\n\nWith the arrival of the Europeans following [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages, the indigenous elites, such as the Incas and Aztecs, lost power to the heavy European invasion. [[Hern\u00e1ndo Cort\u00e9s]] seized the Aztec elite's power with the help of local groups who had favored the Aztec elite, and [[Francisco Pizarro]] eliminated the Incan rule in Peru. The European powers of Spain and Portugal colonized the region, which along with the rest of the uncolonized world, was divided into areas of Spanish and Portuguese control by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|line of demarcation]] in 1494, which gave Spain all areas to the west, and Portugal all areas to the east (the Portuguese lands in South America subsequently becoming Brazil). By the end of the sixteenth century Spain and Portugal had been joined by others, including France, in occupying large areas of North, Central and South America, ultimately extending from Alaska to the southern tips of the [[Patagonia]]. European culture, customs and government were introduced, with the Roman Catholic Church becoming the major economic and political power to overrule the traditional ways of the region, eventually becoming the only official religion of the Americas during this period.\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nEpidemics of diseases brought by the Europeans, such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], wiped out a large portion of the indigenous population. Historians cannot determine the number of natives who died due to European diseases, but some put the figures as high as 85% and as low as 25%. Due to the lack of written records, specific numbers are hard to verify. Many of the survivors were forced to work in European plantations and mines. [[Miscegenation|Intermixing]] between the indigenous peoples and the European colonists was very common, and, by the end of the [[Colonialism|colonial period]], people of mixed ancestry ([[mestizo]]s) formed majorities in several colonies.\n\n====Slavery and forced labor in colonial Latin America====\n{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}\n{{see|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries.\n\nThe Mita of Colonial Latin America was a system of forced labor imposed on the natives. First established by Viceroy Francisco de Toledo (1569\u20131581), the Mita was upheld by laws that designated how large draft levies were and how much money the workers would receive that was based on how many shifts each individual worker performed. Toledo established Mitas at Potosi and Huancavelica, where the Mitayos\u2014the workers\u2014would be reduced in number to a fraction of how many were originally assigned before the 1700s. While several villages managed to resist the Mita, others offered payment to colonial administrators as a way out. In exchange, free labor became available through volunteers, though the Mita was kept in place as workers like miners, for example, were paid low wages. The Spanish Crown had not made any ruling on the Mita or approved of it when Toledo first established it in spite of the uncertainty of the practice since the Crown could have gained benefits from it. However, the cortes of Spain later abolished it in 1812 once complaints of the Mita violating humanitarian rights were made. Yet complaints also came from: governors; landowners; native leaders known as Kurakas; and even priests, each of whom preferred other methods of economic exploitation. Despite its fall, the Mita made it to the 1800s.<ref>Brown, K. W. (2008). Mita. In J. Kinsbruner & E. D. Langer (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture (2nd ed., Vol. 4, pp. 635\u2013636). Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons.</ref>\n\nAnother important group of slaves to mention were the slaves brought over from Africa. The first slaves came over with Christopher Columbus from the very beginning on his earliest voyages. However in the few hundred years, the Atlantic Slave trade would begin delivering slaves, imported by Spain and other colonizers, by the millions. Many of the large scale productions were run by forced slave labor. They were a part of sugar and coffee production, farming (beans, rice, corn, fruit, etc.), Mining, whale oil and multiple other jobs. Slaves were also house workers, servants, military soldiers, and much more. To say the least these people were property and treated as such. Though indigenous slaves existed, they were no match in quantity and lack of quality jobs when compared to the African slave. The slave population was massive compared to the better known slave ownership in the United States. After 1860 Brazil alone had imported over 4 million slaves, which only represented about 35% of the Atlantic slave trade. Despite the large number of slaves in Latin America, there was not as much reproduction of slaves amongst the population. Because most of the slaves then were African-born, they were more subject to rebellion. The United States involvement in the slave trade is well known amongst North America, however it hides a larger and in some ways crueler operation in the south which had a much longer history.{{sfnp|Meade|2016|pp=53\u201357}}\n\n===Independence (1804\u20131825)===\n{{Main|Latin American wars of independence|Spanish American wars of independence}}\n[[File:Bolivar Arturo Michelena.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.70|[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], Liberator of [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Panama]]]]\n\nIn 1804, Haiti became the first Latin American nation to gain independence, following a violent slave revolt led by [[Toussaint L'ouverture]] on the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]]. The victors abolished slavery. Haitian independence inspired independence movements in Spanish America.\n[[File:Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla.png|thumbnail|right|upright=0.70|[[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] was the first leader of the [[Mexican War of Independence]].]]\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, Spanish and Portuguese power waned on the global scene as other European powers took their place, notably Britain and France. Resentment grew among the majority of the population in Latin America over the restrictions imposed by the Spanish government, as well as the dominance of native Spaniards (Iberian-born ''[[Peninsulares]]'') in the major social and political [[institution]]s. [[Napoleon]]'s invasion of Spain in 1808 marked a turning point, compelling [[Criollo people|Criollo]] elites to form [[junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]] that advocated independence. Also, the newly independent [[Haiti]], the second oldest nation in the [[New World]] after the United States, further fueled the independence movement by inspiring the leaders of the movement, such as [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] of Mexico, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] of Venezuela and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina, and by providing them with considerable munitions and troops.\n\nFighting soon broke out between juntas and the Spanish colonial authorities, with initial victories for the advocates of independence. Eventually, these early movements were crushed by the [[Royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist troops]] by 1810, including those of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] in [[Mexico]] in the year 1810. Later on [[Francisco de Miranda]] in [[Venezuela]] by 1812. Under the leadership of a new generation of leaders, such as [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] \"The Liberator\", [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina, and other ''[[Libertadores]]'' in South America, the independence movement regained strength, and by 1825, all [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], except for Puerto Rico and Cuba, had gained independence from Spain. In the same year in [[Mexico]], a military officer, [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], led a coalition of conservatives and liberals who created a [[constitutional monarchy]], with Iturbide as [[emperor]]. This [[First Mexican Empire]] was short-lived, and was followed by the creation of a [[republic]] in 1823.\n\n====Independent Empire of Brazil====\n{{Main|Independence of Brazil|Empire of Brazil}}\n[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|left|Declaration of the [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazilian independence]] by the later [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro&nbsp;I]] on September 7, 1822]]\n\nThe [[Brazilian War of Independence]], which had already begun along other independent movements around the region, spread through northern, northeastern regions and in Cisplatina province.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp.&nbsp;168, 164, 178</ref> With the last Portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 March 1824,<ref name=\"Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp. 179\u2013180\">Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp.&nbsp;179\u2013180</ref> Portugal officially recognized Brazil on 29 August 1825.<ref name=\"Lustosa, p. 208\">Lustosa, p.&nbsp;208</ref>\n\n[[File:Pedro Am\u00e9rico - D.

''El liberalismo hispanoamericano'' en el siglo XIX. pg2</ref> Conservatism was the dominant system of government prior to the revolutions and it was founded on having social classes, including governing by kings. Liberalists wanted to see a change in the ruling systems, and to move away from monarchs and social classes in order to promote equality.\n\nWhen liberal [[Guadalupe Victoria]] became the first president of Mexico in 1824, conservatists relied on their belief that the state had been better off before the new government came into power, so, by comparison, the old government was better in the eyes of the Conservatives. Following this sentiment, the conservatives pushed to take control of the government, and they succeeded. [[General Santa Anna]] was elected president in 1833. The following decade, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u201348) caused Mexico to lose a significant amount of territory to the United States. This loss led to a rebellion by the enraged liberal forces against the conservative government.\n\nIn 1837, conservative [[Rafael Carrera]] conquered [[Guatemala]] and separated from the [[Central American Union]]. The instability that followed the disintegration of the union led to the independence of the other Central American countries.\n\nIn [[Brazil]], rural aristocrats were in conflict with the urban conservatives. Portuguese control over Brazilian ports continued after Brazil's independence. Following the conservative idea that the old government was better, urbanites tended to support conservatism because more opportunities were available to them as a result of the Portuguese presence.\n\n[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] became president of [[Gran Colombia]] in 1819 after the region gained independence from Spain. He led a military-controlled state. Citizens did not like the government's position under Bol\u00edvar: The people in the military were unhappy with their roles, and the civilians were of the opinion that the military had too much power. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia, New Grenada continued to have conflicts between conservatives and liberals. These conflicts were each concentrated in particular regions, with conservatives particularly in the southern mountains and the Valley of Cauca. In the mid-1840s some leaders in Caracas organized a liberal opposition. Antonio Leocadio Guzman was an active participant and journalist in this movement and gained much popularity among the people of Caracas.<ref>Halper\u00edn Donghi, T. (2013). ''Historia contempor\u00e1nea de Am\u00e9rica latina''. Madrid: Alianza.</ref>\n\nIn [[Argentina]], the conflict manifested itself as a prolonged civil war between ''[[Unitarian Party|unitarianas]]'' (i.e. ''centralists'') and ''[[Federales|federalists]]'', which were in some aspects respectively analogous to liberals and conservatives in other countries. Between 1832 and 1852, the country existed as a [[Argentine Confederation|confederation]], without a head of state, although the federalist governor of Buenos Aires province, [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], was given the powers of debt payment and international relations and exerted a growing hegemony over the country. A national constitution was only enacted in 1853, reformed in 1860, and the country reorganized as a federal republic led by a [[Generation of '80|liberal-conservative elite]].<ref>Galasso, N. (2011). ''Historia de la Argentina'' (Vol. 1).</ref> After Uruguay achieved its independence, in 1828, a similar polarization crystallized between ''blancos'' and ''colorados'', where the agrarian conservative interests were pitted against the liberal commercial interests based in Montevideo, and which eventually resulted in the ''[[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]]'' civil war (1839\u20131851).<ref>Hudson, R., & Meditz, S.

The British were able to capture large amounts of precious metals, before a French naval force intervened on behalf of the Spanish King and took down the invading force.

The next year the British attacked once again with a much larger force attempting to reach and conquer Montevideo.<ref>Donghi, 89</ref> They failed to reach [[Montevideo]] but succeeded in establishing an alliance with the locals.

On May 8, 1827 Baron Damas, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Sebasti\u00e1n Camacho, a Mexican diplomat, signed an agreement called \"The Declarations\" which contained provisions regarding commerce and navigation between France and Mexico.

However, the constant state of warfare left Mexico with a tremendous amount of debt owed to Spain, England, and France, all of whom funded the Mexican war effort (Neeno). As newly appointed president, Benito Ju\u00e1rez suspended payment of debts for next two years, to focus on a rebuilding and stabilization initiative in Mexico under the new government. On December 8, 1861, Spain, England and France landed in Veracruz in order to seize unpaid debts from Mexico. However, Napoleon III, with intentions of establishing a French client state to further push his economic interests, pressured the other two powers to withdraw in 1862 (Greenspan; \"French Intervention in Mexico\u2026\").\n[[File:Batalla de Puebla.png|upright=0.80|thumb|right|Painting depicting the [[Battle of Puebla]] in 1862]]\nFrance under Napoleon III remained and established Maximilian of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|title=French Intervention in Mexico and the American Civil War, 1862\u20131867|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/french-intervention |website=U.S Department of State Office of the Historian}}</ref> The march by the French to Mexico City enticed heavy resistance by the Mexican government, it resulted in open warfare. The Battle of Puebla in 1862 in particular presented an important turning point in which Ignacio Zaragoza led the Mexican army to victory as they pushed back the French offensive (\"Timeline of the Mexican Revolution\"). The victory came to symbolize Mexico's power and national resolve against foreign occupancy and as a result delayed France's later attack on Mexico City for an entire year (Cinco de Mayo (Mexican History)). With heavy resistance by Mexican rebels and the fear of United States intervention against France, forced Napoleon III to withdraw from Mexico, leaving Maximilian to surrender, where he would be later executed by Mexican troops under the rule of Porfirio D\u00edaz.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ridge Jr.|first1=Michael Allen|title=A country in need of American instruction : The U.S. mission to shape and transform Mexico, 1848\u20131911|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3321&context=etd|website=Iowa Research Online|publisher=University of Iowa}}</ref> Napoleon III's desire to expand France's economic empire influenced the decision to seize territorial domain over the Central American region. The port city of Veracruz, Mexico and France's desire to construct a new canal were of particular interest. Bridging both New World and East Asian trade routes to the Atlantic were key to Napoleon III's economic goals to the mining of precious rocks and the expansion of France's textile industry. Napoleon's fear of the United States' economic influence over the Pacific trade region, and in turn all New World economic activity, pushed France to intervene in Mexico under the pretense of collecting on Mexico's debt. Eventually France began plans to build the Panama Canal in 1881 until 1904 when the United States took over and proceeded with its construction and implementation (\"Read Our Story\").\n\n===American involvement in Latin America during the 19th century===\n\n====Monroe Doctrine====\n[[File:Roosevelt monroe Doctrine cartoon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Political cartoon depicting [[Theodore Roosevelt]] using the [[Monroe Doctrine]] to keep European powers out of the [[Dominican Republic]]]]\nThe [[Monroe Doctrine]] was included in President [[James Monroe]]'s 1823 annual message to Congress. The doctrine warns European nations that the United States will no longer tolerate any new colonization of Latin American countries. It was originally drafted to meet the present major concerns, but eventually became the precept of U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere. The doctrine was put into effect in 1865 when the U.S. government supported Mexican president, [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], diplomatically and militarily. Some Latin American countries viewed the U.S. interventions, allowed by the Monroe Doctrine when the U.S. deems necessary, with suspicion.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. ''A History of Latin America''. pg 491</ref>\n\nAnother important aspect of United States involvement in Latin America is the case of the [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. In 1855, he traveled to Nicaragua hoping to overthrow the government and take the land for the United States. With only the aid of 56 followers, he was able to take over the city of [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]], declaring himself commander of the army and installing [[Patricio Rivas]] as a puppet president. However, Rivas's presidency ended when he fled Nicaragua; Walker rigged the following election to ensure that he became the next president. His presidency did not last long, however, as he was met with much opposition from political groups in Nicaragua and neighbouring countries. On May 1, 1857, Walker was forced by a coalition of Central American armies to surrender himself to a United States Navy officer who repatriated him and his followers. When Walker subsequently returned to Central America in 1860, he was apprehended by the Honduran authorities and executed.\n\n====Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u201348)====\n[[File:Mexico nebel.jpg|thumb|left|American occupation of [[Mexico City]]]]\n\nThe [[Mexican\u2013American War]], another instance of U.S. involvement in Latin America, was a war between the United States and Mexico that started in April 1846 and lasted until February 1848. The main cause of the war was the United States' annexation of Texas in 1845 and a dispute afterwards about whether the border between Mexico and the United States ended where Mexico claimed, at the [[Nueces River]], or ended where the United States claimed, at the [[Rio Grande]]. Peace was negotiated between the United States and Mexico with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which stated that Mexico was to cede land which would later become part of California and New Mexico as well as give up all claims to Texas, for which the United States would pay $15,000,000. However, tensions between the two countries were still high and over the next six years things only got worse with raids along the border and attacks by Native Americans against Mexican citizens. To defuse the situation, the United States agreed to purchase 29,670 squares miles of land from Mexico for $10,000,000 so a southern railroad could be built to connect the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. This would become known as the [[Gadsden Purchase]]. A critical component of U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs took form in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], which drastically affected the futures of Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Americas, as well as Guam and the Philippines, by dismantling some of the last remaining Spanish colonial possessions throughout the world.\n\n==From the \"Big Stick\" to the \"Good Neighbor\" policy==\n[[File:Satterfield cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic.jpg|thumb|[[Bob Satterfield (cartoonist)|Bob Satterfield]] cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic]]\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the U.S. banana importing companies [[United Fruit Company]], [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]] (both ancestors of [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]]), and [[Standard Fruit Company]] (now [[Dole Food Company|Dole]]), acquired large amounts of land in Central American countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica. The companies gained leverage over the governments and a ruling elite in these countries by dominating their economies and paying kickbacks, and exploited local workers.

The 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War]] resulted in the end of Spanish colonial presence in the Americas. A period of frequent U.S. intervention in Latin America followed, with the acquisition of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] in 1903, the so-called [[Banana Wars]] in Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Honduras; the [[Caco Wars]] in Haiti; and the so-called [[Border War (1910\u20131919)|Border War]] with Mexico.

The proposal was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence. The revelation of the contents outraged the American public and swayed public opinion. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] moved to arm American merchant ships in order to defend themselves against German submarines, which had started to attack them. The news helped generate support for the [[American entry into World War I|United States declaration of war on Germany]] in April of that year.<ref>[[#Andrew|Andrew]], p.&nbsp;42.</ref>\n\nThe message came as a [[code (cryptography)|coded]] telegram dispatched by the Foreign Secretary of the German Empire, [[Arthur Zimmermann]], on January 16, 1917. The message was sent to the German ambassador of Mexico, [[Heinrich von Eckardt]]. Zimmermann sent the telegram in anticipation of the [[Atlantic U-boat campaign of World War I#1917: Renewed \"unrestricted\" campaign|resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare]] by Germany on 1 February, an act which Germany presumed would lead to war. The telegram instructed Ambassador Eckardt that if the U.S. appeared certain to enter the war, he was to approach the Mexican Government with a proposal for a military alliance, with funding from Germany. As part of the alliance, Germany would assist Mexico in reconquering Texas and the Southwest. Eckardt was instructed to urge Mexico to help broker an alliance between Germany and Japan. Mexico, in the middle of the [[Mexican Revolution]], far weaker militarily, economically and politically than the U.S., ignored the proposal; after the U.S. entered the war, it officially rejected it.\n\n====Brazil's participation in World War II====\nAfter World War I, in which Brazil was an ally of the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], and [[France]], the country realized it needed a more capable army but did not have the technology to create it. In 1919, the French Military Mission was established by the French Commission in Brazil. Their main goal was to contain the inner rebellions in Brazil. They tried to assist the army by bringing them up to the European military standard but constant civil missions did not prepare them for [[World War II]].\n\nBrazil's President, [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], wanted to industrialize Brazil, allowing it to be more competitive with other countries. He reached out to Germany, Italy, France, and the United States to act as trade allies. Many Italian and German people immigrated to Brazil many years before World War II began thus creating a Nazi influence. The immigrants held high positions in government and the armed forces. It was recently found that 9,000 war criminals escaped to South America, including Croats, Ukrainians, Russians and other western Europeans who aided the Nazi war machine. Most, perhaps as many as 5,000, went to Argentina; between 1,500 and 2,000 are thought to have made it to Brazil; around 500 to 1,000 to Chile; and the rest to Paraguay and Uruguay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Secret Files Reveal 9,000 Nazi War Criminals Fled to South America after WWII|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2117093/Secret-files-reveal-9-000-Nazi-war-criminals-fled-South-America-WWII.html|newspaper=Mail Online|accessdate=24 May 2012|location=London|first=Allan|last=Hall|date=2012-03-19}}</ref> It was not a secret that Vargas had an admiration for Hitler's Nazi Germany and its F\u00fchrer. He even let German Luftwaffe build secret air forces around Brazil.\nThis alliance with Germany became Brazil's second best trade alliance behind the United States.\n\n[[File:Massarosaw.jpg|right|thumb|Brazilian soldiers greet Italian civilians in the city of [[Massarosa]], September 1944. Brazil was the only independent Latin American country to send ground troops to fight in WWII.]]\n\nBrazil continued to try to remain neutral to the United States and Germany because it was trying to make sure it could continue to be a place of interest for both opposing countries. Brazil attended continental meetings in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1936); Lima, Peru (1938); and Havana, Cuba (1940) that obligated them to agree to defend any part of the Americas if they were to be attacked. Eventually, Brazil decided to stop trading with Germany once Germany started attacking offshore trading ships resulting in Germany declaring a blockade against the Americas in the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, Germany also ensured that they would be attacking the Americas soon.\n\nOnce the German submarines attacked unarmed Brazilian trading ships, President Vargas met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt to discuss how they could retaliate. On January 22, 1942, Brazil officially ended all relations with Germany, Japan, and Italy, becoming a part of the Allies.\n\nThe [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] was sent to Naples, Italy to fight for democracy. Brazil was the only Latin American country to send troops to Europe. Initially, Brazil wanted to only provide resources and shelter for the war to have a chance of gaining a high postwar status but ended up sending 25,000 men to fight.<ref>{{cite web|last=Penteado|first=Carlos Joes A.|title=Hyper War: The Brazilian Participation in World War II|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/Brazil/Participation/index.html|accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, the United States and Latin America continued to have a close relationship.

The two world wars and U.S. Depression also made Latin American countries favor internal economic development, leading Latin America to adopt the policy of [[import substitution industrialization]].<ref name=\"History of Latin America\">{{cite web|title=History of Latin America|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> Countries also renewed emphasis on exports. Brazil began selling automobiles to other countries, and some Latin American countries set up plants to assemble imported parts, letting other countries take advantage of Latin America's low labor costs. Colombia began to export flowers, emeralds and coffee grains and gold, becoming the world's second-leading flower exporter.\n\nEconomic integration was called for, to attain economies that could compete with the economies of the United States or Europe. Starting in the 1960s with the Latin American Free Trade Association and Central American Common Market, Latin American countries worked toward economic integration.\n\nIn efforts to help regain global economic strength, the U.S. began to heavily assist countries involved in World War II at the expense of Latin America. Markets that were previously unopposed as a result of the war in Latin America grew stagnant as the rest of the world no longer needed their goods.\n\n====Reforms====\nLarge countries like Argentina called for reforms to lessen the disparity of wealth between the rich and the poor, which has been a long problem in Latin America that stunted economic growth.<ref name=\"Kaufman\">{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Robert|title=The Political Effects of Inequality: Some Inconvenient Facts|publisher=Rutgers University}}</ref>\n\nAdvances in public health caused an explosion of population growth, making it difficult to provide social services. Education expanded, and social security systems introduced, but benefits usually went to the middle class, not the poor. As a result, the disparity of wealth increased. Increasing inflation and other factors caused countries to be unwilling to fund social development programs to help the poor.\n\n====Bureaucratic authoritarianism====\nBureaucratic authoritarianism was practised in Brazil after 1964, in Argentina, and in Chile under Augusto Pinochet, in a response to harsh economic conditions. It rested on the conviction that no democracy could take the harsh measures to curb inflation, reassure investors, and quicken economic growth quickly and effectively. Though inflation fell sharply, industrial production dropped with the decline of official protection.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n\n====US relations====\n{{see also|Latin America\u2013United States relations|Foreign interventions by the United States|United States involvement in regime change in Latin America}}\n[[File:Reuni\u00f3n Pinochet - Kissinger.jpg|thumb|Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] shaking hands with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1976]]\nAfter [[World War II]] and the beginning of a [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], US diplomats became interested in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and Latin America, and frequently{{vague|date=June 2014}} waged proxy wars against the Soviet Union in these countries.

The United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba, and combined with Castro's expropriation of private enterprises, this was detrimental to the Cuban economy.<ref name=\"History of Latin America\" /> Around Latin America, rural guerrilla conflict and urban terrorism increased, inspired by the Cuban example. The United States put down these rebellions by supporting Latin American countries in their counter-guerrilla operations through the Alliance for Progress launched by President John F. Kennedy. This thrust appeared to be successful. A Marxist, Salvador Allende, became president of Chile in 1970, but was overthrown three years later in a military coup backed by the United States. Despite civil war, high crime and political instability, most Latin American countries eventually adopted bourgeois liberal democracies while Cuba maintained its socialist system.\n\n====Bay of Pigs Invasion====\n{{Main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}\n\n[[Image:Attack near Playa Giron.

The incident proved to be very embarrassing for the new Kennedy administration.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Bay of Pigs Invasion|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nThe failure of the invasion led to a [[Cuba\u2013Soviet Union relations|Soviet-Cuban alliance]].\n\n====Cuban Missile Crisis====\n{{Main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}\nIn 1962, Cuba threatened the USA when it allowed Soviet missiles to be placed on the island, just 90 miles away from Florida; Cuba saw it as a way to defend the island, while the Americans saw it as a threat. The ensuing Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014the closest the world has ever come to total annihilation\u2014almost saw a US invasion or bombing of Cuba, but it ended when the two sides agreed on the removal of missiles; the US removed theirs from Italy and Turkey, while the Soviets removed theirs from Cuba. The crisis' end left Cuba blockaded by the US, which was also obligated to not invade Cuba. In fact, they were allowed to keep [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] as a naval base as per an agreement with the previous government of Batista.\n\n====Alliance for Progress====\nPresident John F. Kennedy initiated the [[Alliance for Progress]] in 1961, to establish economic cooperation between the U.S. and Latin America. The Alliance would provide $20 billion for reform in Latin America, and counterinsurgency measures. Instead, the reform failed because of the simplistic theory that guided it and the lack of experienced American experts who could understand Latin American customs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kennedy proposes Alliance for Progress - Mar 13, 1961 - HISTORY.com|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/kennedy-proposes-alliance-for-progress|website=HISTORY|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Foreign interventions by Cuba====\n{{Main|Foreign interventions by Cuba}}\n[[File:Cuban PT-76 Angola.JPG|thumb|A Cuban [[PT-76]] performing routine security duties in [[Angola]] during the [[Cuban intervention in Angola|Cuban intervention into the country]]]]\n[[File:Cubans in Ogaden1.JPG|thumb|Cuban artillerymen in [[Ethiopia]] during the [[Ogaden War]]]]\nArmed Cuban intervention overseas began on 14 June 1959 with an invasion of the Dominican Republic<ref name=CIA/> by a group of fifty-six men, who landed a [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar|C-56]] transport aircraft at the military airport of the town of Constanza. Upon their landing, the fifteen-man Dominican garrison began an ongoing gun battle with the invaders, until the survivors disappeared into the surrounding mountains.

The era of Somoza family rule was characterized by strong U.S. support for the government and its military as well as a heavy reliance on U.S.-based multi-national corporations. The Nicaraguan Revolution (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n Nicarag\u00fcense or Revoluci\u00f3n Popular Sandinista) encompassed the rising opposition to the Somoza dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s, the campaign led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) to violently oust the dictatorship in 1978\u201379, the subsequent efforts of the FSLN to govern Nicaragua from 1979 until 1990 and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Contra War]] which was waged between the FSLN and the [[Contras]] from 1981\u20131990.\n\nThe Revolution marked a significant period in Nicaraguan history and revealed the country as one of the major proxy war battlegrounds of the Cold War with the events in the country rising to international attention. Although the initial overthrow of the Somoza regime in 1978\u201379 was a bloody affair, the Contra War of the 1980s took the lives of tens of thousands of Nicaraguans and was the subject of fierce international debate.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. A history of Latin America. pg541-542</ref> During the 1980s both the FSLN (a leftist collection of political parties) and the Contras (a rightist collection of counter-revolutionary groups) received large amounts of aid from the Cold War super-powers (respectively, the Soviet Union and the United States).\n\n===Washington Consensus===\n{{Main|Washington Consensus}}\n{{See also|Free Trade Area of the Americas}}\n[[File:Ship passing through Panama Canal 01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roll-on/roll-off]]\nships, such as this one pictured here at [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores locks]], are among the largest ships to pass through the [[Panama Canal]].

(Other Latin countries with governments of the left, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Peru, have in practice adopted the bulk of the policies.) Also critical of the policies as actually promoted by the International Monetary Fund have been some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], who have challenged what are sometimes described as the \"fundamentalist\" policies of the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury for what Stiglitz calls a \"one size fits all\" treatment of individual economies.\n\nThe term has become associated with neoliberal policies in general and drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the free market, constraints upon the state, and US influence on other countries' national sovereignty.\n\nThis politico-economical initiative was institutionalized in North America by 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], and elsewhere in the Americas through a series of [[Free Trade Area of the Americas#Agreements|like agreements]]. The comprehensive [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] project, however, was rejected by most [[Mercosur|South American countries]] at the 2005 [[4th Summit of the Americas]].\n\n===Turn to the left===\n{{See also|Pink tide}}\n[[File:UNASUR-15SEP2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[UNASUR]] summit in the Palacio de la Moneda, Santiago de Chile]]\nIn most countries, since the 2000s left-wing political parties have risen to power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The presidencies of [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] in Venezuela, [[Ricardo Lagos]] and [[Michelle Bachelet]] in Chile, [[Lula da Silva]] and [[Dilma Rousseff]] in Brazil, [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and his wife [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner|Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]] in Argentina, [[Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mujica]] in Uruguay, [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador, [[Fernando Lugo]] in Paraguay, [[Manuel Zelaya]] in [[Honduras]] (removed from power by a [[2009 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]), [[Mauricio Funes]] and [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]] in El Salvador are all part of this wave of [[left-wing]] politicians who often declare themselves [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Latin American integration|Latin Americanists]], or [[Anti-Imperialism|anti-imperialists]] (often implying [[Anti-Americanism#Latin America|opposition to US]] [[Washington consensus|policies towards the region]]). A development of this has been the creation of the eight-member ALBA alliance, or \"[[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America]]\" (Spanish: ''Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra Am\u00e9rica'') by some of the countries already mentioned.

A \"reversal of development\" reigned over Latin America, seen through negative economic growth, declines in industrial production, and thus, falling living standards for the middle and lower classes.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Escobar|editor-first=Arturo|editor-first2=Sonia E.|editor-last2=Alvarez|title=The Making of Social Movements in Latin America|location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Westview|date=1992}}</ref> Governments made financial security their primary policy goal over social security, enacting new neoliberal economic policies that implemented privatization of previously national industries and [[Informal sector|informalization]] of labor.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\" /> In an effort to bring more investors to these industries, these governments also embraced [[globalization]] through more open interactions with the international economy.\n\nSignificantly, as democracy spread across much of Latin America, the realm of government became more inclusive (a trend that proved conducive to social movements), the economic ventures remained exclusive to a few elite groups within society. Neoliberal restructuring consistently redistributed income upward while denying political responsibility to provide social welfare rights, and though [[Development studies|development]] projects took place throughout the region, both inequality and poverty increased.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\" /> Feeling excluded from these new projects, the lower classes took ownership of their own democracy through a revitalization of social movements in Latin America.\n\nBoth urban and rural populations had serious grievances as a result of the above economic and global trends and have voiced them in mass demonstrations. Some of the largest and most violent of these have been protests against cuts in urban services, such as the [[Caracazo]] in Venezuela and the [[Argentinazo]] in Argentina.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\">Johnston, Hank, and Paul Almeida, eds.

These movements have benefited considerably from transnational support from conservationists and [[International nongovernmental organizations|INGOs]]. The [[Landless Workers' Movement|Movement of Rural Landless Workers]] (MST) is perhaps the largest contemporary Latin American social movement.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" /> As indigenous populations are primarily rural, indigenous movements account for a large portion of rural social movements, including the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista rebellion]] in Mexico, the [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] ([[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador|CONAIE]]), indigenous organizations in the Amazon region of Ecuador and Bolivia, pan-Mayan communities in Guatemala, and mobilization by the indigenous groups of [[Yanomami]] peoples in the Amazon, [[Guna people|Kuna]] peoples in Panama, and Altiplano [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples in Bolivia.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" /> Other significant types of social movements include labor struggles and strikes, such as [[recovered factories]] in Argentina, as well as gender-based movements such as the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] in Argentina and protests against [[maquila]] production, which is largely a women's issue because of how it draws on women for cheap labor.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" />\n\n===Modern era===\nThe [[2000s commodities boom]] caused positive effects for many Latin American economies.

In the Spanish and Portuguese empires, racial mixing or miscegenation was the norm and something that the Spanish and Portuguese had grown rather accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans in the Iberian peninsula. But, demographics may have made this inevitable as well. Thus, for example, of the approximately 13.5 million people who lived in the Spanish colonies in 1800 before independence only about one fifth were white. This contrasts with the U.S., where more than four fifths were whites (out of a population of 5.3 million in 1801, 900,000 were slaves, plus approximately 60,000 free blacks). ...\n\nThe fact of the recognition of a racial continuum in Hispanic American (sic) does not mean that there wasn't discrimination, which there was, or that there wasn't an obsession with race, or 'castes', as they were sometimes called. ...\n\nIn areas with large indigenous Amerindian populations, a racial mixture resulted, which is known in Spanish as ''mestizos'' ... who are a majority in Mexico, Central America and most of South America. Similarly, when African slaves were brought to the Caribbean region and Brazil, where there was very little indigenous presence left, unions between them and Spanish produced a population of mixed ''mulatos'' ... who are a majority of the population in many of those Spanish-speaking Caribbean basin countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Venezuela). \n}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/race.htm|title=Hispanics and Race|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>\n\nAske has also written that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Spanish colonization was rather different from later English, or British, colonization of North America. They had different '''systems of colonization''' and different methods of subjugation. While the English were primarily interested in grabbing land, the Spanish in addition had a mandate to incorporate the land's inhabitants into their society, something which was achieved by religious conversion and sexual unions which produced a new 'race' of ''mestizos'', a mixture of Europeans and indigenous peoples. ''mestizos'' (sic) form the majority of the population in Mexico, Central America, and much of South America. Racial mixing or miscegenation, after all, was something that the Spanish and Portuguese had been accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans.\n\nSimilarly, later on, when African slaves were introduced into the Caribbean basin region, unions between them and Spaniards produced a population of ''mulatos'', who are a majority of the population in the Caribbean islands (the Antilles) (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico), as well as other areas of the Caribbean region (Colombia, Venezuela and parts of the Central American Caribbean coast). ''mestizos'' (sic) and ''mulatos'' may not have always have been first class citizens in their countries, but they were never disowned in the way the outcomes of unions of Europeans and Native Americans were in the British colonies, where interracial marriages were taboo and one drop of Black or Amerindian blood was enough to make the person 'impure'. \n}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/history.htm|title=Some historical background|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>\n\nIn his famous 1963 book ''[[The Rise of the West]]'', [[William Hardy McNeill]] wrote that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Racially mixed societies arose in most of Spanish and Portuguese America, compounded in varying proportions from European, Indian, and Negro strands. Fairly frequent resort to manumission mitigated the hardships of slavery in those areas; and the Catholic church positively encouraged marriages between white immigrants and Indian women as a remedy for sexual immorality. However, in the southern English colonies and in most of the Caribbean islands, the importation of Negro slaves created a much more sharply polarized biracial society. Strong race feeling and the servile status of nearly all Negroes interdicted intermarriage, practically if not legally. Such discrimination did not prevent interbreeding; but children of mixed parentage were assigned to the status of their mothers. Mulattoes and Indian half-breeds were thereby excluded from the white community. In Spanish (and, with some differences, Portuguese) territories a more elaborate and less oppressive principle of racial discrimination established itself. The handful of persons who had been born in the homelands claimed topmost social prestige; next came those of purely European descent; while beneath ranged the various racial blends to form a social pyramid whose numerous racial distinctions meant that no one barrier could become as ugly and inpenetrable as that dividing whites from Negroes in the English, Dutch, and French colonies.\n}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community|last=McNeill|first=William H.|year=1991|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}, p. 603</ref>\n\nThomas C. Wright, meanwhile, has written that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=The demographic makeup of colonial Latin America became more complex when, as the native population declined, the Portuguese, Spanish, and the French in Haiti turned to Africa for labor, as did the British in North America. The tricontinental heritage that characterizes Latin America, then, is shared by the United States, but even a casual examination reveals that the outcome of the complex interaction of different peoples has varied. While miscegenation among the three races certainly occurred in North America, it appears to have been much less common than in Latin America. Furthermore, offspring of such liaisons were not recognized as belonging to new, distinct racial categories in North America as they were in Latin America. The terms mestizo or ''mameluco'', mulatto, the general term ''castas'', and dozens of subcategories of racial identity frankly recognized the outcomes of interracial sexual activity in Latin America and established a continuum of race rather than the unrealistic absolute categories of white, black, or Indian as used in the United States.

Spanish in green, Portuguese in orange, and French in blue.]]\n\n[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the predominant language of Latin America. It is spoken as first language by about 60% of the population. Portuguese is spoken by about 34%, and about 6% speak other languages such as Quechua, [[Mayan languages]], Guaran\u00ed, Aymara, Nahuatl, English, French, Dutch and Italian. Portuguese is spoken only in Brazil ([[Brazilian Portuguese]]), the biggest and most populous country in the region. Spanish is the official language of most of the rest of the countries and territories on the Latin American mainland ([[Spanish language in the Americas]]), as well as in [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] (where it is co-official with English), and the [[Dominican Republic]]. [[French language|French]] is spoken in [[Haiti]] and in the French [[overseas department]]s of [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]] and [[French Guiana|Guiana]], and the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]; it is also spoken by some Panamanians of Afro-Antillean descent. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language in [[Suriname]], [[Aruba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. (As Dutch is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], these territories are not necessarily considered part of Latin America.) However, the native language of Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and Cura\u00e7ao, is [[Papiamento]], a creole language largely based on Portuguese and Spanish and has a considerable influence coming from the Dutch language and [[Portuguese-based creole languages]].\n\n[[File:Map-Most Widely Spoken Native Languages in Latin America.png|thumb|'''{{color|blue|Quechua}}''', '''{{background color|black|{{color|#f9dc38|Guaran\u00ed}}}}''', '''{{background color|black|{{color|#ff9922|Aymara}}}}''', '''{{color|#cc0000|N\u00e1huatl}}''', '''{{color|#006600|Lenguas Mayas}}''', '''Mapudungun''']]\n\n[[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian languages]] are widely spoken in [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Mexico]], and to a lesser degree, in [[Panama]], [[Ecuador]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]] amongst other countries. In Latin American countries not named above, the population of speakers of indigenous languages tend to be very small or even non-existent (e.g. [[Uruguay]]). Mexico is possibly the only country that contains a wider variety of indigenous languages than any Latin American country, but the most spoken language is Nahuatl.\n\nIn [[Peru]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] is an official language, alongside Spanish and any other indigenous language in the areas where they predominate. In [[Ecuador]], while holding no official status, the closely related [[Quichua]] is a recognized language of the indigenous people under the country's constitution; however, it is only spoken by a few groups in the country's highlands. In [[Bolivia]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], Quechua and Guaran\u00ed hold official status alongside Spanish. [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]], along with Spanish, is an official language of [[Paraguay]], and is spoken by a majority of the population (who are, for the most part, bilingual), and it is co-official with Spanish in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] province of [[Corrientes]]. In [[Nicaragua]], Spanish is the official language, but on the country's Caribbean coast English and indigenous languages such as [[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Sumo languages|Sumo]], and [[Rama language|Rama]] also hold official status. [[Colombia]] recognizes all indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official, though fewer than 1% of its population are native speakers of these languages. [[Nahuatl]] is one of the 62 native languages spoken by indigenous people in Mexico, which are officially recognized by the government as \"national languages\" along with Spanish.\n\nOther European languages spoken in Latin America include: [[English language|English]], by some groups in [[Puerto Rico]], as well as in nearby countries that may or may not be considered Latin American, like [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]], and spoken by descendants of British settlers in Argentina & Chile; [[German language|German]], in southern [[Brazil]], southern [[Chile]], portions of [[Argentina]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Paraguay]]; [[Italian language|Italian]], in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and [[Uruguay]]; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] in southern Brazil and Argentina; and [[Welsh language|Welsh]], in southern Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1163503 |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1stclassargentina.com/tours/WelshImmigration.html|title=The Welsh Immigration to Argentina|work=1stclassargentina.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy Howat |url=http://www.argbrit.org/Patagonia/patagonia_entry.htm |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Argbrit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.patagonline.com/patagonia/destacados/peninsula-valdes/gaiman-trelew |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Patagonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andesceltig.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Andesceltig.com |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2013-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917174822/http://andesceltig.com/ |archive-date=2017-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glaniad.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Glaniad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808130811/http://www.glaniad.com/ |archive-date=2016-08-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] are possible to be heard around Buenos Aires and S\u00e3o Paulo especially.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html#4 |title=Brazil \u2013 Modern-Day Community |publisher=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref> Non-European or Asian languages include [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay, [[Korean language|Korean]] in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile, and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] throughout South America.\n\nIn several nations, especially in the Caribbean region, [[creole languages]] are spoken.

A report released in 2013 by the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] entitled ''Inequality Matters.

Minor blocs or trade agreements are the [[G3 Free Trade Agreement]], the [[Dominican Republic \u2013 Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (DR-CAFTA), the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) and the [[Andean Community of Nations]] (CAN). However, major reconfigurations are taking place along opposing approaches to integration and trade; Venezuela has officially withdrawn from both the CAN and G3 and it has been formally admitted into the Mercosur (pending ratification from the Paraguayan legislature). The president-elect of Ecuador has manifested his intentions of following the same path. This bloc nominally opposes any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, although Uruguay has manifested its intention otherwise.

It is the product of many diverse influences:\n\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] cultures of the people who inhabited the continent prior to European Colonization. Ancient and very advanced civilizations developed their own political, social and religious systems. The [[Maya civilization|Mayas]], the [[Aztec]]s and the [[Inca civilization|Incas]] are examples of these. Indigenous legacies in music, dance, foods, arts and crafts, clothing, folk culture and traditions are very strong in Latin America. Linguistic effects on [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are also marked, such as in terms like [[pampa]], [[taco]], [[tamale]], [[cacique]].\n* [[Western culture|Western civilization]], in particular the [[culture of Europe]], was brought mainly by the colonial powers{{spaced ndash}}the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[French people|French]]{{spaced ndash}}between the 16th and 19th centuries. The most enduring European colonial influence is language and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. More recently, additional cultural influences came from the United States and Europe during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, due to the growing influence of the former on the world stage and immigration from the latter. The influence of the United States is particularly strong in northern Latin America, especially Puerto Rico, which is an American territory. Prior to 1959, Cuba, who fought for its independence along American soldiers in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], was also known to have a close socioeconomic relation with the United States. In addition, the United States also helped Panama become an independent state from Colombia and built the twenty-mile-long [[Panama Canal Zone]] in Panama which held from 1903 (the [[Panama Canal]] opened to transoceanic freight traffic in 1914) to 1999, when the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]] restored Panamanian control of the Canal Zone. South America experienced waves of immigration of Europeans, especially Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Germans, Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Russians, Croatians, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews. With the end of colonialism, [[Culture of France|French culture]] was also able to exert a direct influence in Latin America, especially in the realms of [[high culture]], science and medicine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stepan|first=Nancy Leys |title=\"The Hour of Eugenics\": Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |location=Ithaca |pages=in passim |nopp=true |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NuUxkMC1ePYC |isbn=978-0-8014-9795-7}}</ref> This can be seen in any expression of the region's artistic traditions, including painting, literature and music, and in the realms of science and politics. \nDue to the impact of Enlightenment ideals after the French revolution, a certain number of Iberian-American countries decriminalized homosexuality after France and French territories in the Americas in 1791. Some of the countries that abolished sodomy laws or banned any reference to state interference in consensual adult sexuality in the 19th century were Dominican Republic (1822), Brazil (1824), Peru (1836), Mexico (1871), Paraguay (1880), Argentina (1887), Honduras (1899), Guatemala and El Salvador. Today same-sex marriage is legal in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Uruguay, and French overseas departments, as well as in several states of Mexico. Civil unions can be held in Chile.\n\n* [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]], whose presence derives from a long history of [[Atlantic slave trade|New World slavery]]. Peoples of African descent have influenced the ethno-scapes of Latin America and the Caribbean. This is manifested for instance in music, dance and religion, especially in countries like Brazil, Uruguay, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Haiti, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Cuba.\n* [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]], whose part of the presence derives from the long history of the [[Coolie|Coolie trade]] mostly arriving during the 19th and 20th centuries, and most commonly Chinese workers in Peru and Venezuela.

In general, this artistic Eurocentrism began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge the uniqueness of their condition and started to follow their own path.\n\n[[File:Santiago Martinez Delgado in the colombian congress.jpg|thumb|right|Mural by [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] in the [[Colombian Congress]]]]\n\nFrom the early twentieth century, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Barreiro |first=Gabriel|date=December 1994|title=Constructivism in Latin America |journal=University of Essex Collection of Latin American Art|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The Movement quickly spread from Russia to Europe and then into Latin America.

Historically, the main centers of production have been Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba.  Latin American film flourished after sound was introduced in cinema, which added a linguistic barrier to the export of Hollywood film south of the border.<ref>Paul A. Schroeder Rodriguez. ''Latin American Cinema: A Comparative History'' (University of California Press; 2016) studies 50 films since the silent era.</ref>\n[[File:Alejandro Inarritu Cannes 2017.jpg|right|upright|thumb|In 2015, [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] became the second Mexican director in a row to win both the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award]] and the [[Directors Guild of America Award]] for Best Director. He won his second [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 2016 for ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]''.]]\n\n[[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]] started out in the silent era from 1896 to 1929 and flourished in the [[Golden age of the cinema of Mexico|Golden Era]] of the 1940s. It boasted a huge industry comparable to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] at the time with stars such as [[Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], and [[Pedro Infante]]. In the 1970s, <!-- and 1970s --> Mexico was the location for many cult horror and action movies. More recently, films such as ''[[Amores Perros]]'' (2000) and ''[[Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n]]'' (2001) enjoyed box office and critical acclaim and propelled [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] and [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] to the front rank of Hollywood directors. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu directed in 2010 ''[[Biutiful]]'' and [[Birdman (film)|''Birdman'']] (2014), Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n directed ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013).  Close friend of both, [[Guillermo del Toro]], a top rank Hollywood director in Hollywood and Spain, directed ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' (2006) and produced ''[[The Orphanage (2007 film)|El Orfanato]]'' (2007). [[Carlos Carrera]] (''[[The Crime of Father Amaro (film)|The Crime of Father Amaro]])'', and screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] are also some of the most known present-day Mexican film makers. ''[[Rudo y Cursi]]'' released in December (2008) in Mexico was directed by [[Carlos Cuar\u00f3n]].\n[[File:Cristina, elenco y Oscar.jpg|left|thumb|President [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]] with the film director [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella]] and the cast of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009) with the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film]]]]\n\n[[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine cinema]] has also been prominenent since the first half of the 20th century and today averages over 60 full-length titles yearly. The industry suffered during the [[Proceso de Reorganizaci\u00f3n Nacional|1976\u20131983 military dictatorship]]; but re-emerged to produce the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[The Official Story]]'' in 1985. A wave of imported U.S. films again damaged the industry in the early 1990s, though it soon recovered, thriving even during the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|Argentine economic crisis]] around 2001. Many Argentine movies produced during recent years have been internationally acclaimed, including ''[[Nueve reinas]]'' (2000), ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (2001), ''[[El abrazo partido]]'' (2004), ''[[El otro]]'' (2007), the 2010 Foreign Language [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[El secreto de sus ojos]]'' and ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (2014).\n\n[[Cinema of Brazil|In Brazil]], the ''[[Cinema Novo]]'' movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays, a clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors in a tropical landscape, and a political message. The modern Brazilian film industry has become more profitable inside the country, and some of its productions have received prizes and recognition in Europe and the United States, with movies such as ''[[Central do Brasil (film)|Central do Brasil]]'' (1999), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|Cidade de Deus]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tropa de Elite]]'' (2007).\n\n[[Cinema of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican cinema]] has produced some notable films, such as ''[[Una Aventura Llamada Menudo]]'', ''[[Los Diaz de Doris]]'' and ''[[Casi Casi]]''. An influx of Hollywood films affected the local film industry in Puerto Rico during the 1980s and 1990s, but several Puerto Rican films have been produced since and it has been recovering.\n\n[[Cinema of Cuba|Cuban cinema]] has enjoyed much official support since the [[Cuban revolution]] and important film-makers include [[Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Latin American literature}}\n{{See also|List of Latin American writers}}\n\n[[File:Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1772).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] in 1772 by Andr\u00e9s de Islas]]\n[[File:Jorge Luis Borges Hotel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Argentine [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in [[L'H\u00f4tel]], [[Paris]] in 1969]]\n\nPre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate [[Aztec codices|codices]]. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the [[Popol Vuh]]. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]-speaking population of Peru and the [[K'iche' people|Quich\u00e9 (K'iche')]] of Guatemala.\n\nFrom the very moment of Europe's discovery of the continents, early explorers and [[conquistadores]] produced written accounts and cr\u00f3nicas of their experience{{spaced ndash}}such as [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s letters or [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]]'s description of the conquest of Mexico. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, within which context [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Towards the end of the 18th Century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive [[Criollo (people)|criollo]] literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as Lizardi's ''[[El Periquillo Sarniento]]'' (1816).\n\nThe 19th century was a period of \"foundational fictions\" (in critic Doris Sommer's words), novels in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focussed on the indigenous question or the dichotomy of \"civilization or barbarism\" (for which see, say, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Domingo Sarmiento]]'s ''[[Facundo]]'' (1845), [[Juan Le\u00f3n Mera]]'s ''Cumand\u00e1'' (1879), or [[Euclides da Cunha]]'s ''[[Os Sert\u00f5es]]'' (1902)). The 19th century also witnessed the realist work of [[Machado de Assis]], who made use of surreal devices of metaphor and playful narrative construction, much admired by critic [[Harold Bloom]].\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, ''[[modernismo]]'' emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]]'s ''Azul'' (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]], for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.\n\n[[File:Gabriela Mistral-01.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Chilean poet [[Gabriela Mistral]], first Latin American to win a [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], in 1945]]\n[[File:Gabogarciamarquez1.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] signing a copy of ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'']]\n\nHowever, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary [[Latin American Boom|boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort\u00e1zar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude|Cien a\u00f1os de soledad]]'' (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with [[magic realism]], though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]] do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s monumental ''Yo, el supremo'' (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], and above all [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were also rediscovered.\n\nContemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling [[Paulo Coelho]] and [[Isabel Allende]] to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as [[Diamela Eltit]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[Ricardo Piglia]], or [[Roberto Bola\u00f1o]]. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of [[Testimony#Literature|testimonio]], texts produced in collaboration with [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] subjects such as [[Rigoberta Mench\u00fa]]. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic [[Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is]] and Pedro Lemebel.\n\nThe region boasts six [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize winners]]: in addition to the two Chilean poets [[Gabriela Mistral]] (1945) and [[Pablo Neruda]] (1971), there is also the Guatemalan novelist [[Miguel Angel Asturias]] (1967), the Colombian writer [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] (1982),  the Mexican poet and essayist [[Octavio Paz]] (1990), and the Peruvian novelist [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (2010).\n\n===Music and dance===\n{{See also|Music of Latin America|Latin pop|Latin dance}}\n[[File:Salsa en Cali.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] dancing in [[Cali]], [[Colombia]]]]\n\nLatin America has produced many successful worldwide artists in terms of recorded global music sales.

The first event happened less than a decade before the publication of Bilbao's and Torres Caicedo works: the Invasion of Mexico or, in USA the [[Mexican- American war|Mexican\u2013American War]], after which Mexico lost a third of its territory. The second event, the [[Walker affair]], happened the same year both works were written: the decision by U.S. president [[Franklin Pierce]] to recognize the regime recently established in Nicaragua by American [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] and his band of filibusters who ruled Nicaragua for nearly a year (1856\u201357) and attempted to reinstate slavery there, where it had been already abolished for three decades\n\nIn both Bilbao's and Torres Caicedo's works, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican-American War]] and Walker's expedition to Nicaragua are explicitly mentioned as examples of dangers for the region.  For Bilbao, \"Latin America\" was not a geographical concept, since he excluded Brazil, Paraguay and Mexico.  Both authors also ask for the union of all Latin American countries as the only way to defend their territories against further foreign U.S. interventions. Both rejected also European imperialism, claiming that the return of European countries to non-democratic forms of government was another danger for Latin American countries, and used the same word to describe the state of European politics at the time: \"despotism.\"  Several years later, during the [[French invasion of Mexico]], Bilbao wrote another work, \"Emancipation of the Spirit in America,\" where he asked all Latin American countries to support the Mexican cause against France, and rejected French imperialism in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. He asked Latin American intellectuals to search for their \"intellectual emancipation\" by abandoning all French ideas, claiming that France was: \"Hypocrite, because she [France] calls herself protector of the Latin race just to subject it to her exploitation regime; treacherous, because she speaks of freedom and nationality, when, unable to conquer freedom for herself, she enslaves others instead!\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bilbao |first1=Francisco |title=Emancipaci\u00f3n del esp\u00edritu de Am\u00e9rica |url=http://www.franciscobilbao.cl/1909/article-81905.html |website=Francisco Bilbao Barqu\u00edn, 1823\u20131865, Chile|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> Therefore, as Michel Gobat puts it, the term Latin America itself had an \"anti-imperial genesis,\" and their creators were far from supporting any form of imperialism in the region, or in any other place of the globe.\n\nHowever, in France the term Latin America was used with the opposite intention. It was employed by the French Empire of [[Napoleon III]] during the French invasion of Mexico as a way to include France among countries with influence in the Americas and to exclude [[Anglo America|Anglophone countries]]. It played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area, and install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor of the [[Second Mexican Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Chasteen |first1=John Charles |authorlink1= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |title=Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fC90B5xkYyIC&lpg=PA156&pg=PP1#v=onepage |accessdate=4 July 2010 |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2001 |origyear= |publisher=[[W.

Neither area is culturally or linguistically homogeneous; in substantial portions of Latin America (e.g., highland [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]]), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures and, to a lesser extent, Amerindian languages, are predominant, and in other areas, the influence of African cultures is strong (e.g., the Caribbean basin{{spaced ndash}}including parts of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]).\n\nThe term is not without controversy.  Historian Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo explores at length the \"allure and power\" of the idea of Latin America. He remarks at the outset, \"The idea of 'Latin America' ought to have vanished with the obsolescence of racial theory... But it is not easy to declare something dead when it can hardly be said to have existed,\" going on to say, \"The term is here to stay, and it is important.\"<ref>Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo, ''Latin America: The Allure and Power of an Idea''.

3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Maya Civilization|Mayan]] archeological site [[Chichen Itza]]. ]]\n\nThe earliest known settlement was identified at [[Monte Verde]], near [[Puerto Montt]] in Southern Chile. Its occupation dates to some 14,000 years ago and there is some disputed evidence of even earlier occupation. Over the course of millennia, people spread to all parts of the continents. By the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]], South America's vast rainforests, mountains, plains and coasts were the home of tens of millions of people. The earliest settlements in the Americas are of the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas Culture]]<ref>The preceramic Las Vegas culture of coastal Ecuador https://www.jstor.org/pss/280325</ref> from about 8000&nbsp;BCE and 4600&nbsp;BCE, a sedentary group from the coast of [[Ecuador]], the forefathers of the more known [[Valdivia culture]], of the same era. Some groups formed more permanent settlements such as the [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] (or \"[[Muisca people|Muisca]]\" or \"Muysca\") and the [[Tairona]] groups. These groups are in the circum Caribbean region. The Chibchas of [[Colombia]], the [[Quechuas]] and [[Aymaras]] of [[Bolivia]] were the three indigenous groups that settled most permanently.\n\nThe region was home to many [[indigenous peoples]] and advanced civilizations, including the [[Aztecs]], [[Toltecs]], [[Maya Civilization|Maya]], and [[Inca]]. The [[golden age]] of the Maya began about 250, with the last two great [[civilization]]s, the Aztecs and Incas, emerging into prominence later on in the early fourteenth century and mid-fifteenth centuries, respectively. The Aztec empire was ultimately the most powerful civilization known throughout the Americas, until its downfall in part by the Spanish invasion.\n\n===European colonization===\n{{Main|European colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n{{see also|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\n[[File:Desembarco de Col\u00f3n de Di\u00f3scoro Puebla.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.00|[[Romanticism|Romantic]] painting of Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] arriving to the Americas (''Primer desembarco de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n en Am\u00e9rica''), by [[Di\u00f3scoro Puebla]] (1862)]]\n[[File:Jal-ixco.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|[[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]] leads [[Spain|Spanish]] soldiers with [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]]n allies against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous warriors]] during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|European colonization of the Americas]].]]\n\nWith the arrival of the Europeans following [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages, the indigenous elites, such as the Incas and Aztecs, lost power to the heavy European invasion. [[Hern\u00e1ndo Cort\u00e9s]] seized the Aztec elite's power with the help of local groups who had favored the Aztec elite, and [[Francisco Pizarro]] eliminated the Incan rule in Peru. The European powers of Spain and Portugal colonized the region, which along with the rest of the uncolonized world, was divided into areas of Spanish and Portuguese control by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|line of demarcation]] in 1494, which gave Spain all areas to the west, and Portugal all areas to the east (the Portuguese lands in South America subsequently becoming Brazil). By the end of the sixteenth century Spain and Portugal had been joined by others, including France, in occupying large areas of North, Central and South America, ultimately extending from Alaska to the southern tips of the [[Patagonia]]. European culture, customs and government were introduced, with the Roman Catholic Church becoming the major economic and political power to overrule the traditional ways of the region, eventually becoming the only official religion of the Americas during this period.\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nEpidemics of diseases brought by the Europeans, such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], wiped out a large portion of the indigenous population. Historians cannot determine the number of natives who died due to European diseases, but some put the figures as high as 85% and as low as 25%. Due to the lack of written records, specific numbers are hard to verify. Many of the survivors were forced to work in European plantations and mines. [[Miscegenation|Intermixing]] between the indigenous peoples and the European colonists was very common, and, by the end of the [[Colonialism|colonial period]], people of mixed ancestry ([[mestizo]]s) formed majorities in several colonies.\n\n====Slavery and forced labor in colonial Latin America====\n{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}\n{{see|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries.\n\nThe Mita of Colonial Latin America was a system of forced labor imposed on the natives. First established by Viceroy Francisco de Toledo (1569\u20131581), the Mita was upheld by laws that designated how large draft levies were and how much money the workers would receive that was based on how many shifts each individual worker performed. Toledo established Mitas at Potosi and Huancavelica, where the Mitayos\u2014the workers\u2014would be reduced in number to a fraction of how many were originally assigned before the 1700s. While several villages managed to resist the Mita, others offered payment to colonial administrators as a way out. In exchange, free labor became available through volunteers, though the Mita was kept in place as workers like miners, for example, were paid low wages. The Spanish Crown had not made any ruling on the Mita or approved of it when Toledo first established it in spite of the uncertainty of the practice since the Crown could have gained benefits from it. However, the cortes of Spain later abolished it in 1812 once complaints of the Mita violating humanitarian rights were made. Yet complaints also came from: governors; landowners; native leaders known as Kurakas; and even priests, each of whom preferred other methods of economic exploitation. Despite its fall, the Mita made it to the 1800s.<ref>Brown, K. W. (2008). Mita. In J. Kinsbruner & E. D. Langer (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture (2nd ed., Vol. 4, pp. 635\u2013636). Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons.</ref>\n\nAnother important group of slaves to mention were the slaves brought over from Africa. The first slaves came over with Christopher Columbus from the very beginning on his earliest voyages. However in the few hundred years, the Atlantic Slave trade would begin delivering slaves, imported by Spain and other colonizers, by the millions. Many of the large scale productions were run by forced slave labor. They were a part of sugar and coffee production, farming (beans, rice, corn, fruit, etc.), Mining, whale oil and multiple other jobs. Slaves were also house workers, servants, military soldiers, and much more. To say the least these people were property and treated as such. Though indigenous slaves existed, they were no match in quantity and lack of quality jobs when compared to the African slave. The slave population was massive compared to the better known slave ownership in the United States. After 1860 Brazil alone had imported over 4 million slaves, which only represented about 35% of the Atlantic slave trade. Despite the large number of slaves in Latin America, there was not as much reproduction of slaves amongst the population. Because most of the slaves then were African-born, they were more subject to rebellion. The United States involvement in the slave trade is well known amongst North America, however it hides a larger and in some ways crueler operation in the south which had a much longer history.{{sfnp|Meade|2016|pp=53\u201357}}\n\n===Independence (1804\u20131825)===\n{{Main|Latin American wars of independence|Spanish American wars of independence}}\n[[File:Bolivar Arturo Michelena.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.70|[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], Liberator of [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Panama]]]]\n\nIn 1804, Haiti became the first Latin American nation to gain independence, following a violent slave revolt led by [[Toussaint L'ouverture]] on the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]]. The victors abolished slavery. Haitian independence inspired independence movements in Spanish America.\n[[File:Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla.png|thumbnail|right|upright=0.70|[[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] was the first leader of the [[Mexican War of Independence]].]]\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, Spanish and Portuguese power waned on the global scene as other European powers took their place, notably Britain and France. Resentment grew among the majority of the population in Latin America over the restrictions imposed by the Spanish government, as well as the dominance of native Spaniards (Iberian-born ''[[Peninsulares]]'') in the major social and political [[institution]]s. [[Napoleon]]'s invasion of Spain in 1808 marked a turning point, compelling [[Criollo people|Criollo]] elites to form [[junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]] that advocated independence. Also, the newly independent [[Haiti]], the second oldest nation in the [[New World]] after the United States, further fueled the independence movement by inspiring the leaders of the movement, such as [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] of Mexico, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] of Venezuela and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina, and by providing them with considerable munitions and troops.\n\nFighting soon broke out between juntas and the Spanish colonial authorities, with initial victories for the advocates of independence. Eventually, these early movements were crushed by the [[Royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist troops]] by 1810, including those of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] in [[Mexico]] in the year 1810. Later on [[Francisco de Miranda]] in [[Venezuela]] by 1812. Under the leadership of a new generation of leaders, such as [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] \"The Liberator\", [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina, and other ''[[Libertadores]]'' in South America, the independence movement regained strength, and by 1825, all [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], except for Puerto Rico and Cuba, had gained independence from Spain. In the same year in [[Mexico]], a military officer, [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], led a coalition of conservatives and liberals who created a [[constitutional monarchy]], with Iturbide as [[emperor]]. This [[First Mexican Empire]] was short-lived, and was followed by the creation of a [[republic]] in 1823.\n\n====Independent Empire of Brazil====\n{{Main|Independence of Brazil|Empire of Brazil}}\n[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|left|Declaration of the [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazilian independence]] by the later [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro&nbsp;I]] on September 7, 1822]]\n\nThe [[Brazilian War of Independence]], which had already begun along other independent movements around the region, spread through northern, northeastern regions and in Cisplatina province.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp.&nbsp;168, 164, 178</ref> With the last Portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 March 1824,<ref name=\"Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp. 179\u2013180\">Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp.&nbsp;179\u2013180</ref> Portugal officially recognized Brazil on 29 August 1825.<ref name=\"Lustosa, p. 208\">Lustosa, p.&nbsp;208</ref>\n\n[[File:Pedro Am\u00e9rico - D.

''El liberalismo hispanoamericano'' en el siglo XIX. pg2</ref> Conservatism was the dominant system of government prior to the revolutions and it was founded on having social classes, including governing by kings. Liberalists wanted to see a change in the ruling systems, and to move away from monarchs and social classes in order to promote equality.\n\nWhen liberal [[Guadalupe Victoria]] became the first president of Mexico in 1824, conservatists relied on their belief that the state had been better off before the new government came into power, so, by comparison, the old government was better in the eyes of the Conservatives. Following this sentiment, the conservatives pushed to take control of the government, and they succeeded. [[General Santa Anna]] was elected president in 1833. The following decade, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u201348) caused Mexico to lose a significant amount of territory to the United States. This loss led to a rebellion by the enraged liberal forces against the conservative government.\n\nIn 1837, conservative [[Rafael Carrera]] conquered [[Guatemala]] and separated from the [[Central American Union]]. The instability that followed the disintegration of the union led to the independence of the other Central American countries.\n\nIn [[Brazil]], rural aristocrats were in conflict with the urban conservatives. Portuguese control over Brazilian ports continued after Brazil's independence. Following the conservative idea that the old government was better, urbanites tended to support conservatism because more opportunities were available to them as a result of the Portuguese presence.\n\n[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] became president of [[Gran Colombia]] in 1819 after the region gained independence from Spain. He led a military-controlled state. Citizens did not like the government's position under Bol\u00edvar: The people in the military were unhappy with their roles, and the civilians were of the opinion that the military had too much power. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia, New Grenada continued to have conflicts between conservatives and liberals. These conflicts were each concentrated in particular regions, with conservatives particularly in the southern mountains and the Valley of Cauca. In the mid-1840s some leaders in Caracas organized a liberal opposition. Antonio Leocadio Guzman was an active participant and journalist in this movement and gained much popularity among the people of Caracas.<ref>Halper\u00edn Donghi, T. (2013). ''Historia contempor\u00e1nea de Am\u00e9rica latina''. Madrid: Alianza.</ref>\n\nIn [[Argentina]], the conflict manifested itself as a prolonged civil war between ''[[Unitarian Party|unitarianas]]'' (i.e. ''centralists'') and ''[[Federales|federalists]]'', which were in some aspects respectively analogous to liberals and conservatives in other countries. Between 1832 and 1852, the country existed as a [[Argentine Confederation|confederation]], without a head of state, although the federalist governor of Buenos Aires province, [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], was given the powers of debt payment and international relations and exerted a growing hegemony over the country. A national constitution was only enacted in 1853, reformed in 1860, and the country reorganized as a federal republic led by a [[Generation of '80|liberal-conservative elite]].<ref>Galasso, N. (2011). ''Historia de la Argentina'' (Vol. 1).</ref> After Uruguay achieved its independence, in 1828, a similar polarization crystallized between ''blancos'' and ''colorados'', where the agrarian conservative interests were pitted against the liberal commercial interests based in Montevideo, and which eventually resulted in the ''[[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]]'' civil war (1839\u20131851).<ref>Hudson, R., & Meditz, S.

The British were able to capture large amounts of precious metals, before a French naval force intervened on behalf of the Spanish King and took down the invading force. However, this caused much turmoil in the area as militia took control of the area from the viceroy. The next year the British attacked once again with a much larger force attempting to reach and conquer Montevideo.<ref>Donghi, 89</ref> They failed to reach [[Montevideo]] but succeeded in establishing an alliance with the locals.

As newly appointed president, Benito Ju\u00e1rez suspended payment of debts for next two years, to focus on a rebuilding and stabilization initiative in Mexico under the new government. On December 8, 1861, Spain, England and France landed in Veracruz in order to seize unpaid debts from Mexico. However, Napoleon III, with intentions of establishing a French client state to further push his economic interests, pressured the other two powers to withdraw in 1862 (Greenspan; \"French Intervention in Mexico\u2026\").\n[[File:Batalla de Puebla.png|upright=0.80|thumb|right|Painting depicting the [[Battle of Puebla]] in 1862]]\nFrance under Napoleon III remained and established Maximilian of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|title=French Intervention in Mexico and the American Civil War, 1862\u20131867|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/french-intervention |website=U.S Department of State Office of the Historian}}</ref> The march by the French to Mexico City enticed heavy resistance by the Mexican government, it resulted in open warfare.

The port city of Veracruz, Mexico and France's desire to construct a new canal were of particular interest. Bridging both New World and East Asian trade routes to the Atlantic were key to Napoleon III's economic goals to the mining of precious rocks and the expansion of France's textile industry. Napoleon's fear of the United States' economic influence over the Pacific trade region, and in turn all New World economic activity, pushed France to intervene in Mexico under the pretense of collecting on Mexico's debt. Eventually France began plans to build the Panama Canal in 1881 until 1904 when the United States took over and proceeded with its construction and implementation (\"Read Our Story\").\n\n===American involvement in Latin America during the 19th century===\n\n====Monroe Doctrine====\n[[File:Roosevelt monroe Doctrine cartoon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Political cartoon depicting [[Theodore Roosevelt]] using the [[Monroe Doctrine]] to keep European powers out of the [[Dominican Republic]]]]\nThe [[Monroe Doctrine]] was included in President [[James Monroe]]'s 1823 annual message to Congress. The doctrine warns European nations that the United States will no longer tolerate any new colonization of Latin American countries. It was originally drafted to meet the present major concerns, but eventually became the precept of U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere. The doctrine was put into effect in 1865 when the U.S. government supported Mexican president, [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], diplomatically and militarily. Some Latin American countries viewed the U.S. interventions, allowed by the Monroe Doctrine when the U.S. deems necessary, with suspicion.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. ''A History of Latin America''. pg 491</ref>\n\nAnother important aspect of United States involvement in Latin America is the case of the [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. In 1855, he traveled to Nicaragua hoping to overthrow the government and take the land for the United States. With only the aid of 56 followers, he was able to take over the city of [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]], declaring himself commander of the army and installing [[Patricio Rivas]] as a puppet president. However, Rivas's presidency ended when he fled Nicaragua; Walker rigged the following election to ensure that he became the next president. His presidency did not last long, however, as he was met with much opposition from political groups in Nicaragua and neighbouring countries. On May 1, 1857, Walker was forced by a coalition of Central American armies to surrender himself to a United States Navy officer who repatriated him and his followers. When Walker subsequently returned to Central America in 1860, he was apprehended by the Honduran authorities and executed.\n\n====Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u201348)====\n[[File:Mexico nebel.jpg|thumb|left|American occupation of [[Mexico City]]]]\n\nThe [[Mexican\u2013American War]], another instance of U.S. involvement in Latin America, was a war between the United States and Mexico that started in April 1846 and lasted until February 1848. The main cause of the war was the United States' annexation of Texas in 1845 and a dispute afterwards about whether the border between Mexico and the United States ended where Mexico claimed, at the [[Nueces River]], or ended where the United States claimed, at the [[Rio Grande]]. Peace was negotiated between the United States and Mexico with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which stated that Mexico was to cede land which would later become part of California and New Mexico as well as give up all claims to Texas, for which the United States would pay $15,000,000. However, tensions between the two countries were still high and over the next six years things only got worse with raids along the border and attacks by Native Americans against Mexican citizens. To defuse the situation, the United States agreed to purchase 29,670 squares miles of land from Mexico for $10,000,000 so a southern railroad could be built to connect the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. This would become known as the [[Gadsden Purchase]]. A critical component of U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs took form in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], which drastically affected the futures of Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Americas, as well as Guam and the Philippines, by dismantling some of the last remaining Spanish colonial possessions throughout the world.\n\n==From the \"Big Stick\" to the \"Good Neighbor\" policy==\n[[File:Satterfield cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic.jpg|thumb|[[Bob Satterfield (cartoonist)|Bob Satterfield]] cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic]]\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the U.S. banana importing companies [[United Fruit Company]], [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]] (both ancestors of [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]]), and [[Standard Fruit Company]] (now [[Dole Food Company|Dole]]), acquired large amounts of land in Central American countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica. The companies gained leverage over the governments and a ruling elite in these countries by dominating their economies and paying kickbacks, and exploited local workers.

The 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War]] resulted in the end of Spanish colonial presence in the Americas. A period of frequent U.S. intervention in Latin America followed, with the acquisition of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] in 1903, the so-called [[Banana Wars]] in Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Honduras; the [[Caco Wars]] in Haiti; and the so-called [[Border War (1910\u20131919)|Border War]] with Mexico.

The proposal was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence. The revelation of the contents outraged the American public and swayed public opinion. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] moved to arm American merchant ships in order to defend themselves against German submarines, which had started to attack them. The news helped generate support for the [[American entry into World War I|United States declaration of war on Germany]] in April of that year.<ref>[[#Andrew|Andrew]], p.&nbsp;42.</ref>\n\nThe message came as a [[code (cryptography)|coded]] telegram dispatched by the Foreign Secretary of the German Empire, [[Arthur Zimmermann]], on January 16, 1917. The message was sent to the German ambassador of Mexico, [[Heinrich von Eckardt]]. Zimmermann sent the telegram in anticipation of the [[Atlantic U-boat campaign of World War I#1917: Renewed \"unrestricted\" campaign|resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare]] by Germany on 1 February, an act which Germany presumed would lead to war. The telegram instructed Ambassador Eckardt that if the U.S. appeared certain to enter the war, he was to approach the Mexican Government with a proposal for a military alliance, with funding from Germany. As part of the alliance, Germany would assist Mexico in reconquering Texas and the Southwest. Eckardt was instructed to urge Mexico to help broker an alliance between Germany and Japan. Mexico, in the middle of the [[Mexican Revolution]], far weaker militarily, economically and politically than the U.S., ignored the proposal; after the U.S. entered the war, it officially rejected it.\n\n====Brazil's participation in World War II====\nAfter World War I, in which Brazil was an ally of the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], and [[France]], the country realized it needed a more capable army but did not have the technology to create it. In 1919, the French Military Mission was established by the French Commission in Brazil. Their main goal was to contain the inner rebellions in Brazil. They tried to assist the army by bringing them up to the European military standard but constant civil missions did not prepare them for [[World War II]].\n\nBrazil's President, [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], wanted to industrialize Brazil, allowing it to be more competitive with other countries. He reached out to Germany, Italy, France, and the United States to act as trade allies. Many Italian and German people immigrated to Brazil many years before World War II began thus creating a Nazi influence. The immigrants held high positions in government and the armed forces. It was recently found that 9,000 war criminals escaped to South America, including Croats, Ukrainians, Russians and other western Europeans who aided the Nazi war machine. Most, perhaps as many as 5,000, went to Argentina; between 1,500 and 2,000 are thought to have made it to Brazil; around 500 to 1,000 to Chile; and the rest to Paraguay and Uruguay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Secret Files Reveal 9,000 Nazi War Criminals Fled to South America after WWII|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2117093/Secret-files-reveal-9-000-Nazi-war-criminals-fled-South-America-WWII.html|newspaper=Mail Online|accessdate=24 May 2012|location=London|first=Allan|last=Hall|date=2012-03-19}}</ref> It was not a secret that Vargas had an admiration for Hitler's Nazi Germany and its F\u00fchrer. He even let German Luftwaffe build secret air forces around Brazil.\nThis alliance with Germany became Brazil's second best trade alliance behind the United States.\n\n[[File:Massarosaw.jpg|right|thumb|Brazilian soldiers greet Italian civilians in the city of [[Massarosa]], September 1944. Brazil was the only independent Latin American country to send ground troops to fight in WWII.]]\n\nBrazil continued to try to remain neutral to the United States and Germany because it was trying to make sure it could continue to be a place of interest for both opposing countries. Brazil attended continental meetings in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1936); Lima, Peru (1938); and Havana, Cuba (1940) that obligated them to agree to defend any part of the Americas if they were to be attacked. Eventually, Brazil decided to stop trading with Germany once Germany started attacking offshore trading ships resulting in Germany declaring a blockade against the Americas in the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, Germany also ensured that they would be attacking the Americas soon.\n\nOnce the German submarines attacked unarmed Brazilian trading ships, President Vargas met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt to discuss how they could retaliate. On January 22, 1942, Brazil officially ended all relations with Germany, Japan, and Italy, becoming a part of the Allies.\n\nThe [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] was sent to Naples, Italy to fight for democracy. Brazil was the only Latin American country to send troops to Europe. Initially, Brazil wanted to only provide resources and shelter for the war to have a chance of gaining a high postwar status but ended up sending 25,000 men to fight.<ref>{{cite web|last=Penteado|first=Carlos Joes A.|title=Hyper War: The Brazilian Participation in World War II|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/Brazil/Participation/index.html|accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, the United States and Latin America continued to have a close relationship.

Brazil began selling automobiles to other countries, and some Latin American countries set up plants to assemble imported parts, letting other countries take advantage of Latin America's low labor costs. Colombia began to export flowers, emeralds and coffee grains and gold, becoming the world's second-leading flower exporter.\n\nEconomic integration was called for, to attain economies that could compete with the economies of the United States or Europe. Starting in the 1960s with the Latin American Free Trade Association and Central American Common Market, Latin American countries worked toward economic integration.\n\nIn efforts to help regain global economic strength, the U.S. began to heavily assist countries involved in World War II at the expense of Latin America.

The United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba, and combined with Castro's expropriation of private enterprises, this was detrimental to the Cuban economy.<ref name=\"History of Latin America\" /> Around Latin America, rural guerrilla conflict and urban terrorism increased, inspired by the Cuban example. The United States put down these rebellions by supporting Latin American countries in their counter-guerrilla operations through the Alliance for Progress launched by President John F. Kennedy. This thrust appeared to be successful. A Marxist, Salvador Allende, became president of Chile in 1970, but was overthrown three years later in a military coup backed by the United States. Despite civil war, high crime and political instability, most Latin American countries eventually adopted bourgeois liberal democracies while Cuba maintained its socialist system.\n\n====Bay of Pigs Invasion====\n{{Main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}\n\n[[Image:Attack near Playa Giron.

Latin American Political History: Patterns and Personalities. pg 376\u2013377</ref> in 1960, the U.S. decided to support an attack on Cuba by anti-Castro rebels. The Bay of Pigs invasion was an unsuccessful invasion of Cuba in 1961, financed by the U.S. through the CIA, to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]]. The incident proved to be very embarrassing for the new Kennedy administration.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Bay of Pigs Invasion|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nThe failure of the invasion led to a [[Cuba\u2013Soviet Union relations|Soviet-Cuban alliance]].\n\n====Cuban Missile Crisis====\n{{Main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}\nIn 1962, Cuba threatened the USA when it allowed Soviet missiles to be placed on the island, just 90 miles away from Florida; Cuba saw it as a way to defend the island, while the Americans saw it as a threat. The ensuing Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014the closest the world has ever come to total annihilation\u2014almost saw a US invasion or bombing of Cuba, but it ended when the two sides agreed on the removal of missiles; the US removed theirs from Italy and Turkey, while the Soviets removed theirs from Cuba. The crisis' end left Cuba blockaded by the US, which was also obligated to not invade Cuba. In fact, they were allowed to keep [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] as a naval base as per an agreement with the previous government of Batista.\n\n====Alliance for Progress====\nPresident John F. Kennedy initiated the [[Alliance for Progress]] in 1961, to establish economic cooperation between the U.S. and Latin America. The Alliance would provide $20 billion for reform in Latin America, and counterinsurgency measures. Instead, the reform failed because of the simplistic theory that guided it and the lack of experienced American experts who could understand Latin American customs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kennedy proposes Alliance for Progress - Mar 13, 1961 - HISTORY.com|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/kennedy-proposes-alliance-for-progress|website=HISTORY|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Foreign interventions by Cuba====\n{{Main|Foreign interventions by Cuba}}\n[[File:Cuban PT-76 Angola.JPG|thumb|A Cuban [[PT-76]] performing routine security duties in [[Angola]] during the [[Cuban intervention in Angola|Cuban intervention into the country]]]]\n[[File:Cubans in Ogaden1.JPG|thumb|Cuban artillerymen in [[Ethiopia]] during the [[Ogaden War]]]]\nArmed Cuban intervention overseas began on 14 June 1959 with an invasion of the Dominican Republic<ref name=CIA/> by a group of fifty-six men, who landed a [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar|C-56]] transport aircraft at the military airport of the town of Constanza. Upon their landing, the fifteen-man Dominican garrison began an ongoing gun battle with the invaders, until the survivors disappeared into the surrounding mountains. Immediately after, the Dominican Air Force bombed the area around Constanza with British made [[de Havilland Vampire|Vampire jets]] in an unsuccessful attempt to kill the invaders, which instead killed civilians.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roorda |first1=Eric Paul |title=Historical Dictionary of the Dominican Republic |date=2016 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=80}}</ref> The invaders either died at the hands of machete-swinging peasants,<ref>{{cite news|title=DOMINICANS HUNT REBEL SURVIVORS; Band of 20 Invaders Eluding Troops and Peasants in Wooded Mountain Area |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/07/02/archives/dominicans-hunt-rebel-survivors-band-of-20-invaders-eluding-troops.html |work=The New York Times |date=July 2, 1959}}</ref> or the military captured, tortured, and imprisoned them. A week later, two yachts offloaded 186 invaders onto Chris-Craft launches for a landing on the north coast. Dominican Air Force pilots fired rockets from their Vampire jets into the approaching launches, killing most of the invaders. The survivors were brutally tortured and murdered.\n\nFrom 1966 until the late 1980s, the Soviet government upgraded Cuba's military capabilities, and Castro saw to it that Cuba assisted with the independence struggles of several countries across the world, most notably Angola and Mozambique in southern Africa, and the anti-imperialist struggles of countries such as Syria, Algeria, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Vietnam.<ref>{{cite book |title=Parameters: Journal of the US Army War College |date=1977 |publisher=U.S. Army War College |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMdLAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA13&lpg=#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name=CIA>{{cite web |title=Foreign Intervention by Cuba |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77M00144R000400100003-7.pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[South Africa]] developed nuclear weapons due to the threat to its security posed by the presence of large numbers of Cuban troops in Angola and Mozambique.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Regime: Prospects for the 21st Century |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |page=95}}</ref> In November 1975, Cuba poured more than 65,000 troops into Angola in one of the fastest military mobilizations in history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why the Cuban military machine should intervene in Syria |url=https://www.rbth.com/blogs/stranger_than_fiction/2015/10/21/why-the-cuban-military-machine-should-intervene-in-syria_484903}}</ref> On 10 November 1975, Cuban forces defeated the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA) in the [[Battle of Quifangondo]].

On 27 March 1976, the last South African troops withdrew from Angola. In September 1977, 12 [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]]s conducted strafing flights over Puerto Plata in Dominican Republic to warn then president Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer against intercepting Cuban warships headed to or returning from Angola.<ref>{{cite web |title=Castro\u2019s turbulent ties with the Dominican Republic |url=https://dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2016/11/27/castros-turbulent-ties-with-the-dominican-republic/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cuba Air Force |url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/americas/cuba/Cuba-af-home.htm|website=www.aeroflight.co.uk}}</ref> In 1988, Cuba returned to Angola with a vengeance.

Within two years, the Cold War was over and Cuba's foreign policy shifted away from military intervention.\n\n====Nicaraguan Revolution====\nFollowing the American occupation of Nicaragua in 1912, as part of the [[Banana Wars]], the Somoza family political dynasty came to power, and would rule Nicaragua until their ouster in 1979 during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. The era of Somoza family rule was characterized by strong U.S. support for the government and its military as well as a heavy reliance on U.S.-based multi-national corporations. The Nicaraguan Revolution (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n Nicarag\u00fcense or Revoluci\u00f3n Popular Sandinista) encompassed the rising opposition to the Somoza dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s, the campaign led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) to violently oust the dictatorship in 1978\u201379, the subsequent efforts of the FSLN to govern Nicaragua from 1979 until 1990 and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Contra War]] which was waged between the FSLN and the [[Contras]] from 1981\u20131990.\n\nThe Revolution marked a significant period in Nicaraguan history and revealed the country as one of the major proxy war battlegrounds of the Cold War with the events in the country rising to international attention. Although the initial overthrow of the Somoza regime in 1978\u201379 was a bloody affair, the Contra War of the 1980s took the lives of tens of thousands of Nicaraguans and was the subject of fierce international debate.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. A history of Latin America. pg541-542</ref> During the 1980s both the FSLN (a leftist collection of political parties) and the Contras (a rightist collection of counter-revolutionary groups) received large amounts of aid from the Cold War super-powers (respectively, the Soviet Union and the United States).\n\n===Washington Consensus===\n{{Main|Washington Consensus}}\n{{See also|Free Trade Area of the Americas}}\n[[File:Ship passing through Panama Canal 01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roll-on/roll-off]]\nships, such as this one pictured here at [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores locks]], are among the largest ships to pass through the [[Panama Canal]]. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of [[Panama]] and is a key conduit for international maritime trade.]]\n\nThe set of specific economic policy prescriptions that were considered the \"standard\" reform package were promoted for crisis-wracked developing countries by Washington, D.C.-based institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], and the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Department of the Treasury]] during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn recent years, several Latin American countries led by socialist or other left wing governments{{spaced ndash}}including Argentina and Venezuela{{spaced ndash}}have campaigned for (and to some degree adopted) policies contrary to the Washington Consensus set of policies. (Other Latin countries with governments of the left, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Peru, have in practice adopted the bulk of the policies.) Also critical of the policies as actually promoted by the International Monetary Fund have been some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], who have challenged what are sometimes described as the \"fundamentalist\" policies of the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury for what Stiglitz calls a \"one size fits all\" treatment of individual economies.\n\nThe term has become associated with neoliberal policies in general and drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the free market, constraints upon the state, and US influence on other countries' national sovereignty.\n\nThis politico-economical initiative was institutionalized in North America by 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], and elsewhere in the Americas through a series of [[Free Trade Area of the Americas#Agreements|like agreements]]. The comprehensive [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] project, however, was rejected by most [[Mercosur|South American countries]] at the 2005 [[4th Summit of the Americas]].\n\n===Turn to the left===\n{{See also|Pink tide}}\n[[File:UNASUR-15SEP2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[UNASUR]] summit in the Palacio de la Moneda, Santiago de Chile]]\nIn most countries, since the 2000s left-wing political parties have risen to power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The presidencies of [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] in Venezuela, [[Ricardo Lagos]] and [[Michelle Bachelet]] in Chile, [[Lula da Silva]] and [[Dilma Rousseff]] in Brazil, [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and his wife [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner|Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]] in Argentina, [[Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mujica]] in Uruguay, [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador, [[Fernando Lugo]] in Paraguay, [[Manuel Zelaya]] in [[Honduras]] (removed from power by a [[2009 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]), [[Mauricio Funes]] and [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]] in El Salvador are all part of this wave of [[left-wing]] politicians who often declare themselves [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Latin American integration|Latin Americanists]], or [[Anti-Imperialism|anti-imperialists]] (often implying [[Anti-Americanism#Latin America|opposition to US]] [[Washington consensus|policies towards the region]]). A development of this has been the creation of the eight-member ALBA alliance, or \"[[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America]]\" (Spanish: ''Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra Am\u00e9rica'') by some of the countries already mentioned. By June 2014, Honduras ([[Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez]]), Guatemala ([[Otto P\u00e9rez Molina]]), and Panama ([[Ricardo Martinelli]]) had right-wing governments.\n\n===Return of social movements===\n[[File:45.

The mural is located in [[Humahuaca]] in the north of [[Argentina]]]]\n\nIn 1982, Mexico announced that it could not meet its foreign debt payment obligations, inaugurating a [[Latin American debt crisis|debt crisis]] that would \"discredit\" Latin American economies throughout the decade.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\">Hershberg, Eric, and Fred Rosen, eds. ''Latin America after Neoliberalism''. New York: North American Congress on Latin America, 2006. Print.</ref> This debt crisis would lead to [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] reforms that would instigate many social movements in the region. A \"reversal of development\" reigned over Latin America, seen through negative economic growth, declines in industrial production, and thus, falling living standards for the middle and lower classes.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Escobar|editor-first=Arturo|editor-first2=Sonia E.|editor-last2=Alvarez|title=The Making of Social Movements in Latin America|location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Westview|date=1992}}</ref> Governments made financial security their primary policy goal over social security, enacting new neoliberal economic policies that implemented privatization of previously national industries and [[Informal sector|informalization]] of labor.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\" /> In an effort to bring more investors to these industries, these governments also embraced [[globalization]] through more open interactions with the international economy.\n\nSignificantly, as democracy spread across much of Latin America, the realm of government became more inclusive (a trend that proved conducive to social movements), the economic ventures remained exclusive to a few elite groups within society. Neoliberal restructuring consistently redistributed income upward while denying political responsibility to provide social welfare rights, and though [[Development studies|development]] projects took place throughout the region, both inequality and poverty increased.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\" /> Feeling excluded from these new projects, the lower classes took ownership of their own democracy through a revitalization of social movements in Latin America.\n\nBoth urban and rural populations had serious grievances as a result of the above economic and global trends and have voiced them in mass demonstrations. Some of the largest and most violent of these have been protests against cuts in urban services, such as the [[Caracazo]] in Venezuela and the [[Argentinazo]] in Argentina.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\">Johnston, Hank, and Paul Almeida, eds.

These movements have benefited considerably from transnational support from conservationists and [[International nongovernmental organizations|INGOs]]. The [[Landless Workers' Movement|Movement of Rural Landless Workers]] (MST) is perhaps the largest contemporary Latin American social movement.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" /> As indigenous populations are primarily rural, indigenous movements account for a large portion of rural social movements, including the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista rebellion]] in Mexico, the [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] ([[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador|CONAIE]]), indigenous organizations in the Amazon region of Ecuador and Bolivia, pan-Mayan communities in Guatemala, and mobilization by the indigenous groups of [[Yanomami]] peoples in the Amazon, [[Guna people|Kuna]] peoples in Panama, and Altiplano [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples in Bolivia.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" /> Other significant types of social movements include labor struggles and strikes, such as [[recovered factories]] in Argentina, as well as gender-based movements such as the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] in Argentina and protests against [[maquila]] production, which is largely a women's issue because of how it draws on women for cheap labor.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" />\n\n===Modern era===\nThe [[2000s commodities boom]] caused positive effects for many Latin American economies.

In the Spanish and Portuguese empires, racial mixing or miscegenation was the norm and something that the Spanish and Portuguese had grown rather accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans in the Iberian peninsula. But, demographics may have made this inevitable as well. Thus, for example, of the approximately 13.5 million people who lived in the Spanish colonies in 1800 before independence only about one fifth were white. This contrasts with the U.S., where more than four fifths were whites (out of a population of 5.3 million in 1801, 900,000 were slaves, plus approximately 60,000 free blacks). ...\n\nThe fact of the recognition of a racial continuum in Hispanic American (sic) does not mean that there wasn't discrimination, which there was, or that there wasn't an obsession with race, or 'castes', as they were sometimes called. ...\n\nIn areas with large indigenous Amerindian populations, a racial mixture resulted, which is known in Spanish as ''mestizos'' ... who are a majority in Mexico, Central America and most of South America. Similarly, when African slaves were brought to the Caribbean region and Brazil, where there was very little indigenous presence left, unions between them and Spanish produced a population of mixed ''mulatos'' ... who are a majority of the population in many of those Spanish-speaking Caribbean basin countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Venezuela). \n}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/race.htm|title=Hispanics and Race|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>\n\nAske has also written that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Spanish colonization was rather different from later English, or British, colonization of North America. They had different '''systems of colonization''' and different methods of subjugation. While the English were primarily interested in grabbing land, the Spanish in addition had a mandate to incorporate the land's inhabitants into their society, something which was achieved by religious conversion and sexual unions which produced a new 'race' of ''mestizos'', a mixture of Europeans and indigenous peoples. ''mestizos'' (sic) form the majority of the population in Mexico, Central America, and much of South America. Racial mixing or miscegenation, after all, was something that the Spanish and Portuguese had been accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans.\n\nSimilarly, later on, when African slaves were introduced into the Caribbean basin region, unions between them and Spaniards produced a population of ''mulatos'', who are a majority of the population in the Caribbean islands (the Antilles) (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico), as well as other areas of the Caribbean region (Colombia, Venezuela and parts of the Central American Caribbean coast). ''mestizos'' (sic) and ''mulatos'' may not have always have been first class citizens in their countries, but they were never disowned in the way the outcomes of unions of Europeans and Native Americans were in the British colonies, where interracial marriages were taboo and one drop of Black or Amerindian blood was enough to make the person 'impure'. \n}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/history.htm|title=Some historical background|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>\n\nIn his famous 1963 book ''[[The Rise of the West]]'', [[William Hardy McNeill]] wrote that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Racially mixed societies arose in most of Spanish and Portuguese America, compounded in varying proportions from European, Indian, and Negro strands. Fairly frequent resort to manumission mitigated the hardships of slavery in those areas; and the Catholic church positively encouraged marriages between white immigrants and Indian women as a remedy for sexual immorality. However, in the southern English colonies and in most of the Caribbean islands, the importation of Negro slaves created a much more sharply polarized biracial society. Strong race feeling and the servile status of nearly all Negroes interdicted intermarriage, practically if not legally. Such discrimination did not prevent interbreeding; but children of mixed parentage were assigned to the status of their mothers. Mulattoes and Indian half-breeds were thereby excluded from the white community. In Spanish (and, with some differences, Portuguese) territories a more elaborate and less oppressive principle of racial discrimination established itself. The handful of persons who had been born in the homelands claimed topmost social prestige; next came those of purely European descent; while beneath ranged the various racial blends to form a social pyramid whose numerous racial distinctions meant that no one barrier could become as ugly and inpenetrable as that dividing whites from Negroes in the English, Dutch, and French colonies.\n}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community|last=McNeill|first=William H.|year=1991|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}, p. 603</ref>\n\nThomas C. Wright, meanwhile, has written that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=The demographic makeup of colonial Latin America became more complex when, as the native population declined, the Portuguese, Spanish, and the French in Haiti turned to Africa for labor, as did the British in North America. The tricontinental heritage that characterizes Latin America, then, is shared by the United States, but even a casual examination reveals that the outcome of the complex interaction of different peoples has varied. While miscegenation among the three races certainly occurred in North America, it appears to have been much less common than in Latin America. Furthermore, offspring of such liaisons were not recognized as belonging to new, distinct racial categories in North America as they were in Latin America. The terms mestizo or ''mameluco'', mulatto, the general term ''castas'', and dozens of subcategories of racial identity frankly recognized the outcomes of interracial sexual activity in Latin America and established a continuum of race rather than the unrealistic absolute categories of white, black, or Indian as used in the United States. (The U.S. Census Bureau's forms did not allow individuals to list more than one race until 2000.)\n}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Latin America since Independence: Two Centuries of Continuity and Change|last=Wright|first=Thomas C.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OuIlDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2017|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781442235724}}, pp. 30 \u2013 31</ref>\n\n===Language===\n[[File:Map-Romance Latin America.svg|thumb|left|Linguistic map of Latin America. Spanish in green, Portuguese in orange, and French in blue.]]\n\n[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the predominant language of Latin America. It is spoken as first language by about 60% of the population. Portuguese is spoken by about 34%, and about 6% speak other languages such as Quechua, [[Mayan languages]], Guaran\u00ed, Aymara, Nahuatl, English, French, Dutch and Italian. Portuguese is spoken only in Brazil ([[Brazilian Portuguese]]), the biggest and most populous country in the region. Spanish is the official language of most of the rest of the countries and territories on the Latin American mainland ([[Spanish language in the Americas]]), as well as in [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] (where it is co-official with English), and the [[Dominican Republic]]. [[French language|French]] is spoken in [[Haiti]] and in the French [[overseas department]]s of [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]] and [[French Guiana|Guiana]], and the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]; it is also spoken by some Panamanians of Afro-Antillean descent. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language in [[Suriname]], [[Aruba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. (As Dutch is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], these territories are not necessarily considered part of Latin America.) However, the native language of Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and Cura\u00e7ao, is [[Papiamento]], a creole language largely based on Portuguese and Spanish and has a considerable influence coming from the Dutch language and [[Portuguese-based creole languages]].\n\n[[File:Map-Most Widely Spoken Native Languages in Latin America.png|thumb|'''{{color|blue|Quechua}}''', '''{{background color|black|{{color|#f9dc38|Guaran\u00ed}}}}''', '''{{background color|black|{{color|#ff9922|Aymara}}}}''', '''{{color|#cc0000|N\u00e1huatl}}''', '''{{color|#006600|Lenguas Mayas}}''', '''Mapudungun''']]\n\n[[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian languages]] are widely spoken in [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Mexico]], and to a lesser degree, in [[Panama]], [[Ecuador]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]] amongst other countries. In Latin American countries not named above, the population of speakers of indigenous languages tend to be very small or even non-existent (e.g. [[Uruguay]]). Mexico is possibly the only country that contains a wider variety of indigenous languages than any Latin American country, but the most spoken language is Nahuatl.\n\nIn [[Peru]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] is an official language, alongside Spanish and any other indigenous language in the areas where they predominate. In [[Ecuador]], while holding no official status, the closely related [[Quichua]] is a recognized language of the indigenous people under the country's constitution; however, it is only spoken by a few groups in the country's highlands. In [[Bolivia]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], Quechua and Guaran\u00ed hold official status alongside Spanish. [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]], along with Spanish, is an official language of [[Paraguay]], and is spoken by a majority of the population (who are, for the most part, bilingual), and it is co-official with Spanish in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] province of [[Corrientes]]. In [[Nicaragua]], Spanish is the official language, but on the country's Caribbean coast English and indigenous languages such as [[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Sumo languages|Sumo]], and [[Rama language|Rama]] also hold official status. [[Colombia]] recognizes all indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official, though fewer than 1% of its population are native speakers of these languages. [[Nahuatl]] is one of the 62 native languages spoken by indigenous people in Mexico, which are officially recognized by the government as \"national languages\" along with Spanish.\n\nOther European languages spoken in Latin America include: [[English language|English]], by some groups in [[Puerto Rico]], as well as in nearby countries that may or may not be considered Latin American, like [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]], and spoken by descendants of British settlers in Argentina & Chile; [[German language|German]], in southern [[Brazil]], southern [[Chile]], portions of [[Argentina]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Paraguay]]; [[Italian language|Italian]], in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and [[Uruguay]]; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] in southern Brazil and Argentina; and [[Welsh language|Welsh]], in southern Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1163503 |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1stclassargentina.com/tours/WelshImmigration.html|title=The Welsh Immigration to Argentina|work=1stclassargentina.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy Howat |url=http://www.argbrit.org/Patagonia/patagonia_entry.htm |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Argbrit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.patagonline.com/patagonia/destacados/peninsula-valdes/gaiman-trelew |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Patagonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andesceltig.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Andesceltig.com |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2013-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917174822/http://andesceltig.com/ |archive-date=2017-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glaniad.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Glaniad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808130811/http://www.glaniad.com/ |archive-date=2016-08-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] are possible to be heard around Buenos Aires and S\u00e3o Paulo especially.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html#4 |title=Brazil \u2013 Modern-Day Community |publisher=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref> Non-European or Asian languages include [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay, [[Korean language|Korean]] in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile, and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] throughout South America.\n\nIn several nations, especially in the Caribbean region, [[creole languages]] are spoken.

The region has made great progress in educational coverage; almost all children attend primary school and access to secondary education has increased considerably. Quality issues such as poor teaching methods, lack of appropriate equipment and overcrowding exist throughout the region. These issues lead to adolescents dropping out of the educational system early.<ref name=\"Welti\">{{cite book |last=Welti|first=Carlos|editor-first=B. |editor-last=Brown|chapter=Adolescents in Latin America: Facing the Future with Skepticism|title=The World's Youth: Adolescence in Eight Regions of the Globe|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=0521006058|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref> Most educational systems in the region have implemented various types of administrative and institutional reforms that have enabled reach for places and communities that had no access to education services in the early 1990s. Compared to prior generations, Latin American youth have seen an increase in their levels of education. On average, they have completed two years schooling more than their parents.<ref name=\"Welti\" />\n\nHowever, there are still 23 million children in the region between the ages of 4 and 17 outside of the formal education system. Estimates indicate that 30% of preschool age children (ages 4\u20135) do not attend school, and for the most vulnerable populations, the poor and rural, this calculation exceeds 40 percent. Among primary school age children (ages 6 to 12), coverage is almost universal; however there is still a need to incorporate 5 million children in the primary education system. These children live mostly in remote areas, are indigenous or Afro-descendants and live in extreme poverty.<ref name=Survey>[BID/EDU Stakeholder Survey 1993/2003, February 8, 2011]</ref>\n\nAmong people between the ages of 13 and 17 years, only 80% are full-time students in the education system; among them only 66% advance to secondary school. These percentages are lower among vulnerable population groups: only 75% of the poorest youth between the ages of 13 and 17 years attend school. Tertiary education has the lowest coverage, with only 70% of people between the ages of 18 and 25 years outside of the education system. Currently, more than half of low income children or living in rural areas fail to complete nine years of education.<ref name=Survey/>\n\n===Crime and violence===\n{{main|Crime and violence in Latin America}}\n[[File:Homicide rates per 100000 people world, UNODC 2012.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|2012 map of countries by [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|homicide rate]].

Minor blocs or trade agreements are the [[G3 Free Trade Agreement]], the [[Dominican Republic \u2013 Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (DR-CAFTA), the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) and the [[Andean Community of Nations]] (CAN). However, major reconfigurations are taking place along opposing approaches to integration and trade; Venezuela has officially withdrawn from both the CAN and G3 and it has been formally admitted into the Mercosur (pending ratification from the Paraguayan legislature). The president-elect of Ecuador has manifested his intentions of following the same path. This bloc nominally opposes any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, although Uruguay has manifested its intention otherwise.

More recently, additional cultural influences came from the United States and Europe during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, due to the growing influence of the former on the world stage and immigration from the latter. The influence of the United States is particularly strong in northern Latin America, especially Puerto Rico, which is an American territory. Prior to 1959, Cuba, who fought for its independence along American soldiers in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], was also known to have a close socioeconomic relation with the United States. In addition, the United States also helped Panama become an independent state from Colombia and built the twenty-mile-long [[Panama Canal Zone]] in Panama which held from 1903 (the [[Panama Canal]] opened to transoceanic freight traffic in 1914) to 1999, when the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]] restored Panamanian control of the Canal Zone. South America experienced waves of immigration of Europeans, especially Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Germans, Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Russians, Croatians, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews. With the end of colonialism, [[Culture of France|French culture]] was also able to exert a direct influence in Latin America, especially in the realms of [[high culture]], science and medicine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stepan|first=Nancy Leys |title=\"The Hour of Eugenics\": Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |location=Ithaca |pages=in passim |nopp=true |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NuUxkMC1ePYC |isbn=978-0-8014-9795-7}}</ref> This can be seen in any expression of the region's artistic traditions, including painting, literature and music, and in the realms of science and politics. \nDue to the impact of Enlightenment ideals after the French revolution, a certain number of Iberian-American countries decriminalized homosexuality after France and French territories in the Americas in 1791. Some of the countries that abolished sodomy laws or banned any reference to state interference in consensual adult sexuality in the 19th century were Dominican Republic (1822), Brazil (1824), Peru (1836), Mexico (1871), Paraguay (1880), Argentina (1887), Honduras (1899), Guatemala and El Salvador. Today same-sex marriage is legal in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Uruguay, and French overseas departments, as well as in several states of Mexico. Civil unions can be held in Chile.\n\n* [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]], whose presence derives from a long history of [[Atlantic slave trade|New World slavery]]. Peoples of African descent have influenced the ethno-scapes of Latin America and the Caribbean.

In general, this artistic Eurocentrism began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge the uniqueness of their condition and started to follow their own path.\n\n[[File:Santiago Martinez Delgado in the colombian congress.jpg|thumb|right|Mural by [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] in the [[Colombian Congress]]]]\n\nFrom the early twentieth century, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Barreiro |first=Gabriel|date=December 1994|title=Constructivism in Latin America |journal=University of Essex Collection of Latin American Art|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The Movement quickly spread from Russia to Europe and then into Latin America.

Historically, the main centers of production have been Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba.  Latin American film flourished after sound was introduced in cinema, which added a linguistic barrier to the export of Hollywood film south of the border.<ref>Paul A. Schroeder Rodriguez. ''Latin American Cinema: A Comparative History'' (University of California Press; 2016) studies 50 films since the silent era.</ref>\n[[File:Alejandro Inarritu Cannes 2017.jpg|right|upright|thumb|In 2015, [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] became the second Mexican director in a row to win both the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award]] and the [[Directors Guild of America Award]] for Best Director. He won his second [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 2016 for ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]''.]]\n\n[[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]] started out in the silent era from 1896 to 1929 and flourished in the [[Golden age of the cinema of Mexico|Golden Era]] of the 1940s. It boasted a huge industry comparable to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] at the time with stars such as [[Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], and [[Pedro Infante]]. In the 1970s, <!-- and 1970s --> Mexico was the location for many cult horror and action movies. More recently, films such as ''[[Amores Perros]]'' (2000) and ''[[Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n]]'' (2001) enjoyed box office and critical acclaim and propelled [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] and [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] to the front rank of Hollywood directors. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu directed in 2010 ''[[Biutiful]]'' and [[Birdman (film)|''Birdman'']] (2014), Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n directed ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013).  Close friend of both, [[Guillermo del Toro]], a top rank Hollywood director in Hollywood and Spain, directed ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' (2006) and produced ''[[The Orphanage (2007 film)|El Orfanato]]'' (2007). [[Carlos Carrera]] (''[[The Crime of Father Amaro (film)|The Crime of Father Amaro]])'', and screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] are also some of the most known present-day Mexican film makers. ''[[Rudo y Cursi]]'' released in December (2008) in Mexico was directed by [[Carlos Cuar\u00f3n]].\n[[File:Cristina, elenco y Oscar.jpg|left|thumb|President [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]] with the film director [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella]] and the cast of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009) with the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film]]]]\n\n[[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine cinema]] has also been prominenent since the first half of the 20th century and today averages over 60 full-length titles yearly. The industry suffered during the [[Proceso de Reorganizaci\u00f3n Nacional|1976\u20131983 military dictatorship]]; but re-emerged to produce the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[The Official Story]]'' in 1985. A wave of imported U.S. films again damaged the industry in the early 1990s, though it soon recovered, thriving even during the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|Argentine economic crisis]] around 2001. Many Argentine movies produced during recent years have been internationally acclaimed, including ''[[Nueve reinas]]'' (2000), ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (2001), ''[[El abrazo partido]]'' (2004), ''[[El otro]]'' (2007), the 2010 Foreign Language [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[El secreto de sus ojos]]'' and ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (2014).\n\n[[Cinema of Brazil|In Brazil]], the ''[[Cinema Novo]]'' movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays, a clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors in a tropical landscape, and a political message. The modern Brazilian film industry has become more profitable inside the country, and some of its productions have received prizes and recognition in Europe and the United States, with movies such as ''[[Central do Brasil (film)|Central do Brasil]]'' (1999), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|Cidade de Deus]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tropa de Elite]]'' (2007).\n\n[[Cinema of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican cinema]] has produced some notable films, such as ''[[Una Aventura Llamada Menudo]]'', ''[[Los Diaz de Doris]]'' and ''[[Casi Casi]]''. An influx of Hollywood films affected the local film industry in Puerto Rico during the 1980s and 1990s, but several Puerto Rican films have been produced since and it has been recovering.\n\n[[Cinema of Cuba|Cuban cinema]] has enjoyed much official support since the [[Cuban revolution]] and important film-makers include [[Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Latin American literature}}\n{{See also|List of Latin American writers}}\n\n[[File:Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1772).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] in 1772 by Andr\u00e9s de Islas]]\n[[File:Jorge Luis Borges Hotel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Argentine [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in [[L'H\u00f4tel]], [[Paris]] in 1969]]\n\nPre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate [[Aztec codices|codices]]. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the [[Popol Vuh]]. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]-speaking population of Peru and the [[K'iche' people|Quich\u00e9 (K'iche')]] of Guatemala.\n\nFrom the very moment of Europe's discovery of the continents, early explorers and [[conquistadores]] produced written accounts and cr\u00f3nicas of their experience{{spaced ndash}}such as [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s letters or [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]]'s description of the conquest of Mexico. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, within which context [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Towards the end of the 18th Century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive [[Criollo (people)|criollo]] literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as Lizardi's ''[[El Periquillo Sarniento]]'' (1816).\n\nThe 19th century was a period of \"foundational fictions\" (in critic Doris Sommer's words), novels in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focussed on the indigenous question or the dichotomy of \"civilization or barbarism\" (for which see, say, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Domingo Sarmiento]]'s ''[[Facundo]]'' (1845), [[Juan Le\u00f3n Mera]]'s ''Cumand\u00e1'' (1879), or [[Euclides da Cunha]]'s ''[[Os Sert\u00f5es]]'' (1902)). The 19th century also witnessed the realist work of [[Machado de Assis]], who made use of surreal devices of metaphor and playful narrative construction, much admired by critic [[Harold Bloom]].\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, ''[[modernismo]]'' emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]]'s ''Azul'' (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]], for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.\n\n[[File:Gabriela Mistral-01.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Chilean poet [[Gabriela Mistral]], first Latin American to win a [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], in 1945]]\n[[File:Gabogarciamarquez1.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] signing a copy of ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'']]\n\nHowever, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary [[Latin American Boom|boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort\u00e1zar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude|Cien a\u00f1os de soledad]]'' (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with [[magic realism]], though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]] do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s monumental ''Yo, el supremo'' (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], and above all [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were also rediscovered.\n\nContemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling [[Paulo Coelho]] and [[Isabel Allende]] to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as [[Diamela Eltit]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[Ricardo Piglia]], or [[Roberto Bola\u00f1o]]. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of [[Testimony#Literature|testimonio]], texts produced in collaboration with [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] subjects such as [[Rigoberta Mench\u00fa]]. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic [[Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is]] and Pedro Lemebel.\n\nThe region boasts six [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize winners]]: in addition to the two Chilean poets [[Gabriela Mistral]] (1945) and [[Pablo Neruda]] (1971), there is also the Guatemalan novelist [[Miguel Angel Asturias]] (1967), the Colombian writer [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] (1982),  the Mexican poet and essayist [[Octavio Paz]] (1990), and the Peruvian novelist [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (2010).\n\n===Music and dance===\n{{See also|Music of Latin America|Latin pop|Latin dance}}\n[[File:Salsa en Cali.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] dancing in [[Cali]], [[Colombia]]]]\n\nLatin America has produced many successful worldwide artists in terms of recorded global music sales.

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel. Fiat did not say which country it was headed to.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fiat builds 2,000,000 Panda in Polish plant|url=http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-builds-2000000-panda-in-polish-plant/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019113456/http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-builds-2000000-panda-in-polish-plant/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-10-19|publisher=European Car News}}</ref>\n\n===Panda Classic===\nThe Panda Classic<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-panda-classic-prezzo-di-lancio-da-7900-euro |title=Fiat panda Classic |language=it |publisher=Quattroruote.it |accessdate=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723012958/http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-panda-classic-prezzo-di-lancio-da-7900-euro |archivedate=23 July 2012  }}</ref> was a second series Fiat Panda renamed and with a reduced list price to distinguish it from the new generation introduced in late 2011. The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

Due to the cylinders being both located under the [[floorpan]], the boot's volume is reduced only by 25 liters - 200 L instead of the monofuel's 225. On the other hand, this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no \"4x4\" inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.\n\nAvailable on this model are the 0.9 ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol and 1.3 ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the \"Traction +\" ESC-based electronically simulated front [[locking differential]]<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" /> and the standard [[M+S|M+S tires]], along with the ''TwinAir Natural Power'' turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.\n\nThe Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.\n\n[[File:' 12 - ITALY - Fiat Panda 4x4 Off-road test drive - Motorshow di Bologna cut.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Panda 4x4 in action]]\n\n====Panda 4x4====\nThe third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2012/cars/fiat/08/panda_4x4/2908.html|title=Panda 4x4|accessdate=3 September 2012|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref> The engine lineup includes the ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol engine and ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel.

To insure its practicality, he conceived that the Panda's cargo area should accommodate no less than two 50-liter wine [[carboy|demijohn]]s, along with a full complement of passengers.<ref name=\"tribe2\">{{cite web\n |title        = History of the Fiat Panda - Part 1: The Origins\n |publisher    = Drivetribe\n |author       =\n |date         =\n |url          = https://drivetribe.com/p/history-of-the-fiat-panda-part-CQGlc3ZwRvmfbkoym7iz1w?iid=CaW4wX0HTyiRlcokMiJEOA}}</ref><ref name=\"demijohn\">{{cite web\n |title        = Fiat Panda compie 40 anni\n |publisher    = GQ\n |author       = lessandro Vai\n |date         = March 2, 2020\n |url          = https://www.gqitalia.it/tech-auto/article/fiat-panda-40-anni-storia-foto}}</ref> \n\nGiugiaro and Mantovani completed the design for its August 7 deadline, discovering only then that Benedetto had left Fiat.<ref name=\"summer\">{{cite web\n |title        = That summer in which Giugiaro created the Fiat Panda, over 40 years ago\n |publisher    = gazzatta.it\n |author       = Savina Confaloni\n |date         = February 29, 2020\n |url          = https://www.gazzetta.it/motori/la-mia-auto/28-02-2020/quell-estate-cui-giugiaro-creo-fiat-panda-oltre-40-anni-fa-3601311731177.shtml}}</ref>\n\nDespite Benedetto's departure, Italdesign presented Fiat with two full-scale models, four alternative side designs, an interior buck or mockup and a comprehensive study of the Panda's competition &mdash; as well as a series of tempera renderings by Giugiaro.<ref name=\"first\"/> Under the prototyping designation ''Progetto 141,''<ref name=\"tribe1\"/> Fiat subsequently commissioned Italdesign to create production studies, a master model, provisional tooling and pre-production prototypes.

An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980, with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nOn February 26, 1980, Fiat presented the Panda to President [[Sandro Pertini]], in the gardens of Rome's [[Quirinal Palace]], and the car officially debuted in Geneva on March 5th \u2014 carrying the ''Panda'' name. \n\nIn the two months following the Geneva motor show, Fiat received over 70,000 orders for the Panda.\n\n===Design===\nItaldesign's work highlighted utilitarian practicality throughout the design. Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

Rear suspension used a [[solid axle]] suspended on [[leaf spring]]s. Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The new architecture is based on the [[Fiat Mini platform]]. The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda.

Due to the cylinders being both located under the [[floorpan]], the boot's volume is reduced only by 25 liters - 200 L instead of the monofuel's 225. On the other hand, this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no \"4x4\" inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.\n\nAvailable on this model are the 0.9 ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol and 1.3 ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the \"Traction +\" ESC-based electronically simulated front [[locking differential]]<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" /> and the standard [[M+S|M+S tires]], along with the ''TwinAir Natural Power'' turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.\n\nThe Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.\n\n[[File:' 12 - ITALY - Fiat Panda 4x4 Off-road test drive - Motorshow di Bologna cut.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Panda 4x4 in action]]\n\n====Panda 4x4====\nThe third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2012/cars/fiat/08/panda_4x4/2908.html|title=Panda 4x4|accessdate=3 September 2012|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref> The engine lineup includes the ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol engine and ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel.
