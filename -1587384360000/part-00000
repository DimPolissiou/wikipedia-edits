Snow can be classified by describing the [[Winter storm|weather event]] that is producing it, the shape of its [[ice crystals]] or [[Snowflake|flakes]], how it collects on the ground, and thereafter how it changes form and composition. Depending on the status of the snow in the air or on the ground, a different classification applies.\n\nSnowfall arises from a variety of events that vary in intensity and cause, subject to classification by weather bureaus. Some snowstorms are part of a larger weather pattern. Other snowfall occurs from [[Lake-effect snow|lake effects]] or atmospheric instability near mountains. Falling snow takes many different forms, depending on atmospheric conditions, especially vapor content and temperature, as it falls to the ground. Once on the ground, snow crystals metamorphose into different shapes, influenced by wind, freeze-thaw and [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. Snow on the ground forms a variety of shapes, formed by wind and thermal processes, all subject to ''formal'' classifications both by scientists and by ski resorts. Those who work and play in snowy landscapes have ''informal'' classifications, as well.\n\nThere is a long history of northern and alpine cultures describing snow in their different languages, including [[Inupiaq language|Inupiat]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pruitt|first=William O.

The grain shape is further characterized, using the following categories (with code): precipitation particles (PP), machine-made snow (MM), decomposing and fragmented precipitation particles (DF), rounded grains (RG), faceted crystals (FC), depth hoar (DH), surface hoar (SH), melt forms (MF), and ice formations (IF). Other measurements and characteristics are used as well, including a snow profile of a vertical section of the snowpack.<ref name=\"Classificationonground\" /> Some snowpack features include:\n\n*''Crust'' \u2014 A variety of processes can create a crust, a layer of snow on the surface of the snowpack that is stronger than the snow below, which may be powder snow. Crusts often result from partial melting of the snow surface by direct sunlight or warm air followed by re-freezing, but can also be created by wind or by surface water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Snow_crust|title=Snow crust - AMS Glossary|website=glossary.ametsoc.org|language=en|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref>  Snow travelers consider the thickness and resulting strength of a crust to determine whether it is \"unbreakable\", meaning that they will support the weight of the traveler or \"breakable\", meaning that it will not.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TOADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34&dq=breakable+crust+skiing#v=onepage&q=breakable%20crust%20skiing&f=false|title=Become a backcountry expert|last=Tejada-Flores|first=Lito|date=December 1982|publisher=Backpacker|isbn=|location=|pages=28\u201334|language=en}}</ref>\n*''Depth hoar'' \u2014 [[Depth hoar]] comprises faceted snow crystals, usually poorly or completely unbonded (unsintered) to adjacent crystals, creating a weak zone in the snowpack.  Depth hoar forms from metamorphism of the snowpack in response to a large temperature gradient between the warmer ground beneath the snowpack and the surface.  The relatively high porosity (percentage of air space), relatively warm temperature (usually near freezing point), and unbonded weak snow in this layer can allow various organisms to live in it.<ref name=\"Classificationonground\" />\n*''Machine-made'' \u2014 Machine-made [[Snowmaking|artificial snow]] has two classifications: round, polycrystalline particles, which are produced by the freezing of water droplets expelled from a snow cannon, and shard-like ice plates, which are produced by the shaving of ice.<ref name=\"Classificationonground\" />\n*''Surface hoar'' \u2014 Surface hoar is manifest as striated, usually flat, sometimes needle-like crystals, usually deposited as [[frost]] on a snow surface that is colder than the air.

Snow can be classified by describing the [[Winter storm|weather event]] that is producing it, the shape of its [[ice crystals]] or [[Snowflake|flakes]], how it collects on the ground, and thereafter how it changes form and composition. Depending on the status of the snow in the air or on the ground, a different classification applies.\n\nSnowfall arises from a variety of events that vary in intensity and cause, subject to classification by weather bureaus. Some snowstorms are part of a larger weather pattern. Other snowfall occurs from [[Lake-effect snow|lake effects]] or atmospheric instability near mountains. Falling snow takes many different forms, depending on atmospheric conditions, especially vapor content and temperature, as it falls to the ground. Once on the ground, snow crystals metamorphose into different shapes, influenced by wind, freeze-thaw and [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. Snow on the ground forms a variety of shapes, formed by wind and thermal processes, all subject to ''formal'' classifications both by scientists and by ski resorts. Those who work and play in snowy landscapes have ''informal'' classifications, as well.\n\nThere is a long history of northern and alpine cultures describing snow in their different languages, including [[Inupiaq language|Inupiat]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pruitt|first=William O.

The Duke of Wellington assisted in securing royal patronage, the text of which stated that with the authority of [[King George IV]] such schools would be named \"The King's Schools\". It is said,{{by whom|date=December 2015}} although no documentation exists, that royal sanction was granted by [[King William IV]]. Two schools were opened in 1832: the first in [[Pitt Street, Sydney]], the other in George Street, [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]], {{convert|25|km}} inland. The former, opened in January, closed eight months later after the death of its first headmaster, while the Parramatta campus remained open under the stewardship of Robert Forrest, who was<!--had been? Confused about timing.--> appointed headmaster in 1831.\n\nAccording to ''The King's School 1831\u20131981'', on opening day, Monday, 13 February 1832, with a handful of pupils.<ref name=\"HistoricalSociety\">{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~jray/kings/gunther.htm |title=A short history of The King's School, Parramatta |accessdate=2007-10-22 |year =1903 |work=Australian Historical Society}}</ref> Forrest was paid a salary of \u00a3100 per annum, but it was inclusive of a land and housing grant. From fees of \u00a328 and \u00a38 per annum for boarders and day pupils respectively he was expected to maintain boarders and pay the salaries of his assistants, whose fees were \u00a34 per annum for each pupil taught. According to an article in the ''Australian Historical Society Journal'' in 1903, enrolment reached over 100 pupils before the end of the first year.<ref name=\"HistoricalSociety\"/>\n\nBy 1839, Forrest's health had deteriorated and he submitted his resignation. Ill-health caused the school to experience a rapid succession of headmasters in the following decade. William Clarke was appointed headmaster to replace Forrest, and John Troughton was appointed master in charge of boarders. Two years later W. W. Simpson became headmaster, but an epidemic of [[scarlet fever]] in 1843 forced his resignation. James Walker, a notable botanist and classical scholar, succeeded Simpson, but ill-health resulted in his resignation in December 1847.\n\nIn 1848 Forrest returned to the school, which had now had 60 pupils, but he was again forced to resign due to illness in September 1853. In July 1854, Thomas Druitt was appointed headmaster and established military drill in April 1855, a compulsory subject overseen by W. Bamford. Druitt had been under the impression that his appointment was permanent and he refused to relinquish his position upon the arrival of his replacement, Frederick Armitage, in January 1855. It was not until the intervention of Bishop [[Frederic Barker]] in May 1855 that Druitt agreed to stand down.\n\nUnder the helm of Armitage, the school experienced a protracted period of expansion in facilities and enrolments, due to his significant wealth, which allowed him to pay for many of the improvements personally.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The number of pupils increased to nearly 200, 150 of whom were boarders. Pupils studied for seven hours per day in summer and six hours in winter. As well as religious holidays, there were two official school holidays per year, including a mid-winter vacation from 15 June to 15 July, and a mid-summer vacation from 24 December to 31 January. In 1859 Armitage adopted school arms similar to those of [[The King's School Canterbury]] in England, which according to ''The King's School 1831\u20131981'', was due to the erroneous assumption that the Australian school was named after the English one. He applied for leave in 1862 to attend to his ill wife and to obtain a mathematics degree at the [[University of Cambridge]], but he never returned. By the end of his tenure, he had raised the standard and quality of education to a high level.<ref name=\"AusBiography\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Mccormack |first=Terri |encyclopedia=Australian Dictionary of Biography |title=Frederick Armitage (1827\u20131906) |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A030048b.htm |accessdate=2008-01-27 |edition=Online |year=1969 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press]] |volume=3 |location=Melbourne | pages=49}}</ref>\n\nThe acting headmaster appointed prior to Armitage's departure, LJ Trollope, saw a drastic contraction in the number of pupils to just 10 by June 1864, resulting in the closure of the school. There are varying accounts as to the reasons underpinning the school's rapid and sudden decline, including the school's poor financial situation, the dilapidated buildings and competition from other schools, while ''The King's School 1831\u20131981'' claims that it was a series of successive rainstorms causing the collapse of the schoolroom roof that forced its closure. Other accounts have blamed Armitage as lacking the discipline to continue as headmaster. The ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'' argues that while the departure of Armitage was not ideal, \"a headmastership devoid of endowment or guaranteed salary in a colonial school without a council or adequate financial support could hardly have been attractive to a scholarly English gentleman.\"<ref name=\"AusBiography\"/> The school reopened in January 1869 with George Fairfowl Macarthur as Headmaster. Macarthur had been a pupil at The King's School during its early years.\n\n== Campus ==\n{{Infobox historic site\n| name = Kings School Group (former)\n| image = Tks1890.jpg\n| caption = The King's School {{circa|1890}}\n| map_relief = yes\n| locmapin = \n| map_width = 250px\n| map_caption = Location in [[Sydney|greater metropolitan Sydney]]\n| map_dot_mark = \n| map_label = \n| coordinates = {{coord|33.80985234|151.00224321|display=inline|format=dms|type:edu_region:AU-NSW}}\n| location = 3 Marist Place, [[Parramatta]], [[Parramatta City Council]], [[New South Wales]], Australia\n| area = \n| elevation = \n| height = \n| beginning_label = Design period\n| beginning_date = \n| formed = \n| founded = \n| built = 1833&ndash;\n| built_for = \n| demolished = \n| architect = {{bulleted list|[[Ambrose Hallen]]|Blacket Brothers|Moorhouse & Isaacs|Power Adam & Munnings}}\n| architecture = [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Georgian Revival|Georgian Revival]]\n| owner = NSW Department of Health\n| designation1 = New South Wales State Heritage Register\n| designation1_offname = Heritage Office Building, Marsden Rehabilitation Centre, Laurel House, Old King's School, Old Kings School\n| designation1_type = State heritage (complex / group)\n| designation1_date = 2 April 1999\n| delisted1_date = \n| designation1_partof = \n| designation1_number = 771\n| designation1_free1name = Type\n| designation1_free1value = Education\n| designation1_free2name = Category\n| designation1_free2value = School - Private\n| designation1_free3name = Builders\n| designation1_free3value = C.

Within the senior school, there are extensive facilities, including the Centre for Learning and Leadership, dining hall and separate buildings for visual arts, music, science, drama, agriculture, [[PDHPE]] and industrial design and technology. Futter Hall, the main school hall, and the staff centre adjacent to it are other facilities present in the academic precinct, known as 'the Quadrangle'. There are 35 classrooms, all equipped with audio-visual and computer facilities. The school theatre was renovated in June 2010, adding a second smaller theatre and drama classrooms. The school also opened its new $20&nbsp;million science centre in March 2014, which includes classrooms and labs where students can work with collaboratively with researchers from [[The University of Sydney]].\n\nSporting facilities include 15 playing fields used for both cricket and [[rugby union]], 14 tennis courts, 12 basketball courts (nine outdoor, three indoor), 7 football fields, a 50-metre lap pool, a 25-metre swimming pool, a diving pool, and a gym under which there is an indoor rifle range. The Sports Centre opened in 2007 and includes two basketball courts, a fully equipped gym and fitness centre, and PDHPE classrooms. The school also has a rowing facility in [[Putney, New South Wales|Putney]] on the Parramatta River.\n\nThere are also a number of boarding houses for students who reside at the school, and private residences adjacent to the boarding houses for teachers and their families who provide pastoral care for these boys.\n\nOther features of the school include an agricultural yard, greenhouse, a dam, vineyard, bamboo forest, a mountain biking course, and a number of heritage landmarks.\n\n== House system ==\n\n=== Senior school ===\n[[File:TKS CLL.jpg|thumb|280px|The Centre for Learning and Leadership, which includes a library, an auditorium, computer laboratories and classrooms]]\nUntil 2011 the school had [[house system|14 houses]], for both day students and boarders. The boarding houses comprised Gowan Brae, Baker, Bishop Barker, Broughton, Forrest, Hake Harris, Macarthur and Waddy, and the day student houses Britten, Burkitt, Dalmas, Kurrle, Macquarie and Wickham. In that year, the school made a number of changes to its house system, which now consists of six-day houses and five boarding houses. The boarding houses include Gowan Brae, Baker-Hake, Bishop Barker-Harris, Broughton-Forrest, Macarthur-Waddy, and the day student houses include Britten, Burkitt, Dalmas, Kurrle, Macquarie and Wickham. The houses are hubs for students' recreational and pastoral activities. During the course of a year, inter-house competitions take place where students earn points for their respective house by competing in events. The winning house at the end of the year receives the King's Cup.\n\nKurrle and Wickham were created as a result of an expansion in enrolments in 2001, and the remaining Houses have been in existence for several decades. Their names are derived from former Headmasters and Deputy Headmasters, the founder of the school (Broughton), and the traditional name of the school site (Gowan Brae).\n\n=== Preparatory school ===\nThe preparatory school has four houses: Stiles, Thomas, Blaxland and Harrison. Blaxland includes both boarders and day students, and boarders are housed within Gowan Brae, which is shared with Year 7 students. Each year there are competitions between the four houses such as athletics competitions and swimming carnivals.\n\nGowan Brae serves as an intermediate step between primary and secondary schooling, allowing Year 7 students the opportunity to adapt to the unique institutions of the senior school while remaining within a common peer group of similar age.\n\nKing's also operates a small co-educational preparatory boarding school, Tudor House, in Moss Vale, in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales 70 miles away.\n\n== Uniform ==\nThe school uniform is the oldest [[military uniform]] still worn in Australia.<ref name=\"Newsletter1\">{{Cite news|last=Hawkes|first=Timothy|publication-date=9 February 2007|year=2007|title=Celebrating 175 Years|periodical=King's Herald|publication-place=Parramatta, NSW|publisher=The King's School|issue=1|pages=1|url=http://www.kings.edu.au/documents/heralds07/herald0107.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829100630/http://www.kings.edu.au/documents/heralds07/herald0107.pdf|archivedate=29 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}.</ref> It consists of navy blue trousers with a vertical red stripe, a white shirt, black shoes, and a jacket made of a black and white woollen material, stitched in a birdseye pattern. It has red cuffs and red tabs on each side of the collar. The cuffs and epaulets are each surmounted by a braided red \"Lovers' Knot\". The uniform reflects the military history of the school, and is similar to the blazers worn at the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. \n[[File:KingsPupils1931.jpg|thumb|280px|William Archer Gunn and fellow King's students in uniform, c. 1931]]\nThe jacket may be modified in a number of ways. Military insignia can be stitched onto the right arm to show rank in the [[Australian Army Cadets]], a white lanyard may be worn by members of the Marching Band, and the Regimental Sergeant Major may wear the Coat of Arms on the left arm. Cadet Under Officers wear a different grey jacket, which has diamond lozenges on the shoulder tabs and a silver braided 'Lover's Knot'.\n\nAll students except the monitors wear one badge on a red tab on the right collar of the jacket. This is because students of lower rank would have carried rifles over one shoulder, thus damaging the additional badge, while monitors would instead be armed with pistols. House monitors wear one badge each side and school monitors wear one badge on each side with blue collar tabs. The school captain wears one crown on each blue collar tab. All the buttons are silver in colour, and are manufactured by Stokes & Sons.\n\nIn Years 11 and 12 students are allowed to wear a white pin-striped navy blue blazer (known as a ''butchers coat'') or a sky-blue \"honours blazer\". Both blazers have pockets that may have special stitching commemorating academic, sporting or cultural achievements in the form of honours, full or half colours. Outstanding achievement is rewarded by honours colours and is signified by the sky-blue blazer and gold embroidery on the blazer's pocket. Full colours are represented by white embroidery and half colours are shown by dark blue embroidery on the pocket of the pin-striped navy blue blazer.\n\nThe grey jacket and blazers must be worn with a standard black tie commemorating the death of [[Queen Victoria]] (although this was temporarily substituted in 2007 during the 175th anniversary by a navy-blue silk tie, with the King's crest and the number 175 scattered on it).\n\nThe preparatory school uniform differs slightly from that of the senior school. Students from Kindergarten to Year 2 wear navy-blue shorts with the vertical red stripe, knee-high black socks and a white pin-striped navy blue (butchers coat) blazer, while students from Years 3\u20136 wear the same shorts and socks, but with the grey blazer of the senior school.\n\n== Co-curricular activities ==\nCo-curricular activities offered by the school include debating, choir, theatre, bands and ensembles, sport, and the [[Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme]]. Clubs for senior students (the Twelve Club, the Cartesian Club, the [[Scipionic Circle]], and the Tom Barrett Society) meet once a month, to discuss the current affairs and present papers on topical issues.\n\nThe school produces at least one musical and two drama productions each year. Productions have included ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[The Mikado]]'', ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' (2015), ''Addams Family'' (2016), ''A Fleeting Night's Dream'' (2017) and  ''We Will Rock You'' (2018).{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n=== Academic clubs ===\nThe headmaster, deputy headmaster, and other senior staff host intellectual clubs composed of promising senior students. The clubs include the Twelve Club, hosted by the Headmaster, The Cartesian Club hosted by the Deputy Headmaster, the Scipionic Circle, hosted by the Director of Student Services, and the Tom Barrett Society, hosted by the school Registrar. The members of these clubs are selected for their success in areas of academics, leadership and character.\n\n=== Debating ===\nThe preparatory school competes in the IPSHA and ISDA debating competitions, and the senior school in the GPS and ISDA competitions. The school won the ISDA competition, the largest independent schools competition in NSW, for the first time in 2004. The school was represented by national and world championship winning representative teams in 2004.\n\n=== Cadet corps ===\n[[File:Tkspassingout.JPG|thumb|280px|The cadet corps's annual passing-out parade on the JS White Oval. The school chapel is in the background.]]\nFounded in 1868, the cadet corps vies with [[Newington College]]<ref>[https://archive.is/20140709094729/http://prezi.com/exobgjwkgrdf/copy-of-australian-army-cadets/ Australian Army Cadets]</ref> as the oldest<ref>http://www.lancers.org.au/site/The_Military_at_Parramatta.asp</ref> in Australia. All students in Years 9 and 10 are required to undergo cadet training, during which they are taught survival techniques, abseiling, shooting, map-reading, marching, and other skills. Each year the annual field exercise, or  \"Corps Camp\", is held at the [[Singleton, New South Wales|Singleton]] Military Area. The Corps is regarded as the largest unit from any single school, however is just surpassed by one other Unit, made up of several schools.\n\nThe Cadet Corps holds an annual passing-out parade, which commemorates the departure of the Year 12 members and the transfer of student leadership to Year 11 through the handing over of the unit colours. It is usually presided over by a high-ranking member of the [[Australian Defence Force]].\n\nThe King's School Marching Band is a central element of the cadet corps. The Band consists mainly of members of the School's Symphonic Band; it marches annually at the [[ANZAC Day]] Parade in central Sydney. The Band is overseen and directed in partnership with the Music Department, and incorporated into two platoons under the Cadet Corps command structure. There is an annual appointee to the position of Drum Major \u2013 generally a year 12 boy who demonstrates musical skill and leadership capacities.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe school has a music program that caters for a range of musical abilities, held in the sesquicentenary music building. Music at the school forms part of the curricula and co-curricula programs. The school has two pipe organs: a chapel organ in the memorial chapel and a large baroque pipe organ in Futter Hall.<ref name=SydneyOrgan>{{cite web|title=Kings School Parramatta|url=http://www.sydneyorgan.com/Kings.html|website=The Organ Music Society of Sydney|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Curriculum====\nYear 7 students complete the mandatory 100-hour [[Board of Studies]] (NSW) music course, which introduces them to basic concepts of music in a variety of styles. Year 7 boys participate in a singing program and undertake a theory exam toward the end of the year. As part of the Year 8\u201310 elective program, students can continue to study music in these years. They are required to learn an instrument as part of this course and regular performance assessments take place. For the [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|HSC]], students can continue their music studies in either the Music 1 or Music 2 courses, with the option of choosing Music Extension as well. Music 1 and 2 cover a variety of music styles, however, the Music 2 course has a focus on [[Western art music]]. Recently the school has been successful in this field, with a number of student performances and compositions nominated for ENCORE.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n====Co-curricular program====\nThe school has seven large Wind Bands, which form the core of the Wind, Brass and Percussion program. The Symphonic Band is the school's elite level band and is composed of musicians typically studying AMEB or Trinity Grade 7 and above. The Wind Orchestra is the middle ensemble within the senior school, whilst Gowan Brae Band is a special ensemble for year 7 students only, which receives extra attention and allows students to develop their talents intensively upon their arrival at King's. The marching band includes members of the Symphonic Band who are enrolled as cadets in The King's School cadet corps. In the Preparatory school, the Concert Band, Wind Ensemble and Junior Band complete the 3-12 wind bands program. The school also runs three stage bands, and numerous other jazz and chamber ensembles for Wind and Brass players. The King's School is particularly renowned for its 'Drumline', a percussion ensemble in the American tradition in which outstanding percussion students perform memorised precision drumming routines, in military-style formation.\n\nThe school has a chamber string orchestra for experienced players.\n\nThere is a non-auditioned choir for boys in the senior school, and the auditioned Schola Cantorum (Latin: meaning \"school of singers\"); both ensembles are in four vocal parts.  In the preparatory school there are three choirs consisting of trebles and altos.\n\nA number of small ensembles exist including piano trios, guitar ensembles, percussion ensembles, flute ensembles, clarinet quartet, saxophone quintet and a number of popular music bands.\n\n====Instrumental lessons====\nFull and half-period instrumental lessons are offered in piano, pipe organ, guitar, violin, viola, violoncello, contrabass, tuba, horn, trombone, trumpet, saxophone, flute, clarinet, percussion (orchestral and drum-kit), bagpipes, and voice, are available. The school has a variety of music tutors.\n\n====Regular concerts and events====\nThe Music Department conducts a number of regular events each year, including the annual [[Nine Lessons and Carols|Festival of Lessons and Carols]], Gala Concert, ensembles concerts, and studio recitals for individual performances. Most events are held in either the Recital Room (part of the Sesquicentenary music building) or Futter Hall.\n\n=== Sport ===\nSport is compulsory for all students. Senior school students must participate in one of rugby union, association football, or cross country in winter, and rowing, cricket, basketball, tennis, athletics or swimming in summer. If personally selected by the sportsmaster, students may represent the school at shooting outside their regular sporting commitments. Students may participate in a sport in which they have achieved excellence (deemed by the sportsmaster). Cricket, rugby union, association football, basketball and tennis is also available at the preparatory school. The school engages in these sports as a member of the Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales) with other schools: [[Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview|Saint Ignatius' College]], [[St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill|St Joseph's College]], [[Sydney Boys High School]], [[Sydney Grammar School]], [[Sydney Church of England Grammar School]] (Shore), [[Newington College]], [[The Scots College]] and [[The Armidale School]].\n[[File:KingsRowing1932.jpg|thumb|280px|King's School eight-oar crew, 1932]]\n\n====Rugby union====\nThe school was instrumental in the development of rugby union in Australia, playing in the first inter-school game against [[Newington College]] in 1870.

The Duke of Wellington assisted in securing royal patronage, the text of which stated that with the authority of [[King George IV]] such schools would be named \"The King's Schools\". It is said,{{by whom|date=December 2015}} although no documentation exists, that royal sanction was granted by [[King William IV]]. Two schools were opened in 1832: the first in [[Pitt Street, Sydney]], the other in George Street, [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]], {{convert|25|km}} inland. The former, opened in January, closed eight months later after the death of its first headmaster, while the Parramatta campus remained open under the stewardship of Robert Forrest, who was<!--had been? Confused about timing.--> appointed headmaster in 1831.\n\nAccording to ''The King's School 1831\u20131981'', on opening day, Monday, 13 February 1832, with a handful of pupils.<ref name=\"HistoricalSociety\">{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~jray/kings/gunther.htm |title=A short history of The King's School, Parramatta |accessdate=2007-10-22 |year =1903 |work=Australian Historical Society}}</ref> Forrest was paid a salary of \u00a3100 per annum, but it was inclusive of a land and housing grant. From fees of \u00a328 and \u00a38 per annum for boarders and day pupils respectively he was expected to maintain boarders and pay the salaries of his assistants, whose fees were \u00a34 per annum for each pupil taught. According to an article in the ''Australian Historical Society Journal'' in 1903, enrolment reached over 100 pupils before the end of the first year.<ref name=\"HistoricalSociety\"/>\n\nBy 1839, Forrest's health had deteriorated and he submitted his resignation. Ill-health caused the school to experience a rapid succession of headmasters in the following decade. William Clarke was appointed headmaster to replace Forrest, and John Troughton was appointed master in charge of boarders. Two years later W. W. Simpson became headmaster, but an epidemic of [[scarlet fever]] in 1843 forced his resignation. James Walker, a notable botanist and classical scholar, succeeded Simpson, but ill-health resulted in his resignation in December 1847.\n\nIn 1848 Forrest returned to the school, which had now had 60 pupils, but he was again forced to resign due to illness in September 1853. In July 1854, Thomas Druitt was appointed headmaster and established military drill in April 1855, a compulsory subject overseen by W. Bamford. Druitt had been under the impression that his appointment was permanent and he refused to relinquish his position upon the arrival of his replacement, Frederick Armitage, in January 1855. It was not until the intervention of Bishop [[Frederic Barker]] in May 1855 that Druitt agreed to stand down.\n\nUnder the helm of Armitage, the school experienced a protracted period of expansion in facilities and enrolments, due to his significant wealth, which allowed him to pay for many of the improvements personally.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The number of pupils increased to nearly 200, 150 of whom were boarders. Pupils studied for seven hours per day in summer and six hours in winter. As well as religious holidays, there were two official school holidays per year, including a mid-winter vacation from 15 June to 15 July, and a mid-summer vacation from 24 December to 31 January. In 1859 Armitage adopted school arms similar to those of [[The King's School Canterbury]] in England, which according to ''The King's School 1831\u20131981'', was due to the erroneous assumption that the Australian school was named after the English one. He applied for leave in 1862 to attend to his ill wife and to obtain a mathematics degree at the [[University of Cambridge]], but he never returned. By the end of his tenure, he had raised the standard and quality of education to a high level.<ref name=\"AusBiography\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Mccormack |first=Terri |encyclopedia=Australian Dictionary of Biography |title=Frederick Armitage (1827\u20131906) |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A030048b.htm |accessdate=2008-01-27 |edition=Online |year=1969 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press]] |volume=3 |location=Melbourne | pages=49}}</ref>\n\nThe acting headmaster appointed prior to Armitage's departure, LJ Trollope, saw a drastic contraction in the number of pupils to just 10 by June 1864, resulting in the closure of the school. There are varying accounts as to the reasons underpinning the school's rapid and sudden decline, including the school's poor financial situation, the dilapidated buildings and competition from other schools, while ''The King's School 1831\u20131981'' claims that it was a series of successive rainstorms causing the collapse of the schoolroom roof that forced its closure. Other accounts have blamed Armitage as lacking the discipline to continue as headmaster. The ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'' argues that while the departure of Armitage was not ideal, \"a headmastership devoid of endowment or guaranteed salary in a colonial school without a council or adequate financial support could hardly have been attractive to a scholarly English gentleman.\"<ref name=\"AusBiography\"/> The school reopened in January 1869 with George Fairfowl Macarthur as Headmaster. Macarthur had been a pupil at The King's School during its early years.\n\n== Campus ==\n{{Infobox historic site\n| name = Kings School Group (former)\n| image = Tks1890.jpg\n| caption = The King's School {{circa|1890}}\n| map_relief = yes\n| locmapin = \n| map_width = 250px\n| map_caption = Location in [[Sydney|greater metropolitan Sydney]]\n| map_dot_mark = \n| map_label = \n| coordinates = {{coord|33.80985234|151.00224321|display=inline|format=dms|type:edu_region:AU-NSW}}\n| location = 3 Marist Place, [[Parramatta]], [[Parramatta City Council]], [[New South Wales]], Australia\n| area = \n| elevation = \n| height = \n| beginning_label = Design period\n| beginning_date = \n| formed = \n| founded = \n| built = 1833&ndash;\n| built_for = \n| demolished = \n| architect = {{bulleted list|[[Ambrose Hallen]]|Blacket Brothers|Moorhouse & Isaacs|Power Adam & Munnings}}\n| architecture = [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Georgian Revival|Georgian Revival]]\n| owner = NSW Department of Health\n| designation1 = New South Wales State Heritage Register\n| designation1_offname = Heritage Office Building, Marsden Rehabilitation Centre, Laurel House, Old King's School, Old Kings School\n| designation1_type = State heritage (complex / group)\n| designation1_date = 2 April 1999\n| delisted1_date = \n| designation1_partof = \n| designation1_number = 771\n| designation1_free1name = Type\n| designation1_free1value = Education\n| designation1_free2name = Category\n| designation1_free2value = School - Private\n| designation1_free3name = Builders\n| designation1_free3value = C.

The school soon outgrew its campus in George Street, and following a submission to the Crown, it was provided with land and premises further upriver in Parramatta, close to the [[Old Government House, Parramatta|Government House]].<ref name=nswshr-771>{{cite NSW SHR|5045107|Kings School Group (former)|hr=00771|fn=14/5123; 09/2379; S93/1403|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref> The school remained there for 130 years until August 1968 when it completed its relocation to the current site in North Parramatta, originally ''Gowan Brae'', the family residence and property of [[James Burns (shipowner)|James Burns]], co-founder of [[Burns Philp and Company]]. Since the relocation, the school maintained a {{convert|147|ha|acre|adj=on}} site, while other sections of ''Gowan Brae'' were sold to [[Redeemer Baptist School]] and [[Tara Anglican School for Girls]], with as well as the NSW Synod of the Uniting Church as the Uniting Theological College.

Within the senior school, there are extensive facilities, including the Centre for Learning and Leadership, dining hall and separate buildings for visual arts, music, science, drama, agriculture, [[PDHPE]] and industrial design and technology. Futter Hall, the main school hall, and the staff centre adjacent to it are other facilities present in the academic precinct, known as 'the Quadrangle'. There are 35 classrooms, all equipped with audio-visual and computer facilities. The school theatre was renovated in June 2010, adding a second smaller theatre and drama classrooms. The school also opened its new $20&nbsp;million science centre in March 2014, which includes classrooms and labs where students can work with collaboratively with researchers from [[The University of Sydney]].\n\nSporting facilities include 15 playing fields used for both cricket and [[rugby union]], 14 tennis courts, 12 basketball courts (nine outdoor, three indoor), 7 football fields, a 50-metre lap pool, a 25-metre swimming pool, a diving pool, and a gym under which there is an indoor rifle range. The Sports Centre opened in 2007 and includes two basketball courts, a fully equipped gym and fitness centre, and PDHPE classrooms. The school also has a rowing facility in [[Putney, New South Wales|Putney]] on the Parramatta River.\n\nThere are also a number of boarding houses for students who reside at the school, and private residences adjacent to the boarding houses for teachers and their families who provide pastoral care for these boys.\n\nOther features of the school include an agricultural yard, greenhouse, a dam, vineyard, bamboo forest, a mountain biking course, and a number of heritage landmarks.\n\n== House system ==\n\n=== Senior school ===\n[[File:TKS CLL.jpg|thumb|280px|The Centre for Learning and Leadership, which includes a library, an auditorium, computer laboratories and classrooms]]\nUntil 2011 the school had [[house system|14 houses]], for both day students and boarders. The boarding houses comprised Gowan Brae, Baker, Bishop Barker, Broughton, Forrest, Hake Harris, Macarthur and Waddy, and the day student houses Britten, Burkitt, Dalmas, Kurrle, Macquarie and Wickham. In that year, the school made a number of changes to its house system, which now consists of six-day houses and five boarding houses. The boarding houses include Gowan Brae, Baker-Hake, Bishop Barker-Harris, Broughton-Forrest, Macarthur-Waddy, and the day student houses include Britten, Burkitt, Dalmas, Kurrle, Macquarie and Wickham. The houses are hubs for students' recreational and pastoral activities. During the course of a year, inter-house competitions take place where students earn points for their respective house by competing in events. The winning house at the end of the year receives the King's Cup.\n\nKurrle and Wickham were created as a result of an expansion in enrolments in 2001, and the remaining Houses have been in existence for several decades. Their names are derived from former Headmasters and Deputy Headmasters, the founder of the school (Broughton), and the traditional name of the school site (Gowan Brae).\n\n=== Preparatory school ===\nThe preparatory school has four houses: Stiles, Thomas, Blaxland and Harrison. Blaxland includes both boarders and day students, and boarders are housed within Gowan Brae, which is shared with Year 7 students. Each year there are competitions between the four houses such as athletics competitions and swimming carnivals.\n\nGowan Brae serves as an intermediate step between primary and secondary schooling, allowing Year 7 students the opportunity to adapt to the unique institutions of the senior school while remaining within a common peer group of similar age.\n\nKing's also operates a small co-educational preparatory boarding school, Tudor House, in Moss Vale, in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales 70 miles away.\n\n== Uniform ==\nThe school uniform is the oldest [[military uniform]] still worn in Australia.<ref name=\"Newsletter1\">{{Cite news|last=Hawkes|first=Timothy|publication-date=9 February 2007|year=2007|title=Celebrating 175 Years|periodical=King's Herald|publication-place=Parramatta, NSW|publisher=The King's School|issue=1|pages=1|url=http://www.kings.edu.au/documents/heralds07/herald0107.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829100630/http://www.kings.edu.au/documents/heralds07/herald0107.pdf|archivedate=29 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}.</ref> It consists of navy blue trousers with a vertical red stripe, a white shirt, black shoes, and a jacket made of a black and white woollen material, stitched in a birdseye pattern. It has red cuffs and red tabs on each side of the collar. The cuffs and epaulets are each surmounted by a braided red \"Lovers' Knot\". The uniform reflects the military history of the school, and is similar to the blazers worn at the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. \n[[File:KingsPupils1931.jpg|thumb|280px|William Archer Gunn and fellow King's students in uniform, c. 1931]]\nThe jacket may be modified in a number of ways. Military insignia can be stitched onto the right arm to show rank in the [[Australian Army Cadets]], a white lanyard may be worn by members of the Marching Band, and the Regimental Sergeant Major may wear the Coat of Arms on the left arm. Cadet Under Officers wear a different grey jacket, which has diamond lozenges on the shoulder tabs and a silver braided 'Lover's Knot'.\n\nAll students except the monitors wear one badge on a red tab on the right collar of the jacket. This is because students of lower rank would have carried rifles over one shoulder, thus damaging the additional badge, while monitors would instead be armed with pistols. House monitors wear one badge each side and school monitors wear one badge on each side with blue collar tabs. The school captain wears one crown on each blue collar tab. All the buttons are silver in colour, and are manufactured by Stokes & Sons.\n\nIn Years 11 and 12 students are allowed to wear a white pin-striped navy blue blazer (known as a ''butchers coat'') or a sky-blue \"honours blazer\". Both blazers have pockets that may have special stitching commemorating academic, sporting or cultural achievements in the form of honours, full or half colours. Outstanding achievement is rewarded by honours colours and is signified by the sky-blue blazer and gold embroidery on the blazer's pocket. Full colours are represented by white embroidery and half colours are shown by dark blue embroidery on the pocket of the pin-striped navy blue blazer.\n\nThe grey jacket and blazers must be worn with a standard black tie commemorating the death of [[Queen Victoria]] (although this was temporarily substituted in 2007 during the 175th anniversary by a navy-blue silk tie, with the King's crest and the number 175 scattered on it).\n\nThe preparatory school uniform differs slightly from that of the senior school. Students from Kindergarten to Year 2 wear navy-blue shorts with the vertical red stripe, knee-high black socks and a white pin-striped navy blue (butchers coat) blazer, while students from Years 3\u20136 wear the same shorts and socks, but with the grey blazer of the senior school.\n\n== Co-curricular activities ==\nCo-curricular activities offered by the school include debating, choir, theatre, bands and ensembles, sport, and the [[Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme]]. Clubs for senior students (the Twelve Club, the Cartesian Club, the [[Scipionic Circle]], and the Tom Barrett Society) meet once a month, to discuss the current affairs and present papers on topical issues.\n\nThe school produces at least one musical and two drama productions each year. Productions have included ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[The Mikado]]'', ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' (2015), ''Addams Family'' (2016), ''A Fleeting Night's Dream'' (2017) and  ''We Will Rock You'' (2018).{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n=== Academic clubs ===\nThe headmaster, deputy headmaster, and other senior staff host intellectual clubs composed of promising senior students. The clubs include the Twelve Club, hosted by the Headmaster, The Cartesian Club hosted by the Deputy Headmaster, the Scipionic Circle, hosted by the Director of Student Services, and the Tom Barrett Society, hosted by the school Registrar. The members of these clubs are selected for their success in areas of academics, leadership and character.\n\n=== Debating ===\nThe preparatory school competes in the IPSHA and ISDA debating competitions, and the senior school in the GPS and ISDA competitions. The school won the ISDA competition, the largest independent schools competition in NSW, for the first time in 2004. The school was represented by national and world championship winning representative teams in 2004.\n\n=== Cadet corps ===\n[[File:Tkspassingout.JPG|thumb|280px|The cadet corps's annual passing-out parade on the JS White Oval. The school chapel is in the background.]]\nFounded in 1868, the cadet corps vies with [[Newington College]]<ref>[https://archive.is/20140709094729/http://prezi.com/exobgjwkgrdf/copy-of-australian-army-cadets/ Australian Army Cadets]</ref> as the oldest<ref>http://www.lancers.org.au/site/The_Military_at_Parramatta.asp</ref> in Australia. All students in Years 9 and 10 are required to undergo cadet training, during which they are taught survival techniques, abseiling, shooting, map-reading, marching, and other skills. Each year the annual field exercise, or  \"Corps Camp\", is held at the [[Singleton, New South Wales|Singleton]] Military Area. The Corps is regarded as the largest unit from any single school, however is just surpassed by one other Unit, made up of several schools.\n\nThe Cadet Corps holds an annual passing-out parade, which commemorates the departure of the Year 12 members and the transfer of student leadership to Year 11 through the handing over of the unit colours. It is usually presided over by a high-ranking member of the [[Australian Defence Force]].\n\nThe King's School Marching Band is a central element of the cadet corps. The Band consists mainly of members of the School's Symphonic Band; it marches annually at the [[ANZAC Day]] Parade in central Sydney. The Band is overseen and directed in partnership with the Music Department, and incorporated into two platoons under the Cadet Corps command structure. There is an annual appointee to the position of Drum Major \u2013 generally a year 12 boy who demonstrates musical skill and leadership capacities.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe school has a music program that caters for a range of musical abilities, held in the sesquicentenary music building. Music at the school forms part of the curricula and co-curricula programs. The school has two pipe organs: a chapel organ in the memorial chapel and a large baroque pipe organ in Futter Hall.<ref name=SydneyOrgan>{{cite web|title=Kings School Parramatta|url=http://www.sydneyorgan.com/Kings.html|website=The Organ Music Society of Sydney|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Curriculum====\nYear 7 students complete the mandatory 100-hour [[Board of Studies]] (NSW) music course, which introduces them to basic concepts of music in a variety of styles. Year 7 boys participate in a singing program and undertake a theory exam toward the end of the year. As part of the Year 8\u201310 elective program, students can continue to study music in these years. They are required to learn an instrument as part of this course and regular performance assessments take place. For the [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|HSC]], students can continue their music studies in either the Music 1 or Music 2 courses, with the option of choosing Music Extension as well. Music 1 and 2 cover a variety of music styles, however, the Music 2 course has a focus on [[Western art music]]. Recently the school has been successful in this field, with a number of student performances and compositions nominated for ENCORE.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n====Co-curricular program====\nThe school has seven large Wind Bands, which form the core of the Wind, Brass and Percussion program. The Symphonic Band is the school's elite level band and is composed of musicians typically studying AMEB or Trinity Grade 7 and above. The Wind Orchestra is the middle ensemble within the senior school, whilst Gowan Brae Band is a special ensemble for year 7 students only, which receives extra attention and allows students to develop their talents intensively upon their arrival at King's. The marching band includes members of the Symphonic Band who are enrolled as cadets in The King's School cadet corps. In the Preparatory school, the Concert Band, Wind Ensemble and Junior Band complete the 3-12 wind bands program. The school also runs three stage bands, and numerous other jazz and chamber ensembles for Wind and Brass players. The King's School is particularly renowned for its 'Drumline', a percussion ensemble in the American tradition in which outstanding percussion students perform memorised precision drumming routines, in military-style formation.\n\nThe school has a chamber string orchestra for experienced players.\n\nThere is a non-auditioned choir for boys in the senior school, and the auditioned Schola Cantorum (Latin: meaning \"school of singers\"); both ensembles are in four vocal parts.  In the preparatory school there are three choirs consisting of trebles and altos.\n\nA number of small ensembles exist including piano trios, guitar ensembles, percussion ensembles, flute ensembles, clarinet quartet, saxophone quintet and a number of popular music bands.\n\n====Instrumental lessons====\nFull and half-period instrumental lessons are offered in piano, pipe organ, guitar, violin, viola, violoncello, contrabass, tuba, horn, trombone, trumpet, saxophone, flute, clarinet, percussion (orchestral and drum-kit), bagpipes, and voice, are available. The school has a variety of music tutors.\n\n====Regular concerts and events====\nThe Music Department conducts a number of regular events each year, including the annual [[Nine Lessons and Carols|Festival of Lessons and Carols]], Gala Concert, ensembles concerts, and studio recitals for individual performances. Most events are held in either the Recital Room (part of the Sesquicentenary music building) or Futter Hall.\n\n=== Sport ===\nSport is compulsory for all students. Senior school students must participate in one of rugby union, association football, or cross country in winter, and rowing, cricket, basketball, tennis, athletics or swimming in summer. If personally selected by the sportsmaster, students may represent the school at shooting outside their regular sporting commitments. Students may participate in a sport in which they have achieved excellence (deemed by the sportsmaster). Cricket, rugby union, association football, basketball and tennis is also available at the preparatory school. The school engages in these sports as a member of the Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales) with other schools: [[Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview|Saint Ignatius' College]], [[St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill|St Joseph's College]], [[Sydney Boys High School]], [[Sydney Grammar School]], [[Sydney Church of England Grammar School]] (Shore), [[Newington College]], [[The Scots College]] and [[The Armidale School]].\n[[File:KingsRowing1932.jpg|thumb|280px|King's School eight-oar crew, 1932]]\n\n====Rugby union====\nThe school was instrumental in the development of rugby union in Australia, playing in the first inter-school game against [[Newington College]] in 1870.

After this genre of sexploitation comedy, Mexico produced films as part of the wave of Maric\u00f3n cinema. In 2001, with the success of ''[[Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n]]'', Mexico propelled Latin America into a period of increased LGBT+ film production unified as [[New Maric\u00f3n Cinema]].\n\nWithin Mexico-specific LGBT+ cinema, a conflict of homosexuality and national identity is common and a frequent topic of analysis.\n\n== History ==\nGay characters in Mexican cinema have been said by Michael K.

In such writings, this identity goes beyond a formulation of [[machismo]] and [[Lucha libre]] to something more inherently potentially homophobic, where homosexuality is or was traditionally conceived of as not-Mexican.\n\nAlfredo Mart\u00ednez Exp\u00f3sito writes that though a \"conspicuous scarcity of gay characters and themes in Mexican cinema\" may be blamed on \"a machismo-inflected patriarchy\", the image of the homosexual is more likely controlled by \"both the image that Mexicans have formed of his own country and the image that Mexico has exported to other countries\". Mart\u00ednez Exp\u00f3sito suggests that \"cinematic attempts to introduce gay characters and themes in national cinema should necessarily be doomed\" because \"Mexicanness\" as a concept and identity contains a lot of features associated with patriarchy, which he says explains why Mexican LGBT+ cinema (pre-2001) used various strategies in order to acceptably introduce their themes; characters who are camp but not gay, characters who are closeted, for example, up until \"the latent homosexual in ''Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n''\", which he suggests \"tested the limits of national tolerance\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Mart\u00ednez Exp\u00f3sito|first=Alfredo|date=2012-12-15|title=El cine gay mexicano y su impacto en la imagen nacional.

Hendrix in 2011's ''[[La otra familia]]'' is educated on LGBT+ matters and has a representative choice to accept a foreign gay couple as his adoptive parents, implicitly a choice allowing queerness to be introduced into national identity. This film is also noted for instructionally introducing the English term \"gay\" as a modern and politically correct term to replace the extensive lexicon of gay slurs pertaining only to Mexico, and featuring exaggerated stereotypes of typical Mexican characters in Gabino and Do\u00f1a Chuy trying to reinforce ideals of machismo, homophobia, and national identity all mixed together to Hendrix.<ref name=\"maric\u00f3n\">{{cite book|title=New Maric\u00f3n Cinema: Outing Latin American Film|author=Vinodh Venkatesh|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2016|isbn=9781477310175}}</ref><sup>:188-190</sup>\n\nChristina Elaine Baker's doctoral thesis looks at Mexican [[cabaret]] and different forms of [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] as being expressions of queerness outside of the mainstream represented by film. Baker extends her scope to view the queering properties of these performances to be \"questioning not just identity constructions, but also the way the body exists in relation to the space and time within which the performances occur\", suggesting that \"the artists [...] queer, subvert and re-configure expectations of heteronormativity, the whitened [[Mestizos in Mexico|mestizo]] physique and male/female gender binaries associated with ''mexicanidad'',\" and that by using queer bodies in this way \"they propose alternative definitions of what it means to be Mexican.\" Baker notes that there is no similar representation or challenge to what constitutes national identity in Mexican film of the Golden Age, which she places as the mainstream, but that the performance appears in the LGBT+ cinema movements that succeed it, including ''fichera'' and Maric\u00f3n cinema.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Christina|date=2015|title=Queering mexicanidad in Cabaret and Film: Redefining Boundaries of Belonging|url=https://www.academia.edu/19613609|journal=University of Wisconsin - Madison|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\n== Films ==\n{{Category see also|Category:Mexican LGBT-related films}}\n{{image frame|content={{Photomontage\n |photo1a=Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (1998) (cropped).jpg\n |photo1b=Gael garcia bernal.jpg\n |photo2a=Diego Luna and Carlos Cuaron.png\n |size=\n |spacing=2\n |color=\n |color_border=\n |border=\n}}|width=210|align=right|caption=Mexican writers [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n|Alfonso]] (top left) and [[Carlos Cuar\u00f3n]] (bottom right) were nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for their 2001 film ''[[Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n]]'', which Alfonso also directed and which starred [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] (top right) and [[Diego Luna]] (bottom left).}}\nThe bisexual-themed 2001 ''[[Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n]]'' was nominated for an Oscar.<ref name=\"bfilist\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-lgbt-films-latin-america|title=10 great LGBTQ+ films from Latin America|website=BFI|accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Film title\n!Director\n!Notes\n|-\n|1938\n|''[[The House of the Ogre|La casa del ogro]]''\n|[[Fernando de Fuentes]]\n|<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\"Lonely Planet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/shop_pickandmix/free_chapters/mexico-city-3-gay-lesbian.pdf|title=Gay and Lesbian Mexico City|author=Lonely Planet|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607172340/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/shop_pickandmix/free_chapters/mexico-city-3-gay-lesbian.pdf|archivedate=June 7, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=December 5, 2009}}</ref>\n|-\n|1951\n|''[[Girls in Uniform (1951 film)|Muchachas de Uniforme]]''\n|[[Alfredo B.

In such writings, this identity goes beyond a formulation of [[machismo]] and [[Lucha libre]] to something more inherently potentially homophobic, where homosexuality is or was traditionally conceived of as not-Mexican.\n\nAlfredo Mart\u00ednez Exp\u00f3sito writes that though a \"conspicuous scarcity of gay characters and themes in Mexican cinema\" may be blamed on \"a machismo-inflected patriarchy\", the image of the homosexual is more likely controlled by \"both the image that Mexicans have formed of his own country and the image that Mexico has exported to other countries\". Mart\u00ednez Exp\u00f3sito suggests that \"cinematic attempts to introduce gay characters and themes in national cinema should necessarily be doomed\" because \"Mexicanness\" as a concept and identity contains a lot of features associated with patriarchy, which he says explains why Mexican LGBT+ cinema (pre-2001) used various strategies in order to acceptably introduce their themes; characters who are camp but not gay, characters who are closeted, for example, up until \"the latent homosexual in ''Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n''\", which he suggests \"tested the limits of national tolerance\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Mart\u00ednez Exp\u00f3sito|first=Alfredo|date=2012-12-15|title=El cine gay mexicano y su impacto en la imagen nacional.

Hendrix in 2011's ''[[La otra familia]]'' is educated on LGBT+ matters and has a representative choice to accept a foreign gay couple as his adoptive parents, implicitly a choice allowing queerness to be introduced into national identity. This film is also noted for instructionally introducing the English term \"gay\" as a modern and politically correct term to replace the extensive lexicon of gay slurs pertaining only to Mexico, and featuring exaggerated stereotypes of typical Mexican characters in Gabino and Do\u00f1a Chuy trying to reinforce ideals of machismo, homophobia, and national identity all mixed together to Hendrix.<ref name=\"maric\u00f3n\">{{cite book|title=New Maric\u00f3n Cinema: Outing Latin American Film|author=Vinodh Venkatesh|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2016|isbn=9781477310175}}</ref><sup>:188-190</sup>\n\nChristina Elaine Baker's doctoral thesis looks at Mexican [[cabaret]] and different forms of [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] as being expressions of queerness outside of the mainstream represented by film. Baker extends her scope to view the queering properties of these performances to be \"questioning not just identity constructions, but also the way the body exists in relation to the space and time within which the performances occur\", suggesting that \"the artists [...] queer, subvert and re-configure expectations of heteronormativity, the whitened [[Mestizos in Mexico|mestizo]] physique and male/female gender binaries associated with ''mexicanidad'',\" and that by using queer bodies in this way \"they propose alternative definitions of what it means to be Mexican.\" Baker notes that there is no similar representation or challenge to what constitutes national identity in Mexican film of the Golden Age, which she places as the mainstream, but that the performance appears in the LGBT+ cinema movements that succeed it, including ''fichera'' and Maric\u00f3n cinema.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Christina|date=2015|title=Queering mexicanidad in Cabaret and Film: Redefining Boundaries of Belonging|url=https://www.academia.edu/19613609|journal=University of Wisconsin - Madison|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\n== Films ==\n{{Category see also|Category:Mexican LGBT-related films}}\n{{image frame|content={{Photomontage\n |photo1a=Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (1998) (cropped).jpg\n |photo1b=Gael garcia bernal.jpg\n |photo2a=Diego Luna and Carlos Cuaron.png\n |size=\n |spacing=2\n |color=\n |color_border=\n |border=\n}}|width=210|align=right|caption=Mexican writers [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n|Alfonso]] (top left) and [[Carlos Cuar\u00f3n]] (bottom right) were nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for their 2001 film ''[[Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n]]'', which Alfonso also directed and which starred [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] (top right) and [[Diego Luna]] (bottom left).}}\nThe bisexual-themed 2001 ''[[Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n]]'' was nominated for an Oscar.<ref name=\"bfilist\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-lgbt-films-latin-america|title=10 great LGBTQ+ films from Latin America|website=BFI|accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Film title\n!Director\n!Notes\n|-\n|1938\n|''[[The House of the Ogre|La casa del ogro]]''\n|[[Fernando de Fuentes]]\n|<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\"Lonely Planet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/shop_pickandmix/free_chapters/mexico-city-3-gay-lesbian.pdf|title=Gay and Lesbian Mexico City|author=Lonely Planet|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607172340/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/shop_pickandmix/free_chapters/mexico-city-3-gay-lesbian.pdf|archivedate=June 7, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=December 5, 2009}}</ref>\n|-\n|1951\n|''[[Girls in Uniform (1951 film)|Muchachas de Uniforme]]''\n|[[Alfredo B.

In [[Atlanta]] and New York City the marches were called ''Gay Liberation Marches'', and the day of celebration was called \"Gay Liberation Day\"; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches' and the day was called \"Gay Freedom Day\". As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this homosexual behaviour into the space.\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement. Activists of a less radical nature began taking over the march committees in different cities,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kolher|first1=Will|title=June 28, 1970 \u2013 From Liberation to Pride: The 45th Anniversary of the Christopher Street Liberation Day March \u2013 Rare Video|url=http://www.back2stonewall.com/2015/06/june-28-1970-liberation-pride-45th-anniversary-christopher-street-liberation-day-march-rare-video.html|accessdate=December 11, 2017|publisher=back2stonewall.com|date=June 28, 2015}}</ref> and they dropped \"Gay Liberation\" and \"Gay Freedom\" from the names, replacing them with \"Gay Pride\".\n[[File:Chicago Pride Parade 1985 030.jpg|thumb|right|Pride march in [[Lakeview, Chicago]] in 1985]]\n\n==Description==\n[[File: Gay parade.jpg|thumb|Gay Pride Parade in New York City, 2008]]\nMany parades still have at least some of the original political or [[activism|activist]] character, especially in less accepting settings. The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\n\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\n\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community].

At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals.\n\nIn 1995 MCC, ProGay Philippines and other organizations held internal celebrations. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration. That parade culminated in \"marching by\" the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Joseph Estrada, at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park in Manila.\n\nIn 1999, Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community was born. Since then, TFP has been organizing the annual Metro Manila Pride March. In 2003, a decision was made to move the Pride March from June to the December Human Rights Week to coincide with related human rights activities such as World AIDS Day (December 1), Philippine National Lesbian Day (December 8), and International Human Rights Day (December 10).\n\nOn December 10, 2005, the First LGBT Freedom March, with the theme \"CPR: Celebrating Pride and Rights\" was held along the streets of Espa\u00f1a and Quiapo in Manila, Philippines. Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154531/http://metromanilapride.org/ Metro Manila Pride] March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\n\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July.

Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Iza\u0107' '' (Coming Out).

Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]]. There were no disruptions and the parade continued as planned.

The focal point is the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] in the city centre.

The event was attended by about forty people belonging to various homophile groups, including ones from France, Belgium, Great Britain's Gay Liberation Front, and Italy's activist homosexual rights group ''{{ill|Fuori!|it}}''.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\">{{cite book |language=Italian |last1=Rossi Barilli |first1=Gianni |title=Il movimento gay in Italia |trans-title=The Gay Movement in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2cJ1zT70ucwC |publisher=[[Feltrinelli (publisher)|Feltrinelli]] |location=Milano |year=1999 |isbn=88-07-81559-1 |oclc=801192305 |series=Universale economica}}</ref>{{rp|54\u201359}}\n\nThe first Italian event specifically associated with international celebrations of Gay Pride was the sixth congress of ''Fuori!'' held in [[Turin]] in late June 1978 and included a week of films on gay subjects.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\"/>{{rp|103}}  Episodes of violence against homosexuals were frequent in Italy, such as in the summer of 1979 when two young gay men were killed in [[Livorno]]. In [[Pisa]] in November of that year, the {{ill|Orfeo Collective|it|Collettivo Omosessuale Orfeo}} organized the first march against anti-gay violence.  Around 500 gay and lesbian participants attended, and this remained the largest gathering of the kind until 1994.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\"/>{{rp|122\u2013124}}\n\nLater, a system of \"national Pride\" observances designated one city to hold the official events, starting with Rome in 1994. Starting in 2013, the organization Onda Pride organized additional events, and in 2017 events were organized in 24 cities nationwide under its auspices.\n\n====Latvia====\n{{Main|Riga Pride and Friendship Days}}\n\nOn July 22, 2005, the first Latvian gay pride march took place in [[Riga]], surrounded by protesters. It had previously been banned by the [[Riga City Council]], and the then-[[Prime Minister of Latvia]], [[Aigars Kalv\u012btis]], opposed the event, stating Riga should \"not promote things like that\", however a court decision allowed the march to go ahead.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4708617.stm | work=BBC News | title=Latvia gay pride given go-ahead | date=July 22, 2005 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> In 2006, LGBT people in Latvia attempted a Parade but were assaulted by \"No Pride\" protesters, an incident sparking a storm of international media pressure and protests from the European Parliament at the failure of the Latvian authorities to adequately protect the Parade so that it could proceed.\n\nIn 2007, following international pressure, a Pride Parade was held once again in Riga with 4,500 people parading around [[V\u0113rmane Garden]], protected physically from \"No Pride\" protesters by 1,500 [[State Police (Latvia)|Latvian police]], with ringing the inside and the outside of the iron railings of the park. Two fire crackers were detonated with one being thrown from outside at the end of the festival as participants were moving off to the buses.

Participants included [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], [[Amnesty International]] observers and random individuals who travelled from abroad to support LGBT Latvians and their friends and families.\n\nIn 2008, the Riga Pride was held in the historically potent 11. novembra krastmala (November 11 [[Bank (geography)|Embankment]]) beneath the [[Riga Castle]]. The participants heard speeches from MEPs and a message of support from the [[President of Latvia|Latvian President]]. The embankment was not open and was isolated from the public with some participants having trouble getting past police cordons. About 300 ''No Pride'' protesters gathered on the bridges behind barricades erected by the police who kept Pride participants and the \"No Pride\" protesters separated. Participants were once more \"bused\" out but this time a 5-minute journey to central Riga.\n\nIn 2009, the annual Baltic Pride was launched, with the first edition being held in Riga with a march. This event and the following ones have been held without serious incidents.\n\nThe 2012 Baltic Pride was held on June 2nd. The parade marched through T\u0113rbatas street from the corner of \u0122ertr\u016bdes street towards V\u0113rmane Garden, where concerts and a conference were held.

The very first Gay Pride Parade in Madrid was held in June 1979 nearly four years after the death of Spain's dictator [[Francisco Franco]], with the gradual arrival of democracy and the de-criminalization of homosexuality. Since then, dozens of companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] and [[Schweppes]] and several political parties and trade unions, including [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|PODEMOS]], [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], [[Union, Progress and Democracy]], [[CCOO]] and [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores|UGT]] have been sponsoring and supporting the parade. Madrid Pride Parade is the biggest gay demonstration in Europe, with more than 1.5 million attendees in 2009, according to the [[Spanish government]].\n\nIn 2007, [[Europride]], the European Pride Parade, took place in [[Madrid]]. About 2.5 million people attended more than 300 events over one week in the Spanish capital to celebrate Spain as the country with the most developed LGBT rights in the world. Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district [[Chueca]], the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful. [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Seville]] hold also local Pride Parades. In 2008 [[Barcelona]] hosted the [[EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)|Eurogames]].\n\nIn 2014, Winter Pride Maspalomas was held for the first time at [[Maspalomas]], [[Gran Canaria, Canary Islands]], one of one Europe's most popular LGTB tourist destinations.

The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities, and the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual Gay Pride Parade.\n\nThe second biggest Pride Parade in Brazil is [[Rio de Janeiro]] Gay Pride Parade, numbering about 2 million people, traditionally taking place in [[Zona Sul]] or Rio's most affluent neighborhoods between the city center and the world-famous oceanic beaches, which usually happens in the second part of the year, when it is winter or spring in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], generally characterizing milder weather for Rio de Janeiro (about 15[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] in difference), except for occasional stormy cold fronts. The Rio de Janeiro Gay Pride Parade and its associated events are organized by the NGO Arco-\u00cdris ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''rainbow''). The group is one of the founders of the [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Gays, L\u00e9sbicas, Bissexuais, Travestis e Transexuais]] (Brazilian Association of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, Transvestites (this word used as a synonym for transgender persons in Brazil) and Transsexuals). Other Pride Parades which happen in [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] take place in [[Niter\u00f3i]], Rio de Janeiro's ex-capital in the times when Rio was the Brazilian capital and a separated [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], and [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]], where about 800,000 persons live and is located in the center of [[Baixada Fluminense]], which compose all northern suburban cities of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area numbering 3.5 million people.\n\nOther [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern Brazilian]] parades are held in [[Cabo Frio]] ([[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]), [[Campinas]] ([[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]), [[Vit\u00f3ria, Esp\u00edrito Santo|Vit\u00f3ria]] (capital of [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]]), and [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Uberaba]] ([[Minas Gerais]]). [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazilian]] parades take place in [[Curitiba]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Pelotas]], and [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-Western]] ones happen in [[Campo Grande]], [[Cuiab\u00e1]], [[Goi\u00e2nia]] and [[Bras\u00edlia]]. Across [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]], they are present in all capitals, namely, in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Aracaju]], [[Macei\u00f3]], [[Recife]], [[Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba|Jo\u00e3o Pessoa]], [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Teresina]] and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]], and also in [[Cear\u00e1]]'s [[Sert\u00e3o|hinterland]] major urban center, [[Juazeiro do Norte]].

As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this homosexual behaviour into the space.\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement. Activists of a less radical nature began taking over the march committees in different cities,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kolher|first1=Will|title=June 28, 1970 \u2013 From Liberation to Pride: The 45th Anniversary of the Christopher Street Liberation Day March \u2013 Rare Video|url=http://www.back2stonewall.com/2015/06/june-28-1970-liberation-pride-45th-anniversary-christopher-street-liberation-day-march-rare-video.html|accessdate=December 11, 2017|publisher=back2stonewall.com|date=June 28, 2015}}</ref> and they dropped \"Gay Liberation\" and \"Gay Freedom\" from the names, replacing them with \"Gay Pride\".\n[[File:Chicago Pride Parade 1985 030.jpg|thumb|right|Pride march in [[Lakeview, Chicago]] in 1985]]\n\n==Description==\n[[File: Gay parade.jpg|thumb|Gay Pride Parade in New York City, 2008]]\nMany parades still have at least some of the original political or [[activism|activist]] character, especially in less accepting settings. The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\n\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\n\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community].

At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals.\n\nIn 1995 MCC, ProGay Philippines and other organizations held internal celebrations. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration. That parade culminated in \"marching by\" the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Joseph Estrada, at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park in Manila.\n\nIn 1999, Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community was born. Since then, TFP has been organizing the annual Metro Manila Pride March. In 2003, a decision was made to move the Pride March from June to the December Human Rights Week to coincide with related human rights activities such as World AIDS Day (December 1), Philippine National Lesbian Day (December 8), and International Human Rights Day (December 10).\n\nOn December 10, 2005, the First LGBT Freedom March, with the theme \"CPR: Celebrating Pride and Rights\" was held along the streets of Espa\u00f1a and Quiapo in Manila, Philippines. Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154531/http://metromanilapride.org/ Metro Manila Pride] March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\n\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July.

Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Iza\u0107' '' (Coming Out).

Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]].

The event was attended by about forty people belonging to various homophile groups, including ones from France, Belgium, Great Britain's Gay Liberation Front, and Italy's activist homosexual rights group ''{{ill|Fuori!|it}}''.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\">{{cite book |language=Italian |last1=Rossi Barilli |first1=Gianni |title=Il movimento gay in Italia |trans-title=The Gay Movement in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2cJ1zT70ucwC |publisher=[[Feltrinelli (publisher)|Feltrinelli]] |location=Milano |year=1999 |isbn=88-07-81559-1 |oclc=801192305 |series=Universale economica}}</ref>{{rp|54\u201359}}\n\nThe first Italian event specifically associated with international celebrations of Gay Pride was the sixth congress of ''Fuori!'' held in [[Turin]] in late June 1978 and included a week of films on gay subjects.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\"/>{{rp|103}}  Episodes of violence against homosexuals were frequent in Italy, such as in the summer of 1979 when two young gay men were killed in [[Livorno]]. In [[Pisa]] in November of that year, the {{ill|Orfeo Collective|it|Collettivo Omosessuale Orfeo}} organized the first march against anti-gay violence.  Around 500 gay and lesbian participants attended, and this remained the largest gathering of the kind until 1994.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\"/>{{rp|122\u2013124}}\n\nLater, a system of \"national Pride\" observances designated one city to hold the official events, starting with Rome in 1994. Starting in 2013, the organization Onda Pride organized additional events, and in 2017 events were organized in 24 cities nationwide under its auspices.\n\n====Latvia====\n{{Main|Riga Pride and Friendship Days}}\n\nOn July 22, 2005, the first Latvian gay pride march took place in [[Riga]], surrounded by protesters. It had previously been banned by the [[Riga City Council]], and the then-[[Prime Minister of Latvia]], [[Aigars Kalv\u012btis]], opposed the event, stating Riga should \"not promote things like that\", however a court decision allowed the march to go ahead.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4708617.stm | work=BBC News | title=Latvia gay pride given go-ahead | date=July 22, 2005 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> In 2006, LGBT people in Latvia attempted a Parade but were assaulted by \"No Pride\" protesters, an incident sparking a storm of international media pressure and protests from the European Parliament at the failure of the Latvian authorities to adequately protect the Parade so that it could proceed.\n\nIn 2007, following international pressure, a Pride Parade was held once again in Riga with 4,500 people parading around [[V\u0113rmane Garden]], protected physically from \"No Pride\" protesters by 1,500 [[State Police (Latvia)|Latvian police]], with ringing the inside and the outside of the iron railings of the park. Two fire crackers were detonated with one being thrown from outside at the end of the festival as participants were moving off to the buses.

Participants included [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], [[Amnesty International]] observers and random individuals who travelled from abroad to support LGBT Latvians and their friends and families.\n\nIn 2008, the Riga Pride was held in the historically potent 11. novembra krastmala (November 11 [[Bank (geography)|Embankment]]) beneath the [[Riga Castle]]. The participants heard speeches from MEPs and a message of support from the [[President of Latvia|Latvian President]]. The embankment was not open and was isolated from the public with some participants having trouble getting past police cordons. About 300 ''No Pride'' protesters gathered on the bridges behind barricades erected by the police who kept Pride participants and the \"No Pride\" protesters separated. Participants were once more \"bused\" out but this time a 5-minute journey to central Riga.\n\nIn 2009, the annual Baltic Pride was launched, with the first edition being held in Riga with a march. This event and the following ones have been held without serious incidents.\n\nThe 2012 Baltic Pride was held on June 2nd. The parade marched through T\u0113rbatas street from the corner of \u0122ertr\u016bdes street towards V\u0113rmane Garden, where concerts and a conference were held.

The very first Gay Pride Parade in Madrid was held in June 1979 nearly four years after the death of Spain's dictator [[Francisco Franco]], with the gradual arrival of democracy and the de-criminalization of homosexuality. Since then, dozens of companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] and [[Schweppes]] and several political parties and trade unions, including [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|PODEMOS]], [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], [[Union, Progress and Democracy]], [[CCOO]] and [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores|UGT]] have been sponsoring and supporting the parade. Madrid Pride Parade is the biggest gay demonstration in Europe, with more than 1.5 million attendees in 2009, according to the [[Spanish government]].\n\nIn 2007, [[Europride]], the European Pride Parade, took place in [[Madrid]]. About 2.5 million people attended more than 300 events over one week in the Spanish capital to celebrate Spain as the country with the most developed LGBT rights in the world. Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district [[Chueca]], the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful. [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Seville]] hold also local Pride Parades. In 2008 [[Barcelona]] hosted the [[EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)|Eurogames]].\n\nIn 2014, Winter Pride Maspalomas was held for the first time at [[Maspalomas]], [[Gran Canaria, Canary Islands]], one of one Europe's most popular LGTB tourist destinations.

The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities, and the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual Gay Pride Parade.\n\nThe second biggest Pride Parade in Brazil is [[Rio de Janeiro]] Gay Pride Parade, numbering about 2 million people, traditionally taking place in [[Zona Sul]] or Rio's most affluent neighborhoods between the city center and the world-famous oceanic beaches, which usually happens in the second part of the year, when it is winter or spring in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], generally characterizing milder weather for Rio de Janeiro (about 15[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] in difference), except for occasional stormy cold fronts. The Rio de Janeiro Gay Pride Parade and its associated events are organized by the NGO Arco-\u00cdris ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''rainbow''). The group is one of the founders of the [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Gays, L\u00e9sbicas, Bissexuais, Travestis e Transexuais]] (Brazilian Association of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, Transvestites (this word used as a synonym for transgender persons in Brazil) and Transsexuals). Other Pride Parades which happen in [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] take place in [[Niter\u00f3i]], Rio de Janeiro's ex-capital in the times when Rio was the Brazilian capital and a separated [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], and [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]], where about 800,000 persons live and is located in the center of [[Baixada Fluminense]], which compose all northern suburban cities of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area numbering 3.5 million people.\n\nOther [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern Brazilian]] parades are held in [[Cabo Frio]] ([[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]), [[Campinas]] ([[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]), [[Vit\u00f3ria, Esp\u00edrito Santo|Vit\u00f3ria]] (capital of [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]]), and [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Uberaba]] ([[Minas Gerais]]). [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazilian]] parades take place in [[Curitiba]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Pelotas]], and [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-Western]] ones happen in [[Campo Grande]], [[Cuiab\u00e1]], [[Goi\u00e2nia]] and [[Bras\u00edlia]]. Across [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]], they are present in all capitals, namely, in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Aracaju]], [[Macei\u00f3]], [[Recife]], [[Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba|Jo\u00e3o Pessoa]], [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Teresina]] and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]], and also in [[Cear\u00e1]]'s [[Sert\u00e3o|hinterland]] major urban center, [[Juazeiro do Norte]].

Initially its membership was restricted only for Bulgarians. It was active not only in Macedonia but also in [[Thrace]] (the [[Vilayet of Adrianople]]). Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria,  these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between \u2018Macedonians\u2019 and \u2018Bulgarians\u2019. Moreover, as their own writings attest, they often saw themselves and their compatriots as \u2018Bulgarians\u2019 and wrote in Bulgarian standard language.

Initially its membership was restricted only for Bulgarians. It was active not only in Macedonia but also in [[Thrace]] (the [[Vilayet of Adrianople]]). Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria,  these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between \u2018Macedonians\u2019 and \u2018Bulgarians\u2019. Moreover, as their own writings attest, they often saw themselves and their compatriots as \u2018Bulgarians\u2019 and wrote in Bulgarian standard language.
