Recognizing that even a short period of incarceration can cause tremendous upheaval in one\u2019s life, including loss of employment and housing, this practice seeks to prevent incarceration solely due to a lack of financial resources and in cases where the office does not intend to seek a jail sentence.\n\n== Case Highlights ==\n\n=== 1969 Murder of Jane Britton ===\nOn November 20, 2019 District Attorney Ryan announced that under her leadership the office had successfully used DNA to identify the man responsible for the 1969 murder of Jane Britton.  The resolution of the case marked the oldest case to ever be solved by the office. \n\nMichael Sumpter, a career criminal with ties to Cambridge was ultimately identified as the person responsible for the 1969 murder of Jane Britton. Using DNA testing investigators were able to initially exclude other potential persons of interest and affirmatively identify Sumpter as the perpetrator of this crime. Sumpter has been linked to two other homicides of women in the Boston area. \n\nOn January 7, 1969 at 12:40 p.m., the body of Jane Britton, 23, of Needham, a graduate student in Anthropology at Harvard University, was found in her fourth floor apartment, located at 6 University Road, in Cambridge by her boyfriend who came to check on her after she had failed to appear to take an examination that morning. She had been sexually assaulted and struck multiple times in the head. \n\nOn January 7, 1969 a resident of Jane\u2019s apartment building reported hearing someone on the fire escape that connected to Jane\u2019s apartment earlier on the evening of her murder and a second witness account detailed that a man who appeared to be approximately 6\u2019 feet tall and 170 lbs. was seen running in the street near Jane\u2019s apartment at 1:30 a.m., Mr. Sumpter was 5\u201911\u201d and weighed 185 lbs. when he was arrested in 1972. It is believed that Mr. Sumpter entered Jane\u2019s apartment through a window, assaulted her and murdered her in her bed before fleeing the building.\n\nIn 2017 the Middlesex District Attorney\u2019s Office received several requests for the Jane Britton file to be released to the public. Although prosecutors continued to hold out hope that there might be a DNA match to the partial profile taken from the scene that might identify the person who had killed Jane Britton, the case seemed to have hit a dead end. Lacking any new information, a team of experienced investigators began a review of the file in order to potentially release some information. With fresh eyes on the file investigators also sought to determine whether there were any further investigative actions that could be taken, including consulting with the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab about whether any new advances in forensic DNA technology might be of assistance in yielding a more comprehensive evidence profile.\n\nThe decision was ultimately made to perform additional DNA testing with the most up to date testing on the remaining evidence samples. For the first time, the Massachusetts State Police Crime lab was able to obtain a Y-STR, or male-specific profile, from the remaining DNA samples on file from the original swabs in October of 2017.\n\nIn July of 2018 the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab notified the investigators that there was a match between the 2017 Y-STR profile from the evidence sample and Michael Sumpter\u2019s CODIS sample on file with the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab. Although Sumpter was already deceased, investigators were able to locate and obtain a DNA sample from Michael\u2019s biological brother who has the same male Y-STR profile. Testing on this sample excluded 99.92% of the male population as a contributor of the DNA and confirmed that Michael Sumpter\u2019s profile matched both the original soft hit and the Y-STR profile. Sumpter\u2019s brother was excluded as a possible contributor.\n\n== Controversies and criticisms ==\n\n=== Withholding exculpatory evidence ===\n\nUnder Ryan's tenure as Middlesex County District Attorney, the Office has twice been accused of withholding exculpatory evidence (evidence that might raise doubt about the accused's guilt) resulting in dropped charges after the information was eventually released.<ref name=troubling>{{Cite news |first=Yvonne |last=Abraham |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/10/17/abraham/dqBNlxrC78t6X3f44QfYIN/story.html |title=Middlesex DA's office shows troubling attitude about evidence |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=October 18, 2015 |access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref> One example stems from a \"shaken-baby\" homicide case where Aisling Brady McCarthy was accused of killing the one-year-old for whom she had been caring. She was charged after one prosecution medical expert initially concluded that the one-year-old had suffered injuries, including severe bleeding in the back of the eyes, which indicated abusive head trauma, also known as shaken baby syndrome, according to the expert.<ref name=troubling/> McCarthy was put in custody without bail following her arraignment and prior to trial.<ref name=troubling/> While investigating the case, prosecutors sought the opinion of Dr. Alex Levin, an eye specialist, on whether the injuries to the baby's eyes indicated abuse.<ref name=troubling/> In a series of phone calls starting in August 2013, Levin expressed hesitation about coming to that conclusion.<ref name=troubling/> He told prosecutors that his findings raised the possibility that the baby's injuries might have been caused by something other than abuse \u2014 an immune disorder called Job Syndrome \u2014 according to a court document.<ref name=troubling/> In spite of the fact that United States and Massachusetts Supreme Court law, Rules of Criminal Procedure, and attorneys' ethical guidelines unequivocally require that any evidence that might raise questions of guilt must immediately be turned over to the defense, Marian T. Ryan's office did not release all of the information they had on the subject for 16 months following the first phone call with Dr. Levin.<ref name=troubling/> Charges were eventually dropped, but not before McCarthy had been held without bail for over a year.

Alternative names for the highway are the '''Dakar-Ndjamena Highway''' or '''Ndjamena-Dakar Highway''' and it is '''Trans-African Highway 5''' in the [[Trans-African Highway network]].\n\nThe highway passes through seven countries and five national capitals, and links regions of similar climate and environment which have cultural and trade links going back centuries. It is one of two east\u2013west transnational links in West Africa and runs inland from and, for most of its length, roughly parallel to the [[Trans\u2013West African Coastal Highway]] with a separation of about {{convert|900|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Route and status==\n\n===Overall features, length and condition===\nThe Trans-Sahelian Highway has a length of about {{convert|4500|km|abbr=on}} running through Senegal, [[Mali]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], and the far northern tip of [[Cameroon]], ending at [[Ndjamena]] just inside the western border of [[Chad]]. All but about {{convert|775|km|0|abbr=on}}, mostly in western Mali, has been paved, but extensive sections elsewhere require rehabilitation or are currently under reconstruction.
