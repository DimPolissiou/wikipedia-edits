His death became a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' among those campaigning against [[bullying]] in [[military training]] regimes. As a result of his death a number of procedures and guidelines within the Navy's training programs were changed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Paul L.|date=June 26, 1991|title=Navy Training Safety: High-Risk Training Can be Safer|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/160/150706.pdf|journal=United States General Accounting Office|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>  He is cited by name in the Navy documentation supporting these changes.\n\n==Background==\nBoot Camp - Lee completed boot camp from Orlando Florida company C246.  This tragedy started before his entry in SAR school.   During basic swimming tests, it became clear to everyone that Lee was afraid of the water.  It took at least 5 tries to get him to pass the tread water requirements.   The company commander, BMC Treacy kept commenting \"and you are going to be a rescue swimmer my a**.   Lee told me, his rack mate, that he was terrified of the water and knew he would \"never\" make it to the Rescue Swimmer and would have to reclass.\n\nRescue Swimmer School (RSS) was a compulsory part of the training for this role.  This demanding training was developed to prepare recruits for retrieving downed aircraft carrier-based airmen under wartime conditions.  Recruits must be in peak physical condition, and the course has a 50% attrition rate.  The basic swimming skills of distance and time are tested while the student goes through Recruit Training (boot camp) and those that fail lose their guaranteed job skill training and go to the naval fleet as \"Apprentices\" with no technical jobs skills.\n\nAs part of the RSS program, recruits must successfully complete a drill known as ''sharks and daisies''. In this drill, students swim in a circle with their hands behind their backs, equipped with flippers but no safety apparatus.  Instructors take a (head) hold on the student and attempt to simulate panicking victims in need of rescue. A student failing to perform the release maneuver correctly is given additional instruction.\n\nRSS allowed for \"drop on request\" (DOR), which Mirecki had already done once, in February 1988, following failure to complete the \"sharks and daisies\" drill.  He underwent a series of physical and psychological exams and was placed on \"medical hold.\"  It is alleged that pressure from RSS instructors was behind his decision to return to the RSS program when he did.  The RSS instructors may have reminded Mirecki that his DOR request would cost him his technical skill training and send him to the naval fleet as an undesignated seaman assigned to the ship's deck force.\n\n===Mirecki's death===\nMirecki, from [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], joined the Navy in 1987.

While affiliated with both institutions, he conducted some controversial autism-related research focusing on the potential role of [[immune system]] disorders in the etiology of autism. For example, he has testified before a US congressional committee that, in his view, \"three quarters of autistic children suffer from an [[autoimmune disease]].\"\n\n==Career==\nSingh originally worked at a children's hospital in [[Vancouver]], and is the author of over 100 scientific publications. The original focus of his research was [[neurochemistry]], but his interest in the role of the immune system in neurodevelopmental disorders was sparked after reading an article on the [[mind-body relationship]], which proposed a biological mechanism to explain the signaling taking place both in the brain and in the immune system.<ref name=Latitudes>{{cite web | url=http://www.latitudes.org/articles/singh_neuro_autism.html | title=Autoimmunity and neurological disorders | publisher=ACN | date=2007 | accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> In 2004, Singh gave a talk before the [[Institute of Medicine]] in which he recommended testing for immune disorders before vaccinating children, a proposal which was declined, according to Singh, because of its high cost (almost $100 per child).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usu.edu/science/files/uploads/Insights_Fall05.pdf | title=Insights | publisher=[[Utah State University]] College of Science | date=Fall 2005 | accessdate=26 August 2013 | pages=23}}</ref> As of 2009 he was working at the Brain State International Research Center in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Singh | first1 = V.

After Harald Herlin purchased the company in 1924, he served as its [[Chairman]] until 1941. Afterwards, his son, [[Heikki H. Herlin]], took over his father's post from 1941&ndash;1987. Control of the company was then handed down to his son, Pekka Herlin, which he retained from 1987&ndash;2003. The current Chairman of KONE's Board of Directors from 2003 onwards is [[Antti Herlin]], the son of Pekka Herlin. {{As of|2019|12}}, Antti Herlin controls directly or indirectly 62% of the voting rights and 22% of the shares of the company{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} which is listed on the [[Helsinki Stock Exchange]].\n\nIn the [[Finnish language]] ''Kone'' means \"machine\" or \"device\".\n\n==History==\n\n===1910\u20131964===\nKONE (then known as Osakeyhti\u00f6 Kone Aktiebolag) was founded in 1910 as a subsidiary of Gottfr. Str\u00f6mberg Oy. Str\u00f6mberg's licence to import Graham Brothers elevators was transferred to the new company. KONE sold just a few units before terminating the licensing agreement in 1917. KONE, then a company with only 50 employees, started to make and install its own elevators in 1918. Six years later, in 1924, entrepreneur Harald Herlin bought KONE from Str\u00f6mberg and became the new chairman of the company's Board of Directors. His son, [[Heikki H. Herlin]], joined the company and was appointed technical director in 1928. His office was located in a former margarine factory on Haapaniemi Street in Helsinki that KONE had bought and converted into an elevator production facility the previous year. Heikki H. Herlin took over as KONE's president in 1932. KONE's first foreign subsidiary \u2013 AB Kone Hissar of Sweden \u2013 was established in 1957.\n\nAfter [[Finland in World War II|World War II]], KONE was called upon by the Finnish government to contribute elevators, electric hoists and cranes to the [[war reparations]] being paid to the Soviet Union. This program forced KONE to expand its capacity, rationalize production processes and learn to meet demanding manufacturing schedules. In the 1950s KONE introduced its first group controls, automatic doors and hydraulic elevators. Heikki H. Herlin turned over the president's duties in 1964 to his son, Pekka, who had served as administrative director since 1958.\n\n===1965\u20131998===\nKONE opened a purpose-built elevator factory in 1966 in [[Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4]], Finland. The following year KONE was listed on the Helsinki Exchanges and started its international expansion through the acquisition of Sweden's Asea-Graham and its Norwegian and Danish affiliates. Numerous acquisitions followed during the 1970s and 1980s with only the most significant being listed here. The acquisitions of companies larger and older than KONE itself has been seen to have brought KONE respectability and lifted the company to a position of market prominence. Eventually KONE further expanded its business scope. The company became one of the world's largest hoist and crane manufacturers as well as a producer of high-tech electronic hospital and laboratory equipment.\n\n[[File:Point HQ February 15 2009.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The former Kone corporate offices in [[Munkkiniemi]], Helsinki]]\nIn 1981 KONE entered the American elevator market with the acquisition of [[New York, NY|New York City]] based Armor Elevator Company, which it continued to operate independently as a wholly owned subsidiary.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/11/business/kone-purchases-armor-elevator.html | work=The New York Times | title=Kone Purchases Armor Elevator | date=November 11, 1981 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> The company acquired Navire Cargo Gear in 1982 and [[Robert MacGregor (engineer)|International MacGregor]], makers of shipboard cargo access equipment. Wood-handling systems and equipment for pulp and paper mills, hydraulic piping systems, mining equipment and conveyors, and specialized steel components were manufactured at KONE's steel foundry. In 1987, after 60 years as a member of KONE's board of directors and 46 as its chairman, Heikki H. Herlin retired. Prevented by Finnish law from serving simultaneously as president and board chairman, Pekka Herlin ceded the presidency to Matti Matinpalo, the first non-Herlin to occupy the position in 55 years, and continued as Chairman of the Board.\n\nIn 1990, KONE sold its shipboard cargo handling business in 1993, as well as its crane ([[Konecranes]]), wood handling and piping systems businesses in 1994, and finally the steel foundry and electronic medical instruments divisions in 1995. Only its elevators, escalators, and automatic door branches remained. KONE acquired the [[Montgomery Elevator]] Company of the U.S. in 1994. Soon afterwards, the KONE Corporation purchased a majority of the outstanding shares of O&K Rolltreppen GmbH of Germany, a supplier of escalators and [[moving walkway|autowalks]]. In 1998 the company made a $29 million (US) investment in the construction of an elevator and escalator factory in Kunshan, China.<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:MONTYLOGO.JPG|thumb]] -->\n\nIn 1996, Antti Herlin, the great-grandson of the company's founder, was appointed KONE CEO and deputy chairman of the board of the company that he had now inherited. The company introduced new technology such as the KONE EcoDisc hoisting machine and the KONE MonoSpace elevator technology concept in 1996. KONE was one of the first to introduce machine-room-less (MRL) construction in elevators. KONE's MRL designs significantly reduced the size of elevator machinery and its lift mechanism by using [[permanent-magnet electric motor]]s (PMM). The use of these mechanisms enabled all of the elevator's equipment and its inner workings to be confined to the space above the elevator shaft, known as the hoistway overhead, instead of needing an entire room dedicated to machinery. At the beginning of the 21st Century, due to the apparent benefits of KONE's pioneering elevator systems, rival companies{{which|date=April 2013}} began competitively marketing machine-room-less elevators of their own.\n\n===1999\u20132014===\n[[File:KONE Flags.jpg|250px|thumb|Flags at Kone corporate headquarters, built in 2001 in [[Keilaniemi]], [[Espoo]], [[Finland]] (photo 2003).]]\nKONEs chairman of the board, Pekka Herlin, died on April 4, 2003 after a long illness. [[Antti Herlin]] was subsequently appointed the new chairman of the board in June 2003. [[Matti Alahuhta]], a former Executive Vice President  at [[Nokia Corporation]], previously serving as the President of Nokia Mobile Phones, was later chosen to fill Herlin's vacant position as the acting President of the KONE Corporation. He held the position since 2005, and officially became the firm's President and CEO in 2006. In April 2014, Alahuhta stepped down and KONE's CFO at the time, Henrik Ehrnrooth was appointed Alahuhta's successor.\n\nIn 2000, KONE sold off the American factory in Winfield, KS to Wittur. This was done despite repeated assurances by KONE management to its employees that the factory was not for sale.\n\nIn 2002, KONE acquired Partek, a Finnish industrial engineering company with net sales equal to KONE's. Partek's business areas specialized in container handling, load handling, forest machinery and tractors. The tractors were manufactured under the [[Valtra]] brand. The KONE Materials Handling division thus comprised these Partek business areas.\n\nIn 2003, KONE decided to concentrate on Container Handling and Load Handling and the tractor and forest machine businesses were sold.  The Valtra tractor business was sold to [[AGCO]], a worldwide agricultural manufacturer. As the structure of KONE Materials Handling had changed significantly, the name KONE Cargotec was introduced in January 2004. Its business areas were Kalmar (container handling) and [[HIAB]] (load handling).\n\nAt the end of 2004, KONE Cargotec acquired MacGREGOR, a global marine cargo-flow service provider.\n\nIn August 2004 the KONE Board of Directors presented a plan to split the company into two separately listed companies on the Helsinki Stock Exchanges in June, 2005. One company would comprise KONE's existing elevator, escalator & building door service business and continue to operate under the name KONE Corporation. The other company would comprise KONE Cargotec\u2019s business area and operate under the name [[Cargotec|Cargotec Corporation]]. The Extraordinary Shareholders\u2019 Meeting in December 2004 approved the Demerger Plan. The demerger was completed in June 2005.\n\nIn September 2007 it was announced that KONE is proposing to lease several floors of a new riverfront tower to be built on Bass Street Landing, which is part of the Moline Riverfront.<ref>Schorpp, Doug.

This technology is part of the 'People Flow' family. The system also allows for the turnstiles to work together with the elevators so when you swipe your access card on the turnstile, it calls the nearest elevator. There is also an app for the elevator system that allows you to call and type in your destination from your mobile device reducing wait time.

Six years later, in 1924, entrepreneur Harald Herlin bought KONE from Str\u00f6mberg and became the new chairman of the company's Board of Directors. His son, [[Heikki H. Herlin]], joined the company and was appointed technical director in 1928. His office was located in a former margarine factory on Haapaniemi Street in Helsinki that KONE had bought and converted into an elevator production facility the previous year. Heikki H. Herlin took over as KONE's president in 1932. KONE's first foreign subsidiary \u2013 AB Kone Hissar of Sweden \u2013 was established in 1957.\n\nAfter [[Finland in World War II|World War II]], KONE was called upon by the Finnish government to contribute elevators, electric hoists and cranes to the [[war reparations]] being paid to the Soviet Union. This program forced KONE to expand its capacity, rationalize production processes and learn to meet demanding manufacturing schedules. In the 1950s KONE introduced its first group controls, automatic doors and hydraulic elevators. Heikki H. Herlin turned over the president's duties in 1964 to his son, Pekka, who had served as administrative director since 1958.\n\n===1965\u20131998===\nKONE opened a purpose-built elevator factory in 1966 in [[Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4]], Finland. The following year KONE was listed on the Helsinki Exchanges and started its international expansion through the acquisition of Sweden's Asea-Graham and its Norwegian and Danish affiliates. Numerous acquisitions followed during the 1970s and 1980s with only the most significant being listed here. The acquisitions of companies larger and older than KONE itself has been seen to have brought KONE respectability and lifted the company to a position of market prominence. Eventually KONE further expanded its business scope. The company became one of the world's largest hoist and crane manufacturers as well as a producer of high-tech electronic hospital and laboratory equipment.\n\n[[File:Point HQ February 15 2009.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The former Kone corporate offices in [[Munkkiniemi]], Helsinki]]\nIn 1981 KONE entered the American elevator market with the acquisition of [[New York, NY|New York City]] based Armor Elevator Company, which it continued to operate independently as a wholly owned subsidiary.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/11/business/kone-purchases-armor-elevator.html | work=The New York Times | title=Kone Purchases Armor Elevator | date=November 11, 1981 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> The company acquired Navire Cargo Gear in 1982 and [[Robert MacGregor (engineer)|International MacGregor]], makers of shipboard cargo access equipment. Wood-handling systems and equipment for pulp and paper mills, hydraulic piping systems, mining equipment and conveyors, and specialized steel components were manufactured at KONE's steel foundry. In 1987, after 60 years as a member of KONE's board of directors and 46 as its chairman, Heikki H. Herlin retired. Prevented by Finnish law from serving simultaneously as president and board chairman, Pekka Herlin ceded the presidency to Matti Matinpalo, the first non-Herlin to occupy the position in 55 years, and continued as Chairman of the Board.\n\nIn 1990, KONE sold its shipboard cargo handling business in 1993, as well as its crane ([[Konecranes]]), wood handling and piping systems businesses in 1994, and finally the steel foundry and electronic medical instruments divisions in 1995. Only its elevators, escalators, and automatic door branches remained. KONE acquired the [[Montgomery Elevator]] Company of the U.S. in 1994. Soon afterwards, the KONE Corporation purchased a majority of the outstanding shares of O&K Rolltreppen GmbH of Germany, a supplier of escalators and [[moving walkway|autowalks]]. In 1998 the company made a $29 million (US) investment in the construction of an elevator and escalator factory in Kunshan, China.<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:MONTYLOGO.JPG|thumb]] -->\n\nIn 1996, Antti Herlin, the great-grandson of the company's founder, was appointed KONE CEO and deputy chairman of the board of the company that he had now inherited. The company introduced new technology such as the KONE EcoDisc hoisting machine and the KONE MonoSpace elevator technology concept in 1996. KONE was one of the first to introduce machine-room-less (MRL) construction in elevators. KONE's MRL designs significantly reduced the size of elevator machinery and its lift mechanism by using [[permanent-magnet electric motor]]s (PMM). The use of these mechanisms enabled all of the elevator's equipment and its inner workings to be confined to the space above the elevator shaft, known as the hoistway overhead, instead of needing an entire room dedicated to machinery. At the beginning of the 21st Century, due to the apparent benefits of KONE's pioneering elevator systems, rival companies{{which|date=April 2013}} began competitively marketing machine-room-less elevators of their own.\n\n===1999\u20132014===\n[[File:KONE Flags.jpg|250px|thumb|Flags at Kone corporate headquarters, built in 2001 in [[Keilaniemi]], [[Espoo]], [[Finland]] (photo 2003).]]\nKONEs chairman of the board, Pekka Herlin, died on April 4, 2003 after a long illness. [[Antti Herlin]] was subsequently appointed the new chairman of the board in June 2003. [[Matti Alahuhta]], a former Executive Vice President  at [[Nokia Corporation]], previously serving as the President of Nokia Mobile Phones, was later chosen to fill Herlin's vacant position as the acting President of the KONE Corporation. He held the position since 2005, and officially became the firm's President and CEO in 2006. In April 2014, Alahuhta stepped down and KONE's CFO at the time, Henrik Ehrnrooth was appointed Alahuhta's successor.\n\nIn 2000, KONE sold off the American factory in Winfield, KS to Wittur. This was done despite repeated assurances by KONE management to its employees that the factory was not for sale.\n\nIn 2002, KONE acquired Partek, a Finnish industrial engineering company with net sales equal to KONE's. Partek's business areas specialized in container handling, load handling, forest machinery and tractors. The tractors were manufactured under the [[Valtra]] brand. The KONE Materials Handling division thus comprised these Partek business areas.\n\nIn 2003, KONE decided to concentrate on Container Handling and Load Handling and the tractor and forest machine businesses were sold.  The Valtra tractor business was sold to [[AGCO]], a worldwide agricultural manufacturer. As the structure of KONE Materials Handling had changed significantly, the name KONE Cargotec was introduced in January 2004. Its business areas were Kalmar (container handling) and [[HIAB]] (load handling).\n\nAt the end of 2004, KONE Cargotec acquired MacGREGOR, a global marine cargo-flow service provider.\n\nIn August 2004 the KONE Board of Directors presented a plan to split the company into two separately listed companies on the Helsinki Stock Exchanges in June, 2005. One company would comprise KONE's existing elevator, escalator & building door service business and continue to operate under the name KONE Corporation. The other company would comprise KONE Cargotec\u2019s business area and operate under the name [[Cargotec|Cargotec Corporation]]. The Extraordinary Shareholders\u2019 Meeting in December 2004 approved the Demerger Plan. The demerger was completed in June 2005.\n\nIn September 2007 it was announced that KONE is proposing to lease several floors of a new riverfront tower to be built on Bass Street Landing, which is part of the Moline Riverfront.<ref>Schorpp, Doug.

The system uses the 'Destination Dispatch System' which uses a touch screen panel/terminal that shows the floor numbers and when the floor is selected, it calls the nearest elevator to the floor you called the elevator from and will take you to your floor with minor to no stops on your ride to your floor. This technology is part of the 'People Flow' family. The system also allows for the turnstiles to work together with the elevators so when you swipe your access card on the turnstile, it calls the nearest elevator. There is also an app for the elevator system that allows you to call and type in your destination from your mobile device reducing wait time. The name for the elevator model that uses the 'Destination Dispatch System' is the KONE Polaris. This system has the option to have the 'KONE Monitoring System' which allows you to watch and track the turnstiles and elevator systems.\n\n===Elevators===\nThe 'KONE MonoSpace' for low- to mid-rise buildings is the world\u2019s first machine-room-less elevator.<ref name=\"kone.com\"/>\nThe 'KONE EcoSpace' elevator is a machine-room-less traction elevator designed for low-rise buildings from 2 to 15 stories as an energy-efficient alternative to hydraulic elevators, and can fit in an existing hydraulic elevator hoistway.
