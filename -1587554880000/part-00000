Circle dancing is probably the oldest known dance formation and was part of community life from when people first started to dance.\n\nDancing in a circle is an ancient [[traditional dance|tradition]] common to many cultures for marking [[Ceremony|special occasions]], [[ritual]]s, strengthening community and encouraging [[Solidarity|togetherness]]. The dance can also be enjoyed as an uplifting group experience or as part of a [[meditation]]. Circle dances are choreographed to many different [[music genres|styles of music]] and rhythms.\n\nUnlike [[line dancing]], circle dancers are in physical contact with each other; the [[connection (dance)|connection]] is made by [[handhold (dance)|hand-to-hand]], finger-to-finger or hands-on-shoulders. It is a type of dance where anyone can join in without the need of [[partner dance|partner]]s. Generally, the participants follow a leader around the dance floor while holding the hand of the dancers beside them. The dance can be gentle or energetic.\n\nModern circle dance mixes traditional [[folk dance]]s, mainly from European or [[Near East]]ern sources, with recently choreographed ones to a variety of music both ancient and modern. There is also a growing repertoire of new circle dances to [[classical music]] and [[pop music|contemporary songs]].<ref name=gilbert>International Folk Dance at a Glance. Second Edition. Cecile Gilbert. Burgess Publishing Company. 1974. ISBN 8087-0727-2</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n\nModern circle dancing is found in many cultures, including [[Arab culture|Arabic]] ([[Levant]]ian and [[music of Iraq|Iraqi]]),  [[Culture of Israel|Israeli]] (see [[Jewish dance]] and [[Israeli folk dancing]]), [[Assyrian folk dance|Assyrian]], [[Kurdish dance|Kurdish]], [[Turkish dance|Turkish]], [[Armenian dance|Armenian]], [[Azerbaijani folk music|Azerbaijani]], [[Culture of Malta|Maltese]], and [[Balkan]] (such as [[culture of Albania|Albanian]], Bosnian, [[Bulgarian dances|Bulgarian]], [[Croatian dances|Croatian]], [[Greek dances|Greek]] and [[Serbian dances|Serbian]]). Despite its immense reputation in the Middle East and [[southeast Europe]], circle dancing also has a historical prominence in [[Brittany]], [[Catalonia]] and [[Irish dance|Ireland]] to the [[Western Europe|west of Europe]], and also in [[South America]] ([[Culture of Peru|Peruvian]]), [[Tibetan culture|Tibet]], and with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (see [[ghost dance]]).

The dancers hold each other's hands and the circle spins, usually counterclockwise, as each participant follows a sequence of three steps forward and one step back. The Hora is popular during wedding [[party|celebrations]] and [[festival]]s, and is an essential part of the social entertainment in rural areas. In [[Bulgaria]], it is not necessary to be in a circle; a curving line of people is also acceptable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forward.com/articles/12226/hora-history-/ |title='Hora' History |website=forward.com |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Kolo====\n\nThe [[kolo (dance)|Kolo]] is a collective [[folk dance]] common in various [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] regions, such as [[Serbia]], named after the circle formed by the dancers.

The dance was originally from the [[Empord\u00e0]] region, but started gaining popularity throughout Catalonia during the 20th century.

The dance originated from the medieval times, which survived only in the Faroe Islands, while in other European countries it was banned by the church, due to its [[pagan]] origin. The dance is danced traditionally in a circle, but when a lot of people take part in the dance they usually let it swing  around in various wobbles within the circle. The dance in itself only consists in holding each other's hands, while the dancers form a circle, dancing two steps to the left and one to the right without crossing the legs. When more and more dancers join the dance ring, the circle starts to bend and forms a new one within itself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Faroese Chain Dance |url=https://www.faroeislands.fo/arts-culture/customs/chain-dance/ |publisher=Faroe Islands.fo |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Sacred Circle Dance====\n{{further|Sacred dance}}\n\nThe Sacred Circle Dance was brought to the [[Findhorn Foundation]] community in [[Scotland]] by [[Bernhard Wosien]]; he presented traditional circle dances that he had gathered from across [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>Watts, 2006. pages 6\u201310</ref> \nColin Harrison and David Roberts and Janet Rowan Scott took the dances to other parts of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] where they started regular groups in south east [[England]] and [[Somerset]], then across [[Europe]], the US and elsewhere.

It consists of a ''lawweeh'' ({{lang|ar|\u0644\u0648\u064a\u062d}}) at the head of a group of men holding hands and formed in a semicircle. The lawweeh is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step, and when the singers finish their song the lawweeh breaks from the semicircle to dance on their own. The lawweeh is the most popular and familiar form of dabke danced for happy family celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sourat.com/dabke.htm |title=Dabke: The Dance of the Lebanese Village |publisher=Sourat |accessdate=2010-10-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918072739/http://www.sourat.com/dabke.htm |archivedate=2012-09-18 }}</ref>\n\n====Khigga====\n[[File:Assyriankhigga.jpg|thumb|[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] dancing khigga at a festival]]\n\n[[Khigga]] is the one of main styles of [[Assyrian folk dance]] in which multiple dancers hold each other's hands and form a line or a circle.

Circle dancing is probably the oldest known dance formation and was part of community life from when people first started to dance.\n\nDancing in a circle is an ancient [[traditional dance|tradition]] common to many cultures for marking [[Ceremony|special occasions]], [[ritual]]s, strengthening community and encouraging [[Solidarity|togetherness]]. The dance can also be enjoyed as an uplifting group experience or as part of a [[meditation]]. Circle dances are choreographed to many different [[music genres|styles of music]] and rhythms.\n\nUnlike [[line dancing]], circle dancers are in physical contact with each other; the [[connection (dance)|connection]] is made by [[handhold (dance)|hand-to-hand]], finger-to-finger or hands-on-shoulders. It is a type of dance where anyone can join in without the need of [[partner dance|partner]]s. Generally, the participants follow a leader around the dance floor while holding the hand of the dancers beside them. The dance can be gentle or energetic.\n\nModern circle dance mixes traditional [[folk dance]]s, mainly from European or [[Near East]]ern sources, with recently choreographed ones to a variety of music both ancient and modern. There is also a growing repertoire of new circle dances to [[classical music]] and [[pop music|contemporary songs]].<ref name=gilbert>International Folk Dance at a Glance. Second Edition.

The dancers hold each other's hands and the circle spins, usually counterclockwise, as each participant follows a sequence of three steps forward and one step back.

The dance originated from the medieval times, which survived only in the Faroe Islands, while in other European countries it was banned by the church, due to its [[pagan]] origin. The dance is danced traditionally in a circle, but when a lot of people take part in the dance they usually let it swing  around in various wobbles within the circle. The dance in itself only consists in holding each other's hands, while the dancers form a circle, dancing two steps to the left and one to the right without crossing the legs. When more and more dancers join the dance ring, the circle starts to bend and forms a new one within itself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Faroese Chain Dance |url=https://www.faroeislands.fo/arts-culture/customs/chain-dance/ |publisher=Faroe Islands.fo |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Sacred Circle Dance====\n{{further|Sacred dance}}\n\nThe Sacred Circle Dance was brought to the [[Findhorn Foundation]] community in [[Scotland]] by [[Bernhard Wosien]]; he presented traditional circle dances that he had gathered from across [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>Watts, 2006. pages 6\u201310</ref> \nColin Harrison and David Roberts and Janet Rowan Scott took the dances to other parts of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] where they started regular groups in south east [[England]] and [[Somerset]], then across [[Europe]], the US and elsewhere.

A small centrepiece of flowers or other objects is often placed at the centre of the circle to help focus the dancers and maintain the circular shape.

It consists of a ''lawweeh'' ({{lang|ar|\u0644\u0648\u064a\u062d}}) at the head of a group of men holding hands and formed in a semicircle. The lawweeh is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step, and when the singers finish their song the lawweeh breaks from the semicircle to dance on their own. The lawweeh is the most popular and familiar form of dabke danced for happy family celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sourat.com/dabke.htm |title=Dabke: The Dance of the Lebanese Village |publisher=Sourat |accessdate=2010-10-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918072739/http://www.sourat.com/dabke.htm |archivedate=2012-09-18 }}</ref>\n\n====Khigga====\n[[File:Assyriankhigga.jpg|thumb|[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] dancing khigga at a festival]]\n\n[[Khigga]] is the one of main styles of [[Assyrian folk dance]] in which multiple dancers hold each other's hands and form a line or a circle.

There are multiple foot patterns that dancers perform. The head of the khigga line usually dances with an handkerchief with beads and bells added to the sides so it jingles when shaken.

The Verizon Building was designed in the [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco style]] by [[Ralph Thomas Walker|Ralph Walker]] of the firm [[Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker]], and was Walker's first major commission as well as one of the first Art Deco skyscrapers. It occupies the entire block bounded by West Street to the west, Barclay Street to the north, [[Vesey Street]] to the south, and [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]] to the east, abutting the [[World Trade Center (2001\u2013present)|World Trade Center]]. \n\nThe Verizon Building was constructed from 1923 to 1927 as the Barclay\u2013Vesey Building. It served as the longtime [[corporate headquarters]] of [[New York Telephone]] and its successor [[Verizon Communications]]. The building, being adjacent to the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|original World Trade Center]] to the south and [[7 World Trade Center]] to the east, experienced major damage in the [[September 11 attacks]] following the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]]. Restoration of the building and damaged communications infrastructure after the attacks took three years and cost $1.4 billion. Part of the building was converted into residential [[Condominium|condominiums]] in 2016.\n\nThe Verizon Building was built to have an imposing form, with vertical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] designed as [[Buttress|buttresses]]; [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] at upper floors; and a program of elaborate ornamentation on the exterior and interior. The Verizon Building's design has been widely praised by architectural critics, both for its design scheme and for its symbolism.

To keep out the water and slime-like earth, the builders erected a [[cofferdam]] with 22 [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]].

The superstructure incorporated {{Convert|20,000|ST|LT t|abbr=}} of steel across its above-ground and below-ground sections, and the builders used six derricks to lift the girders from the street. Four temporary stairways, each containing 351 steps, were built to facilitate the construction of the upper floors.

The Verizon Building was designed in the [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco style]] by [[Ralph Thomas Walker|Ralph Walker]] of the firm [[Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker]], and was Walker's first major commission as well as one of the first Art Deco skyscrapers. It occupies the entire block bounded by West Street to the west, Barclay Street to the north, [[Vesey Street]] to the south, and [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]] to the east, abutting the [[World Trade Center (2001\u2013present)|World Trade Center]]. \n\nThe Verizon Building was constructed from 1923 to 1927 as the Barclay\u2013Vesey Building. It served as the longtime [[corporate headquarters]] of [[New York Telephone]] and its successor [[Verizon Communications]]. The building, being adjacent to the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|original World Trade Center]] to the south and [[7 World Trade Center]] to the east, experienced major damage in the [[September 11 attacks]] following the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]]. Restoration of the building and damaged communications infrastructure after the attacks took three years and cost $1.4 billion. Part of the building was converted into residential [[Condominium|condominiums]] in 2016.\n\nThe Verizon Building was built to have an imposing form, with vertical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] designed as [[Buttress|buttresses]]; [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] at upper floors; and a program of elaborate ornamentation on the exterior and interior. The Verizon Building's design has been widely praised by architectural critics, both for its design scheme and for its symbolism.

To keep out the water and slime-like earth, the builders erected a [[cofferdam]] with 22 [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]].

The superstructure incorporated {{Convert|20,000|ST|LT t|abbr=}} of steel across its above-ground and below-ground sections, and the builders used six derricks to lift the girders from the street. Four temporary stairways, each containing 351 steps, were built to facilitate the construction of the upper floors.

Delta subsequently regained all the Terminal A gates and began building up operations again in the mid 2010s, culminating in the reestablishing of BOS as a hub in 2019.\n*[[Detroit Metropolitan Airport|Detroit]] \u2013 Inherited through the [[Delta Air Lines-Northwest Airlines merger|merger with Northwest]], Detroit serves as one of Delta's two Midwest hubs and is Delta's second largest overall. It is the primary Asian gateway for the Eastern United States and it also provides service to many destinations in the Americas and Europe.\n*[[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]] \u2013 Delta's secondary West Coast hub. Delta inherited its LAX hub from [[Western Airlines]], but dismantled it in the mid-1990s, opting to relocate most of those aircraft to the east coast. Since then, it has re-opened the hub, offering service to select cities in Latin America, Asia, Australia and Europe, as well as major domestic cities and West Coast regional destinations.\n*[[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] \u2013 Inherited through the [[Delta Air Lines-Northwest Airlines merger|merger with Northwest]], Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul serves as one of Delta's two Midwest hubs and is Delta's third largest overall. It is the primary Canadian gateway for the airline while also including many American metropolitan destinations, a number of regional destinations in the upper Midwest as well as some select destinations in Europe and Asia.\n* [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York\u2013JFK]] \u2013  Delta's primary transatlantic hub. Delta inherited its JFK hub from its partnership with Pan Am after Pan Am's collapse in 1991. The hub also offers service on many transcontinental \"prestige routes\" to west coast destinations such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n*[[LaGuardia Airport|New York\u2013LaGuardia]] \u2013 Delta's second New York hub. This important domestic hub was created as a result of a slot swap with the now defunct [[US Airways]]. Delta's service at LaGuardia covers numerous East Coast US cities, and a number of regional destinations in the US and Canada.\n*[[Salt Lake City International Airport|Salt Lake City]] \u2013 Inherited through the [[Western Airlines|merger with Western Airlines]], Salt Lake City serves as the fourth largest hub for the airline. Delta service covers most major US destinations as well as a number of regional destinations in the US, with an emphasis on the Rocky Mountain region, as well as select destinations in Canada, Mexico, and select cities in Europe and Hawaii.\n*[[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport|Seattle/Tacoma]] \u2013 Delta's primary West Coast hub. The hub serves as an international gateway to Asia for the Western United States. Delta service also includes many major US destinations as well as regional destinations in the Pacific Northwest. Delta started aggressively building its presence in Seattle in 2011, and announced SEA's hub status in 2014, while notably sparking tensions with Seattle-based Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"airchive.com\">{{cite web |url=http://airchive.com/blog/2014/06/17/delta-launches-seattle-hong-kong/ |title=Delta Launches Seattle-Hong Kong, and Seattle Hub -

Also during the late 1980s and early 1990s, [[CRT display|CRT]] monitors over the aisles were added to the 757 fleet, making them the first narrowbody aircraft to feature video entertainment. The MD-90 introduced Delta's first [[In-flight entertainment|IFE system]] with [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitors in 1995, and the 777 introduced Delta's first in-seat video system in 1999, initially using the [[Rockwell Collins]] Total Entertainment System. Delta's first all-digital IFE system with AVOD (Panasonic eFX) was first introduced in 2003 on Delta's former low-cost subsidiary, Song. The Rockwell Collins IFE system on the 777s was replaced by the Panasonic eFX system in 2007, followed by the Panasonic eX2 in 2011.

The new livery consists of four colors, while the old one (called \"colors in motion\") used eight.

In addition, PreKote reduces water usage by two-thirds and reduces wastewater treatment.\n\nPreKote is also saving money by reducing the time needed to paint each airplane. With time savings of eight to ten percent, it will save an estimated more than $1 million annually.<ref name=\"Delta Air Lines News Release\">{{cite web|title=Delta Air Lines Accepts EPA Award for Use of Nontoxic Materials on Aircraft|url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&item=22|work=Delta Air Lines News Release|publisher=Delta Air Lines|accessdate=March 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929110225/http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&item=22|archive-date=September 29, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n===Deltalina===\n{{Main|Deltalina}}\nAs part of the re-branding project, a [[safety video]] featuring a flight attendant showed up on YouTube in early 2008, getting over 1 million views and the attention of news outlets, specifically for the video's tone mixed with the serious safety message.

These were installed in some Delta aircraft. Some early wide-bodied aircraft, including the [[Lockheed L-1011]], [[Boeing 767-200#767-200|Boeing 767-200]], and [[767-300#767-300|Boeing 767-300]] fleet, had movies projected onto the cabin bulkhead. Also during the late 1980s and early 1990s, [[CRT display|CRT]] monitors over the aisles were added to the 757 fleet, making them the first narrowbody aircraft to feature video entertainment. The MD-90 introduced Delta's first [[In-flight entertainment|IFE system]] with [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitors in 1995, and the 777 introduced Delta's first in-seat video system in 1999, initially using the [[Rockwell Collins]] Total Entertainment System. Delta's first all-digital IFE system with AVOD (Panasonic eFX) was first introduced in 2003 on Delta's former low-cost subsidiary, Song. The Rockwell Collins IFE system on the 777s was replaced by the Panasonic eFX system in 2007, followed by the Panasonic eX2 in 2011. The Panasonic eFX and eX2 systems are trademarked by Delta as \"Delta on Demand\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.delta.com/delta-brings-award-winning-flight-experience-skies-new-%E2%80%9Csky360%C2%B0-delta%E2%80%9D-new-york-city | title=Delta Brings Award-Winning In-Flight Experience from the Skies to the New \"SKY360\u00b0 by Delta\" in New York City | publisher=Delta Air Lines | date=October 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 2010, Delta installed the Panasonic eFX AVOD system in Economy on six 767-300ERs that are used on routes that are 12 hours or longer.<ref name=\"flyertalk.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/delta-skymiles/1007665-767-international-fleet-seating-update.html |title=767 International Fleet seating update |publisher=Flyertalk.com |accessdate=July 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723175955/http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/delta-skymiles/1007665-767-international-fleet-seating-update.html |archive-date=July 23, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Delta also announced it would be installing AVOD in Economy class on all Boeing 767-300ER and 747 aircraft over the next 3 years.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delta-to-invest-in-customer-experience-fleet-efficiency-82600907.html | title=Delta to Invest in Customer Experience, Fleet Efficiency | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=January 25, 2010 | access-date=July 27, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721014954/https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delta-to-invest-in-customer-experience-fleet-efficiency-82600907.html | archive-date=July 21, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn July 27, 2010, Delta announced that it would be the launch customer of the new eX2 AVOD system with the Eco 9i Integrated Smart Monitor, a new ultra-lightweight IFE system by Panasonic Avionics Corporation and [[Zodiac Seats U.S.]]<ref name=\"panasonic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/runway-girl/2010/07/delta-air-lines-to-launch-pana.html |title=BREAKING: Delta Air Lines to launch Panasonic's Fusion (Smart!!!) |work=Flight International |accessdate=July 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730173402/http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/runway-girl/2010/07/delta-air-lines-to-launch-pana.html |archivedate=July 30, 2010 }}</ref> The systems have been installed on the entire 747-400 fleet as of October 2012, and are currently being installed on the 767-300ER fleet (except for the six aircraft previously retrofitted with the eFX system in 2010).<ref name=\"ifec\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/07/28/345502/delta-to-launch-integrated-ifecseat-from-panasonic.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102211511/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/delta-to-launch-integrated-ifecseat-from-panasonic-345502/ |archivedate=November 2, 2011 |title=Delta to launch integrated IFEC/seat from Panasonic, Weber |work=Flight International |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> A different version of the Integrated Smart Monitor developed by Panasonic Avionics Corporation and [[BE Aerospace]] was installed on the Airbus A330 fleet.

This coincided with the introduction of passenger screening using metal detectors in U.S. airports starting in the late 1960s.\n* On July 31, 1972, [[Delta Flight 841]], a Detroit to Miami DC-8 flight, was hijacked to [[Algiers, Algeria]] by 8 hijackers. The aircraft stopped in Boston to pick up an international navigator. The flight was allowed to return with passengers to the U.S., stopping in Barcelona for refueling.<ref name=\"nbc\">{{cite news|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=465514|title=Delta Hijacking|work=[[NBC Nightly News]]|publisher=Vanderbilt Television News Archive|date=August 1, 1972|accessdate=January 31, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010051353/http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=465514|archive-date=October 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19720731-0&lang=en|title=ASN Aircraft accident McDonnell Douglas DC-8 Algiers|publisher=Aviation-safety.net|accessdate=March 1, 2009|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66UDVH6K1?url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19720731-0|archive-date=March 27, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* On February 22, 1974, [[Samuel Byck]], an unemployed tire salesman from Pennsylvania, shot and killed an Aviation Police Officer, then stormed aboard [[Delta Air Lines Flight 523]], a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 flight at Baltimore Friendship Airport (now [[Baltimore\u2013Washington International Airport]]) scheduled to fly to Atlanta, and shot both pilots, killing the First Officer, Fred Jones.

Therefore, the concept of supply-chain risk management, which is cause-oriented, is often combined with the concept of supply-chain resilience, which aims to ensure that the supply chain can bounce back from risks irrespective of their cause. Supply chain resilience is therefore \"The adaptive capability of the supply chain to prepare for unexpected events, respond to\ndisruptions, and recover from them by maintaining continuity of operations at the desired level of connectedness and control over structure and function\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ponomarov |first1=Serhiy Y. |last2=Holcomb |first2=Mary C. |title=Understanding the concept of supply chain resilience |journal=International Journal of Logistics Management |date=2009 |volume=20 |issue=1 |page=124\u2013143 |doi=10.1108/09574090910954873}}</ref>\n\n== Time to recover ==\nAn important metric originally introduced by Cisco and adopted by the SCRLC is called \"time to recover\" (TTR<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scrlc.com/newsletter-readMore.php?aID=132|title=SCRLC|website=www.scrlc.com|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref>).  TTR is the time it takes a company to restore 100% of operational output following a major supply-chain disruption.  The determination of TTR assumes that the facility is essentially unusable due to a major event, and would need extensive repairs and reconstruction, as well as re-sourcing and re-qualifying of key equipment used in manufacturing and other operations.\n\n== Measuring risk ==\nSupply-chain risk is a function of likelihood of an event's occurrence and its impact.  Generally this is the most popular methodology for quantifying risk.  The drawback of using this to compute supply-chain risk, is that it requires assessing likelihood or probability of many different event types for n number of supply-chain locations (which can be hundreds of thousands of locations).  Thus, the range of different possibilities is very wide.  This methodology is generally more appropriate for a smaller subset of site(s).  Most companies look at measuring risk using risk scores.  Many different metrics are available.  For example, financial risk score, operational risk score, resiliency score (R Score), etc. are easily acquired, easily analyzed and can be used effectively and understood easily.\n\n== Managing risk proactively ==\nA survey in 2011 conducted by BCI and Zurich for over 559 companies across 65 countries found that over 85% of companies had suffered at least one supply-chain disruption during the year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20111102/NEWS06/111109973/Majority-of-companies-suffered-supply-chain-disruption-in-2011-Survey|title=Majority of companies suffered supply-chain disruption in 2011: Survey - Business Insurance|work=Business Insurance|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref>  The respondents also noted that 40% of the reported disruptions originated in a sub-tier supplier and not their direct supplier.\n\n== Contingency options ==\nSome options to engineer an acceptable risk level include:\n*Managing stock\n*Considering alternative sourcing arrangements\n*Business interruption / contingency insurance\n*Risk assessments and audits\n*Awareness campaigns and training programs\n*The use of business intelligence from big data analytics and continuous monitoring for predictive security measures vs. clean up\n*Redundancy optimization\n*Postponement\n*Collaboration<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=Christopher S.|date=2006|title=Robust strategies for mitigating supply chain disruptions.|url=|journal=International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201345|doi=10.1080/13675560500405584|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Supply-chain security]]\n* [[Cybersecurity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Books==\n* Choi, T.M., C.H.

Supply chain resilience is therefore \"The adaptive capability of the supply chain to prepare for unexpected events, respond to\ndisruptions, and recover from them by maintaining continuity of operations at the desired level of connectedness and control over structure and function\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ponomarov |first1=Serhiy Y. |last2=Holcomb |first2=Mary C. |title=Understanding the concept of supply chain resilience |journal=International Journal of Logistics Management |date=2009 |volume=20 |issue=1 |page=124\u2013143 |doi=10.1108/09574090910954873}}</ref>\n\n== Time to recover ==\nAn important metric originally introduced by Cisco and adopted by the SCRLC is called \"time to recover\" (TTR<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scrlc.com/newsletter-readMore.php?aID=132|title=SCRLC|website=www.scrlc.com|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref>).  TTR is the time it takes a company to restore 100% of operational output following a major supply-chain disruption.  The determination of TTR assumes that the facility is essentially unusable due to a major event, and would need extensive repairs and reconstruction, as well as re-sourcing and re-qualifying of key equipment used in manufacturing and other operations.\n\n== Measuring risk ==\nSupply-chain risk is a function of likelihood of an event's occurrence and its impact.  Generally this is the most popular methodology for quantifying risk.  The drawback of using this to compute supply-chain risk, is that it requires assessing likelihood or probability of many different event types for n number of supply-chain locations (which can be hundreds of thousands of locations).  Thus, the range of different possibilities is very wide.  This methodology is generally more appropriate for a smaller subset of site(s).  Most companies look at measuring risk using risk scores.  Many different metrics are available.  For example, financial risk score, operational risk score, resiliency score (R Score), etc. are easily acquired, easily analyzed and can be used effectively and understood easily.\n\n== Managing risk proactively ==\nA survey in 2011 conducted by BCI and Zurich for over 559 companies across 65 countries found that over 85% of companies had suffered at least one supply-chain disruption during the year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20111102/NEWS06/111109973/Majority-of-companies-suffered-supply-chain-disruption-in-2011-Survey|title=Majority of companies suffered supply-chain disruption in 2011: Survey - Business Insurance|work=Business Insurance|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref>  The respondents also noted that 40% of the reported disruptions originated in a sub-tier supplier and not their direct supplier.\n\n== Contingency options ==\nSome options to engineer an acceptable risk level include:\n*Managing stock\n*Considering alternative sourcing arrangements\n*Business interruption / contingency insurance\n*Risk assessments and audits\n*Awareness campaigns and training programs\n*The use of business intelligence from big data analytics and continuous monitoring for predictive security measures vs. clean up\n*Redundancy optimization\n*Postponement\n*Collaboration<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=Christopher S.|date=2006|title=Robust strategies for mitigating supply chain disruptions.|url=|journal=International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201345|doi=10.1080/13675560500405584|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Supply-chain security]]\n* [[Cybersecurity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Books==\n* Choi, T.M., C.H.
