It was released as the second single from their third studio album, ''[[Of the Blue Colour of the Sky]]'', in January 2010. The band took the unorthodox route of creating two official music videos for the song, both of which premiered on [[YouTube]].   The first features a live performance of the song in collaboration with the [[University of Notre Dame]] Marching Band.  The second features a giant [[Rube Goldberg machine]], constructed to operate in time with the song. The popularity of the second music video of the song has been compared to that of the band's video for \"[[Here It Goes Again]]\", helping to boost live performances and single song sales for the group but not significantly improving sales of the ''Colour'' album. Difficulties with [[EMI]], their corporate label, in marketing and distribution of the videos led the band to form their own independent label shortly after the videos' releases.\n\n==Song==\nThe lyrics to \"This Too Shall Pass\" are written to encourage its audience, burdened with some figurative weight, to \"let it go, this too shall pass\" in the near future instead of continuing to let the weight keep them from enjoying life, akin to the meaning of the [[This too shall pass|original phrase, ''This too shall pass'']]. The song continues much of the theme of ''Of the Blue Colour of the Sky'', which, according to [[Damian Kulash]], was about \"searching for hope in hopeless times\"; \"This Too Shall Pass\" and other songs from the album were written at the onset of the [[late-2000s recession]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.expressnightout.com/content/2010/05/ok-go-930-club.php | title = Viral Return: OK Go at the 9:30 Club | work = [[Washington Post]] | date = 2010-05-05 | accessdate = 2010-05-05 | first = Paul | last = Stelter |archive-url=http://archive.fo/txZYF|archive-date=29 Sep 2013}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' considered the song to be a \"psych-pop anthem\", similar to [[MGMT]]'s \"[[Kids (MGMT song)|Kids]]\";<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1069816/ok-go-of-the-blue-colour-of-the-sky | title = OK Go, \"Of the Blue Colour of the Sky\" | first = Mikael | last = Wood | date = 2010-01-29 | accessdate = 2010-04-30 | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | publisher = [[Prometheus Global Media]] }}</ref> this is in part due to the album's producer [[Dave Fridmann]] who had also worked with MGMT and [[The Flaming Lips]] and brought some of the same musical stylings along.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/articles/ok-go-of-the-blue-colour-of-the-sky,36878/ | title = Of The Blue Colour Of The Sky | publisher = [[The A.V.

Directed by Brian L. Perkins, it was filmed in October, 2009, in [[South Bend, Indiana]].  The video is somewhat unusual in that it does not feature the album version of the song.  Rather, it features an original recording that was actually performed live during filming of the video. OK Go's Tim Nordwind noted that the song lent itself well to large orchestration.<ref name=\"ign video\">{{cite web | url = http://music.ign.com/articles/107/1075158p1.html | title = OK Go Interview | first = Brian | last = Linder | date = 2010-03-08 | accessdate = 2010-03-08 | publisher = IGN | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100408194846/http://music.ign.com/articles/107/1075158p1.html | archivedate = 2010-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nIn the video, the members of OK Go are seen in a field wearing marching band garb. The uniforms were originally from [[Rochelle Township High School]] of [[Rochelle, Illinois]]. They begin to march and, as the song progresses, the band is joined by members of the [[University of Notre Dame]]'s Marching Band many of whom rise up camouflaged in [[ghillie suits]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fredonialeader.com/reverb/ok-go-s-viral-tendencies-stymied-by-emi-1.1219973 | title = Ok Go's \u2018viral\u2019 tendencies stymied by EMI | first = Ned | last = Campbell | work = The Fredonia Leader | date = 2010-03-03 | accessdate = 2010-03-03 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100307041118/http://www.fredonialeader.com/reverb/ok-go-s-viral-tendencies-stymied-by-emi-1.1219973 | archivedate = 2010-03-07 }}</ref>  They are also joined in the final chorus by a children's choir cobbled together from two local South Bend preschools.<ref name=\"spin interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.spin.com/2010/01/qa-ok-gos-damian-kulash/ | title = Q&A: OK Go's Damian Kulash | first = David | last = Marchese | date = 2010-01-12 | accessdate = 2010-05-13 | work = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | publisher = [[Spin Media]] }}</ref>  Like many of their other videos, the marching band video was shot in one take.\n\nThe marching band video was created to bridge the time between the release of the album and the expected completion of the Rube Goldberg video. The band had originally planned to release the marching band version after the debut of the Rube Goldberg video. However, they found time during October 2009 to work with the Notre Dame band, and realizing the length of time to complete the Rube Goldberg machine, went ahead and completed the marching band version.<ref name=\"ign video\"/>\n\n==Second music video: Rube Goldberg Machine==\nThe second music video for \"This Too Shall Pass\" was directed by James Frost. Similar to the band's video for \"[[Here It Goes Again]]\", the \"This Too Shall Pass\" video features a four-minute, apparent [[One shot (music video)|one shot]] sequence of the song being played in time to the actions of a giant [[Rube Goldberg machine]] built in a two-story warehouse from over 700 household objects, traversing an estimated half-mile course.<ref name=\"wired video\"/><ref name=\"timesonline\"/> As the song and machine operate, the members of the band are seen singing alongside the machine, with the members being shot at by [[paint gun]]s at the song's finale. Parts of the machine are synchronized in time with the music; in one instance, glasses of water are used to repeat part of the song's melody in the fashion of a [[glass harp]]. One part of the machine shows the \"Here It Goes Again\" video on a television before it is smashed by the machine.<ref name=\"wired video\"/> The [[Make (magazine)|MAKE magazine]] 1993 [[Ford Escort (North America)|Ford Escort]] [[racecar]], used for the [[24 Hours of LeMons]], appears in the video along with a miniature [[LEGO]] version of the car.<ref name=\"boingboing\">{{cite web | url = http://www.boingboing.net/2010/03/02/ok-gos-rube-goldberg.html | title = OK Go's Rube Goldberg music video | first = Mark | last = Frauenfelder | date = 2010-03-02 | accessdate = 2010-03-04 | publisher = [[Boing Boing]] }}</ref><ref name=\"Jalopnik\">{{cite web | url = http://jalopnik.com/5485731/lemons-racer-appears-in-ok-go-rube-goldberg-video | title = LeMons Racer Appears In OK Go Rube Goldberg Video | first = Wes | last = Siler | date = Mar 4, 2010 | accessdate = Mar 5, 2010 | publisher = [[Jalopnik]] }}</ref> Alongside the LEGO car, several LEGO mini-figurines are displayed as a reference to the marching band video.<ref name=\"nasa\"/>\n\n===Creation===\n[[File:This too shall pass floor plan.jpg|thumb|right|The floor plan for the Rube Goldberg machine used in the video covered two floors of a warehouse and had several distinct stations that worked in time with the music.]]\nThe video's inspiration was from the band, who wanted \"a giant machine that we dance with\", a long-term aspiration of the band and inspired by other Rube Goldberg machines shown in videos on YouTube, including the interstitials used on the Japanese children's show ''[[PythagoraSwitch]]''.<ref name=\"wired video\">{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/03/ok-go-rube-goldberg/ | title = How OK Go\u2019s Amazing Rube Goldberg Machine Was Built | first=  Dylan F. | last = Tweney | date = 2010-03-02 | accessdate = 2010-03-03 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | publisher = [[Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications|Cond\u00e9 Nast]] }}</ref><ref name=\"mtv video\"/><ref name=\"ew video\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20352354,00.html | title = Ok Go: How'd They Do That?

The first day of filming included 47 takes, none of which successfully completed the entire machine and necessitated a second day of filming.<ref name=\"timesonline\"/> Many of the takes ended only 30 seconds into the process, at the start of the song's chorus, where a tire would fail to roll properly into the next section of the machine. Syyn Labs had a group of 30 people to help reset the machine after each failed take, a process that took upwards of an hour depending on how far the machine ran.<ref name=\"wired video\"/> There were no significant injuries during filming; Tim Nordwind once was hit hard with paint at the end,<ref name=\"ew video\"/> while the Steadicam operator nearly got hit with one of the barrels at the end of the mechanism in the shot used for the final video.  His reaction may be seen in the released version of the video.<ref name=\"make qa\"/>\n\nSeveral elements of the machine had to be properly adjusted to match the timing for the song. The group broke the song into sections, triggered when the machine passed certain gates, to account for small changes in timing that could occur (up to 0.5 sec, according to [[Brett Doar]], one of the machine's chief designers), allowing the band to continue to [[lip synch]] while the machine operated.<ref name=\"make qa\">{{cite web | url = http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/03/ok_go_rube_goldberg_video_meet_the.html | title = OK Go Rube Goldberg video: meet the makers! | first = Becky | last = Stern | date = 2010-03-05 | accessdate = 2010-03-07 | work = [[Make (magazine)|MAKE magazine]] | publisher = Maker Media | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100307101608/http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/03/ok_go_rube_goldberg_video_meet_the.html | archivedate = 2010-03-07 }}</ref> Smaller objects like dominoes were found to be the trickiest to set, as their patterns would be less predictable than larger and bulkier objects, which are more predominant in the later parts of the machine.<ref name=\"mtv video\"/> Once the machine transitioned to the downstairs portion, it would generally run the rest of the course untouched.<ref name=\"make qa\"/> Furthermore, the time of day and temperature would play a big factor in how some small components would behave, forcing the team to readjust the timing.<ref name=\"mtv video\"/> Ball tracks and other features had to be wiped clear of dust and debris to prevent slowing down rolling objects.<ref name=\"wired video\"/> A carved wooden ball track shown early in the video was created to have motions timed to the music, but required a low inclined angle that would often cause the balls to skip out of the tracks.<ref name=\"wired video\"/>\n\nKulash noted that their largest \"nightmare\" for the machine was a set of mousetraps, triggered to release a display of colored flags; they were found to be overly sensitive to earlier actions of the machine, such as the dropping of a piano, and redesign and padding were needed to prevent the traps from being set off prematurely.<ref name=\"mtv video\"/> The timing had to take into account the movements of both the band members and the cameraman; Damien Kulash estimated that though the machine was able to complete its opening at least three times, these shots were botched, because either the band members or the cameraman had fallen behind the action of the machine.<ref name=\"mtv video\">{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633096/20100303/ok_go.jhtml | title=OK Go Take You Behind  Eye-Popping 'This Too Shall Pass' Video | date  =2010-03-03 |accessdate = 2010-03-03 | first = James | last = Montgomery | work = [[MTV]] | publisher = [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] }}</ref>\n\nWhile the video was filmed as a single shot on at least three different occasions, they planned on using post-editing to slow down or speed up certain parts of the take to keep it in time with the final soundtrack.<ref name=\"make qa\"/> There is a noted cut in the video, in which the camera passes through a set of curtains on the transition to the downstairs portion of the machine; according to one of the machine designers, Hector Alvarez, this cut was introduced by the band, speculating it was introduced to avoid a shot of one of the band members or cameraman in frame or otherwise to keep the machine video synchronized to the machine.<ref name=\"make qa\"/> Both Tim Nordwind, bassist for the band, and [[Adam Sadowsky]], president of Syyn Labs, said that while the machine worked in its entirety 3 times, and no cut was needed, the decision was made so a better result on the downstairs portion could be included in the final version.

Because of deals between the band's label, [[EMI]] (through [[Capitol Records]]), and [[YouTube]], the video was not embeddable, nor was it viewable across the globe, frustrating many fans and music industry professionals who wanted to post the video on their blogs. The band, led by singer Damian Kulash, explained the label's rationale via the band's blog and through an op-ed piece in ''[[The New York Times]]''.  According to Kulash, EMI disallowed the embeddable play of the video because they only receive royalties for views on the YouTube site itself. He further pleaded to allow embedding of their next video, citing a 90% drop in viewership when EMI disabled embedding on existing videos, affecting the band's own royalties from viewership.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/opinion/20kulash.html | title = WhoseTube?  | first  = Damien | last = Kulash Jr. | date = 2010-02-19 | accessdate = 2010-03-03 | work = [[New York Times]] | publisher = [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]] }}</ref><ref name=\"rs emi\">{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/02/22/ok-go-explain-viral-video-woes-in-new-york-times-op-ed/ | title = OK Go Explain Viral Video Woes in \"New York Times\" Op-Ed | first=  Daniel | last = Kreps | date = 2010-02-22 | accessdate = 2010-03-03 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/02/02/ok-go-struggle-with-labels-rules-banning-embedded-video/ | title = OK Go Struggle With Label\u2019s Rules Banning Embedded Video | first=  David | last = Browne | date = 2010-02-02 | accessdate = 2010-03-03 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | publisher = [[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] }}</ref>\n\nThe band was able to secure the rights to allow the \"This Too Shall Pass\" Rube Goldberg video to be distributed via embedding prior to its premiere, in part due to funding support from [[State Farm Insurance]], which helped to settle issues with EMI;<ref name=\"ign video\"/><ref name=\"rs video\"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nbclosangeles.com/entertainment/music/OK-Go-Unleashes-Rube-Goldberg-Machine-in-Echo-Park-86017552.html | title = Science Rocks: OK Go Unleashes Rube Goldberg Machine | first = Jonathan | last = Lloyd | date = 2010-03-02 | accessdate = 2010-03-03 | work = [[KNBC]] }}</ref> in exchange, State Farm had some say in the creative process, and the video includes elements with the State Farm logo, including a toy truck that is used to start the machine.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/brandnewday/archives/2010/03/ok_go_state_far.html | title=  Inside the OK Go / State Farm Deal | first = Helen | last = Walters | work = [[Business Week]] | date = 2010-03-03 | accessdate = 2010-03-24 }}</ref> The video was completed a week later than expected; according to sources close to the band, Capitol Records considered the window of opportunity for promoting the single to radio to be closed due to the delay, and would not be available again until June 2010.<ref name=\"nymag\">{{cite web | url = http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/65588/ | title = World of Wonder | first = Chris | last = Williams | date = 2010-04-25 | accessdate = 2010-04-29 | work = [[New York Magazine]] }}</ref>  The band has since decided to break away from the EMI label on amiable terms, due to a combination of the issues of video embedding and radio promotions, and has become its own independent recording label, [[Paracadute|Paracadute Recordings]].<ref name=\"baltsun\">{{cite web | url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/music/bs-ae-music-ok-go-20100507,0,2429460.story | title = OK Go sets out on its own | work = [[Baltimore Sun]] | date = 2010-05-07 | accessdate = 2010-05-05 | first = Sam | last = Sessa|archive-url=http://archive.fo/lgx7O|archive-date=17 Jan 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"nymag\"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-live-0316-ok-go-main-20100316,0,5243912.column | title = OK Go goes independent | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = 2010-03-16 | accessdate = 2010-03-16 | first = Steve | last = Johnson | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100323003313/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-live-0316-ok-go-main-20100316,0,5243912.column | archive-date = 2010-03-23 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Track listings==\n\n===CD Single===\n\n#This Too Shall Pass\n#This Too Shall Pass (Instrumental)\n#This Too Shall Pass (Sunday Hangover [[Passion Pit]] Remix)\n\n===CD Remix EP===\n\n#This Too Shall Pass (Passion Pit Remix)\n#This Too Shall Pass (Shoes Remix)\n#This Too Shall Pass ([[Ra Ra Riot]] Remix)\n#This Too Shall Pass (J.

It was released as the second single from their third studio album, ''[[Of the Blue Colour of the Sky]]'', in January 2010. The band took the unorthodox route of creating two official music videos for the song, both of which premiered on [[YouTube]].   The first features a live performance of the song in collaboration with the [[University of Notre Dame]] Marching Band.  The second features a giant [[Rube Goldberg machine]], constructed to operate in time with the song. The popularity of the second music video of the song has been compared to that of the band's video for \"[[Here It Goes Again]]\", helping to boost live performances and single song sales for the group but not significantly improving sales of the ''Colour'' album. Difficulties with [[EMI]], their corporate label, in marketing and distribution of the videos led the band to form their own independent label shortly after the videos' releases.\n\n==Song==\nThe lyrics to \"This Too Shall Pass\" are written to encourage its audience, burdened with some figurative weight, to \"let it go, this too shall pass\" in the near future instead of continuing to let the weight keep them from enjoying life, akin to the meaning of the [[This too shall pass|original phrase, ''This too shall pass'']]. The song continues much of the theme of ''Of the Blue Colour of the Sky'', which, according to [[Damian Kulash]], was about \"searching for hope in hopeless times\"; \"This Too Shall Pass\" and other songs from the album were written at the onset of the [[late-2000s recession]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.expressnightout.com/content/2010/05/ok-go-930-club.php | title = Viral Return: OK Go at the 9:30 Club | work = [[Washington Post]] | date = 2010-05-05 | accessdate = 2010-05-05 | first = Paul | last = Stelter |archive-url=http://archive.fo/txZYF|archive-date=29 Sep 2013}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' considered the song to be a \"psych-pop anthem\", similar to [[MGMT]]'s \"[[Kids (MGMT song)|Kids]]\";<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1069816/ok-go-of-the-blue-colour-of-the-sky | title = OK Go, \"Of the Blue Colour of the Sky\" | first = Mikael | last = Wood | date = 2010-01-29 | accessdate = 2010-04-30 | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | publisher = [[Prometheus Global Media]] }}</ref> this is in part due to the album's producer [[Dave Fridmann]] who had also worked with MGMT and [[The Flaming Lips]] and brought some of the same musical stylings along.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/articles/ok-go-of-the-blue-colour-of-the-sky,36878/ | title = Of The Blue Colour Of The Sky | publisher = [[The A.V.

Directed by Brian L. Perkins, it was filmed in October, 2009, in [[South Bend, Indiana]].  The video is somewhat unusual in that it does not feature the album version of the song.  Rather, it features an original recording that was actually performed live during filming of the video. OK Go's Tim Nordwind noted that the song lent itself well to large orchestration.<ref name=\"ign video\">{{cite web | url = http://music.ign.com/articles/107/1075158p1.html | title = OK Go Interview | first = Brian | last = Linder | date = 2010-03-08 | accessdate = 2010-03-08 | publisher = IGN | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100408194846/http://music.ign.com/articles/107/1075158p1.html | archivedate = 2010-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nIn the video, the members of OK Go are seen in a field wearing marching band garb. The uniforms were originally from [[Rochelle Township High School]] of [[Rochelle, Illinois]]. They begin to march and, as the song progresses, the band is joined by members of the [[University of Notre Dame]]'s Marching Band many of whom rise up camouflaged in [[ghillie suits]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fredonialeader.com/reverb/ok-go-s-viral-tendencies-stymied-by-emi-1.1219973 | title = Ok Go's \u2018viral\u2019 tendencies stymied by EMI | first = Ned | last = Campbell | work = The Fredonia Leader | date = 2010-03-03 | accessdate = 2010-03-03 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100307041118/http://www.fredonialeader.com/reverb/ok-go-s-viral-tendencies-stymied-by-emi-1.1219973 | archivedate = 2010-03-07 }}</ref>  They are also joined in the final chorus by a children's choir cobbled together from two local South Bend preschools.<ref name=\"spin interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.spin.com/2010/01/qa-ok-gos-damian-kulash/ | title = Q&A: OK Go's Damian Kulash | first = David | last = Marchese | date = 2010-01-12 | accessdate = 2010-05-13 | work = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | publisher = [[Spin Media]] }}</ref>  Like many of their other videos, the marching band video was shot in one take.\n\nThe marching band video was created to bridge the time between the release of the album and the expected completion of the Rube Goldberg video. The band had originally planned to release the marching band version after the debut of the Rube Goldberg video. However, they found time during October 2009 to work with the Notre Dame band, and realizing the length of time to complete the Rube Goldberg machine, went ahead and completed the marching band version.<ref name=\"ign video\"/>\n\n==Second music video: Rube Goldberg Machine==\nThe second music video for \"This Too Shall Pass\" was directed by James Frost. Similar to the band's video for \"[[Here It Goes Again]]\", the \"This Too Shall Pass\" video features a four-minute, apparent [[One shot (music video)|one shot]] sequence of the song being played in time to the actions of a giant [[Rube Goldberg machine]] built in a two-story warehouse from over 700 household objects, traversing an estimated half-mile course.<ref name=\"wired video\"/><ref name=\"timesonline\"/> As the song and machine operate, the members of the band are seen singing alongside the machine, with the members being shot at by [[paint gun]]s at the song's finale. Parts of the machine are synchronized in time with the music; in one instance, glasses of water are used to repeat part of the song's melody in the fashion of a [[glass harp]].

The first day of filming included 47 takes, none of which successfully completed the entire machine and necessitated a second day of filming.<ref name=\"timesonline\"/> Many of the takes ended only 30 seconds into the process, at the start of the song's chorus, where a tire would fail to roll properly into the next section of the machine. Syyn Labs had a group of 30 people to help reset the machine after each failed take, a process that took upwards of an hour depending on how far the machine ran.<ref name=\"wired video\"/> There were no significant injuries during filming; Tim Nordwind once was hit hard with paint at the end,<ref name=\"ew video\"/> while the Steadicam operator nearly got hit with one of the barrels at the end of the mechanism in the shot used for the final video.

The group broke the song into sections, triggered when the machine passed certain gates, to account for small changes in timing that could occur (up to 0.5 sec, according to [[Brett Doar]], one of the machine's chief designers), allowing the band to continue to [[lip synch]] while the machine operated.<ref name=\"make qa\">{{cite web | url = http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/03/ok_go_rube_goldberg_video_meet_the.html | title = OK Go Rube Goldberg video: meet the makers! | first = Becky | last = Stern | date = 2010-03-05 | accessdate = 2010-03-07 | work = [[Make (magazine)|MAKE magazine]] | publisher = Maker Media | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100307101608/http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/03/ok_go_rube_goldberg_video_meet_the.html | archivedate = 2010-03-07 }}</ref> Smaller objects like dominoes were found to be the trickiest to set, as their patterns would be less predictable than larger and bulkier objects, which are more predominant in the later parts of the machine.<ref name=\"mtv video\"/> Once the machine transitioned to the downstairs portion, it would generally run the rest of the course untouched.<ref name=\"make qa\"/> Furthermore, the time of day and temperature would play a big factor in how some small components would behave, forcing the team to readjust the timing.<ref name=\"mtv video\"/> Ball tracks and other features had to be wiped clear of dust and debris to prevent slowing down rolling objects.<ref name=\"wired video\"/> A carved wooden ball track shown early in the video was created to have motions timed to the music, but required a low inclined angle that would often cause the balls to skip out of the tracks.<ref name=\"wired video\"/> \n\nKulash noted that their largest \"nightmare\" for the machine was a set of mousetraps, triggered to release a display of colored flags; they were found to be overly sensitive to earlier actions of the machine, such as the dropping of a piano, and redesign and padding were needed to prevent the traps from being set off prematurely.<ref name=\"mtv video\"/> The timing had to take into account the movements of both the band members and the cameraman; Damien Kulash estimated that though the machine was able to complete its opening at least three times, these shots were botched, because either the band members or the cameraman had fallen behind the action of the machine.<ref name=\"mtv video\">{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633096/20100303/ok_go.jhtml | title=OK Go Take You Behind  Eye-Popping 'This Too Shall Pass' Video | date  =2010-03-03 |accessdate = 2010-03-03 | first = James | last = Montgomery | work = [[MTV]] | publisher = [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] }}</ref>\n\nWhile the video was filmed as a single shot on at least three different occasions, they planned on using post-editing to slow down or speed up certain parts of the take to keep it in time with the final soundtrack.<ref name=\"make qa\"/> There is a noted cut in the video, in which the camera passes through a set of curtains on the transition to the downstairs portion of the machine; according to one of the machine designers, Hector Alvarez, this cut was introduced by the band, speculating it was introduced to avoid a shot of one of the band members or cameraman in frame or otherwise to keep the machine video synchronized to the machine.<ref name=\"make qa\"/> Both Tim Nordwind, bassist for the band, and [[Adam Sadowsky]], president of Syyn Labs, said that while the machine worked in its entirety 3 times, and no cut was needed, the decision was made so a better result on the downstairs portion could be included in the final version.

Because of deals between the band's label, [[EMI]] (through [[Capitol Records]]), and [[YouTube]], the video was not embeddable, nor was it viewable across the globe, frustrating many fans and music industry professionals who wanted to post the video on their blogs. The band, led by singer Damian Kulash, explained the label's rationale via the band's blog and through an op-ed piece in ''[[The New York Times]]''.  According to Kulash, EMI disallowed the embeddable play of the video because they only receive royalties for views on the YouTube site itself. He further pleaded to allow embedding of their next video, citing a 90% drop in viewership when EMI disabled embedding on existing videos, affecting the band's own royalties from viewership.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/opinion/20kulash.html | title = WhoseTube?  | first  = Damien | last = Kulash Jr. | date = 2010-02-19 | accessdate = 2010-03-03 | work = [[New York Times]] | publisher = [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]] }}</ref><ref name=\"rs emi\">{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/02/22/ok-go-explain-viral-video-woes-in-new-york-times-op-ed/ | title = OK Go Explain Viral Video Woes in \"New York Times\" Op-Ed | first=  Daniel | last = Kreps | date = 2010-02-22 | accessdate = 2010-03-03 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/02/02/ok-go-struggle-with-labels-rules-banning-embedded-video/ | title = OK Go Struggle With Label\u2019s Rules Banning Embedded Video | first=  David | last = Browne | date = 2010-02-02 | accessdate = 2010-03-03 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | publisher = [[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] }}</ref>\n\nThe band was able to secure the rights to allow the \"This Too Shall Pass\" Rube Goldberg video to be distributed via embedding prior to its premiere, in part due to funding support from [[State Farm Insurance]], which helped to settle issues with EMI;<ref name=\"ign video\"/><ref name=\"rs video\"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nbclosangeles.com/entertainment/music/OK-Go-Unleashes-Rube-Goldberg-Machine-in-Echo-Park-86017552.html | title = Science Rocks: OK Go Unleashes Rube Goldberg Machine | first = Jonathan | last = Lloyd | date = 2010-03-02 | accessdate = 2010-03-03 | work = [[KNBC]] }}</ref> in exchange, State Farm had some say in the creative process, and the video includes elements with the State Farm logo, including a toy truck that is used to start the machine.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/brandnewday/archives/2010/03/ok_go_state_far.html | title=  Inside the OK Go / State Farm Deal | first = Helen | last = Walters | work = [[Business Week]] | date = 2010-03-03 | accessdate = 2010-03-24 }}</ref> The video was completed a week later than expected; according to sources close to the band, Capitol Records considered the window of opportunity for promoting the single to radio to be closed due to the delay, and would not be available again until June 2010.<ref name=\"nymag\">{{cite web | url = http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/65588/ | title = World of Wonder | first = Chris | last = Williams | date = 2010-04-25 | accessdate = 2010-04-29 | work = [[New York Magazine]] }}</ref>  The band has since decided to break away from the EMI label on amiable terms, due to a combination of the issues of video embedding and radio promotions, and has become its own independent recording label, [[Paracadute|Paracadute Recordings]].<ref name=\"baltsun\">{{cite web | url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/music/bs-ae-music-ok-go-20100507,0,2429460.story | title = OK Go sets out on its own | work = [[Baltimore Sun]] | date = 2010-05-07 | accessdate = 2010-05-05 | first = Sam | last = Sessa|archive-url=http://archive.fo/lgx7O|archive-date=17 Jan 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"nymag\"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-live-0316-ok-go-main-20100316,0,5243912.column | title = OK Go goes independent | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = 2010-03-16 | accessdate = 2010-03-16 | first = Steve | last = Johnson | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100323003313/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-live-0316-ok-go-main-20100316,0,5243912.column | archive-date = 2010-03-23 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Track listings==\n\n===CD Single===\n\n#This Too Shall Pass\n#This Too Shall Pass (Instrumental)\n#This Too Shall Pass (Sunday Hangover [[Passion Pit]] Remix)\n\n===CD Remix EP===\n\n#This Too Shall Pass (Passion Pit Remix)\n#This Too Shall Pass (Shoes Remix)\n#This Too Shall Pass ([[Ra Ra Riot]] Remix)\n#This Too Shall Pass (J.

Cats hiss when they are startled, scared, angry, or in pain, and also to scare off intruders into their territory. If the hiss and growl warning does not remove the threat, an attack by the cat may follow. Kittens as young as two to three weeks will hiss and spit when first picked up by a human. \"Spitting\" is a shorter but louder and more emphatic version of hissing.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n[[file:Lion_raring-sound1TamilNadu178.ogg|right|thumb|Familiar lion's roar recorded from a big cat in captivity.]]\n\n=== Howl, yowl, moan, and wail ===\nThese sounds are commonly used during threatening situations.

Others may be only a single behavioural change (as perceived by humans) such as slowly blinking to signal relaxation.\n\nDomestic cats frequently use visual communication with their eyes, ears, mouths, tails, coats and body postures.

Its breathing is slow to normal, with legs bent, or hind legs laid out or extended.  The tail is loosely wrapped, extended, or held up. It also hangs down loosely when the cat is standing. When cats are calm, they tend to stand relaxed with a still tail.  \n*'''Stretching posture''' \u2013 another posture indicating the cat is relaxed. When cats lie on their back with their belly exposed, they are in a position of vulnerability.  Therefore, this position may communicate a feeling of trust<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Andrew|title=Feline Behaviour and Welfare|date=2012|publisher=C.A.B. International|location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK|pages=58}}</ref> or comfort; however, cats may also roll onto their back to defend themselves with their claws, or to bask in areas of bright sunlight.\n*'''Yawning posture''' \u2013 either by itself, or in conjunction with a stretch: another posture of a relaxed cat.  Having the mouth open and no teeth exposed indicates playfulness.<ref>{{cite book|title=Communicating with your cat|first=J.

Its back is almost horizontal when standing and moving. Its breathing is normal, with its legs bent or extended (when standing). Its tail is curved back or straight upwards, and there may be twitching while the tail is positioned downwards.\n*'''Tense posture''' \u2013 The cat is lying on its belly, with the back of its body lower than its upper body (slinking) when standing or moving back. Its hind legs are bent and front legs are extended when standing. Its tail is close to the body, tensed or curled downwards; there can be twitching when the cat is standing up.\n*'''Anxious/ovulating posture''' \u2013 The cat is lying on its belly. The back of the body is more visibly lower than the front part when the cat is standing or moving. Its breathing may be fast, and its legs are tucked under its body. The tail is close to the body and may be curled forward (or close to the body when standing), with the tip of the tail moving up and down (or side to side).\n*'''Fearful posture''' \u2013 The cat is lying on its belly or crouching directly on top of its paws. Its entire body may be shaking and very near the ground when standing up. Breathing is also fast, with its legs bent near the surface, and its tail curled and very close to its body when standing on all fours.  A fearful, defensive cat makes itself smaller, lowers itself toward the ground, arches its back and leans its body away from the threat rather than forward.  Fighting usually occurs only when escape is impossible.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n*'''Confident posture''' \u2013 The cat may walk around in a more comfortable manner with its tail up to the sky indicating their importance. Cats often walk through houses with their tail standing up high above them making them look grander and more elegant.\n*'''Terrified posture''' \u2013 The cat is crouched directly on top of its paws, with visible shaking seen in some parts of the body. Its tail is close to the body, and it can be standing up, together with its hair at the back. The legs are very stiff or even bent to increase their size. Typically, cats avoid contact when they feel threatened, although they can resort to varying degrees of aggression when they feel cornered, or when escape is impossible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reading Your Cat|url=http://animal.discovery.com/cat-guide/cat-behavior/reading-your-cat.html|publisher=Animal Planet|accessdate=22 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121232348/http://animal.discovery.com/cat-guide/cat-behavior/reading-your-cat.html|archivedate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n*'''Aggressive posture''' \u2013 The hind legs stiffen, the rump elevates but the back stays flat, tail hairs are erected, the nose is pushed forward and the ears are pulled back slightly.  Because cats have both claws and teeth, they can easily cause injury if they become involved in a fight, so this posture is an attempt to elicit deference by a competitor without fighting.  The aggressor may attempt to make challengers retreat and will pursue them if they do not flee. \n\n[[File:Abby playing in basket.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[tortoiseshell cat]] with erect hairs on its tail and back which in this context indicates excitement or curiosity]]\n\n===Ears===\nCats can change the position of their ears very quickly, in a continuum from erect when the cat is alert and focused, slightly relaxed when the cat is calm, and flattened against the head when extremely defensive or aggressive.<ref name=\"catwatch\" /> In cats, flattened ears generally indicate that an individual feels threatened and may attack.\n\nFlattening of the ears is also a biological adaptation for stalking prey in grass or in a hiding place where the cat's erect ears would give away its position.\n\n===Eyes===\nA direct stare by a cat usually communicates a challenge or threat and is more likely to be seen in high-ranking cats; lower-ranking cats usually withdraw in response.<ref name=\"Miller\" /> The direct stare is often used during [[predation]] or for territorial reasons.\n\nIn contrast to a direct stare, cats will lower their eyelids or slowly blink them to show trust and affection to their owners. According to Gary Weitzman, a licensed veterinarian and animal author, this type of feline body language is similar to a \"kitty kiss\". He further explains in his book, \"How To Speak Cat: A Guide to Decoding Cat Language,\" that slow blinking could be a physiological response to lowered stress hormonal levels from being in a calm state.\n\n\"The slow blink really is an acceptance gesture,\" Weitzman says. \"They do that when they're absolutely comfortable with you, and they do it with other cats as well.\" It is not clear why cats do this when they are feeling calm and comfortable, but Weitzman writes, \"it's likely an autonomic response \u2026 having to do with the cat having its cortisol [stress hormone] levels down.\"\n\nIn fact, Weitzman encourages cat owners to mimic this behavior to return not only a message of affection, but one that reinforces a nonthreatening position. This behavior is not exclusive to domestic house cats. Since cats can be very territorial, in the wild they utilize this slow blinking with other cats to signal themselves as friendly or nonthreatening.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How to speak cat : a guide to decoding cat language|last=Alexander|first=Newman, Aline|others=Weitzman, Gary|isbn=9781426318634|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=880756959|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Tail===\nCats often use their tails to communicate. A cat holding its tail vertically generally indicates positive emotions such as happiness or confidence; the vertical tail is often used as a friendly greeting toward human beings or other cats (usually close relatives).  A half-raised tail can indicate less pleasure, and unhappiness is indicated with a tail held low. In addition, a cat's tail may swing from side to side.  If this motion is slow and \"lazy\", it generally indicates that the cat is in a relaxed state.  Cats will twitch the tip of their tail when hunting or when otherwise alert or playful. Abrupt, full-tail twitching indicates a state of indecision.<!-- This isn't relevant to the scope of this article, but the example Morris uses is a cat who steps outside and discovers it's raining.

This tail behavior is also seen when a cat has become \"irritated\" and is nearing the point of lashing out, typically by biting or swatting with claws extended.  A cat may also twitch its tail when playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iams.com/iams/pet-health/cat-body-language.jsp|title=Cat articles on Iams website|publisher=|access-date=2009-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225152840/http://www.iams.com/iams/pet-health/cat-body-language.jsp|archive-date=2010-02-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSometimes during play, a cat, or more commonly, a kitten, will raise the base of its tail high and stiffen all but the tip into a shape like an upside-down \"U\". This signals great excitement, to the point of hyperactivity. This may also be seen when younger cats chase each other, or when they run around by themselves. When greeting their owner, cats often hold their tails straight up with a quivering motion that indicates extreme happiness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Cat Behaviors|url=http://www.best-cat-tips.com/common_cat_behaviors.htm|work=Best Cat Tips|publisher=www.best-cat-tips.com|accessdate=28 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503205251/http://best-cat-tips.com/common_cat_behaviors.htm|archive-date=3 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  A scared or surprised cat may erect the hairs on its tail and back.  In addition, it may stand more upright and turn its body sideways to increase its apparent size as a threat. Tailless cats, such as the [[Manx (cat)|Manx]], which possess only a small stub of a tail, move the stub around as if they have a full tail.\n\n==Tactile communication==\n\n=== Grooming ===\n[[File:Cat Self-Cleaning 1 2016-07-26.webm|thumb|alt=|Cat grooming itself.]]\nCats often lick other cats as [[allogrooming]] or to bond (this grooming is usually done between familiar cats). They also sometimes lick humans, which may indicate affection. \n\nOral grooming for domestic and feral cats is a common behavior; recent studies on domestic cats show that they spend about 8% of resting time grooming themselves. Grooming is extremely important not only to clean themselves but also to ensure ectoparasite control. Fleas tend to be the most common ectoparasite of cats and some studies allude to indirect evidence that grooming in cats is effective in dislodging fleas from the head and neck. Cats not only use their tongue for grooming to control ectoparasites, but also to scratch itchy areas of the body.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eckstein | first1 = Robert A. | last2 = Hart | first2 = Benjamin L. | year = 2000 | title = Grooming and Control of Fleas in Cats | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 141\u201350 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(00)00095-2| pmid = 10771322 }}</ref>\n\n===Kneading===\n[[File:Amasamiento de un gato.ogv|thumb|Classic kneading of a cat]]\nCats sometimes repeatedly tread their front paws on humans or soft objects with a [[Kneading (cats)|kneading action]].  This is instinctive to kittens and adults, and is presumably derived from the action used to stimulate milk let-down by the mother during nursing.  Kittens \"knead\" the breast while suckling, using the forelimbs one at a time in an alternating pattern to push against the mammary glands to stimulate lactation in the mother. Kneading may also have an origin going back to cats' wild ancestors who had to tread down grass or foliage to make a temporary nest in which to rest.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Stefanie|date=2003|title=Separation anxiety syndrome in dogs and cats|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|language=en|volume=222|issue=11|pages=1526\u20131532|doi=10.2460/javma.2003.222.1526|pmid=12784957|issn=0003-1488|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ea1f3d064138bcb48fbfede733dbf7e17bb905a}}</ref>\n\nCats carry these infantile behaviors beyond nursing and into adulthood. Some cats \"nurse,\" i.e. suck, on clothing or bedding during kneading. The cat exerts firm downwards pressure with its paw, spreading its toes to expose its claws, then curls its toes as it lifts its paw. The process takes place with alternate paws at intervals of one to two seconds. They may knead while sitting on their owner's lap, which may prove painful if the cat has sharp claws.\n\nSince most of the preferred \"domestic traits\" are [[Neoteny#Domestication|neotenous]] or juvenile traits that persist in the adult, kneading may be a relic juvenile behavior retained in adult domestic cats.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Stefanie|title=Separation anxiety syndrome in dogs and cats|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=June 2003|volume=222|issue=11|pages=1526\u201332|accessdate=|doi=10.2460/javma.2003.222.1526|pmid=12784957|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ea1f3d064138bcb48fbfede733dbf7e17bb905a}}</ref> It may also [[stimulate]] the cat and make it feel good, in the same manner as a human [[stretching]]. Kneading is often a precursor to [[sleep]]ing. Many cats [[purr]] while kneading, usually taken to indicate contentment and affection. They also purr mostly when newborn, when feeding, or when trying to feed on their mother's teat. The common association between the two behaviors may corroborate the evidence in favor of the origin of kneading as a remnant instinct.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McPherson|first1=F.J|last2=Chenoweth|first2=P.J|title=Mammalian sexual dimorphism|journal=Animal Reproduction Science|date=April 2012|volume=131|issue=3\u20134|pages=109\u2013122|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2012.02.007|pmid=22482798}}</ref>\n\nCats have scent glands on the underside of their paws.

Unlike a [[dog's penis]], a [[cat's penis]] points backward. Although cats may mark with both sprayed and non-sprayed urine, the spray is usually more thick and oily than normally deposited urine, and may contain additional secretions from anal sacs that help the sprayer to make a stronger communication.  While cats mark their territory both by rubbing of the scent glands and by urine and fecal deposits, spraying seems to be the \"loudest\" feline olfactory statement. It is most frequently observed in intact male cats in competition with other males. Males neutered in adulthood may still spray after neutering.  Female cats also sometimes spray.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n\nA cat that urinates outside the litter box may indicate dissatisfaction with the box, due to a variety of factors such as substrate texture, cleanliness and privacy.

Cats hiss when they are startled, scared, angry, or in pain, and also to scare off intruders into their territory. If the hiss and growl warning does not remove the threat, an attack by the cat may follow. Kittens as young as two to three weeks will hiss and spit when first picked up by a human. \"Spitting\" is a shorter but louder and more emphatic version of hissing.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n[[file:Lion_raring-sound1TamilNadu178.ogg|right|thumb|Familiar lion's roar recorded from a big cat in captivity.]]\n\n=== Howl, yowl, moan, and wail ===\nThese sounds are commonly used during threatening situations.

There are various responses such as when cats arch their backs, erect their hairs and adopt a sideward posture to communicate fear or aggression.  Others may be only a single behavioural change (as perceived by humans) such as slowly blinking to signal relaxation.\n\nDomestic cats frequently use visual communication with their eyes, ears, mouths, tails, coats and body postures.

Its breathing is slow to normal, with legs bent, or hind legs laid out or extended.  The tail is loosely wrapped, extended, or held up. It also hangs down loosely when the cat is standing. When cats are calm, they tend to stand relaxed with a still tail.  \n*'''Stretching posture''' \u2013 another posture indicating the cat is relaxed. When cats lie on their back with their belly exposed, they are in a position of vulnerability.  Therefore, this position may communicate a feeling of trust<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Andrew|title=Feline Behaviour and Welfare|date=2012|publisher=C.A.B. International|location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK|pages=58}}</ref> or comfort; however, cats may also roll onto their back to defend themselves with their claws, or to bask in areas of bright sunlight.\n*'''Yawning posture''' \u2013 either by itself, or in conjunction with a stretch: another posture of a relaxed cat.  Having the mouth open and no teeth exposed indicates playfulness.<ref>{{cite book|title=Communicating with your cat|first=J.

Its back is almost horizontal when standing and moving. Its breathing is normal, with its legs bent or extended (when standing). Its tail is curved back or straight upwards, and there may be twitching while the tail is positioned downwards.\n*'''Tense posture''' \u2013 The cat is lying on its belly, with the back of its body lower than its upper body (slinking) when standing or moving back. Its hind legs are bent and front legs are extended when standing. Its tail is close to the body, tensed or curled downwards; there can be twitching when the cat is standing up.\n*'''Anxious/ovulating posture''' \u2013 The cat is lying on its belly. The back of the body is more visibly lower than the front part when the cat is standing or moving. Its breathing may be fast, and its legs are tucked under its body. The tail is close to the body and may be curled forward (or close to the body when standing), with the tip of the tail moving up and down (or side to side).\n*'''Fearful posture''' \u2013 The cat is lying on its belly or crouching directly on top of its paws. Its entire body may be shaking and very near the ground when standing up. Breathing is also fast, with its legs bent near the surface, and its tail curled and very close to its body when standing on all fours.  A fearful, defensive cat makes itself smaller, lowers itself toward the ground, arches its back and leans its body away from the threat rather than forward.  Fighting usually occurs only when escape is impossible.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n*'''Confident posture''' \u2013 The cat may walk around in a more comfortable manner with its tail up to the sky indicating their importance. Cats often walk through houses with their tail standing up high above them making them look grander and more elegant.\n*'''Terrified posture''' \u2013 The cat is crouched directly on top of its paws, with visible shaking seen in some parts of the body. Its tail is close to the body, and it can be standing up, together with its hair at the back. The legs are very stiff or even bent to increase their size. Typically, cats avoid contact when they feel threatened, although they can resort to varying degrees of aggression when they feel cornered, or when escape is impossible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reading Your Cat|url=http://animal.discovery.com/cat-guide/cat-behavior/reading-your-cat.html|publisher=Animal Planet|accessdate=22 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121232348/http://animal.discovery.com/cat-guide/cat-behavior/reading-your-cat.html|archivedate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n*'''Aggressive posture''' \u2013 The hind legs stiffen, the rump elevates but the back stays flat, tail hairs are erected, the nose is pushed forward and the ears are pulled back slightly.  Because cats have both claws and teeth, they can easily cause injury if they become involved in a fight, so this posture is an attempt to elicit deference by a competitor without fighting.  The aggressor may attempt to make challengers retreat and will pursue them if they do not flee. \n\n[[File:Abby playing in basket.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[tortoiseshell cat]] with erect hairs on its tail and back which in this context indicates excitement or curiosity]]\n\n===Ears===\nCats can change the position of their ears very quickly, in a continuum from erect when the cat is alert and focused, slightly relaxed when the cat is calm, and flattened against the head when extremely defensive or aggressive.<ref name=\"catwatch\" /> In cats, flattened ears generally indicate that an individual feels threatened and may attack.\n\nFlattening of the ears is also a biological adaptation for stalking prey in grass or in a hiding place where the cat's erect ears would give away its position.\n\n===Eyes===\nA direct stare by a cat usually communicates a challenge or threat and is more likely to be seen in high-ranking cats; lower-ranking cats usually withdraw in response.<ref name=\"Miller\" /> The direct stare is often used during [[predation]] or for territorial reasons.\n\nIn contrast to a direct stare, cats will lower their eyelids or slowly blink them to show trust and affection to their owners. According to Gary Weitzman, a licensed veterinarian and animal author, this type of feline body language is similar to a \"kitty kiss\". He further explains in his book, \"How To Speak Cat: A Guide to Decoding Cat Language,\" that slow blinking could be a physiological response to lowered stress hormonal levels from being in a calm state.\n\n\"The slow blink really is an acceptance gesture,\" Weitzman says. \"They do that when they're absolutely comfortable with you, and they do it with other cats as well.\" It is not clear why cats do this when they are feeling calm and comfortable, but Weitzman writes, \"it's likely an autonomic response \u2026 having to do with the cat having its cortisol [stress hormone] levels down.\"\n\nIn fact, Weitzman encourages cat owners to mimic this behavior to return not only a message of affection, but one that reinforces a nonthreatening position. This behavior is not exclusive to domestic house cats. Since cats can be very territorial, in the wild they utilize this slow blinking with other cats to signal themselves as friendly or nonthreatening.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How to speak cat : a guide to decoding cat language|last=Alexander|first=Newman, Aline|others=Weitzman, Gary|isbn=9781426318634|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=880756959|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Tail===\nCats often use their tails to communicate. A cat holding its tail vertically generally indicates positive emotions such as happiness or confidence; the vertical tail is often used as a friendly greeting toward human beings or other cats (usually close relatives).  A half-raised tail can indicate less pleasure, and unhappiness is indicated with a tail held low. In addition, a cat's tail may swing from side to side.  If this motion is slow and \"lazy\", it generally indicates that the cat is in a relaxed state.  Cats will twitch the tip of their tail when hunting or when otherwise alert or playful. Abrupt, full-tail twitching indicates a state of indecision.<!-- This isn't relevant to the scope of this article, but the example Morris uses is a cat who steps outside and discovers it's raining.

This tail behavior is also seen when a cat has become \"irritated\" and is nearing the point of lashing out, typically by biting or swatting with claws extended.  A cat may also twitch its tail when playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iams.com/iams/pet-health/cat-body-language.jsp|title=Cat articles on Iams website|publisher=|access-date=2009-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225152840/http://www.iams.com/iams/pet-health/cat-body-language.jsp|archive-date=2010-02-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSometimes during play, a cat, or more commonly, a kitten, will raise the base of its tail high and stiffen all but the tip into a shape like an upside-down \"U\". This signals great excitement, to the point of hyperactivity. This may also be seen when younger cats chase each other, or when they run around by themselves. When greeting their owner, cats often hold their tails straight up with a quivering motion that indicates extreme happiness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Cat Behaviors|url=http://www.best-cat-tips.com/common_cat_behaviors.htm|work=Best Cat Tips|publisher=www.best-cat-tips.com|accessdate=28 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503205251/http://best-cat-tips.com/common_cat_behaviors.htm|archive-date=3 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  A scared or surprised cat may erect the hairs on its tail and back.  In addition, it may stand more upright and turn its body sideways to increase its apparent size as a threat. Tailless cats, such as the [[Manx (cat)|Manx]], which possess only a small stub of a tail, move the stub around as if they have a full tail.\n\n==Tactile communication==\n\n=== Grooming ===\n[[File:Cat Self-Cleaning 1 2016-07-26.webm|thumb|alt=|Cat grooming itself.]]\nCats often lick other cats as [[allogrooming]] or to bond (this grooming is usually done between familiar cats). They also sometimes lick humans, which may indicate affection. \n\nOral grooming for domestic and feral cats is a common behavior; recent studies on domestic cats show that they spend about 8% of resting time grooming themselves. Grooming is extremely important not only to clean themselves but also to ensure ectoparasite control. Fleas tend to be the most common ectoparasite of cats and some studies allude to indirect evidence that grooming in cats is effective in dislodging fleas from the head and neck. Cats not only use their tongue for grooming to control ectoparasites, but also to scratch itchy areas of the body.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eckstein | first1 = Robert A. | last2 = Hart | first2 = Benjamin L. | year = 2000 | title = Grooming and Control of Fleas in Cats | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 141\u201350 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(00)00095-2| pmid = 10771322 }}</ref>\n\n===Kneading===\n[[File:Amasamiento de un gato.ogv|thumb|Classic kneading of a cat]]\nCats sometimes repeatedly tread their front paws on humans or soft objects with a [[Kneading (cats)|kneading action]].  This is instinctive to kittens and adults, and is presumably derived from the action used to stimulate milk let-down by the mother during nursing.  Kittens \"knead\" the breast while suckling, using the forelimbs one at a time in an alternating pattern to push against the mammary glands to stimulate lactation in the mother. Kneading may also have an origin going back to cats' wild ancestors who had to tread down grass or foliage to make a temporary nest in which to rest.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Stefanie|date=2003|title=Separation anxiety syndrome in dogs and cats|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|language=en|volume=222|issue=11|pages=1526\u20131532|doi=10.2460/javma.2003.222.1526|pmid=12784957|issn=0003-1488|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ea1f3d064138bcb48fbfede733dbf7e17bb905a}}</ref>\n\nCats carry these infantile behaviors beyond nursing and into adulthood. Some cats \"nurse,\" i.e. suck, on clothing or bedding during kneading. The cat exerts firm downwards pressure with its paw, spreading its toes to expose its claws, then curls its toes as it lifts its paw. The process takes place with alternate paws at intervals of one to two seconds. They may knead while sitting on their owner's lap, which may prove painful if the cat has sharp claws.\n\nSince most of the preferred \"domestic traits\" are [[Neoteny#Domestication|neotenous]] or juvenile traits that persist in the adult, kneading may be a relic juvenile behavior retained in adult domestic cats.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Stefanie|title=Separation anxiety syndrome in dogs and cats|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=June 2003|volume=222|issue=11|pages=1526\u201332|accessdate=|doi=10.2460/javma.2003.222.1526|pmid=12784957|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ea1f3d064138bcb48fbfede733dbf7e17bb905a}}</ref> It may also [[stimulate]] the cat and make it feel good, in the same manner as a human [[stretching]]. Kneading is often a precursor to [[sleep]]ing. Many cats [[purr]] while kneading, usually taken to indicate contentment and affection. They also purr mostly when newborn, when feeding, or when trying to feed on their mother's teat. The common association between the two behaviors may corroborate the evidence in favor of the origin of kneading as a remnant instinct.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McPherson|first1=F.J|last2=Chenoweth|first2=P.J|title=Mammalian sexual dimorphism|journal=Animal Reproduction Science|date=April 2012|volume=131|issue=3\u20134|pages=109\u2013122|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2012.02.007|pmid=22482798}}</ref>\n\nCats have scent glands on the underside of their paws.

Unlike a [[dog's penis]], a [[cat's penis]] points backward. Although cats may mark with both sprayed and non-sprayed urine, the spray is usually more thick and oily than normally deposited urine, and may contain additional secretions from anal sacs that help the sprayer to make a stronger communication.  While cats mark their territory both by rubbing of the scent glands and by urine and fecal deposits, spraying seems to be the \"loudest\" feline olfactory statement. It is most frequently observed in intact male cats in competition with other males. Males neutered in adulthood may still spray after neutering.  Female cats also sometimes spray.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n\nA cat that urinates outside the litter box may indicate dissatisfaction with the box, due to a variety of factors such as substrate texture, cleanliness and privacy. It can also be a sign of [[Feline lower urinary tract disease|urinary tract problems]]. Male cats on poor diets are susceptible to crystal formation in the urine which can block the urethra and create a medical emergency.\n\nThe urine of mature male cats in particular contains the [[amino acid]] known as [[felinine]] which is a precursor to [[3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol]] (MMB), the sulfur-containing compound that gives cat urine its characteristically strong odor. Felinine is produced in the urine from 3-methylbutanol-cysteinylglycine (3-MBCG) by the excreted [[peptidase]] [[cauxin]].

Once they are close enough to attack, they pause slightly, and then one cat leaps and tries to bite the nape of the other cat.<ref name=\":13\" /> The other cat has no choice but to retaliate and both cats roll aggressively on the ground, and loud intense screams come from both cats.<ref name=\":13\" /> After some time,the cats separate and stand face to face to begin the attack all over again. This can go on for some time until one cat does not get up again and remains seated.<ref name=\":13\" /> The defeated cat does not move until the victor has completed a sniff of the area and moves outside the fighting area. Once this happens, the defeated cat leaves the area, ending the duel.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nFemales may also fight with each other. If a male and female do not get along, they may also fight.

Since 2007, when the NFL allowed teams to designate several captains to serve as on-field leaders, the starting quarterback has usually been one of the team captains as the leader of the team's offense.\n\nIn the NFL, while the [[starting quarterback]] has no other responsibility or authority, he may, depending on the league or individual team, have various informal duties, such as participation in pre-game ceremonies, the coin toss, or other events outside the game. For instance the starting quarterback is the first player (and third person after the team owner and head coach) to be presented with the [[AFC Championship Game|Lamar Hunt Trophy]]/[[NFC Championship Game|George Halas Trophy]] (after winning the AFC/NFC Conference title) and the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] (after a Super Bowl victory). The starting quarterback of the victorious Super Bowl team is often chosen for the \"[[I'm going to Disney World!]]\" campaign (which includes a trip to [[Walt Disney World]] for them and their families), whether they are the [[Super Bowl MVP]] or not; examples include [[Joe Montana]] ([[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]]), [[Trent Dilfer]] ([[Super Bowl XXXV|XXXV]]), [[Peyton Manning]] ([[Super Bowl 50|50]]), [[Tom Brady]] and [[Julian Edelman]] ([[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]]).

It is believed that \"there is no other position in sports that 'dictates the terms' of a game the way quarterback does, whether that impact is positive or negative, as \"Everybody feeds off of what the quarterback can and cannot do...Defensively, offensively, everybody reacts to what threats or non-threats the quarterback has. Everything else is secondary\". \"An argument can be made that quarterback is the most influential position in team sports, considering he touches the ball on virtually every offensive play of a far shorter season than baseball, basketball or hockey -- a season in which every game is vitally important\". Most consistently successful NFL teams (for instance, multiple Super Bowl appearances within a short period of time) have been centered around a single starting quarterback; the one exception was the [[Washington Redskins]] under head coach [[Joe Gibbs]] who won three Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks from 1982 to 1991.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/29/sports/la-sp-super-bowl-quarterbacks-20120129 |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061328/http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/29/sports/la-sp-super-bowl-quarterbacks-20120129 |archive-date=September 21, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn a team's defense, the middle linebacker is regarded as \"quarterback of the defense\" and is often the defensive leader, since he must be as smart as he is athletic. The middle linebacker (MLB), sometimes known as the \"Mike\", is the only inside linebacker in the 4\u20133 scheme.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Tanier |title=The 4\u20133 vs. the 3\u20134 |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/5913858/The-4-3-vs.-the-3-4 |work=[[NFL on Fox]] |date=2006-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415130829/http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/5913858/The-4-3-vs.-the-3-4 |archive-date=2009-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Backup==\nCompared to other positions in gridiron football, the backup quarterback gets considerably much less playing time than the starting quarterback. A backup quarterback, besides being dressed for a game in case of an injury to the starter, may also have additional roles such as a [[Holder (American football)|holder]] on placekicks or a [[punter (football)|punter]], and often helping to prepare the defense. Backup quarterbacks typically have the career of a [[journeyman quarterback]] and have short stints with multiple teams, a notable exception being [[Frank Reich]] who backed up [[Jim Kelly]] for nine years at the [[Buffalo Bills]]. A capable backup quarterback, however, may threaten the starting quarterback's place in the team (see Platooning quarterbacks below); [[Aaron Rodgers]] was drafted by the [[Green Bay Packers]] as the eventual successor to [[Brett Favre]], though Rodgers served in a backup role for a few years in order to develop sufficiently for the team to give him the starting job.\n\nA quarterback controversy results when a team has two capable quarterbacks competing for the starting position. [[Dallas Cowboys]] head coach [[Tom Landry]] alternated [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Craig Morton]] on each play, sending in the quarterbacks with the play call from the sideline; Morton started in [[Super Bowl V]] which his team lost, while Staubach started the [[Super Bowl VI]] next year and won. Although Morton played most of the 1972 season due to Staubach's injury, Staubach took back the starting job when he rallied the Cowboys in a come-from-behind win in the playoffs and Morton was subsequently traded; Staubach and Morton faced each other in [[Super Bowl XII]]. Another notable quarterback controversy involved the [[San Francisco 49ers]]' who had three capable starters; [[Joe Montana]], [[Steve Young]], and [[Steve Bono]]. Montana suffered a season-ending injury that cost him the [[1991 NFL season]] and was supplanted by Young. Young was injured midway through the season, but Bono held the starting job (despite Young's recovery) until Bono's own injury let Young reclaim it. Montana also missed most of the [[1992 NFL season]] making only one appearance, then was traded away at his request where he took over as the starter for the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]; upon retirement he was succeeded by Bono as the Chiefs' starting quarterback.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ninersnation.com/2016/6/10/11899550/best-qb-units-super-bowl-era-49ers-joe-montana-steve-young-steve-bono-alex-smith-colin-kaepernick |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325200915/https://www.ninersnation.com/2016/6/10/11899550/best-qb-units-super-bowl-era-49ers-joe-montana-steve-young-steve-bono-alex-smith-colin-kaepernick |archive-date=March 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Trends and other roles==\nIn addition to their main role, quarterbacks are occasionally used in other roles. Most teams utilize a backup quarterback as their [[Holder (American football)|holder]] on placekicks. A benefit of using quarterbacks as holders is that it would be easier to pull off a fake field goal attempt, but many coaches prefer to use [[punter (football)|punters]] as holders because a punter will have far more time in practice sessions to work with the kicker than any quarterback would.<ref name=\"Q&A: Who's preferable as a holder for field goals - the punter or backup quarterback?\">{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_13680171|title=Q&A: Who's preferable as a holder for field goals - the punter or backup quarterback?|last=Legwold|first=Jeff|date=October 31, 2009|work=[[The Denver Post]]|accessdate=August 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927213528/http://www.denverpost.com/ci_13680171|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In the [[Wildcat formation|Wildcat]], a formation where a halfback lines up behind the center and the quarterback lines up out wide, the quarterback can be used as a receiving target or a blocker.<ref name=\"The Wildcat Offense: 5 Things You Didn't Know\">{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/entertainment/special_feature_400/416b_the-wildcat-offense-5-things-you-didnt-know.html|title=The Wildcat Offense: 5 Things You Didn't Know|last=MacMillan|first=Malcolm|publisher=[[AskMen]]|accessdate=August 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927233232/http://www.askmen.com/entertainment/special_feature_400/416b_the-wildcat-offense-5-things-you-didnt-know.html|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> A more rare use for a quarterback is to punt the ball himself, a play known as a [[quick kick]].

Ascending the starting role upon Staubach's retirement, White  held his position as the team's punter for several seasons\u2014a double duty he performed to [[All-American]] standard at [[Arizona State University]]. White also had two touchdown receptions as a Dallas Cowboy, both from the [[halfback option]].\n\n===Special tactics===\n\nIf quarterbacks are uncomfortable with the formation the defense is using, they may call an audible change to their play.  For example, if a quarterback receives the call to execute a running play, but he notices that the defense is ready to [[Blitz (American football)|blitz]]&mdash;that is, to send additional defensive backs across the line of scrimmage in an attempt to tackle the quarterback or hurt his ability to pass&mdash;the quarterback may want to change the play. To do this, the quarterback yells a special code, like \"Blue 42,\" or \"Texas 29,\" which tells the offense to switch to a specific play or formation, but it all depends on the quarterback's judgment of the defense's alignment.\n\nQuarterbacks can also \"[[Spike (gridiron football)|spike]]\" (throw the football at the ground) to stop the official game clock. For example, if a team is down by a field goal with only seconds remaining, a quarterback may spike the ball to prevent the game clock from running out. This usually allows the field goal unit to come onto the field, or attempt a final \"[[Hail Mary pass]]\". However, if a team is winning, a quarterback can keep the clock running by [[Quarterback kneel|kneeling]] after the snap. This is normally done when the opposing team has no timeouts and there is little time left in the game, as it allows a team to burn up the remaining time on the clock without risking a turnover or injury.\n\n===Dual-threat quarterbacks===\n[[Image:VICKpb.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Michael Vick]], a member of the NFC team at the NFL's [[2006 Pro Bowl]], uses his mobility to elude [[Dwight Freeney]].]]\n{{Details|Dual-threat quarterback}}\nA dual-threat quarterback possesses the skills and physique to run with the ball if necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/nfl/dual-threat-quarterback.aspx|title=Dual-threat Quarterback Definition - Sporting Charts|website=Sportingcharts.com|access-date=July 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816151529/http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/nfl/dual-threat-quarterback.aspx|archive-date=August 16, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> With the rise of several blitz-heavy defensive schemes and increasingly faster defensive players, the importance of a mobile quarterback has been redefined. While arm power, accuracy, and [[Passing pocket|pocket]] presence&nbsp;\u2013 the ability to successfully operate from within the \"pocket\" formed by his blockers&nbsp;\u2013 are still the most important quarterback virtues, the ability to elude or run past defenders creates an additional threat that allows greater flexibility in a team's passing and running game.\n\nDual-threat quarterbacks have historically been more prolific at the college level. Typically, a quarterback with exceptional quickness is used in an option offense, which allows the quarterback to hand the ball off, run it himself, or pitch it to the running back following him at a distance of three yards outside and one yard behind. This type of offense forces defenders to commit to the running back up the middle, the quarterback around the end, or the running back trailing the quarterback.  It is then that the quarterback has the \"option\" to identify which match-up is most favorable to the offense as the play unfolds and exploit that defensive weakness. In the college game, many schools employ several plays that are designed for the quarterback to run with the ball.  This is much less common in professional football, except for a [[quarterback sneak]], but there is still an emphasis on being mobile enough to escape a heavy [[Rush (American football)|pass rush]].

This is more common at lower levels of football, such as high school or small college, but rare in major college or professional football.\n\nThere are four circumstances in which a two-quarterback system may be used.\n\nThe first is when a team is in the process of determining which quarterback will eventually be the starter, and may choose to use each quarterback for part of the game in order to compare the performances. For instance, the [[Seattle Seahawks]]' [[Pete Carroll]] used the pre-season games in 2012 to select [[Russell Wilson]] as the starting quarterback over [[Matt Flynn]] and [[Tarvaris Jackson]].\n\nThe second is a starter\u2013reliever system, in which the starting quarterback splits the regular season playing time with the backup quarterback, although the former will start playoff games.  This strategy is rare, and was last seen in the NFL in the \"WoodStrock\" combination of [[Don Strock]] and [[David Woodley]], which took the Miami Dolphins to the [[Epic in Miami]] in 1982 and [[Super Bowl XVII]] the following year. The starter-reliever system is distinct from a one-off situation in which a starter is benched in favor of the back-up because the switch is part of the game plan (usually if the starter is playing poorly for that game), and the expectation is that the two players will assume the same roles game after game.\n\nThe third is if a coach decides that the team has two quarterbacks who are equally effective and proceeds to rotate the quarterbacks at predetermined intervals, such as after each quarter or after each series.  Southern California high school football team Corona Centennial operated this model during the 2014 football season, rotating quarterbacks after every series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/highschool/la-sp-corona-quarterbacks-20141220-story.html |title=Two-quarterback system works for Corona Centennial |publisher=Latimes.com |date= |accessdate=May 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407130231/http://www.latimes.com/sports/highschool/la-sp-corona-quarterbacks-20141220-story.html |archive-date=April 7, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>  In a game against the [[Chicago Bears]] in the seventh week of the 1971 season, [[Dallas Cowboys]] head coach [[Tom Landry]] alternated [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Craig Morton]] on each play, sending in the quarterbacks with the play call from the sideline.\n\nThe fourth, still occasionally seen in major-college football, is the use of different quarterbacks in different game or down/distance situations.  Generally this involves a running quarterback and a passing quarterback in an option or wishbone offense.  In Canadian football, quarterback sneaks or other runs in short-yardage situations tend to be successful as a result of the distance between the [[offensive line|offensive]] and [[defensive line]]s being one yard. [[Drew Tate]], a quarterback for the [[Calgary Stampeders]], was primarily used in short-yardage situations and led the CFL in rushing touchdowns during the [[2014 CFL season|2014 season]] with ten scores as the backup to [[Bo Levi Mitchell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/cfl-55-yard-line/backup-quarterback-drew-tate-plays-major-role-in-limited-time-in-stampeders--grey-cup-win-045955279.html |title=Backup quarterback Drew Tate plays major role in limited time in Stampeders' Grey Cup win |publisher=Ca.sports.yahoo.com |date=November 30, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015 |author=Denomme, Ian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105210801/https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/cfl-55-yard-line/backup-quarterback-drew-tate-plays-major-role-in-limited-time-in-stampeders--grey-cup-win-045955279.html |archivedate=January 5, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cfl.ca/statistics/league/stat/Rushing/year/2014/type/reg | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105210152/http://cfl.ca/statistics/league/stat/Rushing/year/2014/type/reg | archivedate=January 5, 2015 | title=Rushing - 2014 | publisher=Cfl.ca | accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> This strategy had all but disappeared from professional American football, but returned to some extent with the advent of the \"wildcat\" offense.

The \"fullback\" was the furthest back behind the line of scrimmage.  The \"halfback\" was halfway between the fullback and the line of scrimmage, and the \"quarter-back\" was halfway between the halfback and the line of scrimmage.  Hence, he was called a \"quarter-back\" by Walter Camp.\n[[File:McMillinFeatures.png|thumb|left|Bo McMillin tossing a pass.]]\nThe requirement to stay behind the line of scrimmage was soon rescinded, but it was later re-imposed in [[six-man football]]. The exchange between the person snapping the ball (typically the [[center (American and Canadian football)|center]]) and the quarterback was initially an awkward one because it involved a kick.<ref name=\"Walter Camp and rugby\" /> At first, centers gave the ball a small boot, and then picked it up and handed it to the quarterback.<ref name=\"Walter Camp and rugby\" /> By 1889, Yale center Bert Hanson was bouncing the ball on the ground to the quarterback between his legs.<ref name=\"Walter Camp and rugby\" /> The following year, a rule change officially made snapping the ball using the hands between the legs legal.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=18}} Several years later, [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]] at the [[Chicago Maroons football|University of Chicago]] invented the lift-up snap: the center passed the ball off the ground and between his legs to a standing quarterback.<ref name=\"Walter Camp and rugby\" /> A similar set of changes were later adopted in [[Canadian football]] as part of the [[Burnside rules]], a set of rules proposed by John Meldrum \"Thrift\" Burnside, the captain of the [[Toronto Varsity Blues#Football|University of Toronto's football team]].<ref name=\"Football History 101: Why Canadians Have Only Three Downs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aolnews.com/2006/11/17/football-history-101-why-canadians-have-only-three-downs/|title=Football History 101: Why Canadians Have Only Three Downs|last=Warner|first=David J.|date=November 17, 2006|publisher=[[AOL News]]|accessdate=August 17, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104212541/http://www.aolnews.com/2006/11/17/football-history-101-why-canadians-have-only-three-downs/|archivedate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe change from a scrummage to a \"scrimmage\" made it easier for teams to decide what plays they would run before the snap.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=20}} At first, the captains of college teams were put in charge of play-calling, indicating with shouted codes which players would run with the ball and how the men on the line were supposed to [[Blocking (American football)|block]].{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=20}} Yale later used visual signals, including adjustments of the captain's knit hat, to call plays.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=20}} Centers could also signal plays based on the alignment of the ball before the snap.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=20}} In 1888, however, [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton University]] began to have its quarterback call plays using number signals.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=21}} That system caught on, and quarterbacks began to act as directors and organizers of offensive play.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=21}}\n\nEarly on, quarterbacks were used in a variety of formations.

The [[single-wing formation]], a run-oriented offensive set, was invented by football coach [[Pop Warner|Glenn \"Pop\" Warner]] around the year 1908.{{sfn|Long & Czarnecki|2011|p=110}} In the single-wing, the quarterback was positioned behind the line of scrimmage and was flanked by a [[Halfback (American football)|tailback]], [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] and [[wingback (American football)|wingback]].{{sfn|Long & Czarnecki|2011|p=110}} He served largely as a [[Blocking (American football)|blocking]] back; the tailback typically took the snap, either running forward with the ball or making a lateral pass to one of the other players in the backfield.{{sfn|Long & Czarnecki|2011|p=110}} The quarterback's job was usually to make blocks upfield to help the tailback or fullback gain yards.{{sfn|Long & Czarnecki|2011|p=110}} Passing plays were rare in the single-wing, an unbalanced power formation where four linemen lined up to one side of the center and two lined up to the other.{{sfn|Long & Czarnecki|2011|p=110}} The tailback was the focus of the offense, and was often a [[triple-threat man]] who would either pass, run or kick the ball.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=71}}\n\nOffensive play-calling continued to focus on [[rush (gridiron football)|rush]]ing up through the 1920s, when professional leagues began to challenge the popularity of college football.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=79}} In the early days of the professional [[National Football League]] (NFL), which was founded in 1920, games were largely low-scoring affairs. Two-thirds of all games in the 1920s were shutouts, and quarterbacks/tailbacks usually passed only out of desperation.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=79}} In addition to a reluctance to risk turnovers by passing, various rules existed that limited the effectiveness of the forward pass: passers were required to drop back five yards behind the line of scrimmage before they could attempt a pass, and incomplete passes in the [[end zone]] resulted in a change of possession and a [[touchback]].{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=79}} Additionally, the rules required the ball to be snapped from the location on the field where it was ruled dead; if a play ended with a player going out of bounds, the center had to snap the ball from the sideline, an awkward place to start a play.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=79}}\n\nDespite these constraints, player-coach [[Curly Lambeau]] of the [[Green Bay Packers]], along with several other NFL figures of his era, was a consistent proponent of the forward pass.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=79}} The Packers found success in the 1920s and 1930s using variations on the single-wing that emphasized the passing game.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=80}} Packers quarterback [[Red Dunn]] and [[New York Giants]] and [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] quarterback [[Benny Friedman]] were the leading passers of their era, but passing remained a relative rarity among other teams; between 1920 and 1932, there were three times as many running plays as there were passing plays.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=80}}\n\nEarly NFL quarterbacks typically were responsible for calling the team's offensive plays with signals before the snap.{{sfn|Peterson|1997|p=72}} The use of the [[huddle]] to call plays originated with Stagg in 1896, but only began to be used regularly in college games in 1921.{{sfn|Peterson|1997|p=72}} In the NFL, players were typically assigned numbers, as were the gaps between offensive linemen.{{sfn|Peterson|1997|p=72}} One player, usually the quarterback, would call signals indicating which player was to run the ball and which gap he would run toward.{{sfn|Peterson|1997|p=73}} Play-calling or any other kind of coaching from the sidelines was not permitted during this period, leaving the quarterback to devise the offensive strategy (often, the quarterback doubled as head coach during this era).{{sfn|Peterson|1997|p=73}} Substitutions were limited, and quarterbacks often played on both offense and defense. {{sfn|Peterson|1997|p=73}}\n[[File:T Formation.svg|thumb|300px|An image of the [[T-formation]], the formation that introduced and established the role of the modern quarterback.

Although this remained a common practice in the NFL through the 1970s, fewer QBs were doing it by the 1980s and even Hall of Famers like [[Joe Montana]] did not call their own plays. [[Buffalo Bills]] QB [[Jim Kelly]] was one of the last to regularly call plays. [[Peyton Manning]], formerly of the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos, was the best modern example of a quarterback who called his own plays, primary using an uptempo, no-huddle-based attack. Manning had almost complete control over the offense. Former Baltimore Ravens quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] retained a high degree of control over the offense as well, particularly when running a no-huddle scheme, as does [[Ben Roethlisberger]] of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].\n\n==Race==\n{{main|Racial issues faced by black quarterbacks}}\n\nDuring the 2013 season, 67 percent of NFL players were [[African American]] (blacks make up 13 percent of the US population), yet only 17 percent of quarterbacks were; 82 percent of quarterbacks were white, with just one percent of quarterbacks from other races.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 2014 Racial and Gender Report Card: National Football League|url=http://www.tidesport.org/2014%20National%20Football%20League%20Racial%20and%20Gender%20Report%20Card.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203072538/http://www.tidesport.org/2014%20National%20Football%20League%20Racial%20and%20Gender%20Report%20Card.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 3, 2015|accessdate=February 3, 2015|date=September 10, 2014}}</ref> In 2017, the [[New York Giants]] benched longtime starter [[Eli Manning]] in favor of [[Geno Smith]], who was declared the starter.

Since 2007, when the NFL allowed teams to designate several captains to serve as on-field leaders, the starting quarterback has usually been one of the team captains as the leader of the team's offense.\n\nIn the NFL, while the [[starting quarterback]] has no other responsibility or authority, he may, depending on the league or individual team, have various informal duties, such as participation in pre-game ceremonies, the coin toss, or other events outside the game. For instance the starting quarterback is the first player (and third person after the team owner and head coach) to be presented with the [[AFC Championship Game|Lamar Hunt Trophy]]/[[NFC Championship Game|George Halas Trophy]] (after winning the AFC/NFC Conference title) and the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] (after a Super Bowl victory). The starting quarterback of the victorious Super Bowl team is often chosen for the \"[[I'm going to Disney World!]]\" campaign (which includes a trip to [[Walt Disney World]] for them and their families), whether they are the [[Super Bowl MVP]] or not; examples include [[Joe Montana]] ([[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]]), [[Trent Dilfer]] ([[Super Bowl XXXV|XXXV]]), [[Peyton Manning]] ([[Super Bowl 50|50]]), [[Tom Brady]] and [[Julian Edelman]] ([[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]]).

It is believed that \"there is no other position in sports that 'dictates the terms' of a game the way quarterback does, whether that impact is positive or negative, as \"Everybody feeds off of what the quarterback can and cannot do...Defensively, offensively, everybody reacts to what threats or non-threats the quarterback has. Everything else is secondary\". \"An argument can be made that quarterback is the most influential position in team sports, considering he touches the ball on virtually every offensive play of a far shorter season than baseball, basketball or hockey -- a season in which every game is vitally important\". Most consistently successful NFL teams (for instance, multiple Super Bowl appearances within a short period of time) have been centered around a single starting quarterback; the one exception was the [[Washington Redskins]] under head coach [[Joe Gibbs]] who won three Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks from 1982 to 1991.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/29/sports/la-sp-super-bowl-quarterbacks-20120129 |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061328/http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/29/sports/la-sp-super-bowl-quarterbacks-20120129 |archive-date=September 21, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn a team's defense, the middle linebacker is regarded as \"quarterback of the defense\" and is often the defensive leader, since he must be as smart as he is athletic. The middle linebacker (MLB), sometimes known as the \"Mike\", is the only inside linebacker in the 4\u20133 scheme.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Tanier |title=The 4\u20133 vs. the 3\u20134 |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/5913858/The-4-3-vs.-the-3-4 |work=[[NFL on Fox]] |date=2006-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415130829/http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/5913858/The-4-3-vs.-the-3-4 |archive-date=2009-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Backup==\nCompared to other positions in gridiron football, the backup quarterback gets considerably much less playing time than the starting quarterback. A backup quarterback, besides being dressed for a game in case of an injury to the starter, may also have additional roles such as a [[Holder (American football)|holder]] on placekicks or a [[punter (football)|punter]], and often helping to prepare the defense. Backup quarterbacks typically have the career of a [[journeyman quarterback]] and have short stints with multiple teams, a notable exception being [[Frank Reich]] who backed up [[Jim Kelly]] for nine years at the [[Buffalo Bills]]. A capable backup quarterback, however, may threaten the starting quarterback's place in the team (see Platooning quarterbacks below); [[Aaron Rodgers]] was drafted by the [[Green Bay Packers]] as the eventual successor to [[Brett Favre]], though Rodgers served in a backup role for a few years in order to develop sufficiently for the team to give him the starting job.\n\nA quarterback controversy results when a team has two capable quarterbacks competing for the starting position. [[Dallas Cowboys]] head coach [[Tom Landry]] alternated [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Craig Morton]] on each play, sending in the quarterbacks with the play call from the sideline; Morton started in [[Super Bowl V]] which his team lost, while Staubach started the [[Super Bowl VI]] next year and won. Although Morton played most of the 1972 season due to Staubach's injury, Staubach took back the starting job when he rallied the Cowboys in a come-from-behind win in the playoffs and Morton was subsequently traded; Staubach and Morton faced each other in [[Super Bowl XII]]. Another notable quarterback controversy involved the [[San Francisco 49ers]]' who had three capable starters; [[Joe Montana]], [[Steve Young]], and [[Steve Bono]].

Most teams utilize a backup quarterback as their [[Holder (American football)|holder]] on placekicks.

Ascending the starting role upon Staubach's retirement, White  held his position as the team's punter for several seasons\u2014a double duty he performed to [[All-American]] standard at [[Arizona State University]]. White also had two touchdown receptions as a Dallas Cowboy, both from the [[halfback option]].\n\n===Special tactics===\n\nIf quarterbacks are uncomfortable with the formation the defense is using, they may call an audible change to their play.  For example, if a quarterback receives the call to execute a running play, but he notices that the defense is ready to [[Blitz (American football)|blitz]]&mdash;that is, to send additional defensive backs across the line of scrimmage in an attempt to tackle the quarterback or hurt his ability to pass&mdash;the quarterback may want to change the play. To do this, the quarterback yells a special code, like \"Blue 42,\" or \"Texas 29,\" which tells the offense to switch to a specific play or formation, but it all depends on the quarterback's judgment of the defense's alignment.\n\nQuarterbacks can also \"[[Spike (gridiron football)|spike]]\" (throw the football at the ground) to stop the official game clock. For example, if a team is down by a field goal with only seconds remaining, a quarterback may spike the ball to prevent the game clock from running out. This usually allows the field goal unit to come onto the field, or attempt a final \"[[Hail Mary pass]]\". However, if a team is winning, a quarterback can keep the clock running by [[Quarterback kneel|kneeling]] after the snap. This is normally done when the opposing team has no timeouts and there is little time left in the game, as it allows a team to burn up the remaining time on the clock without risking a turnover or injury.\n\n===Dual-threat quarterbacks===\n[[Image:VICKpb.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Michael Vick]], a member of the NFC team at the NFL's [[2006 Pro Bowl]], uses his mobility to elude [[Dwight Freeney]].]]\n{{Details|Dual-threat quarterback}}\nA dual-threat quarterback possesses the skills and physique to run with the ball if necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/nfl/dual-threat-quarterback.aspx|title=Dual-threat Quarterback Definition - Sporting Charts|website=Sportingcharts.com|access-date=July 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816151529/http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/nfl/dual-threat-quarterback.aspx|archive-date=August 16, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> With the rise of several blitz-heavy defensive schemes and increasingly faster defensive players, the importance of a mobile quarterback has been redefined. While arm power, accuracy, and [[Passing pocket|pocket]] presence&nbsp;\u2013 the ability to successfully operate from within the \"pocket\" formed by his blockers&nbsp;\u2013 are still the most important quarterback virtues, the ability to elude or run past defenders creates an additional threat that allows greater flexibility in a team's passing and running game.\n\nDual-threat quarterbacks have historically been more prolific at the college level. Typically, a quarterback with exceptional quickness is used in an option offense, which allows the quarterback to hand the ball off, run it himself, or pitch it to the running back following him at a distance of three yards outside and one yard behind. This type of offense forces defenders to commit to the running back up the middle, the quarterback around the end, or the running back trailing the quarterback.  It is then that the quarterback has the \"option\" to identify which match-up is most favorable to the offense as the play unfolds and exploit that defensive weakness. In the college game, many schools employ several plays that are designed for the quarterback to run with the ball.  This is much less common in professional football, except for a [[quarterback sneak]], but there is still an emphasis on being mobile enough to escape a heavy [[Rush (American football)|pass rush]]. Historically, high-profile dual-threat quarterbacks in the NFL were uncommon, [[Steve Young]] and [[John Elway]] being among the notable exceptions, leading their teams to three and five Super Bowl appearances respectively; and [[Michael Vick]], whose rushing ability was a rarity in the early 2000s, although he never led his team to a Super Bowl. In recent years,{{When|date=February 2016}} quarterbacks with dual-threat capabilities have become more popular.

This is more common at lower levels of football, such as high school or small college, but rare in major college or professional football.\n\nThere are four circumstances in which a two-quarterback system may be used.\n\nThe first is when a team is in the process of determining which quarterback will eventually be the starter, and may choose to use each quarterback for part of the game in order to compare the performances. For instance, the [[Seattle Seahawks]]' [[Pete Carroll]] used the pre-season games in 2012 to select [[Russell Wilson]] as the starting quarterback over [[Matt Flynn]] and [[Tarvaris Jackson]].\n\nThe second is a starter\u2013reliever system, in which the starting quarterback splits the regular season playing time with the backup quarterback, although the former will start playoff games.  This strategy is rare, and was last seen in the NFL in the \"WoodStrock\" combination of [[Don Strock]] and [[David Woodley]], which took the Miami Dolphins to the [[Epic in Miami]] in 1982 and [[Super Bowl XVII]] the following year. The starter-reliever system is distinct from a one-off situation in which a starter is benched in favor of the back-up because the switch is part of the game plan (usually if the starter is playing poorly for that game), and the expectation is that the two players will assume the same roles game after game.\n\nThe third is if a coach decides that the team has two quarterbacks who are equally effective and proceeds to rotate the quarterbacks at predetermined intervals, such as after each quarter or after each series.  Southern California high school football team Corona Centennial operated this model during the 2014 football season, rotating quarterbacks after every series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/highschool/la-sp-corona-quarterbacks-20141220-story.html |title=Two-quarterback system works for Corona Centennial |publisher=Latimes.com |date= |accessdate=May 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407130231/http://www.latimes.com/sports/highschool/la-sp-corona-quarterbacks-20141220-story.html |archive-date=April 7, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>  In a game against the [[Chicago Bears]] in the seventh week of the 1971 season, [[Dallas Cowboys]] head coach [[Tom Landry]] alternated [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Craig Morton]] on each play, sending in the quarterbacks with the play call from the sideline.\n\nThe fourth, still occasionally seen in major-college football, is the use of different quarterbacks in different game or down/distance situations.  Generally this involves a running quarterback and a passing quarterback in an option or wishbone offense.  In Canadian football, quarterback sneaks or other runs in short-yardage situations tend to be successful as a result of the distance between the [[offensive line|offensive]] and [[defensive line]]s being one yard. [[Drew Tate]], a quarterback for the [[Calgary Stampeders]], was primarily used in short-yardage situations and led the CFL in rushing touchdowns during the [[2014 CFL season|2014 season]] with ten scores as the backup to [[Bo Levi Mitchell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/cfl-55-yard-line/backup-quarterback-drew-tate-plays-major-role-in-limited-time-in-stampeders--grey-cup-win-045955279.html |title=Backup quarterback Drew Tate plays major role in limited time in Stampeders' Grey Cup win |publisher=Ca.sports.yahoo.com |date=November 30, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015 |author=Denomme, Ian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105210801/https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/cfl-55-yard-line/backup-quarterback-drew-tate-plays-major-role-in-limited-time-in-stampeders--grey-cup-win-045955279.html |archivedate=January 5, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cfl.ca/statistics/league/stat/Rushing/year/2014/type/reg | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105210152/http://cfl.ca/statistics/league/stat/Rushing/year/2014/type/reg | archivedate=January 5, 2015 | title=Rushing - 2014 | publisher=Cfl.ca | accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> This strategy had all but disappeared from professional American football, but returned to some extent with the advent of the \"wildcat\" offense.

Originally he was not allowed to run forward of the line of scrimmage:\n\n{{quote|text=A scrimmage takes place when the holder of the ball puts it on the ground before him and puts it in play while on-side either by kicking the ball or by snapping it back with his foot.

The \"fullback\" was the furthest back behind the line of scrimmage.  The \"halfback\" was halfway between the fullback and the line of scrimmage, and the \"quarter-back\" was halfway between the halfback and the line of scrimmage.  Hence, he was called a \"quarter-back\" by Walter Camp.\n[[File:McMillinFeatures.png|thumb|left|Bo McMillin tossing a pass.]]\nThe requirement to stay behind the line of scrimmage was soon rescinded, but it was later re-imposed in [[six-man football]]. The exchange between the person snapping the ball (typically the [[center (American and Canadian football)|center]]) and the quarterback was initially an awkward one because it involved a kick.<ref name=\"Walter Camp and rugby\" /> At first, centers gave the ball a small boot, and then picked it up and handed it to the quarterback.<ref name=\"Walter Camp and rugby\" /> By 1889, Yale center Bert Hanson was bouncing the ball on the ground to the quarterback between his legs.<ref name=\"Walter Camp and rugby\" /> The following year, a rule change officially made snapping the ball using the hands between the legs legal.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=18}} Several years later, [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]] at the [[Chicago Maroons football|University of Chicago]] invented the lift-up snap: the center passed the ball off the ground and between his legs to a standing quarterback.<ref name=\"Walter Camp and rugby\" /> A similar set of changes were later adopted in [[Canadian football]] as part of the [[Burnside rules]], a set of rules proposed by John Meldrum \"Thrift\" Burnside, the captain of the [[Toronto Varsity Blues#Football|University of Toronto's football team]].<ref name=\"Football History 101: Why Canadians Have Only Three Downs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aolnews.com/2006/11/17/football-history-101-why-canadians-have-only-three-downs/|title=Football History 101: Why Canadians Have Only Three Downs|last=Warner|first=David J.|date=November 17, 2006|publisher=[[AOL News]]|accessdate=August 17, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104212541/http://www.aolnews.com/2006/11/17/football-history-101-why-canadians-have-only-three-downs/|archivedate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe change from a scrummage to a \"scrimmage\" made it easier for teams to decide what plays they would run before the snap.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=20}} At first, the captains of college teams were put in charge of play-calling, indicating with shouted codes which players would run with the ball and how the men on the line were supposed to [[Blocking (American football)|block]].{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=20}} Yale later used visual signals, including adjustments of the captain's knit hat, to call plays.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=20}} Centers could also signal plays based on the alignment of the ball before the snap.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=20}} In 1888, however, [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton University]] began to have its quarterback call plays using number signals.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=21}} That system caught on, and quarterbacks began to act as directors and organizers of offensive play.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|p=21}}\n\nEarly on, quarterbacks were used in a variety of formations.

Two-thirds of all games in the 1920s were shutouts, and quarterbacks/tailbacks usually passed only out of desperation.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=79}} In addition to a reluctance to risk turnovers by passing, various rules existed that limited the effectiveness of the forward pass: passers were required to drop back five yards behind the line of scrimmage before they could attempt a pass, and incomplete passes in the [[end zone]] resulted in a change of possession and a [[touchback]].{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=79}} Additionally, the rules required the ball to be snapped from the location on the field where it was ruled dead; if a play ended with a player going out of bounds, the center had to snap the ball from the sideline, an awkward place to start a play.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=79}}\n\nDespite these constraints, player-coach [[Curly Lambeau]] of the [[Green Bay Packers]], along with several other NFL figures of his era, was a consistent proponent of the forward pass.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=79}} The Packers found success in the 1920s and 1930s using variations on the single-wing that emphasized the passing game.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=80}} Packers quarterback [[Red Dunn]] and [[New York Giants]] and [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] quarterback [[Benny Friedman]] were the leading passers of their era, but passing remained a relative rarity among other teams; between 1920 and 1932, there were three times as many running plays as there were passing plays.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=80}}\n\nEarly NFL quarterbacks typically were responsible for calling the team's offensive plays with signals before the snap.{{sfn|Peterson|1997|p=72}} The use of the [[huddle]] to call plays originated with Stagg in 1896, but only began to be used regularly in college games in 1921.{{sfn|Peterson|1997|p=72}} In the NFL, players were typically assigned numbers, as were the gaps between offensive linemen.{{sfn|Peterson|1997|p=72}} One player, usually the quarterback, would call signals indicating which player was to run the ball and which gap he would run toward.{{sfn|Peterson|1997|p=73}} Play-calling or any other kind of coaching from the sidelines was not permitted during this period, leaving the quarterback to devise the offensive strategy (often, the quarterback doubled as head coach during this era).{{sfn|Peterson|1997|p=73}} Substitutions were limited, and quarterbacks often played on both offense and defense. {{sfn|Peterson|1997|p=73}}\n[[File:T Formation.svg|thumb|300px|An image of the [[T-formation]], the formation that introduced and established the role of the modern quarterback.

Some teams use an [[offensive coordinator]], an assistant coach whose duties include offensive game-planning and often play-calling. In the NFL, coaches are allowed to communicate with quarterbacks and call plays using audio equipment built into the player's helmet. Quarterbacks are allowed to hear, but not talk to, their coaches until there are fifteen seconds left on the play clock.<ref>Mayer, Larry, [http://www.chicagobears.com/news/ChalkTalkStory.asp?story_id=3710 When does radio communication get cut off?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102705/http://www.chicagobears.com/news/ChalkTalkStory.asp?story_id=3710 |date=September 29, 2007 }} (August 15, 2007), chicagobears.com. Retrieved on August 16, 2007.</ref> Once the quarterback receives the call, he may relay it to other players via signals or in a [[huddle]].\n\nDallas Cowboys head coach [[Tom Landry]] was an early advocate of taking play calling out of the quarterback's hands. Although this remained a common practice in the NFL through the 1970s, fewer QBs were doing it by the 1980s and even Hall of Famers like [[Joe Montana]] did not call their own plays. [[Buffalo Bills]] QB [[Jim Kelly]] was one of the last to regularly call plays. [[Peyton Manning]], formerly of the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos, was the best modern example of a quarterback who called his own plays, primary using an uptempo, no-huddle-based attack. Manning had almost complete control over the offense. Former Baltimore Ravens quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] retained a high degree of control over the offense as well, particularly when running a no-huddle scheme, as does [[Ben Roethlisberger]] of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].\n\n==Race==\n{{main|Racial issues faced by black quarterbacks}}\n\nDuring the 2013 season, 67 percent of NFL players were [[African American]] (blacks make up 13 percent of the US population), yet only 17 percent of quarterbacks were; 82 percent of quarterbacks were white, with just one percent of quarterbacks from other races.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 2014 Racial and Gender Report Card: National Football League|url=http://www.tidesport.org/2014%20National%20Football%20League%20Racial%20and%20Gender%20Report%20Card.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203072538/http://www.tidesport.org/2014%20National%20Football%20League%20Racial%20and%20Gender%20Report%20Card.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 3, 2015|accessdate=February 3, 2015|date=September 10, 2014}}</ref> In 2017, the [[New York Giants]] benched longtime starter [[Eli Manning]] in favor of [[Geno Smith]], who was declared the starter.

The first season featured [[Trista Sutter|Trista Rehn]], the runner-up date from the first season of ''[[The Bachelor (American TV series)|The Bachelor]]'', offering the opportunity for Rehn to choose a husband among 25 bachelors. The 2004 season of ''The Bachelorette'' again took a runner-up from the previous season of ''The Bachelor''.

As the name implies, the series revolves around a single bachelorette (deemed eligible), who is usually a former contestant from the previous ''Bachelor'' season, and a pool of romantic interests (typically 25; 30 in season 5), which could include a potential husband for the bachelorette; it is a gender-reversed version of its parent show. The show starts with the bachelorette standing in front of the mansion and greeting each male contestant individually as they make an entrance to the bachelorette. After each rose ceremony, at least one contestant does not receive a rose and goes home; therefore, the pool of contenders gets smaller, which eventually leaves the bachelorette to decide between two contestants in the final rose ceremony.\n\nFor the final selection, one of two male suitors proposes to the bachelorette.  All fifteen seasons of ''The Bachelorette'' have ended with a proposal which the bachelorette either accepted or declined. Trista Rehn's marriage to [[Ryan Sutter]], [[Ashley Hebert]]'s marriage to JP Rosenbaum,  Desiree Hartsock's marriage to Chris Siegfried, and Rachel Lindsay\u2019s marriage to Bryan Abasolo have been the only marriages to result. The weddings of the first two were broadcast on ABC.\n\nSeason 11 was the first season to feature a twist in casting. Since producers could not decide between ''The Bachelor'' Season 19 contenders Kaitlyn Bristowe and Britt Nilsson, the 25 men participating had to decide which bachelorette would make the best wife.

The show is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[The Bachelor (American TV series)|The Bachelor]]'' that airs on the same network. The first season featured [[Trista Sutter|Trista Rehn]], the runner-up date from the first season of ''[[The Bachelor (American TV series)|The Bachelor]]'', offering the opportunity for Rehn to choose a husband among 25 bachelors. The 2004 season of ''The Bachelorette'' again took a runner-up from the previous season of ''The Bachelor''. After last airing on February 28, 2005, the series returned to ABC during the spring of 2008, following an absence of three years.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/abc-confirms-bachelorette-return-this-summer-with-fourth-season-6370.php|publisher = Reality TV World|title = ABC Confirms Bachelorette Return this Summer with Fourth Season}}</ref>\n\nOn August 5, 2019, the series was renewed for a sixteenth season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2019/08/05/the-bachelorette-bachelor-in-paradise-renewed-abc/|title=''The Bachelorette'', ''Bachelor in Paradise'' Both Renewed at ABC|work=TVLine|first=Rebecca|last=Iannucci|date=August 5, 2019|accessdate=August 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAll of the rules are adapted from the [[The Bachelor (U.S. TV series)#Plot|rules of ''The Bachelor'']], its parent show. As the name implies, the series revolves around a single bachelorette (deemed eligible), who is usually a former contestant from the previous ''Bachelor'' season, and a pool of romantic interests (typically 25; 30 in season 5), which could include a potential husband for the bachelorette; it is a gender-reversed version of its parent show. The show starts with the bachelorette standing in front of the mansion and greeting each male contestant individually as they make an entrance to the bachelorette. After each rose ceremony, at least one contestant does not receive a rose and goes home; therefore, the pool of contenders gets smaller, which eventually leaves the bachelorette to decide between two contestants in the final rose ceremony.\n\nFor the final selection, one of two male suitors proposes to the bachelorette.  All fifteen seasons of ''The Bachelorette'' have ended with a proposal which the bachelorette either accepted or declined. Trista Rehn's marriage to [[Ryan Sutter]], [[Ashley Hebert]]'s marriage to JP Rosenbaum,  Desiree Hartsock's marriage to Chris Siegfried, and Rachel Lindsay\u2019s marriage to Bryan Abasolo have been the only marriages to result. The weddings of the first two were broadcast on ABC.\n\nSeason 11 was the first season to feature a twist in casting. Since producers could not decide between ''The Bachelor'' Season 19 contenders Kaitlyn Bristowe and Britt Nilsson, the 25 men participating had to decide which bachelorette would make the best wife. In the end, more men voted for Kaitlyn and Britt was sent home on the first night.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2015/03/09/two-bachelorettes-for-season-11/77489656/|title=Surprise!

Some viewers were becoming tired of the show's scripted nature and speaking out.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Bachelorette Is Back \u2013 More Addictive & Ridiculous Than Ever | journal = The Jewish Journal | date = May 24, 2011 | first = Ilana | last = Angel| id = | url = http://www.jewishjournal.com/keepingitreal/item/the_bachelorette_is_back_more_addictive_ridiculous_than_ever_20110524 | accessdate = July 16, 2012 | quote = The only thing lamer than this show is the people who make it.

Since the fifth season, the third and remaining episodes filmed around the world. Episodes have been filmed throughout the United States, Canada, Spain, Iceland, Turkey, Portugal, Thailand, China (Hong Kong only), Bermuda, England, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium and Ireland.
