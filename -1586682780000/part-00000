While [[Polarization (waves)|linearly polarized]] light occurs when the electric field vector oscillates only in one plane, circularly polarized light occurs when the direction of the electric field vector rotates about its propagation direction while the vector retains constant magnitude. At a single point in space, the circularly polarized-vector will trace out a circle over one period of the wave frequency, hence the name. The two diagrams below show the electric field vectors of linearly and circularly polarized light, at one moment of time, for a range of positions; the plot of the circularly polarized electric vector forms a helix along the direction of propagation (k). For left circularly polarized light (LCP) with propagation towards the observer, the electric vector rotates [[clockwise|counterclockwise]].<ref name=\"E. I. Solomon and A. B. P. Lever 2006 78\"/> For right circularly polarized light (RCP), the electric vector rotates clockwise.\n\n[[File:Linearly pol.png]]     [[File:Circularly pol.png]]\n\n===Interaction of circularly polarized light with matter===\nWhen circularly polarized light passes through an absorbing optically active medium, the speeds between right and left polarizations differ (c<sub>L</sub> \u2260 c<sub>R</sub>) as well as their [[wavelength]] (\u03bb<sub>L</sub> \u2260 \u03bb<sub>R</sub>) and the extent to which they are absorbed (\u03b5<sub>L</sub>\u2260\u03b5<sub>R</sub>). ''Circular dichroism'' is the difference \u0394\u03b5 \u2261 \u03b5<sub>L</sub>- \u03b5<sub>R</sub>.<ref name=b1/> The electric field of a light beam causes a linear displacement of charge when interacting with a molecule ([[electric dipole]]), whereas its magnetic field causes a circulation of charge ([[magnetic dipole]]). These two motions combined cause an excitation of an [[electron]] in a helical motion, which includes [[translation (physics)|translation]] and [[rotation]] and their associated [[Operator (mathematics)|operators]]. The experimentally determined relationship between the [[rotational strength]] (R) of a sample and the \u0394\u03b5 is given by\n:<math>R_{exp} = \\frac{3hc10^{3} \\ln(10)}{32\\pi^{3}N_A} \\int \\frac{\\Delta\\epsilon}{\\nu} d{\\nu}</math>\nThe rotational strength has also been determined theoretically,\n:<math>R_{theo} = \\frac{1}{2mc} Im \\int \\Psi_g \\widehat{M}_{(elec. dipole)} \\Psi_e d\\tau \\bullet \\int \\Psi_g \\widehat{M}_{(mag. dipole)} \\Psi_e d\\tau </math>\nWe see from these two equations that in order to have non-zero <math>\\Delta\\epsilon</math>, the electric and magnetic dipole moment operators (<math>\\widehat{M}_{(elec. dipole)}</math> and <math>\\widehat{M}_{(mag. dipole)}</math>) must transform as the same [[group theory|irreducible representation]]. <math>C_n</math> and <math>D_n </math> are the only [[point groups]] where this can occur, making only chiral molecules CD active.\n\nSimply put, since circularly polarized light itself is \"chiral\", it interacts differently with [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral molecules]]. That is, the two types of circularly polarized light are absorbed to different extents. In a CD experiment, equal amounts of left and right circularly polarized light of a selected wavelength are alternately radiated into a (chiral) sample. One of the two polarizations is absorbed more than the other one, and this wavelength-dependent difference of absorption is measured, yielding the CD spectrum of the sample. Due to the interaction with the molecule, the electric field vector of the light traces out an elliptical path after passing through the sample.\n\nIt is important that the chirality of the molecule can be conformational rather than structural. That is, for instance, a protein molecule with a helical [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] can have a CD that changes with changes in the conformation.\n\n====Delta absorbance====\nBy definition,\n\n:<math>\\Delta A=A_L-A_R \\,</math>\n\nwhere \u0394A (Delta Absorbance) is the difference between absorbance of left circularly polarized (LCP) and right circularly polarized (RCP) light (this is what is usually measured). \u0394A is a function of [[wavelength]], so for a measurement to be meaningful the wavelength at which it was performed must be known.\n\n====Molar circular dichroism====\nIt can also be expressed, by applying [[Beer-Lambert law|Beer's law]], as:\n\n:<math>\\Delta A = (\\epsilon_L - \\epsilon_R)Cl\\,</math>\n\nwhere\n:\u03b5<sub>L</sub> and \u03b5<sub>R</sub> are the molar extinction coefficients for LCP and RCP light,\n:''C'' is the [[molar concentration]],\n:''l'' is the path length in centimeters (cm).\n\nThen\n\n:<math> \\Delta \\epsilon =\\epsilon_L-\\epsilon_R\\,</math>\n\nis the molar circular dichroism. This intrinsic property is what is usually meant by the circular dichroism of the substance. Since <math> \\Delta \\epsilon</math> is a function of wavelength, a molar circular dichroism value (<math> \\Delta \\epsilon</math>) must specify the wavelength at which it is valid.\n\n====Extrinsic effects on circular dichroism====\nIn many practical applications of circular dichroism (CD), as discussed below, the measured CD is not simply an intrinsic property of the molecule, but rather depends on the molecular conformation. In such a case the CD may also be a function of temperature, concentration, and the chemical environment, including solvents. In this case the reported CD value must also specify these other relevant factors in order to be meaningful.\n\n====Molar ellipticity====\n\nAlthough \u0394A is usually measured, for historical reasons most measurements are reported in degrees of ellipticity.\nMolar ellipticity is circular dichroism corrected for concentration. Molar circular dichroism and molar ellipticity, [''\u03b8''], are readily interconverted by the equation:\n\n[[File:Electric Vectors 1.png|thumb|Electric_Vectors|200px|right|Elliptical polarized light (violet) is composed of unequal contributions of right (blue) and left (red) circular polarized light.]]\n\n:<math> [\\theta] = 3298.2\\,\\Delta \\varepsilon.\\, </math>\n\nThis relationship is derived by defining the [[polarization (waves)|ellipticity of the polarization]] as:\n\n:<math> \\tan \\theta = \\frac{E_R - E_L}{E_R + E_L} \\,</math>\n\nwhere\n:E<sub>R</sub> and E<sub>L</sub> are the magnitudes of the [[electric field]] [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] of the right-circularly and left-circularly polarized light, respectively.\n\nWhen E<sub>R</sub> equals E<sub>L</sub> (when there is no difference in the absorbance of right- and left-circular polarized light), \u03b8 is 0\u00b0 and the light is [[linear polarization|linearly polarized]]. When either E<sub>R</sub> or E<sub>L</sub> is equal to zero (when there is complete absorbance of the circular polarized light in one direction), \u03b8 is 45\u00b0 and the light is [[circular polarization|circularly polarized]].\n\nGenerally, the circular dichroism effect is small, so tan\u03b8 is small and can be approximated as \u03b8 in [[radian]]s. Since the [[Radiant intensity|intensity]] or [[irradiance]], I, of light is proportional to the square of the electric-field vector, the ellipticity becomes:\n\n:<math> \\theta (\\text{radians}) = \\frac{(I_R^{1/2} - I_L^{1/2})}{(I_R^{1/2} + I_L^{1/2})}\\,</math>\n\nThen by substituting for I using [[Beer\u2013Lambert law|Beer's law]] in [[natural logarithm]] form:\n\n:<math> I = I_0 e^{-A\\ln 10}\\,</math>\n\nThe ellipticity can now be written as:\n\n:<math> \\theta (\\text{radians}) = \\frac{(e^{\\frac{-A_R}{2}\\ln 10} - e^{\\frac{-A_L}{2}\\ln 10})}{(e^{\\frac{-A_R}{2}\\ln 10} + e^{\\frac{-A_L}{2}\\ln 10})} = \\frac{e^{\\Delta A \\frac{\\ln 10}{2}} - 1}{e^{\\Delta A \\frac{\\ln 10}{2}} + 1} \\,</math>\n\nSince \u0394A&nbsp;<<&nbsp;1, this expression can be approximated by expanding the exponentials in a [[Taylor series]] to first-order and then discarding terms of \u0394A in comparison with unity and converting from [[radian]]s to degrees:\n\n:<math> \\theta (\\text{degrees}) = \\Delta A \\left( \\frac {\\ln 10}{4} \\right) \\left( \\frac {180}{\\pi} \\right)\\, </math>\n\nThe linear dependence of solute concentration and pathlength is removed by defining molar ellipticity as,\n\n:<math> [\\theta] = \\frac {100\\theta}{\\text{Cl}}\\, </math>\n\nThen combining the last two expression with [[Beer\u2013Lambert law|Beer's law]], molar ellipticity becomes:\n\n:<math> [\\theta]= 100 \\,\\Delta \\varepsilon \\left( \\frac {\\ln 10}{4} \\right) \\left( \\frac {180}{\\pi} \\right) = 3298.2\\,\\Delta \\varepsilon \\,</math>\n\nThe units of molar ellipticity are historically (deg\u00b7cm<sup>2</sup>/dmol). To calculate molar ellipticity, the sample concentration (g/L), cell pathlength (cm), and the molecular weight (g/mol) must be known.\n\nIf the sample is a protein, the mean residue weight (average molecular weight of the amino acid residues it contains) is often used in place of the molecular weight, essentially treating the protein as a solution of amino acids. Using mean residue ellipticity facilitates comparing the CD of proteins of different molecular weight; use of this normalized CD is important in studies of protein structure.\n\n====Mean residue ellipticity====\nMethods for estimating secondary structure in polymers, proteins and polypeptides in particular, often require that the measured molar ellipticity spectrum be converted to a normalized value, specifically a value independent of the polymer length. Mean residue ellipticity is used for this purpose; it is simply the measured molar ellipticity of the molecule divided by the number of monomer units (residues) in the molecule.\n\n==Application to biological molecules==\n[[File:Circular dichroism and structures calculation-protein in detergents.svg|thumb|400px|Upper panel: Circular dichroism spectroscopy in the ultraviolet wavelength region (UV-CD) of MBP-cytochrome b<sub>6</sub> fusion protein in different detergent solutions.

As a consequence, circular dichroism is exhibited by biological molecules, because of their [[dextrorotary]] and [[levorotary]] components. Even more important is that a [[secondary structure]] will also impart a distinct CD to its respective molecules. Therefore, the [[alpha helix]] of proteins and the [[double helix]] of [[nucleic acids]] have CD spectral signatures representative of their structures.  The capacity of CD to give a representative structural signature makes it a powerful tool in modern biochemistry with applications that can be found in virtually every field of study.\n\nCD is closely related to the [[optical rotatory dispersion]] (ORD) technique, and is generally considered to be more advanced. CD is measured in or near the absorption bands of the molecule of interest, while ORD can be measured far from these bands. CD's advantage is apparent in the data analysis. Structural elements are more clearly distinguished since their recorded bands do not overlap extensively at particular wavelengths as they do in ORD. In principle these two spectral measurements can be interconverted through an integral transform ([[Kramers\u2013Kronig relation]]), if all the absorptions are included in the measurements.\n\nThe far-UV ([[ultraviolet]]) CD spectrum of proteins can reveal important characteristics of their [[secondary structure]]. CD spectra can be readily used to estimate the fraction of a molecule that is in the [[alpha-helix]] conformation, the [[beta-sheet]] conformation, the [[beta-turn]] conformation, or some other (e.g. [[random coil]]) conformation.<ref name=\"pmid17896349\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitmore L, Wallace BA |title=Protein secondary structure analyses from circular dichroism spectroscopy: methods and reference databases |journal=Biopolymers |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=392\u2013400 |year=2008|pmid=17896349 |doi=10.1002/bip.20853}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid17406547\">{{cite journal |author=Greenfield NJ |title=Using circular dichroism spectra to estimate protein secondary structure |journal=Nature Protocols |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=2876\u201390 |year=2006 |pmid=17406547 |doi=10.1038/nprot.2006.202 |pmc=2728378}}</ref> These fractional assignments place important constraints on the possible secondary conformations that the protein can be in. CD cannot, in general, say where the alpha helices that are detected are located within the molecule or even completely predict how many there are. Despite this, CD is a valuable tool, especially for showing changes in conformation. It can, for instance, be used to study how the secondary structure of a molecule changes as a function of temperature or of the concentration of denaturing agents, e.g. [[Guanidine|Guanidinium chloride]] or [[urea]]. In this way it can reveal important thermodynamic information about the molecule (such as the [[enthalpy]] and [[Gibbs free energy]] of denaturation) that cannot otherwise be easily obtained. Anyone attempting to study a protein will find CD a valuable tool for verifying that the protein is in its native conformation before undertaking extensive and/or expensive experiments with it. Also, there are a number of other uses for CD spectroscopy in protein chemistry not related to alpha-helix fraction estimation. Moreover, CD spectroscopy has been used in bioinorganic interface studies. Specifically it has been used to analyze the differences in secondary structure of an  engineered protein before and after titration with a reagent.<ref>Bioinorganic Interface: Mechanistic Studies of Protein-Directed Nanomaterial Synthesis.

Retrieved March 1, 2019, from https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b02569</ref>\n\nThe near-UV CD spectrum (>250&nbsp;nm) of proteins provides information on the [[tertiary structure]]. The signals obtained in the 250\u2013300&nbsp;nm region are due to the absorption, dipole orientation and the nature of the surrounding environment of the phenylalanine, tyrosine, cysteine (or S-S [[disulfide bond|disulfide bridges]]) and tryptophan [[amino acid]]s. Unlike in far-UV CD, the near-UV CD spectrum cannot be assigned to any particular 3D structure. Rather, near-UV CD spectra provide structural information on the nature of the prosthetic groups in proteins, e.g., the heme groups in [[hemoglobin]] and [[cytochrome c]].\n\nVisible CD spectroscopy is a very powerful technique to study metal\u2013protein interactions and can resolve individual d\u2013d electronic transitions as separate bands. CD spectra in the visible light region are only produced when a metal ion is in a chiral environment, thus, free metal ions in solution are not detected. This has the advantage of only observing the protein-bound metal, so pH dependence and stoichiometries are readily obtained. Optical activity in transition metal ion complexes have been attributed to configurational, conformational and the vicinal effects. Klewpatinond and Viles (2007) have produced a set of empirical rules for predicting the appearance of visible CD spectra for Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup> square-planar complexes involving histidine and main-chain coordination.\n\nCD gives less specific structural information than [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[protein NMR]] spectroscopy, for example, which both give atomic resolution data. However, CD spectroscopy is a quick method that does not require large amounts of proteins or extensive data processing. Thus CD can be used to survey a large number of [[solvent]] conditions, varying [[temperature]], [[pH]], [[salinity]], and the presence of various cofactors.\n\nCD [[spectroscopy]] is usually used to study proteins in solution, and thus it complements methods that study the solid state. This is also a limitation, in that many proteins are embedded in [[biological membrane|membranes]] in their native state, and solutions containing membrane structures are often strongly scattering. CD is sometimes measured in thin films.\n\nCD [[spectroscopy]] has also been done using semiconducting materials such as TiO<sub>2</sub> to obtain large signals in the UV range of wavelengths, where the electronic transitions for biomolecules often occur.<ref>Sarkar, Sumant, Ryan Behunin, and John G. Gibbs. \"Shape-Dependent, Chiro-Optical Response of UV-Active, Nanohelix Metamaterials.\" Nano letters (2019). https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b03274</ref>\n\n==Experimental limitations==\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2010}}\n\nCD has also been studied in [[carbohydrates]], but with limited success due to the experimental difficulties associated with measurement of CD spectra in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region of the spectrum (100\u2013200&nbsp;nm), where the corresponding CD bands of unsubstituted carbohydrates lie. Substituted carbohydrates with bands above the VUV region have been successfully measured.\n\nMeasurement of CD is also complicated by the fact that typical aqueous buffer systems often absorb in the range where structural features exhibit differential absorption of circularly polarized light. [[Phosphate]], [[sulfate]], [[carbonate]], and [[acetate]] buffers are generally incompatible with CD unless made extremely dilute e.g. in the 10\u201350 mM range. The TRIS buffer system should be completely avoided when performing far-UV CD. [[Borate]] and [[Onium compounds]] are often used to establish the appropriate pH range for CD experiments. Some experimenters have substituted fluoride for chloride ion because fluoride absorbs less in the far UV, and some have worked in pure water. Another, almost universal, technique is to minimize solvent absorption by using shorter path length cells when working in the far UV, 0.1&nbsp;mm path lengths are not uncommon in this work.\n\nIn addition to measuring in aqueous systems, CD, particularly far-UV CD, can be measured in organic solvents e.g. ethanol, methanol, [[trifluoroethanol]] (TFE). The latter has the advantage to induce structure formation of proteins, inducing beta-sheets in some and alpha helices in others, which they would not show under normal aqueous conditions. Most common organic solvents such as [[acetonitrile]], [[THF]], [[chloroform]], [[dichloromethane]] are however, incompatible with far-UV CD.\n\nIt may be of interest to note that the protein CD spectra used in secondary structure estimation are related to the \u03c0 to \u03c0* orbital absorptions of the [[amide bond]]s linking the amino acids. These absorption bands lie partly in the ''so-called'' [[Vacuum ultraviolet#Vacuum UV|vacuum ultraviolet]] (wavelengths less than about 200&nbsp;nm). The wavelength region of interest is actually inaccessible in air because of the strong absorption of light by [[oxygen]] at these wavelengths. In practice these spectra are measured not in vacuum but in an oxygen-free instrument (filled with pure [[nitrogen]] gas).\n\nOnce oxygen has been eliminated, perhaps the second most important technical factor in working below 200&nbsp;nm is to design the rest of the optical system to have low losses in this region. Critical in this regard is the use of [[Mirror#Instruments|aluminized mirrors]] whose coatings have been optimized for low loss in this region of the spectrum.\n\nThe usual light source in these instruments is a high pressure, short-arc [[Xenon arc lamp|xenon lamp]]. Ordinary xenon arc lamps are unsuitable for use in the low UV. Instead, specially constructed lamps with envelopes made from high-purity synthetic [[fused silica]] must be used.\n\nLight from [[synchrotron]] sources has a much higher flux at short wavelengths, and has been used to record CD down to 160&nbsp;nm. In 2010 the CD spectrophotometer at the electron storage ring facility ISA at the University of [[Aarhus]] in Denmark was used to record solid state CD spectra down to 120&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=U.

While [[Polarization (waves)|linearly polarized]] light occurs when the electric field vector oscillates only in one plane, circularly polarized light occurs when the direction of the electric field vector rotates about its propagation direction while the vector retains constant magnitude. At a single point in space, the circularly polarized-vector will trace out a circle over one period of the wave frequency, hence the name. The two diagrams below show the electric field vectors of linearly and circularly polarized light, at one moment of time, for a range of positions; the plot of the circularly polarized electric vector forms a helix along the direction of propagation (k). For left circularly polarized light (LCP) with propagation towards the observer, the electric vector rotates [[clockwise|counterclockwise]].<ref name=\"E. I. Solomon and A. B. P. Lever 2006 78\"/> For right circularly polarized light (RCP), the electric vector rotates clockwise.\n\n[[File:Linearly pol.png]]     [[File:Circularly pol.png]]\n\n===Interaction of circularly polarized light with matter===\nWhen circularly polarized light passes through an absorbing optically active medium, the speeds between right and left polarizations differ (c<sub>L</sub> \u2260 c<sub>R</sub>) as well as their [[wavelength]] (\u03bb<sub>L</sub> \u2260 \u03bb<sub>R</sub>) and the extent to which they are absorbed (\u03b5<sub>L</sub>\u2260\u03b5<sub>R</sub>). ''Circular dichroism'' is the difference \u0394\u03b5 \u2261 \u03b5<sub>L</sub>- \u03b5<sub>R</sub>.<ref name=b1/> The electric field of a light beam causes a linear displacement of charge when interacting with a molecule ([[electric dipole]]), whereas its magnetic field causes a circulation of charge ([[magnetic dipole]]). These two motions combined cause an excitation of an [[electron]] in a helical motion, which includes [[translation (physics)|translation]] and [[rotation]] and their associated [[Operator (mathematics)|operators]]. The experimentally determined relationship between the [[rotational strength]] (R) of a sample and the \u0394\u03b5 is given by\n:<math>R_{exp} = \\frac{3hc10^{3} \\ln(10)}{32\\pi^{3}N_A} \\int \\frac{\\Delta\\epsilon}{\\nu} d{\\nu}</math>\nThe rotational strength has also been determined theoretically,\n:<math>R_{theo} = \\frac{1}{2mc} Im \\int \\Psi_g \\widehat{M}_{(elec. dipole)} \\Psi_e d\\tau \\bullet \\int \\Psi_g \\widehat{M}_{(mag. dipole)} \\Psi_e d\\tau </math>\nWe see from these two equations that in order to have non-zero <math>\\Delta\\epsilon</math>, the electric and magnetic dipole moment operators (<math>\\widehat{M}_{(elec. dipole)}</math> and <math>\\widehat{M}_{(mag. dipole)}</math>) must transform as the same [[group theory|irreducible representation]]. <math>C_n</math> and <math>D_n </math> are the only [[point groups]] where this can occur, making only chiral molecules CD active.\n\nSimply put, since circularly polarized light itself is \"chiral\", it interacts differently with [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral molecules]]. That is, the two types of circularly polarized light are absorbed to different extents. In a CD experiment, equal amounts of left and right circularly polarized light of a selected wavelength are alternately radiated into a (chiral) sample. One of the two polarizations is absorbed more than the other one, and this wavelength-dependent difference of absorption is measured, yielding the CD spectrum of the sample. Due to the interaction with the molecule, the electric field vector of the light traces out an elliptical path after passing through the sample.\n\nIt is important that the chirality of the molecule can be conformational rather than structural. That is, for instance, a protein molecule with a helical [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] can have a CD that changes with changes in the conformation.\n\n====Delta absorbance====\nBy definition,\n\n:<math>\\Delta A=A_L-A_R \\,</math>\n\nwhere \u0394A (Delta Absorbance) is the difference between absorbance of left circularly polarized (LCP) and right circularly polarized (RCP) light (this is what is usually measured). \u0394A is a function of [[wavelength]], so for a measurement to be meaningful the wavelength at which it was performed must be known.\n\n====Molar circular dichroism====\nIt can also be expressed, by applying [[Beer-Lambert law|Beer's law]], as:\n\n:<math>\\Delta A = (\\epsilon_L - \\epsilon_R)Cl\\,</math>\n\nwhere\n:\u03b5<sub>L</sub> and \u03b5<sub>R</sub> are the molar extinction coefficients for LCP and RCP light,\n:''C'' is the [[molar concentration]],\n:''l'' is the path length in centimeters (cm).\n\nThen\n\n:<math> \\Delta \\epsilon =\\epsilon_L-\\epsilon_R\\,</math>\n\nis the molar circular dichroism. This intrinsic property is what is usually meant by the circular dichroism of the substance. Since <math> \\Delta \\epsilon</math> is a function of wavelength, a molar circular dichroism value (<math> \\Delta \\epsilon</math>) must specify the wavelength at which it is valid.\n\n====Extrinsic effects on circular dichroism====\nIn many practical applications of circular dichroism (CD), as discussed below, the measured CD is not simply an intrinsic property of the molecule, but rather depends on the molecular conformation. In such a case the CD may also be a function of temperature, concentration, and the chemical environment, including solvents. In this case the reported CD value must also specify these other relevant factors in order to be meaningful.\n\n====Molar ellipticity====\n\nAlthough \u0394A is usually measured, for historical reasons most measurements are reported in degrees of ellipticity.\nMolar ellipticity is circular dichroism corrected for concentration. Molar circular dichroism and molar ellipticity, [''\u03b8''], are readily interconverted by the equation:\n\n[[File:Electric Vectors 1.png|thumb|Electric_Vectors|200px|right|Elliptical polarized light (violet) is composed of unequal contributions of right (blue) and left (red) circular polarized light.]]\n\n:<math> [\\theta] = 3298.2\\,\\Delta \\varepsilon.\\, </math>\n\nThis relationship is derived by defining the [[polarization (waves)|ellipticity of the polarization]] as:\n\n:<math> \\tan \\theta = \\frac{E_R - E_L}{E_R + E_L} \\,</math>\n\nwhere\n:E<sub>R</sub> and E<sub>L</sub> are the magnitudes of the [[electric field]] [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] of the right-circularly and left-circularly polarized light, respectively.\n\nWhen E<sub>R</sub> equals E<sub>L</sub> (when there is no difference in the absorbance of right- and left-circular polarized light), \u03b8 is 0\u00b0 and the light is [[linear polarization|linearly polarized]]. When either E<sub>R</sub> or E<sub>L</sub> is equal to zero (when there is complete absorbance of the circular polarized light in one direction), \u03b8 is 45\u00b0 and the light is [[circular polarization|circularly polarized]].\n\nGenerally, the circular dichroism effect is small, so tan\u03b8 is small and can be approximated as \u03b8 in [[radian]]s. Since the [[Radiant intensity|intensity]] or [[irradiance]], I, of light is proportional to the square of the electric-field vector, the ellipticity becomes:\n\n:<math> \\theta (\\text{radians}) = \\frac{(I_R^{1/2} - I_L^{1/2})}{(I_R^{1/2} + I_L^{1/2})}\\,</math>\n\nThen by substituting for I using [[Beer\u2013Lambert law|Beer's law]] in [[natural logarithm]] form:\n\n:<math> I = I_0 e^{-A\\ln 10}\\,</math>\n\nThe ellipticity can now be written as:\n\n:<math> \\theta (\\text{radians}) = \\frac{(e^{\\frac{-A_R}{2}\\ln 10} - e^{\\frac{-A_L}{2}\\ln 10})}{(e^{\\frac{-A_R}{2}\\ln 10} + e^{\\frac{-A_L}{2}\\ln 10})} = \\frac{e^{\\Delta A \\frac{\\ln 10}{2}} - 1}{e^{\\Delta A \\frac{\\ln 10}{2}} + 1} \\,</math>\n\nSince \u0394A&nbsp;<<&nbsp;1, this expression can be approximated by expanding the exponentials in a [[Taylor series]] to first-order and then discarding terms of \u0394A in comparison with unity and converting from [[radian]]s to degrees:\n\n:<math> \\theta (\\text{degrees}) = \\Delta A \\left( \\frac {\\ln 10}{4} \\right) \\left( \\frac {180}{\\pi} \\right)\\, </math>\n\nThe linear dependence of solute concentration and pathlength is removed by defining molar ellipticity as,\n\n:<math> [\\theta] = \\frac {100\\theta}{\\text{Cl}}\\, </math>\n\nThen combining the last two expression with [[Beer\u2013Lambert law|Beer's law]], molar ellipticity becomes:\n\n:<math> [\\theta]= 100 \\,\\Delta \\varepsilon \\left( \\frac {\\ln 10}{4} \\right) \\left( \\frac {180}{\\pi} \\right) = 3298.2\\,\\Delta \\varepsilon \\,</math>\n\nThe units of molar ellipticity are historically (deg\u00b7cm<sup>2</sup>/dmol). To calculate molar ellipticity, the sample concentration (g/L), cell pathlength (cm), and the molecular weight (g/mol) must be known.\n\nIf the sample is a protein, the mean residue weight (average molecular weight of the amino acid residues it contains) is often used in place of the molecular weight, essentially treating the protein as a solution of amino acids. Using mean residue ellipticity facilitates comparing the CD of proteins of different molecular weight; use of this normalized CD is important in studies of protein structure.\n\n====Mean residue ellipticity====\nMethods for estimating secondary structure in polymers, proteins and polypeptides in particular, often require that the measured molar ellipticity spectrum be converted to a normalized value, specifically a value independent of the polymer length. Mean residue ellipticity is used for this purpose; it is simply the measured molar ellipticity of the molecule divided by the number of monomer units (residues) in the molecule.\n\n==Application to biological molecules==\n[[File:Circular dichroism and structures calculation-protein in detergents.svg|thumb|400px|Upper panel: Circular dichroism spectroscopy in the ultraviolet wavelength region (UV-CD) of MBP-cytochrome b<sub>6</sub> fusion protein in different detergent solutions. It shows that the protein in DM, as well as in Triton X-100 solution, recovered its structure.

As a consequence, circular dichroism is exhibited by biological molecules, because of their [[dextrorotary]] and [[levorotary]] components. Even more important is that a [[secondary structure]] will also impart a distinct CD to its respective molecules. Therefore, the [[alpha helix]] of proteins and the [[double helix]] of [[nucleic acids]] have CD spectral signatures representative of their structures.  The capacity of CD to give a representative structural signature makes it a powerful tool in modern biochemistry with applications that can be found in virtually every field of study.\n\nCD is closely related to the [[optical rotatory dispersion]] (ORD) technique, and is generally considered to be more advanced. CD is measured in or near the absorption bands of the molecule of interest, while ORD can be measured far from these bands. CD's advantage is apparent in the data analysis. Structural elements are more clearly distinguished since their recorded bands do not overlap extensively at particular wavelengths as they do in ORD. In principle these two spectral measurements can be interconverted through an integral transform ([[Kramers\u2013Kronig relation]]), if all the absorptions are included in the measurements.\n\nThe far-UV ([[ultraviolet]]) CD spectrum of proteins can reveal important characteristics of their [[secondary structure]]. CD spectra can be readily used to estimate the fraction of a molecule that is in the [[alpha-helix]] conformation, the [[beta-sheet]] conformation, the [[beta-turn]] conformation, or some other (e.g. [[random coil]]) conformation.<ref name=\"pmid17896349\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitmore L, Wallace BA |title=Protein secondary structure analyses from circular dichroism spectroscopy: methods and reference databases |journal=Biopolymers |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=392\u2013400 |year=2008|pmid=17896349 |doi=10.1002/bip.20853}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid17406547\">{{cite journal |author=Greenfield NJ |title=Using circular dichroism spectra to estimate protein secondary structure |journal=Nature Protocols |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=2876\u201390 |year=2006 |pmid=17406547 |doi=10.1038/nprot.2006.202 |pmc=2728378}}</ref> These fractional assignments place important constraints on the possible secondary conformations that the protein can be in. CD cannot, in general, say where the alpha helices that are detected are located within the molecule or even completely predict how many there are. Despite this, CD is a valuable tool, especially for showing changes in conformation. It can, for instance, be used to study how the secondary structure of a molecule changes as a function of temperature or of the concentration of denaturing agents, e.g. [[Guanidine|Guanidinium chloride]] or [[urea]]. In this way it can reveal important thermodynamic information about the molecule (such as the [[enthalpy]] and [[Gibbs free energy]] of denaturation) that cannot otherwise be easily obtained. Anyone attempting to study a protein will find CD a valuable tool for verifying that the protein is in its native conformation before undertaking extensive and/or expensive experiments with it. Also, there are a number of other uses for CD spectroscopy in protein chemistry not related to alpha-helix fraction estimation. Moreover, CD spectroscopy has been used in bioinorganic interface studies. Specifically it has been used to analyze the differences in secondary structure of an  engineered protein before and after titration with a reagent.<ref>Bioinorganic Interface: Mechanistic Studies of Protein-Directed Nanomaterial Synthesis.

Retrieved March 1, 2019, from https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b02569</ref>\n\nThe near-UV CD spectrum (>250&nbsp;nm) of proteins provides information on the [[tertiary structure]]. The signals obtained in the 250\u2013300&nbsp;nm region are due to the absorption, dipole orientation and the nature of the surrounding environment of the phenylalanine, tyrosine, cysteine (or S-S [[disulfide bond|disulfide bridges]]) and tryptophan [[amino acid]]s. Unlike in far-UV CD, the near-UV CD spectrum cannot be assigned to any particular 3D structure. Rather, near-UV CD spectra provide structural information on the nature of the prosthetic groups in proteins, e.g., the heme groups in [[hemoglobin]] and [[cytochrome c]].\n\nVisible CD spectroscopy is a very powerful technique to study metal\u2013protein interactions and can resolve individual d\u2013d electronic transitions as separate bands. CD spectra in the visible light region are only produced when a metal ion is in a chiral environment, thus, free metal ions in solution are not detected. This has the advantage of only observing the protein-bound metal, so pH dependence and stoichiometries are readily obtained. Optical activity in transition metal ion complexes have been attributed to configurational, conformational and the vicinal effects. Klewpatinond and Viles (2007) have produced a set of empirical rules for predicting the appearance of visible CD spectra for Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup> square-planar complexes involving histidine and main-chain coordination.\n\nCD gives less specific structural information than [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[protein NMR]] spectroscopy, for example, which both give atomic resolution data. However, CD spectroscopy is a quick method that does not require large amounts of proteins or extensive data processing. Thus CD can be used to survey a large number of [[solvent]] conditions, varying [[temperature]], [[pH]], [[salinity]], and the presence of various cofactors.\n\nCD [[spectroscopy]] is usually used to study proteins in solution, and thus it complements methods that study the solid state. This is also a limitation, in that many proteins are embedded in [[biological membrane|membranes]] in their native state, and solutions containing membrane structures are often strongly scattering. CD is sometimes measured in thin films.\n\nCD [[spectroscopy]] has also been done using semiconducting materials such as TiO<sub>2</sub> to obtain large signals in the UV range of wavelengths, where the electronic transitions for biomolecules often occur.<ref>Sarkar, Sumant, Ryan Behunin, and John G. Gibbs. \"Shape-Dependent, Chiro-Optical Response of UV-Active, Nanohelix Metamaterials.\" Nano letters (2019). https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b03274</ref>\n\n==Experimental limitations==\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2010}}\n\nCD has also been studied in [[carbohydrates]], but with limited success due to the experimental difficulties associated with measurement of CD spectra in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region of the spectrum (100\u2013200&nbsp;nm), where the corresponding CD bands of unsubstituted carbohydrates lie. Substituted carbohydrates with bands above the VUV region have been successfully measured.\n\nMeasurement of CD is also complicated by the fact that typical aqueous buffer systems often absorb in the range where structural features exhibit differential absorption of circularly polarized light. [[Phosphate]], [[sulfate]], [[carbonate]], and [[acetate]] buffers are generally incompatible with CD unless made extremely dilute e.g. in the 10\u201350 mM range. The TRIS buffer system should be completely avoided when performing far-UV CD. [[Borate]] and [[Onium compounds]] are often used to establish the appropriate pH range for CD experiments. Some experimenters have substituted fluoride for chloride ion because fluoride absorbs less in the far UV, and some have worked in pure water. Another, almost universal, technique is to minimize solvent absorption by using shorter path length cells when working in the far UV, 0.1&nbsp;mm path lengths are not uncommon in this work.\n\nIn addition to measuring in aqueous systems, CD, particularly far-UV CD, can be measured in organic solvents e.g. ethanol, methanol, [[trifluoroethanol]] (TFE). The latter has the advantage to induce structure formation of proteins, inducing beta-sheets in some and alpha helices in others, which they would not show under normal aqueous conditions. Most common organic solvents such as [[acetonitrile]], [[THF]], [[chloroform]], [[dichloromethane]] are however, incompatible with far-UV CD.\n\nIt may be of interest to note that the protein CD spectra used in secondary structure estimation are related to the \u03c0 to \u03c0* orbital absorptions of the [[amide bond]]s linking the amino acids. These absorption bands lie partly in the ''so-called'' [[Vacuum ultraviolet#Vacuum UV|vacuum ultraviolet]] (wavelengths less than about 200&nbsp;nm). The wavelength region of interest is actually inaccessible in air because of the strong absorption of light by [[oxygen]] at these wavelengths. In practice these spectra are measured not in vacuum but in an oxygen-free instrument (filled with pure [[nitrogen]] gas).\n\nOnce oxygen has been eliminated, perhaps the second most important technical factor in working below 200&nbsp;nm is to design the rest of the optical system to have low losses in this region. Critical in this regard is the use of [[Mirror#Instruments|aluminized mirrors]] whose coatings have been optimized for low loss in this region of the spectrum.\n\nThe usual light source in these instruments is a high pressure, short-arc [[Xenon arc lamp|xenon lamp]]. Ordinary xenon arc lamps are unsuitable for use in the low UV. Instead, specially constructed lamps with envelopes made from high-purity synthetic [[fused silica]] must be used.\n\nLight from [[synchrotron]] sources has a much higher flux at short wavelengths, and has been used to record CD down to 160&nbsp;nm. In 2010 the CD spectrophotometer at the electron storage ring facility ISA at the University of [[Aarhus]] in Denmark was used to record solid state CD spectra down to 120&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=U.

These attempts were most successful in the 1934\u20131952 period.

Most of the documents he relies on were written by enemies of the Ottoman Empire, or by officials with limited experience of the Ottoman Balkans... Malcolm, like the historians of Serbia and Yugoslavia who ignore his findings, overlooks the most valuable indigenous evidence.

The conservative [[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]] commissioned the ''Atarashii Rekishi Ky\u014dkasho'' textbook with the purpose of traditional national and international view of that Japanese historical period. The Ministry of Education vets all history textbooks, and those that do not mention Japanese war crimes and atrocities are not vetted;{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} however, the ''Atarashii Rekishi Ky\u014dkasho'' de-emphasizes aggressive Japanese Imperial wartime behaviour and the matter of Chinese and Korean [[comfort women]].

Section and the authoritarian dictatorships in South Korea during 1960s\u20131980s.The Ministry of Education announced that it would put the secondary-school history textbook under state control; \"This was an inevitable choice in order to straighten out historical errors and end the social dispute caused by ideological bias in the textbooks,\" Hwang Woo-yea, education minister said on 12 October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20151012000678|title=Ministry unveils plan for history textbook publication system|first=The Korea|last=Herald|date=12 October 2015|accessdate=17 October 2016}}</ref> According to the government's plan, the current history textbooks of South Korea will be replaced by a single textbook written by a panel of government-appointed historians and the new series of publications would be issued under the title ''The Correct Textbook of History'' and are to be issued to the public and private primary and secondary schools in 2017 onwards.\n\nThe move has sparked fierce criticism from academics who argue the system can be used to distort the history and glorify the history of those who served the Imperial Japanese government ([[Chinilpa]]) and of the authoritarian dictatorships. Moreover, 466 organizations including Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union formed History Act Network in solidarity and have staged protests: \"The government's decision allows the state too much control and power and, therefore, it is against political neutrality that is certainly the fundamental principle of education.\" Many South Korean historians condemned [[Kyohaksa]] for their text glorifying those who served the Imperial Japanese government (Chinilpa) and the authoritarian dictatorship with a far-right political perspective. On the other hand, New Right supporters welcomed the textbook saying that 'the new textbook finally describes historical truths contrary to the history textbooks published by left-wing publishers,' and the textbook issue became intensified as a case of ideological conflict.\n\nIn fact, there once was a time in Korean history that the history textbook was put under state control. It was during the authoritarian regime under [[Park Chung-hee]] (1963&ndash;1979), who is a father of Park Geun-hye, former President of South Korea, and was used as a means to keep the [[Fourth Republic of Korea|Yushin Regime]] (also known as Yushin Dictatorship). However, there had been continuous criticisms about the system especially from the 1980s when Korea experienced a dramatic democratic development. In 2003, liberalization of textbook began when the textbooks on Korean modern and contemporary history were published though the Textbook Screening System, which allows textbooks to be published not by a single government body but by many different companies, for the first time.\n\n====Turkey====\n[[Education in Turkey]] is centralized: its policy, administration and content are each determined by the Turkish government. Textbooks taught in schools are either prepared directly by the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education (MEB)]] or must be approved by its Instruction and Education Board. In practice, this means that the Turkish government is directly responsible for what textbooks are taught in schools across Turkey.<ref name=armenianweekly>[http://armenianweekly.com/2014/12/04/textbooks/ Akcam: Textbooks and the Armenian Genocide in Turkey: Heading Towards 2015], ''[[Armenian Weekly]]''</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Taner Ak\u00e7am]], writing for the ''[[Armenian Weekly]]'', discussed 2014\u20132015 Turkish elementary and middle school textbooks that the MEB had made available on the internet. He found that Turkish history textbooks are filled with the message that Armenians are people \"who are incited by foreigners, who aim to break apart the state and the country, and who murdered Turks and Muslims.\" The Armenian Genocide is referred to as the \"Armenian matter\", and is described as a lie perpetrated in order to further the perceived hidden agenda of Armenians. Recognition of the Armenian Genocide is defined as the \"biggest threat to Turkish national security\".<ref name=armenianweekly/>\n\nAk\u00e7am summarized one textbook that claims the Armenians had sided with the Russians during the war. The 1909 [[Adana massacre]], in which as many as 20,000\u201330,000 Armenians were massacred, is identified as \"The Rebellion of Armenians of Adana\". According to the book, the Armenian [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party|Hnchak]] and [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnak]] organizations instituted rebellions in many parts of [[Anatolia]], and \"didn't hesitate to kill Armenians who would not join them,\" issuing instructions that \"if you want to survive you have to kill your neighbor first.\" Claims highlighted by Ak\u00e7am:<ref name=armenianweekly/> <BLOCKQUOTE>[The Armenians murdered] many people living in villages, even children, by attacking Turkish villages, which had become defenseless because all the Turkish men were fighting on the war fronts. ... They stabbed the Ottoman forces in the back. They created obstacles for the operations of the Ottoman units by cutting off their supply routes and destroying bridges and roads. ... They spied for Russia and by rebelling in the cities where they were located, they eased the way for the Russian invasion. ... Since the Armenians who engaged in massacres in collaboration with the Russians created a dangerous situation, this law required the migration of [Armenian people] from the towns they were living in to Syria, a safe Ottoman territory. ... Despite being in the midst of war, the Ottoman state took precautions and measures when it came to the Armenians who were migrating. Their tax payments were postponed, they were permitted to take any personal property they wished, government officials were assigned to ensure that they were protected from attacks during the journey and that their needs were met, police stations were established to ensure that their lives and properties were secure.</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\nSimilar revisionist claims found in other textbooks by Ak\u00e7am included that Armenian \"back-stabbing\" was the reason the Ottomans lost the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]] (similar to the post-War German [[stab-in-the-back myth]]), that the [[Hamidian massacres]] never happened, that the Armenians were armed by the Russians during late [[World War I]] to fight the Ottomans (in reality they had already been nearly annihilated from the area by this point), that Armenians killed 600,000 Turks during said war, that the deportation were to save Armenians from other violent Armenian gangs, and that Armenians who were deported were later able to return to Turkey unscathed and reclaim their properties.<ref name=armenianweekly/>\n\nAs of 2015, Turkish textbooks still describe the Armenians as \"traitors\", call the Armenian Genocide a lie and say that the Ottoman Turks \"took necessary measures to counter Armenian separatism.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/world/europe/turkeys-century-of-denial-about-an-armenian-genocide.html A Century After Armenian Genocide, Turkey's Denial Only Deepens], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> Armenians are also characterized as \"dishonorable and treacherous,\" and students are taught that Armenians were forcibly relocated to protect Turkish citizens from attacks.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/04/23/turkey-armenia-genocide-massacre-anniversary/26261059/ Turkey, Armenians battle over genocide 100 years later], ''[[USA Today]]''</ref>\n\n===French law recognizing colonialism's positive value===\n{{Main|French law on colonialism}}\nOn 23 February 2005, the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union for a Popular Movement (UMP)]] conservative majority at the [[French National Assembly]] voted a law compelling history textbooks and teachers to \"acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa\".<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000444898&fastPos=2&fastReqId=1461448112&categorieLien=id&oldAction=rechTexte]</ref> Criticized by historians and teachers, among them [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]], who refused to recognize the French Parliament's right to influence the way history is written (despite the French [[Holocaust denial]] laws, see ''[[Loi Gayssot]]'').

Debate continues about such subjects as, for example, the extent and nature of ordinary Germans' involvement in and knowledge of the policy of genocide, and the timing of orders given for the extermination of the Jews. However, the valid endeavour of historical revisionism, which involves the re-interpretation of historical knowledge in the light of newly emerging evidence, is a very different task from that of claiming that the essential facts of the Holocaust, and the evidence for those facts, are fabrications.\" [http://www.jpr.org.uk/Reports/CS_Reports/no_3_2000/index.htm The nature of Holocaust denial: What is Holocaust denial?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312050016/http://www.jpr.org.uk/Reports/CS_Reports/no_3_2000/index.htm |date=12 March 2012 }}, JPR report No. 3, 2000.

Those in the know, indeed, are accustomed to avoid the term altogether when referring to him and use some circumlocution such as 'historical writer' instead. Irving is essentially an ideologue who uses history for his own political purposes; he is not primarily concerned with discovering and interpreting what happened in the past, he is concerned merely to give a selective and tendentious account of it in order to further his own ideological ends in the present. The true historian's primary concern, however, is with the past.

Critics said that the book was \"marred by his sympathies for its ethnic Albanian separatists, anti-Serbian bias, and illusions about the Balkans\".{{sfn|Djilas|1998}} In late 1999, Thomas Emmert of the history faculty of [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] in [[Minnesota]] reviewed the book in ''Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans Online'' and while praising aspects of the book also asserted that it was \"shaped by the author's overriding determination to challenge Serbian myths\", that Malcolm was \"partisan\", and also complained that the book made a \"transparent attempt to prove that the main Serbian myths are false\".{{sfn|Emmert|1999}} In 2006, a study by Frederick Anscombe looked at issues surrounding scholarship on Kosovo such as Noel Malcolm's work ''Kosovo: A Short History''.<ref name=\"Anscombe770\"/> Anscombe noted that Malcolm offered a \"a detailed critique of the competing versions of Kosovo's history\" and that his work marked a \"remarkable reversal\" of previous acceptance by Western historians of the \"Serbian account\" regarding the migration of the Serbs (1690) from Kosovo.<ref name=\"Anscombe770\">{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|p=770}}. \"Noel Malcolm, who offers a detailed critique of the competing versions of Kosovo's history...

The conservative [[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]] commissioned the ''Atarashii Rekishi Ky\u014dkasho'' textbook with the purpose of traditional national and international view of that Japanese historical period. The Ministry of Education vets all history textbooks, and those that do not mention Japanese war crimes and atrocities are not vetted;{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} however, the ''Atarashii Rekishi Ky\u014dkasho'' de-emphasizes aggressive Japanese Imperial wartime behaviour and the matter of Chinese and Korean [[comfort women]].

Section and the authoritarian dictatorships in South Korea during 1960s\u20131980s.The Ministry of Education announced that it would put the secondary-school history textbook under state control; \"This was an inevitable choice in order to straighten out historical errors and end the social dispute caused by ideological bias in the textbooks,\" Hwang Woo-yea, education minister said on 12 October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20151012000678|title=Ministry unveils plan for history textbook publication system|first=The Korea|last=Herald|date=12 October 2015|accessdate=17 October 2016}}</ref> According to the government's plan, the current history textbooks of South Korea will be replaced by a single textbook written by a panel of government-appointed historians and the new series of publications would be issued under the title ''The Correct Textbook of History'' and are to be issued to the public and private primary and secondary schools in 2017 onwards.\n\nThe move has sparked fierce criticism from academics who argue the system can be used to distort the history and glorify the history of those who served the Imperial Japanese government ([[Chinilpa]]) and of the authoritarian dictatorships. Moreover, 466 organizations including Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union formed History Act Network in solidarity and have staged protests: \"The government's decision allows the state too much control and power and, therefore, it is against political neutrality that is certainly the fundamental principle of education.\" Many South Korean historians condemned [[Kyohaksa]] for their text glorifying those who served the Imperial Japanese government (Chinilpa) and the authoritarian dictatorship with a far-right political perspective. On the other hand, New Right supporters welcomed the textbook saying that 'the new textbook finally describes historical truths contrary to the history textbooks published by left-wing publishers,' and the textbook issue became intensified as a case of ideological conflict.\n\nIn fact, there once was a time in Korean history that the history textbook was put under state control. It was during the authoritarian regime under [[Park Chung-hee]] (1963&ndash;1979), who is a father of Park Geun-hye, former President of South Korea, and was used as a means to keep the [[Fourth Republic of Korea|Yushin Regime]] (also known as Yushin Dictatorship). However, there had been continuous criticisms about the system especially from the 1980s when Korea experienced a dramatic democratic development. In 2003, liberalization of textbook began when the textbooks on Korean modern and contemporary history were published though the Textbook Screening System, which allows textbooks to be published not by a single government body but by many different companies, for the first time.\n\n====Turkey====\n[[Education in Turkey]] is centralized: its policy, administration and content are each determined by the Turkish government. Textbooks taught in schools are either prepared directly by the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education (MEB)]] or must be approved by its Instruction and Education Board. In practice, this means that the Turkish government is directly responsible for what textbooks are taught in schools across Turkey.<ref name=armenianweekly>[http://armenianweekly.com/2014/12/04/textbooks/ Akcam: Textbooks and the Armenian Genocide in Turkey: Heading Towards 2015], ''[[Armenian Weekly]]''</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Taner Ak\u00e7am]], writing for the ''[[Armenian Weekly]]'', discussed 2014\u20132015 Turkish elementary and middle school textbooks that the MEB had made available on the internet. He found that Turkish history textbooks are filled with the message that Armenians are people \"who are incited by foreigners, who aim to break apart the state and the country, and who murdered Turks and Muslims.\" The Armenian Genocide is referred to as the \"Armenian matter\", and is described as a lie perpetrated in order to further the perceived hidden agenda of Armenians. Recognition of the Armenian Genocide is defined as the \"biggest threat to Turkish national security\".<ref name=armenianweekly/>\n\nAk\u00e7am summarized one textbook that claims the Armenians had sided with the Russians during the war. The 1909 [[Adana massacre]], in which as many as 20,000\u201330,000 Armenians were massacred, is identified as \"The Rebellion of Armenians of Adana\". According to the book, the Armenian [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party|Hnchak]] and [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnak]] organizations instituted rebellions in many parts of [[Anatolia]], and \"didn't hesitate to kill Armenians who would not join them,\" issuing instructions that \"if you want to survive you have to kill your neighbor first.\" Claims highlighted by Ak\u00e7am:<ref name=armenianweekly/> <BLOCKQUOTE>[The Armenians murdered] many people living in villages, even children, by attacking Turkish villages, which had become defenseless because all the Turkish men were fighting on the war fronts. ... They stabbed the Ottoman forces in the back. They created obstacles for the operations of the Ottoman units by cutting off their supply routes and destroying bridges and roads. ... They spied for Russia and by rebelling in the cities where they were located, they eased the way for the Russian invasion. ... Since the Armenians who engaged in massacres in collaboration with the Russians created a dangerous situation, this law required the migration of [Armenian people] from the towns they were living in to Syria, a safe Ottoman territory. ... Despite being in the midst of war, the Ottoman state took precautions and measures when it came to the Armenians who were migrating. Their tax payments were postponed, they were permitted to take any personal property they wished, government officials were assigned to ensure that they were protected from attacks during the journey and that their needs were met, police stations were established to ensure that their lives and properties were secure.</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\nSimilar revisionist claims found in other textbooks by Ak\u00e7am included that Armenian \"back-stabbing\" was the reason the Ottomans lost the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]] (similar to the post-War German [[stab-in-the-back myth]]), that the [[Hamidian massacres]] never happened, that the Armenians were armed by the Russians during late [[World War I]] to fight the Ottomans (in reality they had already been nearly annihilated from the area by this point), that Armenians killed 600,000 Turks during said war, that the deportation were to save Armenians from other violent Armenian gangs, and that Armenians who were deported were later able to return to Turkey unscathed and reclaim their properties.<ref name=armenianweekly/>\n\nAs of 2015, Turkish textbooks still describe the Armenians as \"traitors\", call the Armenian Genocide a lie and say that the Ottoman Turks \"took necessary measures to counter Armenian separatism.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/world/europe/turkeys-century-of-denial-about-an-armenian-genocide.html A Century After Armenian Genocide, Turkey's Denial Only Deepens], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> Armenians are also characterized as \"dishonorable and treacherous,\" and students are taught that Armenians were forcibly relocated to protect Turkish citizens from attacks.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/04/23/turkey-armenia-genocide-massacre-anniversary/26261059/ Turkey, Armenians battle over genocide 100 years later], ''[[USA Today]]''</ref>\n\n===French law recognizing colonialism's positive value===\n{{Main|French law on colonialism}}\nOn 23 February 2005, the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union for a Popular Movement (UMP)]] conservative majority at the [[French National Assembly]] voted a law compelling history textbooks and teachers to \"acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa\".<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000444898&fastPos=2&fastReqId=1461448112&categorieLien=id&oldAction=rechTexte]</ref> Criticized by historians and teachers, among them [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]], who refused to recognize the French Parliament's right to influence the way history is written (despite the French [[Holocaust denial]] laws, see ''[[Loi Gayssot]]'').

''[[Collegiate Baseball Newspaper|Collegiate Baseball]]'' ranked Bakich's first recruiting class the 24th best in the nation. In 2004, Vanderbilt increased its batting average from .258 the previous season to .304, the largest jump in school history.<ref name=vbio/> Vanderbilt brought in the No. 1 ranked recruiting class in 2005.

Nesbit]].\n\n== Plot ==\nRosalind and Robbie are staying with their father, David, his wife, Alice, and their half sister, Maudie whilst their mother is on an [[Open University]] course. Also staying with David and Alice is Alice's daughter Smash (Samantha), whose father is on a honeymoon in the [[Seychelles]].\n\nIn an attempt to bring the family closer together David takes them on a picnic to [[Oxshott Heath and Woods|Oxshott Woods]]. Smash and Rosalind climb trees as part of a dare, however, Robbie struggles to climb the tree much to Smash\u2019s amusement. Whilst there the children explore the sandpit and when digging they discover the Psammead which Rosalind recognises from her book ''[[Five Children and It]]''. Robbie wishes to be good at climbing trees. The Psammead grants the wish and David takes an interest, claiming that Robbie would be an amazing gymnast. Not realising that the wishes only lasted until sunset Robbie continues to show off his skills. David phones his friend, Tim, who is a P.E. teacher and runs summer classes. The next day David, Rosalind, Robbie and Smash go to the gym where Tim works. Robbie struggles and embarrasses himself and David. However, Tim takes an interest in Smash.\n\nThe next day, the children beg to go back to [[Oxshott Heath and Woods|Oxshott Woods]]. Smash wishes to be rich and famous and soon after they are taken away by their bodyguard, Bulldog, and meet their PA, Naomi. They travel into London and have a trip around Harrods. Rosalind is a famous writer and attends a book signing. Robbie has his own cookery show, Maudie, a star of \"The Doodle Family\" as Polly Doodle appears on the Start-At-Six-Show. Smash is a famous singer and in the middle of her concert in the [[O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] when the wish ends, and the children are left alone. They venture through London guided by Smash, and when they return they get banned from going to Oxshott Woods.\n\nThe next day the children (excluding Maudie) are grounded, and in an attempt to reconcile the three of them write letters apologising. Smash returns to her contemptuous attitude towards Rosalind and Robbie and calls Rosalind's letter \"loathsome grovelling\". After Smash prompts Maudie she manages to convince Alice and David to return to Oxshott Woods. In anger Smash wishes (accidentally) that David never met Alice, and David and Maudie start to disappear. The Psammead undoes the wish and Rosalind wishes that part of the wish that Alice and David never see anything magical but her main wish is to meet the children from ''[[Five Children and It]]''.\n\nThe children meet Cyril, Anthea, Jane and Robert. They invite Rosalind, Robbie, Smash and Maudie to play in their nursery. The five children decide that their wish will be to go visit the future. Rosalind accidentally wishes that she could live in the Edwardian Era forever. In reality she gets arrested and is sent to a workhouse. Smash wishes Rosalind back after she doesn't return at sunset. The following day David and Alice take the children to go see Smash's favourite author Marvel O'Kaye.\n\nThe day after they go to Oxshott Woods in the afternoon after it started raining. Maudie wishes that the people from the various nursery rhymes, the characters of [[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack and Jill]]; [[Polly Put the Kettle On|Polly and Sukey]]; [[Ring Around the Rosie]] and [[Hey Diddle Diddle|the Cat, the Cow, the Dog, the Dish and the Spoon]] would come to life, but they continue to ignore the children until sunset. With Robbie's second wish he wishes that his toy animals came alive. Smash's second wish is that they can fly, so the children grow wings and they enjoy flying around until it rains. Rosalind chooses the final wish before they go home and she wishes for their heart's desire.<ref>One's heart's desire is that single thing, person, place, event or process, for which a person has the deepest feelings, longings and passion, feelings that arise from the depth of one's being, feelings that are not capable of analysis.</ref> When they return home David comes back with some things; a hamster for Robbie, a gymnastics leotard for Smash, a notebook for Rosalind, and Maudie receives a story book with all the characters she wished for. The children realise that their presents were their heart's desire: Robbie a pet; Smash to receive attention and Rosalind to keep writing stories. Maudie says that she wanted to see the Psammead again.

Nesbit]].\n\n== Plot ==\nRosalind and Robbie are staying with their father, David, his wife, Alice, and their half sister, Maudie whilst their mother is on an [[Open University]] course. Also staying with David and Alice is Alice's daughter Smash (Samantha), whose father is on a honeymoon in the [[Seychelles]].\n\nIn an attempt to bring the family closer together David takes them on a picnic to [[Oxshott Heath and Woods|Oxshott Woods]]. Smash and Rosalind climb trees as part of a dare, however, Robbie struggles to climb the tree much to Smash\u2019s amusement. Whilst there the children explore the sandpit and when digging they discover the Psammead which Rosalind recognises from her book ''[[Five Children and It]]''. Robbie wishes to be good at climbing trees. The Psammead grants the wish and David takes an interest, claiming that Robbie would be an amazing gymnast. Not realising that the wishes only lasted until sunset Robbie continues to show off his skills. David phones his friend, Tim, who is a P.E. teacher and runs summer classes. The next day David, Rosalind, Robbie and Smash go to the gym where Tim works. Robbie struggles and embarrasses himself and David. However, Tim takes an interest in Smash.\n\nThe next day, the children beg to go back to [[Oxshott Heath and Woods|Oxshott Woods]]. Smash wishes to be rich and famous and soon after they are taken away by their bodyguard, Bulldog, and meet their PA, Naomi. They travel into London and have a trip around Harrods. Rosalind is a famous writer and attends a book signing. Robbie has his own cookery show, Maudie, a star of \"The Doodle Family\" as Polly Doodle appears on the Start-At-Six-Show. Smash is a famous singer and in the middle of her concert in the [[O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] when the wish ends, and the children are left alone. They venture through London guided by Smash, and when they return they get banned from going to Oxshott Woods.\n\nThe next day the children (excluding Maudie) are grounded, and in an attempt to reconcile the three of them write letters apologising. Smash returns to her contemptuous attitude towards Rosalind and Robbie and calls Rosalind's letter \"loathsome grovelling\". After Smash prompts Maudie she manages to convince Alice and David to return to Oxshott Woods. In anger Smash wishes (accidentally) that David never met Alice, and David and Maudie start to disappear. The Psammead undoes the wish and Rosalind wishes that part of the wish that Alice and David never see anything magical but her main wish is to meet the children from ''[[Five Children and It]]''.\n\nThe children meet Cyril, Anthea, Jane and Robert. They invite Rosalind, Robbie, Smash and Maudie to play in their nursery. The five children decide that their wish will be to go visit the future. Rosalind accidentally wishes that she could live in the Edwardian Era forever. In reality she gets arrested and is sent to a workhouse. Smash wishes Rosalind back after she doesn't return at sunset. The following day David and Alice take the children to go see Smash's favourite author Marvel O'Kaye.\n\nThe day after they go to Oxshott Woods in the afternoon after it started raining. Maudie wishes that the people from the various nursery rhymes, the characters of [[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack and Jill]]; [[Polly Put the Kettle On|Polly and Sukey]]; [[Ring Around the Rosie]] and [[Hey Diddle Diddle|the Cat, the Cow, the Dog, the Dish and the Spoon]] would come to life, but they continue to ignore the children until sunset. With Robbie's second wish he wishes that his toy animals came alive. Smash's second wish is that they can fly, so the children grow wings and they enjoy flying around until it rains. Rosalind chooses the final wish before they go home and she wishes for their heart's desire.<ref>One's heart's desire is that single thing, person, place, event or process, for which a person has the deepest feelings, longings and passion, feelings that arise from the depth of one's being, feelings that are not capable of analysis.</ref> When they return home David comes back with some things; a hamster for Robbie, a gymnastics leotard for Smash, a notebook for Rosalind, and Maudie receives a story book with all the characters she wished for. The children realise that their presents were their heart's desire: Robbie a pet; Smash to receive attention and Rosalind to keep writing stories. Maudie says that she wanted to see the Psammead again. Rosalind begins writing the story of their holidays together.\n\n== Characters ==\n*'''Rosalind Hartlepool''': The narrator and likes reading classic novels.

Further, on 20 July 2006 the U.S. Congress approved the [[US-Oman Free Trade Agreement]]. This took effect on 1 January 2009, eliminating tariff barriers on all consumer and industrial products.  It also provides strong protections for foreign businesses investing in Oman.<ref>[[Chemical & Engineering News]], 5 January 2009, \"U.S.-Oman pact expands Free Trade\", p. 18</ref>\n\nThe government also undertook some important policy measures during 2018 with the establishment of a commercial arbitration center, the adoption of a new commercial companies\u2019 law, and a further streamlining of licensing processes through Invest Easy in order to improve the business and investment climate and promote private sector-led growth in the Sultanate.\n\n[[Oman]]'s economy and revenues from petroleum products have enabled Oman's dramatic development over the past 50 years.

[[Petroleum Development Oman]] (PDO) began production in August 1967. The Omani Government owns 60% of PDO, and foreign interests own 40% ([[Royal Dutch Shell]] owns 34%; the remaining 6% is owned by [[Compagnie Francaise des Petroles]] [Total] and [[Partex]]). In 1976, Oman's oil production rose to 366,000 barrels (58,000 m\u00b3) per day but declined gradually to about 285,000 barrels (45,000 m\u00b3) per day in late 1980 due to the depletion of recoverable reserves. From 1981 to 1986, Oman compensated for [[1980s oil glut|declining oil prices]], by increasing production levels to 600,000 b/d. With the collapse of oil prices in 1986, however, revenues dropped dramatically. Production was cut back temporarily in coordination with the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC), and production levels again reached 600,000 b/d by mid-1987, which helped increase revenues. By mid-2000, production had climbed to more than 900,000 b/d where they remain. [[Natural gas]] reserves, which increasingly provide the fuel for power generation and desalination, stand at 18 trillion ft\u00b3 (510&nbsp;km\u00b3).

These are agriculture and fisheries, manufacturing, logistics and transport, energy and mining, and tourism.\n\nAccording to the [[Central Bank of Oman]]'s [https://cbo.gov.om/sites/assets/Documents/English/Publications/AnnualReports/AnnualReport2018Eng.pdf Annual Report 2018], the Omani crude oil price averaged at US$69.7 a barrel in 2018 as compared to US$51.3 per barrel during 2017. The recovery in oil prices also contributed to growth in non-oil economic activities, reflecting inter-linkages, although the dependency of non-oil activities on oil activities has somewhat weakened in the last few years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cbo.gov.om/report/AnnualReport/89|title=Central Bank of Oman Annual Economic Report 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Central Bank of Oman|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[World Bank]] growth is expected to increase over 2020\u201321, driven in part by a large increase in gas production from the new Khazzan gas project, and infrastructure spending plans in both oil and non-oil sectors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/523771570664044067/EN-MPO-OCT19-Oman.pdf|title=World Bank Oman Economic Outlook October 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Notably, with [[Khazzan-Makarem gas field|Khazzan]] phase-I becoming operational, the natural gas under the petroleum sector is also emerging as a significant contributor to the Omani economy, with [[BP]] committing to invest US$16 Billion developing the field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofoman.com/article/891196/Oman/BP-Oman-to-invest-16bn-for-developing--Khazzan-Gas-Project|title=BP Oman to invest $16bn for developing Khazzan Gas Project|date=2019-02-25|website=Times of Oman|language=English|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Special Economic Zone Authority of Duqm (SEZAD) attracted $14.2 billion worth of investments in the form of usufruct agreements signed till the end of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omanobserver.om/duqm-zone-attracts-14-2bn-investments/|title=Duqm zone attracts $14.2bn investments|last=Observer|first=Oman|date=2019-07-23|website=Oman Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> With a land area of 2,000 km2 and 70&nbsp;km. of coastline along the Arabian Sea, the Duqm Special Economic Zone is the largest in the Middle East and North Africa region and ranks among the largest in the world.

The goal of this initiative is to provide jobs for the rapidly growing Omani population. The state has allotted subsidies for companies to hire local employees not only to gradually reduce reliance on foreign workers but also to overcome an overwhelming employment preference on the part of Omanis for government jobs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Middle East Contemporary Survey, Volume Xv: 1991|last=Ayalon|first=Ami|publisher=Westview Press|year=1993|isbn=0813318696|location=Boulder|pages=602\u2013603}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1999, the number of Omanis in government services exceeded the set target of 72%, and in most departments reached 86% of employees. The Ministry has also stipulated fixed Omanisation targets in six areas of the private sector. Most companies have registered Omanisation plans. Since April 1998 a 'green card' has been awarded to companies that meet their Omanisation targets and comply with the eligibility criteria for labour relations. The names of these companies are published in the local press and they receive preferential treatment in their dealings with the Ministry. \nAcademics working on various aspects of Omanisation include Ingo Forstenlechner from United Arab Emirates University and Paul Knoglinger from the FHWien.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nOmanisation, however, in the private sector is not always successful. One of the reasons is that jobs are still filled by expatriates because of the lower wages. Studies reveal that an increasing number of the job openings in the private sector pay the official minimum salary for nationals, which is an unattractive employment prospect for the locals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Middle East Contemporary Survey, Volume Xv: 1991|last=Schlumberger|first=Oliver|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780804757768|location=Stanford, CA|pages=157}}</ref> There is also the problem of placing Omani workers in senior positions due to the fact that a significant chunk of the workforce is composed of young and inexperienced workers.<ref>Ayalon, p. 603.</ref>\n\n===Training and Omanisation===\nIn order to meet the training and Omanisation requirements of the banking sector, the Omani Institute of Bankers was established in 1983 and has since played a leading role in increasing the number of Omanis working in the sector. The Central Bank monitors the progress made by the commercial banks with Omanisation and in July 1995 issued a circular stipulating that by the year 2000, at least 75% of senior and middle management positions should be held by Omanis. In the clerical grades 95% of staff should be Omanised and 100% in all other grades. At the end of 1999, no less than 98.8% of all positions were held by Omanis. Women made up 60% of the total. During 2001 the percentage of Omanis employed at senior and middle management levels went up from 76.7% to 78.8%. There was a slight increase in the clerical grade percentage to 98.7%, while the non-clerical grades had already reached 100% Omanisation in 1998. The banking sector currently employs 2,113 senior and middle managers supported by 4,757 other staff. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe Ministry has issued a decision regulating tourist guides, who in future will be required to have a license. This Ministerial decision aims at encouraging professionalism in the industry as well as providing career opportunities for Omanis who will be encouraged to learn foreign languages so as to replace foreign tour guides. In January 1996, a major step forward in the training of Omanis in the hotel industry came with the opening of the National Hospitality Institute (NHI). The Institute is a public company quoted on the Omani Stock exchange. In February 1997, the first batch of 55 male and female trainees, sponsored by the Vocational Training Authority, were awarded their first level certificates and were given on-the-job training in several hotels. In May 1999, the fourth batch of 95 trainees obtained their NVQs, bringing the number of Omanis trained by the Institute to around 450. Omanis now make up 37% of the 34,549 employees in the hotel and catering business, which exceeds the Omanisation target of 30% set by the Government. The NHI has also trained catering staff from the Sultan's Armed Forces and has launched a two-year tour guide course, which includes language training, safe driving, first aid and a knowledge of local history and geography.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Investment==\nThe stock [[market capitalization|market capitalisation]] of listed companies in Oman was valued at $15,269 million in 2005

[[Petroleum Development Oman]] (PDO) began production in August 1967. The Omani Government owns 60% of PDO, and foreign interests own 40% ([[Royal Dutch Shell]] owns 34%; the remaining 6% is owned by [[Compagnie Francaise des Petroles]] [Total] and [[Partex]]). In 1976, Oman's oil production rose to 366,000 barrels (58,000 m\u00b3) per day but declined gradually to about 285,000 barrels (45,000 m\u00b3) per day in late 1980 due to the depletion of recoverable reserves. From 1981 to 1986, Oman compensated for [[1980s oil glut|declining oil prices]], by increasing production levels to 600,000 b/d. With the collapse of oil prices in 1986, however, revenues dropped dramatically. Production was cut back temporarily in coordination with the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC), and production levels again reached 600,000 b/d by mid-1987, which helped increase revenues. By mid-2000, production had climbed to more than 900,000 b/d where they remain. [[Natural gas]] reserves, which increasingly provide the fuel for power generation and desalination, stand at 18 trillion ft\u00b3 (510&nbsp;km\u00b3). The [[Oman LNG]] processing plant located in Sur was opened in 2000, with production capacity of 6.6 million tons/YR, as well as unsubstantial gas liquids, including condensates.\n\nOman\u2019s 10th five-year plan (2020-2025) is the first implementation plan of [https://www.2040.om/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2040_En.pdf Vision 2040], and will focus its efforts towards achieving economic diversification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofoman.com/article/2388537/Oman/Omans-next-5-year-plan-to-focus-on-Tanfeedh-goals|title=Oman's next 5-year plan to focus on Tanfeedh goals|date=2019-12-14|website=Times of Oman|language=English|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> The plan for economic diversification aims to move Oman away from the oil-and-gas-based sources of income, and has earmarked five sectors that have high growth potential and economic returns. These are agriculture and fisheries, manufacturing, logistics and transport, energy and mining, and tourism. \n\nAccording to the [[Central Bank of Oman]]'s [https://cbo.gov.om/sites/assets/Documents/English/Publications/AnnualReports/AnnualReport2018Eng.pdf Annual Report 2018], the Omani crude oil price averaged at US$ 69.7 a barrel in 2018 as compared to US$ 51.3 per barrel during 2017. The recovery in oil prices also contributed to growth in non-oil economic activities, reflecting inter-linkages, although the dependency of non-oil activities on oil activities has somewhat weakened in the last few years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cbo.gov.om/report/AnnualReport/89|title=Central Bank of Oman Annual Economic Report 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Central Bank of Oman|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nAccording to the [[World Bank]] growth is expected to increase over 2020-21, driven in part by a large increase in gas production from the new Khazzan gas project, and infrastructure spending plans in both oil and non-oil sectors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/523771570664044067/EN-MPO-OCT19-Oman.pdf|title=World Bank Oman Economic Outlook October 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Notably, with [[Khazzan-Makarem gas field|Khazzan]] phase-I becoming operational, the natural gas under the petroleum sector is also emerging as a significant contributor to the Omani economy, with [[BP]] commiting to invest US$16 Billion developing the field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofoman.com/article/891196/Oman/BP-Oman-to-invest-16bn-for-developing--Khazzan-Gas-Project|title=BP Oman to invest $16bn for developing Khazzan Gas Project|date=2019-02-25|website=Times of Oman|language=English|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> Meanwhile the Special Economic Zone Authority of Duqm (SEZAD) attracted $14.2 billion worth of investments in the form of usufruct agreements signed till the end of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omanobserver.om/duqm-zone-attracts-14-2bn-investments/|title=Duqm zone attracts $14.2bn investments|last=Observer|first=Oman|date=2019-07-23|website=Oman Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> With a land area of 2,000 km2 and 70 km. of coastline along the Arabian Sea, the Duqm Special Economic Zone is the largest in the Middle East and North Africa region and ranks among the largest in the world.

The goal of this initiative is to provide jobs for the rapidly growing Omani population. The state has allotted subsidies for companies to hire local employees not only to gradually reduce reliance on foreign workers but also to overcome an overwhelming employment preference on the part of Omanis for government jobs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Middle East Contemporary Survey, Volume Xv: 1991|last=Ayalon|first=Ami|publisher=Westview Press|year=1993|isbn=0813318696|location=Boulder|pages=602\u2013603}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1999, the number of Omanis in government services exceeded the set target of 72%, and in most departments reached 86% of employees. The Ministry has also stipulated fixed Omanisation targets in six areas of the private sector. Most companies have registered Omanisation plans. Since April 1998 a 'green card' has been awarded to companies that meet their Omanisation targets and comply with the eligibility criteria for labour relations. The names of these companies are published in the local press and they receive preferential treatment in their dealings with the Ministry. \nAcademics working on various aspects of Omanisation include Ingo Forstenlechner from United Arab Emirates University and Paul Knoglinger from the FHWien.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nOmanisation, however, in the private sector is not always successful. One of the reasons is that jobs are still filled by expatriates because of the lower wages. Studies reveal that an increasing number of the job openings in the private sector pay the official minimum salary for nationals, which is an unattractive employment prospect for the locals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Middle East Contemporary Survey, Volume Xv: 1991|last=Schlumberger|first=Oliver|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780804757768|location=Stanford, CA|pages=157}}</ref> There is also the problem of placing Omani workers in senior positions due to the fact that a significant chunk of the workforce is composed of young and inexperienced workers.<ref>Ayalon, p. 603.</ref>\n\n===Training and Omanisation===\nIn order to meet the training and Omanisation requirements of the banking sector, the Omani Institute of Bankers was established in 1983 and has since played a leading role in increasing the number of Omanis working in the sector. The Central Bank monitors the progress made by the commercial banks with Omanisation and in July 1995 issued a circular stipulating that by the year 2000, at least 75% of senior and middle management positions should be held by Omanis. In the clerical grades 95% of staff should be Omanised and 100% in all other grades. At the end of 1999, no less than 98.8% of all positions were held by Omanis. Women made up 60% of the total. During 2001 the percentage of Omanis employed at senior and middle management levels went up from 76.7% to 78.8%. There was a slight increase in the clerical grade percentage to 98.7%, while the non-clerical grades had already reached 100% Omanisation in 1998. The banking sector currently employs 2,113 senior and middle managers supported by 4,757 other staff. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe Ministry has issued a decision regulating tourist guides, who in future will be required to have a license. This Ministerial decision aims at encouraging professionalism in the industry as well as providing career opportunities for Omanis who will be encouraged to learn foreign languages so as to replace foreign tour guides. In January 1996, a major step forward in the training of Omanis in the hotel industry came with the opening of the National Hospitality Institute (NHI). The Institute is a public company quoted on the Omani Stock exchange. In February 1997, the first batch of 55 male and female trainees, sponsored by the Vocational Training Authority, were awarded their first level certificates and were given on-the-job training in several hotels. In May 1999, the fourth batch of 95 trainees obtained their NVQs, bringing the number of Omanis trained by the Institute to around 450. Omanis now make up 37% of the 34,549 employees in the hotel and catering business, which exceeds the Omanisation target of 30% set by the Government. The NHI has also trained catering staff from the Sultan's Armed Forces and has launched a two-year tour guide course, which includes language training, safe driving, first aid and a knowledge of local history and geography.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Investment==\nThe stock [[market capitalization|market capitalisation]] of listed companies in Oman was valued at $15,269 million in 2005 by the [[World Bank]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20061205235151/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A20394793~menuPK%3A1192714~pagePK%3A64133150~piPK%3A64133175~theSitePK%3A239419%2C00.html]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Oman}}\n*[[Central Bank of Oman]]\n*[[Omani Rial]]\n*[[List of companies of Oman]]\n*[[US-Oman Free Trade Agreement]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20071025224733/http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/fs/oman.pdf\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|Oman}}\n\n===Government===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n*[http://www.omanet.om Ministry of Information]\n*[http://www.mofa.gov.om Ministry of Foreign Affairs]\n*[http://www.omantourism.gov.om Ministry of Tourism]\n*[http://www.moneoman.gov.om Ministry of National Economy]\n*[http://www.mocioman.gov.om Ministry of Commerce & Industry]\n*[http://www.cbo-oman.org Central Bank of Oman]\n*[http://www.chamberoman.com Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry]\n*[http://www.ociped.com Omani Centre for Investment Promotion]\n*[http://www.msm.gov.om Muscat Securities Market]\n*[http://www.peie.om Public Establishment for Industrial Estates]\n*[[Al-Mazyunah Free Zone]]\n*[http://www.mof.gov.om Ministry of Finance]\n*[http://www.sgrf.gov.om State General Reserve Fund]\n*[http://www.tenderboard.gov.om Oman Tender Board]\n*[http://www.sai.gov.om State Audit Institute]\n*[http://www.ocodubai.com Oman Commercial Office in Dubai]\n*[http://www.manpower.gov.om Ministry of Manpower]\n*[http://www.mog.gov.om Ministry of Oil & Gas]\n*[http://www.mocs.gov.om Ministry of Civil Service]\n}}\n\n===Other===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n*[http://www.bankmuscat.com Bank Muscat]\n*[http://www.oiboman.com Oman International Bank]\n*[http://www.nbo.co.om National Bank of Oman]\n*[http://www.bankdhofar.com Bank Dhofar]\n*[http://www.omanab.com Oman Arab Bank]\n*[http://www.banksohar.net Bank Sohar]\n*[http://www.oman.hsbc.com HSBC Oman]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012022603/http://www.salalahport.com/ Salalah Port]\n*[http://www.portofsohar.com Sohar Port]\n*[http://www.oeronline.com Oman Economic Review]\n*http://www.zawya.com/countries/om/\n*http://www.ameinfo.com/\n*[http://www.oilandgasinfrastructure.com/home/oilandgasmiddleeast/oman Map of the oil and gas infrastructure in Oman]\n*{{curlie|Regional/Middle_East/Oman/Business_and_Economy/Economic_Development|Oman Economic Development}}\n}}\n\n{{World Trade Organization}}\n{{Asia in topic|Economy of}}\n{{Asia in topic|Petroleum industry in}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economy Of Oman}}\n[[Category:World Trade Organization member economies|Oman]]\n[[Category:Economy of Oman| ]]\n[[Category:Economy of the Arab League]]\n", "name_user": "Nat965", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOverview:ApplyGen fix(es),typo(s) fixed: Meanwhile \u2192 Meanwhile,, commiting \u2192 committing, \u2019s \u2192 's, 2020-21 \u2192 2020\u201321", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Oman"}
