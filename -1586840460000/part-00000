It was mostly developed in the 17th century and commonly used for entertainment purposes. It was increasingly used for education during the 19th century. Since the late 19th century, smaller versions were also mass-produced as a toy. The magic lantern was in wide use from the 18th century until the mid-20th century, when it was superseded by a compact version that could hold many 35&nbsp;mm photographic slides: the [[slide projector]].\n\n==Technology==\n\n===Apparatus===\n[[File:1721? Jacob 's Gravesande - Physices Elementa Mathematica.jpg|thumb|A page of [[Willem 's Gravesande]]'s 1720 book ''Physices Elementa Mathematica'' with Jan van Musschenbroek's magic lantern projecting a monster. The depicted lantern is one of the oldest known preserved examples, and is in the collection of [[Museum Boerhaave]], Leiden]]\nThe magic lantern used a concave mirror in back of a light source to direct the light through a small rectangular sheet of glass\u2014a \"lantern slide\" that bore the image\u2014and onward into a lens at the front of the apparatus. The lens adjusted to focus the plane of the slide at the distance of the projection screen, which could be simply a white wall, and it therefore formed an enlarged image of the slide on the screen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pfragner, Julius. \"An Optician Looks for Work\". The Motion Picture: From Magic Lantern to Sound. Great Britain: Bailey Brothers and Swinfen Ltd. 9-21. Print.</ref> Some lanterns, including those of [[Christiaan Huygens]] and Jan van Musschenbroek, used 3 lenses for the [[objective (optics)|objective]].\n\nBiunial lanterns, with two objectives, became common during the 19th century and enabled a smooth and easy change of pictures. [[Stereopticon]]s added more powerful light sources to optimize the projection of photographic slides.\n\n===Slides===\nOriginally the pictures were hand painted on glass slides. Initially, figures were rendered with black paint but soon transparent colors were also used. Sometimes the painting was done on oiled paper. Usually black paint was used as a background to block superfluous light, so the figures could be projected without distracting borders or frames. Many slides were finished with a layer of transparent lacquer, but in a later period cover glasses were also used to protect the painted layer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen1_uk.htm|title=All about lantern slides (1)|publisher=}}</ref> Most handmade slides were mounted in wood frames with a round or square opening for the picture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen2_uk.htm|title=All about magic lantern slides (2)|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:10 Story about a boy falling in a barrel of honey.JPG|thumb|left|A paper rimmed mass-produced slide.]]\nAfter 1820 the manufacturing of hand colored printed slides started, often making use of [[decalcomania]] transfers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen1_uk.htm#decal|title=All about lantern slides (1)|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref> Many manufactured slides were produced on strips of glass with several pictures on them and rimmed with a strip of glued paper.\n\nThe first photographic lantern slides, called ''hyalotypes'', were invented by the German-born brothers Ernst Wilhelm (William) and [[Frederick Langenheim|Friedrich (Frederick) Langenheim]] in 1848 in [[Philadelphia]] and patented in 1850.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US7784A/en|title=Improvement in photographic pictures on glass}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/23363210/Glass_Transparencies_Marketing_Photographys_Luminosity_and_Precision_2016_|title=Glass Transparencies: Marketing Photography\u2019s Luminosity and Precision|last=[[Kim Timby|Timby]]|first=[[Kim Timby|Kim]]|year=2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historiccamera.com/cgi-bin/librarium2/pm.cgi?action=app_display&app=datasheet&app_id=1799&|title=William and Frederick Langenheim at Historic Camera|website=historiccamera.com}}</ref>\n\n===Light sources===\nApart from sunlight, the only light sources available at the time of invention in the 17th century were candles and oil lamps, which were very inefficient and produced very dim projected images. The invention of the [[Argand lamp]] in the 1790s helped to make the images brighter. The invention of [[limelight]] in the 1820s made them very much brighter. The invention of the intensely bright electric [[arc lamp]] in the 1860s eliminated the need for combustible gases or hazardous chemicals, and eventually the incandescent electric lamp further improved safety and convenience, although not brightness.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Waddington, Damer. \"Introduction\". Panoramas, Magic Lanterns and Cinemas. Channel Islands, NJ: Tocan Books. xiii-xv. Print.</ref>\n\n==Precursors==\n{{further|projector}}\nSeveral types of projection systems existed before the invention of the magic lantern. [[Giovanni Fontana (engineer)|Giovanni Fontana]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] and [[Cornelis Drebbel]] described or drew image projectors that had similarities to the magic lantern.\n\nIn the 17th century, there was an immense interest in optics. The [[telescope]] and [[microscope]] were invented (in 1608 and the 1620s respectively) and apart from being useful to some scientists, such instruments were especially popular as entertaining curiosities with people who could afford them.<ref name=rossell2002>{{cite web|first=Deac|last=Rossell|year=2002|title=The Magic Lantern|url=https://www.academia.edu/345943/The_Magic_Lantern}}</ref> The magic lantern would prove a perfect successor.\n\n===Camera obscura===\nThe magic lantern can be seen as a further development of [[camera obscura]]. This is a natural phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening.

Constantijn Huygens wrote very enthusiastically about a camera obscura device that he got from Drebbel in 1622.\n\nThe oldest known document concerning the magic lantern is a page on which Christiaan Huygens made ten small sketches of a skeleton taking off its skull, above which he wrote \"for representations by means of convex glasses with the lamp\" (translated from French).

A separate early magic lantern tradition seems to have been developed in southern Germany and includes lanterns with horizontal cylindrical bodies, while Walgensten's lantern and probably Huygens' both had vertical bodies. This tradition dates at least to 1671, with the arrival of instrument maker Johann Franz Griendel in the city of [[Nuremberg|N\u00fcrnberg]], which Johann Zahn identified as one of the centers of magic lantern production in 1686. Griendel was indicated as the inventor of the magic lantern by Johann Christoph Kohlhans in a 1677 publication.<ref name=Rossell2009 /> It has been suggested that this tradition is older and that instrument maker Johann Wiesel (1583\u20131662) from [[Augsburg]] may have been making magic lanterns earlier on and possibly inspired Griendel and even Huygens. Huygens is known to have studied samples of Wiesel's lens-making and instruments since 1653. Wiesel did make a ship's lantern around 1640 that has much in common with the magic lantern design that Griendel would later apply: a horizontal cylindrical body with a rosette chimney on top, a concave mirror behind a fixture for a candle or lamp inside and a biconvex lens at the front. There is no evidence that Wiesel actually ever made a magic lantern, but in 1674, his successor offered a variety of magic lanterns from the same workshop. This successor is thought to have only continued producing Wiesel's designs after his death in 1662, without adding anything new.<ref>{{cite publication|url=https://www.academia.edu/20378426/The_Origins_of_the_Magic_Lantern_in_Germany_an_example_of_the_use_and_mis-use_of_technology_in_media_history|title=The Origins of the Magic Lantern in Germany|last=Rossell|first=Deac|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Further history==\n===Early adopters===\nBefore 1671, only a small circle of people seemed to have knowledge of the magic lantern, and almost every known report of the device from this period had to do with people that were more or less directly connected to Christiaan Huygens. Despite the rejection expressed in his letters to his brother, Huygens must have familiarized several people with the lantern.\n\nIn 1664 Parisian engineer [[Pierre Petit (engineer)|Pierre Petit]] wrote to Huygens to ask for some specifications of the lantern, because he was trying to construct one after seeing the lantern of \"the dane\" (probably Walgensten). The lantern that Petit was constructing had a concave mirror behind the lamp.<ref name=Petit/> This directed more light through the lens, resulting in a brighter projection, and it would become a standard part of most of the lanterns that were made later. Petit may have copied it from Walgensten, but he expressed that he made a lamp stronger than any he had ever seen.\n\nStarting in 1661, Huygens corresponded with London optical instrument-maker [[Richard Reeve]].<ref name=rossell2002/> Reeve was soon selling magic lanterns, demonstrated one in his shop on 17 May 1663 to [[Balthasar de Monconys]]<ref name=\"picturegoing\">{{cite web|url=http://picturegoing.com/?p=4885|website=picturegoing.com|title=Journal des voyages de Monsieur de Monconys &raquo; Picturegoing|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> and sold one to [[Samuel Pepys]] in August 1666.<ref name=\"pepysdiary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/08/19/|website=pepysdiary.com|title=Sunday 19 August 1666 (The Diary of Samuel Pepys)|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"pepysdiary2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/08/22/|website=pepysdiary.com|title=Wednesday 22 August 1666 (The Diary of Samuel Pepys)|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Optic Projection fig 404.jpg|thumbnail|left|Illustration from Kircher's 1671 ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' - projection of hellfire or purgatory]]\n[[File:1671 kircheri - ars magna lucis et umbrae - 769.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from Kircher's 1671 ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' - projection of Death]]\nOne of Christiaan Huygens' contacts imagined how [[Athanasius Kircher]] would use the magic lantern: \"If he would know about the invention of the Lantern he would surely frighten the cardinals with specters.\"<ref>{{cite publication|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv03_01/huyg003oeuv03_01_0031.php#191T|title=letter from Pierre Guisony to Christiaan Huygens |date=25 March 1660 |language=French}}</ref> Kircher would eventually learn about the existence of the magic lantern via Thomas Walgensten and introduced it as \"Lucerna Magica\" in the widespread 1671 second edition of his book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae''.<ref name=\"ars magna\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gki6ZIbrgQ8C|title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae|first=Athanasius|last=Kircher|year=1671|language=latin |accessdate=19 August 2010 |pages=767\u2013769}}</ref> Kircher claimed that Thomas Walgensten reworked his ideas from the previous edition of this book into a better lantern.

The first known set ''The Elements of Zoology'' became available in 1823, with over 200 images in 56 frames of zoological figures, classified according to the system of the Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]]. The same year many other slides appeared in the company's catalogue: \"The Kings and Queens of England\" (9 sliders taken from David Hume's History of England), \"Astronomical Diagrams and Constellations\" (9 sliders taken from Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel's textbooks), \"Views and Buildings\", Ancient and Modern Costume (62 sliders from various sources).<ref>Philip Carpenter, 1823, A Companion to the Magic Lantern: Part II.</ref> Fifteen sliders of the category \"Humorous\" provided some entertainment, but the focus on education was obvious and very successful.\n\nMass production of slides also made the magic lantern affordable to the masses, opening a market for smaller lanterns with smaller glass sliders, which instead of wooden frames usually had colorful strips of paper glued around their edges.\n\n===Waning popularity===\nThe popularity of magic lanterns waned after the introduction of [[film|movies]] in the 1890s, but they remained a common medium until [[slide projector]]s became widespread during the 1950s.\n\n==Moving images==\n[[File:1870 Plaque de lanterne magique a double systeme--c5620.jpg|thumb|Mice jump into the mouth of a sleeping bearded man on a popular mechanical slide from circa 1870.]]\nThe magic lantern was not only a direct ancestor of the motion picture projector as a means for visual storytelling, but it could itself be used to project moving images.\n\nSome suggestion of movement could be achieved by alternating between pictures of different phases of a motion, but most magic lantern \"animations\" used two glass slides projected together - one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that could be set in motion by hand or by a simple mechanism.\n\nMotion in animated slides was mostly limited to either two phases of a movement or transformation, or a more gradual singular movement (e.g. a train passing through a landscape). These limitations made subjects with repetitive movements popular, like the sails on a windmill turning around or children on a seesaw. Movements could be repeated over and over and could be performed at different speeds.\n\nA common technique that is comparable to the effect of a panning camera makes use of a long slide that is simply pulled slowly through the lantern and usually shows a landscape, sometimes with several phases of a story within the continuous backdrop.\n\nMovement of projected images was also possible by moving the magic lantern itself. This became a staple technique in [[phantasmagoria]] shows in the late 18th century, often with the lantern sliding on rails or riding on small wheels and hidden from the view of the audience behind the projection screen.\n\n===History===\nIn 1645, Kircher had already suggested projecting live insects and shadow puppets from the surface of the mirror in his Steganographic system to perform dramatic scenes.<ref name=Gorman2007>{{cite book|url=https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P333.PDF|page=44|title=Inside the Camera Obscura|first=Michael John|last=Gorman|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nChristiaan Huygens' 1659 sketches (see above) suggest he intended to [[animation|animate]] the skeleton to have it take off its head and place it back on its neck.

A paper slip mask would be quickly pulled away to reveal the red fiery discharge and the bullet from a shooting gun. [[Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach]] visited Themme's shop and liked the effects, but was disappointed about the very simple mechanisms.

A common example showed a creature that could move the pupils in its eyes, as if looking in all directions. A long piece of glass could show a procession of figures, or a train with several wagons. Quite convincing illusions of moving waves on a seas or lake have also been achieved with this method.<ref name=luikerbew1>{{cite web|title=Luikerwaal - Mechanical Slides |url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/newframe_uk.htm?/bewegend1_uk.htm|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref>\n*'''slipping slides with masking''': black paint on portions of the moving plate would mask parts of the underlying image - with a black background - on the stationary glass. This made it possible to hide and then reveal the previous position of a part, for instance a limb, to suggest repetitious movement. The suggested movement would be rather jerky and usually operated quickly. Masking in slides was also often used to create change rather than movement (see: Fig. 6 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a man, his wig and his hat): for instance a person's head could be replaced with that of an animal. More gradual and natural movement was also possible; for instance to make a nose grow very long by slowly moving a masking glass.\n*'''lever slides''': the moving part was operated by a lever. These could show a more natural movement than slipping slides and were mostly used for repetitive movements, for instance a woodcutter raising and lowering his axe, or a girl on a swing.<ref name=luikerbew1/> (see: Fig. 5 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a drinking man raising and lowering his glass + Fig. 8: a lady curtsying)\n*'''pulley slides''': a pulley rotates the moving part and could for instance be used to turn the sails on a windmill<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/wipwaps01_uk.htm|title=Magic lantern - collection of moving magic lantern slides part 1.|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref> (see: fig. 4 on illustration by Van Musschenbroek)\n*'''rack and pinion slides''': turning the handle of a rackwork would rotate or lift the moving part and could for instance be used to turn the sails on a windmill or for having a hot air balloon take off and descend. A more complex astronomical rackwork slide showed the planets and their satellites orbiting around the sun.<ref name=luikerbew1/>\n*'''fantoccini slides''': jointed figures set in motion by levers, thin rods, or cams and worm wheels. A popular version had a somersaulting monkey with arms attached to mechanism that made it tumble with dangling feet.

Typical dissolving views showed landscapes dissolving from day to night or from summer to winter. This was achieved by aligning the projection of two matching images and slowly diminishing the first image while introducing the second image.<ref name=luikerbew1/> The subject and the effect of magic lantern dissolving views is similar to the popular [[Diorama]] theatre paintings that originated in Paris in 1822. 19th century magic lantern broadsides often used the terms ''dissolving view'', ''dioramic view'', or simply ''diorama'' interchangeably.<ref name=HuhtamoReview/>\n\nThe effect was reportedly invented by phantasmagoria pioneer [[Paul de Philipsthal]] while in Ireland in 1803 or 1804. He thought of using two lanterns to make the spirit of Samuel appear out of a mist in his representation of the [[Witch of Endor]]. While working out the desired effect, he got the idea of using the technique with landscapes. An 1812 newspaper about a London performance indicates that De Philipsthal presented what was possibly a relatively early incarnation of a dissolving views show, describing it as a \"a series of landscapes (in imitation of moonlight), which insensibly change to various scenes producing a very magical effect.\u201d<ref name=Mirror1842>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LUMFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, And Instruction|page=98|year=1842}}</ref><ref name=Heard2006/>\n\nAnother possible inventor is [[Henry Langdon Childe]], who purportedly once worked for De Philipsthal.<ref name=Heard2006/> He is said to have invented the dissolving views in 1807, and to have improved and completed the technique in 1818.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=MvBeAAAAcAAJ&dq=%22henry%20langdon%20childe%22&pg=PA372#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20langdon%20childe%22&f=false|title=The Art-journal, New Series, Volume XIII|year=1874}}</ref> The oldest known use of the term \"dissolving views\" occurs on playbills for Childe's shows at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in London in 1837.<ref name=HuhtamoReview/> Childe further popularized the dissolving views at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in the early 1840s.<ref name=Mirror1842/>\n\nDespite later reports about the early invention, and apart from De Philipsthal's 1812 performance, no reports of dissolving view shows before the 1820s are known. Some cases may involve confusion with the Diorama or similar media. In 1826, Scottish magician and ventriloquist M. Henry's introduced what he described as \"beautiful dissolvent scenes,\" \"imperceptibly changing views,\" \"dissolvent views,\" and \"Magic Views\"\u2014created \"by Machinery invented by M. Henry.\" In 1827, Henry Langdon Childe presented \"Scenic Views, showing the various effects of light and shade,\" with a series of subjects that became classics for the dissolving views. In December 1827, De Philipsthal returned with a show that included \"various splendid views (...) transforming themselves imperceptibly (as if it were by Magic) from one form into another.\"<ref name=HuhtamoReview/><ref name=Heard2006/>\n\nBiunial lanterns, with two projecting optical sets in one apparatus, were produced to more easily project dissolving views. Possibly the first horizontal biunial lantern, dubbed the \"Biscenascope\" was made by the optician Mr. Clarke and presented at the Royal Adelaide Gallery in London on December 5, 1840.<ref name=Mirror1842/> The earliest known illustration of a vertical biunial lantern, probably provided by E.G. Wood, appeared in Horne & Thornthwaite catalogue in 1857.<ref name=\"The Magic Lantern Society p. 21-22\"/> Later on triple lanterns enabled additional effects, for instance the effect of snow falling while a green landscape dissolves into a snowy winter version.\n\nA mechanical device could be fitted on the magic lantern, which locked up a diaphragm on the first slide slowly whilst a diaphragm on a second slide opened simultaneously.<ref name=Heard2006/>\n\nPhilip Carpenter's copper-plate printing process, introduced in 1823, may have made it much easier to create duplicate slides with printed outlines that could then be colored differently to create dissolving view slides.<ref name=Heard2006/> However, all early dissolving view slides seem to have been hand-painted.<ref name=HuhtamoReview>{{cite journal|title=Ghost Notes: Reading Mervyn Heard\u2019s Phantasmagoria.

The photographed body belonged to Rudge and Friese-Greene posed for the head. The slides probably provided the very first trick photography sequence projection.

Showmen used rear projection, mobile or portable projectors and all kinds of effects to produce convincing [[necromancy|necromantic]] experiences. It was very popular in Europe from the late 18th century to well into the 19th century.\n\nIt is thought that optical devices like concave mirrors and the camera obscura have been used since antiquity to fool spectators into believing they saw real gods and spirits,<ref name=Heard2006>Heard, Mervyn. ''PHANTASMAGORIA: The Secret History of the Magic Lantern''.

He patented a mobile \"Fantascope\" lantern in 1798.<ref name=Heard2006/>\n\n==Royal Polytechnic Institution shows==\nWhen it opened in 1838, The Royal Polytechnic Institution in London became a very popular and influential venue with all kinds of magic lantern shows as an important part of its program. At the main theatre, with 500 seats, lanternists would make good use of a battery of six large lanterns running on tracked tables to project the finely detailed images of extra large slides on the 648 square feet screen. The magic lantern was used to illustrate lectures, concerts, pantomimes and other forms of theatre. Popular magic lantern presentations included Henry Langon Childe's dissolving views, his chromatrope, phantasmagoria and mechanical slides.<ref name=Heard2006/><ref>{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=chQiAQAAMAAJ&dq=childe%20polytechnic&pg=PA410#v=onepage&q=childe%20polytechnic&f=false|title=The Magazine of Science, and Schools of Art - Vol. IV|year=1843|page=410}}</ref>\n\n==Utushi-e==\nUtushi-e is a type of magic lantern show that became popular in Japan in the 19th century. The Dutch probably introduced the magic lantern in Japan before the 1760s. A new style for magic lantern shows was introduced by Kameya Toraku I, who first performed in 1803 in [[Edo]]. Possibly the phantasmagoria shows (popular in the west at that moment) inspired the rear projection technique, moving images and ghost stories. Japanese showmen developed lightweight wooden projectors (furo) that were handheld so that several performers could move the projections of different colourful figures move around the screen at the same time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.f.waseda.jp/kusahara/Utsushi-e/What_Is_Utsushi-e.html|title=What is Utsushi-e?|website=www.f.waseda.jp}}</ref> The Western techniques of mechanical slides were combined with traditional Japanese skills\u2014especially from [[Karakuri puppet]]s\u2014to further animate the figures and for special effects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.f.waseda.jp/kusahara/Utsushi-e/Taneita(Slides).html|title=Taneita(Slides)|website=www.f.waseda.jp}}</ref>\n\n==Today==\nSome enthusiasts claim that the brilliant quality of color in lantern slides is unsurpassed by successive projection media.

The magic lantern was in wide use from the 18th century until the mid-20th century, when it was superseded by a compact version that could hold many 35&nbsp;mm photographic slides: the [[slide projector]].\n\n==Technology==\n\n===Apparatus===\n[[File:1721?

[[Stereopticon]]s added more powerful light sources to optimize the projection of photographic slides.\n\n===Slides===\nOriginally the pictures were hand painted on glass slides. Initially, figures were rendered with black paint but soon transparent colors were also used. Sometimes the painting was done on oiled paper. Usually black paint was used as a background to block superfluous light, so the figures could be projected without distracting borders or frames. Many slides were finished with a layer of transparent lacquer, but in a later period cover glasses were also used to protect the painted layer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen1_uk.htm|title=All about lantern slides (1)|publisher=}}</ref> Most handmade slides were mounted in wood frames with a round or square opening for the picture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen2_uk.htm|title=All about magic lantern slides (2)|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:10 Story about a boy falling in a barrel of honey.JPG|thumb|left|A paper rimmed mass-produced slide.]]\nAfter 1820 the manufacturing of hand colored printed slides started, often making use of [[decalcomania]] transfers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen1_uk.htm#decal|title=All about lantern slides (1)|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref> Many manufactured slides were produced on strips of glass with several pictures on them and rimmed with a strip of glued paper.\n\nThe first photographic lantern slides, called ''hyalotypes'', were invented by the German-born brothers Ernst Wilhelm (William) and [[Frederick Langenheim|Friedrich (Frederick) Langenheim]] in 1848 in [[Philadelphia]] and patented in 1850.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US7784A/en|title=Improvement in photographic pictures on glass}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/23363210/Glass_Transparencies_Marketing_Photographys_Luminosity_and_Precision_2016_|title=Glass Transparencies: Marketing Photography\u2019s Luminosity and Precision|last=[[Kim Timby|Timby]]|first=[[Kim Timby|Kim]]|year=2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historiccamera.com/cgi-bin/librarium2/pm.cgi?action=app_display&app=datasheet&app_id=1799&|title=William and Frederick Langenheim at Historic Camera|website=historiccamera.com}}</ref>\n\n===Light sources===\nApart from sunlight, the only light sources available at the time of invention in the 17th century were candles and oil lamps, which were very inefficient and produced very dim projected images. The invention of the [[Argand lamp]] in the 1790s helped to make the images brighter. The invention of [[limelight]] in the 1820s made them very much brighter. The invention of the intensely bright electric [[arc lamp]] in the 1860s eliminated the need for combustible gases or hazardous chemicals, and eventually the incandescent electric lamp further improved safety and convenience, although not brightness.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Waddington, Damer. \"Introduction\".

[[Giovanni Fontana (engineer)|Giovanni Fontana]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] and [[Cornelis Drebbel]] described or drew image projectors that had similarities to the magic lantern.\n\nIn the 17th century, there was an immense interest in optics. The [[telescope]] and [[microscope]] were invented (in 1608 and the 1620s respectively) and apart from being useful to some scientists, such instruments were especially popular as entertaining curiosities with people who could afford them.<ref name=rossell2002>{{cite web|first=Deac|last=Rossell|year=2002|title=The Magic Lantern|url=https://www.academia.edu/345943/The_Magic_Lantern}}</ref> The magic lantern would prove a perfect successor.\n\n===Camera obscura===\nThe magic lantern can be seen as a further development of [[camera obscura]]. This is a natural phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. It was known at least since the 5th century BCE and experimented with in darkened rooms at least since circa 1000&nbsp;CE. The use of a lens in the hole has been traced back to circa 1550. The portable camera obscura box with a lens was developed in the 17th century. Dutch inventor [[Cornelis Drebbel]] is thought to have sold one to Dutch poet, composer and diplomat [[Constantijn Huygens]] in 1622,<ref name=Snyder>{{cite web|title=Eye of the Beholder|last=Snyder|first=Laura J.|year=2015|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=EQJ-BAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT110&ots=fqygKmz1u-&dq=friedrich%20risner%20camera%20obscura&pg=PT110#v=onepage&q=friedrich%20risner%20camera%20obscura&f=false}}</ref> while the oldest known clear description of a box-type camera is in German Jesuit scientist [[Gaspar Schott]]'s 1657 book ''Magia universalis natur\u00e6 et artis''.\n\n===Steganographic mirror===\n[[File:1645 kircher - steganographia.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Kircher's Steganographic mirror in his 1645 book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'']]\nThe 1645 first edition of German Jesuit scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' included a description of his invention, the \"Steganographic Mirror\": a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long-distance communication.

Christiaan's father Constantijn had been acquainted with Cornelis Drebbel who used some unidentified optical techniques to transform himself and summon wonderful appearances in magical performances. Constantijn Huygens wrote very enthusiastically about a camera obscura device that he got from Drebbel in 1622.\n\nThe oldest known document concerning the magic lantern is a page on which Christiaan Huygens made ten small sketches of a skeleton taking off its skull, above which he wrote \"for representations by means of convex glasses with the lamp\" (translated from French).

In a 1662 letter to his brother [[Lodewijck Huygens|Lodewijk]] he claimed he thought of it as some old \"bagatelle\" and seemed convinced that it would harm the family's reputation if people found out the lantern came from him.

A separate early magic lantern tradition seems to have been developed in southern Germany and includes lanterns with horizontal cylindrical bodies, while Walgensten's lantern and probably Huygens' both had vertical bodies. This tradition dates at least to 1671, with the arrival of instrument maker Johann Franz Griendel in the city of [[Nuremberg|N\u00fcrnberg]], which Johann Zahn identified as one of the centers of magic lantern production in 1686. Griendel was indicated as the inventor of the magic lantern by Johann Christoph Kohlhans in a 1677 publication.<ref name=Rossell2009 /> It has been suggested that this tradition is older and that instrument maker Johann Wiesel (1583\u20131662) from [[Augsburg]] may have been making magic lanterns earlier on and possibly inspired Griendel and even Huygens. Huygens is known to have studied samples of Wiesel's lens-making and instruments since 1653. Wiesel did make a ship's lantern around 1640 that has much in common with the magic lantern design that Griendel would later apply: a horizontal cylindrical body with a rosette chimney on top, a concave mirror behind a fixture for a candle or lamp inside and a biconvex lens at the front. There is no evidence that Wiesel actually ever made a magic lantern, but in 1674, his successor offered a variety of magic lanterns from the same workshop. This successor is thought to have only continued producing Wiesel's designs after his death in 1662, without adding anything new.<ref>{{cite publication|url=https://www.academia.edu/20378426/The_Origins_of_the_Magic_Lantern_in_Germany_an_example_of_the_use_and_mis-use_of_technology_in_media_history|title=The Origins of the Magic Lantern in Germany|last=Rossell|first=Deac|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Further history==\n===Early adopters===\nBefore 1671, only a small circle of people seemed to have knowledge of the magic lantern, and almost every known report of the device from this period had to do with people that were more or less directly connected to Christiaan Huygens. Despite the rejection expressed in his letters to his brother, Huygens must have familiarized several people with the lantern.\n\nIn 1664 Parisian engineer [[Pierre Petit (engineer)|Pierre Petit]] wrote to Huygens to ask for some specifications of the lantern, because he was trying to construct one after seeing the lantern of \"the dane\" (probably Walgensten). The lantern that Petit was constructing had a concave mirror behind the lamp.<ref name=Petit/> This directed more light through the lens, resulting in a brighter projection, and it would become a standard part of most of the lanterns that were made later. Petit may have copied it from Walgensten, but he expressed that he made a lamp stronger than any he had ever seen.\n\nStarting in 1661, Huygens corresponded with London optical instrument-maker [[Richard Reeve]].<ref name=rossell2002/> Reeve was soon selling magic lanterns, demonstrated one in his shop on 17 May 1663 to [[Balthasar de Monconys]]<ref name=\"picturegoing\">{{cite web|url=http://picturegoing.com/?p=4885|website=picturegoing.com|title=Journal des voyages de Monsieur de Monconys &raquo; Picturegoing|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> and sold one to [[Samuel Pepys]] in August 1666.<ref name=\"pepysdiary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/08/19/|website=pepysdiary.com|title=Sunday 19 August 1666 (The Diary of Samuel Pepys)|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"pepysdiary2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/08/22/|website=pepysdiary.com|title=Wednesday 22 August 1666 (The Diary of Samuel Pepys)|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Optic Projection fig 404.jpg|thumbnail|left|Illustration from Kircher's 1671 ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' - projection of hellfire or purgatory]]\n[[File:1671 kircheri - ars magna lucis et umbrae - 769.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from Kircher's 1671 ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' - projection of Death]]\nOne of Christiaan Huygens' contacts imagined how [[Athanasius Kircher]] would use the magic lantern: \"If he would know about the invention of the Lantern he would surely frighten the cardinals with specters.\"<ref>{{cite publication|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv03_01/huyg003oeuv03_01_0031.php#191T|title=letter from Pierre Guisony to Christiaan Huygens |date=25 March 1660 |language=French}}</ref> Kircher would eventually learn about the existence of the magic lantern via Thomas Walgensten and introduced it as \"Lucerna Magica\" in the widespread 1671 second edition of his book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae''.<ref name=\"ars magna\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gki6ZIbrgQ8C|title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae|first=Athanasius|last=Kircher|year=1671|language=latin |accessdate=19 August 2010 |pages=767\u2013769}}</ref> Kircher claimed that Thomas Walgensten reworked his ideas from the previous edition of this book into a better lantern.

The same year many other slides appeared in the company's catalogue: \"The Kings and Queens of England\" (9 sliders taken from David Hume's History of England), \"Astronomical Diagrams and Constellations\" (9 sliders taken from Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel's textbooks), \"Views and Buildings\", Ancient and Modern Costume (62 sliders from various sources).<ref>Philip Carpenter, 1823, A Companion to the Magic Lantern: Part II.</ref> Fifteen sliders of the category \"Humorous\" provided some entertainment, but the focus on education was obvious and very successful.\n\nMass production of slides also made the magic lantern affordable to the masses, opening a market for smaller lanterns with smaller glass sliders, which instead of wooden frames usually had colorful strips of paper glued around their edges.\n\n===Waning popularity===\nThe popularity of magic lanterns waned after the introduction of [[film|movies]] in the 1890s, but they remained a common medium until [[slide projector]]s became widespread during the 1950s.\n\n==Moving images==\n[[File:1870 Plaque de lanterne magique a double systeme--c5620.jpg|thumb|Mice jump into the mouth of a sleeping bearded man on a popular mechanical slide from circa 1870.]]\nThe magic lantern was not only a direct ancestor of the motion picture projector as a means for visual storytelling, but it could itself be used to project moving images.\n\nSome suggestion of movement could be achieved by alternating between pictures of different phases of a motion, but most magic lantern \"animations\" used two glass slides projected together - one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that could be set in motion by hand or by a simple mechanism.\n\nMotion in animated slides was mostly limited to either two phases of a movement or transformation, or a more gradual singular movement (e.g. a train passing through a landscape). These limitations made subjects with repetitive movements popular, like the sails on a windmill turning around or children on a seesaw. Movements could be repeated over and over and could be performed at different speeds.\n\nA common technique that is comparable to the effect of a panning camera makes use of a long slide that is simply pulled slowly through the lantern and usually shows a landscape, sometimes with several phases of a story within the continuous backdrop.\n\nMovement of projected images was also possible by moving the magic lantern itself. This became a staple technique in [[phantasmagoria]] shows in the late 18th century, often with the lantern sliding on rails or riding on small wheels and hidden from the view of the audience behind the projection screen.\n\n===History===\nIn 1645, Kircher had already suggested projecting live insects and shadow puppets from the surface of the mirror in his Steganographic system to perform dramatic scenes.<ref name=Gorman2007>{{cite book|url=https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P333.PDF|page=44|title=Inside the Camera Obscura|first=Michael John|last=Gorman|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nChristiaan Huygens' 1659 sketches (see above) suggest he intended to [[animation|animate]] the skeleton to have it take off its head and place it back on its neck.

Wheels were cut from the glass plate with a diamond and rotated by a thread that was spun around small brass wheels attached to the glass wheels. A paper slip mask would be quickly pulled away to reveal the red fiery discharge and the bullet from a shooting gun.

A common example showed a creature that could move the pupils in its eyes, as if looking in all directions. A long piece of glass could show a procession of figures, or a train with several wagons. Quite convincing illusions of moving waves on a seas or lake have also been achieved with this method.<ref name=luikerbew1>{{cite web|title=Luikerwaal - Mechanical Slides |url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/newframe_uk.htm?/bewegend1_uk.htm|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref>\n*'''slipping slides with masking''': black paint on portions of the moving plate would mask parts of the underlying image - with a black background - on the stationary glass. This made it possible to hide and then reveal the previous position of a part, for instance a limb, to suggest repetitious movement. The suggested movement would be rather jerky and usually operated quickly. Masking in slides was also often used to create change rather than movement (see: Fig. 6 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a man, his wig and his hat): for instance a person's head could be replaced with that of an animal. More gradual and natural movement was also possible; for instance to make a nose grow very long by slowly moving a masking glass.\n*'''lever slides''': the moving part was operated by a lever. These could show a more natural movement than slipping slides and were mostly used for repetitive movements, for instance a woodcutter raising and lowering his axe, or a girl on a swing.<ref name=luikerbew1/> (see: Fig. 5 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a drinking man raising and lowering his glass + Fig. 8: a lady curtsying)\n*'''pulley slides''': a pulley rotates the moving part and could for instance be used to turn the sails on a windmill<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/wipwaps01_uk.htm|title=Magic lantern - collection of moving magic lantern slides part 1.|website=www.luikerwaal.com}}</ref> (see: fig. 4 on illustration by Van Musschenbroek)\n*'''rack and pinion slides''': turning the handle of a rackwork would rotate or lift the moving part and could for instance be used to turn the sails on a windmill or for having a hot air balloon take off and descend. A more complex astronomical rackwork slide showed the planets and their satellites orbiting around the sun.<ref name=luikerbew1/>\n*'''fantoccini slides''': jointed figures set in motion by levers, thin rods, or cams and worm wheels.

Typical dissolving views showed landscapes dissolving from day to night or from summer to winter. This was achieved by aligning the projection of two matching images and slowly diminishing the first image while introducing the second image.<ref name=luikerbew1/> The subject and the effect of magic lantern dissolving views is similar to the popular [[Diorama]] theatre paintings that originated in Paris in 1822. 19th century magic lantern broadsides often used the terms ''dissolving view'', ''dioramic view'', or simply ''diorama'' interchangeably.<ref name=HuhtamoReview/>\n\nThe effect was reportedly invented by phantasmagoria pioneer [[Paul de Philipsthal]] while in Ireland in 1803 or 1804. He thought of using two lanterns to make the spirit of Samuel appear out of a mist in his representation of the [[Witch of Endor]]. While working out the desired effect, he got the idea of using the technique with landscapes. An 1812 newspaper about a London performance indicates that De Philipsthal presented what was possibly a relatively early incarnation of a dissolving views show, describing it as a \"a series of landscapes (in imitation of moonlight), which insensibly change to various scenes producing a very magical effect.\u201d<ref name=Mirror1842>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LUMFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, And Instruction|page=98|year=1842}}</ref><ref name=Heard2006/>\n\nAnother possible inventor is [[Henry Langdon Childe]], who purportedly once worked for De Philipsthal.<ref name=Heard2006/> He is said to have invented the dissolving views in 1807, and to have improved and completed the technique in 1818.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=MvBeAAAAcAAJ&dq=%22henry%20langdon%20childe%22&pg=PA372#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20langdon%20childe%22&f=false|title=The Art-journal, New Series, Volume XIII|year=1874}}</ref> The oldest known use of the term \"dissolving views\" occurs on playbills for Childe's shows at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in London in 1837.<ref name=HuhtamoReview/> Childe further popularized the dissolving views at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in the early 1840s.<ref name=Mirror1842/>\n\nDespite later reports about the early invention, and apart from De Philipsthal's 1812 performance, no reports of dissolving view shows before the 1820s are known. Some cases may involve confusion with the Diorama or similar media. In 1826, Scottish magician and ventriloquist M. Henry's introduced what he described as \"beautiful dissolvent scenes,\" \"imperceptibly changing views,\" \"dissolvent views,\" and \"Magic Views\"\u2014created \"by Machinery invented by M. Henry.\" In 1827, Henry Langdon Childe presented \"Scenic Views, showing the various effects of light and shade,\" with a series of subjects that became classics for the dissolving views. In December 1827, De Philipsthal returned with a show that included \"various splendid views (...) transforming themselves imperceptibly (as if it were by Magic) from one form into another.\"<ref name=HuhtamoReview/><ref name=Heard2006/>\n\nBiunial lanterns, with two projecting optical sets in one apparatus, were produced to more easily project dissolving views. Possibly the first horizontal biunial lantern, dubbed the \"Biscenascope\" was made by the optician Mr. Clarke and presented at the Royal Adelaide Gallery in London on December 5, 1840.<ref name=Mirror1842/> The earliest known illustration of a vertical biunial lantern, probably provided by E.G. Wood, appeared in Horne & Thornthwaite catalogue in 1857.<ref name=\"The Magic Lantern Society p. 21-22\"/> Later on triple lanterns enabled additional effects, for instance the effect of snow falling while a green landscape dissolves into a snowy winter version.\n\nA mechanical device could be fitted on the magic lantern, which locked up a diaphragm on the first slide slowly whilst a diaphragm on a second slide opened simultaneously.<ref name=Heard2006/>\n\nPhilip Carpenter's copper-plate printing process, introduced in 1823, may have made it much easier to create duplicate slides with printed outlines that could then be colored differently to create dissolving view slides.<ref name=Heard2006/> However, all early dissolving view slides seem to have been hand-painted.<ref name=HuhtamoReview>{{cite journal|title=Ghost Notes: Reading Mervyn Heard\u2019s Phantasmagoria.

The Dutch probably introduced the magic lantern in Japan before the 1760s. A new style for magic lantern shows was introduced by Kameya Toraku I, who first performed in 1803 in [[Edo]]. Possibly the phantasmagoria shows (popular in the west at that moment) inspired the rear projection technique, moving images and ghost stories.

It recounts Hopkins' racing his horse in Arabia in 1891 against [[Bedouin]]s riding pure-blooded [[Arabian horse]]s. The movie was written by [[John Fusco]] and directed by [[Joe Johnston]]. It stars [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Zuleikha Robinson]], and [[Omar Sharif]].\n\n''Hidalgo'' was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]] on  March 5, 2004. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews and was a box office disappointment, grossing $108 million against budget of $100 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1890, Frank T. Hopkins and his mustang, Hidalgo, are part of [[Buffalo Bill]]'s [[Wild West]] show, where they are advertised as \"the world's greatest endurance horse and rider.\" Hopkins had been a famous long-distance rider, a cowboy, and a dispatch rider for the United States government; in the latter capacity he carried a message to the [[7th Cavalry Regiment|U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment]] authorizing the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] of [[Lakota Sioux]]. Hopkins was filled with regret and shame following the massacre and he falls into an alcoholic depression. \n\nChief Eagle Horn, who performs alongside Hopkins, approaches Hopkins and Bill about helping the mustangs (wild horses) that have been rounded up by the US government with the intent to euthanize them to make way for farmland. Bill says there's nothing he can do, but Hopkins decides to help out in whatever way he can.  \n\nWealthy [[Sheikh]] Riyadh has sent his attach\u00e9 Aziz, accompanied by Rau Rasmussen, to ask the show to either stop using the phrase \"the world's greatest endurance horse and rider\" or allow Hopkins and Hidalgo to prove themselves by entering into the \"Ocean of Fire\": an annual 3,000-mile race across the [[Najd]] desert region. The Sheikh is custodian of the ''[[al Khamsa|al-Khamsa]]'' line, considered to be the greatest distance horses in the world, and traditionally the race has been restricted to pure-bred [[Arabian horse]]s and [[Bedouin]] or [[Arab]] riders.\n \nIn addition to the grueling conditions, prevailing animosity and contempt for a Christian \"[[infidel]]\" and \"impure\" horse, horse and rider face stiff competition, including the wealthy and unscrupulous British horse breeder Lady Anne Davenport. Hopkins' opponents try to sabotage him multiple times, such as bribing soldiers who are guarding a well to pretend the well is dry. \n\nTo complicate matters, Sheikh Riyadh has promised his daughter, Jazira, his only surviving child, in marriage to the prince riding the Sheikh's horse Al-Hattal, should he win. She would become his fifth wife and no more than a slave. Jazira hopes to prevent this by giving Hopkins advice and information to help him win, thereby resulting in greater danger for them both. Katib, Sheikh Riyadh's outcast brigand nephew, who will stop at nothing to gain control of the al-Khamsa line, raids the race camp looking for Al-Hattal, but the prince rides away with the horse. Aziz betrays the Sheikh by stealing his family's journal of horse breeding and gives it to Katib. Katib also kidnaps Jazira, and threatens to kill her unless he gets his uncle's prize stallion racer as her ransom. Hopkins manages to rescue Jazira, along with the journal, and kills Aziz. However, Davenport and Katib try to sabotage the race by eliminating the rival riders. Davenport pays Katib to kill Hidalgo and steal Al-Hattal so her mare will win the race and she can breed her with the Sheikh's horse.\n\nFor Hopkins the Ocean of Fire becomes not only a matter of pride, honor and survival, but of identity: it emerges that his father was European American while his mother was Lakota Sioux. The Lakota call him \"Blue Child\" or \"Far Rider.\" As a [[Mixed-race|half-breed]] he feels sympathy and pity for his mother's people, but does not generally reveal his heritage, especially after the [[Wounded Knee massacre]], for which he feels partly responsible. Jazira compares his relation to his heritage to her desire to avoid wearing the [[sartorial hijab|veil]], saying that he mustn't \"go through life hiding what God made you. ... like me.\"\n\nIt is forbidden to help other riders who are injured or whose horses have succumbed to the harsh conditions, but when Sakr, another rider falls into quicksand, Hopkins drags him out. Nearing the end of the race, Hopkins is ambushed by Katib and falls into a trap, severely injuring Hidalgo. Sakr helps him out of the pit and fights Katib's men but is eventually shot. Hopkins manages to overpower the men and finally kills Katib. \n\nHowever, Hidalgo is unable to stand up and Hopkins is dying of thirst. He considers shooting Hidalgo to alleviate his suffering, but is unable to bring himself to do it. Kneeling, he chants a prayer to ''[[Wakan Tanka]]'' as a possible death song, and images of Lakota elders and his mother appear before him before Hidalgo suddenly struggles up, and Hopkins rides bareback to come from behind to win the race, surpassing Davenports mare and the prince on Al-Hattal. Hopkins wins the respect and admiration of the Arabs, and becomes friends with the Sheikh, giving him his revolver as a gift, as the Sheikh is a great admirer of the Wild West and its stories. As he bids farewell to an unveiled Jazira, she asks him if he is fulfilling the traditional Western tales' ending where the cowboy rides away into the setting sun and calls him Blue Child as she smiles kindly at him and turns to go.\n\nReturning to the United States, Frank uses his winnings to buy the mustangs from the government, therefore saving them from death. The wild horses are released and Frank frees Hidalgo to join them in the wilderness. The epilogue states that Hopkins went on to reportedly win 400 long-distance races and was an outspoken supporter for wild mustangs until his death in 1951, while Hidalgo's descendants live free in the wilderness in and around Oklahoma.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as [[Frank Hopkins]], a noted long-distance rider.\n* [[Zuleikha Robinson]] as Jazira, determined daughter of the Sheikh.\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as Sheikh Riyadh, an insightful leader.

Try this on for size - Hopkins claimed to be the grandson of [[Geronimo]] who, he confided, was really a Sioux and not an [[Apache]] at all.  Hopkins, according to himself and wife, was very popular with the Indians because he was half Sioux himself, his mother being a lady called Nah-Kwa - her more formal name was Valley Naw-Kwa or \"Valley of Silence\" - hardly fitting for a woman who had such illustrious relatives. Hopkins spoke \"the Indian language\" so he was a natural interpreter for the Army - although his name does not appear on any treaty documents where the interpreters are listed or in any correspondence in government files wherein interpreters were needed. \n}}</ref>\n\nBut, [[Nakota]] filmmaker [[Angelique Midthunder]] said during the controversy that \"the story of the half Indian who took his pinto mustang across the sea to race in the big desert has been told to children of the northern plains tribes for generations.\"<ref name=\"hopkins\">[http://www.frankhopkins.com/articles.html \"Frank Hopkins\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612194625/http://www.frankhopkins.com/articles.html |date=2007-06-12 }}, Official Website</ref> Lakota elder Sonny Richards writes, \"Kaiyuzeya Sunkanyanke (Frank Hopkins) was a South Dakota native and Lakota half-breed.\" <ref name=\"hopkins\"/>\n\nBased on Hopkins' account of his mixed-race ancestry, the movie production employed Lakota historians, medicine men, and tribal leaders as consultants to advise during every scene that represented their culture. Many of the Ghost Dancers who reenact the sacred ceremony of 1890 in ''Hidalgo'' had participated in the film ''[[Thunderheart]]'' (1992) and the mini-series ''[[Dreamkeeper]]'', both written by Fusco. The screenwriter was adopted as an honorary relative of the Oglala Nation in a ''Hunkyapi'' ceremony (Making of Relatives) on September 3, 1989 on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]].{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nBecause the Disney Corporation marketed the movie as a true story, some historians criticized the film both because of the legendary status of Hopkins' claims and for the film's divergence from his accounts.<ref name=hoax>[http://www.thelongridersguild.com/hopkins.htm \"The Frank Hopkins Hoax\"], The Longriders Guild</ref> They contend that many of the events, especially the featured race, never took place.<ref>[http://hnn.us/articles/3881.html Anthony B.

By Hopkins' original account, he decided to leave his horse in Arabia after the race.<ref name=basha/>\n\nIn 2006, [[John Fusco]], the screenwriter of ''Hidalgo'', responded to criticism about the historical basis of the film. He had done research on Hopkins for years. He said that he used parts of Hopkins' 1891 desert memoirs (unpublished during the rider's lifetime) and \"heightened the 'Based On' story to create an entertaining theatrical film.\"  He held that the story of the man and his horse is true. Fusco offered quotes from surviving friends of Hopkins, notably former distance riders Walt and Edith Pyle, and Lt Col William Zimmerman, along with information found in horse history texts, as verification.<ref name=basha/>\n\nAccording to the Longriders Guild, the Saudi Arabian Government say officially that there has never been an \"Ocean of Fire\" race. Hopkins never named the event; he referred to it in his writings as an annual ceremonial ride in the region.<ref name=basha/>  According to the Arab historian Dr. Awad al-Badi, such a lengthy race was impossible. He said,\n\n<blockquote>There is no record or reference to Hopkins with or without his mustangs ever having set foot on Arabian soil. The idea of a historic long-distance Arab horse race is pure nonsense and flies against all reason. Such an event in Arabia any time in the past is impossible simply from a technical, logistical, cultural and geopolitical point of view. It has never been part of our rich traditions and equestrian heritage.<ref name=harrigan>[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=7&section=0&article=26134&d=13&m=5& Peter Harrigan, \"Hidalgo: A Film or Flimflam?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111142157/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=7 |date=2011-11-11 }}, ''Arab News,'' 13 May 2003, accessed 2010-12-28</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Horses==\nSeveral [[American Paint Horse|American Paint horses]] were used to portray Hidalgo.

The Sheikh is custodian of the ''[[al Khamsa|al-Khamsa]]'' line, considered to be the greatest distance horses in the world, and traditionally the race has been restricted to pure-bred [[Arabian horse]]s and [[Bedouin]] or [[Arab]] riders.\n \nIn addition to the grueling conditions, prevailing animosity and contempt for a Christian \"[[infidel]]\" and \"impure\" horse, horse and rider face stiff competition, including the wealthy and unscrupulous British horse breeder Lady Anne Davenport. Hopkins' opponents try to sabotage him multiple times, such as bribing soldiers who are guarding a well to pretend the well is dry. \n\nTo complicate matters, Sheikh Riyadh has promised his daughter, Jazira, his only surviving child, in marriage to the prince riding the Sheikh's horse Al-Hattal, should he win. She would become his fifth wife and no more than a slave. Jazira hopes to prevent this by giving Hopkins advice and information to help him win, thereby resulting in greater danger for them both. Katib, Sheikh Riyadh's outcast brigand nephew, who will stop at nothing to gain control of the al-Khamsa line, raids the race camp looking for Al-Hattal, but the prince rides away with the horse. Aziz betrays the Sheikh by stealing his family's journal of horse breeding and gives it to Katib. Katib also kidnaps Jazira, and threatens to kill her unless he gets his uncle's prize stallion racer as her ransom. Hopkins manages to rescue Jazira, along with the journal, and kills Aziz. However, Davenport and Katib try to sabotage the race by eliminating the rival riders. Davenport pays Katib to kill Hidalgo and steal Al-Hattal so her mare will win the race and she can breed her with the Sheikh's horse.\n\nFor Hopkins the Ocean of Fire becomes not only a matter of pride, honor and survival, but of identity: it emerges that his father was European American while his mother was Lakota Sioux. The Lakota call him \"Blue Child\" or \"Far Rider.\" As a [[Mixed-race|half-breed]] he feels sympathy and pity for his mother's people, but does not generally reveal his heritage, especially after the [[Wounded Knee massacre]], for which he feels partly responsible. Jazira compares his relation to his heritage to her desire to avoid wearing the [[sartorial hijab|veil]], saying that he mustn't \"go through life hiding what God made you. ... like me.\"\n\nIt is forbidden to help other rides who are injured or whose horses have succumbed to the harsh conditions, but when Sakr, another rider falls into quicksand, Hopkins drags him out. Nearing the end of the race, Hopkins is ambushed by Katib and falls into a trap, severely injuring Hidalgo. Sakr helps him out of the pit and fights Katib's men but is eventually shot. Hopkins manages to overpower the men and finally kills Katib. \n\nHowever, Hidalgo is unable to stand up and Hopkins is dying of thirst. He considers shooting Hidalgo to alleviate his suffering, but is unable to bring himself to do it. Kneeling, he chants a prayer to ''[[Wakan Tanka]]'' as a possible death song, and images of Lakota elders and his mother appear before him before Hidalgo suddenly struggles up, and Hopkins rides bareback to come from behind to win the race, surpassing Davenports mare and the prince on Al-Hattal. Hopkins wins the respect and admiration of the Arabs, and becomes friends with the Sheikh, giving him his revolver as a gift, as the Sheikh is a great admirer of the Wild West and its stories. As he bids farewell to an unveiled Jazira, she asks him if he is fulfilling the traditional Western tales' ending where the cowboy rides away into the setting sun and calls him Blue Child as she smiles kindly at him and turns to go.\n\nReturning to the United States, Frank uses his winnings to buy the mustangs from the government, therefore saving them from death. The wild horses are released and Frank frees Hidalgo to join them in the wilderness. The epilogue states that Hopkins went on to reportedly win 400 long-distance races and was an outspoken supporter for wild mustangs until his death in 1951, while Hidalgo's descendants live free in the wilderness in and around Oklahoma.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as [[Frank Hopkins]], a noted long-distance rider.\n* [[Zuleikha Robinson]] as Jazira, determined daughter of the Sheikh.\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as Sheikh Riyadh, an insightful leader.

Many of the Ghost Dancers who reenact the sacred ceremony of 1890 in ''Hidalgo'' had participated in the film ''[[Thunderheart]]'' (1992) and the mini-series ''[[Dreamkeeper]]'', both written by Fusco. The screenwriter was adopted as an honorary relative of the Oglala Nation in a ''Hunkyapi'' ceremony (Making of Relatives) on September 3, 1989 on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]].{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nBecause the Disney Corporation marketed the movie as a true story, some historians criticized the film both because of the legendary status of Hopkins' claims and for the film's divergence from his accounts.<ref name=hoax>[http://www.thelongridersguild.com/hopkins.htm \"The Frank Hopkins Hoax\"], The Longriders Guild</ref> They contend that many of the events, especially the featured race, never took place.<ref>[http://hnn.us/articles/3881.html Anthony B.

By Hopkins' original account, he decided to leave his horse in Arabia after the race.<ref name=basha/>\n\nIn 2006, [[John Fusco]], the screenwriter of ''Hidalgo'', responded to criticism about the historical basis of the film. He had done research on Hopkins for years. He said that he used parts of Hopkins' 1891 desert memoirs (unpublished during the rider's lifetime) and \"heightened the 'Based On' story to create an entertaining theatrical film.\"  He held that the story of the man and his horse is true. Fusco offered quotes from surviving friends of Hopkins, notably former distance riders Walt and Edith Pyle, and Lt Col William Zimmerman, along with information found in horse history texts, as verification.<ref name=basha/>\n\nAccording to the Longriders Guild, the Saudi Arabian Government say officially that there has never been an \"Ocean of Fire\" race. Hopkins never named the event; he referred to it in his writings as an annual ceremonial ride in the region.<ref name=basha/>  According to the Arab historian Dr. Awad al-Badi, such a lengthy race was impossible. He said,\n\n<blockquote>There is no record or reference to Hopkins with or without his mustangs ever having set foot on Arabian soil. The idea of a historic long-distance Arab horse race is pure nonsense and flies against all reason. Such an event in Arabia any time in the past is impossible simply from a technical, logistical, cultural and geopolitical point of view.

{"title_page": "Arica School", "text_new": "{{primary sources|date=August 2015}}\nThe '''Arica School''', also known as the '''Arica Institute''' (which is its incorporated educational organization) or simply as '''Arica''', is a [[human potential movement]] group founded in 1968 by [[Bolivia]]n-born philosopher [[Oscar Ichazo]] (1931\u20132020). The school is named after the city of [[Arica, Chile|Arica]], [[Chile]], where Ichazo once lived and where he led an intensive months-long training in 1970 and 1971 before settling in the [[United States]] where the Arica Institute (incorporated in 1971) has since been headquartered.\n\nThe Arica School can be considered, as ''[[Ramparts Magazine|Ramparts]]'' magazine put it in 1973, \"A body of techniques for cosmic consciousness-raising and an ideology to relate to the world in an awakened way.\"<ref>[http://www.ex-premie.org/pages/ramparts73.htm ''Ramparts Magazine''], July 1973, p. 30. (online reproduction)</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThe Arica School's origins began in 1956 when groups of people formed in major cities in South America to study the theory and method that Ichazo was proposing. For fourteen years these different groups studied his teachings. In 1968 Ichazo presented lectures on his theories of Protoanalysis and the ego-fixations at the Institute of Applied Psychology in [[Santiago Chile|Santiago]], Chile.\n\nIchazo's theories are based upon such traditional metaphysical questions such as: \"What is humankind?\"; \"What is the supreme good of humanity?\"; and \"What is the truth that gives meaning and value to human life?\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\n==Basic theory==\nThe entire theory is referred to as based on the idea of the Innate Structure of Mind. That is, the questions come from the Instincts and the Instincts are a result of a pre-existing structure that is the foundation of Mind itself. It is a concept considered logical because there must be a pre-existing order if all minds share essential similarities. <ref>Ichazo, Oscar. The Human Process for Enlightenment and Freedom. 1976. Page 79.</ref>\n\nIchazo refined the ancient concept that a human soul has components by approaching the issue through three instinctual questions that he considered basic to human existence: \"How am I?\", \"Who am I with?\", \"What am I doing?\"<ref>Ichazo, Oscar. Between Metaphysics and Protoanalysis. 1982. Page 47, 50, 51, 58.</ref> Ichazo labeled these conservation, relations, and syntony (later modified to adaptation). Recognizing interactions among the three, he developed a 3 x 3 = 9 component system, which he correlated with several schemas that have long existed in diverse fields: spectrum of light, [[chakras]], physiological systems, the [[Enneagram of Personality|enneagram]], etc.<ref>Ichazo, Oscar. The Human Process for Enlightenment and Freedom. 1976. But he didn\u2019t originally develop the enneagram. Page 79.</ref>\n\nFor example, each component of the psyche was assigned a corresponding color, which was reinforced through a wide variety of self-development exercises. The Hypergnostic meditation utilized the ancient notion of vertically arranged chakras, expanding the seven chakra system widely used in [[Hindu]] meditation into nine by adding the sacrum and the nape of the neck. Modern biology was incorporated into the theory by associating the hypergnostic rings (chakras) with anatomy rather than energy centers.<ref>Nine Hypergnostic Systems workbooks provided by Arica Institute as student materials 1976 and later.</ref>\n\nFor self-observation of habitual patterns, Ichazo employed the enneagram, among other tools. Transformative practices sometimes involved linking a specific [[mudra]] and/or [[B\u012bja|bija]] with each of the nine points of the enneagram. During the first three decades or so, most aspects of his theory that were mapped onto the enneagram were circular mappings (e.g., closing of the spectrum into a circular Rainbow Eye) that involved little or no utilization of the interconnecting lines that constitute the enneagram's form.<ref>\"Movement in the psychic spectrum\" pp 64\u201366 of Human Process.</ref><ref>Ichazo, Oscar. Opening the Rainbow Eye. 1978.</ref><ref>Ichazo, Oscar. Cutting of the Adamantine Pyramid. 1980.</ref> In other words, most of the maps were [[enneagon]]s rather than enneagrams (refer to [[Enneagram (shape)|enneagram figure]] for drawings that show the difference).\n\n==Essence and ego==\nLike some other systems of self-actualization, Arica works with the (ultimately illusory) separation of essence and ego.<ref>Interview with Sam Keen, Psychology Today, July 1973. Reproduced in Interviews with Oscar Ichazo, published by Arica Institute Press 1982. Page 9 ff.</ref> An important aspect of this work is to observe one's habits and reactions in accordance with a typology of nine. However, Ichazo referred to the characterizations as \"fixations\" rather than \"personality types\" and he repeatedly emphasized that every human being contains all nine types (\"we have to awaken all the nine positions\").<ref>Letters to the School, page 73.</ref> The fixation was simply a key to self-discovery,<ref>Letters to the School, page 72.</ref> not a form of identity like one's [[sun sign]] in [[astrology]].\n\nThe inherent difficulty of working with the ego and essence distinction while maintaining an ultimate philosophical stance of [[nondualism]] can be appreciated by mystics of any path. Such \"inner work\" entails the risk of inflating one's ego with notions such as \"I am a special person because I have higher knowledge\" or \"I am aware of my ego, but you are not aware of yours\". To avoid problems that could arise from this delicate type of work, Ichazo emphasized group exercises and honest interpersonal encounters (\"ego reduction\"). He also insisted on secrecy, specifically not propagating the theory without his permission.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} With this essential context in mind a person is prepared to understand Ichazo's position in the enneagram controversy.\n\n==Enneagram of Personality==\nIchazo is considered by many to be the father of the [[Enneagram of Personality]] (usually just called the Enneagram) movement which uses an [[enneagram (shape)|enneagram figure]]. The United States Court of Appeals<ref>[http://floridalawfirm.com/arica.html Arica v. Palmer, 970 F 2d 106<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ruled that Ichazo is the original author of the application of the enneagram figure to a theory of ego fixations (which are the precursor to personality disorders). However, this ruling denied copyright injunction under the \"fair use\" doctrine of copyright law. Because the enneagram symbol is a discovery (not an invention), the legal issue was not use of the symbol but rather the copyrightability of specific \"enneagrams\", meaning symbol plus descriptive words (or other information) associated with each point. Ichazo had earlier described the enneagrams as a set of immutable laws<ref>Letters to the School, page 43.</ref> but he had also said that he \"developed\" the enneagrams.<ref>Letters to the School, page 46.</ref>\n\nIchazo has applied the enneagram figure in connection with his theory of mechanical ego mechanisms which grow out of psychological traumas suffered at an early age in specific aspects of the human psyche.<ref>Interviews with Oscar Ichazo, page 14.</ref> In his basic theory, these aspects of the human psyche include the sense of well-being (conservation instinct); the sense of relations with others (relation instinct); and the sense of adapting to our environment (adaptation instinct). Ichazo's goal with regard to the study of the enneagram is to facilitate the recognition of repetitive, mechanistic thinking and behavior in a person's psychological process and to eliminate the suffering rooted in the attachment to, and identification with, these mechanisms (which, Ichazo teaches, attempt to protect us from suffering but actually tend to perpetuate it).<ref>Interviews with Oscar Ichazo, page 11.</ref>\n\nThe popular use of the Enneagram of Personality (as contrasted with the use of enneagrams within the Arica School) began principally with [[Claudio Naranjo]] who had studied with Ichazo in Chile.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Ichazo considers Naranjo's understanding of the Enneagram to be limited and incomplete.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120803020129/http://www.arica.org/articles/effross.cfm/ \"Interview with Professor Effross\", Arica School website]</ref> Naranjo's major contribution to the Enneagram of Personality was his addition of defense mechanisms to the model developed by Ichazo: \"His contribution to the Enneagram successfully joined the insight and methods of a mystical path of transformation with the intellectual power of a Western psychological model.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=H.|title=The Enneagram|url=https://archive.org/details/enneagramunderst00palm|url-access=registration|year=1991|publisher=HarperCollins|location=San Francisco|pages=[https://archive.org/details/enneagramunderst00palm/page/51 51]}}</ref>\n\n==Influences==\nIt has been suggested that Ichazo \"either came under the influence of the school that taught [[George Gurdjieff|G.I. Gurdjieff]] or, at least, studied under students of Gurdjieff.\"<ref>Tart, Charles. ''Transpersonal Psychologies''. Harper & Row, 1975, p. 331.</ref> Ichazo, however, has denied any connection between his and Gurdjieff's teachings.<ref>http://www.arica.org/articles/trletter.cfm{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Some writers in the Enneagram of Personality field have claimed that the enneagram figure is a Sufi symbol.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Although the symbolism of the number 9 is ancient,<ref>\"The eight is the way to the nine.\" The Sufis, Idries Shah. Octagon Press. Fifth Impression, 1989. p. 191.</ref> there does not appear to be any evidence for the enneagram figure before Gurdjieff<ref>Ouspensky, P.D. In Search of the Miraculous, 1949. p. 287.</ref> in Sufism or elsewhere.<ref>Goldberg, Michael. \"Inside the Enneagram Wars\" in the ''LA Weekly'', October 15, 1993.</ref>\n\nAs presented in later years (post-2000), a large part of Arica is the study of classical philosophy as compared to \"modern\" philosophy.

The school is named after the city of [[Arica, Chile|Arica]], [[Chile]], where Ichazo once lived and where he led an intensive months-long training in 1970 and 1971 before settling in the [[United States]] where the Arica Institute (incorporated in 1971) has since been headquartered.\n\nThe Arica School can be considered, as ''[[Ramparts Magazine|Ramparts]]'' magazine put it in 1973, \"A body of techniques for cosmic consciousness-raising and an ideology to relate to the world in an awakened way.\"<ref>[http://www.ex-premie.org/pages/ramparts73.htm ''Ramparts Magazine''], July 1973, p. 30. (online reproduction)</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThe Arica School's origins began in 1956 when groups of people formed in major cities in South America to study the theory and method that Ichazo was proposing. For fourteen years these different groups studied his teachings. In 1968 Ichazo presented lectures on his theories of Protoanalysis and the ego-fixations at the Institute of Applied Psychology in [[Santiago Chile|Santiago]], Chile.\n\nIchazo's theories are based upon such traditional metaphysical questions such as: \"What is humankind?\"; \"What is the supreme good of humanity?\"; and \"What is the truth that gives meaning and value to human life?\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\n==Basic theory==\nThe entire theory is referred to as based on the idea of the Innate Structure of Mind. That is, the questions come from the Instincts and the Instincts are a result of a pre-existing structure that is the foundation of Mind itself. It is a concept considered logical because there must be a pre-existing order if all minds share essential similarities. <ref>Ichazo, Oscar. The Human Process for Enlightenment and Freedom. 1976. Page 79.</ref>\n\nIchazo refined the ancient concept that a human soul has components by approaching the issue through three instinctual questions that he considered basic to human existence: \"How am I?\", \"Who am I with?\", \"What am I doing?\"<ref>Ichazo, Oscar. Between Metaphysics and Protoanalysis. 1982. Page 47, 50, 51, 58.</ref> Ichazo labeled these conservation, relations, and syntony (later modified to adaptation). Recognizing interactions among the three, he developed a 3 x 3 = 9 component system, which he correlated with several schemas that have long existed in diverse fields: spectrum of light, [[chakras]], physiological systems, the [[Enneagram of Personality|enneagram]], etc.<ref>Ichazo, Oscar. The Human Process for Enlightenment and Freedom. 1976. But he didn\u2019t originally develop the enneagram. Page 79.</ref>\n\nFor example, each component of the psyche was assigned a corresponding color, which was reinforced through a wide variety of self-development exercises. The Hypergnostic meditation utilized the ancient notion of vertically arranged chakras, expanding the seven chakra system widely used in [[Hindu]] meditation into nine by adding the sacrum and the nape of the neck. Modern biology was incorporated into the theory by associating the hypergnostic rings (chakras) with anatomy rather than energy centers.<ref>Nine Hypergnostic Systems workbooks provided by Arica Institute as student materials 1976 and later.</ref>\n\nFor self-observation of habitual patterns, Ichazo employed the enneagram, among other tools. Transformative practices sometimes involved linking a specific [[mudra]] and/or [[B\u012bja|bija]] with each of the nine points of the enneagram. During the first three decades or so, most aspects of his theory that were mapped onto the enneagram were circular mappings (e.g., closing of the spectrum into a circular Rainbow Eye) that involved little or no utilization of the interconnecting lines that constitute the enneagram's form.<ref>\"Movement in the psychic spectrum\" pp 64\u201366 of Human Process.</ref><ref>Ichazo, Oscar. Opening the Rainbow Eye. 1978.</ref><ref>Ichazo, Oscar. Cutting of the Adamantine Pyramid. 1980.</ref> In other words, most of the maps were [[enneagon]]s rather than enneagrams (refer to [[Enneagram (shape)|enneagram figure]] for drawings that show the difference).\n\n==Essence and ego==\nLike some other systems of self-actualization, Arica works with the (ultimately illusory) separation of essence and ego.<ref>Interview with Sam Keen, Psychology Today, July 1973. Reproduced in Interviews with Oscar Ichazo, published by Arica Institute Press 1982. Page 9 ff.</ref> An important aspect of this work is to observe one's habits and reactions in accordance with a typology of nine. However, Ichazo referred to the characterizations as \"fixations\" rather than \"personality types\" and he repeatedly emphasized that every human being contains all nine types (\"we have to awaken all the nine positions\").<ref>Letters to the School, page 73.</ref> The fixation was simply a key to self-discovery,<ref>Letters to the School, page 72.</ref> not a form of identity like one's [[sun sign]] in [[astrology]].\n\nThe inherent difficulty of working with the ego and essence distinction while maintaining an ultimate philosophical stance of [[nondualism]] can be appreciated by mystics of any path. Such \"inner work\" entails the risk of inflating one's ego with notions such as \"I am a special person because I have higher knowledge\" or \"I am aware of my ego, but you are not aware of yours\". To avoid problems that could arise from this delicate type of work, Ichazo emphasized group exercises and honest interpersonal encounters (\"ego reduction\"). He also insisted on secrecy, specifically not propagating the theory without his permission.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} With this essential context in mind a person is prepared to understand Ichazo's position in the enneagram controversy.\n\n==Enneagram of Personality==\nIchazo is considered by many to be the father of the [[Enneagram of Personality]] (usually just called the Enneagram) movement which uses an [[enneagram (shape)|enneagram figure]]. The United States Court of Appeals<ref>[http://floridalawfirm.com/arica.html Arica v. Palmer, 970 F 2d 106<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ruled that Ichazo is the original author of the application of the enneagram figure to a theory of ego fixations (which are the precursor to personality disorders). However, this ruling denied copyright injunction under the \"fair use\" doctrine of copyright law. Because the enneagram symbol is a discovery (not an invention), the legal issue was not use of the symbol but rather the copyrightability of specific \"enneagrams\", meaning symbol plus descriptive words (or other information) associated with each point. Ichazo had earlier described the enneagrams as a set of immutable laws<ref>Letters to the School, page 43.</ref> but he had also said that he \"developed\" the enneagrams.<ref>Letters to the School, page 46.</ref>\n\nIchazo has applied the enneagram figure in connection with his theory of mechanical ego mechanisms which grow out of psychological traumas suffered at an early age in specific aspects of the human psyche.<ref>Interviews with Oscar Ichazo, page 14.</ref> In his basic theory, these aspects of the human psyche include the sense of well-being (conservation instinct); the sense of relations with others (relation instinct); and the sense of adapting to our environment (adaptation instinct). Ichazo's goal with regard to the study of the enneagram is to facilitate the recognition of repetitive, mechanistic thinking and behavior in a person's psychological process and to eliminate the suffering rooted in the attachment to, and identification with, these mechanisms (which, Ichazo teaches, attempt to protect us from suffering but actually tend to perpetuate it).<ref>Interviews with Oscar Ichazo, page 11.</ref>\n\nThe popular use of the Enneagram of Personality (as contrasted with the use of enneagrams within the Arica School) began principally with [[Claudio Naranjo]] who had studied with Ichazo in Chile.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Ichazo considers Naranjo's understanding of the Enneagram to be limited and incomplete.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120803020129/http://www.arica.org/articles/effross.cfm/ \"Interview with Professor Effross\", Arica School website]</ref> Naranjo's major contribution to the Enneagram of Personality was his addition of defense mechanisms to the model developed by Ichazo: \"His contribution to the Enneagram successfully joined the insight and methods of a mystical path of transformation with the intellectual power of a Western psychological model.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=H.|title=The Enneagram|url=https://archive.org/details/enneagramunderst00palm|url-access=registration|year=1991|publisher=HarperCollins|location=San Francisco|pages=[https://archive.org/details/enneagramunderst00palm/page/51 51]}}</ref>\n\n==Influences==\nIt has been suggested that Ichazo \"either came under the influence of the school that taught [[George Gurdjieff|G.I. Gurdjieff]] or, at least, studied under students of Gurdjieff.\"<ref>Tart, Charles. ''Transpersonal Psychologies''.

Rendering can refer to any processing of [[animal product]]s into more useful materials, or, more narrowly, to the rendering of whole animal fatty tissue into purified fats like [[lard]] or [[tallow]]. Rendering can be carried out on an industrial, farm, or kitchen scale.

This material can include the [[fat|fatty]] tissue, bones, and [[offal]], as well as entire carcasses of animals condemned at slaughterhouses and those that have died on farms, in transit, etc. The most common animal sources are [[beef]], [[pork]], [[mutton]], and [[poultry]]. \n\nThe rendering process simultaneously dries the material and separates the fat from the [[bone]] and [[protein]].

In wet processing, either boiling water or steam is added to the material, separating fat into a floating phase. In dry processing, fat is released by dehydrating the raw material.\n* The temperature range used may be high or low.\n* Rendering may be done either in discrete batches or in a continuous process.\n* The processing plant may be operated by an independent company that buys input material from suppliers, or by a packing plant that produces the material in-house.\n\n==Rendering processes for edible products==\nEdible rendering processes are basically meat processing operations and produce [[lard]] or edible [[tallow]] for use in food products. Edible rendering is generally carried out in a continuous process at low temperature (less than the boiling point of water). The process usually consists of finely chopping the edible fat materials (generally fat trimmings from meat cuts), heating them with or without added steam, and then carrying out two or more stages of [[centrifugal separation]]. The first stage separates the liquid water and fat mixture from the solids. The second stage further separates the fat from the water. The solids may be used in food products, pet foods, etc., depending on the original materials. The separated fat may be used in food products, or if in surplus, may be diverted to soap making operations. Most edible rendering is done by meat packing or processing companies.\n\n==Rendering processes for inedible products==\nMaterials that for aesthetic or sanitary reasons are not suitable for human food are the feedstocks for inedible rendering processes. Much of the inedible raw material is rendered using the \"dry\" method. This may be a batch or a continuous process in which the material is heated in a steam-jacketed vessel to drive off the moisture and simultaneously release the fat from the fat cells. The material is first ground, then heated to release the fat and drive off the moisture, percolated to drain off the free fat, and then more fat is pressed out of the solids, which at this stage are called \"cracklings\" or \"dry-rendered tankage\". The cracklings are further ground to make meat and [[bone meal]].\n\nA variation on a dry process involves finely chopping the material, fluidizing it with hot fat, and then evaporating the mixture in one or more evaporator stages. Some inedible rendering is done using a wet process, which is generally a continuous process similar in some ways to that used for edible materials. The material is heated with added steam and then pressed to remove a water-fat mixture that is then separated into fat, water, and fine solids by stages of centrifuging and/or evaporation. The solids from the press are dried and then ground into meat and bone meal. Most independent renderers process only inedible material.\n\n==History==\nThe development of rendering was primarily responsible for the profitable utilization of meat industry by-products, which in turn allowed the development of a massive industrial-scale meat industry that made food more economical for the consumer.\nRendering has been carried out for many centuries, primarily for [[soap]] and [[candle]] making. The earliest rendering was done in a [[kettle]] over an open fire. This type of rendering is still done on farms to make lard (pork fat) for food purposes. With the development of steam boilers, it was possible to use steam-jacketed kettles to make a higher grade product, and reduce fire danger. A further development came in the 19th century with the use of steam digesters: a tank used as a pressure cooker where steam was injected into the material being rendered. This process is a wet rendering process called \"tanking\" and was used for edible and inedible products, although better grades of edible products were made using the open kettle process. After the material is tanked, the free fat is run off, the remaining water (\"tank water\") run into a separate vat, and the solids removed and dried by pressing and steam-drying in a jacketed vessel. The tank water was either run into a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] or it was evaporated to make [[glue]] or protein concentrate to add to [[fertilizer]]. The solids were used for fertilizer.\n\n[[Upton Sinclair]] wrote ''[[The Jungle]]'' (1906), an expos\u00e9 on the Chicago meat processing industry which created public outrage. His work helped the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1907 which paved the way for the creation of the [[FDA]].\n\nThe pressure tank made possible the development of the [[Chicago]] meat industry in the United States, with its concentration in one geographic area, because it allowed the economic disposal of byproducts which would otherwise overwhelm the environment in that area. At first, small companies that sprang up near the packers did the rendering. Later the packers entered the rendering industry. [[Gustavus Swift]], [[Nelson Morris]], and [[Lucius Darling]] were among the early pioneers of the U.S. rendering industry with their personal backing and/or direct participation in the rendering industry.\n\nInnovations came rapidly in the 20th century. Some of these were the uses for rendered products, and others were the rendering methods. In the 1920s, a batch dry rendering process was invented; the material was cooked in horizontal steam-jacketed cylinders (similar to the fertilizer dryers of the day). Advantages claimed for the dry process were economy of energy, better protein yield, faster processing, and fewer obnoxious odors. Over the years, the wet \"tanking\" process was replaced with the dry process. By the end of [[World War II]], most rendering installations used the dry process. In the 1960s, continuous dry processes were introduced, one using a variation of the conventional dry cooker and the other making use of a mincing and evaporation process to dry the material and yield the fat. In the 1980s, high energy costs popularized the various \"wet\" continuous processes. These processes were more energy efficient and allowed the re-use of process vapours to pre-heat or dry the materials during the process.\n\nAfter [[WWII]], synthetic detergents arrived, which displaced soaps in domestic and industrial washing. In the early 1950s, over half of the inedible fat market vanished. Diversion in these materials into animal feeds soon replaced the lost soap market and eventually became the single largest use for inedible fats.\n\nThe widespread use of \"boxed beef\", where the beef was cut into consumer portions at packing plants rather than local butcher shops and markets, meant that fat and meat scraps for renderers stayed at the packing plants and were rendered there by packer renderers, rather than by the independent rendering companies.\n\nThe rejection of animal fats by diet-conscious consumers led to a surplus of edible fats, and the resultant diversion into soapmaking and [[oleochemical]]s, displacing inedible fats and contributing to the market volatility of this commodity.\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\nThe rendering industry is one of the oldest recycling industries, and made possible the development of a large food industry. The industry takes what would otherwise be waste materials and makes useful products such as fuels, soaps, rubber, plastics, etc. At the same time, rendering solves what would otherwise be a major disposal problem. As an example, the United States annually recycles more than 21 million metric tons of highly perishable and noxious organic matter. In 2004, US industry produced over 8 million metric tons of products, of which 1.6 million metric tons were exported.\n\nUsually, materials used as raw materials in the rendering process are susceptible to spoilage. However, after rendering, the materials are much more resistant to spoiling. This is due to the application of heat either through cooking in the wet rendering process or the extraction of fluid in the dry rendering process. The fat obtained can be used as low-cost raw material in making grease, animal feed, soap, candles, [[biodiesel]], and as a feed-stock for the [[chemical]] industry. [[Tallow]], derived from beef waste, is an important raw material in the [[steel]] rolling industry, providing lubrication when compressing steel sheets.\n\nMeat and bones (in a dry, ground state) are converted to ''[[meat and bone meal]]''. Health professionals believe that meat and bone meal in animal feed was the main route for the late-20th century spread of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad-cow disease, BSE), which is also fatal to humans. Early in the 21st century, most countries tightened regulations to prevent this.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentid=BSE_FAQs.xml |title=FAQ on BSE |website=United States Department of Agriculture |access-date=2017-01-28}}</ref>\n\nIf not for the rendering industry, the cost of waste animal material would be high and would place a significant economic and environmental burden on areas involved in industrial scale slaughtering. This cost would manifest itself through the use of expensive sanitary landfills, incinerators, and other similar waste disposal techniques without yielding profit from [[opportunity costs]]. Alternatives to rendering products may not reduce cost.\n\n==Kitchen rendering==\nRendering of fats is also carried out on a kitchen scale by [[chef]]s and home cooks. In the kitchen, rendering is used to transform [[butter]] into [[clarified butter]], [[suet]] into [[tallow]], [[pork]] fat into [[lard]], and chicken fat into [[schmaltz]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Animal slaughter]]\n* [[Animal euthanasia]]\n* [[Dead Horse Bay]]\n* [[Flensing]]\n* [[Whale oil]]\n\n==References==\n===Inline citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General references===\n* Lyman, Howard, F.

{"title_page": "Derivative test", "text_new": "In [[calculus]], a '''derivative test''' uses the [[derivative]]s of a function to locate the [[stationary point|critical point]]s of a function and determine whether each point is a [[local maximum]], a [[local minimum]], or a [[saddle point]]. Derivative tests can also give information about the [[Concave function|concavity]] of a function.\n\nThe usefulness of derivatives to find extrema is proved mathematically by [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem of stationary points]].\n\n==First derivative test==\nThe first derivative test examines a function's [[monotonic function|monotonic]] properties (where the function is increasing or decreasing) focusing on a particular point in its domain. If the function \"switches\" from increasing to decreasing at the point, then the function will achieve a highest value at that point. Similarly, if the function \"switches\" from decreasing to increasing at the point, then it will achieve a least value at that point. If the function fails to \"switch\", and remains increasing or remains decreasing, then no highest or least value is achieved.\n\nOne can examine a function's monotonicity without calculus. However, calculus is usually helpful because there are [[necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient conditions]] that guarantee the monotonicity properties above, and these conditions apply to the vast majority of functions one would encounter.\n\n===Precise statement of monotonicity properties===\n\nStated precisely, suppose ''f'' is a [[Continuous function|continuous]] real-valued function of a real variable, defined on some interval containing the point ''x''.\n\n*If there exists a positive number ''r>0'' such that ''f'' is weakly increasing on (''x'' \u2212 ''r'', ''x''] and weakly decreasing on [''x'', ''x'' + ''r''), then ''f'' has a local maximum at ''x''. This statement also works the other way around, if ''x'' is a local maximum point, then ''f'' is weakly increasing on (''x - r, x''] and weakly decreasing on [''x, x + r'').\n*If there exists a positive number ''r>0'' such that ''f'' is strictly increasing on (''x'' \u2212 ''r'', ''x''] and strictly increasing on [''x'', ''x'' + ''r''), then ''f'' is strictly increasing on (''x'' \u2212 ''r'', ''x'' + ''r'') and does not have a local maximum or minimum at ''x''.\n\nThis statement is a direct consequence of how [[local extrema]] are defined. That is, if ''x<sub>0</sub>'' is a local maximum point then there exists ''r>0'' such that ''f(x) \u2264 f(x<sub>0</sub>)'' for ''x'' in (''x - r, x + r'') which means ''f'' has to increase from ''x - r'' to ''x'' and has to decrease from ''x'' to ''x + r'' because ''f'' is continuous. \n\nNote that in the first two cases, ''f'' is not required to be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing to the left or right of ''x'', while in the last two cases, ''f'' is required to be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. The reason is that in the definition of local maximum and minimum, the inequality is not required to be strict: e.g. every value of a constant function is considered both a local maximum and a local minimum.\n\n===Precise statement of first derivative test===\n\nThe first derivative test depends on the \"increasing-decreasing test\", which is itself ultimately a consequence of the [[mean value theorem]]. It is a direct consequence of the way the [[derivative]] is defined and its connection to decrease and increase of a function locally, combined with the previous section.\n\nSuppose ''f'' is a real-valued function of a real variable defined on some interval containing the critical point ''a''. Further suppose that ''f'' is [[continuous function|continuous]] at ''a'' and [[differentiable function|differentiable]] on some open interval containing ''a'', except possibly at ''a'' itself.\n\n*If there exists a positive number ''r>0'' such that for every ''x'' in (''a'' \u2212 ''r'', ''a'') we have {{nobr|''{{\u2032|f}}''(''x'') \u2265 0,}} and for every ''x'' in (''a'', ''a'' + ''r'') we have {{nobr|''{{\u2032|f}}''(''x'') \u2264 0,}} then ''f'' has a local maximum at ''a''.\n*If there exists a positive number ''r>0'' such that for every ''x'' in (''a'' \u2212 ''r'', ''a'') \u222a (''a'', ''a'' + ''r'') we have {{nobr|''{{\u2032|f}}''(''x'') > 0,}} then ''f'' is strictly increasing at ''a'' and has neither a local maximum nor a local minimum there.\n*If none of the above conditions hold, then the test fails. (Such a condition is not [[vacuous truth|vacuous]]; there are functions that satisfy none of the first three conditions such as ''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup>\u22c5sin(1/''x'').\n\nAgain, corresponding to the comments in the section on monotonicity properties, note that in the first two cases, the inequality is not required to be strict, while in the next two, strict inequality is required.\n\n===Applications===\n\nThe first derivative test is helpful in solving [[optimization problem]]s in physics, economics, and engineering. In conjunction with the [[extreme value theorem]], it can be used to find the absolute maximum and minimum of a real-valued function defined on a closed, bounded interval. In conjunction with other information such as concavity, inflection points, and asymptotes, it can be used to sketch the graph of a function.\n\n==Second-derivative test (single variable)==\nAfter establishing the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of a function, the ''second-derivative test'' uses the value of the [[second derivative]] at those points to determine whether such points are a local [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] or a local [[Maxima and minima|minimum]]. If the function ''f'' is twice [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] at a critical point ''x'' (i.e. ''{{prime|f}}(x) = 0''), then:\n* If <math>f''(x) < 0</math>, then <math>f</math> has a local maximum at <math>x</math>.\n* If <math>f''(x) > 0</math>, then <math>f</math> has a local minimum at <math>x</math>.\n* If <math>f''(x) = 0</math>, the test is inconclusive.\n\nIn the last case, [[Taylor's theorem#Taylor's theorem in one real variable|Taylor's Theorem]] may be used to determine the behavior of ''f'' near ''x'' using [[higher derivative]]s.\n\n===Proof of the second-derivative test===\nSuppose we have <math>f''(x) > 0</math> (the proof for <math>f''(x) < 0</math> is analogous). By assumption, <math>f'(x) = 0</math>. Then\n\n: <math>0 < f''(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x + h) - f'(x)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x + h) - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x + h)}{h}.</math>\n\nThus, for ''h'' sufficiently small we get\n\n: <math>\\frac{f'(x + h)}{h} > 0,</math>\n\nwhich means that <math>f'(x + h) < 0</math> if <math>h < 0</math> (intuitively, ''f'' is decreasing as it approaches <math>x</math> from the left), and that <math>f'(x + h) > 0</math> if <math>h > 0</math> (intuitively, ''f'' is increasing as we go right from ''x''). Now, by the [[first-derivative test]], <math>f</math> has a local minimum at <math>x</math>.\n\n=== Concavity test ===\n\nA related but distinct use of second derivatives is to determine whether a function is [[Concave function|concave up]] or [[Concave function|concave down]] at a point. It does not, however, provide information about [[inflection points]]. Specifically, a twice-differentiable function ''f'' is concave up if <math>f''(x) > 0</math> and concave down if <math>f''(x) < 0</math>. Note that if <math>f(x) = x^4</math>, then <math>x = 0</math> has zero second derivative, yet is not an inflection point, so the second derivative alone does not give enough information to determine whether a given point is an inflection point.\n\n===Higher-order derivative test===\nThe ''higher-order derivative test'' or ''general derivative test'' is able to determine whether a function's critical points are maxima, minima, or points of inflection for a wider variety of functions than the second-order derivative test. As shown below, the second-derivative test is mathematically identical to the special case of ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 in the higher-order derivative test.\n\nLet ''f'' be a real-valued, sufficiently [[differentiable function]] on the interval <math>I \\subset \\R,\\ c \\in I</math>, and <math>n \\ge 1</math> an integer. Also let all the derivatives of ''f'' at ''c'' be zero up to and including the ''n''-th derivative, but with the (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-th derivative being non-zero:\n\n: <math>f'(c) = \\cdots =f^{(n)}(c) = 0\\quad \\text{and}\\quad f^{(n+1)}(c) \\ne 0.</math>\n\nThere are four possibilities, the first two cases where ''c'' is an extremum, the second two where ''c'' is a (local) saddle point:\n* If ''n'' is odd and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c) < 0</math>, then ''c'' is a local maximum.\n* If ''n'' is odd and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c) > 0</math>, then ''c'' is a local minimum.\n* If ''n'' is even and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c) < 0</math>, then ''c'' is a strictly decreasing point of inflection.\n* If ''n'' is even and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c) > 0</math>, then ''c'' is a strictly increasing point of inflection.\n\nSince ''n'' must be either odd or even, this analytical test classifies any stationary point of ''f'', so long as a nonzero derivative shows up eventually.\n\n===Example===\nSay, we want to perform the general derivative test on the function <math>f(x) = x^6 + 5</math> at the point <math>x = 0</math>. To do this, we calculate the derivatives of the function and then evaluate them at the point of interest until the result is nonzero.\n\n: <math>f'(x) = 6x^5</math>, <math>f'(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f''(x) = 30x^4</math>, <math>f''(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f^{(3)}(x) = 120x^3</math>, <math>f^{(3)}(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f^{(4)}(x) = 360x^2</math>, <math>f^{(4)}(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f^{(5)}(x) = 720x</math>, <math>f^{(5)}(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f^{(6)}(x) = 720</math>, <math>f^{(6)}(0) = 720.</math>\n\nAs shown above, at the point <math>x = 0</math>, the function <math>x^6 + 5</math> has all of its derivatives at 0 equal to 0, except for the 6th derivative, which is positive. Thus ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5, and by the test, there is a local minimum at 0.\n\n== Multivariable case ==\n{{main article|Second partial derivative test}}\nFor a function of more than one variable, the second derivative test generalizes to a test based on the [[eigenvalue]]s of the function's [[Hessian matrix]] at the critical point. In particular, assuming that all second order partial derivatives of ''f'' are continuous on a neighbourhood of a critical point ''x'', then if the eigenvalues of the Hessian at ''x'' are all positive, then ''x'' is a local minimum.  If the eigenvalues are all negative, then ''x'' is a local maximum, and if some are positive and some negative, then the point is a [[saddle point]].

Derivative tests can also give information about the [[Concave function|concavity]] of a function.\n\nThe usefulness of derivatives to find extrema is proved mathematically by [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem of stationary points]].\n\n==First derivative test==\nThe first derivative test examines a function's [[monotonic function|monotonic]] properties (where the function is increasing or decreasing) focusing on a particular point in its domain. If the function \"switches\" from increasing to decreasing at the point, then the function will achieve a highest value at that point. Similarly, if the function \"switches\" from decreasing to increasing at the point, then it will achieve a least value at that point. If the function fails to \"switch\", and remains increasing or remains decreasing, then no highest or least value is achieved.\n\nOne can examine a function's monotonicity without calculus. However, calculus is usually helpful because there are [[necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient conditions]] that guarantee the monotonicity properties above, and these conditions apply to the vast majority of functions one would encounter.\n\n===Precise statement of monotonicity properties===\n\nStated precisely, suppose ''f'' is a [[Continuous function|continuous]] real-valued function of a real variable, defined on some interval containing the point ''x''.\n\n*If there exists a positive number ''r>0'' such that ''f'' is weakly increasing on (''x'' \u2212 ''r'', ''x''] and weakly decreasing on [''x'', ''x'' + ''r''), then ''f'' has a local maximum at ''x''. This statement also works the other way around, if ''x'' is a local maximum point, then ''f'' is weakly increasing on (''x - r, x''] and weakly decreasing on [''x, x + r'').\n*If there exists a positive number ''r>0'' such that ''f'' is strictly increasing on (''x'' \u2212 ''r'', ''x''] and strictly increasing on [''x'', ''x'' + ''r''), then ''f'' is strictly increasing on (''x'' \u2212 ''r'', ''x'' + ''r'') and does not have a local maximum or minimum at ''x''.\n\nThis statement is a direct consequence of how [[local extrema]] are defined. That is, if ''x<sub>0</sub>'' is a local maximum point then there exists ''r>0'' such that ''f(x) \u2264 f(x<sub>0</sub>)'' for ''x'' in (''x - r, x + r'') which means ''f'' has to increase from ''x - r'' to ''x'' and has to decrease from ''x'' to ''x + r'' because ''f'' is continuous. \n\nNote that in the first two cases, ''f'' is not required to be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing to the left or right of ''x'', while in the last two cases, ''f'' is required to be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. The reason is that in the definition of local maximum and minimum, the inequality is not required to be strict: e.g. every value of a constant function is considered both a local maximum and a local minimum.\n\n===Precise statement of first derivative test===\n\nThe first derivative test depends on the \"increasing-decreasing test\", which is itself ultimately a consequence of the [[mean value theorem]]. It is a direct consequence of the way the [[derivative]] is defined and its connection to decrease and increase of a function locally, combined with the previous section.\n\nSuppose ''f'' is a real-valued function of a real variable defined on some interval containing the critical point ''a''. Further suppose that ''f'' is [[continuous function|continuous]] at ''a'' and [[differentiable function|differentiable]] on some open interval containing ''a'', except possibly at ''a'' itself.\n\n*If there exists a positive number ''r>0'' such that for every ''x'' in (''a'' \u2212 ''r'', ''a'') we have {{nobr|''{{\u2032|f}}''(''x'') \u2265 0,}} and for every ''x'' in (''a'', ''a'' + ''r'') we have {{nobr|''{{\u2032|f}}''(''x'') \u2264 0,}} then ''f'' has a local maximum at ''a''.\n*If there exists a positive number ''r>0'' such that for every ''x'' in (''a'' \u2212 ''r'', ''a'') \u222a (''a'', ''a'' + ''r'') we have {{nobr|''{{\u2032|f}}''(''x'') > 0,}} then ''f'' is strictly increasing at ''a'' and has neither a local maximum nor a local minimum there.\n*If none of the above conditions hold, then the test fails. (Such a condition is not [[vacuous truth|vacuous]]; there are functions that satisfy none of the first three conditions such as ''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup>\u22c5sin(1/''x'').\n\nAgain, corresponding to the comments in the section on monotonicity properties, note that in the first two cases, the inequality is not required to be strict, while in the next two, strict inequality is required.\n\n===Applications===\n\nThe first derivative test is helpful in solving [[optimization problem]]s in physics, economics, and engineering. In conjunction with the [[extreme value theorem]], it can be used to find the absolute maximum and minimum of a real-valued function defined on a closed, bounded interval. In conjunction with other information such as concavity, inflection points, and asymptotes, it can be used to sketch the graph of a function.\n\n==Second derivative test (single variable)==\nAfter establishing the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of a function, the ''second derivative test'' uses the value of the [[second derivative]] at those points to determine whether such points are a local [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] or a local [[Maxima and minima|minimum]]. If the function ''f'' is twice [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] at a critical point ''x'' (i.e. ''{{prime|f}}(x) = 0''), then:\n\n* If <math>\\ f^{\\prime\\prime}(x) < 0</math> then <math>f</math> has a local maximum at <math>x</math>.\n* If <math>\\ f^{\\prime\\prime}(x) > 0</math> then <math>f</math> has a local minimum at <math>x</math>.\n* If <math>\\ f^{\\prime\\prime}(x) = 0</math>, the test is inconclusive.\n\nIn the last case, [[Taylor's theorem#Taylor's theorem in one real variable|Taylor's Theorem]] may be used to determine the behavior of ''f'' near ''x'' using [[higher derivative]]s.\n\n===Proof of the second derivative test===\nSuppose we have <math>f''(x) > 0</math> (the proof for <math>f''(x) < 0</math> is analogous). By assumption, <math>f'(x) = 0</math>. Then\n\n:<math>0 < f''(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x + h) - f'(x)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x + h) - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x+h)}{h}.</math>\n\nThus, for ''h'' sufficiently small we get\n\n:<math>\\frac{f'(x+h)}{h} > 0</math>\nwhich means that\n<math>f'(x+h) < 0</math> if <math>h<0</math> (intuitively, f is decreasing as it approaches <math>x</math> from the left), and that <math>f'(x+h) > 0</math> if <math>h > 0</math> (intuitively, f is increasing as we go right from ''x''). Now, by the [[first derivative test]], <math>f</math> has a local minimum at <math>x</math>.\n\n=== Concavity test ===\n\nA related but distinct use of second derivatives is to determine whether a function is [[Concave function|concave up]] or [[Concave function|concave down]] at a point. It does not, however, provide information about [[inflection points]]. Specifically, a twice-differentiable function ''f'' is concave up if <math>f''(x) > 0</math> and concave down if <math>f''(x) < 0</math>. Note that if <math>f(x) = x^4</math>, then <math>x=0</math> has zero second derivative, yet is not an inflection point, so the second derivative alone does not give enough information to determine if a given point is an inflection point.\n\n===Higher-order derivative test===\nThe ''higher-order derivative test'' or ''general derivative test'' is able to determine whether a function's critical points are maxima, minima, or points of inflection for a wider variety of functions than the second-order derivative test. As shown below, the second derivative test is mathematically identical to the special case of n=1 in the higher-order derivative test.\n\nLet ''f'' be a real-valued, sufficiently [[differentiable function]] on the interval <math>I \\subset \\R, \\; c \\in I</math> and <math>n \\ge 1</math> an integer. Also let all the derivatives of ''f'' at ''c'' be zero up to and including the ''n''th derivative, but with the (''n''+1)th derivative being non-zero:\n\n<math>f'(c)=\\cdots=f^{(n)}(c)=0\\quad \\text{and}\\quad f^{(n+1)}(c)\\,\\not= 0</math>.\n\nThere are four possibilities, the first two cases where ''c'' is an extremum, the second two where c is a (local) saddle point:\n* If ''n'' is odd and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c)<0</math>, then ''c'' is a local maximum.\n* If ''n'' is odd and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c)>0</math>, then ''c'' is a local minimum.\n* If ''n'' is even and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c)<0</math>, then ''c'' is a strictly decreasing point of inflection.\n* If ''n'' is even and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c)>0</math>, then ''c'' is a strictly increasing point of inflection.\n\nSince ''n'' must be either odd or even, this analytical test classifies any stationary point of ''f'', so long as a nonzero derivative shows up eventually.\n\n===Example===\nSay we want to perform the general derivative test on the function <math>f(x)=x^6+5</math> at the point <math>x=0</math>. To do this, we calculate the derivatives of the function and then evaluate them at the point of interest until the result is nonzero.\n\n:<math>f'(x)=6x^5</math>, <math>f'(0)=0</math>\n\n:<math>f''(x)=30x^4</math>, <math>f''(0)=0</math>\n\n:<math>f^{(3)}(x)=120x^3</math>, <math>f^{(3)}(0)=0</math>\n\n:<math>f^{(4)}(x)=360x^2</math>, <math>f^{(4)}(0)=0</math>\n\n:<math>f^{(5)}(x)=720x</math>, <math>f^{(5)}(0)=0</math>\n\n:<math>f^{(6)}(x)=720</math>, <math>f^{(6)}(0)=720</math>\n\nAs shown above, at the point <math>x=0</math>, the function <math>x^6+5</math> has all of its derivatives at 0 equal to 0 except for the 6th derivative, which is positive. Thus n=5, and by the test, there is a local minimum at 0.\n\n== Multivariable case ==\n{{main article|Second partial derivative test}}\nFor a function of more than one variable, the second derivative test generalizes to a test based on the [[eigenvalue]]s of the function's [[Hessian matrix]] at the critical point. In particular, assuming that all second order partial derivatives of ''f'' are continuous on a neighbourhood of a critical point ''x'', then if the eigenvalues of the Hessian at ''x'' are all positive, then ''x'' is a local minimum.  If the eigenvalues are all negative, then ''x'' is a local maximum, and if some are positive and some negative, then the point is a [[saddle point]].  If the Hessian matrix is [[singular matrix|singular]], then the second derivative test is inconclusive.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)]]\n* [[Maxima and minima]]\n* [[Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions]]\n* [[Phase line (mathematics)|Phase line]] \u2013 virtually identical diagram, used in the study of ordinary differential equations\n* [[Hessian matrix#Bordered Hessian|Bordered Hessian]]\n* [[Optimization (mathematics)]]\n* [[Differentiability]]\n* [[Convex function]]\n* [[Second partial derivative test]]\n* [[Saddle point]]\n* [[Inflection point]]\n* [[Stationary point]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |first=Alpha C. |last=Chiang |authorlink=Alpha Chiang |title=Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics |url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalmetho0000chia_h4v2 |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=Third |year=1984 |isbn=0-07-010813-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalmetho0000chia_h4v2/page/231 231\u2013267] }}\n*{{cite book |first=Jerrold |last=Marsden |authorlink=Jerrold E.

With financial support from Saudi Arabia, Deobandi madrasas were part of this vast proliferation in religious education, much of it located in Afghan refugee camps that sprang up in the 1980s. This rapid expansion came at the expense of doctrinal coherence as there were not enough qualified teachers to staff all the new schools.
