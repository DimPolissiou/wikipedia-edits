If receiving any particular piece of mail does not affect the arrival times of future pieces of mail, i.e., if pieces of mail from a wide range of sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number of pieces of mail received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution.{{r|Brooks2007}} Other examples that may follow a Poisson distribution include the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour and the number of decay events per second from a radioactive source.\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n===Probability mass function===\n\nThe Poisson distribution is popular for modeling the ''number of times an event occurs in an interval of time or space''.\n\nA discrete [[random variable]] ''X'' is said to have a Poisson distribution with parameter ''\u03bb''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, if, for ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;..., the [[probability mass function]] of ''X'' is given by:{{r|Yates2014|p=60}}\n:<math>\\!f(k; \\lambda)= \\Pr(X = k)= \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!},</math>\nwhere\n* ''e'' is [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]] (''e'' = 2.71828...)\n* ''k''! is the [[factorial]] of ''k''.\n\nThe positive [[real number]] ''\u03bb'' is equal to the [[expected value]] of ''X'' and also to its [[variance]]<ref>For the proof, see :\n[http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Expectation_of_Poisson_Distribution Proof wiki: expectation] and [http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Variance_of_Poisson_Distribution Proof wiki: variance]</ref>\n:<math>\\lambda=\\operatorname{E}(X)=\\operatorname{Var}(X).</math>\n\nThe Poisson distribution can be applied to systems with a [[large number of rare events|large number of possible events, each of which is rare]]. The number of such events that occur during a fixed time interval is, under the right circumstances, a random number with a Poisson distribution.\n\n===Example===\nThe Poisson distribution may be useful to model events such as\n* The number of meteorites greater than 1 meter diameter that strike Earth in a year\n* The number of patients arriving in an emergency room between 10 and 11 pm\n* The number of laser photons hitting a detector in a particular time interval\n\n===Assumptions and validity===\nThe Poisson distribution is an appropriate model if the following assumptions are true:{{r|Koehrsen2019}}\n* {{mvar|k}} is the number of times an event occurs in an interval and {{mvar|k}} can take values 0, 1, 2, ....\n* The occurrence of one event does not affect the probability that a second event will occur. That is, events occur independently.\n* The average rate at which events occur is independent of any occurrences. For simplicity, this is usually assumed to be constant, but may in practice vary with time.\n* Two events cannot occur at exactly the same instant; instead, at each very small sub-interval exactly one event either occurs or does not occur.\n\nIf these conditions are true, then {{mvar|k}} is a Poisson random variable, and the distribution of {{mvar|k}} is a Poisson distribution.\n\nThe Poisson distribution is also the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a [[binomial distribution]], for which the probability of success for each trial equals {{mvar|\u03bb}} divided by the number of trials, as the number of trials approaches infinity (see [[Poisson distribution#Related distributions|Related distributions]]).\n\n===Probability of events for a Poisson distribution===\nAn event can occur 0, 1, 2, ... times in an interval. The average number of events in an interval is designated <math> \\lambda </math> (lambda). <math> \\lambda </math> is the event rate, also called the rate parameter. The probability of observing {{mvar|k}} events in an interval is given by the equation\n\n:<math>P(k \\text{ events in interval}) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}</math>\n\nwhere\n* <math> \\lambda </math> is the average number of events per interval\n* ''e'' is the number 2.71828... ([[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]]) the base of the natural logarithms\n* {{mvar|k}} takes values 0, 1, 2, ...\n* {{mvar|k}}! = {{mvar|k}} \u00d7 ({{mvar|k}} \u2212 1) \u00d7 ({{mvar|k}} \u2212 2) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 is the [[factorial]] of {{mvar|k}}.\nThis equation is the [[probability mass function]] (PMF) for a Poisson distribution.\n\nThis equation can be adapted if, instead of the average number of events <math> \\lambda </math>, we are given a time rate <math> r </math> for the events to happen. Then <math> \\lambda = r t </math> (with <math> r</math> in units of 1/time), and\n\n: <math>P(k \\text{ events in interval } t) = \\frac{(r t)^k e^{-r t}}{k!}</math>\n\n==== Examples of probability for Poisson distributions ====\n\n{{col-begin|gap=5em}}\n{{col-break}}\nOn a particular river, overflow floods occur once every 100 years on average.

What is the probability of {{mvar|k}} = 0 meteorite hits in the next 100 years?\n\n: <math> P(k = \\text{0 meteorites hit in next 100 years}) = \\frac{1^0 e^{-1}}{0!} = \\frac{1}{e} \\approx 0.37 </math>\n\nUnder these assumptions, the probability that no large meteorites hit the earth in the next 100 years is roughly 0.37. The remaining 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;0.37&nbsp;= 0.63 is the probability of 1, 2, 3, or more large meteorite hits in the next 100 years.\nIn an example above, an overflow flood occurred once every 100 years (''\u03bb''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1). The probability of no overflow floods in 100 years was roughly 0.37, by the same calculation.\n\nIn general, if an event occurs on average once per interval (''\u03bb''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1), and the events follow a Poisson distribution, then {{nowrap|1=''P''(0 events in next interval)&nbsp;= 0.37}}. In addition, ''P''(exactly one event in next interval) = 0.37, as shown in the table for overflow floods.\n\n=== Examples that violate the Poisson assumptions ===\n\nThe number of students who arrive at the [[Student center|student union]] per minute will likely not follow a Poisson distribution, because the rate is not constant (low rate during class time, high rate between class times) and the arrivals of individual students are not independent (students tend to come in groups).\n\nThe number of magnitude 5 earthquakes per year in a country may not follow a Poisson distribution if one large earthquake increases the probability of aftershocks of similar magnitude.\n\nAmong patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital, the number of days that the patients spend in the ICU is not Poisson distributed because the number of days cannot be zero.

Therefore, the maximum likelihood estimate is an [[unbiased estimator]] of \u03bb. It is also an efficient estimator, i.e. its estimation variance achieves the [[Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound]] (CRLB).{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Hence it is [[Minimum-variance unbiased estimator|minimum-variance unbiased]]. Also it can be proven that the sum (and hence the sample mean as it is a one-to-one function of the sum) is a complete and sufficient statistic for \u03bb.\n\nTo prove sufficiency we may use the [[Sufficient statistic|factorization theorem]]. Consider partitioning the probability mass function of the joint Poisson distribution for the sample into two parts: one that depends solely on the sample <math>\\mathbf{x}</math> (called <math>h(\\mathbf{x})</math>) and one that depends on the parameter <math>\\lambda</math> and the sample <math>\\mathbf{x}</math> only through the function <math>T(\\mathbf{x})</math>. Then <math>T(\\mathbf{x})</math> is a sufficient statistic for <math>\\lambda</math>.\n\n: <math> P(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{i=1}^n\\frac{\\lambda^{x_i} e^{-\\lambda}}{x_i!}=\\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i!} \\times \\lambda^{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}e^{-n\\lambda} </math>\n\nThe first term, <math>h(\\mathbf{x})</math>, depends only on <math>\\mathbf{x}</math>. The second term, <math>g(T(\\mathbf{x})|\\lambda)</math>, depends on the sample only through <math>T(\\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i</math>. Thus, <math>T(\\mathbf{x})</math> is sufficient.\n\nTo find the parameter \u03bb that maximizes the probability function for the Poisson population, we can use the logarithm of the likelihood function:\n\n: <math> \\begin{align} \\ell(\\lambda) & = \\ln \\prod_{i=1}^n f(k_i \\mid \\lambda) \\\\ & = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^{k_i}}{k_i!}\\right) \\\\ & = -n\\lambda + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i\\right) \\ln(\\lambda) - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln(k_i!). \\end{align} </math>\n\nWe take the derivative of ''<math>\\ell</math>'' with respect to ''\u03bb'' and compare it to zero:\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} \\ell(\\lambda) = 0 \\iff -n + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i\\right) \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = 0. \\!</math>\n\nSolving for ''\u03bb'' gives a stationary point.\n\n: <math> \\lambda = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i}{n}</math>\n\nSo ''\u03bb'' is the average of the ''k''<sub>''i''</sub> values. Obtaining the sign of the second derivative of ''L'' at the stationary point will determine what kind of extreme value ''\u03bb'' is.\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\lambda^2} = -\\lambda^{-2}\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i </math>\n\nEvaluating the second derivative ''at the stationary point'' gives:\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\lambda^2} = - \\frac{n^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i} </math>\n\nwhich is the negative of ''n'' times the reciprocal of the average of the k<sub>i</sub>. This expression is negative when the average is positive. If this is satisfied, then the stationary point maximizes the probability function.\n\nFor [[Completeness (statistics)|completeness]], a family of distributions is said to be complete if and only if <math> E(g(T)) = 0</math>  implies that <math>P_\\lambda(g(T) = 0) = 1</math> for all <math>\\lambda</math>. If the individual <math>X_i</math> are iid <math>\\mathrm{Po}(\\lambda)</math>, then <math>T(\\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\\sim \\mathrm{Po}(n\\lambda)</math>. Knowing the distribution we want to investigate, it is easy to see that the statistic is complete.\n\n: <math>E(g(T))=\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty g(t)\\frac{(n\\lambda)^te^{-n\\lambda}}{t!}=0</math>\n\nFor this equality to hold, <math>g(t)</math> must be 0. This follows from the fact that none of the other terms will be 0 for all <math>t</math> in the sum and for all possible values of <math>\\lambda</math>.

The chi-squared distribution is itself closely related to the [[gamma distribution]], and this leads to an alternative expression.

This is a major vulnerability to most [[Quantum key distribution]] protocols known as Photon Number Splitting (PNS).\n\nThe Poisson distribution arises in connection with Poisson processes. It applies to various phenomena of discrete properties (that is, those that may happen 0, 1, 2, 3, ... times during a given period of time or in a given area) whenever the probability of the phenomenon happening is constant in time or [[space]].

All distributions have a mean of&nbsp;5. The horizontal axis shows the number of events&nbsp;''k''. As ''n'' gets larger, the Poisson distribution becomes an increasingly better approximation for the binomial distribution with the same mean.]]\n\nThe rate of an event is related to the probability of an event occurring in some small subinterval (of time, space or otherwise). In the case of the Poisson distribution, one assumes that there exists a small enough subinterval for which the probability of an event occurring twice is \"negligible\". With this assumption one can derive the Poisson distribution from the Binomial one, given only the information of expected number of total events in the whole interval. Let this total number be <math>\\lambda</math>. Divide the whole interval into <math>n</math> subintervals <math>I_1,\\dots,I_n</math> of equal size, such that <math>n</math> > <math>\\lambda</math> (since we are interested in only very small portions of the interval this assumption is meaningful). This means that the expected number of events in an interval <math>I_i</math> for each <math>i</math> is equal to <math>\\lambda/n</math>. Now we assume that the occurrence of an event in the whole interval can be seen as a [[Bernoulli trial]], where the <math>i^{th}</math> trial corresponds to looking whether an event happens at the subinterval <math>I_i</math> with probability <math>\\lambda/n</math>. The expected number of total events in <math>n</math> such trials would be <math>\\lambda</math>, the expected number of total events in the whole interval. Hence for each subdivision of the interval we have approximated the occurrence of the event as a Bernoulli process of the form <math>\\textrm{B}(n,\\lambda/n)</math>. As we have noted before we want to consider only very small subintervals. Therefore, we take the limit as <math>n</math> goes to infinity.\nIn this case the binomial distribution converges to what is known as the Poisson distribution by the [[Poisson limit theorem]].\n\nIn several of the above examples\u2014such as, the number of mutations in a given sequence of DNA\u2014the events being counted are actually the outcomes of discrete trials, and would more precisely be modelled using the [[binomial distribution]], that is\n\n:<math>X \\sim \\textrm{B}(n,p). \\,</math>\n\nIn such cases ''n'' is very large and ''p'' is very small (and so the expectation ''np'' is of intermediate magnitude). Then the distribution may be approximated by the less cumbersome Poisson distribution{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n:<math>X \\sim \\textrm{Pois}(np). \\,</math>\n\nThis approximation is sometimes known as the ''law of rare events'',{{r|Cameron1998|p=5}}since each of the ''n'' individual [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli events]] rarely occurs. The name may be misleading because the total count of success events in a Poisson process need not be rare if the parameter ''np'' is not small. For example, the number of telephone calls to a busy switchboard in one hour follows a Poisson distribution with the events appearing frequent to the operator, but they are rare from the point of view of the average member of the population who is very unlikely to make a call to that switchboard in that hour.\n\nThe word ''law'' is sometimes used as a synonym of [[probability distribution]], and ''convergence in law'' means ''convergence in distribution''. Accordingly, the Poisson distribution is sometimes called the \"law of small numbers\" because it is the probability distribution of the number of occurrences of an event that happens rarely but has very many opportunities to happen. ''The Law of Small Numbers'' is a book by Ladislaus Bortkiewicz about the Poisson distribution, published in 1898.{{r|vonBortkiewitsch1898}}{{r|Edgeworth1913}}\n\n=== Poisson point process ===\n\n{{Main|Poisson point process}}\n\nThe Poisson distribution arises as the number of points of a [[Poisson point process]] located in some finite region. More specifically, if ''D'' is some region space, for example Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>''d''</sup>, for which |''D''|, the area, volume or, more generally, the Lebesgue measure of the region is finite, and if {{nowrap|''N''(''D'')}} denotes the number of points in ''D'', then\n\n: <math> P(N(D)=k)=\\frac{(\\lambda|D|)^k e^{-\\lambda|D|}}{k!} .</math>\n\n=== Poisson regression and negative binomial regression ===\n\n[[Poisson regression]] and negative binomial regression are useful for analyses where the dependent (response) variable is the count (0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...) of the number of events or occurrences in an interval.\n\n=== Other applications in science ===\n\nIn a Poisson process, the number of observed occurrences fluctuates about its mean ''\u03bb'' with a [[standard deviation]] <math>\\sigma_k =\\sqrt{\\lambda}</math>. These fluctuations are denoted as ''Poisson noise'' or (particularly in electronics) as ''[[shot noise]]''.\n\nThe correlation of the mean and standard deviation in counting independent discrete occurrences is useful scientifically. By monitoring how the fluctuations vary with the mean signal, one can estimate the contribution of a single occurrence, ''even if that contribution is too small to be detected directly''. For example, the charge ''e'' on an electron can be estimated by correlating the magnitude of an [[electric current]] with its [[shot noise]]. If ''N'' electrons pass a point in a given time ''t'' on the average, the [[mean]] [[Electric current|current]] is <math>I=eN/t</math>; since the current fluctuations should be of the order <math>\\sigma_I=e\\sqrt{N}/t</math> (i.e., the standard deviation of the [[Poisson process]]), the charge <math>e</math> can be estimated from the ratio <math>t\\sigma_I^2/I</math>.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nAn everyday example is the graininess that appears as photographs are enlarged; the graininess is due to Poisson fluctuations in the number of reduced [[silver]] grains, not to the individual grains themselves. By [[Correlation|correlating]] the graininess with the degree of enlargement, one can estimate the contribution of an individual grain (which is otherwise too small to be seen unaided).{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Many other molecular applications of Poisson noise have been developed, e.g., estimating the number density of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] molecules in a [[cell membrane]].\n: <math>\n    \\Pr(N_t=k) = f(k;\\lambda t) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^k e^{-\\lambda t}}{k!}.</math>\n\nIn [[Causal Set]] theory the discrete elements of spacetime follow a Poisson distribution in the volume.\n\n==Computational methods==\n\nThe Poisson distribution poses two different tasks for dedicated software libraries: ''Evaluating'' the distribution <math>P(k;\\lambda)</math>, and ''drawing random numbers'' according to that distribution.\n\n=== Evaluating the Poisson distribution ===\nComputing <math>P(k;\\lambda)</math> for given <math>k</math> and <math>\\lambda</math> is a trivial task that can be accomplished by using the standard definition of <math>P(k;\\lambda)</math> in terms of exponential, power, and factorial functions. However, the conventional definition of the Poisson distribution contains two terms that can easily overflow on computers: \u03bb<sup>''k''</sup> and ''k''!. The fraction of \u03bb<sup>''k''</sup> to ''k''! can also produce a rounding error that is very large compared to ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03bb</sup>, and therefore give an erroneous result. For numerical stability the Poisson probability mass function should therefore be evaluated as\n:<math>\\!f(k; \\lambda)= \\exp \\left[ k\\ln \\lambda  - \\lambda  - \\ln \\Gamma (k+1) \\right],</math>\nwhich is mathematically equivalent but numerically stable.

If receiving any particular piece of mail does not affect the arrival times of future pieces of mail, i.e., if pieces of mail from a wide range of sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number of pieces of mail received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution.{{r|Brooks2007}} Other examples that may follow a Poisson distribution include the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour and the number of decay events per second from a radioactive source.\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n===Probability mass function===\n\nThe Poisson distribution is popular for modeling the ''number of times an event occurs in an interval of time or space''.\n\nA discrete [[random variable]] ''X{{space}}'' is said to have a Poisson distribution with parameter ''\u03bb''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, if, for ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;..., the [[probability mass function]] of ''X{{space}}'' is given by:{{r|Yates2014|p=60}}\n:<math>\\!f(k; \\lambda)= \\Pr(X = k)= \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!},</math>\nwhere\n* ''e'' is [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]] (''e'' = 2.71828...)\n* ''k''! is the [[factorial]] of ''k''.\n\nThe positive [[real number]] ''\u03bb'' is equal to the [[expected value]] of ''X'' and also to its [[variance]]<ref>For the proof, see :\n[http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Expectation_of_Poisson_Distribution Proof wiki: expectation] and [http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Variance_of_Poisson_Distribution Proof wiki: variance]</ref>\n:<math>\\lambda=\\operatorname{E}(X)=\\operatorname{Var}(X).</math>\n\nThe Poisson distribution can be applied to systems with a [[large number of rare events|large number of possible events, each of which is rare]]. The number of such events that occur during a fixed time interval is, under the right circumstances, a random number with a Poisson distribution.\n\n===Example===\nThe Poisson distribution may be useful to model events such as\n* The number of meteorites greater than 1 meter diameter that strike Earth in a year\n* The number of patients arriving in an emergency room between 10 and 11 pm\n* The number of laser photons hitting a detector in a particular time interval\n\n===Assumptions and validity===\nThe Poisson distribution is an appropriate model if the following assumptions are true:{{r|Koehrsen2019}}\n* {{mvar|k}} is the number of times an event occurs in an interval and {{mvar|k}} can take values 0, 1, 2, ....\n* The occurrence of one event does not affect the probability that a second event will occur. That is, events occur independently.\n* The average rate at which events occur is independent of any occurrences. For simplicity, this is usually assumed to be constant, but may in practice vary with time.\n* Two events cannot occur at exactly the same instant; instead, at each very small sub-interval exactly one event either occurs or does not occur.\n\nIf these conditions are true, then {{mvar|k}} is a Poisson random variable, and the distribution of {{mvar|k}} is a Poisson distribution.\n\nThe Poisson distribution is also the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a [[binomial distribution]], for which the probability of success for each trial equals {{mvar|\u03bb}} divided by the number of trials, as the number of trials approaches infinity (see [[Poisson distribution#Related distributions|Related distributions]]).\n\n===Probability of events for a Poisson distribution===\nAn event can occur 0, 1, 2, ... times in an interval. The average number of events in an interval is designated <math> \\lambda </math> (lambda). <math> \\lambda </math> is the event rate, also called the rate parameter.

The [[maximum likelihood]] estimate is <ref>{{cite web |last=Paszek|first=Ewa |title=Maximum Likelihood Estimation \u2013 Examples |url = http://cnx.org/content/m13500/latest/?collection=col10343/latest}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\widehat{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{MLE}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i. \\!</math>\n\nSince each observation has expectation \u03bb so does this sample mean. Therefore, the maximum likelihood estimate is an [[unbiased estimator]] of \u03bb. It is also an efficient estimator, i.e. its estimation variance achieves the [[Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound]] (CRLB).{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Hence it is [[Minimum-variance unbiased estimator|minimum-variance unbiased]]. Also it can be proven that the sum (and hence the sample mean as it is a one-to-one function of the sum) is a complete and sufficient statistic for \u03bb.\n\nTo prove sufficiency we may use the [[Sufficient statistic|factorization theorem]]. Consider partitioning the probability mass function of the joint Poisson distribution for the sample into two parts: one that depends solely on the sample <math>\\mathbf{x}</math> (called <math>h(\\mathbf{x})</math>) and one that depends on the parameter <math>\\lambda</math> and the sample <math>\\mathbf{x}</math> only through the function <math>T(\\mathbf{x})</math>. Then <math>T(\\mathbf{x})</math> is a sufficient statistic for <math>\\lambda</math>.\n\n: <math> P(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{i=1}^n\\frac{\\lambda^{x_i} e^{-\\lambda}}{x_i!}=\\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i!} \\times \\lambda^{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}e^{-n\\lambda} </math>\n\nThe first term, <math>h(\\mathbf{x})</math>, depends only on <math>\\mathbf{x}</math>. The second term, <math>g(T(\\mathbf{x})|\\lambda)</math>, depends on the sample only through <math>T(\\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i</math>. Thus, <math>T(\\mathbf{x})</math> is sufficient.\n\nTo find the parameter \u03bb that maximizes the probability function for the Poisson population, we can use the logarithm of the likelihood function:\n\n: <math> \\begin{align} \\ell(\\lambda) & = \\ln \\prod_{i=1}^n f(k_i \\mid \\lambda) \\\\ & = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^{k_i}}{k_i!}\\right) \\\\ & = -n\\lambda + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i\\right) \\ln(\\lambda) - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln(k_i!). \\end{align} </math>\n\nWe take the derivative of ''<math>\\ell</math>'' with respect to ''\u03bb'' and compare it to zero:\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} \\ell(\\lambda) = 0 \\iff -n + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i\\right) \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = 0. \\!</math>\n\nSolving for ''\u03bb'' gives a stationary point.\n\n: <math> \\lambda = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i}{n}</math>\n\nSo ''\u03bb'' is the average of the ''k''<sub>''i''</sub> values. Obtaining the sign of the second derivative of ''L'' at the stationary point will determine what kind of extreme value ''\u03bb'' is.\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\lambda^2} = -\\lambda^{-2}\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i </math>\n\nEvaluating the second derivative ''at the stationary point'' gives:\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\lambda^2} = - \\frac{n^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i} </math>\n\nwhich is the negative of ''n'' times the reciprocal of the average of the k<sub>i</sub>. This expression is negative when the average is positive. If this is satisfied, then the stationary point maximizes the probability function.\n\nFor [[Completeness (statistics)|completeness]], a family of distributions is said to be complete if and only if <math> E(g(T)) = 0</math>  implies that <math>P_\\lambda(g(T) = 0) = 1</math> for all <math>\\lambda</math>. If the individual <math>X_i</math> are iid <math>\\mathrm{Po}(\\lambda)</math>, then <math>T(\\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\\sim \\mathrm{Po}(n\\lambda)</math>. Knowing the distribution we want to investigate, it is easy to see that the statistic is complete.\n\n: <math>E(g(T))=\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty g(t)\\frac{(n\\lambda)^te^{-n\\lambda}}{t!}=0</math>\n\nFor this equality to hold, <math>g(t)</math> must be 0. This follows from the fact that none of the other terms will be 0 for all <math>t</math> in the sum and for all possible values of <math>\\lambda</math>. Hence, <math> E(g(T)) = 0</math> for all <math>\\lambda</math> implies that <math>P_\\lambda(g(T) = 0) = 1</math>, and the statistic has been shown to be complete.\n\n=== Confidence interval ===\nThe [[confidence interval]] for the mean of a Poisson distribution can be expressed using the relationship between the cumulative distribution functions of the Poisson and [[chi-squared distribution]]s. The chi-squared distribution is itself closely related to the [[gamma distribution]], and this leads to an alternative expression.

All distributions have a mean of&nbsp;5. The horizontal axis shows the number of events&nbsp;''k''. As ''n'' gets larger, the Poisson distribution becomes an increasingly better approximation for the binomial distribution with the same mean.]]\n\nThe rate of an event is related to the probability of an event occurring in some small subinterval (of time, space or otherwise). In the case of the Poisson distribution, one assumes that there exists a small enough subinterval for which the probability of an event occurring twice is \"negligible\". With this assumption one can derive the Poisson distribution from the Binomial one, given only the information of expected number of total events in the whole interval. Let this total number be <math>\\lambda</math>. Divide the whole interval into <math>n</math> subintervals <math>I_1,\\dots,I_n</math> of equal size, such that <math>n</math> > <math>\\lambda</math> (since we are interested in only very small portions of the interval this assumption is meaningful). This means that the expected number of events in an interval <math>I_i</math> for each <math>i</math> is equal to <math>\\lambda/n</math>. Now we assume that the occurrence of an event in the whole interval can be seen as a [[Bernoulli trial]], where the <math>i^{th}</math> trial corresponds to looking whether an event happens at the subinterval <math>I_i</math> with probability <math>\\lambda/n</math>. The expected number of total events in <math>n</math> such trials would be <math>\\lambda</math>, the expected number of total events in the whole interval. Hence for each subdivision of the interval we have approximated the occurrence of the event as a Bernoulli process of the form <math>\\textrm{B}(n,\\lambda/n)</math>. As we have noted before we want to consider only very small subintervals. Therefore, we take the limit as <math>n</math> goes to infinity.\nIn this case the binomial distribution converges to what is known as the Poisson distribution by the [[Poisson limit theorem]].\n\nIn several of the above examples\u2014such as, the number of mutations in a given sequence of DNA\u2014the events being counted are actually the outcomes of discrete trials, and would more precisely be modelled using the [[binomial distribution]], that is\n\n:<math>X \\sim \\textrm{B}(n,p). \\,</math>\n\nIn such cases ''n'' is very large and ''p'' is very small (and so the expectation ''np'' is of intermediate magnitude). Then the distribution may be approximated by the less cumbersome Poisson distribution{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n:<math>X \\sim \\textrm{Pois}(np). \\,</math>\n\nThis approximation is sometimes known as the ''law of rare events'',{{r|Cameron1998|p=5}}since each of the ''n'' individual [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli events]] rarely occurs. The name may be misleading because the total count of success events in a Poisson process need not be rare if the parameter ''np'' is not small. For example, the number of telephone calls to a busy switchboard in one hour follows a Poisson distribution with the events appearing frequent to the operator, but they are rare from the point of view of the average member of the population who is very unlikely to make a call to that switchboard in that hour.\n\nThe word ''law'' is sometimes used as a synonym of [[probability distribution]], and ''convergence in law'' means ''convergence in distribution''. Accordingly, the Poisson distribution is sometimes called the \"law of small numbers\" because it is the probability distribution of the number of occurrences of an event that happens rarely but has very many opportunities to happen. ''The Law of Small Numbers'' is a book by Ladislaus Bortkiewicz about the Poisson distribution, published in 1898.{{r|vonBortkiewitsch1898}}{{r|Edgeworth1913}}\n\n=== Poisson point process ===\n\n{{Main|Poisson point process}}\n\nThe Poisson distribution arises as the number of points of a [[Poisson point process]] located in some finite region.

These fluctuations are denoted as ''Poisson noise'' or (particularly in electronics) as ''[[shot noise]]''.\n\nThe correlation of the mean and standard deviation in counting independent discrete occurrences is useful scientifically. By monitoring how the fluctuations vary with the mean signal, one can estimate the contribution of a single occurrence, ''even if that contribution is too small to be detected directly''. For example, the charge ''e'' on an electron can be estimated by correlating the magnitude of an [[electric current]] with its [[shot noise]]. If ''N'' electrons pass a point in a given time ''t'' on the average, the [[mean]] [[Electric current|current]] is <math>I=eN/t</math>; since the current fluctuations should be of the order <math>\\sigma_I=e\\sqrt{N}/t</math> (i.e., the standard deviation of the [[Poisson process]]), the charge <math>e</math> can be estimated from the ratio <math>t\\sigma_I^2/I</math>.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nAn everyday example is the graininess that appears as photographs are enlarged; the graininess is due to Poisson fluctuations in the number of reduced [[silver]] grains, not to the individual grains themselves. By [[Correlation|correlating]] the graininess with the degree of enlargement, one can estimate the contribution of an individual grain (which is otherwise too small to be seen unaided).{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Many other molecular applications of Poisson noise have been developed, e.g., estimating the number density of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] molecules in a [[cell membrane]].\n: <math>\n    \\Pr(N_t=k) = f(k;\\lambda t) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^k e^{-\\lambda t}}{k!}.</math>\n\nIn [[Causal Set]] theory the discrete elements of spacetime follow a Poisson distribution in the volume.\n\n==Computational methods==\n\nThe Poisson distribution poses two different tasks for dedicated software libraries: ''Evaluating'' the distribution <math>P(k;\\lambda)</math>, and ''drawing random numbers'' according to that distribution.\n\n=== Evaluating the Poisson distribution ===\nComputing <math>P(k;\\lambda)</math> for given <math>k</math> and <math>\\lambda</math> is a trivial task that can be accomplished by using the standard definition of <math>P(k;\\lambda)</math> in terms of exponential, power, and factorial functions. However, the conventional definition of the Poisson distribution contains two terms that can easily overflow on computers: \u03bb<sup>''k''</sup> and ''k''!. The fraction of \u03bb<sup>''k''</sup> to ''k''! can also produce a rounding error that is very large compared to ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03bb</sup>, and therefore give an erroneous result. For numerical stability the Poisson probability mass function should therefore be evaluated as\n:<math>\\!f(k; \\lambda)= \\exp \\left[ k\\ln \\lambda  - \\lambda  - \\ln \\Gamma (k+1) \\right],</math>\nwhich is mathematically equivalent but numerically stable. The natural logarithm of the [[Gamma function]] can be obtained using the <code>lgamma</code> function in the [[C (programming language)]] standard library (C99 version) or [[R (programming language)]], the <code>gammaln</code> function in [[MATLAB]] or [[SciPy]], or the <code>log_gamma</code> function in [[Fortran]] 2008 and later.\n\nSome computing languages provide built-in functions to evaluate the Poisson distribution, namely\n* [[R (programming language)|R]]: function <code>dpois(x, lambda)</code>;\n* [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]: function <code>POISSON( x, mean, cumulative)</code>, with a flag to specify the cumulative distribution;\n* [[Mathematica]]: univariate Poisson distribution as <code>PoissonDistribution[<math>\\lambda</math>]</code>,<ref name=\"WLPoissonRefPage\">{{cite web |url = http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PoissonDistribution.html |title = Wolfram Language: PoissonDistribution reference page |website = wolfram.com |access-date = 2016-04-08 }}</ref> bivariate Poisson distribution as <code>MultivariatePoissonDistribution[<math>\\theta_{12}</math>,{ <math>\\theta_1 - \\theta_{12}</math>, <math>\\theta_2 - \\theta_{12}</math>}]</code>,.<ref name=\"WLMvPoissonRefPage\">{{cite web |url = http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MultivariatePoissonDistribution.html |title = Wolfram Language: MultivariatePoissonDistribution reference page |website = wolfram.com |access-date = 2016-04-08 }}</ref>\n\n=== Random drawing from the Poisson distribution ===\nThe less trivial task is to draw random integers from the Poisson distribution with given <math>\\lambda</math>.\n\nSolutions are provided by:\n* [[R (programming language)|R]]: function <code>rpois(n, lambda)</code>;\n* [[GNU Scientific Library]] (GSL): function [https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/randist.html#the-poisson-distribution gsl_ran_poisson]\n\n=== Generating Poisson-distributed random variables ===\n\nA simple algorithm to generate random Poisson-distributed numbers ([[pseudo-random number sampling]]) has been given by [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]]:{{r|Knuth1997|p=137-138}}\n\n '''algorithm''' ''poisson random number (Knuth)'':\n     '''init''':\n         '''Let''' L \u2190 ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03bb</sup>, k \u2190 0 and p \u2190 1.\n     '''do''':\n         k \u2190 k + 1.\n         Generate uniform random number u in [0,1] and '''let''' p \u2190 p \u00d7 u.\n     '''while''' p > L.\n     '''return''' k \u2212 1.\n\nThe complexity is linear in the returned value ''k'', which is \u03bb on average.

It was originally in the Blackburn building, a Georgian style building overlaid with [[art deco]]. The library space was an octagonal room which, while being architecturally beautiful, was insufficient to house the growing collection and student population.  Material was stored in the most unlikely places such as the staff tea room and anterooms to the lecture theatres. It was cold in winter and the smell from the adjacent animal facilities made opening the windows in summer an unattractive option.\nIn 1968, relief came in the form of the newly built Bosch building which served to extend the teaching and laboratory spaces of the Medical School. This building was built without pretension but is a good example of the utilitarian style of buildings built during the 1960s and 70s at Sydney University.\n\n==Nursing Library==\n\nThe old Bonds Factory, built on Mallett Street, Camperdown in 1917, is now the site of the [[Sydney Nursing School]]. Upstairs on the second floor, you will also find the Sydney University Nursing Library.\n\nThe space in the Nursing Library has been divided up by the shelves, creating a quiet study area that is isolated from the library computers and the lounge area. Behind the printer and photocopiers you will also find two bookable meeting rooms.\n\nThe library houses the collections for Nursing and Midwifery, however; you will also find some material on the social sciences and biology.\n\n==SciTech Library==\n[[File:SciTech Library Interior AUG2019.jpg|thumb|Inside the SciTech Library]]\nThe library is situated within the Jane Foss Russell building, second floor. This building sits at the junction between the Darlington and Camperdown campuses. The library was opened in 2008 following an international design competition.\n\n'''Interior'''\n\nThere are terraced areas dividing the study space and like an autumn forest, the book collection flows in lines of brown, green, red and orange, creating pockets of study areas between the shelves. Around the collection the meeting and training rooms hide behind walls of green glass.\nIn the open foyer which adjoins the information desks, exhibition and lounge areas. These overlook and open onto the terraced study areas, populated by private booths and group tables. There also are adaptable training rooms, more quiet study areas and meeting room. There is also a student kitchen.\n\n==Sydney College of the Arts Library==\n\nThe library space runs over two levels. Downstairs is where you will find the reference reading room, a student gallery, and the computer lab and associated printing and photocopying facilities. There are a couple of seminar rooms available on this level. What you will also find as you walk into the library is the multimedia collection featuring a collection of DVDs and CDs.\n\nUpstairs is where the majority of the collection sits. There are thousands of art theory titles, biographies and collections of artist\u2019s works that make up the bulk of SCA\u2019s research collection. There are spots for quiet study, a second seminar room and a room fitted out for watching DVDs from the collection.\n\n'''Building History'''\n\nThe Sydney College of the Arts is located off Balmain Road in [[Rozelle, New South Wales|Rozelle]] on what is known as the Kirkbride campus. Unlike the rest of the university which was purpose built as an educational institution, this historical site had a very different beginning.\nIt was originally called the [[Callan Park Hospital for the Insane]], and it was the State\u2019s solution to the abhorrent overcrowding and squalid conditions of the two existing asylums at [[Tarban Creek]] and [[Parramatta]]. Built in the 1880s, it operated as a mental health hospital right up to 1994. In 1996, the [[Sydney College of the Arts]] moved in and with it the SCA Library.\n\n== ThinkSpace ==\nThe ThinkSpace is a library owned and run location that is a technology showcase and creative play space, aimed at sparking ideas and providing opportunities for collaboration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.sydney.edu.au/libraries/library-facilities.html|title=University of Sydney Library|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Library facilities|publisher=University of Sydney|access-date=30 August 2016}}</ref> These technologies are supported by Peer Learning Advisers (PLAs) who guide, support and assist clients in using the ThinkSpace.

In 1989 it was formally recognised as an academic college of The University of Sydney. By then it had become \"the Cumberland College of Health Sciences\" and moved from the inner city to its current site at Lidcombe.\n\n==Herbert Smith Freehills Law Library==\n[[File:The interior of Law Library at the University of Sydney.png|thumb|The interior of the Herbert Smith Freehills Law Library at the University of Sydney showing its curved ceiling]]\n[[Herbert Smith Freehills]] Law Library opened in 2009 and is located on Eastern Avenue on the [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] campus, adjacent to [[Victoria Park, New South Wales|Victoria Park]] and is housed within the University of Sydney Law School building (F10)<ref name=Law /> The Law Library is a 24 hour space for University of Sydney students and staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.library.sydney.edu.au/fisher-and-law-libraries-go-247/|title=Fisher and Law Libraries go 24/7!|first=Gaith|last=Bader|date=23 June 2016|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Law library is spread over 5,000 sq metres of floor space and the collections supports the needs of the Law School. The library consists of a ground floor that contains the majority of the collections, staff area, information desk, printing/photocopying facilities and computer access. Upstairs on the mezzanine level are the research collections and 6 more group study rooms. All of these rooms are equipped with computers and can be [https://library.sydney.edu.au/libraries/room-booking.html booked online].\n\n==Bosch Commons==\nThe commons is situated in the Bosch building behind the Bosch lecture theatres on Western Avenue, Camperdown Campus.<ref name=\"University of Sydney Library\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.sydney.edu.au/libraries/locations.html|title=University of Sydney Library Locations & Opening hours|last=|first=|date=28 February 2016|website=|publisher=University of Sydney|access-date=30 August 2016}}</ref>  The Bosch Commons is now a student study and learning space, and is available 24/7 for University of Sydney students and staff.<ref name=\"University of Sydney Library\"/> The collection can be found at SciTech Library or in the HAL-3 book vending machine.\n\nInside you will find group discussion tables, quiet study areas, a meeting room, and a computer lab that doubles as a training room.\n\n'''History'''\n\nThe Medical library has a long history at the University, and it wasn't always in the Bosch building or as well resourced. It was originally in the Blackburn building, a Georgian style building overlaid with [[art deco]]. The library space was an octagonal room which, while being architecturally beautiful, was insufficient to house the growing collection and student population.  Material was stored in the most unlikely places such as the staff tea room and anterooms to the lecture theatres. It was cold in winter and the smell from the adjacent animal facilities made opening the windows in summer an unattractive option.\nIn 1968, relief came in the form of the newly built Bosch building which served to extend the teaching and laboratory spaces of the Medical School. This building was built without pretension but is a good example of the utilitarian style of buildings built during the 1960s and 70s at Sydney University.\n\n==Nursing Library==\n\nThe old Bonds Factory, built on Mallett Street, Camperdown in 1917, is now the site of the [[Sydney Nursing School]]. Upstairs on the second floor, you will also find the Sydney University Nursing Library.\n\nThe space in the Nursing Library has been divided up by the shelves, creating a quiet study area that is isolated from the library computers and the lounge area. Behind the printer and photocopiers you will also find two bookable meeting rooms.\n\nThe library houses the collections for Nursing and Midwifery, however; you will also find some material on the social sciences and biology.\n\n==SciTech Library==\n[[File:SciTech Library Interior AUG2019.jpg|thumb|Inside the SciTech Library]]\nThe library is situated within the Jane Foss Russell building, second floor. This building sits at the junction between the Darlington and Camperdown campuses. The library was opened in 2008 following an international design competition.\n\n'''Interior'''\n\nThere are terraced areas dividing the study space and like an autumn forest, the book collection flows in lines of brown, green, red and orange, creating pockets of study areas between the shelves. Around the collection the meeting and training rooms hide behind walls of green glass.\nIn the open foyer which adjoins the information desks, exhibition and lounge areas. These overlook and open onto the terraced study areas, populated by private booths and group tables. There also are adaptable training rooms, more quiet study areas and meeting room. There is also a student kitchen.\n\n==Sydney College of the Arts Library==\n\nThe library space runs over two levels. Downstairs is where you will find the reference reading room, a student gallery, and the computer lab and associated printing and photocopying facilities. There are a couple of seminar rooms available on this level. What you will also find as you walk into the library is the multimedia collection featuring a collection of DVDs and CDs.\n\nUpstairs is where the majority of the collection sits. There are thousands of art theory titles, biographies and collections of artist\u2019s works that make up the bulk of SCA\u2019s research collection. There are spots for quiet study, a second seminar room and a room fitted out for watching DVDs from the collection.\n\n'''Building History'''\n\nThe Sydney College of the Arts is located off Balmain Road in [[Rozelle, New South Wales|Rozelle]] on what is known as the Kirkbride campus. Unlike the rest of the university which was purpose built as an educational institution, this historical site had a very different beginning.\nIt was originally called the [[Callan Park Hospital for the Insane]], and it was the State\u2019s solution to the abhorrent overcrowding and squalid conditions of the two existing asylums at [[Tarban Creek]] and [[Parramatta]]. Built in the 1880s, it operated as a mental health hospital right up to 1994. In 1996, the [[Sydney College of the Arts]] moved in and with it the SCA Library.\n\n== ThinkSpace ==\nThe ThinkSpace is a library owned and run location that is a technology showcase and creative play space, aimed at sparking ideas and providing opportunities for collaboration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.sydney.edu.au/libraries/library-facilities.html|title=University of Sydney Library|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Library facilities|publisher=University of Sydney|access-date=30 August 2016}}</ref> These technologies are supported by Peer Learning Advisers (PLAs) who guide, support and assist clients in using the ThinkSpace.
