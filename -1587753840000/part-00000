Barve is shown to arrive in Pune to meet a prospective groom (whom she has already decided to decline), and inadvertently comes across Joshi to ask for directions to the prospective groom (who is referred to as \u2018''\"\u0939\u0943\u0926\u092f\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u092e\" (Hridaymardyam)''\u2019 after the name of his residential colony). She finds the place, but seeing the door locked, checks out the neighbouring houses to find his whereabouts, but is turned away by the neighbour. She calls up her relative in Mumbai via a public phone (her mobile having run out of battery) and decides to spend the day in Pune, waiting for ''Hridaymardyam'' to show up. She bumps into Joshi again, and asks him directions to the nearest coffee shop. Joshi offers her a ride instead, and she being new in town, agrees, if only to save the hassle of searching for an address again; and they end up having coffee together. In the coffee shop, the two debate about their respective hometowns and constantly try to boast about their own city. She is exasperated by his constant chatter, but they share a curious chemistry nevertheless.\n\nBetween bouts of incessant culture-bashing, they share their life-stories and little secrets (such as him disclosing about his virginity or she telling him about her boyfriend back in Mumbai). She says that since \u2018Hridaymardyam\u2019 has made her wait for him, now she shall meet him at her own leisure. Saying so she asks Joshi to accompany her to a famous local garden-temple, [[Sarasbaug Ganpati|Sarasbaug]] after which they proceed to the local and famous \u2018[[Tulshi Baug]]\u2019 market, and other local attractions thereafter. The duo are shown to begin understanding each other closely, sharing intimate details about their respective love-lives and cultural upbringing, as also their viewpoints on a variety of subjects. Through all of this, Joshi mysteriously never leaves her company, and neither does Barve, despite many scenarios where both could have gone their separate ways.\n\nIn one instance she tries to call ''Hridaymardyam'' from Joshi\u2019s cellphone, but the number is shown to be engaged. Thinking nothing of it, and deciding to return without meeting him, she spends the remaining day with Joshi, until it is time to leave for Mumbai. Finally arriving at the station, Barve hands over a written note to Joshi, explaining her reason for not wanting to marry ''Hridaymardyam'', and asks Joshi to deliver it to him. They both bid their farewells, where they finally for the first time ask each other their names. As Barve identifies herself as just \u2018Mumbai\u2019, Joshi befittingly replies \u2018Pune\u2019. They take each other\u2019s leave, but not before \u2018Pune\u2019 asks her to return his mobile handset which she had earlier kept in her handbag. When asked for his phone number, Joshi mystically replies \"''\u0905\u0938\u0902\u0939\u0940 \u0906\u092a\u0923 \u092a\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0939\u093e \u092d\u0947\u091f\u0923\u093e\u0930 \u0928\u093e\u0939\u0940 ; \u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u0947\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e \u0906\u091c\u091a\u093e \u0926\u093f\u0935\u0938 \u0920\u0947\u0935 \u0915\u0940 \u0906\u0920\u0935\u0923\u0940\u0924 !

In comparison to other beta radiation-emitting nuclides, the electron is moderately energetic. It is blocked by around 1&nbsp;m of air or 5&nbsp;mm of [[acrylic glass]].\n\n== Interaction with other matter ==\n\n[[File:TrigaReactorCore.jpeg|thumb|250px|Blue [[Cherenkov radiation]] light being emitted from a [[TRIGA]] [[pool-type reactor|reactor pool]] is due to high-speed beta particles traveling faster than the speed of light ([[phase velocity]]) in water (which is 75% of the speed of light in vacuum).]]Of the three common types of radiation given off by radioactive materials, [[Alpha particle|alpha]], beta and [[Gamma ray|gamma]], beta has the medium penetrating power and the medium ionising power. Although the beta particles given off by different radioactive materials vary in energy, most beta particles can be stopped by a few millimeters of [[aluminium]]. However, this does not mean that beta-emitting isotopes can be completely shielded by such thin shields: as they decelerate in matter, beta electrons emit secondary gamma rays, which are more penetrating than betas per se. Shielding composed of materials with lower atomic weight generates gammas with lower energy, making such shields somewhat more effective per unit mass than ones made of high-Z materials such as lead.\n\nBeing composed of charged particles, beta radiation is more strongly ionizing than gamma radiation. When passing through matter, a beta particle is decelerated by electromagnetic interactions and may give off [[bremsstrahlung]] [[x-ray]]s.\n\nIn water, beta radiation from many [[nuclear fission product]]s typically exceeds the speed of light in that material (which is 75% that of light in vacuum),<ref>The macroscopic speed of light in water is 75% of the speed of light in a vacuum (called \"c\"). The beta particle is moving faster than 0.75 c, but not faster than c.</ref> and thus generates blue [[Cherenkov radiation]] when it passes through water. The intense beta radiation from the fuel rods of [[pool-type reactor]]s can thus be visualized through the transparent water that covers and shields the reactor (see illustration at right).\n\n=== Detection and measurement ===\n[[File:Beta radiation in a cloud chamber.jpg|thumb|300px|Beta radiation detected in an isopropanol [[cloud chamber]] (after insertion of an artificial source strontium-90)]]\nThe ionizing or excitation effects of beta particles on matter are the fundamental processes by which radiometric detection instruments detect and measure beta radiation. The ionization of gas is used in [[ionization chamber|ion chambers]] and [[Geiger counter|Geiger-M\u00fcller counters]], and the excitation of [[scintillator]]s is used in [[scintillation counter]]s.\nThe following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units:\n{{Radiation related quantities}}\n\n*The [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy),  is the SI unit of [[absorbed dose]], which is the amount of radiation energy deposited in the irradiated material. For beta radiation this is numerically equal to the [[equivalent dose]] measured by the [[sievert]], which indicates the stochastic biological effect of low levels of radiation on human tissue. The radiation weighting conversion factor from absorbed dose to equivalent dose is 1 for beta, whereas alpha particles have a factor of 20, reflecting their greater ionising effect on tissue.\n*The [[rad (unit)|rad]] is the deprecated [[CGS]] unit for absorbed dose and the [[R\u00f6ntgen equivalent man|rem]] is the deprecated [[CGS]] unit of equivalent dose, used mainly in the USA.\n\n== Applications ==\nBeta particles can be used to treat health conditions such as [[Eye neoplasm|eye]] and [[Bone tumor|bone cancer]] and are also used as tracers. [[Strontium-90]] is the material most commonly used to produce beta particles.\n\nBeta particles are also used in quality control to test the thickness of an item, such as [[paper]], coming through a system of rollers. Some of the beta radiation is absorbed while passing through the product. If the product is made too thick or thin, a correspondingly different amount of radiation will be absorbed. A computer program monitoring the quality of the manufactured paper will then move the rollers to change the thickness of the final product.\n\nAn illumination device called a ''[[Beta light|betalight]]'' contains [[tritium]] and a [[phosphor]]. As tritium [[Radioactive decay|decays]], it emits beta particles; these strike the phosphor, causing the phosphor to give off [[photon]]s, much like the [[cathode ray tube]] in a television. The illumination requires no external power, and will continue as long as the tritium exists (and the phosphors do not themselves chemically change); the [[Radiant flux|amount of light produced]] will drop to half its original value in 12.32 years, the [[half-life]] of tritium.\n\nBeta-plus (or [[positron]]) decay of a [[radioactive tracer]] [[isotope]] is the source of the positrons used in [[positron emission tomography]] (PET&nbsp;scan).\n\n== History ==\n[[Henri Becquerel]], while experimenting with [[fluorescence]], accidentally found out that [[uranium]] exposed a [[photographic]] plate, wrapped with black paper, with some unknown [[radiation]] that could not be turned off like [[X-ray]]s.\n\n[[Ernest Rutherford]] continued these experiments and discovered two different kinds of radiation:\n\n* [[alpha particles]] that did not show up on the Becquerel plates because they were easily absorbed by the black wrapping paper\n* beta particles which are 100 times more penetrating than alpha particles.\n\nHe published his results in 1899.<ref>{{cite journal|author=E.

J. Thomson]] used to study cathode rays and identify the electron. He found that {{math|''e''/''m''}} for a beta particle is the same as for Thomson's electron, and therefore suggested that the beta particle is in fact an electron.\n\n== Health ==\nBeta particles are moderately penetrating in living tissue, and can cause spontaneous [[mutation]] in [[DNA]].\n\nBeta sources can be used in [[radiation therapy]] to kill cancer cells.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Electron irradiation]]\n* [[Particle physics]]\n* [[neutron radiation|n (neutron) rays]]\n* [[delta ray|\u03b4 (delta) rays]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://www.oasisllc.com/abgx/radioactivity.htm Radioactivity and alpha, beta, gamma and X&shy;rays]<!-- some company going out of business? -->\n* [http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/rays_and_particles.html Rays and Particles] University of Virginia Lecture Notes\n* [http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/hist.htm History of Radiation] at Idaho State University\n* [http://www.nextenergynews.com/news1/next-energy-news-betavoltaic-10.1.html Betavoltic Battery: Scientists Invent 30 Year Continuous Power Laptop Battery] at NextEnergyNews.com\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005184820/http://community.zdnet.co.uk/blog/0,1000000567,10006069o-2000331777b,00.htm |date=October 5, 2007 |title=Radioactive laptops?

The radiation weighting conversion factor from absorbed dose to equivalent dose is 1 for beta, whereas alpha particles have a factor of 20, reflecting their greater ionising effect on tissue.\n*The [[rad (unit)|rad]] is the deprecated [[CGS]] unit for absorbed dose and the [[R\u00f6ntgen equivalent man|rem]] is the deprecated [[CGS]] unit of equivalent dose, used mainly in the USA.\n\n== Applications ==\nBeta particles can be used to treat health conditions such as [[Eye neoplasm|eye]] and [[Bone tumor|bone cancer]] and are also used as tracers. [[Strontium-90]] is the material most commonly used to produce beta particles.\n\nBeta particles are also used in quality control to test the thickness of an item, such as [[paper]], coming through a system of rollers. Some of the beta radiation is absorbed while passing through the product. If the product is made too thick or thin, a correspondingly different amount of radiation will be absorbed. A computer program monitoring the quality of the manufactured paper will then move the rollers to change the thickness of the final product.\n\nAn illumination device called a ''[[Beta light|betalight]]'' contains [[tritium]] and a [[phosphor]]. As tritium [[Radioactive decay|decays]], it emits beta particles; these strike the phosphor, causing the phosphor to give off [[photon]]s, much like the [[cathode ray tube]] in a television. The illumination requires no external power, and will continue as long as the tritium exists (and the phosphors do not themselves chemically change); the [[Radiant flux|amount of light produced]] will drop to half its original value in 12.32 years, the [[half-life]] of tritium.\n\nBeta-plus (or [[positron]]) decay of a [[radioactive tracer]] [[isotope]] is the source of the positrons used in [[positron emission tomography]] (PET&nbsp;scan).\n\n== History ==\n[[Henri Becquerel]], while experimenting with [[fluorescence]], accidentally found out that [[uranium]] exposed a [[photographic]] plate, wrapped with black paper, with some unknown [[radiation]] that could not be turned off like [[X-ray]]s.\n\n[[Ernest Rutherford]] continued these experiments and discovered two different kinds of radiation:\n\n* [[alpha particles]] that did not show up on the Becquerel plates because they were easily absorbed by the black wrapping paper\n* beta particles which are 100 times more penetrating than alpha particles.\n\nHe published his results in 1899.<ref>{{cite journal|author=E.

J. Thomson]] used to study cathode rays and identify the electron. He found that {{math|''e''/''m''}} for a beta particle is the same as for Thomson's electron, and therefore suggested that the beta particle is in fact an electron.\n\n== Health ==\nBeta particles are moderately penetrating in living tissue, and can cause spontaneous [[mutation]] in [[DNA]].\n\nBeta sources can be used in [[radiation therapy]] to kill cancer cells.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Electron irradiation]]\n* [[Particle physics]]\n* [[neutron radiation|n (neutron) rays]]\n* [[delta ray|\u03b4 (delta) rays]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://www.oasisllc.com/abgx/radioactivity.htm Radioactivity and alpha, beta, gamma and X&shy;rays]<!-- some company going out of business? -->\n* [http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/rays_and_particles.html Rays and Particles] University of Virginia Lecture Notes\n* [http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/hist.htm History of Radiation] at Idaho State University\n* [http://www.nextenergynews.com/news1/next-energy-news-betavoltaic-10.1.html Betavoltic Battery: Scientists Invent 30 Year Continuous Power Laptop Battery] at NextEnergyNews.com\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005184820/http://community.zdnet.co.uk/blog/0,1000000567,10006069o-2000331777b,00.htm |date=October 5, 2007 |title=Radioactive laptops?

This was a windfall for amateur radio enthusiasts, allowing access to fairly inexpensive radios which could easily be modified for use in the 10-meter band.\n\nAmerican Novice- and Technician-class licensees were granted [[Continuous wave|CW]] and [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] segments on the 10-meter band as of 0001 UTC March 21, 1987.<ref>''FCC Report And Order 87-36'', Adopted: January 28, 1987; Released: February 10, 1987. Reprinted in \"Novice Enhancement is A Reality!\", ''Happenings'', ''QST'' Magazine, April 1987, pp. 64-67.</ref>\n\nWith the elimination of [[Morse code]] testing requirements for U.S. amateurs in February 2007, Technician-class licensees who have not passed a code test may operate with up to 200 watts [[Peak envelope power|PEP]] using [[Continuous wave|CW]] and [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] modes in a portion of the 10-meter band.\n\n== Operating ==\n[[Image:10 Meter 2Way Radio.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Uniden President HR2510A, a mobile 10-meter radio.]]\nBeing a very wide band in HF terms, many different transmission modes can be found on 10 meters. [[Morse code]] and other [[narrowband]] modes are found toward the bottom portion of the band, [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]] from 28.300&nbsp;MHz up, and [[wideband]] modes ([[Amplitude Modulation|AM]] and [[Frequency Modulation|FM]]) are found near the upper part of the bottom portion of the band. Digital modes, such as [[PSK-31]], are also allowed in the upper portion of the band, with 28.120 being a popular PSK-31 frequency.\n\n== Propagation characteristics ==\n{{See also|Radio propagation}}\nDue to its unique spot in the spectrum, 10 meters can occasionally be challenging to work. At peak times of the [[solar cycle]] when many [[sunspots]] appear on the Sun's surface, 10 meters can be alive with extremely long-distance signals, refracting from the [[F region|F2 layer]] in the [[ionosphere]]. Generally speaking, the most effective and efficient propagation of 10-meter radio waves takes place during local daylight hours.  During periods of increased sunspot activity, band openings may begin well before sunrise and continue into the night.\n\nLong-distance opportunities via F2 seem to follow the sun across the globe. In North America, for instance, F2 might bring Europe and western Asia in the morning, the Americas during midday, and the Pacific and East Asia in late afternoon and early evening.\n\nEven in times of [[solar minimum]], when F2 is rarely available, 10 meters still has some long distance possibilities. [[Sporadic E propagation]] can bring in signals from a hundred to many thousands of miles away. Sporadic E on 10 meters is mainly a seasonal event, with late spring and early summer being prime time for the mode. A shorter, less-intense period occurs during mid-winter, often between Christmas and the new year. Other, off-peak openings may be seen almost anytime. Even during solar minimum, F2 openings often occur on [[TV-FM DX|transequatorial paths]], for example between Europe and [[Southern Africa]] or between Pacific [[North America]] and the Eastern Pacific islands.\n\nIn tropical latitudes 10 meters is open throughout the sunspot cycle, although propagation is often confined to other areas lying along the equator. For example, a good path from West Africa to the Caribbean exists on 10 meters even at solar minimum.\n\n== 10-meter sub-bands ==\nAlthough 10 meters has a worldwide amateur radio allocation, in some countries the use of portions of 10 meters is allocated by the government by license class, by signal mode or signal bandwidth. Beyond these regulations there is also a general voluntary band plan adhered to by amateurs throughout the world.\n\n=== Worldwide frequency allocations ===\nWorldwide 10 meter frequency allocations are specified by the ITU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/hfband.htm |title=Amateur HF Bands |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio operations in the frequency range from 28.000 to 29.700&nbsp;MHz.\n\n=== IARU Region 1 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 70px | 28000-28070\n! width= 120px | 28070-28190\n! width= 35px | 28190-28225\n! width= 400px | 28225-29510\n! width= 20px | 29510-29520\n! width= 180px | 29520-29700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 1\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n| style=\"background-color: white\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n=== IARU Region 2 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 70px | 28000-28070\n! width= 120px | 28070-28190\n! width= 10px | 28190-28300\n! width= 400px | 28300-29510\n! width= 20px | 29510-29520\n! width= 180px | 29520-29700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 2\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n| style=\"background-color: white\" |\n| style=\"background-color: #E8AFF5\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n=== IARU Region 3 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 50px | 28000-28050\n! width= 100px | 28050-28150\n! width= 40px | 28150-28190\n! width= 20px | 28190-28200\n! width= 100px | 28200-28300\n! width= 400px | 28300-29700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 3\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n===USA===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:70%\"\n! width=120px | 10 Meters\n! width=150px | 28000 \u2013 28300\n! width=100px | 28300 \u2013 28500\n! width=600px | 28500 \u2013 29700\n|-\n| Novice / Technician\n| style=\"background-color: orange\" |\n| style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n|\n|-\n| General, Advanced, Extra\n| style=\"background-color: orange\" |\n| style=\"background-color: black\" |\n| style=\"background-color: black\" |\n|}\n\n=== Canada 10 meter band plan ===\nCanada is part of region 2 and as such is subject to the IARU band plan.

The surplus equipment would land in 10&nbsp;kHz steps on the 5&nbsp;kHz step such as: 29.015, 29.025, 29.035, etc. Users of the surplus equipment also inherited those radios' odd channel spacing, which on CB skipped channels that were not used there, because they were set aside for remote control operations.\n\n=== Satellite sub-band ===\nFrom 29.300&nbsp;MHz to 29.510&nbsp;MHz the satellite sub band allows amateur radio operators to communicate with orbiting [[OSCAR]]s.\n\n==== Satellite operation ====\nMany amateur radio satellites have either an uplink or a downlink in the 29&nbsp;MHz range.

Due to the very few available repeater channels, \"odd-splits\" (offsets differing from 100&nbsp;kHz) and non-standard frequencies are not uncommon. Since 10 meters can frequently open up to propagate globally, most 10-meter repeaters use a [[Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System|CTCSS]] sub-audible access tone. 16&nbsp;kHz wide signals with 5&nbsp;kHz deviation is normal in this band. 8&nbsp;kHz narrow signals with 2.5&nbsp;kHz deviation can also be found.\n\n=== FM simplex channels ===\n29.300&nbsp;MHz is a common frequency to find JA hams on. British hams commonly use the 29.400 to 29.500&nbsp;MHz band for FM as well with 29.400, 29.450, and 29.500&nbsp;MHz being common. USA hams can be found on FM anywhere above 29.000&nbsp;MHz, commonly on the above frequencies talking to overseas hams.  29.200 to 29.300&nbsp;MHz is set aside in some area band plans for FM Simplex use.\n\n== Organizations and enthusiasts ==\n* [http://www.ten-ten.org Ten-Ten International]\n* [https://breezeshooters.org/ The Breeze Shooters ARC]\n* [[Hamwave]]\n* [[Margarita & Martini 10-10 Chapter of Georgia]]\n\nDue to its unique nature, 10 meters has a large following of hobbyists who spend most of their time on this frequency band.

This was a windfall for amateur radio enthusiasts, allowing access to fairly inexpensive radios which could easily be modified for use in the 10-meter band.\n\nAmerican Novice- and Technician-class licensees were granted [[Continuous wave|CW]] and [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] segments on the 10-meter band as of 0001 UTC March 21, 1987.<ref>''FCC Report And Order 87-36'', Adopted: January 28, 1987; Released: February 10, 1987. Reprinted in \"Novice Enhancement is A Reality!\", ''Happenings'', ''QST'' Magazine, April 1987, pp. 64-67.</ref>\n\nWith the elimination of [[Morse code]] testing requirements for U.S. amateurs in February 2007, Technician-class licensees who have not passed a code test may operate with up to 200 watts [[Peak envelope power|PEP]] using [[Continuous wave|CW]] and [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] modes in a portion of the 10-meter band.\n\n== Operating ==\n[[Image:10 Meter 2Way Radio.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Uniden President HR2510A, a mobile 10-meter radio.]]\nBeing a very wide band in HF terms, many different transmission modes can be found on 10 meters. [[Morse code]] and other [[narrowband]] modes are found toward the bottom portion of the band, [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]] from 28.300&nbsp;MHz up, and [[wideband]] modes ([[Amplitude Modulation|AM]] and [[Frequency Modulation|FM]]) are found near the upper part of the bottom portion of the band. Digital modes, such as [[PSK-31]], are also allowed in the upper portion of the band, with 28.120 being a popular PSK-31 frequency.\n\n== Propagation characteristics ==\n{{See also|Radio propagation}}\nDue to its unique spot in the spectrum, 10 meters can occasionally be challenging to work. At peak times of the [[solar cycle]] when many [[sunspots]] appear on the Sun's surface, 10 meters can be alive with extremely long-distance signals, refracting from the [[F region|F2 layer]] in the [[ionosphere]]. Generally speaking, the most effective and efficient propagation of 10-meter radio waves takes place during local daylight hours.  During periods of increased sunspot activity, band openings may begin well before sunrise and continue into the night.\n\nLong-distance opportunities via F2 seem to follow the sun across the globe. In North America, for instance, F2 might bring Europe and western Asia in the morning, the Americas during midday, and the Pacific and East Asia in late afternoon and early evening.\n\nEven in times of [[solar minimum]], when F2 is rarely available, 10 meters still has some long distance possibilities. [[Sporadic E propagation]] can bring in signals from a hundred to many thousands of miles away. Sporadic E on 10 meters is mainly a seasonal event, with late spring and early summer being prime time for the mode. A shorter, less-intense period occurs during mid-winter, often between Christmas and the new year. Other, off-peak openings may be seen almost anytime. Even during solar minimum, F2 openings often occur on [[TV-FM DX|transequatorial paths]], for example between Europe and [[Southern Africa]] or between Pacific [[North America]] and the Eastern Pacific islands.\n\nIn tropical latitudes 10 meters is open throughout the sunspot cycle, although propagation is often confined to other areas lying along the equator. For example, a good path from West Africa to the Caribbean exists on 10 meters even at solar minimum.\n\n== 10-meter sub-bands ==\nAlthough 10 meters has a worldwide amateur radio allocation, in some countries the use of portions of 10 meters is allocated by the government by license class, by signal mode or signal bandwidth. Beyond these regulations there is also a general voluntary band plan adhered to by amateurs throughout the world.\n\n=== Worldwide frequency allocations ===\nWorldwide 10 meter frequency allocations are specified by the ITU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/hfband.htm |title=Amateur HF Bands |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio operations in the frequency range from 28.000 to 29.700&nbsp;MHz.\n\n=== IARU Region 1 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 70px | 28000-28070\n! width= 120px | 28070-28190\n! width= 35px | 28190-28225\n! width= 400px | 28225-29510\n! width= 20px | 29510-29520\n! width= 180px | 29520-29700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 1\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n| style=\"background-color: white\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n=== IARU Region 2 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 70px | 28000-28070\n! width= 120px | 28070-28190\n! width= 10px | 28190-28300\n! width= 400px | 28300-29510\n! width= 20px | 29510-29520\n! width= 180px | 29520-29700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 2\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n| style=\"background-color: white\" |\n| style=\"background-color: #E8AFF5\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n=== IARU Region 3 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 50px | 28000-28050\n! width= 100px | 28050-28150\n! width= 40px | 28150-28190\n! width= 20px | 28190-28200\n! width= 100px | 28200-28300\n! width= 400px | 28300-29700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 3\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n===USA===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:70%\"\n! width=120px | 10 Meters\n! width=150px | 28000 \u2013 28300\n! width=100px | 28300 \u2013 28500\n! width=600px | 28500 \u2013 29700\n|-\n| Novice / Technician\n| style=\"background-color: orange\" |\n| style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n|\n|-\n| General, Advanced, Extra\n| style=\"background-color: orange\" |\n| style=\"background-color: black\" |\n| style=\"background-color: black\" |\n|}\n\n=== Canada 10 meter band plan ===\nCanada is part of region 2 and as such is subject to the IARU band plan.

The Novice sub-bands consist of two frequency ranges; one for CW and Data operation, and the other for SSB phone operation.\n\n==== Novice CW ====\n28.000&nbsp;MHz - 28.300&nbsp;MHz is a very active part of 10 meters for CW operation.\n\n==== Novice/Technician phone ====\n28.300&nbsp;MHz - 28.500&nbsp;MHz is probably the most active part of the 10-meter band. Operation in this segment is almost exclusively SSB worldwide.\n\n=== Beacons ===\nBecause the propagation on 10 meters can vary drastically throughout the day, [[Radio propagation beacon|propagation beacons]] are very important to gauge the current conditions of the band. With some differences in each [[ITU Region]]s and also from country to country, the beacon sub-bands fall between 28.100&nbsp;MHz and 28.300&nbsp;MHz. ITU Region 1 is generally 28.190&nbsp;MHz - 28.225&nbsp;MHz and ITU Region 2 is generally 28.200&nbsp;MHz - 28.300&nbsp;MHz.\n\nA list of 10-meter propagation beacons is available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qsl.net/wj5o/bcn.htm |title=10-metre propagation beacons}}</ref>\n\n<!-- <ref>{{cite web |url=http://userpages.troycable.net/~wj5o/bcn.htm |title=10-metre propagation beacons |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205121353/http://userpages.troycable.net/~wj5o/bcn.htm |archivedate=2012-02-05 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n-->\n\n=== AM sub-band ===\nFrom 29.000&nbsp;MHz to 29.200&nbsp;MHz. Formerly-common practice was to use the band in 10&nbsp;kHz steps: e.g. 29.010, 29.020, 29.030,... etc. This has not been the case since the 1970s, which saw an influx of surplus 23-channel [[Citizens band radio|CB]] equipment modified for use on the 10-meter amateur band. The surplus equipment would land in 10&nbsp;kHz steps on the 5&nbsp;kHz step such as: 29.015, 29.025, 29.035, etc. Users of the surplus equipment also inherited those radios' odd channel spacing, which on CB skipped channels that were not used there, because they were set aside for remote control operations.\n\n=== Satellite sub-band ===\nFrom 29.300&nbsp;MHz to 29.510&nbsp;MHz the satellite sub band allows amateur radio operators to communicate with orbiting [[OSCAR]]s.\n\n==== Satellite operation ====\nMany amateur radio satellites have either an uplink or a downlink in the 29&nbsp;MHz range. Information about particular satellites and operational modes is available from AMSAT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww2.amsat.org/ |title=AMSAT-NA |url-status=dead |accessdate=28 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528231659/http://ww2.amsat.org/ |archive-date=2013-05-28 }}</ref> \n\nAs of the current writing, only AO-7's 10m downlink is active.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php |title=Operational OSCAR Satellite Status Summary |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115132508/http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php |archivedate=2013-01-15 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> \n\n=== FM sub-band ===\nFrom 29.510&nbsp;MHz to 29.700, The FM sub-band is usually channelized into [[repeater]] and [[Simplex communication|simplex]] frequencies. The channels are commonly grouped into repeater inputs, simplex, and repeater output frequencies.\n\nRepeater Input Channels:\n29.520, 29.540, 29.560, and 29.580&nbsp;MHz.\n\n'''Simplex Channel, Worldwide calling FM: 29.600&nbsp;MHz'''\n\nRepeater Output Channels:\n29.620, 29.640, 29.660, and 29.680&nbsp;MHz.\n\n==== Repeater operation ====\nCommon practice for 10-meter repeaters is to use a 100&nbsp;kHz negative offset for repeater operation. Due to the very few available repeater channels, \"odd-splits\" (offsets differing from 100&nbsp;kHz) and non-standard frequencies are not uncommon. Since 10 meters can frequently open up to propagate globally, most 10-meter repeaters use a [[Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System|CTCSS]] sub-audible access tone. 16&nbsp;kHz wide signals with 5&nbsp;kHz deviation is normal in this band. 8&nbsp;kHz narrow signals with 2.5&nbsp;kHz deviation can also be found.\n\n=== FM simplex channels ===\n29.300&nbsp;MHz is a common frequency to find JA hams on. British hams commonly use the 29.400 to 29.500&nbsp;MHz band for FM as well with 29.400, 29.450, and 29.500&nbsp;MHz being common. USA hams can be found on FM anywhere above 29.000&nbsp;MHz, commonly on the above frequencies talking to overseas hams.  29.200 to 29.300&nbsp;MHz is set aside in some area band plans for FM Simplex use.\n\n== Organizations and enthusiasts ==\n* [http://www.ten-ten.org Ten-Ten International]\n* [https://breezeshooters.org/ The Breeze Shooters ARC]\n* [[Hamwave]]\n* [[Margarita & Martini 10-10 Chapter of Georgia]]\n\nDue to its unique nature, 10 meters has a large following of hobbyists who spend most of their time on this frequency band.

Both series have decades of history and have been intertwined in the public imagination for some time, not least of all because the driving creative force behind both was [[Mangaka|manga artist]] [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] and both were produced by the same production company, [[Toei Company]]; however, they did not air together until [[2000 in television|2000]] with ''[[Kamen Rider Kuuga]]'' and ''[[Kyuukyuu Sentai GoGoFive]]'' (which was later replaced by ''[[Mirai Sentai Timeranger]]''), though at the time they were not acknowledged together. Super Hero Time airs every Sunday morning, from 9:00 to 10:00 [[Japan Standard Time|JST]]. The block is shown all over Japan via the [[All-Nippon News Network]]. Though, in other prefectures, one or both shows can be seen on other stations which are not affiliated with ANN.\n\n==History==\nStarting in the late 1960s, the hour was originally meant for educational children's programs. Over the years the hour began including ''henshin'' (transforming) hero programs, one of the first being {{Nihongo|''[[Rainbowman|Warrior of Love, Rainbowman]]''|\u611b\u306e\u6226\u58eb\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30de\u30f3|Ai no Senshi Reinb\u014dman}}.\n\nOn October 4, 1987, Toei's ''[[Choujinki Metalder]]'' was moved from a Monday evening 19:00 JST time slot to a Sunday morning 9:00 JST time slot, followed by a move of ''[[Kidou Keiji Jiban]]'' to 8:00 JST Sunday morning on April 2, 1989. Similarly, on April 6, 1997, ''[[Denji Sentai Megaranger]]'' was moved from a Friday evening 17:00 JST time slot to the Sunday morning 7:30 JST time slot, pairing it up with ''[[B-Robo Kabutack]]''. The ''Super Sentai'' Series programs would continue to air at 7:30 JST after the ''Metal Hero'' Series ended and ''[[Moero!! Robocon]]'' aired in its slot on January 31, 1999 and was followed by the premiere of ''[[Kamen Rider Kuuga]]'' on January 30, 2000.\n\nAlthough a ''Super Sentai'' Series and a ''Kamen Rider'' Series aired side-by-side, the Super Hero Time branding of the shows did not begin until the Autumn 2003 broadcast season (known as {{Nihongo|SUPER Hero Time|SUPER\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0}} until the 2005 broadcast season). As part of the block, actors from the programs often interact with each other to promote each other's shows, films, and perform skits. [[Search Guard Successor Foundation#Satoru Akashi|Satoru Akashi]] ([[Mitsuomi Takahashi]]) and [[Kamen Rider Kabuto (character)|Souji Tendou]] ([[Hiro Mizushima]]) talked about each other's universes, and [[Geki J\u016bken Beast Arts#Master Xia Fu|Master Xia Fu]] (voiced by [[Ichir\u014d Nagai]]) often showed up on the [[Kamen Rider Den-O (character)#DenLiner|Den-Liner]] to talk with the [[Imagin#Den-O's Imagin|Imagin]] and [[Kamen Rider Den-O (character)|Ryotaro Nogami]] ([[Takeru Satoh]]) in cartoonish caricatures. The 2008 broadcast introduced new changes to the block, including scenes from the show's episode.\n\nFor the 2009 television season, ''[[Kamen Rider Decade]]'' only aired for 31 episodes, allowing for the broadcast of ''[[Kamen Rider W]]'' for a full 49-episode run. This has introduced an offset of five months between the series premieres of the yearly ''Super Sentai'' Series (which premieres in mid February) and ''Kamen Rider'' Series (which premiered in early September since then), instead of an approximate month long offset that had existed before (''Kamen Rider'' Series premiered in mid-January). This offset was shortened to four months after the finale of the 53 episode-long ''[[Kamen Rider Wizard]]'', delaying the premiere of subsequent ''Kamen Rider'' Series to early October until the debut of ''[[Kamen Rider Build]]'' in early September, resulting in the increase of the offset to seven months. In 2019, this offset was reduced to six months with the premiere of ''[[Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger]]'' in March after its time slot was occupied by the four-week long miniseries ''[[Super Sentai Strongest Battle]]''.\n\nThe ''Super Hero Time'' block is part of the larger {{Nihongo|Nichi Asa Kids Time|\u30cb\u30c1\u30a2\u30b5\u30ad\u30c3\u30ba\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0|Nichi Asa Kizzu Taimu|\"Sunday Morning Kids Time\"}} block, which begins at 8:30 JST with the airing of an [[Asahi Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Television]]-produced [[sh\u014djo anime]] animated by [[Toei Animation]] (currently the ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' series with ''[[Healin' Good PreCure]]'') and ends at 10:00 JST after the airing of the ''Super Sentai'' series. All of the shows are properties of [[Bandai]], who also sponsors the block. While ''Super Hero Time'' began airing with such anime in its inception, the \"Nichi Asa Kids Time\" branding did not begin until March 4, 2007.\n\nOn October 1, 2017, the block moved to 9:00 JST, with the ''Kamen Rider'' series airing before the ''Super Sentai'' series.\n\n==Line-ups==\n===Japan===\n<!-- No other programs are part of this block.

Both series have decades of history and have been intertwined in the public imagination for some time, not least of all because the driving creative force behind both was [[Mangaka|manga artist]] [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] and both were produced by the same production company, [[Toei Company]]; however, they did not air together until [[2000 in television|2000]] with ''[[Kamen Rider Kuuga]]'' and ''[[Kyuukyuu Sentai GoGoFive]]'' (which was later replaced by ''[[Mirai Sentai Timeranger]]''), though at the time they were not acknowledged together. Super Hero Time airs every Sunday morning, from 9:00 to 10:00 [[Japan Standard Time|JST]]. The block is shown all over Japan via the [[All-Nippon News Network]]. Though, in other prefectures, one or both shows can be seen on other stations which are not affiliated with ANN.\n\n==History==\nStarting in the late 1960s, the hour was originally meant for educational children's programs. Over the years the hour began including ''henshin'' (transforming) hero programs, one of the first being {{Nihongo|''[[Rainbowman|Warrior of Love, Rainbowman]]''|\u611b\u306e\u6226\u58eb\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30de\u30f3|Ai no Senshi Reinb\u014dman}}.\n\nOn October 4, 1987, Toei's ''[[Choujinki Metalder]]'' was moved from a Monday evening 19:00 JST time slot to a Sunday morning 9:00 JST time slot, followed by a move of ''[[Kidou Keiji Jiban]]'' to 8:00 JST Sunday morning on April 2, 1989. Similarly, on April 6, 1997, ''[[Denji Sentai Megaranger]]'' was moved from a Friday evening 17:00 JST time slot to the Sunday morning 7:30 JST time slot, pairing it up with ''[[B-Robo Kabutack]]''. The ''Super Sentai'' Series programs would continue to air at 7:30 JST after the ''Metal Hero'' Series ended and ''[[Moero!! Robocon]]'' aired in its slot on January 31, 1999 and was followed by the premiere of ''[[Kamen Rider Kuuga]]'' on January 30, 2000.\n\nAlthough a ''Super Sentai'' Series and a ''Kamen Rider'' Series aired side-by-side, the Super Hero Time branding of the shows did not begin until the Autumn 2003 broadcast season (known as {{Nihongo|SUPER Hero Time|SUPER\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0}} until the 2005 broadcast season). As part of the block, actors from the programs often interact with each other to promote each other's shows, films, and perform skits. [[Search Guard Successor Foundation#Satoru Akashi|Satoru Akashi]] ([[Mitsuomi Takahashi]]) and [[Kamen Rider Kabuto (character)|Souji Tendou]] ([[Hiro Mizushima]]) talked about each other's universes, and [[Geki J\u016bken Beast Arts#Master Xia Fu|Master Xia Fu]] (voiced by [[Ichir\u014d Nagai]]) often showed up on the [[Kamen Rider Den-O (character)#DenLiner|Den-Liner]] to talk with the [[Imagin#Den-O's Imagin|Imagin]] and [[Kamen Rider Den-O (character)|Ryotaro Nogami]] ([[Takeru Satoh]]) in cartoonish caricatures. The 2008 broadcast introduced new changes to the block, including scenes from the show's episode.\n\nFor the 2009 television season, ''[[Kamen Rider Decade]]'' only aired for 31 episodes, allowing for the broadcast of ''[[Kamen Rider W]]'' for a full 49-episode run. This has introduced an offset of five months between the series premieres of the yearly ''Super Sentai'' Series (which premieres in mid February) and ''Kamen Rider'' Series (which premiered in early September since then), instead of an approximate month long offset that had existed before (''Kamen Rider'' Series premiered in mid-January). This offset was shortened to four months after the finale of the 53 episode-long ''[[Kamen Rider Wizard]]'', delaying the premiere of subsequent ''Kamen Rider'' Series to early October until the debut of ''[[Kamen Rider Build]]'' in early September, resulting in the increase of the offset to seven months. In 2019, this offset was reduced to six months with the premiere of ''[[Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger]]'' in March after its time slot was occupied by the four-week long miniseries ''[[Super Sentai Strongest Battle]]''.\n\nThe ''Super Hero Time'' block is part of the larger {{Nihongo|Nichi Asa Kids Time|\u30cb\u30c1\u30a2\u30b5\u30ad\u30c3\u30ba\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0|Nichi Asa Kizzu Taimu|\"Sunday Morning Kids Time\"}} block, which begins at 8:30 JST with the airing of an [[Asahi Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Television]]-produced [[sh\u014djo anime]] animated by [[Toei Animation]] (currently the ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' series with ''[[Healin' Good PreCure]]'') and ends at 10:00 JST after the airing of the Super Sentai series. All of the shows are properties of [[Bandai]], who also sponsors the block. While ''Super Hero Time'' began airing with such anime in its inception, the \"Nichi Asa Kids Time\" branding did not begin until March 4, 2007.\n\nOn October 1, 2017, the block moved to 9:00 JST, with the Kamen Rider series airing before the Super Sentai series.\n\n==Line-ups==\n===Japan===\n<!-- No other programs are part of this block. While ''Kuuga'', ''Agito'', and ''Ryuki'', and ''GoGoFive'', ''Timeranger'', ''Gaoranger'', and ''Hurricaneger'' aired at 7:30 and 8:00 am on Sundays in Japan, this block was officially named during the ''555'' and ''Abaranger'' broadcasts.

Peirce]], she was alive when Osman was enthroned as sultan in 1618 after the deposition of incompetent [[Mustafa I]]; Peirce believes that she was not living in the palace during his son's reign nor did she act as ''[[valide sultan]]'', as privy purse registers listed no ''valide sultan'' during Osman's reign.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} Also from the middle of 1620, Osman's governess, the ''daye hatun'', began to receive an extraordinary large stipend, one thousand aspers a day rather than her usual two hundred aspers, an indication that she was now the official stand-in for the Valide Sultan.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} Mahfiruz may have fallen out of favour, judging by her absence in the palace and burial in Ey\u00fcb rather than with her husband, and never have recovered her status as a royal consort.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} Venetian ambassador Contarini reported the beating of a woman who had irritated [[K\u00f6sem Sultan|K\u00f6sem]], ordered by the sultan, in 1612, which may be identified to Mahfiruz.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} She may have been a rival of K\u00f6sem, who made efforts to keep [[Mustafa I|Mustafa]] safe from execution, and saw an obstacle in Mahfiruz.{{why|date=February 2016}}{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} She was buried in the large sanctuary of [[Ey\u00fcp]], [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}}\n\n<gallery>\nLevni.

A major factor for this change was an 1896 law that required that English \"be the only medium and basis of instruction in all public and private schools\". This law prevented the Hawaiian language from being taught as a second language.

The Hawaiian language has been promoted for revival most recently by a state program of cultural preservation enacted in 1978.

In [[Hawaii]], native Hawaiians are publicly educated by the Hawai\u02bbi State [[Department of Education]], an ethnically diverse school system that is the United States' largest and most centralized.\n\nUnder the administration of Governor [[Benjamin J. Cayetano]] from 1994 to 2002, the state's educational system established special Hawaiian language immersion schools. In these schools, all subject courses are taught in the Hawaiian language and use native Hawaiian subject matter in curricula. These schools were created in the [[spirit]] of cultural preservation and are not exclusive to native Hawaiian children.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\nNative Hawaiians are eligible for an education from the [[Kamehameha Schools]], established through the last will and testament of [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]] of the [[House of Kamehameha|Kamehameha Dynasty]]. The largest and wealthiest [[private school]] in the United States, Kamehameha Schools was intended to benefit indigents and orphans, with preference given to native Hawaiians. The Kamehameha Schools provides a quality education to thousands of children of entire and part native Hawaiian ancestry at its campuses during the regular school year, and also has quality summer and off-campus programs that are not restricted by ancestry. Kamehameha Schools' practice of accepting primarily gifted students, in lieu of intellectually challenged children, has been a controversial topic amongst the native Hawaiian community. Many 'rejected' families feel that the gifted students could excel at any learning institution, public or private. Thus, the Hawaiian community may be better served by educating children from high-risk, high-crime districts so that a greater proportion of disadvantaged youths may grow up to be responsible community contributors.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAs with other children in Hawai\u02bbi, some native Hawaiians are educated by other prominent private academies in the Aloha State.

The phrase \u201c''E ho\u02bbohuli ka lima i lalo''\u201d (The palms of the hands should be turned down) was used to communicate the idea that idleness (associated with upturned palms) was to be avoided.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''Collaborative and flexible ensembles'''\n\nNative Hawaiian children [[Cooperation|cooperate]] with flexible leadership to combine their skills, ideas, and abilities, like that found in [[observational learning]] in the indigenous communities of the Americas. Family organization is a \u201cshared-function\u201d system that includes flexible roles and fluid responsibility within the group. Basic family values include interdependence, responsibility for others, sharing of work and resources, obedience, and respect. Children assume important family responsibilities early and act as members of a sibling workforce that is held collectively responsible for completing tasks.<ref name=\":4\">G. Tharp, Cathie Jordan, Gisela E. Speidel, Kathryn Hu-pei Au, Thomas W. Klein, Roderick P. Calkins, Kim C. M. Sloat, Ronald Gallimore (2007). Education and Native Hawaiian Children: Revisiting KEEP.

Children also scan to provide help to others when necessary. In this way, children shift between the roles of assisted and assistant. Adults were present and available, but the children were more often found to take the initiative to learn from, and teach, one another how to perform tasks such as sweeping, homework, and caring for younger siblings.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Learning to transform participation'''\n\nAmong Native Hawaiians, the goal of learning is to transform [[Youth participation|participation]] to encompass conscientious accountability as active contributing members of the community,<ref name=\":0\" /> like that found in [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]]. For example, in some Native Hawaiian communities, parent(s) teach the older siblings the necessary skills of care taking. Sibling care-taking skills can relate to indigenous American ways of learning by the children becoming considerate of their parents and taking on the responsibility when needed in case of a tragic incident with the parents.<ref>Cicirelli, V. (1994). Sibling Relationships in Cross-Cultural Perspective. Journal of Marriage and Family,56(1), 7-20. {{doi|10.2307/352697}}\n</ref> Within the classroom and home settings, adults are present but are not always directly monitoring the children. Children ask for help when necessary, but adults appear to rarely interject. Children appeared to adapt to tasks and situations by observations and go off on their own to collectively work out how and what to do to complete the task.\n\n[[Fosterage|Assuming and initiating care]] has been found across Polynesian cultures, and Native Hawaiian practices are in keeping with this trend. One study observed, interviewed, and evaluated families on the Polynesian Island Sikaiana and found that fostering children from other families within the community is a common shared endeavor that serves to construct relationships, support the community, and nurture compassion and sympathy [[Aloha|(''aloha'']]).<ref name=\":6\">Donner, W. W. (1999). Sharing and Compassion: Fosterage in a Polynesian Society. Journal of Comparative Family Studies, 30(4), autumn, 703-722. Retrieved May 25, 2017.</ref> As children mature within the family, they go through a process of having their needs attended and learn to provide and care for the younger children alongside the adults. Adolescent girls who are active caretakers are referred to as parents, even if there is no biological connection.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n'''Wide and keen attention for contribution'''\n\nThe Hawaiians\u2019 ways of learning include wide keen attention from the children while adults are available for guidance, also found in the model of [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]]. Children were found to learn from adults by participating in group activities where they had the chance to observe the performance of more experienced participants as well as having errors in their own performance corrected by more seasoned group members.<ref name=\":4\" /> Because the children [[Observational learning|learn through observation]], and then are encouraged to practice among their peers, we can speculate the children have keen attention to events around them, which is an expectation of adults and community members who are there to assist when needed.<ref name=\":3\" /> It has been observed that Hawaiian children were successful at completing tasks which greatly depend on visual and memory process skills, which coincides with Hawaiian mother's frequent use of non-verbal communication.<ref>Speidel, G. E., Farran, D. C., & Jordan, C. (1989). 6: On the Learning and Thinking Styles of Hawaiian Children. In Thinking Across Cultures (pp. 55-77). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref>\n\n'''Coordination through shared reference'''\n\nIn some Native Hawaiian communities, there is a constant use of [[Storytelling|\u201ctalk story\u201d]] which plays an essential role in promoting solidarity in the community by not overpowering or making the members of the community feel inadequate for not understanding something. Talk story can consist of recalled events, folktales, and joking. Joking can be used to tease and guide the children about how to do a chore better or to avoid serious trouble.<ref>Smith-Hefner, N. J. (1987), Speaking Relating and Learning: A Study of Hawaiian Children at Home and at School: Stephen T. Boggs. TESOL Quarterly, 21: 759\u2013763. {{doi|10.2307/3586993}}</ref> Talk story relates to an Indigenous way of learning by providing conversations such as narratives and dramatizations with verbal and nonverbal communication between the elder and children.\n\nAnother example of verbal communication in the Native Hawaiian culture is through the use of [[chant]]ing, which can allow a child to understand the relationship of their present experiences to those of their ancestors, both alive and deceased. Chanting also allows children to understand the connections of their chants to mother earth. For instance, chanting can voice the need for rain to produce plants and induce ponds to grow fish for harvest.<ref name=\":5\">Meyer, Manu Aluli (1998) Native Hawaiian Epistemology: Sites of Empowerment and Resistance, Equity & Excellence in Education, 31:1, 22-28, {{DOI|10.1080/1066568980310104}}</ref>\n\nA study comparing Midwestern and Hawaiian mother \u2013 Kindergartener pairs presented with a novel task,<ref name=\":4\" /> found Hawaiian mothers to be much lower than their Midwestern counterparts in the use of verbal-control techniques and much higher in non-verbal communication, a finding which implies coordination through [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] and verbal means.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Aspects of togetherness, continuity, purpose, and significance are a part of learning and coincide with the Native Hawaiian's spiritual connection to earth and environment.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n'''Feedback that appraises mastery and support for learning'''\n\nThere is verbal and nonverbal guidance from parents to children with chores and other activities. For example, a pat on the shoulder can communicate to the child that he/she is doing the activity at hand the correct way.<ref name=\":2\" /> This example relates to the [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]] model by there being an appraisal from the parent(s) in order to support their progress in learning and contributing better in the community. As the child gradually advances towards more complex tasks, the goal of mastery and feedback on the adequacy of their contributions become more pronounced.\n\nIn the context of producing objects e.g. baskets, mats, or quilts, there was a belief that a child must produce a perfect end-product before moving on to learn the skills of producing something else. Perfection in these products was judged by more experienced craftspeople and was attained by repeated attempts interspersed with feedback. The perfected final products were kept as a special reminder and never used. Their production was seen as a necessary first step in \u201cclearing the way\u201d for other products to come; an indication of mastery for that skill set.<ref name=\":1\" /> Throughout several research articles, it becomes clear that many of the Native Hawaiian ways of learning resemble the defining characteristics of [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]], which is common in many Indigenous communities of the Americas.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Hawaiian cultural revival==\n\n{{see also|Culture of the Native Hawaiians|Hawaii#Culture}}\n\nNative Hawaiian culture has seen a revival in recent years as an outgrowth of decisions made at the [[1978 Hawai\u02bbi State Constitutional Convention]], held 200 years after the arrival of Captain Cook. At the convention, the Hawai\u02bbi state government committed itself to a progressive study and preservation of native Hawaiian culture, history, and language.\n\nA comprehensive Hawaiian culture curriculum was introduced into the State of Hawai\u02bbi's public elementary schools teaching: ancient Hawaiian art, lifestyle, geography, [[hula]], and Hawaiian language vocabulary. Intermediate and high schools were mandated to impose two sets of Hawaiian history curricula on every candidate for graduation.\n\nStatutes and charter amendments were passed acknowledging a policy of preference for Hawaiian place and street names. For example, with the closure of [[Barbers Point Naval Air Station]] in the 1990s, the region formerly occupied by the base was renamed [[Kalaeloa]].\n\n==Office of Hawaiian Affairs==\n{{main|Office of Hawaiian Affairs}}\nAnother important outgrowth of the 1978 Hawai\u02bbi State Constitutional Convention was the establishment of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, more popularly known as OHA. Delegates that included future Hawai\u02bbi political stars [[Benjamin J. Cayetano]], [[John D. Waihee III]], and [[Jeremy Harris (politician)|Jeremy Harris]] enacted measures intended to address injustices toward native Hawaiians since the [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi]] in 1893. OHA was established as a trust, administered with a mandate to better the conditions of both native Hawaiians and the Hawaiian community in general. OHA was given control over certain public lands, and continues to expand its land-holdings to this day (most recently with Waimea Valley, previously Waimea Falls Park).<ref name=\"OHA Waimia Valley press release\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oha.org/content.asp?contentid=561 |title=OHA gains Waimea Valley title |first=Manu |last=Boyd |date=July 3, 2006 |publisher=[[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]] |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927173615/http://www.oha.org/content.asp?contentid=561 |archivedate=September 27, 2006 |url-status= |accessdate=May 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBesides purchases since its inception, the lands initially given to OHA were originally crown lands of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi used to pay the expenses of the monarchy (later held by the Provisional Government following the fall of the monarchy in 1893). Upon the declaration of the Republic of Hawai\u02bbi, they were officially designated as public lands. They were ceded to federal control with the establishment of the [[Territory of Hawai\u02bbi]] in 1898, and finally returned to the State of Hawai\u02bbi as public lands in 1959.\n\nOHA is a semi-autonomous government body administered by a nine-member board of trustees, elected by the people of the State of Hawai\u02bbi through popular suffrage. Originally, trustees and the people eligible to vote for trustees were restricted to native Hawaiians. [[Rice v. Cayetano]]\u2014suing the state to allow non-Hawaiians to sit on the board of trustees, and for non-Hawaiians to be allowed to vote in trustee elections\u2014reached the [[United States Supreme Court]], which ruled in favor of Rice on February 23, 2000, forcing OHA to open its elections to all residents of the State of Hawai\u02bbi, regardless of ethnicity.\n\n==Federal developments==\n\n===Native American Programs Act===\nIn 1974, the Native American Programs Act was amended to include native Hawaiians. This paved the way for native Hawaiians to become eligible for some, but not all, federal assistance programs originally intended for [[Native Americans in the United States|Continental Native Americans]]. Today, Title 45 CFR Part 1336.62 defines a Native Hawaiian as \"an individual any of whose ancestors were natives of the area which consists of the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778\".\n\nThere is some controversy as to whether or not native Hawaiians should be considered in the same light as Native Americans.<ref name=\"Indian Country Today\">{{cite journal |author=Editors Report |date=August 13, 2001 |title=Native Hawaiian recognition is overdue |journal=[[Indian Country Today]] |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network |id={{oclc|61312545|43291273}} |issn=0744-2238 |accessdate=May 19, 2012 |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ictarchives/2001/08/13/native-hawaiian-recognition-is-overdue-84826 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025002449/http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=73 |archivedate=October 25, 2006 |url-status=live |quote=Native Hawaiians have rightfully demanded recognition of their aboriginal standing by the United States.}}</ref><ref name=conklin>{{cite web|url=http://kenconklin.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Are_kanaka_maoli_indigenous_to_Hawai%27i%3F|title=Are kanaka maoli indigenous to Hawai'i?|work=kenconklin.org|accessdate=June 16, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082145/http://kenconklin.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Are_kanaka_maoli_indigenous_to_Hawai%27i%3F|archivedate=May 1, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===United States apology resolution===\nOn November 23, 1993, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] signed United States Public Law 103\u2013150, also known as the [[Apology Resolution]], which had previously passed Congress.

The significance of the bill is that it would establish, for the first time in the history of the islands, a new political and legal relationship between a Native Hawaiian entity and the federal government. This Native Hawaiian entity would be a newly created one without any historical precedent in the islands, or direct institutional continuity with previous political entities (unlike many Native American Indian groups, for example).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThis bill came under scrutiny by the Bush administration's Department of Justice, as well as the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. The political context surrounding the Akaka Bill is both controversial and complex. Proponents, who consider the legislation an acknowledgement and partial correction of past injustices, include Hawai\u02bbi's Congressional delegation, as well as the former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor, [[Linda Lingle]]. Opponents include the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, (who question the constitutionality of creating race-based governments), libertarian activists, (who challenge the historical accuracy of any claims of injustice), and other Native [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement|Hawaiian sovereignty activists]], (who feel the legislation would thwart their hopes for complete independence from the United States).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nA Ward Research poll commissioned in 2003 by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs reported that \"Eighty-six percent of the 303 Hawaiian residents polled by Ward Research said 'yes.'

The inaugural director of Ka Huli Ao is Honolulu attorney [http://www.law.hawaii.edu/personnel/mackenzie/melody Melody Kapilialoha MacKenzie]. MacKenzie is also recognized as the chief editor of the Native Hawaiian Rights Handbook, which is a legal publication that describes Native Hawaiian law, a subset of laws of the State of Hawai\u02bbi. MacKenzie worked as a clerk to the school of law\u02bbs namesake, William S. Richardson, for four years, and also served as the Executive Director of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation for four years, then worked as a senior staff attorney for another six years.\n\nKa Huli Ao focuses on research, scholarship, and community outreach. Ka Huli Ao provides a monthly lunch-time discussion forum referred to as ''Maoli Thursday'', which is free and open to the public. Ka Huli Ao maintains its own [http://uhm-nativehawaiianlaw.blogspot.com/ blog], as well as a Twitter account and a Facebook group. Ka Huli Ao also provides law students with summer fellowships. Law school graduates are eligible to apply for post-J.D. fellowships that last for one year.\n\n==Notable Native Hawaiians==\n{{main|List of Native Hawaiians}}\n\nIn 1873 the first native Hawaiians were given permission from [[King Lunalilo]] (prior emigration of native Hawaiians was not allowed) to permanently emigrate to the United States (Salt Lake City, Utah) whose names were Kiha Kaawa, and Kahana Pukahi. Kiha was adopted by Mormon Missionary President George Nebeker immediately upon arrival making Kiha Kaawa (Nebeker) the first native Hawaiian to become a US citizen in 1873.\n\n==Culture and arts==\n{{main|Culture of the Native Hawaiians}}\n[[File:Native Hawaiian man pounding taro into poi with two children by his sides., c. 1890s.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Hawaiian man with his two children, circa 1890.]]\nSeveral cultural preservation societies and organizations have been established over the course of the twentieth century. The largest of those institutions is the Bernice Pauahi [[Bishop Museum]], established in 1889 and designated as the Hawai\u02bbi State Museum of Natural and Cultural History. Bishop Museum houses the largest collection of native Hawaiian artifacts, documents, and other information available for educational use. Most objects are held for preservation alone. The museum has links with major colleges and universities throughout the world to facilitate research.\n\nWith the support of the Bishop Museum, the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]'s double-hulled canoe, ''[[Hokulea|H\u014dk\u016ble&lsquo;a]]'', has contributed to rediscovery of native Hawaiian culture, especially in the revival of non-instrument navigation, by which ancient Polynesians originally settled Hawai\u02bbi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hawaiireef.noaa.gov/heritage/welcome.html|title=Hawaiian Cultural Heritage|last=Unattributed|date=July 25, 2007|work=Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument|publisher=United States [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|language=en-US, haw|accessdate=September 6, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916044123/http://www.hawaiireef.noaa.gov/heritage/welcome.html|archivedate=September 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}} Discusses ''H\u014dk\u016ble&lsquo;a's'' ''[[Hokulea#2003 - 2004 Navigating Change project|Navigating Change]]'' voyage which also raised consciousness of the interdependence of Hawaiians, their environment, and their culture.</ref>\n \nOne of the most commonly known arts of Hawaii is [[hula]] dancing. Now in  days in 21st century many people recognize the hula dance in two different categories which are Hula Kahiko and Hula Auana.\n\nHula Kahiko which is an \u201cold\u201d style of the hula dancing  which  is an interpretive dance, famous for its grace and romantic feel, that expresses stories and feeling from almost any phase of life & culture of Hawaiians. While dancing they also use percussion instruments and traditional chanting. Hawaiians make their own traditional instruments to use while the dancers are dancing which are: PAHU HULA, KILU or PUNIU, IPU, HANO or \u2018OHE HANO IHU, KA, PU, OEOE, PAHUPAHU or [[Ka'eke'eke|KA\u2019EKE\u2019EKE]], HOKIO, and WI. Dancers employ implements to create sounds. Some of the traditional hula implements are: \u2018ULI\u2019ULI, PU\u2019ILI, \u2018ILI\u2019ILI, PAPAHEHI,and KALA\u2019AU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kaimi.org/education/instruments/|title=Instruments {{!}} Ka'Imi Na'auao O Hawai'i Nei Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n\nHula Auana is a Hula that was changed by Western influences and performed with musical instruments that don't originate from the Hawaiian Islands. It was popularized and influenced by the influx of tourists to the Hawaiians Islands. The stories are told primarily with the movements of the body and hands. Musis, ukuleles and guitars to accompany the dancers, and the entire performance which makes it more entertaining for those who are new to the culture.

One of the most important holidays among the locals is Prince Kuhio day. Celebrated every year (since 1949) on his birthday (March 26), Prince Kuhio day honors Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole, a congressman who succeeded in helping Native Hawaiian families become public landowners.

A major factor for this change was an 1896 law that required that English \"be the only medium and basis of instruction in all public and private schools\". This law prevented the Hawaiian language from being taught as a second language.

The Hawaiian language has been promoted for revival most recently by a state program of cultural preservation enacted in 1978. Programs included the opening of Hawaiian language immersion schools, and the establishment of a Hawaiian language department at the [[University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa]]. As a result, Hawaiian language learning has climbed among all races in Hawai\u02bbi.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nIn 2006, the [[University of Hawaii at Hilo]] established a masters program in the Hawaiian Language.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1143838 Master's Degree in Hawaiian], npr.org</ref> In fall 2006, they established a doctoral ([[Ph.D]]) program in the Hawaiian Language.

In [[Hawaii]], native Hawaiians are publicly educated by the Hawai\u02bbi State [[Department of Education]], an ethnically diverse school system that is the United States' largest and most centralized.\n\nUnder the administration of Governor [[Benjamin J. Cayetano]] from 1994 to 2002, the state's educational system established special Hawaiian language immersion schools. In these schools, all subject courses are taught in the Hawaiian language and use native Hawaiian subject matter in curricula. These schools were created in the [[spirit]] of cultural preservation and are not exclusive to native Hawaiian children.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\nNative Hawaiians are eligible for an education from the [[Kamehameha Schools]], established through the last will and testament of [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]] of the [[House of Kamehameha|Kamehameha Dynasty]]. The largest and wealthiest [[private school]] in the United States, Kamehameha Schools was intended to benefit indigents and orphans, with preference given to native Hawaiians. The Kamehameha Schools provides a quality education to thousands of children of entire and part native Hawaiian ancestry at its campuses during the regular school year, and also has quality summer and off-campus programs that are not restricted by ancestry. Kamehameha Schools' practice of accepting primarily gifted students, in lieu of intellectually challenged children, has been a controversial topic amongst the native Hawaiian community. Many 'rejected' families feel that the gifted students could excel at any learning institution, public or private. Thus, the Hawaiian community may be better served by educating children from high-risk, high-crime districts so that a greater proportion of disadvantaged youths may grow up to be responsible community contributors.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAs with other children in Hawai\u02bbi, some native Hawaiians are educated by other prominent private academies in the Aloha State. They include: [[Punahou School]], [[Saint Louis School]], [[Mid-Pacific Institute]], and [[Iolani School]].\n\n==Native Hawaiian ways of learning==\n\nNative Hawaiians exemplify patterns of [[observational learning]], a model that captures seven interrelated descriptions, or facets, of learning found in Indigenous communities in the Americas.<ref name=\":0\">Rogoff, B.

Honolulu, HI: Hui Hanai.</ref>\n\n'''Learner collaboration and contribution'''\n\nSimilar to the indigenous communities of the Americas, Native Hawaiian children contribute alongside the adults, and the adults' presence is there to offer support. In most Native Hawaiian communities, household work tasks, such as ironing and cooking, etc., play a major role in contributing to the home life and children's participation enhances their importance within the family.<ref name=\":2\">Boggs, Joan. 1968.

Family organization is a \u201cshared-function\u201d system that includes flexible roles and fluid responsibility within the group. Basic family values include interdependence, responsibility for others, sharing of work and resources, obedience, and respect. Children assume important family responsibilities early and act as members of a sibling workforce that is held collectively responsible for completing tasks.<ref name=\":4\">G.

Children also scan to provide help to others when necessary. In this way, children shift between the roles of assisted and assistant. Adults were present and available, but the children were more often found to take the initiative to learn from, and teach, one another how to perform tasks such as sweeping, homework, and caring for younger siblings.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Learning to transform participation'''\n\nAmong Native Hawaiians, the goal of learning is to transform [[Youth participation|participation]] to encompass conscientious accountability as active contributing members of the community,<ref name=\":0\" /> like that found in [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]]. For example, in some Native Hawaiian communities, parent(s) teach the older siblings the necessary skills of care taking. Sibling care-taking skills can relate to indigenous American ways of learning by the children becoming considerate of their parents and taking on the responsibility when needed in case of a tragic incident with the parents.<ref>Cicirelli, V. (1994). Sibling Relationships in Cross-Cultural Perspective. Journal of Marriage and Family,56(1), 7-20. {{doi|10.2307/352697}}\n</ref> Within the classroom and home settings, adults are present but are not always directly monitoring the children. Children ask for help when necessary, but adults appear to rarely interject. Children appeared to adapt to tasks and situations by observations and go off on their own to collectively work out how and what to do to complete the task.\n\n[[Fosterage|Assuming and initiating care]] has been found across Polynesian cultures, and Native Hawaiian practices are in keeping with this trend. One study observed, interviewed, and evaluated families on the Polynesian Island Sikaiana and found that fostering children from other families within the community is a common shared endeavor that serves to construct relationships, support the community, and nurture compassion and sympathy [[Aloha|(''aloha'']]).<ref name=\":6\">Donner, W. W. (1999). Sharing and Compassion: Fosterage in a Polynesian Society. Journal of Comparative Family Studies, 30(4), autumn, 703-722. Retrieved May 25, 2017.</ref> As children mature within the family, they go through a process of having their needs attended and learn to provide and care for the younger children alongside the adults. Adolescent girls who are active caretakers are referred to as parents, even if there is no biological connection.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n'''Wide and keen attention for contribution'''\n\nThe Hawaiians\u2019 ways of learning include wide keen attention from the children while adults are available for guidance, also found in the model of [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]]. Children were found to learn from adults by participating in group activities where they had the chance to observe the performance of more experienced participants as well as having errors in their own performance corrected by more seasoned group members.<ref name=\":4\" /> Because the children [[Observational learning|learn through observation]], and then are encouraged to practice among their peers, we can speculate the children have keen attention to events around them, which is an expectation of adults and community members who are there to assist when needed.<ref name=\":3\" /> It has been observed that Hawaiian children were successful at completing tasks which greatly depend on visual and memory process skills, which coincides with Hawaiian mother's frequent use of non-verbal communication.<ref>Speidel, G. E., Farran, D. C., & Jordan, C. (1989). 6: On the Learning and Thinking Styles of Hawaiian Children. In Thinking Across Cultures (pp. 55-77). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref>\n\n'''Coordination through shared reference'''\n\nIn some Native Hawaiian communities, there is a constant use of [[Storytelling|\u201ctalk story\u201d]] which plays an essential role in promoting solidarity in the community by not overpowering or making the members of the community feel inadequate for not understanding something. Talk story can consist of recalled events, folktales, and joking. Joking can be used to tease and guide the children about how to do a chore better or to avoid serious trouble.<ref>Smith-Hefner, N. J. (1987), Speaking Relating and Learning: A Study of Hawaiian Children at Home and at School: Stephen T. Boggs. TESOL Quarterly, 21: 759\u2013763. {{doi|10.2307/3586993}}</ref> Talk story relates to an Indigenous way of learning by providing conversations such as narratives and dramatizations with verbal and nonverbal communication between the elder and children.\n\nAnother example of verbal communication in the Native Hawaiian culture is through the use of [[chant]]ing, which can allow a child to understand the relationship of their present experiences to those of their ancestors, both alive and deceased. Chanting also allows children to understand the connections of their chants to mother earth. For instance, chanting can voice the need for rain to produce plants and induce ponds to grow fish for harvest.<ref name=\":5\">Meyer, Manu Aluli (1998) Native Hawaiian Epistemology: Sites of Empowerment and Resistance, Equity & Excellence in Education, 31:1, 22-28, {{DOI|10.1080/1066568980310104}}</ref>\n\nA study comparing Midwestern and Hawaiian mother \u2013 Kindergartener pairs presented with a novel task,<ref name=\":4\" /> found Hawaiian mothers to be much lower than their Midwestern counterparts in the use of verbal-control techniques and much higher in non-verbal communication, a finding which implies coordination through [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] and verbal means.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Aspects of togetherness, continuity, purpose, and significance are a part of learning and coincide with the Native Hawaiian's spiritual connection to earth and environment.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n'''Feedback that appraises mastery and support for learning'''\n\nThere is verbal and nonverbal guidance from parents to children with chores and other activities. For example, a pat on the shoulder can communicate to the child that he/she is doing the activity at hand the correct way.<ref name=\":2\" /> This example relates to the [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]] model by there being an appraisal from the parent(s) in order to support their progress in learning and contributing better in the community. As the child gradually advances towards more complex tasks, the goal of mastery and feedback on the adequacy of their contributions become more pronounced.\n\nIn the context of producing objects e.g. baskets, mats, or quilts, there was a belief that a child must produce a perfect end-product before moving on to learn the skills of producing something else. Perfection in these products was judged by more experienced craftspeople and was attained by repeated attempts interspersed with feedback.

At the convention, the Hawai\u02bbi state government committed itself to a progressive study and preservation of native Hawaiian culture, history, and language.\n\nA comprehensive Hawaiian culture curriculum was introduced into the State of Hawai\u02bbi's public elementary schools teaching: ancient Hawaiian art, lifestyle, geography, [[hula]], and Hawaiian language vocabulary. Intermediate and high schools were mandated to impose two sets of Hawaiian history curricula on every candidate for graduation.\n\nStatutes and charter amendments were passed acknowledging a policy of preference for Hawaiian place and street names. For example, with the closure of [[Barbers Point Naval Air Station]] in the 1990s, the region formerly occupied by the base was renamed [[Kalaeloa]].\n\n==Office of Hawaiian Affairs==\n{{main|Office of Hawaiian Affairs}}\nAnother important outgrowth of the 1978 Hawai\u02bbi State Constitutional Convention was the establishment of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, more popularly known as OHA. Delegates that included future Hawai\u02bbi political stars [[Benjamin J. Cayetano]], [[John D. Waihee III]], and [[Jeremy Harris (politician)|Jeremy Harris]] enacted measures intended to address injustices toward native Hawaiians since the [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi]] in 1893. OHA was established as a trust, administered with a mandate to better the conditions of both native Hawaiians and the Hawaiian community in general. OHA was given control over certain public lands, and continues to expand its land-holdings to this day (most recently with Waimea Valley, previously Waimea Falls Park).<ref name=\"OHA Waimia Valley press release\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oha.org/content.asp?contentid=561 |title=OHA gains Waimea Valley title |first=Manu |last=Boyd |date=July 3, 2006 |publisher=[[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]] |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927173615/http://www.oha.org/content.asp?contentid=561 |archivedate=September 27, 2006 |url-status= |accessdate=May 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBesides purchases since its inception, the lands initially given to OHA were originally crown lands of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi used to pay the expenses of the monarchy (later held by the Provisional Government following the fall of the monarchy in 1893). Upon the declaration of the Republic of Hawai\u02bbi, they were officially designated as public lands. They were ceded to federal control with the establishment of the [[Territory of Hawai\u02bbi]] in 1898, and finally returned to the State of Hawai\u02bbi as public lands in 1959.\n\nOHA is a semi-autonomous government body administered by a nine-member board of trustees, elected by the people of the State of Hawai\u02bbi through popular suffrage. Originally, trustees and the people eligible to vote for trustees were restricted to native Hawaiians. [[Rice v. Cayetano]]\u2014suing the state to allow non-Hawaiians to sit on the board of trustees, and for non-Hawaiians to be allowed to vote in trustee elections\u2014reached the [[United States Supreme Court]], which ruled in favor of Rice on February 23, 2000, forcing OHA to open its elections to all residents of the State of Hawai\u02bbi, regardless of ethnicity.\n\n==Federal developments==\n\n===Native American Programs Act===\nIn 1974, the Native American Programs Act was amended to include native Hawaiians. This paved the way for native Hawaiians to become eligible for some, but not all, federal assistance programs originally intended for [[Native Americans in the United States|Continental Native Americans]]. Today, Title 45 CFR Part 1336.62 defines a Native Hawaiian as \"an individual any of whose ancestors were natives of the area which consists of the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778\".\n\nThere is some controversy as to whether or not native Hawaiians should be considered in the same light as Native Americans.<ref name=\"Indian Country Today\">{{cite journal |author=Editors Report |date=August 13, 2001 |title=Native Hawaiian recognition is overdue |journal=[[Indian Country Today]] |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network |id={{oclc|61312545|43291273}} |issn=0744-2238 |accessdate=May 19, 2012 |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ictarchives/2001/08/13/native-hawaiian-recognition-is-overdue-84826 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025002449/http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=73 |archivedate=October 25, 2006 |url-status=live |quote=Native Hawaiians have rightfully demanded recognition of their aboriginal standing by the United States.}}</ref><ref name=conklin>{{cite web|url=http://kenconklin.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Are_kanaka_maoli_indigenous_to_Hawai%27i%3F|title=Are kanaka maoli indigenous to Hawai'i?|work=kenconklin.org|accessdate=June 16, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082145/http://kenconklin.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Are_kanaka_maoli_indigenous_to_Hawai%27i%3F|archivedate=May 1, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===United States apology resolution===\nOn November 23, 1993, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] signed United States Public Law 103\u2013150, also known as the [[Apology Resolution]], which had previously passed Congress.

The significance of the bill is that it would establish, for the first time in the history of the islands, a new political and legal relationship between a Native Hawaiian entity and the federal government. This Native Hawaiian entity would be a newly created one without any historical precedent in the islands, or direct institutional continuity with previous political entities (unlike many Native American Indian groups, for example).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThis bill came under scrutiny by the Bush administration's Department of Justice, as well as the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. The political context surrounding the Akaka Bill is both controversial and complex. Proponents, who consider the legislation an acknowledgement and partial correction of past injustices, include Hawai\u02bbi's Congressional delegation, as well as the former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor, [[Linda Lingle]]. Opponents include the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, (who question the constitutionality of creating race-based governments), libertarian activists, (who challenge the historical accuracy of any claims of injustice), and other Native [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement|Hawaiian sovereignty activists]], (who feel the legislation would thwart their hopes for complete independence from the United States).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nA Ward Research poll commissioned in 2003 by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs reported that \"Eighty-six percent of the 303 Hawaiian residents polled by Ward Research said 'yes.'

The inaugural director of Ka Huli Ao is Honolulu attorney [http://www.law.hawaii.edu/personnel/mackenzie/melody Melody Kapilialoha MacKenzie]. MacKenzie is also recognized as the chief editor of the Native Hawaiian Rights Handbook, which is a legal publication that describes Native Hawaiian law, a subset of laws of the State of Hawai\u02bbi. MacKenzie worked as a clerk to the school of law\u02bbs namesake, William S. Richardson, for four years, and also served as the Executive Director of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation for four years, then worked as a senior staff attorney for another six years.\n\nKa Huli Ao focuses on research, scholarship, and community outreach. Ka Huli Ao provides a monthly lunch-time discussion forum referred to as ''Maoli Thursday'', which is free and open to the public. Ka Huli Ao maintains its own [http://uhm-nativehawaiianlaw.blogspot.com/ blog], as well as a Twitter account and a Facebook group. Ka Huli Ao also provides law students with summer fellowships. Law school graduates are eligible to apply for post-J.D. fellowships that last for one year.\n\n==Notable Native Hawaiians==\n{{main|List of Native Hawaiians}}\n\nIn 1873 the first native Hawaiians were given permission from [[King Lunalilo]] (prior emigration of native Hawaiians was not allowed) to permanently emigrate to the United States (Salt Lake City, Utah) whose names were Kiha Kaawa, and Kahana Pukahi. Kiha was adopted by Mormon Missionary President George Nebeker immediately upon arrival making Kiha Kaawa (Nebeker) the first native Hawaiian to become a US citizen in 1873.\n\n==Culture and arts==\n{{main|Culture of the Native Hawaiians}}\n[[File:Native Hawaiian man pounding taro into poi with two children by his sides., c. 1890s.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Hawaiian man with his two children, circa 1890.]]\nSeveral cultural preservation societies and organizations have been established over the course of the twentieth century. The largest of those institutions is the Bernice Pauahi [[Bishop Museum]], established in 1889 and designated as the Hawai\u02bbi State Museum of Natural and Cultural History. Bishop Museum houses the largest collection of native Hawaiian artifacts, documents, and other information available for educational use. Most objects are held for preservation alone. The museum has links with major colleges and universities throughout the world to facilitate research.\n\nWith the support of the Bishop Museum, the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]'s double-hulled canoe, ''[[Hokulea|H\u014dk\u016ble&lsquo;a]]'', has contributed to rediscovery of native Hawaiian culture, especially in the revival of non-instrument navigation, by which ancient Polynesians originally settled Hawai\u02bbi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hawaiireef.noaa.gov/heritage/welcome.html|title=Hawaiian Cultural Heritage|last=Unattributed|date=July 25, 2007|work=Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument|publisher=United States [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|language=en-US, haw|accessdate=September 6, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916044123/http://www.hawaiireef.noaa.gov/heritage/welcome.html|archivedate=September 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}} Discusses ''H\u014dk\u016ble&lsquo;a's'' ''[[Hokulea#2003 - 2004 Navigating Change project|Navigating Change]]'' voyage which also raised consciousness of the interdependence of Hawaiians, their environment, and their culture.</ref>\n \nOne of the most commonly known arts of Hawaii is [[hula]] dancing. Now in  days in 21st century many people recognize the hula dance in two different categories which are Hula Kahiko and Hula Auana.\n\nHula Kahiko which is an \u201cold\u201d style of the hula dancing  which  is an interpretive dance, famous for its grace and romantic feel, that expresses stories and feeling from almost any phase of life & culture of Hawaiians. While dancing they also use percussion instruments and traditional chanting. Hawaiians make their own traditional instruments to use while the dancers are dancing which are: PAHU HULA, KILU or PUNIU, IPU, HANO or \u2018OHE HANO IHU, KA, PU, OEOE, PAHUPAHU or [[Ka'eke'eke|KA\u2019EKE\u2019EKE]], HOKIO, and WI. Dancers employ implements to create sounds. Some of the traditional hula implements are: \u2018ULI\u2019ULI, PU\u2019ILI, \u2018ILI\u2019ILI, PAPAHEHI,and KALA\u2019AU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kaimi.org/education/instruments/|title=Instruments {{!}} Ka'Imi Na'auao O Hawai'i Nei Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n\nHula Auana is a Hula that was changed by Western influences and performed with musical instruments that don't originate from the Hawaiian Islands. It was popularized and influenced by the influx of tourists to the Hawaiians Islands. The stories are told primarily with the movements of the body and hands. Musis, ukuleles and guitars to accompany the dancers, and the entire performance which makes it more entertaining for those who are new to the culture. Traditionally, hula was a religious ritualistic dance that was more about honoring the gods and goddesses than about entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/healthy-living/fitness/history-hula-dance/|title=The History Of The Hula Dance|website=EverydayHealth.com|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Hawaiian people have various traditions and holidays they celebrate annually. One of the most important holidays among the locals is Prince Kuhio day. Celebrated every year (since 1949) on his birthday (March 26), Prince Kuhio day honors Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole, a congressman who succeeded in helping Native Hawaiian families become public landowners.

If no ranking can be determined, a decision shall be obtained by EHF through drawing of lots.\n\n==Groups==\nThe matchdays will be 8\u20139 February, 15\u201316 February, 22\u201323 February, 29 February\u20131 March 2020, 21\u201322 March and 28\u201329 March 2020.\n\nThe European Handball Federation announced on 13 March 2020, that the EHF Cup group stage matches round 5 and 6 (21 to 22 and 28 to 29 March) matches will not be held as scheduled due to the ongoing developments in the spread of [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19]] across Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohandball.com/article/34361|title=Information on EHF competition matches in March and April|date=13 March 2020|work=eurohandball.com}}</ref>On 25 March, the EHF announced that no matches will be played before June due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohandball.com/article/34372|title=EHF presents feasibility study for potential re-start of European handball|date=25 March 2020|work=eurohandball.com}}</ref> On 24 April 2020 the matches were cancelled.<ref name=Cancelled>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohandball.com/article/34423|title=Information on the future of the European handball season 2019/20|date=24 April 2020|work=eurohandball.com}}</ref>\n\n===Group A===\n{{2019\u201320 EHF Cup group table|Group A|show_matches=no|only_pld_pts=no_hide_class_rules}}\n\n{{handballbox\n|id=\"Group A 1 v 3\"\n|date=9 February 2020\n|time=15:00\n|team1=[[MT Melsungen]] {{flagicon|GER}}\n|score=26\u201321\n|team2={{flagicon|POL}} [[Gwardia Opole]]\n|report=[http://europeancup.eurohandball.com/ehfc/en/2019-20/men/matches/202011020804001 Report]\n|goals1=[[Dimitri Ignatow|Ignatow]] 5\n|goals2=[[Patryk Mauer|Mauer]] 7\n|HT=12\u201310\n|twomin1=3\n|yellow1=2\n|red1=1\n|twomin2=7\n|yellow2=2\n|red2=\n|stadium=[[:de:Rothenbach-Halle|Rothenbach-Halle]], [[Kassel]]\n|attendance=2,786\n|referee=Budz\u00e1k, Z\u00e1hradn\u00edk\n|refnat=SVK\n}}\n{{handballbox\n|id=\"Group A 2 v 4\"\n|date=9 February 2020\n|time=15:00\n|team1=[[Bjerringbro-Silkeborg]] {{flagicon|DEN}}\n|score=24\u201333\n|team2={{flagicon|POR}} [[S.L.

After completion of the group stage, if two or more teams had scored the same number of points, the ranking will be determined as follows:\n\n#Highest number of points in matches between the teams directly involved;\n#Superior goal difference in matches between the teams directly involved;\n#Highest number of goals scored in matches between the teams directly involved (or in the away match in case of a two-team tie);\n#Superior goal difference in all matches of the group;\n#Highest number of plus goals in all matches of the group;\nIf the ranking of one of these teams is determined, the above criteria are consecutively followed until the ranking of all teams is determined. If no ranking can be determined, a decision shall be obtained by EHF through drawing of lots.\n\n==Groups==\nThe matchdays will be 8\u20139 February, 15\u201316 February, 22\u201323 February, 29 February\u20131 March 2020, 21\u201322 March and 28\u201329 March 2020.\n\nThe European Handball Federation announced on 13 March 2020, that the EHF Cup group stage matches round 5 and 6 (21 to 22 and 28 to 29 March) matches will not be held as scheduled due to the ongoing developments in the spread of [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19]] across Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohandball.com/article/34361|title=Information on EHF competition matches in March and April|date=13 March 2020|work=eurohandball.com}}</ref>On 25 March, the EHF announced that no matches will be played before June due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohandball.com/article/34372|title=EHF presents feasibility study for potential re-start of European handball|date=25 March 2020|work=eurohandball.com}}</ref> On 24 April 2020 the matches were cancelled.<ref name=Cancelled>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohandball.com/article/34423|title=Information on the future of the European handball season 2019/20|date=24 April 2020|work=eurohandball.com}}</ref>\n\n===Group A===\n{{2019\u201320 EHF Cup group table|Group A|show_matches=no|only_pld_pts=no_hide_class_rules}}\n\n{{handballbox\n|id=\"Group A 1 v 3\"\n|date=9 February 2020\n|time=15:00\n|team1=[[MT Melsungen]] {{flagicon|GER}}\n|score=26\u201321\n|team2={{flagicon|POL}} [[Gwardia Opole]]\n|report=[http://europeancup.eurohandball.com/ehfc/en/2019-20/men/matches/202011020804001 Report]\n|goals1=[[Dimitri Ignatow|Ignatow]] 5\n|goals2=[[Patryk Mauer|Mauer]] 7\n|HT=12\u201310\n|twomin1=3\n|yellow1=2\n|red1=1\n|twomin2=7\n|yellow2=2\n|red2=\n|stadium=[[:de:Rothenbach-Halle|Rothenbach-Halle]], [[Kassel]]\n|attendance=2,786\n|referee=Budz\u00e1k, Z\u00e1hradn\u00edk\n|refnat=SVK\n}}\n{{handballbox\n|id=\"Group A 2 v 4\"\n|date=9 February 2020\n|time=15:00\n|team1=[[Bjerringbro-Silkeborg]] {{flagicon|DEN}}\n|score=24\u201333\n|team2={{flagicon|POR}} [[S.L.

It is owned and operated by [[iHeartMedia]] and broadcasts a [[classic rock]] music format. KGB-FM's studios are located in San Diego's [[Kearny Mesa, San Diego|Kearny Mesa]] neighborhood on the northeast side, and the transmitter is located in East San Diego east of [[Balboa Park, San Diego|Balboa Park]].\n\nThe station has broadcast using the [[HD Radio]] digital transmission format since 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sbe36.org/2007/01/san-diego-hd-radio/ |title=San Diego HD-Radio Progress Report }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n:''See [[KLSD#History]] for the history of the letters 'KGB' used as a radio station name.''\nThe 101.5&nbsp;MHz FM frequency originally [[sign-on|signed on]] the air in 1950 as '''KSON-FM''', owned by Fred Rabel. It is the second-oldest FM station in San Diego; the former KFSD-FM (now [[KMYI]]) at 94.1 FM debuted in 1948. Rabel later sold the signal to Brown Broadcasting in 1958. KSON-FM was moved off the KSON AM tower on the corner of [[California State Route 15|Highway 15]] and [[Interstate 5]], to the new site of sister station KGB (1360 AM, now [[KLSD]]) at 52nd Street and Kalmia. KSON-FM's call letters were changed to '''KGB-FM'''. In 1964, Brown Broadcasting hired [[Bill Drake]] to consult for the new KGB as the format he installed there later became known as \"[[Boss Radio]]\". In 1964, KGB and KGB-FM were separated, and the latter became '''KBKB''', a [[beautiful music]] station.\n\nBy 1972, Boss Radio on KGB was failing and more focus was being given to KBKB. Brown Broadcasting hired Ron Jacobs to turn around the FM station. Jacobs' first move was to restore the '''KGB-FM''' call letters and to drop Boss Radio from 1360 AM. Jacobs created San Diego's first-ever freeform progressive [[album-oriented rock]] FM superstation, further nurtured by station general manager Sonny Jim Price. Among the innovations introduced during this era of KGB-FM is the station's iconic mascot, the \"KGB Chicken\" (now known as the \"San Diego Chicken\"), a series of records called the ''Homegrown'' albums, and the \"Sky Show\", a fireworks display set to rock music.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Billboard-IDX/IDX/80s/1983/BB-1983-11-12-OCR-Page-0012.pdf |last=Arnold |first=Thomas K. |title=Price Steps Down From GM Post At KGB/KPQP |magazine=Billboard |page=12 |date=November 12, 1983 |access-date=June 1, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nKGB-FM has hosted many of San Diego's most prominent radio and television personalities. Such hosts include Lawrence \"Larry The Cruiser\" Himmel, Bob \"B.C.\" Coburn, Dave Benson, Damian Bragdon, Gabriel Wisdom, Erik Thompson, Jim McInnes, Ricky Leibert, Patrick Martin, Larry Bruce, Bill Hergonson, Ernesto Gladden, Ted Edwards, Linda McInnes, Digby Welch, [[Kevin McKeown (politician)|Kevin McKeown]], Pamela Edwards, Brian Schock, Susan Hemphill, Johnny Leslie, Andrew \"Long Tall Andy\" Geller, Blair and Kymythy Schultz, Philip Hendrie, Jeffrey Prescott, Michael Berger, Sue Delaney, Coe Lewis, \"Steve-o\", Cindy Spicer, Ted \"The Chicken\" Giannoulas, and Mojo Nixon. KGB-FM news anchors include Bradley Messer, Brent Seltzer, with Gerry Gazlay, and George Wilson.\n\nOne prominent longtime fixture on KGB-FM, and on San Diego rock radio in general, is ''The DSC Show''. The [[morning zoo]] program, hosted by Dave Rickards, Shelly Dunn, and Cookie \"Chainsaw\" Randolph, debuted on KGB-FM in 1990 as ''The Dawn Patrol''. In 1994, the program moved to [[KIOZ]] (originally at 102.1 FM, now at 105.3), where it was renamed ''The Dave, Shelly and Chainsaw Show'' and aired for three years.

Ted then a student at [[San Diego State University]] was hired to wear a chicken outfit for a promotion to distribute both 1360 KGB and KGB-FM 101 [[Easter egg]]s to children at the [[San Diego Wild Animal Park]]. The KGB-FM 101 Chicken whose wacky but fun antics entertained steadily larger crowds, moved on to features at concerts and sporting events, including appearances at more than 520 consecutive [[San Diego Padres]] baseball games. Conflict emerged however between the station and Ted and he was dismissed in 1977.

The show has become a very well attended annual event with fans viewing from both inside the stadium and outside, tailgating in the parking lot or from vantage points along Mission Valley's canyon rim. The KGB Sky Show also introduced the use of Rock and Roll music, multimedia, video, theatrical lighting and effects to enhance the fireworks display. According to its creator Rick Leibert, Sky Show is \"continuing experiment blending the ancient art of fireworks with rock and roll\".

KGB-FM's studios are located in San Diego's [[Kearny Mesa, San Diego|Kearny Mesa]] neighborhood on the northeast side, and the transmitter is located in East San Diego east of [[Balboa Park, San Diego|Balboa Park]].\n\nThe station has broadcast using the [[HD Radio]] digital transmission format since 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sbe36.org/2007/01/san-diego-hd-radio/ |title=San Diego HD-Radio Progress Report }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n:''See [[KLSD#History]] for the history of the letters 'KGB' used as a radio station name.''\nThe 101.5&nbsp;MHz FM frequency originally [[sign-on|signed on]] the air in 1950 as '''KSON-FM''', owned by Fred Rabel. It is the second-oldest FM station in San Diego; the former KFSD-FM (now [[KMYI]]) at 94.1 FM debuted in 1948. Rabel later sold the signal to Brown Broadcasting in 1958. KSON-FM was moved off the KSON AM tower on the corner of [[California State Route 15|Highway 15]] and [[Interstate 5]], to the new site of sister station KGB (1360 AM, now [[KLSD]]) at 52nd Street and Kalmia. KSON-FM's call letters were changed to '''KGB-FM'''. In 1964, Brown Broadcasting hired [[Bill Drake]] to consult for the new KGB as the format he installed there later became known as \"[[Boss Radio]]\". In 1964, KGB and KGB-FM were separated, and the latter became '''KBKB''', a [[beautiful music]] station.\n\nBy 1972, Boss Radio on KGB was failing and more focus was being given to KBKB. Brown Broadcasting hired Ron Jacobs to turn around the FM station. Jacobs' first move was to restore the '''KGB-FM''' call letters and to drop Boss Radio from 1360 AM. Jacobs created San Diego's first-ever freeform progressive [[album-oriented rock]] FM superstation, further nurtured by station general manager Sonny Jim Price. Among the innovations introduced during this era of KGB-FM is the station's iconic mascot, the \"KGB Chicken\" (now known as the \"San Diego Chicken\"), a series of records called the ''Homegrown'' albums, and the \"Sky Show\", a fireworks display set to rock music.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Billboard-IDX/IDX/80s/1983/BB-1983-11-12-OCR-Page-0012.pdf |last=Arnold |first=Thomas K. |title=Price Steps Down From GM Post At KGB/KPQP |magazine=Billboard |page=12 |date=November 12, 1983 |access-date=June 1, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nKGB-FM has hosted many of San Diego's most prominent radio and television personalities.

Released on 11 May 2011, it underperformed at the box office but received a positive critical reception, with particular praise for Cornish's direction and Boyega's performance, and several international accolades.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/movies/attack-the-block-review.html|title=Inner City vs. Outer Space|first=Jeannette|last=Catsoulis|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=11 August 2018|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nSamantha Adams, a trainee [[nurse]], is mugged by a gang of teenage hoodlums: Pest, Dennis, Jerome, Biggz, and leader Moses. When a [[meteorite]] falls from the sky into a nearby car, Samantha escapes. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a small alien creature. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the dead animal to their acquaintance, [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] dealer Ron and his boss Hi-Hatz.\n\nMore objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site. However, they find these aliens are much larger and threatening. Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by two policemen accompanying Samantha, and Moses is arrested. The aliens follow Moses and maul the unarmed officers to death, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside a van. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives away, only to crash into Hi-Hatz's car. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz and his henchman.\n\nThe gang try to flee to Wyndham Tower, but are attacked by the aliens; Biggz is forced to hide and Pest is bitten in the leg. They find that Samantha lives in their building and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An alien bursts in and Moses kills it with a [[samurai sword]]. Realizing that the group was not lying about the creatures being extraterrestrial, Samantha joins them.\n\nThe gang moves upstairs to the flat owned by Tia, Dimples, Dionna, and Gloria, believing that their security gate will keep them safe. The aliens instead attack from outside, smashing through the windows and decapitating Dennis. The girls believe them to be the focus of the creatures and kick them out of the flat. Hi-Hatz and two more henchmen attack the gang, but an alien arrives and chases Hi-Hatz and the henchmen into a lift.\n\nMaking their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang runs into more aliens, but using fireworks as a distraction, they manage to get through. Jerome becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat, they find that Hi-Hatz waiting for them there. Hi-Hatz prepares to shoot Moses, but multiple aliens break through the window and kill him. They are now joined by Brewis, one of Ron's customers and a zoology student. Moses, Pest and Samantha retreat into the weed room, while Ron hides in the flat.\n\nIn the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent stain on Moses' jacket under the [[ultraviolet]] light. Brewis theorises that the aliens are like [[spore]]s, drifting through space on [[solar wind]]s until they chance on a [[habitable planet]]. After landing in an area with enough food, the female lets off a strong [[pheromone]] to attract the male creatures so that they can mate and propagate their species. The gang form a plan for Samantha, who has not been stained with the pheromone, to go to Moses's flat and turn on the gas oven.\n\nSamantha successfully avoids the aliens and turns on the gas, learning to her surprise that the intimidating Moses is only 15. She leaves the block and Moses, with the body of the small alien strapped to his back, runs to the gas filled apartment with all of the aliens following him. He throws the dead small alien into the apartment, and then using fireworks he ignites the gas-filled room and leaps out of the window. In the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis, and Ron are arrested and held responsible for the deaths around the block. The police then ask Samantha to identify Moses and his friends as those who killed everyone, including the two police officers that had arrested Moses earlier. Instead Samantha corrects them by saying that all of the boys are her neighbours, and that they were the ones who protected her. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the block cheering for Moses.\n\n==Cast==\nRepresentative of the film's plot and location, most of the cast (many of whom spoke [[Multicultural London English]] during the film) were young, relative unknowns, and local to the area. According to the DVD's making-of featurette, the teenagers were selected from drama classes of London council estate schools, and then had to go through eight auditions before being offered a part.<ref>DVD \"making of\" featurette</ref>  John Boyega found out about this film from an ad placed on the internet. The cast includes:\n\n* [[John Boyega]] as Moses, a low level crook, teenage gang leader and orphan looking for respect around the block.\n* [[Jodie Whittaker]] as Samantha Adams, a trainee nurse and new resident of Wyndham Tower.\n* [[Alex Esmail]] as Pest, a teenage jokester, pyromaniac and second in command of Moses's gang. \n* [[Franz Drameh]] as Dennis, a hotheaded [[pizza delivery boy]] and the enforcer of the gang.\n* [[Leeon Jones]] as Jerome, a schoolboy and the most level headed member of the gang. \n* Simon Howard as Biggz, the youngest member of the gang.

The director wanted to counter the trend of '[[hoodie]] horror' films which demonised urban youths.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gallagher |first1=Paul |title=Cornish Nasties |url=https://archive.list.co.uk/the-list/2011-04-28/18/ |publisher=The List |accessdate=25 September 2019 |date=28 April 2011}}</ref> Cornish also based the character of the [[stoner (drug user)|stoner]] Brewis on himself in his twenties.\n\n===Filming===\n''Attack the Block'' is set in a fictional neighbourhood said in-film to be located in the [[London]] district of [[Brixton]]. It is actually a composite of various council estates across London. Director Cornish explains:\n<blockquote>\nWe wanted to stamp a clear layout on the audience's minds early, and since we couldn't afford to show an aerial shot of the estate as it doesn't exist, the way to show it was by showing this top shot of the map at the very beginning of the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Location |url=http://www.film4.com/features/article/location-attack-the-block |work=Attack the Block Minisite |publisher=Film 4 |accessdate=28 June 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe name Wyndham Estates appears on the left of the entrance to the fictional block, referencing the English science-fiction writer [[John Wyndham]]. The science fiction writer [[J. G. Ballard]] is also referenced by one of the street names; Ballard wrote a number of novels set in large urban blocks. The film was shot across London from March to May 2010, with six weeks of night shoots<ref>{{cite web|title=The Look |url=http://www.film4.com/features/article/the-look-attack-the-block |work=Attack the Block minisite |publisher=Film 4 |accessdate=28 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212045710/http://www.film4.com/features/article/the-look-attack-the-block |archivedate=12 December 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> on the [[Heygate Estate]] in [[Elephant and Castle]]; Myatts Field, Brixton; [[Oval tube station|Oval Underground station]] and the Bemerton Estate in [[Islington]].

the Block''''' is a 2011 British [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[comedy horror]] film written and directed by [[Joe Cornish]] and starring [[John Boyega]], [[Jodie Whittaker]], and [[Nick Frost]]. It was the film debut of Cornish, Boyega, and composer [[Steven Price (composer)|Steven Price]].\n\nThe film centres on a teenage [[street gang]] who have to defend themselves from predatory [[alien invader]]s on a [[Council house|council estate]] in [[South London]] on [[Guy Fawkes Night]]. Released on 11 May 2011, it underperformed at the box office but received a positive critical reception, with particular praise for Cornish's direction and Boyega's performance, and several international accolades.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/movies/attack-the-block-review.html|title=Inner City vs. Outer Space|first=Jeannette|last=Catsoulis|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=11 August 2018|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nSamantha Adams, a trainee [[nurse]], is mugged by a gang of teenage hoodlums: Pest, Dennis, Jerome, Biggz, and leader Moses. When a [[meteorite]] falls from the sky into a nearby car, Samantha escapes. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a small alien creature. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the dead animal to their acquaintance, [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] dealer Ron and his boss Hi-Hatz.\n\nMore objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site. However, they find these aliens are much larger and threatening. Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by two policemen accompanying Samantha, and Moses is arrested. The aliens follow Moses and maul the unarmed officers to death, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside a van. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives away, only to crash into Hi-Hatz's car. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz and his henchman.\n\nThe gang try to flee to Wyndham Tower, but are attacked by the aliens; Biggz is forced to hide and Pest is bitten in the leg. They find that Samantha lives in their building and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An alien bursts in and Moses kills it with a [[samurai sword]]. Realizing that the group was not lying about the creatures being extraterrestrial, Samantha joins them.\n\nThe gang moves upstairs to the flat owned by Tia, Dimples, Dionna, and Gloria, believing that their security gate will keep them safe. The aliens instead attack from outside, smashing through the windows and decapitating Dennis. The girls believe them to be the focus of the creatures and kick them out of the flat. Hi-Hatz and two more henchmen attack the gang, but an alien arrives and chases Hi-Hatz and the henchmen into a lift.\n\nMaking their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang runs into more aliens, but using fireworks as a distraction, they manage to get through. Jerome becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat, they find that Hi-Hatz waiting for them there. Hi-Hatz prepares to shoot Moses, but multiple aliens break through the window and kill him. They are now joined by Brewis, one of Ron's customers and a zoology student. Moses, Pest and Samantha retreat into the weed room, while Ron hides in the flat.\n\nIn the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent stain on Moses' jacket under the [[ultraviolet]] light. Brewis theorises that the aliens are like [[spore]]s, drifting through space on [[solar wind]]s until they chance on a [[habitable planet]]. After landing in an area with enough food, the female lets off a strong [[pheromone]] to attract the male creatures so that they can mate and propagate their species. The gang form a plan for Samantha, who has not been stained with the pheromone, to go to Moses's flat and turn on the gas oven.\n\nSamantha successfully avoids the aliens and turns on the gas, learning to her surprise that the intimidating Moses is only 15. She leaves the block and Moses, with the body of the small alien strapped to his back, runs to the gas filled apartment with all of the aliens following him. He throws the dead small alien into the apartment, and then using fireworks he ignites the gas-filled room and leaps out of the window. In the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis, and Ron are arrested and held responsible for the deaths around the block. The police then ask Samantha to identify Moses and his friends as those who killed everyone, including the two police officers that had arrested Moses earlier. Instead Samantha corrects them by saying that all of the boys are her neighbours, and that they were the ones who protected her. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the block cheering for Moses.\n\n==Cast==\nRepresentative of the film's plot and location, most of the cast (many of whom spoke [[Multicultural London English]] during the film) were young, relative unknowns, and local to the area. According to the DVD's making-of featurette, the teenagers were selected from drama classes of London council estate schools, and then had to go through eight auditions before being offered a part.<ref>DVD \"making of\" featurette</ref>  John Boyega found out about this film from an ad placed on the internet. The cast includes:\n\n* [[John Boyega]] as Moses, a low level crook, teenage gang leader and orphan looking for respect around the block.\n* [[Jodie Whittaker]] as Samantha Adams, a trainee nurse and new resident of Wyndham Tower.\n* [[Alex Esmail]] as Pest, a teenage jokester, pyromaniac and second in command of Moses's gang. \n* [[Franz Drameh]] as Dennis, a hotheaded [[pizza delivery boy]] and the enforcer of the gang.\n* [[Leeon Jones]] as Jerome, a schoolboy and the most level headed member of the gang. \n* Simon Howard as Biggz, the youngest member of the gang. Throughout most of the film, Biggz is trapped in a [[Dumpster|skip]] after he's cornered by the aliens.\n* [[Nick Frost]] as Ron, the local drug dealer who lives in the penthouse of Wyndham Tower and knows everyone.\n* [[Luke Treadaway]] as Brewis, a posh student stoner who's one of Ron's customers.\n* Jumayn Hunter as Hi-Hatz, the local psychopathic gangster who's Ron's feared boss and the true main antagonist.\n* Danielle Vitalis as Tia, a girl living in Wyndham Tower who's Moses's love interest and friend to the gang.\n* [[Paigey Cakey|Paige Meade]] as Dimples, Tia's quick tempered roommate who is also a friend to the gang.\n* Sammy Williams as Probs, a little kid who wishes to join Moses's gang.\n* Michael Ajao as Mayhem, Probs's best friend who shares his goal of joining Moses's gang.\n\n==Production==\n[[Big Talk Productions#Big Talk Pictures|Big Talk Pictures]], known for films including ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'', ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'', and ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. The World]]'', produced the film alongside [[Film4 Productions|Film4]], [[UK Film Council|The UK Film Council]], and [[StudioCanal]].<ref name= \"BFI\">{{cite web |title=Attack the Block|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b8dd444e3 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe plot was inspired by an event where the director was mugged himself, and after adding the science fiction angle into the plot, Joe Cornish interviewed various kids in youth groups in order to find out what kind of weapons they would use if a real alien invasion occurred. The director wanted to counter the trend of '[[hoodie]] horror' films which demonised urban youths.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gallagher |first1=Paul |title=Cornish Nasties |url=https://archive.list.co.uk/the-list/2011-04-28/18/ |publisher=The List |accessdate=25 September 2019 |date=28 April 2011}}</ref> Cornish also based the character of the [[stoner (drug user)|stoner]] Brewis on himself in his twenties.\n\n===Filming===\n''Attack the Block'' is set in a fictional neighbourhood said in-film to be located in the [[London]] district of [[Brixton]]. It is actually a composite of various council estates across London. Director Cornish explains:\n<blockquote>\nWe wanted to stamp a clear layout on the audience's minds early, and since we couldn't afford to show an aerial shot of the estate as it doesn't exist, the way to show it was by showing this top shot of the map at the very beginning of the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Location |url=http://www.film4.com/features/article/location-attack-the-block |work=Attack the Block Minisite |publisher=Film 4 |accessdate=28 June 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe name Wyndham Estates appears on the left of the entrance to the fictional block, referencing the English science-fiction writer [[John Wyndham]]. The science fiction writer [[J. G. Ballard]] is also referenced by one of the street names; Ballard wrote a number of novels set in large urban blocks. The film was shot across London from March to May 2010, with six weeks of night shoots<ref>{{cite web|title=The Look |url=http://www.film4.com/features/article/the-look-attack-the-block |work=Attack the Block minisite |publisher=Film 4 |accessdate=28 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212045710/http://www.film4.com/features/article/the-look-attack-the-block |archivedate=12 December 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> on the [[Heygate Estate]] in [[Elephant and Castle]]; Myatts Field, Brixton; [[Oval tube station|Oval Underground station]] and the Bemerton Estate in [[Islington]].

In total the film features over 100 effects shots, which were completed over the course of 4 months by Swedish effects house, Fido.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2011/06/09/creating-the-monsters-of-attack-the-block/#null|title=3D World magazine - Creative Bloq|publisher=}}</ref> The creatures have no eyes, and hunt and find mates using an extremely evolved sense of smell; their movement is enabled mainly through echolocation. According to the DVD commentary, the echolocation noises made by the creatures were a combination of [[dolphin]] [[sonar]] mixed digitally with the grunts and snarls of dozens of other animals, and even a woman screaming.<ref>DVD commentary track {{specify|date=February 2014}}<!-- time stamp? --></ref> Some [[puppet]]s were used, such as the smaller, hairless female alien which terrified the young cast.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Theatrical===\nStudioCanal's British distribution company [[Optimum Releasing]] released the film in the [[United Kingdom]] on 11 May 2011.
