The film tells the story of one frantic day in the lives of four Dublin software workers during the final months of Ireland's [[Celtic Tiger]] boom years. The film stars Lynette Callaghan, Art Kearns, Victor Burke and Jonathan Byrne. The film won several awards on the Irish film festival circuit, including Best Irish Feature Film at the International Film Festival Ireland in Clonmel (2009), Best Actress award for Lynette Callaghan at the Yellow Fever Independent Film Festival in Belfast (2009) and was awarded 2nd place in the Best Feature category at the Waterford Film Festival.\n\nThe film went on a limited Irish cinema release in January 2010 and was released on DVD throughout Ireland in November 2010. It was released on DVD and VOD in North America by the American distributor Breaking Glass Pictures in March 2011. The film was the first feature produced by the Irish production company Instigator Films.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in 2007 just before Ireland's [[Celtic Tiger]] was about to end and the plot intertwines the four parallel narratives of the lead characters; Rachel, Eoin, Frank and Tony. Their lives are linked as they all work together in the same office in a small Irish software company.\n \nRachel, played by Lynette Callaghan, is an ambitious marketing executive who on turning 30 appears to panic about what she perceives as her lack of achievement at a time of great economic opportunity. She becomes obsessed with an overpriced apartment in Dublin's prestigious [[Ballsbridge]] area and after a bruising opening scene where her boyfriend ends their relationship because she had a drunken one night stand, Rachel is determined to buy the apartment on her own at whatever cost. All closing bids for the apartment must be in by the end of the day so for most of the film, Rachel is preoccupied with a race-against-time to raise her salary to get a mortgage she can't afford. As she runs out of time, she becomes increasingly desperate and irrational and ends up blackmailing her boss to give her an unreasonable pay rise.\n\nEoin, played by Victor Burke is a [[computer programmer]] who is about to marry his fianc\u00e9e Lisa (played by Clodagh Reid). Initially he appears to be a very ordinary character who is becoming stressed about his impending marriage due to its spiraling costs as Lisa makes increasingly extravagant wedding arrangements. However, as this story unfolds, Eoin's character is revealed to have a history of bisexual encounters with other men. Simon, a handsome French man (played by French actor Frederic Ledoux) who seduced Eoin at a party the previous year, unexpectedly resurfaces and wants to meet Eoin that day for a coffee. The meeting with Simon puts Eoin on the spot as Simon confronts him about marrying and whether he prefers boys or girls.\n\nFrank, played by Art Kearns is a senior computer programmer in the company. His story is revealed quite late in the film. For most of the early section, he appears to be a grumpy, angry character who has some issue with his wife, and away from the eyes of his fellow workers, vents his anger by smashing a computer printer to pieces with his bare hands. He doesn't communicate much with the other characters and most of his story is internal and revealed through flashbacks as he mulls over the past. Eventually, it is revealed that he is troubled over his wife's uncomfortable fondness with his best friend David (played by Brendan McCormack).\n\nTony, played by Jonathan Byrne is a fun-loving, cocaine-sniffing [[Promiscuity|womaniser]] who casually shambles through his job in the software company. His story opens with a bawdy bedroom romp but as he can't even get the girl's name right, that soon ends in a row. Arriving late at work, Tony appears to be a happy-go-lucky type who never takes things too seriously. However, he is troubled by some strange, puzzling letters he has been receiving and after one is left at work, he visits a church to meet a bizarre old woman called Maggie (Geraldine Plunkett). She reveals that she is the mother of a girl he had an affair with the previous year who killed herself shortly afterwards. She accuses him of treating her badly. Tony denies the claims and storms off. For the rest of the day, Tony is deeply troubled by memories of not returning the girl's calls when she was clearly distressed and in the final scene of the film, Maggie shows up at his apartment to tell him a piece of very disturbing news.\n\n== Cast ==\n* Lynette Callaghan as Rachel.\n* Art Kearns as Frank.\n* Jonathan Byrne as Tony.\n* Victor Burke as Eoin.\n* Geraldine Plunkett as Maggie.\n* Tom O'Sullivan as Martin.\n* Gary Egan as Ian.\n\n==Production==\n''8.5 Hours'' was filmed entirely on location in [[Dublin]], [[Wicklow]] and [[County Meath|Meath]] in February and March 2007 with additional scenes and second unit material being shot in May and September of that year. The office of the software company featured in the film is an actual company office in [[Merrion Square]] in Dublin. After initial screenings of early edits at Irish film festivals (Galway Film Fleadh, Waterford Film Festival, Mid-Ulster Film Festival), a more advanced edit was shown at the Marche Du Film at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2009. This screening and subsequent meetings led to the film being distributed in the USA by Philadelphia-based distributor, Breaking Glass Pictures. Brian Lally was constantly tweaking the edit throughout 2009 as it appeared in more film festivals and the final edit was not completed until December 2009, just a few weeks before its Irish cinema release. The film was independently financed and produced on a very small budget of under 100,000 euro. Unusually, for a film that was released in Irish cinemas, it did not receive any funding from the [[Irish Film Board]]. It was shot on digital video, initially on the HDV format but then converted to High Definition for final editing and grading. A digital cinema print (JPEG 2000) was created for its Irish cinema release and it was one of the first Irish films to be released entirely digitally in Irish cinemas. The JPEG2000 cinema print was created by XDC Cinema in Belgium.\n\nThe film was released on DVD in Ireland in November 2010 and became the first ever Irish film DVD to carry the [[Guaranteed Irish]] logo. This branding device is used to help Irish consumers identify products which are produced in Ireland.\n\n==Reception==\nThe critical response to ''8.5 Hours'' was overwhelmingly negative.

The flowers are in small bunches of 2-5 in the axils of the leaves. They have 8 long green [[sepal]]s and 8 smaller, greenish-white [[petal]]s with several little bristles on the tip. The flowers are pollinated by insects and release a cloud of pollen when probed at the base by the insect's mouthparts. The seed does not detach itself from the flower stalk but germinates where it is and is known as a [[propagule]].

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing. At least one reported polio patient, [[Dianne Odell]], had a spinal deformity that caused the use of mechanical ventilators to be [[contraindicated]].<ref name=Sydney2008>{{cite news|author=|title=Power failure kills iron lung lady|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2008-05-29|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/world/power-failure-kills-iron-lung-lady/2008/05/29/1211654160059.html|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> There are patients who today still use the older machines, often in their homes, despite the occasional difficulty of finding the various replacement parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/60-years-iron-lung-us-polio-survivor-worries-about-new-2D11641456|title=60 years in an iron lung: US polio survivor worries about new global threat|publisher=}}</ref> Joan Headley of [[Post-Polio Health International]] said that as of May 28, 2008, there were about 30 patients in the U.S. still using an iron lung.<ref name=CNN2008>{{cite news|title=Woman dies after life spent in iron lung |date=May 28, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |accessdate=2011-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022162511/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 22, 2008 }}</ref> That figure may be inaccurately low; [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] alone had 19 iron lung patients living at home in 2008.<ref name=Neergaard2009>{{cite news|author=Lauran Neergaard|title=Emergency officials struggle to find those on life-support during power outages|date=2009-01-13|url=http://www.ems1.com/survivability/articles/447100-Emergency-officials-struggle-to-find-those-on-life-support-during-power-outages|accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref> [[Martha Mason (writer)|Martha Mason]] of [[Lattimore, North Carolina]], died on May 4, 2009, after spending 60 of her 72 years in an iron lung.<ref name=Fox2009>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Martha Mason, Who Wrote Book About Her Decades in an Iron Lung, Dies at 71|work=The New York Times|date=2009-05-10|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/us/10mason.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=iron%20lung&st=cse|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 October 2009, [[June Middleton]] of [[Melbourne, Australia]], who had been entered in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the person who spent the longest time in an iron lung, died aged 83, having spent more than 60 years in her iron lung.<ref name=Sydney2009>{{cite news|author=|title=Dead after 60 years in iron lung|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2009-11-01|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/dead-after-60-years-in-iron-lung-20091101-hqyy.html?autostart=1|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the [[Post-Polio Health International]] (PHI) organizations estimated that there were only six to eight iron lung users in the United States; as of 2017 its executive director knew of none.

Emerson defended himself by making the case that such lifesaving devices should be freely available to all.<ref name=NMAH2011/> Emerson also demonstrated that every aspect of Drinker's patents had been published or used by others at earlier times. Since an invention must be novel to be patentable, prior publication/use of the invention meant it was not novel and therefore unpatentable. Emerson won the case, and Drinker's patents were declared invalid.\n\nThe United Kingdom's first iron lung was designed in 1934 by Robert Henderson, an Aberdeen doctor. Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s, and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis. Despite this success, Henderson was reprimanded for secretly using hospital facilities to build the machine.<ref name=\"Wills\">{{cite book| last=Wills| first=Elspeth| title=Scottish Firsts: A Celebration of Innovation and Achievement| publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]| location=Edinburgh| year=2002| pages=[https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51 51\u20132]| isbn=978-1840186116| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web| last=Thomas| first=Campbell| date=15 February 2000| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/dr-robert-henderson-1.249085| title=Dr Robert Henderson | work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]| accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Both respirator==\n[[File:Both Cabinet Respirator in WWII.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Both cabinet respirator being used to treat a patient at the 110th Australian Military Hospital in 1943]]\n{{main|Both respirator}}\nThe [[Both respirator]], a negative pressure ventilator, was invented in 1937 when Australia's epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing. At least one reported polio patient, [[Dianne Odell]], had a spinal deformity that caused the use of mechanical ventilators to be [[contraindicated]].<ref name=Sydney2008>{{cite news|author=|title=Power failure kills iron lung lady|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2008-05-29|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/world/power-failure-kills-iron-lung-lady/2008/05/29/1211654160059.html|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> There are patients who today still use the older machines, often in their homes, despite the occasional difficulty of finding the various replacement parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/60-years-iron-lung-us-polio-survivor-worries-about-new-2D11641456|title=60 years in an iron lung: US polio survivor worries about new global threat|publisher=}}</ref> Joan Headley of [[Post-Polio Health International]] said that as of May 28, 2008, there were about 30 patients in the U.S. still using an iron lung.<ref name=CNN2008>{{cite news|title=Woman dies after life spent in iron lung |date=May 28, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |accessdate=2011-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022162511/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 22, 2008 }}</ref> That figure may be inaccurately low; [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] alone had 19 iron lung patients living at home in 2008.<ref name=Neergaard2009>{{cite news|author=Lauran Neergaard|title=Emergency officials struggle to find those on life-support during power outages|date=2009-01-13|url=http://www.ems1.com/survivability/articles/447100-Emergency-officials-struggle-to-find-those-on-life-support-during-power-outages|accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref> [[Martha Mason (writer)|Martha Mason]] of [[Lattimore, North Carolina]], died on May 4, 2009, after spending 60 of her 72 years in an iron lung.<ref name=Fox2009>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Martha Mason, Who Wrote Book About Her Decades in an Iron Lung, Dies at 71|work=The New York Times|date=2009-05-10|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/us/10mason.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=iron%20lung&st=cse|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 October 2009, [[June Middleton]] of [[Melbourne, Australia]], who had been entered in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the person who spent the longest time in an iron lung, died aged 83, having spent more than 60 years in her iron lung.<ref name=Sydney2009>{{cite news|author=|title=Dead after 60 years in iron lung|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2009-11-01|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/dead-after-60-years-in-iron-lung-20091101-hqyy.html?autostart=1|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the [[Post-Polio Health International]] (PHI) organizations estimated that there were only six to eight iron lung users in the United States; as of 2017 its executive director knew of none.

It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 by the combined armies of the [[Deccan sultanates]].

Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth.\n\nThe empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at [[Hampi]]. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the [[Vijayanagara Architecture]] style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in [[Hindu temples]]' construction.

Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the [[Vijayanagara Architecture]] style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in [[Hindu temples]]' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation.

While the empire's monuments are spread over the whole of Southern India, nothing surpasses the vast open-air theatre of monuments at its capital at [[Vijayanagara]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=\"Stones\">\"So intimate are the rocks and the monuments they were used for make, it was sometimes impossible to say where nature ended and art began\" (Art critic Percy Brown, quoted in ''Hampi, A Travel Guide'', p64)</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century the kings continued to build [[vesara]] or Deccan-style monuments but later incorporated Dravida-style [[gopura]]s to meet their ritualistic needs. The Prasanna Virupaksha temple (underground temple) of [[Bukka]] and the Hazare Rama temple of [[Deva Raya]] are examples of Deccan architecture.<ref name=\"deccan\">{{harvnb|Fritz|Michell|2001|p=9}}</ref> The varied and intricate ornamentation of the pillars is a mark of their work.<ref name=\"pillar\">Nilakanta Sastri about the importance of pillars in the Vijayanagar style in {{harvnb|Kamath|2001|p=183}}</ref> At Hampi, though the ''Vitthala'' temple is the best example of their pillared ''Kalyanamantapa'' style, the ''Hazara Ramaswamy'' temple is a modest but perfectly finished example.<ref name=\"Drama\">\"Drama in stone\" wrote art critic Percy Brown, much of the beauty of Vijayanagara architecture came from their pillars and piers and the styles of sculpting (''Hampi, A Travel Guide'', p77)</ref> A visible aspect of their style is their return to the simplistic and serene art developed by the Chalukya dynasty.<ref name=\"serene\">About the sculptures in Vijayanagara style, see {{harvnb|Kamath|2001|p=184}}</ref> A grand specimen of Vijayanagara art, the ''Vitthala'' temple, took several decades to complete during the reign of the [[Tuluva]] kings.<ref name=\"grand\">Several monuments are categorised as Tuluva art ({{harvnb|Fritz|Michell|2001|p=9}})</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Krishna Pushkarani - Hampi Ruins.jpg\n| width1 = 210\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Market place at [[Hampi]] and the sacred tank located near the Krishna temple.\n| image2 = The Stone Chariot,Hampi.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Stone [[temple car]] in the Vitthala Temple at Hampi.\n| footer = \n}}\nAnother element of the Vijayanagara style is the carving and consecration of large [[Monolithic architecture|monoliths]] such as the ''Sasivekaalu'' ([[mustard seed|mustard]]) [[Ganesha]] and ''Kadalekaalu'' ([[Peanut|ground nut]]) Ganesha at Hampi, the [[Gommateshwara]] ([[Bahubali]]) monoliths in [[Karkala]] and [[Venur]], and the [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] bull in [[Lepakshi]]. The Vijayanagara temples of [[Someshwara Temple, Kolar|Kolar]], [[Kanakachalapathi Temple, Kanakagiri|Kanakagiri]], [[Sringeri]] and other towns of Karnataka; the temples of [[Tadpatri]], [[Lepakshi]], [[Ahobilam]], [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]] and [[Srikalahasti]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]]; and the temples of [[Vellore]], [[Kumbakonam]], [[Kanchi]] and [[Srirangam]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] are examples of this style. Vijayanagara art includes wall-paintings such as the [[Dashavatara]] and ''Girijakalyana'' (marriage of [[Parvati]], Shiva's consort) in the [[Virupaksha Temple, Hampi|Virupaksha Temple]] at [[Hampi]], the ''Shivapurana'' murals (tales of Shiva) at the [[Virabhadra]] temple at [[Lepakshi]], and those at the Kamaakshi and Varadaraja temples at Kanchi.<ref name=\"paint\">Some of these paintings may have been redone in later centuries (Rajashekhar in {{harvnb|Kamath|2001|p=184}})</ref> This mingling of the South Indian styles resulted in a richness not seen in earlier centuries, a focus on [[relief]]s in addition to sculpture that surpasses that previously in India.<ref name=\"compliments\">Historians and art critics K.A.

While political history concentrates on the ongoing conflict between the Vijayanagara empire and the Deccan Sultanates, the architectural record reflects a more creative interaction. There are many [[arch]]es, [[dome]]s and [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] that show these influences. The concentration of structures like [[Chhatri|pavilions]], [[stable]]s and [[tower]]s suggests they were for use by royalty.<ref name=\"deccanstyle\">{{harvnb|Fritz|Michell|2001|p=10}}</ref> The decorative details of these structures may have been absorbed into Vijayanagara architecture during the early 15th century, coinciding with the rule of Deva Raya I and Deva Raya II. These kings are known to have employed many Muslims in their army and court, some of whom may have been [[Mughal architecture|Muslim architects]]. This harmonious exchange of architectural ideas must have happened during rare periods of peace between the Hindu and Muslim kingdoms.<ref name=\"harmony\">Philon (2001), p87</ref> The \"Great Platform\" (''Mahanavami Dibba'') has relief carvings in which the figures seem to have the facial features of central Asian Turks who were known to have been employed as royal attendants.<ref name=\"Turk\">Dallapiccola (2001), p69</ref>\n[[File:An aerial view of Madurai city from atop of Meenakshi Amman temple.jpg|thumb|800px|center|An aerial view of the [[Meenakshi Temple]] from the top of the southern [[gopuram]], looking north.

It is attached to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\nThe unit's heritage stems from World War II, with the creation of the [[50th Parachute Brigade (India)|50th Parachute Brigade]] in October 1941. 9 Para SF, raised in 1966 as '''9th Parachute Commando Battalion''', is the oldest among the eight Para SF units of the Indian Army.\n\n==History==\n\nThe parachute units of the Indian Army are among the oldest airborne units in the world. The [[50th Indian Parachute Brigade]] was formed on 27 October 1941, comprising the British [[156th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|151st Parachute Battalion]], the [[British Indian Army]] 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm Parachute Regiment, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100338/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm |date=22 February 2014 }} on GlobalSecurity.org</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/v14n2_vajra_prahar_sb_parachute.html|title=Sidebar: Indian Army Parachute Regiment: A Brief History|last=|first=|date=2018|website=United States Army Special Operations Command|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> The Parachute Regiment was formed from these and several other units in 1952.\n\nIn 1944, the 50th was allocated to the newly founded [[44th Airborne Division (India)|44th Airborne Division]]. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigade\u2014the 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (Punjab), 2 PARA (Maratha) and 3 PARA (Kumaon). During the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] operations of 1947-48 these battalions distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Naushera]], Jhangar and [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]], and were awarded the respective Battle Honours.\n\nOn 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the Parachute Regiment. Since then the Parachute Regiment has grown to comprise ten battalions including Parachute (Special Forces) battalions. In 1986, 8 PARA became 12 Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment, while 21 Maratha LI converted to PARA (Special Forces). During their short but eventful existence so far, the regiment's battalions have had extensive operational experience, and singular achievements, to speak of their level of professionalism.\n\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], an ''ad hoc'' commando unit, named Meghdoot Force, consisting of volunteers from various infantry units was organized by then Major Megh Singh of the [[Brigade of the Guards]]. The unit performed well in combat, and the Government authorized the formal raising of a commando unit. [[Megh Singh|Lt Col Megh Singh]] was selected to raise the unit which was originally intended to be a part of the Brigade of the Guards. However, recognizing parachute qualification as an integral element of special operations, the unit was transferred to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]] and raised as its 9th Battalion (Commando) on 1 July 1966. The erstwhile members of the Meghdoot Force formed the nucleus, and the new unit was based in [[Gwalior]]. In June 1967 the unit was split equally into two to form a second commando unit, designated as 10th Battalion, each with three Companies.  10th Battalion was mandated to operate in the [[Thar Desert|Western Desert]] and 9th Battalion in the northern mountains. In 1969, these battalions were re-designated as 9 and 10 Para (Commando) battalions.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1978, the 1 Para, as an experiment, was converted to become the first special forces unit of the Indian army, and was kept as the tactical reserve. Already a recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice, and the [[General officer commanding|GOC-in-C]] Eastern Command Unit Citation once, the unit was originally 1 Punjab, which was later re-designated as 1 PARA (PUNJAB) and in 1978 was converted to 1 PARA (SF). The unit is well over 200 years old.\n\nOn 15 January 1992, the Parachute Regiment Training Centre along with the Records and PAO(OR), and the Para Regiment, moved to Bangalore and occupied the erstwhile location of Pioneer Corps and Training Centre. Bangalore is the new Key Location Project of the Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|title=Welcome to The Parachute Regiment|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190919/http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n1995 saw the formation of the fourth commando battalion when [[Maratha Light Infantry|21 Maratha Light Infantry]] was selected to convert to special forces and slated for the Eastern Command. After a stringent selection and training process that spanned more than a year, on 1 February 1996, the unit under Colonel VB Shinde, was formally inducted as the 21st Battalion (Special Forces), The Parachute Regiment. The unit has done well in its short lifespan and is the proud recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice (1992 and 2006) and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once (2008), as well as a host of individual gallantry awards. With the changing scenario in military operations and the need for more special forces units, 2 Para began the conversion process from parachute to special forces role, followed closely by the 3 Para and the 4 Para in the year 2004 and 2005. The attempt did see a some success, but the reason it failed to achieve its goal was due to the stringent selection process.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan War===\nThe unit first saw action in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pakistani war]], the first six-man assault team was inserted {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=off}} deep into Indus and Charchao, where they carried out raids. The assault team killed 73 and wounded 140 on the Pakistani side. In addition, they also destroyed 35mm artillery guns of the Pakistan independent battery. They also destroyed an airfield. In Bangladesh 2 PARA (Airborne), which was a part of 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade, carried out India's first airborne assault operation to capture Poongli Bridge in Mymensingh District near Dhaka. Subsequently, they were the first unit to enter Dhaka. For this action 2 PARA were given the Battle Honour of Poongli Bridge and the Theater Honour Dhaka.<ref name=popl>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=K.

During the operation, six artillery guns were destroyed by a raiding team composed of six officers and around 120 soldiers led by Major C. M. Malhotra. The special forces raiders began their operation at 5.30 PM on 13 December 1971. They started off from [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]] and crossed the [[Poonch River]]. After they reached the Mandole village, they started searching for the artillery guns and eventually located them. The raiders divided themselves into six teams. Each one of the six team was tasked to destroy one of the six guns. Subsequently, an intense [[gunfight]] took place between the Indian raiders and [[Pakistan Army]] soldiers. The gunfight resulted in two Indian casualties and many Pakistani casualties, with some Pakistani soldiers escaping from the battle. Finally, the raiders destroyed all the artillery using explosives and returned to their base at 6.30 AM on 14 December 1971.<ref name=mandhol>{{cite web |title=Operation 'Mandhol' forced Pakistan to change war plan |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Operation-Mandhol-forced-Pakistan-to-change-war-plan/articleshow/27444282.cms |website=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=27 February 2020 |date=16 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis operation caused the Pakistan military to tweak its military doctrine by assigning additional soldiers for defending artillery guns. [[Pakistan Army]] officials, who came to India as a delegation after the war had ended, acknowledged the raid. Operation Mandhol is now a part of the syllabus at the [[Indian Military Academy]].<ref name=\"mandhol\" />\n\n==== Chachro Raid ====\nA series of raids were conducted by soldiers from the 10 Para (also known as ''The Desert Scorpions'') at [[Chachro]], Virawah, [[Nagarparkar]] and [[Islamkot]] during the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani war]]. The objective of these raids were to hit [[Pakistan military]] installations located 80 kilometres inside hostile territory, disrupting supply lines, creating confusion and undertake important inroads into hostile territory. Two teams, codenamed Alpha and Charlie, trained for a duration of five months in skills such as [[desert warfare]].<ref name=\"chachro raid\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-chachro-raid-of-1971-indias-most-daring-surgical-strike-in-pakistan-1336153.html|title=The Chachro Raid of 1971 \u2013 India's Most Daring Surgical Strike in Pak|last=|first=|date=January 15, 2017|website=[[CNN-News18]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring the raids, the Indian commandos inserted themselves 80 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory and traversed a distance of over 500 kilometres, attacking [[Pakistan military]] installations and positions. They completed the raids with zero Indian casualties.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe raids began on 5 December 1971, when commandos from the 10 Para penetrated 70 kilometres inside hostile territory. The soldiers went into a defensive posture as they encountered heavy firing from Pakistani posts. The Indian raiders sent one of their vehicles rushing towards Pakistani positions, firing a [[Light machine gun|LMG]], to distract gunfire. This tactic was successful because of the cover provided by nighttime. Subsequently, the other raiders too opened fire and overpowered the Pakistani posts.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nSoon, a [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] team was assigned the task of charting a route for the Alpha team to attack the wing headquarters of the [[Pakistan Rangers]] in [[Chachro]]. The pathfinders used the cover of darkness to chart a suitable route and green-lighted the raid before the dawn of December 7. Within a few hours, the team killed 17 Pakistani soldiers, took 12 prisoners and captured [[Chachro]]. After this raid, the Charlie team exfiltrated out of the battlefield. [[Chachro]] was subsequently handed over to Indian [[Infantry|infantrymen]] and the Alpha team proceeded further.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe Alpha team moved towards their next targets: Virawah and [[Nagarparkar]]. They reached Virawah before the dawn of December 8, moving in broad daylight the preceding day. The first contact made by the raiders with the Pakistani soldiers was at 1:30 AM. [[Hand-to-hand combat]] between the Indian raiders and the Pakistanis ensued, followed by [[Shootout|gunfights]]. Soon, Virawah was captured by the Indian raiders. The raiders then proceeded to [[Nagarparkar]] and captured it by the morning of December 8.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nFollowing this, the Indian raiders had returned to their base in India but were again tasked to attack ammunition dump in [[Islamkot]]. The raiders reached their target at 5:30 AM on December 17 but found the target empty. Subsequently, while retreating, the raiders ambushed a Pakistani convoy, killing 18-20 Pakistani troops and imprisoning survivors.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\n===Operation Bluestar 1984===\nIn 1984 the Para (SF) were involved in [[Operation Blue Star]]. They were charged to lead an attack on the Holy Site of the Sikh religion the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] to evict Sikh militants in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. 80 members of 1 Para (SF) were given the task of assaulting two areas of the temple, one of which required divers. However, there were a number of setbacks as a result of inaccurate intelligence on the strength of the militants who were trained by Gen. [[Shabeg Singh]] (ex- 1 Para himself), operating in low light, the conventional manner of the raid, and the lack of incentive, all of which resulted in a mission failure. The diver mission was aborted after the first team got bogged down. The commandos accompanied by Raghunath dubey achieved their aims after a gunfight with militants that lasted hours.<ref name=\"Katoch\">{{cite web |title=Interview Lt Gen P.C.

However, the lack of proper planning by the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and insufficient intelligence on the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]'s (LTTE) whereabouts, caused [[Jaffna University Helidrop|the initial heli-borne assault]] on Jaffna University on 11 October 1987 to be a tragic failure. However it was because of the efforts of the Para (SF) that later led to the capture of the Jaffna peninsula, forcing the LTTE militants to take refuge in the forests.\n\nSix soldiers lost their lives in that mission. Due to their superior training, the Para (SF) took refuge under a house, after they were misled by a youth who offered his services to help the commandos track [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] but instead took them on a wild goose chase. They engaged the enemy for 24 hours and picked up all their dead with their weapons after reinforcements arrived the next morning.\n\nAfter the failed assault on Jaffna City, the 10 Para (SF) participated in a heli-borne assault on the town of Moolai {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the north west in November 1987. More than 200 LTTE guerrillas were killed and an arms depot seized. In order to give the commandos battle experience, 1 Para (SF) was rotated home in early 1988 and replaced by 9 Para (SF).\n\nThis battalion was scheduled to return home in June 1988, but the tour of duty was extended due to a planned air assault into the coastal swamps around [[Mullaitivu District|Mullaittivu]]. The mission was a success, in that it located several arms caches. The 9 Para (SF) also provided 12 men for the security of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.\n\n===Operation Cactus 1988, Maldives===\n{{Main|Operation Cactus}}\nWith the capture of [[Maldives]], an island nation off the south western coast of India, on 3 November 1988 by the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam]] (PLOTE) [[mercenaries]], the army turned to the 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade to carry out an airborne/air transported operation to liberate the country and return power to the legal government. This operation had 6 PARA spearheading the mission. 6 Para flew in on 4 November 1988 in a fleet of [[IL-76]], [[An-32]] and [[An-12]] transport aircraft.

The first major mobilization of troops in 2009 ended on 21 April. As the troops began pulling out, an Army spokesperson described the operation as a success, disclosing that 129 militants, all belonging to the [[People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak]] (PREPAK) were killed. The Forces also claimed to have located and destroyed five militant camps during the Operation and more than 117 weapons, including sixty nine AK-series rifles, forty-eight rocket launchers, and an unspecified quantity of explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). No militant was arrested. No fatalities among the Special Force (SF) personnel or civilians was reported.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/TWIR/4_3_2009_Manipur|title=Manipur: Operation \u2018Summer Storm\u2019 called off {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/myanmar-operation-sends-a-larger-political-message-india-will-pay-back-if-provoked/articleshow/47657355.cms|title=Myanmar operation sends a larger political message: India will pay back, if provoked|date=2015-06-14|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/operation-summer-storm-392192|title=Operation Summer Storm|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Ongoing counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir and in northeastern India===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://spiderimg.amarujala.com/assets/images/2020/01/31/750x506/nagrota-terror-attack_1580463635.jpeg Para SF operators arrive to take position] before a gunfight took place at a toll plaza in Nagrota, Jammu and Kashmir in January 2020.

They are now actively involved in counter terrorist (CT) and COIN operations in Kashmir as an essential part of the Home Ministry's decision to conduct pro-active raids against militants in the countryside and mountains. Personnel include Para (SF), Paratroopers (Airborne), [[National Security Guards]] (NSG) and special units of the [[Rashtriya Rifles]] - a paramilitary unit created for counter insurgency operations in Kashmir.

The terrorists sneaked across the border early on Thursday, barely three days ahead of a meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. The attack was on a police station. The 16 Cavalry unit of the Army in Samba district falls under the jurisdiction of 9 corps, headquartered at Yol Cantonment in Himachal Pradesh. The three heavily armed terrorists, believed to be from the group [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), were holed up in the cavalry armored unit's camp at Samba for several hours after they barged into the Officers mess, until they were killed during a fierce gunfight with 1 Para (SF) of the army. The bodies of the three terrorists aged between 16 and 19 were in the custody of the Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Court-of-inquiry-ordered-into-terror-attack-on-army-camp-in-Samba/articleshow/23267341.cms|title=Court of inquiry ordered into terror attack on army camp in Samba - Times of India|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929133303/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Court-of-inquiry-ordered-into-terror-attack-on-army-camp-in-Samba/articleshow/23267341.cms|archivedate=29 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAuthorities moved commandos of 1 Para (SF) in helicopters to the shootout site. The Para (SF) commandos first carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the camp before landing to neutralize the three terrorists. The 1 Para (SF) had identified the exact spot during the aerial reconnaissance from where the intruders were returning the army fire. After landing, the commandos started engaging the terrorists in a direct gunfight, but in order to give them an impression that their exact hiding location had still not been identified, an abandoned building inside the camp was blasted. This made the terrorists complacent thinking that their hiding spot had not been yet been pin-pointed. They kept on intermittently returning army fire until all three of them were eliminated. The entire operation, from the moment the terrorists entered the camp until they were gunned down, took nearly nine hours to complete. The main worry of the soldiers tasked to eliminate the terrorists was the Army Public School situated some distance from the place where the terrorists had been engaged in a sustained firefight. Army men were worried about the possibility of the terrorists moving into the school and taking children and staff as hostage. For this reason, the operation to eliminate the terrorists was carried out with extreme caution and patience<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|title=Battle of Samba: How army subdued fidayeens|last=IANS|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816185331/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Counter insurgency operation in Myanmar 2015===\n{{Main|2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar}}\nBased on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 para (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the Indo-Myanmar border and destroyed two militant camps one each of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (K) (NSCN) and the [[Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup]] (KYKL). The operations were carried out inside Myanmar territory along the [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] border at two locations. One of the locations was near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two militants' transit camps.\n\n70 commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. The commandos, equipped with assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles, were divided into two groups after they fast roped from [[HAL Dhruv|Dhruv]] helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} before they reached training camps. Each of the teams was further divided into two sub-groups. While one was responsible for the direct assault, the second formed an outer ring to prevent any of insurgents from running and escaping. The actual operation (hitting the camp and destroying it) took about 40 minutes. Indian Air Force [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters were put on standby, ready to be pressed into service to evacuate the commandos in case anything went wrong.

The regiment has tried raising new battalions to augment the strength of the special forces however the task has not been completed due to the tough selection phase. Furthermore, in the absence of a centralized command and lack of a centralized and standardized procedure for selection, even among the Para (SF) battalions, selection procedures vary. Meaning there is a different standard to get into different Para (SF) battalions.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, there were plans to take the three para commando battalions from the Parachute Regiment and bring them together under an individual specialized organisation, the Special Forces Regiment. However, after several logistic and administrative obstacles, these plans were abandoned, and they continue to be trained and recruited by the Parachute Regiment.\n\nPara (SF) operate in assault teams, which work individually behind enemy lines, whereas the Paratroopers (Airborne) work in large teams and coordinate with other units as their role involves occupying large areas behind enemy lines. The total strength of the regiment stands at about 10,000, this includes five airborne infantry battalions, one Rashtriya Rifles and two Territorial Army battalion personnel, while the Para (SF) includes between 5,000 and 6,000 personnel.

For the Para (Air) it was initially 28 days which became 45 days after 1999 and is now 90 days (approximately 3 months). The Para (SF) was 90 days long and hasn't been changed since. The intensity also differs according to the prospective battalion. Para (SF) selection takes place twice a year. Probationers undergo extreme physical and mental tests. The drop out rate is high. Those who fail go back to their parent regiment. Those who complete the probation are inducted into the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]. 10 Para (SF) selection: the probation for the 10 Para (SF) starts in the desert, with rigorous physical training being undertaken in desert climate. There is no training manual, so there is no specific routine. Probationers go without food for 4 days, they have to minimize water consumption up to 1 litre water for 3 days and be able to go without sleep for 7 days. A 10&nbsp;kg sandbag become a permanent buddy for the probationer. Routine speed marches and runs of 10&nbsp;km, 20&nbsp;km, 30&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km with full battle gears are conducted. Probationers must be exceptional navigators in areas where there is no network signal, no roads or landmarks and sand dunes that keep shifting every night.<ref name=\"mustaffa\" /> In Parachute training, candidates then complete a 3-week Basic Parachute Course at the Indian Army's Parachute Training School in Agra.\n* Advanced SF Training<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.in/Indias-Special-Forces-History-Future/dp/9382573976|title=India's Special Forces: 1: History and Future of Special Forces|last=Katoch|first=Gen P.

Although this is also a training phase, this is still part of the selection process. Here the soldiers undertake various different kinds of training with various organisations overseen by the Parachute Regiment Training Centre and the Special Forces Training School. Training includes weapons handling training land navigation and field craft training, infiltration, assault and ambush tactics; [[close quarter battle]] (CQB) training; urban warfare; counter-terrorism; unarmed combat training and various other courses across training centers of the [[Indian Defense Forces|Indian defense forces]].\n\n==== Training centers and courses ====\n* Commando Training Camp, [[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n* 4-week High-Altitude Commando Course, Parvat Ghatak School in Tawang, [[Arunachal Pradesh]]\n* Desert Warfare School, Rajasthan\n* [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS), Sonamarg, Kashmir\n* Basic Combat Divers course, Indian Navy's Dive School, [[Kochi]]\n* Counter insurgency, at the [[Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (India)|Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram\n* [[Indian Special Forces Training School (SFTS)|Indian Special Forces Training School]], Nahan, Himachal Pradesh; \n* Combat free-fall training (HAHO and HALO) at the Parachute Training School, Agra\n\n==== 90-day probation ====\nSome of the training during the 90 day selection includes:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n* Day 1 to 35: The first 35 days comprises 'Physical and Skills Training'.

It starts with a 10&nbsp;km speed march with 30&nbsp;kg battle loads and an additional 40&nbsp;kg each. This is followed by various exercises included lifting buddies over long periods. This is followed by weight shifting. Weight shifting has three rounds, where various kinds of weights have to be shifted such as 40 litres of jerry cans, tyre trucks and wooden logs up to 85&nbsp;kg in weight.<ref>{{Citation|last=DiscoveryChannelInd|title=A Test Of Will Power {{!}} India's Paratroopers: Earning The Badge|date=2016-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijDgSuxw4ZA|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> During the 11th hour, trial by water is conducted<ref>{{Citation|last=DiscoveryChannelInd|title=A Test Of Physical And Mental Strength - India's Paratroopers: Earning The Badge|date=2016-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnJNuutHuuM&t=46s|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> - simulated drowning, allowing only the bare minimum oxygen over a long period of time. This is to test probationers panic reactions under stress. The hands are also tied later on and using ropes the probationers are pulled under water. It is well known that hypoxia and blackout due to lack of oxygen is common during this test. The first 16 hours are completed without a drop of water or food. This is followed by immediate observational skills and operation tactics under pressure which included probationary having to recall objects placed in their exercises. This is followed by 10&nbsp;km speed march and 6 hours of continuous exercises. Finally practical combat skills tested such as placing ambushes, response to an ambush, making camps, stretchers and simulated evacs. This is all done at the last stage of the stress test under lack to sleep and extreme fatigue mainly to test mental endurance of the probationers under such conditions and how they react. The 36 hours stress test also sees many probationers leave.\n* Day 56: The Para SF 100&nbsp;km endurance run is a must for all probationers. With 10&nbsp;kg battle load and personal weapon of 7&nbsp;kg they have to run 100&nbsp;km. The time taken averages 13 to 15 hours. A known route the Para SF have used for this run is the hilly route between Rampur and Dakkal.

In the special forces, the members are imparted both basic and advance training. They are taught specialised modes of infiltration and exfiltration, either by air (combat freefall) or sea (combat diving). Some trainees return to PTS to undergo the free-fall course, which requires at least 50 jumps from altitudes up to {{convert|33,500|ft|m|abbr=off}} to pass. Both High Altitude Low Opening ([[HALO/HAHO|HALO]]) and High Altitude High Opening ([[HAHO]])techniques are learned. The ability to use the HAHO method and specially designed maneuverable [[parachute]]s called HAPPS (High Altitude Parachute Penetration System)/AMX-310 to conduct stealth insertions over distances up to {{convert|50|km|mi}} is also perfected.<ref name=\"BR para\" />\n\nFor combat diving training, the commandos are sent to the Naval Diving School, Kochi. Like other special forces, these para commandos are trained for land, air and water.\n\nThe daily routine begins with a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} morning run. Infiltration, exfiltration, assault, room and building intervention, intelligence gathering, patrolling, ambush tactics, counter-ambush tactics, counter insurgency, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, guerilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, raids and sabotage, martial arts training, tactical shooting, stress firing, reflex shooting, buddy system drills, close quarter battle, tactical driving, advance weapon courses and handling, sniping, demolition training, survival skills, linguistic training, logistic training, trade-craft training is imparted by the intelligence agencies. The training drills involve live ammunition at all times which is a reason for fatal accidents at times leading to death.\n\nNight and weapons training and field craft involving {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} treks with {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} loads and live ammunition are conducted. Weekly forced marches with {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}} combat loads with distances over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} and quarterly night drops with full combat loads are also conducted.\n\nIn addition to this in-house training, the commandos also attend a number of schools run by the Army that specialise in terrain and environmental warfare.<ref name=\"BR para\" /> These include the Junior Leaders' Commando Training Camp in [[Belgaum]], [[Karnataka]], the Parvat Ghatak School (for high altitude mountain warfare) in Tawang [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the desert warfare school in [[Rajasthan]], the [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS) in Sonamarg, [[Kashmir]], the [[Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram, and the [[Indian special forces training school]] in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh.

SOF members from the three nations routinely train at each other's facilities to improve military cooperation and tactical skills. This allows the SOF operators from each nation to see tactics and perspectives offered by other top-notch organizations. [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] also conducted joint HAHO training with the Para (SF) in 1992, underwater training in 1995, and anti-terrorism training in 1997. It is thought that the [[French Foreign Legion]] also has approached CIJWS regarding the courses taught by them.

It is attached to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\nThe unit's heritage stems from World War II, with the creation of the [[50th Parachute Brigade (India)|50th Parachute Brigade]] in October 1941. 9 Para SF, raised in 1966 as '''9th Parachute Commando Battalion''', is the oldest among the eight Para SF units of the Indian Army.\n\n==History==\n\nThe parachute units of the Indian Army are among the oldest airborne units in the world. The [[50th Indian Parachute Brigade]] was formed on 27 October 1941, comprising the British [[156th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|151st Parachute Battalion]], the [[British Indian Army]] 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm Parachute Regiment, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100338/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm |date=22 February 2014 }} on GlobalSecurity.org</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/v14n2_vajra_prahar_sb_parachute.html|title=Sidebar: Indian Army Parachute Regiment: A Brief History|last=|first=|date=2018|website=United States Army Special Operations Command|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> The Parachute Regiment was formed from these and several other units in 1952.\n\nIn 1944, the 50th was allocated to the newly founded [[44th Airborne Division (India)|44th Airborne Division]]. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigade\u2014the 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (Punjab), 2 PARA (Maratha) and 3 PARA (Kumaon). During the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] operations of 1947-48 these battalions distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Naushera]], Jhangar and [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]], and were awarded the respective Battle Honours.\n\nOn 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the Parachute Regiment. Since then the Parachute Regiment has grown to comprise ten battalions including Parachute (Special Forces) battalions. In 1986, 8 PARA became 12 Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment, while 21 Maratha LI converted to PARA (Special Forces). During their short but eventful existence so far, the regiment's battalions have had extensive operational experience, and singular achievements, to speak of their level of professionalism.\n\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], an ''ad hoc'' commando unit, named Meghdoot Force, consisting of volunteers from various infantry units was organized by then Major Megh Singh of the [[Brigade of the Guards]]. The unit performed well in combat, and the Government authorized the formal raising of a commando unit. [[Megh Singh|Lt Col Megh Singh]] was selected to raise the unit which was originally intended to be a part of the Brigade of the Guards. However, recognizing parachute qualification as an integral element of special operations, the unit was transferred to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]] and raised as its 9th Battalion (Commando) on 1 July 1966. The erstwhile members of the Meghdoot Force formed the nucleus, and the new unit was based in [[Gwalior]]. In June 1967 the unit was split equally into two to form a second commando unit, designated as 10th Battalion, each with three Companies.  10th Battalion was mandated to operate in the [[Thar Desert|Western Desert]] and 9th Battalion in the northern mountains. In 1969, these battalions were re-designated as 9 and 10 Para (Commando) battalions.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1978, the 1 Para, as an experiment, was converted to become the first special forces unit of the Indian army, and was kept as the tactical reserve. Already a recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice, and the [[General officer commanding|GOC-in-C]] Eastern Command Unit Citation once, the unit was originally 1 Punjab, which was later re-designated as 1 PARA (PUNJAB) and in 1978 was converted to 1 PARA (SF). The unit is well over 200 years old.\n\nOn 15 January 1992, the Parachute Regiment Training Centre along with the Records and PAO(OR), and the Para Regiment, moved to Bangalore and occupied the erstwhile location of Pioneer Corps and Training Centre. Bangalore is the new Key Location Project of the Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|title=Welcome to The Parachute Regiment|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190919/http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n1995 saw the formation of the fourth commando battalion when [[Maratha Light Infantry|21 Maratha Light Infantry]] was selected to convert to special forces and slated for the Eastern Command. After a stringent selection and training process that spanned more than a year, on 1 February 1996, the unit under Colonel VB Shinde, was formally inducted as the 21st Battalion (Special Forces), The Parachute Regiment. The unit has done well in its short lifespan and is the proud recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice (1992 and 2006) and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once (2008), as well as a host of individual gallantry awards. With the changing scenario in military operations and the need for more special forces units, 2 Para began the conversion process from parachute to special forces role, followed closely by the 3 Para and the 4 Para in the year 2004 and 2005. The attempt did see a some success, but the reason it failed to achieve its goal was due to the stringent selection process.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan War===\nThe unit first saw action in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pakistani war]], the first six-man assault team was inserted {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=off}} deep into Indus and Charchao, where they carried out raids. The assault team killed 73 and wounded 140 on the Pakistani side. In addition, they also destroyed 35mm artillery guns of the Pakistan independent battery. They also destroyed an airfield. In Bangladesh 2 PARA (Airborne), which was a part of 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade, carried out India's first airborne assault operation to capture Poongli Bridge in Mymensingh District near Dhaka. Subsequently, they were the first unit to enter Dhaka. For this action 2 PARA were given the Battle Honour of Poongli Bridge and the Theater Honour Dhaka.<ref name=popl>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=K.

During the operation, six artillery guns were destroyed by a raiding team composed of six officers and around 120 soldiers led by Major C. M. Malhotra. The special forces raiders began their operation at 5.30 PM on 13 December 1971. They started off from [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]] and crossed the [[Poonch River]]. After they reached the Mandole village, they started searching for the artillery guns and eventually located them. The raiders divided themselves into six teams. Each one of the six team was tasked to destroy one of the six guns. Subsequently, an intense [[gunfight]] took place between the Indian raiders and [[Pakistan Army]] soldiers. The gunfight resulted in two Indian casualties and many Pakistani casualties, with some Pakistani soldiers escaping from the battle. Finally, the raiders destroyed all the artillery using explosives and returned to their base at 6.30 AM on 14 December 1971.<ref name=mandhol>{{cite web |title=Operation 'Mandhol' forced Pakistan to change war plan |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Operation-Mandhol-forced-Pakistan-to-change-war-plan/articleshow/27444282.cms |website=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=27 February 2020 |date=16 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis operation caused the Pakistan military to tweak its military doctrine by assigning additional soldiers for defending artillery guns. [[Pakistan Army]] officials, who came to India as a delegation after the war had ended, acknowledged the raid. Operation Mandhol is now a part of the syllabus at the [[Indian Military Academy]].<ref name=\"mandhol\" />\n\n==== Chachro Raid ====\nA series of raids were conducted by soldiers from the 10 Para (also known as ''The Desert Scorpions'') at [[Chachro]], Virawah, [[Nagarparkar]] and [[Islamkot]] during the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani war]]. The objective of these raids were to hit [[Pakistan military]] installations located 80 kilometres inside hostile territory, disrupting supply lines, creating confusion and undertake important inroads into hostile territory. Two teams, codenamed Alpha and Charlie, trained for a duration of five months in skills such as [[desert warfare]].<ref name=\"chachro raid\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-chachro-raid-of-1971-indias-most-daring-surgical-strike-in-pakistan-1336153.html|title=The Chachro Raid of 1971 \u2013 India's Most Daring Surgical Strike in Pak|last=|first=|date=January 15, 2017|website=[[CNN-News18]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring the raids, the Indian commandos inserted themselves 80 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory and traversed a distance of over 500 kilometres, attacking [[Pakistan military]] installations and positions. They completed the raids with zero Indian casualties.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe raids began on 5 December 1971, when commandos from the 10 Para penetrated 70 kilometres inside hostile territory. The soldiers went into a defensive posture as they encountered heavy firing from Pakistani posts. The Indian raiders sent one of their vehicles rushing towards Pakistani positions, firing a [[Light machine gun|LMG]], to distract gunfire. This tactic was successful because of the cover provided by nighttime. Subsequently, the other raiders too opened fire and overpowered the Pakistani posts.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nSoon, a [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] team was assigned the task of charting a route for the Alpha team to attack the wing headquarters of the [[Pakistan Rangers]] in [[Chachro]]. The pathfinders used the cover of darkness to chart a suitable route and green-lighted the raid before the dawn of December 7. Within a few hours, the team killed 17 Pakistani soldiers, took 12 prisoners and captured [[Chachro]]. After this raid, the Charlie team exfiltrated out of the battlefield. [[Chachro]] was subsequently handed over to Indian [[Infantry|infantrymen]] and the Alpha team proceeded further.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe Alpha team moved towards their next targets: Virawah and [[Nagarparkar]]. They reached Virawah before the dawn of December 8, moving in broad daylight the preceding day. The first contact made by the raiders with the Pakistani soldiers was at 1:30 AM. [[Hand-to-hand combat]] between the Indian raiders and the Pakistanis ensued, followed by [[Shootout|gunfights]]. Soon, Virawah was captured by the Indian raiders. The raiders then proceeded to [[Nagarparkar]] and captured it by the morning of December 8.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nFollowing this, the Indian raiders had returned to their base in India but were again tasked to attack ammunition dump in [[Islamkot]]. The raiders reached their target at 5:30 AM on December 17 but found the target empty. Subsequently, while retreating, the raiders ambushed a Pakistani convoy, killing 18-20 Pakistani troops and imprisoning survivors.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\n===Operation Bluestar 1984===\nIn 1984 the Para (SF) were involved in [[Operation Blue Star]]. They were charged to lead an attack on the Holy Site of the Sikh religion the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] to evict Sikh militants in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. 80 members of 1 Para (SF) were given the task of assaulting two areas of the temple, one of which required divers. However, there were a number of setbacks as a result of inaccurate intelligence on the strength of the militants who were trained by Gen. [[Shabeg Singh]] (ex- 1 Para himself), operating in low light, the conventional manner of the raid, and the lack of incentive, all of which resulted in a mission failure. The diver mission was aborted after the first team got bogged down. The commandos accompanied by Raghunath dubey achieved their aims after a gunfight with militants that lasted hours.<ref name=\"Katoch\">{{cite web |title=Interview Lt Gen P.C.

However, the lack of proper planning by the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and insufficient intelligence on the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]'s (LTTE) whereabouts, caused [[Jaffna University Helidrop|the initial heli-borne assault]] on Jaffna University on 11 October 1987 to be a tragic failure. However it was because of the efforts of the Para (SF) that later led to the capture of the Jaffna peninsula, forcing the LTTE militants to take refuge in the forests.\n\nSix soldiers lost their lives in that mission. Due to their superior training, the Para (SF) took refuge under a house, after they were misled by a youth who offered his services to help the commandos track [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] but instead took them on a wild goose chase. They engaged the enemy for 24 hours and picked up all their dead with their weapons after reinforcements arrived the next morning.\n\nAfter the failed assault on Jaffna City, the 10 Para (SF) participated in a heli-borne assault on the town of Moolai {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the north west in November 1987. More than 200 LTTE guerrillas were killed and an arms depot seized. In order to give the commandos battle experience, 1 Para (SF) was rotated home in early 1988 and replaced by 9 Para (SF).\n\nThis battalion was scheduled to return home in June 1988, but the tour of duty was extended due to a planned air assault into the coastal swamps around [[Mullaitivu District|Mullaittivu]]. The mission was a success, in that it located several arms caches. The 9 Para (SF) also provided 12 men for the security of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.\n\n===Operation Cactus 1988, Maldives===\n{{Main|Operation Cactus}}\nWith the capture of [[Maldives]], an island nation off the south western coast of India, on 3 November 1988 by the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam]] (PLOTE) [[mercenaries]], the army turned to the 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade to carry out an airborne/air transported operation to liberate the country and return power to the legal government. This operation had 6 PARA spearheading the mission. 6 Para flew in on 4 November 1988 in a fleet of [[IL-76]], [[An-32]] and [[An-12]] transport aircraft.

The first major mobilization of troops in 2009 ended on 21 April. As the troops began pulling out, an Army spokesperson described the operation as a success, disclosing that 129 militants, all belonging to the [[People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak]] (PREPAK) were killed. The Forces also claimed to have located and destroyed five militant camps during the Operation and more than 117 weapons, including sixty nine AK-series rifles, forty-eight rocket launchers, and an unspecified quantity of explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). No militant was arrested. No fatalities among the Special Force (SF) personnel or civilians was reported.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/TWIR/4_3_2009_Manipur|title=Manipur: Operation \u2018Summer Storm\u2019 called off {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/myanmar-operation-sends-a-larger-political-message-india-will-pay-back-if-provoked/articleshow/47657355.cms|title=Myanmar operation sends a larger political message: India will pay back, if provoked|date=2015-06-14|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/operation-summer-storm-392192|title=Operation Summer Storm|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Ongoing counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir and in northeastern India===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://spiderimg.amarujala.com/assets/images/2020/01/31/750x506/nagrota-terror-attack_1580463635.jpeg Para SF operators arrive to take position] before a gunfight took place at a toll plaza in Nagrota, Jammu and Kashmir in January 2020.

They are now actively involved in counter terrorist (CT) and COIN operations in Kashmir as an essential part of the Home Ministry's decision to conduct pro-active raids against militants in the countryside and mountains. Personnel include Para (SF), Paratroopers (Airborne), [[National Security Guards]] (NSG) and special units of the [[Rashtriya Rifles]] - a paramilitary unit created for counter insurgency operations in Kashmir.

The terrorists sneaked across the border early on Thursday, barely three days ahead of a meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. The attack was on a police station. The 16 Cavalry unit of the Army in Samba district falls under the jurisdiction of 9 corps, headquartered at Yol Cantonment in Himachal Pradesh. The three heavily armed terrorists, believed to be from the group [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), were holed up in the cavalry armored unit's camp at Samba for several hours after they barged into the Officers mess, until they were killed during a fierce gunfight with 1 Para (SF) of the army. The bodies of the three terrorists aged between 16 and 19 were in the custody of the Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Court-of-inquiry-ordered-into-terror-attack-on-army-camp-in-Samba/articleshow/23267341.cms|title=Court of inquiry ordered into terror attack on army camp in Samba - Times of India|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929133303/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Court-of-inquiry-ordered-into-terror-attack-on-army-camp-in-Samba/articleshow/23267341.cms|archivedate=29 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAuthorities moved commandos of 1 Para (SF) in helicopters to the shootout site. The Para (SF) commandos first carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the camp before landing to neutralize the three terrorists. The 1 Para (SF) had identified the exact spot during the aerial reconnaissance from where the intruders were returning the army fire. After landing, the commandos started engaging the terrorists in a direct gunfight, but in order to give them an impression that their exact hiding location had still not been identified, an abandoned building inside the camp was blasted. This made the terrorists complacent thinking that their hiding spot had not been yet been pin-pointed. They kept on intermittently returning army fire until all three of them were eliminated. The entire operation, from the moment the terrorists entered the camp until they were gunned down, took nearly nine hours to complete. The main worry of the soldiers tasked to eliminate the terrorists was the Army Public School situated some distance from the place where the terrorists had been engaged in a sustained firefight. Army men were worried about the possibility of the terrorists moving into the school and taking children and staff as hostage. For this reason, the operation to eliminate the terrorists was carried out with extreme caution and patience<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|title=Battle of Samba: How army subdued fidayeens|last=IANS|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816185331/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Counter insurgency operation in Myanmar 2015===\n{{Main|2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar}}\nBased on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 para (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the Indo-Myanmar border and destroyed two militant camps one each of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (K) (NSCN) and the [[Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup]] (KYKL). The operations were carried out inside Myanmar territory along the [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] border at two locations. One of the locations was near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two militants' transit camps.\n\n70 commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. The commandos, equipped with assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles, were divided into two groups after they fast roped from [[HAL Dhruv|Dhruv]] helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} before they reached training camps. Each of the teams was further divided into two sub-groups. While one was responsible for the direct assault, the second formed an outer ring to prevent any of insurgents from running and escaping. The actual operation (hitting the camp and destroying it) took about 40 minutes. Indian Air Force [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters were put on standby, ready to be pressed into service to evacuate the commandos in case anything went wrong.

The regiment has tried raising new battalions to augment the strength of the special forces however the task has not been completed due to the tough selection phase. Furthermore, in the absence of a centralized command and lack of a centralized and standardized procedure for selection, even among the Para (SF) battalions, selection procedures vary. Meaning there is a different standard to get into different Para (SF) battalions.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, there were plans to take the three para commando battalions from the Parachute Regiment and bring them together under an individual specialized organisation, the Special Forces Regiment. However, after several logistic and administrative obstacles, these plans were abandoned, and they continue to be trained and recruited by the Parachute Regiment.\n\nPara (SF) operate in assault teams, which work individually behind enemy lines, whereas the Paratroopers (Airborne) work in large teams and coordinate with other units as their role involves occupying large areas behind enemy lines. The total strength of the regiment stands at about 10,000, this includes five airborne infantry battalions, one Rashtriya Rifles and two Territorial Army battalion personnel, while the Para (SF) includes between 5,000 and 6,000 personnel.

For the Para (Air) it was initially 28 days which became 45 days after 1999 and is now 90 days (approximately 3 months). The Para (SF) was 90 days long and hasn't been changed since. The intensity also differs according to the prospective battalion. Para (SF) selection takes place twice a year. Probationers undergo extreme physical and mental tests. The drop out rate is high. Those who fail go back to their parent regiment. Those who complete the probation are inducted into the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]. 10 Para (SF) selection: the probation for the 10 Para (SF) starts in the desert, with rigorous physical training being undertaken in desert climate. There is no training manual, so there is no specific routine. Probationers go without food for 4 days, they have to minimize water consumption up to 1 litre water for 3 days and be able to go without sleep for 7 days. A 10&nbsp;kg sandbag become a permanent buddy for the probationer. Routine speed marches and runs of 10&nbsp;km, 20&nbsp;km, 30&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km with full battle gears are conducted. Probationers must be exceptional navigators in areas where there is no network signal, no roads or landmarks and sand dunes that keep shifting every night.<ref name=\"mustaffa\" /> In Parachute training, candidates then complete a 3-week Basic Parachute Course at the Indian Army's Parachute Training School in Agra.\n* Advanced SF Training<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.in/Indias-Special-Forces-History-Future/dp/9382573976|title=India's Special Forces: 1: History and Future of Special Forces|last=Katoch|first=Gen P.

Although this is also a training phase, this is still part of the selection process. Here the soldiers undertake various different kinds of training with various organisations overseen by the Parachute Regiment Training Centre and the Special Forces Training School. Training includes weapons handling training land navigation and field craft training, infiltration, assault and ambush tactics; [[close quarter battle]] (CQB) training; urban warfare; counter-terrorism; unarmed combat training and various other courses across training centers of the [[Indian Defense Forces|Indian defense forces]].\n\n==== Training centers and courses ====\n* Commando Training Camp, [[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n* 4-week High-Altitude Commando Course, Parvat Ghatak School in Tawang, [[Arunachal Pradesh]]\n* Desert Warfare School, Rajasthan\n* [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS), Sonamarg, Kashmir\n* Basic Combat Divers course, Indian Navy's Dive School, [[Kochi]]\n* Counter insurgency, at the [[Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (India)|Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram\n* [[Indian Special Forces Training School (SFTS)|Indian Special Forces Training School]], Nahan, Himachal Pradesh; \n* Combat free-fall training (HAHO and HALO) at the Parachute Training School, Agra\n\n==== 90-day probation ====\nSome of the training during the 90 day selection includes:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n* Day 1 to 35: The first 35 days comprises 'Physical and Skills Training'.

It starts with a 10&nbsp;km speed march with 30&nbsp;kg battle loads and an additional 40&nbsp;kg each. This is followed by various exercises included lifting buddies over long periods. This is followed by weight shifting. Weight shifting has three rounds, where various kinds of weights have to be shifted such as 40 litres of jerry cans, tyre trucks and wooden logs up to 85&nbsp;kg in weight.<ref>{{Citation|last=DiscoveryChannelInd|title=A Test Of Will Power {{!}} India's Paratroopers: Earning The Badge|date=2016-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijDgSuxw4ZA|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> During the 11th hour, trial by water is conducted<ref>{{Citation|last=DiscoveryChannelInd|title=A Test Of Physical And Mental Strength - India's Paratroopers: Earning The Badge|date=2016-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnJNuutHuuM&t=46s|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> - simulated drowning, allowing only the bare minimum oxygen over a long period of time. This is to test probationers panic reactions under stress. The hands are also tied later on and using ropes the probationers are pulled under water. It is well known that hypoxia and blackout due to lack of oxygen is common during this test. The first 16 hours are completed without a drop of water or food. This is followed by immediate observational skills and operation tactics under pressure which included probationary having to recall objects placed in their exercises. This is followed by 10&nbsp;km speed march and 6 hours of continuous exercises. Finally practical combat skills tested such as placing ambushes, response to an ambush, making camps, stretchers and simulated evacs. This is all done at the last stage of the stress test under lack to sleep and extreme fatigue mainly to test mental endurance of the probationers under such conditions and how they react. The 36 hours stress test also sees many probationers leave.\n* Day 56: The Para SF 100&nbsp;km endurance run is a must for all probationers. With 10&nbsp;kg battle load and personal weapon of 7&nbsp;kg they have to run 100&nbsp;km. The time taken averages 13 to 15 hours. A known route the Para SF have used for this run is the hilly route between Rampur and Dakkal.

In the special forces, the members are imparted both basic and advance training. They are taught specialised modes of infiltration and exfiltration, either by air (combat freefall) or sea (combat diving). Some trainees return to PTS to undergo the free-fall course, which requires at least 50 jumps from altitudes up to {{convert|33,500|ft|m|abbr=off}} to pass. Both High Altitude Low Opening ([[HALO/HAHO|HALO]]) and High Altitude High Opening ([[HAHO]])techniques are learned. The ability to use the HAHO method and specially designed maneuverable [[parachute]]s called HAPPS (High Altitude Parachute Penetration System)/AMX-310 to conduct stealth insertions over distances up to {{convert|50|km|mi}} is also perfected.<ref name=\"BR para\" />\n\nFor combat diving training, the commandos are sent to the Naval Diving School, Kochi. Like other special forces, these para commandos are trained for land, air and water.\n\nThe daily routine begins with a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} morning run. Infiltration, exfiltration, assault, room and building intervention, intelligence gathering, patrolling, ambush tactics, counter-ambush tactics, counter insurgency, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, guerilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, raids and sabotage, martial arts training, tactical shooting, stress firing, reflex shooting, buddy system drills, close quarter battle, tactical driving, advance weapon courses and handling, sniping, demolition training, survival skills, linguistic training, logistic training, trade-craft training is imparted by the intelligence agencies. The training drills involve live ammunition at all times which is a reason for fatal accidents at times leading to death.\n\nNight and weapons training and field craft involving {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} treks with {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} loads and live ammunition are conducted. Weekly forced marches with {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}} combat loads with distances over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} and quarterly night drops with full combat loads are also conducted.\n\nIn addition to this in-house training, the commandos also attend a number of schools run by the Army that specialise in terrain and environmental warfare.<ref name=\"BR para\" /> These include the Junior Leaders' Commando Training Camp in [[Belgaum]], [[Karnataka]], the Parvat Ghatak School (for high altitude mountain warfare) in Tawang [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the desert warfare school in [[Rajasthan]], the [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS) in Sonamarg, [[Kashmir]], the [[Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram, and the [[Indian special forces training school]] in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh. These schools are among the finest of their kind anywhere, and routinely host students from other countries.<ref name=\"BR para\" />\n\nMembers of [[USSOCOM]] (United States Special Operations Command) and [[UKSF]] (United Kingdom Special Forces) have conducted joint training exercises with the Indian Paras. SOF members from the three nations routinely train at each other's facilities to improve military cooperation and tactical skills. This allows the SOF operators from each nation to see tactics and perspectives offered by other top-notch organizations. [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] also conducted joint HAHO training with the Para (SF) in 1992, underwater training in 1995, and anti-terrorism training in 1997. It is thought that the [[French Foreign Legion]] also has approached CIJWS regarding the courses taught by them.
