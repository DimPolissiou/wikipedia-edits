It was then that existing engineer and cavalry units in the Florida Panhandle were converted and redesignated as the reconstituted 3rd Infantry Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment with headquarters at Panama City.

Three years after the cavalry transformation, the Squadron was mobilized and deployed with the [[53rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|53rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team]] in support of Operations [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraqi Freedom]] and New Dawn. In preparation for their 2010 deployment, the Squadron underwent intense pre-mobilization training at [[Camp Blanding]], Florida for the entire month of October 2009. They mobilized under [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10]] orders on 2 January 2010 and flew to [[Fort Hood]], Texas for two months of mobilization training. In the first week of March the squadron arrived at [[Camp Buehring]], [[Kuwait]]. Troop B deployed to Qatar for a security force mission.
