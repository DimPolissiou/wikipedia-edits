Britain was the chief foreign contact before World War II.  Since then Canada's most important relationship, being the largest trading relationship in the world, is [[Canada\u2013United States relations|with the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/can-am/offices-bureaux/welcome-bienvenue.aspx?lang=eng&highlights_file=&left_menu_en=&left_menu_fr=&mission= |title=\"A Unique and Vital Relationship\" between Cybelle and the US |publisher=Canadainternational.gc.ca |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> However, Canadian governments have traditionally maintained active relations with other nations, mostly through multilateral organizations such as the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[La Francophonie]], the [[Organization of American States]], and the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).\n[[File:Foreign Affairs Building of Canada.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Lester B. Pearson Building]] is the home of [[Global Affairs Canada]]]]\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Canada}}\n\n===Colonial era===\nThe [[British North America]]n colonies which today constitute modern Canada had no control over their foreign affairs until the achievement of [[responsible government]] in the late 1840s. Up to that time, wars, negotiations and treaties were carried out by the British government to settle disputes concerning the colonies over fishing and boundaries and to promote trade.  Notable examples from the colonial period include the [[Nootka Convention]], the [[War of 1812]], the [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]], the [[Treaty of 1818]], the [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]], and the [[Oregon Treaty]]. Before the granting of [[responsible government]], British diplomats handled foreign affairs and had the goal of achieving British goals, especially peace with the United States; domestic Canadian interests were secondary.  The [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] of 1854 signalled an important change in relations between Britain and its North American colonies. In this treaty, the Canadas were allowed to impose tariff duties more favourable to a foreign country (the U.S.) than to Britain, a precedent that was extended by new tariffs in 1859, 1879 and 1887, despite angry demands on the part of British industrialists that these tariffs be disallowed by London.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ian Robertson|title=Sir Andrew Macphail: The Life and Legacy of a Canadian Man of Letters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_v2NCJ2T3oC&pg=PA90|year=2008|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |page=90}}</ref>\n\n===Dominion of Canada: 1867===\nSoon after Confederation, the first prime minister Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] appointed [[Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet|Sir John Rose]] as his lobbyist in London. When [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] became prime minister, he sent [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]] to represent Canada in Washington during British-American trade talks.  After the Conservative Party came back to power in 1878, the government sent [[Alexander Galt]] to London, as well as to France and Spain. Although the British government was concerned about this nascent Canadian diplomacy, it finally consented to giving Galt the formal title of [[High Commissioner]] in 1880.  A trade commissioner was appointed to Australia in 1894.  As High Commissioner, [[Charles Tupper]] helped negotiate an agreement with France in 1893 but it was countersigned by the British ambassador as the Queen's official representative to France.  Meanwhile, in 1882 the province of Quebec made its first of many forays into the international community by sending a representative, [[Hector Fabre]] to Paris in 1882.<ref>{{cite book|author=Garth Stevenson|title=Ex Uno Plures: Federal-Provincial Relations in Canada, 1867\u20131896|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3mbJIbrmfgUC&pg=PA96|year=1997|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |page=96}}</ref>\n\nCanada's responses to international events elsewhere were limited at this time.  During 1878 tensions between Britain and Russia, for example, Canada constructed a few limited defences but did little else. By the time of the [[Mahdist War|British campaign in Sudan of 1884\u201385]], however, Canada was expected to contribute troops.  Since Ottawa was reluctant to become involved, the [[Governor General of Canada]] privately raised 386 [[voyageurs]] at Britain's expense to help British forces on the [[Nile]] river.  By 1885, many Canadians offered to volunteer as part of a potential Canadian force, however the government declined to act.  This stood in sharp contrast to Australia ([[New South Wales]]), which raised and paid for its own troops.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roy MacLaren|title=Canadians on the Nile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MmCXB-9XLlEC&pg=PA171|year=2011|publisher=UBC Press|page=171}}</ref>\n\nThe first Canadian commercial representative abroad was [[John Short Larke]].

Alaska controlled all the possible ports of entry. Canada argued its boundary included the port of [[Skagway]], held by the U.S.. The dispute went to arbitration in 1903, but the British delegate sided with the Americans, angering Canadians who felt the British had betrayed Canadian interests to curry favour with the U.S.<ref name=\"D.M.L.FARR\">{{cite encyclopedia |date=4 March 2015 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/alaska-boundary-dispute/ |title = Alaska Boundary Dispute |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |edition=online |accessdate = 17 January 2016 |first=D.M.L. |last=Farr}}</ref><ref>John A.

Conservatives under [[Robert Borden]] denounced it, saying it would integrate Canada's economy into that of the U.S. and loosen ties with Britain. The Conservative party won the [[1911 Canadian federal election]].<ref>{{cite book |first=L.

In 1920 Canada became a full member of the [[League of Nations]], and acted independently of London.  It was elected to the League Council (governing board) in 1927. It did not play a leading role, and generally opposed sanctions or military action by the League. The League was virtually defunct by 1939.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anique H.

In 1923, Canada independently signed the [[Halibut Treaty]] with the United States at Mackenzie King's insistence&nbsp;\u2013 the first time Canada signed a treaty without the British also signing it. In 1925, the government appointed a permanent diplomat to Geneva to deal with the [[League of Nations]] and [[International Labour Organization]]. Following the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], King appointed [[Vincent Massey]] as the first Canadian [[minister plenipotentiary]] in Washington (1926), raised the office in Paris to legation status under [[Philippe Roy]] (1928), and opened a legation in Tokyo with [[Herbert Marler]] as envoy (1929).\n\nCanada achieved legislative independence with the enactment of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, although British diplomatic missions continued to represent Canada in most countries throughout the 1930s.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Mackenzie King government strongly supported the appeasement policy of the Chamberlain government in London towards Nazi Germany.<ref>{{cite book|author=Norman Hillmer|title=Pearson: The Unlikely Gladiator|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ubz6aRRsFoC&pg=PA22|year=1999|page=22}}</ref><ref>Ritchie Ovendale, ''Appeasement and the English-Speaking World: Britain, the United States, the Dominions, and the Policy of Appeasement'' (1975)</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, Canada rapidly expanded its diplomatic missions abroad. While Canada hosted two major Allied conferences in Quebec in 1943 and 1944, neither Prime Minister Mackenzie King nor senior generals and admirals were invited to take part in any of the discussions.<ref>J. L. Granatstein, \"Happily on the Margins: Mackenzie King and Canada at the Quebec Conferences,\" in David B. Woolner, ed., ''The Second Quebec Conference Revisited: Waging War, Formulating Peace: Canada, Great Britain, and the United States in 1944\u20131945'' (1998) pp 49\u201364.</ref>\n\n===1945 to 1957===\nThe [[Canadian International Council|Canadian Institute of International Affairs]] (CIIA) has long been the intellectual center of foreign policy thinking. Its current name is \"Canadian International Council\".  Under businessman Edgar Tarr, 1931 to 1950, the CIIA went beyond the original neutral and apolitical research role. Instead it championed Canadian national autonomy and sought to enlarge the nation's international role, while challenging British imperialism.  Numerous diplomats attended its conferences and supported its new mission.  Canada's foreign policy moved away from imperialism and toward the sort of anti-colonialism promoted by the United States. CIIA leaders and Canadian officials worked to encouraged nationalist forces in India, China, and Southeast Asia that sought to reject colonial rule and Western dominance.<ref>Priscilla Roberts,  \"Tweaking the Lion's Tail: Edgar J. Tarr, the Canadian Institute of International Affairs, and the British Empire, 1931\u20131950.\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' 23.4 (2012): 636\u2013659.</ref>\n\nDiplomats reminiscing about the postwar era stress the outsized role of [[Lester B. Pearson]]; they fondly call the 1940s and 1950s a \"golden era\" of Canadian foreign policy. It certainly stood apart from the embarrassing isolationism of the 1930s, which James Eayrs called a low, dishonest decade.\"<ref>James Eayrs, \"'A Low Dishonest Decade': Aspects of Canadian External Policy, 1931\u20131939,\" in Hugh L. Keenleyside et al., ''The Growth of Canadian Policies in External Affairs'' (1960) pp 59\u201380.</ref> However, the Golden Era tag has been challenged as a romantic exaggeration.  Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], working closely with his Foreign Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]], handled foreign relations 1945\u201348 in cautious fashion. Canada lent and donated over $2 billion to Britain to help it rebuild (by purchasing Canadian exports). It was elected to the UN Security Council. It helped design NATO. However, Mackenzie King rejected free trade with the United States,<ref>C. P. Stacey, ''Canada and the Age of Conflict: A History of Canadian External Policies. Volume 2, 1921\u20131948: The Mackenzie King Era'' (1982) pp 420\u201322.</ref> and decided not to play a role in the Berlin airlift.<ref>Hector Mackenzie,  \"Golden Decade (s)?

It played a [[Canada and the United Nations|modest role in the postwar formation of the United Nations]], as well as the [[International Monetary Fund]]. It played a somewhat larger role in 1947 in designing the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]].<ref>Don Munton and John Kirton, eds. ''Cases and Readings in Canadian Foreign Policy Since World War II'' (1992) pp 2\u201318.</ref> Ties with Great Britain gradually weakened, especially in 1956 when Canada refused to support the British and French invasion of Egypt in order to seize the Suez Canal.  Liberal [[Lester B. Pearson]] as External Affairs Minister (foreign minister) won the Nobel Peace Prize for organizing the United Nations Emergency Force in 1956 to resolve the Suez Canal Crisis.<ref>Munton and Kirton, eds. ''Cases and Readings in Canadian Foreign Policy '' (1992) pp 58\u201377</ref>\n\nFrom 1939 to 1968, foreign policy was based on close relationships with the United States, especially in trade and defence policy, with Canada an active member of [[NATO]] as well as a bilateral partner with the United States in forming a northern defence against Soviet bombers. In 1950\u201353, Canada sent troops to the [[Korean War]] in defence of South Korea.<ref>Munton and Kirton, eds. ''Cases and Readings in Canadian Foreign Policy '' (1992) pp 27\u201342, 46\u201357.</ref>\n\nFor Lester Pearson, cultural differences, Francophone versus Anglophone, could perhaps be narrowed by involvement in world affairs. Canadians could gain a broader, more cosmopolitan, more liberal outlook. A sense of national identity, built on the middle size nation thesis, was possible.  Perhaps international commitment would produce a sense of purpose and thereby unite Canadians.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Bothwell|author2=Ian M. Drummond|author3=John English|title=Canada Since 1945: Power, Politics, and Provincialism|page=373}}</ref>\n\nThere were voices on both left and right that Warned against being too close to the United States. Few Canadians listened before 1957. Instead, there was wide consensus on Canadian foreign and defence policies 1948 to 1957.  Bothwell, Drummond and English state:\n:That support was remarkably uniform geographically and racially, both coast to coast and among French and English. From the CCF on the left to the Social Credit on the right, the political parties agreed that NATO was a good thing, and communism a bad thing, that a close association with Europe was desirable, and that the Commonwealth embodied a glorious past.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Bothwell|author2=Ian M.

By 1957 the Suez crisis alienated Canada from both Britain and France; politicians distrusted American leadership, businessmen questioned American financial investments; and intellectuals ridiculed the values of American television and Hollywood offerings that all Canadians watched. \"Public support for Canada's foreign policy big came unstuck. Foreign-policy, from being a winning issue for the Liberals, was fast becoming a losing one.\"<ref>Bothwell et al., p. 131</ref>\n\n===Since 1957===\n====Peacekeeping====\n{{Main|List of Canadian peacekeeping missions}}\nThe success of the Suez peacekeeping mission led Canadians to embrace peacekeeping as a suitable role for a middle-sized country, looking for a role, and having high regards for the United Nations.  This led to sending a peacekeeping force to Cyprus in 1964, when two NATO members, Greece and Turkey were at swords' point over ethnic violence in the historic British colony. The Canadians left in 1993 after 28 were killed and many wounded in the operation. Peacekeeping help was needed in the Belgian Congo in 1960\u201364, after Belgium pulled out. There were numerous other small interventions.  Canada took a central role in the International Control Commission (ICC), which tried to broker peace in Vietnam in the 1960s.<ref>Michael K.

US President Dwight Eisenhower took pains to foster good relations with Diefenbaker. That led to approval of plans to join the United States in what became known as NORAD, an integrated air defence system, in mid-1957. Relations with President John Kennedy were much less cordial.  Diefenbaker opposed [[apartheid]] in the [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] and helped force it out of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. His [[Bomarc Missile Crisis|indecision on whether to accept Bomarc nuclear missiles]] from the United States led to his government's downfall.<ref>Soloman Gabriel, ''Foreign Policy of Canada: A Study in Diefenbaker's Years'' (1987).</ref>\n\nThe [[Vietnam War]] (1964\u20131975) was very unpopular in Canada, which provided only minimal diplomatic support and no military participation.  Liberal [[Lester B. Pearson]] as Prime Minister (1963\u20131968) avoided any involvement in Vietnam.<ref>Munton and Kirton, eds. ''Cases and Readings in Canadian Foreign Policy'' (1992) pp 135\u201362.</ref> Foreign affairs was not high on his agenda, as he concentrated on complex internal political problems.<ref>John English ''The Worldly Years: Life of Lester Pearson 1949\u20131972'' (2011).</ref>\n\nUnder Liberal Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] (1968\u20131979 and 1980\u20131984) foreign policy was much less important than internal unity.  There were multiple new approaches, some of which involved standing apart from the United States. Trudeau recognized communist China shortly before the United States did,<ref>Munton and Kirton, eds. ''Cases and Readings in Canadian Foreign Policy'' (1992) pp 227\u201336.</ref> improved relationships with the Soviet Union, and cut back on contributions to NATO. While not cutting back on trade with the United States, he did emphasize improved trade with Europe and Asia. By his third year in office, however, Trudeau launched a new initiatives, emphasizing Canada's role as a middle power with the ability to engage in active peacekeeping operations under the auspices of the United Nations.<ref>Laurence Cros, \"The Narrative of Canada as a Peacekeeping Nation since the 1990s: Permanence and Evolution of a National Paradigm.\" ''International Journal of Canadian Studies'' 52 (2015): 83\u2013106.</ref> Foreign aid was expanded, especially to the non-white Commonwealth.  Canada joined most of NATO in imposing sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Afghanistan in 1979\u201380.<ref>Munton and Kirton, eds.

However a growing focus on development, defence, and diplomacy in recent decades has produced a concentration of foreign aid funding to countries determined to be security risks to Canadian policy. For example, in 2004\u20132005 the largest recipients of Canada's official developmental assistance were [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]], two nations in conflict with the [[United States|United States of America]] and its allies at the time. The structural emphasis on security and industry development has contributed to a fixed foreign policy that generally fails to consider global health and international social and economic inequalities.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\">Spiegel, J.M., and R.

The foreign aid provided by the country became less \"people-centered\" and less health-related. Canada's contributions have been quite inconsistent with regards to human security, which indicates that the reputation that the country has built throughout the years, in fact, exceeds the country's actual record.

In response, the Americans in 1970 stated, \"We cannot accept the assertion of a Canadian claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada.... Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide.\" A compromise was reached in 1988, by an agreement on \"Arctic Cooperation,\" which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers \"will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada.\"  However the agreement did not alter either country's basic legal position.  Essentially, the Americans agreed to ask for the consent of the Government of Canada without conceding that they were obliged to.

Pearson Building]] is the home of [[Global Affairs Canada]]]]\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Canada}}\n\n===Colonial era===\nThe [[British North America]]n colonies which today constitute modern Canada had no control over their foreign affairs until the achievement of [[responsible government]] in the late 1840s. Up to that time, wars, negotiations and treaties were carried out by the British government to settle disputes concerning the colonies over fishing and boundaries and to promote trade.  Notable examples from the colonial period include the [[Nootka Convention]], the [[War of 1812]], the [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]], the [[Treaty of 1818]], the [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]], and the [[Oregon Treaty]]. Before the granting of [[responsible government]], British diplomats handled foreign affairs and had the goal of achieving British goals, especially peace with the United States; domestic Canadian interests were secondary.  The [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] of 1854 signalled an important change in relations between Britain and its North American colonies. In this treaty, the Canadas were allowed to impose tariff duties more favourable to a foreign country (the U.S.) than to Britain, a precedent that was extended by new tariffs in 1859, 1879 and 1887, despite angry demands on the part of British industrialists that these tariffs be disallowed by London.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ian Robertson|title=Sir Andrew Macphail: The Life and Legacy of a Canadian Man of Letters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_v2NCJ2T3oC&pg=PA90|year=2008|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |page=90}}</ref>\n\n===Dominion of Canada: 1867===\nSoon after Confederation, the first prime minister Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] appointed [[Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet|Sir John Rose]] as his lobbyist in London. When [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] became prime minister, he sent [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]] to represent Canada in Washington during British-American trade talks.  After the Conservative Party came back to power in 1878, the government sent [[Alexander Galt]] to London, as well as to France and Spain. Although the British government was concerned about this nascent Canadian diplomacy, it finally consented to giving Galt the formal title of [[High Commissioner]] in 1880.  A trade commissioner was appointed to Australia in 1894.  As High Commissioner, [[Charles Tupper]] helped negotiate an agreement with France in 1893 but it was countersigned by the British ambassador as the Queen's official representative to France.  Meanwhile, in 1882 the province of Quebec made its first of many forays into the international community by sending a representative, [[Hector Fabre]] to Paris in 1882.<ref>{{cite book|author=Garth Stevenson|title=Ex Uno Plures: Federal-Provincial Relations in Canada, 1867\u20131896|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3mbJIbrmfgUC&pg=PA96|year=1997|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |page=96}}</ref>\n\nCanada's responses to international events elsewhere were limited at this time.  During 1878 tensions between Britain and Russia, for example, Canada constructed a few limited defences but did little else. By the time of the [[Mahdist War|British campaign in Sudan of 1884\u201385]], however, Canada was expected to contribute troops.  Since Ottawa was reluctant to become involved, the [[Governor General of Canada]] privately raised 386 [[voyageurs]] at Britain's expense to help British forces on the [[Nile]] river.  By 1885, many Canadians offered to volunteer as part of a potential Canadian force, however the government declined to act.  This stood in sharp contrast to Australia ([[New South Wales]]), which raised and paid for its own troops.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roy MacLaren|title=Canadians on the Nile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MmCXB-9XLlEC&pg=PA171|year=2011|publisher=UBC Press|page=171}}</ref>\n\nThe first Canadian commercial representative abroad was [[John Short Larke]].

Alaska controlled all the possible ports of entry. Canada argued its boundary included the port of [[Skagway]], held by the U.S..

Conservatives under [[Robert Borden]] denounced it, saying it would integrate Canada's economy into that of the U.S. and loosen ties with Britain. The Conservative party won the [[1911 Canadian federal election]].<ref>{{cite book |first=L.

In 1920 Canada became a full member of the [[League of Nations]], and acted independently of London.  It was elected to the League Council (governing board) in 1927. It did not play a leading role, and generally opposed sanctions or military action by the League. The League was virtually defunct by 1939.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anique H.

In 1923, Canada independently signed the [[Halibut Treaty]] with the United States at Mackenzie King's insistence&nbsp;\u2013 the first time Canada signed a treaty without the British also signing it. In 1925, the government appointed a permanent diplomat to Geneva to deal with the [[League of Nations]] and [[International Labour Organization]]. Following the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], King appointed [[Vincent Massey]] as the first Canadian [[minister plenipotentiary]] in Washington (1926), raised the office in Paris to legation status under [[Philippe Roy]] (1928), and opened a legation in Tokyo with [[Herbert Marler]] as envoy (1929).\n\nCanada achieved legislative independence with the enactment of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, although British diplomatic missions continued to represent Canada in most countries throughout the 1930s.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Mackenzie King government strongly supported the appeasement policy of the Chamberlain government in London toward Nazi Germany.<ref>{{cite book|author=Norman Hillmer|title=Pearson: The Unlikely Gladiator|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ubz6aRRsFoC&pg=PA22|year=1999|page=22}}</ref><ref>Ritchie Ovendale, ''Appeasement and the English-Speaking World: Britain, the United States, the Dominions, and the Policy of Appeasement'' (1975)</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, Canada rapidly expanded its diplomatic missions abroad. While Canada hosted two major Allied conferences in Quebec in 1943 and 1944, neither Prime Minister Mackenzie King nor senior generals and admirals were invited to take part in any of the discussions.<ref>J.

Its current name is \"Canadian International Council\".  Under businessman Edgar Tarr, 1931 to 1950, the CIIA went beyond the original neutral and apolitical research role. Instead it championed Canadian national autonomy and sought to enlarge the nation's international role, while challenging British imperialism.  Numerous diplomats attended its conferences and supported its new mission.  Canada's foreign policy moved away from imperialism and toward the sort of anti-colonialism promoted by the United States. CIIA leaders and Canadian officials worked to encouraged nationalist forces in India, China, and Southeast Asia that sought to reject colonial rule and Western dominance.<ref>Priscilla Roberts,  \"Tweaking the Lion's Tail: Edgar J.

Pearson]]; they fondly call the 1940s and 1950s a \"golden era\" of Canadian foreign policy. It certainly stood apart from the embarrassing isolationism of the 1930s, which James Eayrs called a low, dishonest decade.\"<ref>James Eayrs, \"'A Low Dishonest Decade': Aspects of Canadian External Policy, 1931\u20131939,\" in Hugh L. Keenleyside et al., ''The Growth of Canadian Policies in External Affairs'' (1960) pp 59\u201380.</ref> However, the Golden Era tag has been challenged as a romantic exaggeration.  Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], working closely with his Foreign Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]], handled foreign relations 1945\u201348 in cautious fashion. Canada lent and donated over $2 billion to Britain to help it rebuild (by purchasing Canadian exports). It was elected to the UN Security Council. It helped design NATO. However, Mackenzie King rejected free trade with the United States,<ref>C. P. Stacey, ''Canada and the Age of Conflict: A History of Canadian External Policies.

It played a [[Canada and the United Nations|modest role in the postwar formation of the United Nations]], as well as the [[International Monetary Fund]].

''Cases and Readings in Canadian Foreign Policy '' (1992) pp 58\u201377</ref>\n\nFrom 1939 to 1968, foreign policy was based on close relationships with the United States, especially in trade and defence policy, with Canada an active member of [[NATO]] as well as a bilateral partner with the United States in forming a northern defence against Soviet bombers. In 1950\u201353, Canada sent troops to the [[Korean War]] in defence of South Korea.<ref>Munton and Kirton, eds. ''Cases and Readings in Canadian Foreign Policy '' (1992) pp 27\u201342, 46\u201357.</ref>\n\nFor Lester Pearson, cultural differences, Francophone versus Anglophone, could perhaps be narrowed by involvement in world affairs. Canadians could gain a broader, more cosmopolitan, more liberal outlook. A sense of national identity, built on the middle size nation thesis, was possible.  Perhaps international commitment would produce a sense of purpose and thereby unite Canadians.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Bothwell|author2=Ian M. Drummond|author3=John English|title=Canada Since 1945: Power, Politics, and Provincialism|page=373}}</ref>\n\nThere were voices on both left and right that Warned against being too close to the United States. Few Canadians listened before 1957. Instead, there was wide consensus on Canadian foreign and defence policies 1948 to 1957.  Bothwell, Drummond and English state:\n:That support was remarkably uniform geographically and racially, both coast to coast and among French and English. From the CCF on the left to the Social Credit on the right, the political parties agreed that NATO was a good thing, and communism a bad thing, that a close association with Europe was desirable, and that the Commonwealth embodied a glorious past.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Bothwell|author2=Ian M.

By 1957 the Suez crisis alienated Canada from both Britain and France; politicians distrusted American leadership, businessmen questioned American financial investments; and intellectuals ridiculed the values of American television and Hollywood offerings that all Canadians watched. \"Public support for Canada's foreign policy big came unstuck. Foreign-policy, from being a winning issue for the Liberals, was fast becoming a losing one.\"<ref>Bothwell et al., p. 131</ref>\n\n===Since 1957===\n====Peacekeeping====\n{{Main|List of Canadian peacekeeping missions}}\nThe success of the Suez peacekeeping mission led Canadians to embrace peacekeeping as a suitable role for a middle-sized country, looking for a role, and having high regards for the United Nations.  This led to sending a peacekeeping force to Cyprus in 1964, when two NATO members, Greece and Turkey were at swords' point over ethnic violence in the historic British colony. The Canadians left in 1993 after 28 were killed and many wounded in the operation. Peacekeeping help was needed in the Belgian Congo in 1960\u201364, after Belgium pulled out. There were numerous other small interventions.  Canada took a central role in the International Control Commission (ICC), which tried to broker peace in Vietnam in the 1960s.<ref>Michael K.

US President Dwight Eisenhower took pains to foster good relations with Diefenbaker. That led to approval of plans to join the United States in what became known as NORAD, an integrated air defence system, in mid-1957. Relations with President John Kennedy were much less cordial.  Diefenbaker opposed [[apartheid]] in the [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] and helped force it out of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. His [[Bomarc Missile Crisis|indecision on whether to accept Bomarc nuclear missiles]] from the United States led to his government's downfall.<ref>Soloman Gabriel, ''Foreign Policy of Canada: A Study in Diefenbaker's Years'' (1987).</ref>\n\nThe [[Vietnam War]] (1964\u20131975) was very unpopular in Canada, which provided only minimal diplomatic support and no military participation.  Liberal [[Lester B. Pearson]] as Prime Minister (1963\u20131968) avoided any involvement in Vietnam.<ref>Munton and Kirton, eds. ''Cases and Readings in Canadian Foreign Policy'' (1992) pp 135\u201362.</ref> Foreign affairs was not high on his agenda, as he concentrated on complex internal political problems.<ref>John English ''The Worldly Years: Life of Lester Pearson 1949\u20131972'' (2011).</ref>\n\nUnder Liberal Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] (1968\u20131979 and 1980\u20131984) foreign policy was much less important than internal unity.  There were multiple new approaches, some of which involved standing apart from the United States. Trudeau recognized communist China shortly before the United States did,<ref>Munton and Kirton, eds. ''Cases and Readings in Canadian Foreign Policy'' (1992) pp 227\u201336.</ref> improved relationships with the Soviet Union, and cut back on contributions to NATO. While not cutting back on trade with the United States, he did emphasize improved trade with Europe and Asia. By his third year in office, however, Trudeau launched a new initiatives, emphasizing Canada's role as a middle power with the ability to engage in active peacekeeping operations under the auspices of the United Nations.<ref>Laurence Cros, \"The Narrative of Canada as a Peacekeeping Nation since the 1990s: Permanence and Evolution of a National Paradigm.\" ''International Journal of Canadian Studies'' 52 (2015): 83\u2013106.</ref> Foreign aid was expanded, especially to the non-white Commonwealth.

Traditionally the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] has played a prominent role in foreign affairs decisions.  Foreign aid, formerly delivered through the [[Canadian International Development Agency]], has been administered by DFATD since March 2013.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

In March 2013 CIDA ceased to exist when it was folded into DFAIT, creating DFATD.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\"/> The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the [[Millennium Development Goals]], while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises. However a growing focus on development, defence, and diplomacy in recent decades has produced a concentration of foreign aid funding to countries determined to be security risks to Canadian policy. For example, in 2004\u20132005 the largest recipients of Canada's official developmental assistance were [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]], two nations in conflict with the [[United States|United States of America]] and its allies at the time. The structural emphasis on security and industry development has contributed to a fixed foreign policy that generally fails to consider global health and international social and economic inequalities.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\">Spiegel, J.M., and R.

The foreign aid provided by the country became less \"people-centered\" and less health-related. Canada's contributions have been quite inconsistent with regards to human security, which indicates that the reputation that the country has built throughout the years, in fact, exceeds the country's actual record. Canada's contributions internationally have been detrimental and crucial but it needs redirecting back to its original goals.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\"/>\n\n===Federalism and foreign relations===\nThe provinces have a high level of freedom to operate internationally, dating from [[Quebec]]'s first representative to France in 1886, [[Hector Fabre]].

Likewise, Canada and France had previously contested the maritime boundary surrounding the islands of [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon|St. Pierre and Miquelon]], but accepted a 1992 [[International Court of Arbitration]] ruling.\n\nRemaining disputes include managed maritime boundary disputes with the US ([[Dixon Entrance]], [[Beaufort Sea]], [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], [[Machias Seal Island]]).\n\n===Arctic disputes===\nA long-simmering dispute between Canada and the U.S. involves the issue of Canadian sovereignty over the [[Northwest Passage]] (the sea passages in the Arctic).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Canada's assertion that the Northwest Passage represents internal (territorial) waters has been challenged by other countries, especially the U.S., which argue that these waters constitute an international strait (international waters). Canadians were incensed when Americans drove the reinforced oil tanker Manhattan through the Northwest Passage in 1969, followed by the icebreaker [[USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11)|Polar Sea]] in 1985, both without asking for Canadian permission.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  In 1970, the Canadian government enacted the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, which asserts Canadian regulatory control over pollution within a {{convert|100|nmi|km|adj=on}} zone.  In response, the Americans in 1970 stated, \"We cannot accept the assertion of a Canadian claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada.... Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide.\" A compromise was reached in 1988, by an agreement on \"Arctic Cooperation,\" which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers \"will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada.\"  However the agreement did not alter either country's basic legal position.  Essentially, the Americans agreed to ask for the consent of the Government of Canada without conceding that they were obliged to.  In January 2006, David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Canada, said his government opposes Stephen Harper's proposed plan to deploy military icebreakers in the Arctic to detect interlopers and assert Canadian sovereignty over those waters.\n<ref>Matthew Carnaghan, Allison Goody, \"Canadian Arctic Sovereignty\" (Library of Parliament: Political and Social Affairs Division, 26 January 2006) at [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/prb0561-e.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209140412/http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/prb0561-e.htm |date=9 February 2010 }}; 2006 news at [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/01/26/wilkins-harper060126.html]</ref>\n\nAlso, there is a dispute with Denmark over the sovereignty of the uninhabited [[Hans Island]] and surrounding waters in the Kennedy Channel between [[Ellesmere Island]] and [[Greenland]].\n\nAlong with other nations in the [[Arctic Council]], Canada, Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Russia, the maritime boundaries in the far north will be decided after countries have completed their submissions, due in 2012.

Walker understood the power of advertising and brand awareness. Heavy advertising, primarily in African-American newspapers and magazines, in addition to Walker's frequent travels to promote her products, helped make Walker and her products well known in the United States.\n\nIn addition to training in sales and grooming, Walker showed other black women how to budget, build their own businesses, and encouraged them to become financially independent. In 1917, inspired by the model of the [[National Association of Colored Women]], Walker began organizing her sales agents into state and local clubs. The result was the establishment of the National Beauty Culturists and Benevolent Association of Madam C. J. Walker Agents (predecessor to the Madam C. J. Walker Beauty Culturists Union of America).<ref name=\"indiana-history\" /> Its first annual conference convened in [[Philadelphia]] during the summer of 1917 with 200 attendees.

Walker understood the power of advertising and brand awareness. Heavy advertising, primarily in African-American newspapers and magazines, in addition to Walker's frequent travels to promote her products, helped make Walker and her products well known in the United States.\n\nIn addition to training in sales and grooming, Walker showed other black women how to budget, build their own businesses, and encouraged them to become financially independent. In 1917, inspired by the model of the [[National Association of Colored Women]], Walker began organizing her sales agents into state and local clubs. The result was the establishment of the National Beauty Culturists and Benevolent Association of Madam C. J. Walker Agents (predecessor to the Madam C. J. Walker Beauty Culturists Union of America).<ref name=\"indiana-history\" /> Its first annual conference convened in [[Philadelphia]] during the summer of 1917 with 200 attendees.

He was employed by the [[Leicestershire County Council]] as the officer-in-charge of several children's homes in [[Leicestershire]], between 1973 and 1986. Though holding only a 'middle management' grade within the hierarchy of Leicestershire Social Services, Beck quickly established an esteemed reputation among his professional peers as an innovative, dynamic and extraordinarily effective practitioner in dealing with the emotional and behavioural complexities of troubled young people placed in his charge. Beck was later at the centre of Britain's biggest investigation into institutional child abuse, between 1989 and 1991.\n\n==Background and route into social work==\n\nBorn in [[Salisbury]], Beck was raised in [[Thornton Heath]], [[Croydon]], the son of a train driver and the youngest of five children. Leaving secondary modern school without any qualifications, Beck trained to be a pig keeper and spent three years working on a farm before joining the [[Royal Marines]].\n\nBeck spent ten years as a marine, serving in [[Borneo]] and [[Aden]] and attaining the rank of sergeant. Emerging with an honourable discharge and campaign medals in June 1969,<ref>https://spotlightonabuse.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/exp301191b.jpg</ref> Beck apparently turned down officer training and chose instead to train as a social worker.\n\nBeck subsequently obtained employment with [[Northampton]] Social Services and went into a training course at the [[Stevenage]] College of Further Education, where he acquired a Certificate of Qualification in Social Work (CQSW) and a Home Office Letter of Recognition in Child Care. Beck then gained employment with Leicestershire Social Services in August 1973<Ref>http://www.childrenshomes.org.uk/LeicestershireCC/KirkwoodInquiry.pdf</ref>. He started work on 1 September and served as officer-in-charge of three local authority children's homes until his resignation in March 1986. The children's homes concerned were The Poplars Children's Home, [[Market Harborough]] (1973\u201375); Ratcliffe Road Children's Home, [[Leicester]] (1975\u201378) and The Beeches Children's Home, [[Leicester Forest East]] (1978 - 1986)\n\n==Character and attributes==\n\nAn ex-Royal Marine sergeant, he was described as \"tough, uncompromising and very, very strong\", with arms \"... as thick as the thighs of the children in his care\".<ref>'Abuse of Trust: Frank Beck and the Leicestershire Children's Homes Scandal', by Mark D'Arcy and Paul Gosling, Bowerdean Publishing Co, 1998, page 12.</ref>\n\nIn addition to his physical strength and fitness, Beck also seems to have exuded extraordinary charisma and despite a limited educational background he possessed a sharp intellect, eloquence and critical ability which, combined with the outstanding success he seemed to have in bringing the most wayward and behaviourally challenging children to order led to positive comments from his superiors. Dorothy Edwards, the Director of Social Services (1973\u201380) reportedly told a friend, \"I don't know quite what he's doing, but he's doing it very well.\"<ref name=autogenerated1>Richard Webster, Times Literary Supplement, 22 January 1999.</ref>\n\nBeck was also a local politician, being elected in 1983 as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] councillor to a seat on the [[Blaby]] District Council, which he successfully defended in 1987.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/notorious-child-sex-offender-dies-in-prison-the-trial-and-conviction-of-frank-beck-followed-britains-biggest-investigation-into-child-abuse-rosie-waterhouse-reports-1419811.html Notorious child sex offender dies in prison: The trial and conviction of Frank Beck followed Britain's biggest investigation into child abuse. Rosie Waterhouse reports - UK - ...<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==System of abuse==\n\nBeck is said to have used his own brand of 'regression therapy' as a cover for sexually abusing children in his care - supposedly a method of digging down to the roots of children's emotional problems, by returning them to a state of infancy. Children were dressed in pyjamas and given bottles and dummies; some of the younger children were dressed in nappies. At meal times, staff would sometimes cut up the food on the plates of residents, as if feeding infants; children would be given toys designed for much younger children and sometimes bathed by staff members and Beck encouraged a culture of cuddling and bodily contact.<ref>D'Arcy and Gosling, page 28.</ref>\n\nBeck also believed that emotions should not be 'bottled up' and it is said that children were deliberately provoked into temper tantrums, thereby creating opportunities to exercise violent physical restraint.<ref>D'Arcy and Gosling, page 29.</ref>  \nResidential Social Workers were often hand-picked by Beck and were required to support his methods and philosophy without question. Several of his staff were also paedophiles and sadists, including Colin Fiddaman, who was to kill himself in Amsterdam, whilst on the run, in 1991. Beck is also said to have physically and sexually abused male members of staff, sustaining 'a regime of terror' for thirteen years.\n\n==Allegations, investigation and arrest==\n\nDuring the early 1980s, the number of complaints made about Beck's deployment of sexual and physical abuse and the unconventional methods he used as a child-care practitioner began to escalate. Complaints and concerns were aired not just by the young people in his 'care', but also by other members of staff and visiting professional agencies. In 1983, Beck was charged with actual bodily harm against a 10-year-old boy who had been severely bruised across the buttocks after Beck had 'spanked' him. The boy had stayed at The Beeches Children's Home in Leicester for weekend respite care and Beck was subsequently arrested after the child's mother reported matters to the police. Beck was duly acquitted at the ensuing trial and benefited from adulatory testimonials of support elicited from other members of staff; such was the belief in Beck's professional integrity among senior managers of Leicestershire Social Services that it was not even deemed necessary to suspend him from duty, pending the outcome of the allegation.\n\nBeck's seemingly 'bomb-proof' invincibility saw him fend off a continued escalation of complaints, until finally, in March 1986, his career in Leicestershire was ended by a complaint of sexual abuse made by two male residential social workers at The Beeches, who claimed that Beck had made advances toward them during staff supervision sessions. This time, Beck ''was'' suspended from duty and he subsequently handed in his resignation rather than subject himself to investigations under the council's protracted disciplinary procedures and risk dismissal.\n\nBeck's resignation letter implicitly admitted the truth of the complaints (while at the same time calling them 'overstated'). \"I cannot say how sorry I am\", he wrote.\n\nFollowing temporary menial employment as a security guard, Beck later attempted to resurrect his social work career with 'Reliance Social Care', an agency supplying staff to social services departments in London. A reference was supplied to them by Brian Rice, the Director of Leicestershire Social Services who had replaced Dorothy Edwards in 1980 and which gave a positive appraisal of Beck's abilities in working with young people, with only a suggestion that the agency might wish to discuss with him the exact reasons for his resignation.<ref>D'Arcy and Gosling, page 121.</ref> The same reference enabled him to gain a post at the Woodcock Hill Children's Home in Brent and he later moved on to [[Hertfordshire]], where he was accused of sexual relationships with two clients, one an adolescent boy.<ref>D'Arcy and Gosling, page 121/2.</ref>\n\nThe complaint that finally led to Beck's last arrest came from a young mother who had formerly been in Beck's care at the Ratcliffe Road Children's Home. In 1989, she made disclosures of historical abuse suffered under the Beck regime, whilst attending parent-craft meetings run by her social worker at the Regent Street Nursery in [[Loughborough]], Leicestershire. The social worker took these allegations to the police and helped pave the way for Britain's largest investigation into institutionalised child abuse. It led to police taking statements from nearly four hundred children in an operation which lasted for two and a half years, conducted by more than thirty police officers. Under the direction of the [[Leicestershire Constabulary]], various other police authorities traced and interviewed former children in care across four continents.<ref>D'Arcy and Gosling, page 124.</ref>\n\nAt approximately 7.35 am on 14 April 1990, police officers executed a warrant of arrest at Beck's home in [[Braunstone Park & Rowley Fields|Braunstone, Leicester]]<ref>[https://ianpace.wordpress.com/2014/05/24/full-set-of-reports-from-the-1991-frank-beck-trial-1-2/ Full set of reports from the 1991 Frank Beck Trial #1 | Desiring Progress] Retrieved 2018-03-07.</ref> and informed him that he was being arrested after an investigation into sexual misconduct in Leicestershire children's homes during the 1970s and 1980s.

It bears little resemblance to the photograph of Beck within the book, which shows him as a burly and confident much younger man, depicted outside the Beeches Children's Home at Leicester Forest East during the 1980s.\n\n==Richard Webster: criticism of D'Arcy and Gosling==\n{{over-quotation|section|date=January 2016}}\n''Abuse of Trust'' was heavily criticised by [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]], a writer who suggested that hysteria lay behind some abuse scandals, particularly in the case of Frank Beck.\n\nWebster did not seek to advocate the innocence of Beck, nor his guilt, but was strongly critical of what he perceived as the inherent bias of D'Arcy and Gosling in setting out to create a work that was fervently determined from the outset to portray him as \"a proven monster\" and disregarding any evidence to suggest that prosecution evidence against him may have been tainted.\n\nWebster wrote: \"Beck always maintained that he had never sexually abused anyone in his care. Far more importantly, he had convinced two key members of his legal team of his innocence. One of these was Ian Henning, a gifted legal executive (and former policeman) who had taken charge of Beck's defence. The other was Bernard Greaves, the former policy adviser to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. When Greaves first met Beck, he did not believe his denials. But wherever documentary evidence was available, he found it confirmed what Beck had said \u2013 that he could not have committed the offences in question. The more they worked on the case, the more Henning and Greaves became convinced that Beck had become the victim of an unprecedented trawling operation in which police officers, in their anxiety to gain a conviction, had inadvertently suggested allegations to the witness they were interviewing. Largely as a result of the work done by his defence team, Beck was acquitted on half the charges he faced. Henning and Greaves were preparing his appeal when Beck died of a heart attack in prison.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nWebster continued: \"To say this is not to endorse the view that Beck was completely innocent. Now that both Beck and Henning are dead, it will probably never be possible to establish the true facts about the case. But there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that the kind of police investigation mounted into Frank Beck was intrinsically unsafe. The alarming thing is the way in which this evidence has been conjured into virtual invisibility by D\u2019Arcy and Gosling\".<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nWebster was also highly critical of the suggestion by D'Arcy and Gosling that Beck had murdered Simon O'Donnell, an adolescent boy formerly in his care. Webster pointed out that the only evidence D'Arcy and Gosling have for making this claim was that produced by Peter Bastin, himself a convicted rapist and murderer. Webster points out that Bastin's evidence was produced during a lucrative compensation hearing. \"Twenty-one years after a verdict of suicide was returned on a thirteen-year-old boy who had been in Beck\u2019s care, this man claimed that he had looked out of the window on the night in question and seen Beck and Fiddaman carrying 'something wrapped in a blanket', which he now, in 1998, believes was the body of the boy,\" wrote Webster. \"Although it bears many of the marks of being an opportunistic fabrication, D'Arcy and Gosling treat it with respect.... The handling of Bastin's story should in itself be sufficient to undermine the reader's faith in the authors' judgment.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/becks-appalling-crimes-just-the-tip-of-child-abuse-scandal-702598.html/ Report from The Independent Newspaper]\n* [http://www.richardwebster.net/crusadeorwitchhunt.html Times Literary Supplement, Article by Richard Webster, 22 January 1999]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beck, Frank}}\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:1994 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century English criminals]]\n[[Category:English people convicted of child sexual abuse]]\n[[Category:English people who died in prison custody]]\n[[Category:Child sexual abuse in England]]\n[[Category:Incidents of violence against boys]]\n[[Category:Councillors in Leicestershire]]\n[[Category:Criminals from Wiltshire]]\n[[Category:English prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment]]\n[[Category:English social workers]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (UK) councillors]]\n[[Category:People from Leicester]]\n[[Category:People from Salisbury]]\n[[Category:Prisoners who died in England and Wales detention]]\n[[Category:Royal Marines ranks]]\n[[Category:Sexual abuse cover-ups]]\n[[Category:Rape of males]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox criminal\n| name = Frank Beck\n| image = \n| image_size = \n| alt = \n| caption = \n| birth_name = \n| birth_date = {{birth date|df=yes|1942|07|19}}\n| birth_place = [[Salisbury]], [[Wiltshire]], England\n| death_date = {{death date and age|df=yes|1994|05|31|1942|07|19}}\n| death_place = [[Whitemoor (HM Prison)|Whitemoor Prison]], [[Cambridgeshire]], England\n| resting_place = \n| residence = \n| other_names = \n| occupation = Officer-in-charge of several children's homes\n| known_for = Convicted child sex offender\n| height = \n| weight = \n| predecessor = \n| successor = \n| religion = \n| criminal_charge = Sexual and physical assaults\n| penalty = Five life-terms\n| conviction_status = \n| spouse =         <!-- Do not include unless notable or relevant to the crime involved -->\n| children =       <!-- (as above) -->\n| parents =        <!-- (as above) -->\n| allegiance =     <!-- [[Lucchese crime family]] (only?) -->\n| motive = \n| conviction = \n| reward_amount = \n| capture_status = \n| wanted_by = \n| partners = \n| wanted_since = \n| time_at_large = \n| escaped = \n| escape_end = \n| comments = \n| victims = \n| date = \n| time = \n| beginyear = \n| endyear = \n| country = \n| states = \n| locations = \n| targets = \n| fatalities = \n| injuries = \n| weapons = \n| apprehended = \n| imprisoned = \n| footnotes = \n}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\n'''Frank Beck''' (19 July 1942 \u2013 31 May 1994) was an English convicted child [[sex offender]]. He was employed by the [[Leicestershire County Council]] as the officer-in-charge of several children's homes in [[Leicestershire]], between 1973 and 1986. Though holding only a 'middle management' grade within the hierarchy of Leicestershire Social Services, Beck quickly established an esteemed reputation among his professional peers as an innovative, dynamic and extraordinarily effective practitioner in dealing with the emotional and behavioural complexities of troubled young people placed in his charge. Beck was later at the centre of Britain's biggest investigation into institutional child abuse, between 1989 and 1991.\n\n==Background and route into social work==\n\nBorn in [[Salisbury]], Beck was raised in [[Thornton Heath]], [[Croydon]], the son of a train driver and the youngest of five children. Leaving secondary modern school without any qualifications, Beck trained to be a pig keeper and spent three years working on a farm before joining the [[Royal Marines]].\n\nBeck spent ten years as a marine, serving in [[Borneo]] and [[Aden]] and attaining the rank of sergeant. Emerging with an honourable discharge and campaign medals in June 1969,<ref>https://spotlightonabuse.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/exp301191b.jpg</ref> Beck apparently turned down officer training and chose instead to train as a social worker.\n\nBeck subsequently obtained employment with [[Northampton]] Social Services and went into a training course at the [[Stevenage]] College of Further Education, where he acquired a Certificate of Qualification in Social Work (CQSW) and a Home Office Letter of Recognition in Child Care. Beck then gained employment with Leicestershire Social Services in August 1973<Ref>http://www.childrenshomes.org.uk/LeicestershireCC/KirkwoodInquiry.pdf</ref>. He started work on 1 September and served as officer-in-charge of three local authority children's homes until his resignation in March 1986. The children's homes concerned were The Poplars Children's Home, [[Market Harborough]] (1973\u201375); Ratcliffe Road Children's Home, [[Leicester]] (1975\u201378) and The Beeches Children's Home, [[Leicester Forest East]] (1978 - 1986)\n\n==Character and attributes==\n\nAn ex-Royal Marine sergeant, he was described as \"tough, uncompromising and very, very strong\", with arms \"... as thick as the thighs of the children in his care\".<ref>'Abuse of Trust: Frank Beck and the Leicestershire Children's Homes Scandal', by Mark D'Arcy and Paul Gosling, Bowerdean Publishing Co, 1998, page 12.</ref>\n\nIn addition to his physical strength and fitness, Beck also seems to have exuded extraordinary charisma and despite a limited educational background he possessed a sharp intellect, eloquence and critical ability which, combined with the outstanding success he seemed to have in bringing the most wayward and behaviourally challenging children to order led to positive comments from his superiors. Dorothy Edwards, the Director of Social Services (1973\u201380) reportedly told a friend, \"I don't know quite what he's doing, but he's doing it very well.\"<ref name=autogenerated1>Richard Webster, Times Literary Supplement, 22 January 1999.</ref>\n\nBeck was also a local politician, being elected in 1983 as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] councillor to a seat on the [[Blaby]] District Council, which he successfully defended in 1987.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/notorious-child-sex-offender-dies-in-prison-the-trial-and-conviction-of-frank-beck-followed-britains-biggest-investigation-into-child-abuse-rosie-waterhouse-reports-1419811.html Notorious child sex offender dies in prison: The trial and conviction of Frank Beck followed Britain's biggest investigation into child abuse. Rosie Waterhouse reports - UK - ...<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==System of abuse==\n\nBeck is said to have used his own brand of 'regression therapy' as a cover for sexually abusing children in his care - supposedly a method of digging down to the roots of children's emotional problems, by returning them to a state of infancy. Children were dressed in pyjamas and given bottles and dummies; some of the younger children were dressed in nappies. At meal times, staff would sometimes cut up the food on the plates of residents, as if feeding infants; children would be given toys designed for much younger children and sometimes bathed by staff members and Beck encouraged a culture of cuddling and bodily contact.<ref>D'Arcy and Gosling, page 28.</ref>\n\nBeck also believed that emotions should not be 'bottled up' and it is said that children were deliberately provoked into temper tantrums, thereby creating opportunities to exercise violent physical restraint.<ref>D'Arcy and Gosling, page 29.</ref>  \nResidential Social Workers were often hand-picked by Beck and were required to support his methods and philosophy without question. Several of his staff were also paedophiles and sadists, including Colin Fiddaman, who was to kill himself in Amsterdam, whilst on the run, in 1991. Beck is also said to have physically and sexually abused male members of staff, sustaining 'a regime of terror' for thirteen years.\n\n==Allegations, investigation and arrest==\n\nDuring the early 1980s, the number of complaints made about Beck's deployment of sexual and physical abuse and the unconventional methods he used as a child-care practitioner began to escalate. Complaints and concerns were aired not just by the young people in his 'care', but also by other members of staff and visiting professional agencies. In 1983, Beck was charged with actual bodily harm against a 10-year-old boy who had been severely bruised across the buttocks after Beck had 'spanked' him. The boy had stayed at The Beeches Children's Home in Leicester for weekend respite care and Beck was subsequently arrested after the child's mother reported matters to the police. Beck was duly acquitted at the ensuing trial and benefited from adulatory testimonials of support elicited from other members of staff; such was the belief in Beck's professional integrity among senior managers of Leicestershire Social Services that it was not even deemed necessary to suspend him from duty, pending the outcome of the allegation.\n\nBeck's seemingly 'bomb-proof' invincibility saw him fend off a continued escalation of complaints, until finally, in March 1986, his career in Leicestershire was ended by a complaint of sexual abuse made by two male residential social workers at The Beeches, who claimed that Beck had made advances toward them during staff supervision sessions. This time, Beck ''was'' suspended from duty and he subsequently handed in his resignation rather than subject himself to investigations under the council's protracted disciplinary procedures and risk dismissal.\n\nBeck's resignation letter implicitly admitted the truth of the complaints (while at the same time calling them 'overstated'). \"I cannot say how sorry I am\", he wrote.\n\nFollowing temporary menial employment as a security guard, Beck later attempted to resurrect his social work career with 'Reliance Social Care', an agency supplying staff to social services departments in London. A reference was supplied to them by Brian Rice, the Director of Leicestershire Social Services who had replaced Dorothy Edwards in 1980 and which gave a positive appraisal of Beck's abilities in working with young people, with only a suggestion that the agency might wish to discuss with him the exact reasons for his resignation.<ref>D'Arcy and Gosling, page 121.</ref> The same reference enabled him to gain a post at the Woodcock Hill Children's Home in Brent and he later moved on to [[Hertfordshire]], where he was accused of sexual relationships with two clients, one an adolescent boy.<ref>D'Arcy and Gosling, page 121/2.</ref>\n\nThe complaint that finally led to Beck's last arrest came from a young mother who had formerly been in Beck's care at the Ratcliffe Road Children's Home. In 1989, she made disclosures of historical abuse suffered under the Beck regime, whilst attending parent-craft meetings run by her social worker at the Regent Street Nursery in [[Loughborough]], Leicestershire. The social worker took these allegations to the police and helped pave the way for Britain's largest investigation into institutionalised child abuse. It led to police taking statements from nearly four hundred children in an operation which lasted for two and a half years, conducted by more than thirty police officers. Under the direction of the [[Leicestershire Constabulary]], various other police authorities traced and interviewed former children in care across four continents.<ref>D'Arcy and Gosling, page 124.</ref>\n\nAt approximately 7.35 am on 14 April 1990, police officers executed a warrant of arrest at Beck's home in [[Braunstone Park & Rowley Fields|Braunstone, Leicester]]<ref>[https://ianpace.wordpress.com/2014/05/24/full-set-of-reports-from-the-1991-frank-beck-trial-1-2/ Full set of reports from the 1991 Frank Beck Trial #1 | Desiring Progress] Retrieved 2018-03-07.</ref> and informed him that he was being arrested after an investigation into sexual misconduct in Leicestershire children's homes during the 1970s and 1980s.

It bears little resemblance to the photograph of Beck within the book, which shows him as a burly and confident much younger man, depicted outside the Beeches Children's Home at Leicester Forest East during the 1980s.\n\n==Richard Webster: criticism of D'Arcy and Gosling==\n{{over-quotation|section|date=January 2016}}\n''Abuse of Trust'' was heavily criticised by [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]], a writer who suggested that hysteria lay behind some abuse scandals, particularly in the case of Frank Beck.\n\nWebster did not seek to advocate the innocence of Beck, nor his guilt, but was strongly critical of what he perceived as the inherent bias of D'Arcy and Gosling in setting out to create a work that was fervently determined from the outset to portray him as \"a proven monster\" and disregarding any evidence to suggest that prosecution evidence against him may have been tainted.\n\nWebster wrote: \"Beck always maintained that he had never sexually abused anyone in his care. Far more importantly, he had convinced two key members of his legal team of his innocence. One of these was Ian Henning, a gifted legal executive (and former policeman) who had taken charge of Beck's defence. The other was Bernard Greaves, the former policy adviser to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. When Greaves first met Beck, he did not believe his denials. But wherever documentary evidence was available, he found it confirmed what Beck had said \u2013 that he could not have committed the offences in question. The more they worked on the case, the more Henning and Greaves became convinced that Beck had become the victim of an unprecedented trawling operation in which police officers, in their anxiety to gain a conviction, had inadvertently suggested allegations to the witness they were interviewing. Largely as a result of the work done by his defence team, Beck was acquitted on half the charges he faced. Henning and Greaves were preparing his appeal when Beck died of a heart attack in prison.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nWebster continued: \"To say this is not to endorse the view that Beck was completely innocent. Now that both Beck and Henning are dead, it will probably never be possible to establish the true facts about the case. But there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that the kind of police investigation mounted into Frank Beck was intrinsically unsafe. The alarming thing is the way in which this evidence has been conjured into virtual invisibility by D\u2019Arcy and Gosling\".<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nWebster was also highly critical of the suggestion by D'Arcy and Gosling that Beck had murdered Simon O'Donnell, an adolescent boy formerly in his care. Webster pointed out that the only evidence D'Arcy and Gosling have for making this claim was that produced by Peter Bastin, himself a convicted rapist and murderer. Webster points out that Bastin's evidence was produced during a lucrative compensation hearing. \"Twenty-one years after a verdict of suicide was returned on a thirteen-year-old boy who had been in Beck\u2019s care, this man claimed that he had looked out of the window on the night in question and seen Beck and Fiddaman carrying 'something wrapped in a blanket', which he now, in 1998, believes was the body of the boy,\" wrote Webster. \"Although it bears many of the marks of being an opportunistic fabrication, D'Arcy and Gosling treat it with respect.... The handling of Bastin's story should in itself be sufficient to undermine the reader's faith in the authors' judgment.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/becks-appalling-crimes-just-the-tip-of-child-abuse-scandal-702598.html/ Report from The Independent Newspaper]\n* [http://www.richardwebster.net/crusadeorwitchhunt.html Times Literary Supplement, Article by Richard Webster, 22 January 1999]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beck, Frank}}\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:1994 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century English criminals]]\n[[Category:English people convicted of child sexual abuse]]\n[[Category:English people who died in prison custody]]\n[[Category:Child sexual abuse in England]]\n[[Category:Incidents of violence against boys]]\n[[Category:Councillors in Leicestershire]]\n[[Category:Criminals from Wiltshire]]\n[[Category:English prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment]]\n[[Category:English social workers]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (UK) councillors]]\n[[Category:People from Leicester]]\n[[Category:People from Salisbury]]\n[[Category:Prisoners who died in England and Wales detention]]\n[[Category:Royal Marines ranks]]\n[[Category:Sexual abuse cover-ups]]\n", "name_user": "2604:6000:b182:8d00:39b6:8579:2a68:afe5", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Beck_(sex_offender)"}

Then, for the patient to exhale, the air inside the cylinder is compressed slightly (or allowed to equalize to ambient room pressure), causing the patient's chest and abdomen to partially collapse, forcing air out of the lungs, as the patient exhales the breath through their exposed mouth and nose, outside the cylinder.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" /><ref name=\"how_does_iron_lung_work_2018_08_21_newsweek\" />\n\nExamples of the device include the Drinker respirator, the Emerson respirator, and the Both respirator.

A modern version is the ''exovent.''   A lightweight variation on the cuirass ventilator is the ''jacket ventilator'' or ''poncho'' or ''raincoat''  ventilator, which uses a flexible, impermeable material (such as plastic or rubber) stretched over a metal or plastic frame over the patient's torso.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"modern_iron_lung_2020_04_06_newatlas\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_and_2020_04_11_oxy_gen\">[http://oxygen.milano.it/en/the-iron-lung-and-the-modern-ventilation/ \"The 'iron lung' and the modern 'ventilation',\"] Oxy.gen, \nretrieved April 11, 2020 (caution: source unclear; apparently an Italian oxygen-supplier)</ref><ref name=\"poncho_dima_italia_sri\">[https://www.dimaitalia.com/en/tag/poncho/ \"Poncho,\"] by medical device manufacturer [[Dima Italia Srl]] of [[Bologna, Italy]] (picture of jacket ventilator (\"poncho\"), and other information.), retrieved April 12, 2020</ref>\n\n==Method and use==\n===normal breathing===\n\nHumans, like most mammals, breathe by ''negative pressure'' breathing:<ref name=stemnet>{{cite web|title=Gas Exchange in Humans|url=http://www.stemnet.nf.ca/~dpower/resp/exchange.htm|accessdate=2011-07-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423113840/http://www.stemnet.nf.ca/~dpower/resp/exchange.htm|archivedate=2009-04-23}}</ref> the rib cage expands and the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] contracts, expanding the [[chest cavity]]. This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head -- which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth, which remain exposed to outside (\"ambient\") air. A pump (typically a mechanically-powered diaphragm) momentarily reduces the air pressure inside the iron lung, to a pressure lower than outside (ambient) air.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThis causes the air within the iron lung, but outside the chest wall, to be at a lower pressure than the air inside the patient's lungs (thus, the term \"negative pressure\"), so the patient's lungs and chest expand to equalize their air pressure to the lower pressure of the interior of the iron lung.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nNow, the expanded lungs are at a lower pressure than the \"ambient\" air outside the iron lung.

Emerson defended himself by making the case that such lifesaving devices should be freely available to all.<ref name=NMAH2011/> Emerson also demonstrated that every aspect of Drinker's patents had been published or used by others at earlier times. Since an invention must be novel to be patentable, prior publication/use of the invention meant it was not novel and therefore unpatentable. Emerson won the case, and Drinker's patents were declared invalid.\n\nThe United Kingdom's first iron lung was designed in 1934 by Robert Henderson, an Aberdeen doctor. Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s, and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis. Despite this success, Henderson was reprimanded for secretly using hospital facilities to build the machine.<ref name=\"Wills\">{{cite book| last=Wills| first=Elspeth| title=Scottish Firsts: A Celebration of Innovation and Achievement| publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]| location=Edinburgh| year=2002| pages=[https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51 51\u20132]| isbn=978-1840186116| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web| last=Thomas| first=Campbell| date=15 February 2000| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/dr-robert-henderson-1.249085| title=Dr Robert Henderson | work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]| accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Both respirator===\n[[File:Both Cabinet Respirator in WWII.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Both cabinet respirator being used to treat a patient at the 110th Australian Military Hospital in 1943]]\n{{main|Both respirator}}\nThe [[Both respirator]], a negative pressure ventilator, was invented in 1937 when Australia's epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure.

It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions,<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /> such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.

This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head -- which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth, which remain exposed to outside (\"ambient\") air.

In 1959, there were 1,200 people using tank respirators in the United States, but by 2004 there were only 39.<ref name=\"NMAH\" /> By 2014, there were only 10 people left with an iron lung.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/24/north-texan-one-of-10-still-living-in-iron-lung/| title=North Texan one of 10 still living in iron lung| first=Shelly| last=Conlon| date=24 August 2014| agency=Associated Press| publisher=The Washington Times| accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Replacement ===\n[[Positive pressure ventilation]] systems are now more common than negative pressure systems. Positive pressure ventilators work by blowing air into the patient's lungs via [[intubation]] through the airway; they were used for the first time in [[Blegdams Hospital]], [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, during a polio outbreak in 1952.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=Reisner2009>{{cite web|author=Louise Reisner-S\u00e9n\u00e9lar|title=The Danish anaesthesiologist Bj\u00f6rn Ibsen a pioneer of long-term ventilation on the upper airways|year=2009|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B7CdB217pf6yN2QxOGI5NTUtZWIzYS00N2NhLWFhODQtOGZjMjdhZTlkZGE5&hl=de|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref><ref name=Wackers1994>{{cite book|last=Wackers|first=Ger|chapter=Chapter 4: |title=Theaters of truth and competence.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does.\n\n=== Continued use ===\nDespite the advantages of positive ventilation systems, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing, and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions,<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /> such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.

In contrast, the Internet application of the protocol may be referred to as '''Exterior Border Gateway Protocol''', '''External BGP''', or '''eBGP'''.\n\nA [[#512k day|Y2K-like overflow]] (512k day) triggered in 2014 for those models that were not appropriately updated.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Border Gateway Protocol has been in use on the Internet since 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://datapath.io/resources/blog/the-history-of-border-gateway-protocol/|title=The History of Border Gateway Protocol|work=blog.datapath.io}}</ref> The current version of BGP is version 4 (BGP4), which was published as RFC 4271 in 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271|title=RFC 4271 - A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)|work=ietf.org}}</ref> after progressing through 20 drafts from documents based on RFC 1771 version 4. RFC 4271 corrected errors, clarified ambiguities and updated the specification with common industry practices. The major enhancement was the support for [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) and use of [[route aggregation]] to decrease the size of [[routing table]]s.\n\n[[IPv6]] BGP was first defined in RFC 1883 in 1995, and it was improved to RFC 2283 in 1998. The new RFC allows BGP4 to carry a wide range of [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] \"address families\". It is also called the Multiprotocol Extensions which is Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP).\n\n== Operation ==\n\nBGP neighbors, called peers, are established by manual configuration among [[Router (computing)|router]]s to create a [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] session on [[port (computer networking)|port]] 179. A BGP speaker sends 19-byte keep-alive messages every 60 seconds<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/ip/routing/bgp/operation/messages/keepalives.shtml|title=BGP Keepalive Messages |work= InetDaemon's IT Tutorials }}</ref> to maintain the connection.<ref>RFC 4274</ref> Among routing protocols, BGP is unique in using TCP as its transport protocol.\n\nWhen BGP runs between two peers in the same [[autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]] (AS), it is referred to as ''Internal BGP'' (''i-BGP'' or ''Interior Border Gateway Protocol''). When it runs between different autonomous systems, it is called ''External BGP'' (''eBGP'' or ''Exterior Border Gateway Protocol''). Routers on the boundary of one AS exchanging information with another AS are called ''border'' or ''edge routers'' or simply ''eBGP peers'' and are typically connected directly, while ''i-BGP peers'' can be interconnected through other intermediate routers. Other deployment [[Network topology|topologies]] are also possible, such as running eBGP peering inside a [[VPN]] tunnel, allowing two remote sites to exchange routing information in a secure and isolated manner. The main difference between iBGP and eBGP peering is in the way routes that were received from one peer are propagated to other peers. For instance, new routes learned from an eBGP peer are typically redistributed to all iBGP peers as well as all other eBGP peers (if ''transit'' mode is enabled on the router). However, if new routes are learned on an iBGP peering, then they are re-advertised only to all eBGP peers. These route-propagation rules effectively require that all iBGP peers inside an AS are interconnected in a full mesh.\n\nHow routes are propagated can be controlled in detail via the ''route-maps'' mechanism. This mechanism consists of a set of rules. Each rule describes, for routes matching some given criteria, what action should be taken. The action could be to drop the route, or it could be to modify some attributes of the route before inserting it in the [[routing table]].\n\n=== Extensions negotiation ===\n[[File:BGP FSM.svg|thumb|BGP state machine]]\n\nDuring the peering handshake, when OPEN messages are exchanged, BGP speakers can negotiate<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2842.txt Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4], RFC 2842, R. Chandra & J. Scudder, May 2000</ref> optional capabilities of the session, including [[Multiprotocol BGP|multiprotocol extensions]] and various recovery modes. If the multiprotocol extensions to BGP<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2858.txt Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4], RFC 2858, T. Bates ''et al.'', June 2000</ref> are negotiated at the time of creation, the BGP speaker can prefix the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) it advertises with an address family prefix. These families include the IPv4 (default), IPv6, IPv4/IPv6 Virtual Private Networks and multicast BGP. Increasingly, BGP is used as a generalized signaling protocol to carry information about routes that may not be part of the global Internet, such as VPNs.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2547.txt BGP/MPLS VPNs.], RFC 2547, E. Rosen and Y. Rekhter, April 2004</ref>\n\nIn order to make decisions in its operations with peers, a BGP peer uses a simple [[finite state machine]] (FSM) that consists of six states: Idle; Connect; Active; OpenSent; OpenConfirm; and Established. For each peer-to-peer session, a BGP implementation maintains a state variable that tracks which of these six states the session is in. The BGP defines the messages that each peer should exchange in order to change the session from one state to another. The first state is the \"Idle\" state. In the \"Idle\" state, BGP initializes all resources, refuses all inbound BGP connection attempts and initiates a TCP connection to the peer. The second state is \"Connect\". In the \"Connect\" state, the router waits for the TCP connection to complete and transitions to the \"OpenSent\" state if successful. If unsuccessful, it starts the ConnectRetry timer and transitions to the \"Active\" state upon expiration. In the \"Active\" state, the router resets the ConnectRetry timer to zero and returns to the \"Connect\" state. In the \"OpenSent\" state, the router sends an Open message and waits for one in return in order to transition to the \"OpenConfirm\" state. Keepalive messages are exchanged and, upon successful receipt, the router is placed into the \"Established\" state. In the \"Established\" state, the router can send/receive: Keepalive; Update; and Notification messages to/from its peer.\n\n* '''Idle State''':\n** Refuse all incoming BGP connections.\n** Start the initialization of event triggers.\n** Initiates a TCP connection with its configured BGP peer.\n** Listens for a TCP connection from its peer.\n** Changes its state to Connect.\n** If an error occurs at any state of the FSM process, the BGP session is terminated immediately and returned to the Idle state. Some of the reasons why a router does not progress from the Idle state are:\n*** TCP port 179 is not open.\n*** A random TCP port over 1023 is not open.\n*** Peer address configured incorrectly on either router.\n*** AS number configured incorrectly on either router.\n* '''Connect State''':\n** Waits for successful TCP negotiation with peer.\n** BGP does not spend much time in this state if the TCP session has been successfully established.\n** Sends Open message to peer and changes state to OpenSent.\n** If an error occurs, BGP moves to the Active state. Some reasons for the error are:\n*** TCP port 179 is not open.\n*** A random TCP port over 1023 is not open.\n*** Peer address configured incorrectly on either router.\n*** AS number configured incorrectly on either router.\n* '''Active State''':\n** If the router was unable to establish a successful TCP session, then it ends up in the Active state.\n** BGP FSM tries to restart another TCP session with the peer and, if successful, then it sends an Open message to the peer.\n** If it is unsuccessful again, the FSM is reset to the Idle state.\n** Repeated failures may result in a router cycling between the Idle and Active states. Some of the reasons for this include:\n*** TCP port 179 is not open.\n*** A random TCP port over 1023 is not open.\n*** BGP configuration error.\n*** Network congestion.\n*** Flapping network interface.\n* '''OpenSent State''':\n** BGP FSM listens for an Open message from its peer.\n** Once the message has been received, the router checks the validity of the Open message.\n** If there is an error it is because one of the fields in the Open message does not match between the peers, e.g., BGP version mismatch, the peering router expects a different My AS, etc. The router then sends a Notification message to the peer indicating why the error occurred.\n** If there is no error, a Keepalive message is sent, various timers are set and the state is changed to OpenConfirm.\n* '''OpenConfirm State''':\n** The peer is listening for a Keepalive message from its peer.\n** If a Keepalive message is received and no timer has expired before reception of the Keepalive, BGP transitions to the Established state.\n** If a timer expires before a Keepalive message is received, or if an error condition occurs, the router transitions back to the Idle state.\n* '''Established State''':\n** In this state, the peers send Update messages to exchange information about each route being advertised to the BGP peer.\n** If there is any error in the Update message then a Notification message is sent to the peer, and BGP transitions back to the Idle state.\n\n=== Router connectivity and learning routes ===\nIn the simplest arrangement, all routers within a single AS and participating in BGP routing must be configured in a full mesh: each router must be configured as peer to every other router. This causes scaling problems, since the number of required connections [[quadratic growth|grows quadratically]] with the number of routers involved. To alleviate the problem, BGP implements two options: [[route reflector]]s (RFC 4456) and [[BGP confederation]]s (RFC 5065). The following discussion of basic UPDATE processing assumes a full iBGP mesh.\n\nA given BGP router may accept Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) UPDATEs from multiple neighbors and advertise NLRI to the same, or a different set, of neighbors. Conceptually, BGP maintains its own \"master\" routing table, called the Local [[Routing Information Base]] (''Loc-RIB''), separate from the main routing table of the router. For each neighbor, the BGP process maintains a conceptual Adjacent Routing Information Base, Incoming (''Adj-RIB-In'') containing the NLRI received from the neighbor, and a conceptual ''Adj-RIB-Out'' (Outgoing) for NLRI to be sent to the neighbor.\n\n\"Conceptual\", in the preceding paragraph, means that the physical storage and structure of these various tables are decided by the implementer of the BGP code. Their structure is not visible to other BGP routers, although they usually can be interrogated with management commands on the local router. It is quite common, for example, to store the two Adj-RIBs and the Loc-RIB together in the same data structure, with additional information attached to the RIB entries. The additional information tells the BGP process such things as whether individual entries belong in the Adj-RIBs for specific neighbors, whether the peer-neighbor route selection process made received policies eligible for the Loc-RIB, and whether Loc-RIB entries are eligible to be submitted to the local router's routing table management process.\n\nBy ''eligible to be submitted'', BGP will submit the routes that it considers best to the main routing table process. Depending on the implementation of that process, the BGP route is not necessarily selected. For example, a directly connected prefix, learned from the router's own hardware, is usually most preferred. As long as that directly connected route's interface is active, the BGP route to the destination will not be put into the routing table. Once the interface goes down, and there are no more preferred routes, the Loc-RIB route would be installed in the main routing table.\nUntil recently, it was a common mistake to say ''BGP carries policies''. BGP actually carried the information with which rules inside BGP-speaking routers could make policy decisions. Some of the information carried that is explicitly intended to be used in policy decisions are communities and multi-exit discriminators (MED).\n\nThe BGP standard specifies a number of decision factors, more than the ones that are used by any other common routing process, for selecting NLRI to go into the Loc-RIB. The first decision point for evaluating NLRI is that its next-hop attribute must be reachable (or resolvable). Another way of saying the next-hop must be reachable is that there must be an active route, already in the main routing table of the router, to the prefix in which the next-hop address is reachable.\n\nNext, for each neighbor, the BGP process applies various standard and implementation-dependent criteria to decide which routes conceptually should go into the Adj-RIB-In. The neighbor could send several possible routes to a destination, but the first level of preference is at the neighbor level. Only one route to each destination will be installed in the conceptual Adj-RIB-In. This process will also delete, from the Adj-RIB-In, any routes that are withdrawn by the neighbor.\n\nWhenever a conceptual Adj-RIB-In changes, the main BGP process decides if any of the neighbor's new routes are preferred to routes already in the Loc-RIB. If so, it replaces them. If a given route is withdrawn by a neighbor, and there is no other route to that destination, the route is removed from the Loc-RIB, and no longer sent, by BGP, to the main routing table manager. If the router does not have a route to that destination from any non-BGP source, the withdrawn route will be removed from the main routing table.\n\nAfter verifying that the next hop is reachable, if the route comes from an internal (i.e. iBGP) peer, the first rule to apply, according to the standard, is to examine the LOCAL_PREFERENCE attribute. If there are several iBGP routes from the neighbor, the one with the highest LOCAL_PREFERENCE is selected unless there are several routes with the same LOCAL_PREFERENCE. In the latter case the route selection process moves to the next tie breaker. While LOCAL_PREFERENCE is the first rule in the standard, once reachability of the NEXT_HOP is verified, Cisco and several other vendors first consider a decision factor called WEIGHT which is local to the router (i.e. not transmitted by BGP). The route with the highest WEIGHT is preferred.\n\nThe LOCAL_PREFERENCE, WEIGHT, and other criteria can be manipulated by local configuration and software capabilities. Such manipulation is outside the scope of the standard but is commonly used. For example, the COMMUNITY attribute (see below) is not directly used by the BGP selection process. The BGP neighbor process however can have a rule to set LOCAL_PREFERENCE or another factor based on a manually programmed rule to set the attribute if the COMMUNITY value matches some pattern matching criterion. If the route was learned from an external peer the per-neighbor BGP process computes a LOCAL_PREFERENCE value from local policy rules and then compares the LOCAL_PREFERENCE of all routes from the neighbor.\n\nAt the per-neighbor level{{snd}} ignoring implementation-specific policy modifiers{{snd}} the order of tie breaking rules is:\n\n# Prefer the route with the shortest AS_PATH. An AS_PATH is the set of AS numbers that must be traversed to reach the advertised destination. AS1-AS2-AS3 is shorter than AS4-AS5-AS6-AS7.\n# Prefer routes with the lowest value of their ORIGIN attribute.\n# Prefer routes with the lowest MULTI_EXIT_DISC (multi-exit discriminator or MED) value.\n''Before the most recent edition of the BGP standard, if an UPDATE had no MULTI_EXIT_DISC value, several implementations created a MED with the highest possible value. The current standard however specifies that missing MEDs are to be treated as the lowest possible value. Since the current rule may cause different behavior than the vendor interpretations, BGP implementations that used the nonstandard default value have a configuration feature that allows the old or standard rule to be selected.''\n\nOnce candidate routes are received from neighbors, the Loc-RIB software applies additional tie-breakers to routes to the same destination.\n\n# If at least one route was learned from an external neighbor (i.e., the route was learned from eBGP), drop all routes learned from iBGP.\n# Prefer the route with the lowest interior cost to the NEXT_HOP, according to the main routing table. If two neighbors advertised the same route, but one neighbor is reachable via a low-bitrate link and the other by a high-bitrate link, and the interior routing protocol calculates lowest cost based on highest bitrate, the route through the high-bitrate link would be preferred and other routes dropped.\n''If there is more than one route still tied at this point, several BGP implementations offer a configurable option to load-share among the routes, accepting all (or all up to some number).''\n# Prefer the route learned from the BGP speaker with the numerically lowest BGP identifier\n# Prefer the route learned from the BGP speaker with the lowest peer IP address\n\n=== Communities ===\n\nBGP communities are attribute tags that can be applied to incoming or outgoing prefixes to achieve some common goal (RFC 1997). While it is common to say that BGP allows an administrator to set policies on how prefixes are handled by ISPs, this is generally not possible, strictly speaking. For instance, BGP natively has no concept to allow one AS to tell another AS to restrict advertisement of a prefix to only North American peering customers. Instead, an ISP generally publishes a list of well-known or proprietary communities with a description for each one, which essentially becomes an agreement of how prefixes are to be treated. RFC 1997 also defines three well-known communities that have global significance; NO_EXPORT, NO_ADVERTISE and NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED. RFC 7611 defines ACCEPT_OWN. Examples of common communities include local preference adjustments, geographic or peer type restrictions, DoS avoidance (black holing), and AS prepending options. An ISP might state that any routes received from customers with community XXX:500 will be advertised to all peers (default) while community XXX:501 will restrict advertisement to North America. The customer simply adjusts their configuration to include the correct community or communities for each route, and the ISP is responsible for controlling who the prefix is advertised to. The end user has no technical ability to enforce correct actions being taken by the ISP, though problems in this area are generally rare and accidental.\n\nIt is a common tactic for end customers to use BGP communities (usually ASN:70,80,90,100) to control the local preference the ISP assigns to advertised routes instead of using MED (the effect is similar). The community attribute is transitive, but communities applied by the customer very rarely become propagated outside the next-hop AS. Not all ISPs give out their communities to the public, while some other do.<ref>{{cite web|title=BGP Community Guides|url=http://www.onesc.net/communities/|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe BGP Extended Community Attribute was added in 2006, in order to extend the range of such attributes and to provide a community attribute structuring by means of a type field. The extended format consists of one or two octets for the type field followed by seven or six octets for the respective community attribute content. The definition of this Extended Community Attribute is documented in RFC 4360. The IANA administers the registry for BGP Extended Communities Types.<ref>[http://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-extended-communities IANA registry for BGP Extended Communities Types], IANA,2008</ref> The Extended Communities Attribute itself is a transitive optional BGP attribute. However, a bit in the type field within the attribute decides whether the encoded extended community is of a transitive or non-transitive nature. The IANA registry therefore provides different number ranges for the attribute types. Due to the extended attribute range, its usage can be manifold. RFC 4360 exemplarly{{typo help inline|reason=similar to exemplarily|date=December 2019}} defines the \"Two-Octet AS Specific Extended Community\", the \"IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community\", the \"Opaque Extended Community\", the \"Route Target Community\", and the \"Route Origin Community\". A number of BGP QoS drafts<ref>[http://www.bgp-qos.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=6 IETF drafts on BGP signalled QoS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223214439/http://www.bgp-qos.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=6 |date=2009-02-23 }}, Thomas Knoll,2008</ref> also use this Extended Community Attribute structure for inter-domain QoS signalling.\n\nNote: since RFC 7153, extended communities are compatible with 32 bits ASNs.\n\nWith the introduction of 32 bits AS numbers, some issues were immediately obvious with the community attribute that only defines a 16 bits ASN field, which prevents the matching between this field and the real ASN value. It is the reason why RFC 8092 and RFC 8195 introduce a [http://largebgpcommunities.net/ Large Community] attribute of 12 bytes, divided in three field of 4 bytes each (AS:function:parameter).\n\n=== Multi-exit discriminators ===\n\nMEDs, defined in the main BGP standard, were originally intended to show to another neighbor AS the advertising AS's preference as to which of several links are preferred for inbound traffic. Another application of MEDs is to advertise the value, typically based on delay, of multiple AS that have presence at an [[IXP]], that they impose to send traffic to some destination.\n\n=== Message header format ===\n\nThe following is the BGP version 4 message header format:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:4%;\"|bit offset\n! colspan=\"16\" style=\"width:50%;\"| 0\u201315\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"width:25%;\"| 16\u201323\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"width:25%;\"| 24\u201331\n|-\n! 0\n| rowspan=\"4\" colspan=\"32\"| Marker\n|-\n! 32\n|-\n! 64\n|-\n! 96\n|-\n! 128\n| colspan=\"16\"| Length\n| colspan=\"8\"| Type\n| colspan=\"8\"|\n|}\n\n* '''Marker''': Included for compatibility, must be set to all ones.\n* '''Length''': Total length of the message in [[Octet (computing)|octets]], including the header.\n* '''Type''': Type of BGP message. The following values are defined:\n** Open (1)\n** Update (2)\n** Notification (3)\n** KeepAlive (4)\n** Route-Refresh (5)\n\n== Problems and mitigation ==\n{{criticism section|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Internal scalability ==\n\nAn autonomous system with internal BGP (iBGP) must have all of its iBGP peers connect to each other in a [[Complete graph|full mesh]] (where everyone speaks to everyone directly). This full-mesh configuration requires that each router maintain a session to every other router. In large networks, this number of sessions may degrade performance of routers, due to either a lack of memory, or high CPU process requirements.\n\n===Route reflectors===\n[[Route reflector]]s<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4456.txt BGP Route Reflection: An Alternative to Full Mesh Internal BGP (iBGP)], RFC 4456, T. Bates ''et al.'', April 2006</ref> reduce the number of connections required in an AS. A single router (or two for redundancy) can be made a route reflector: other routers in the AS need only be configured as peers to them. A route reflector offers an alternative to the logical full-mesh requirement of [[internal border gateway protocol]] (IBGP). A RR acts as a {{clarify span|focal point|date=October 2013}} for IBGP sessions. The purpose of the RR is concentration. Multiple BGP routers can peer with a central point, the RR \u2013 acting as a route reflector server \u2013 rather than peer with every other router in a full mesh. All the other IBGP routers become route reflector clients.\n\nThis approach, similar to [[OSPF]]'s DR/BDR feature, provides large networks with added IBGP scalability. In a fully meshed IBGP network of 10 routers, 90 individual CLI statements (spread throughout all routers in the topology) are needed just to define the remote-AS of each peer: this quickly becomes a headache to administer. A RR topology could cut these 90 statements down to 18, offering a viable solution for the larger networks administered by ISPs.\n\nA route reflector is a [[single point of failure]], therefore at least a second route reflector may be configured in order to provide redundancy. As it is an additional peer for the other 10 routers, it comes with the additional statement count to double that minus 2 of the single Route Reflector setup. An additional 11*2-2=20 statements in this case due to adding the additional Router. Additionally, in a BGP multipath Environment this also can benefit by adding local switching/Routing throughput if the RRs are acting as traditional Routers instead of just a dedicated Route Reflector Server role.\n\n====Rules====\n[[File:RR_BGP.svg|thumbnail|300px|A typical configuration of BGP Route Reflector deployment, as proposed by Section 6, RFC 4456.]]\nRR servers propagate routes inside the AS based on the following rules:\n* If a route is received from a non-client peer, reflect to clients only and EBGP peers.\n* If a route is received from a client peer, reflect to all non-client peers and also to client peers, except the originator of the route and reflect to EBGP peers.\n\n====Cluster====\nRR and its clients form a \"Cluster\". The \"Cluster-ID\" is then attached to every route advertised by RR to its client or nonclient peers. Cluster-ID is a cumulative, non-transitive BGP attribute and every RR MUST prepend the local CLUSTER_ID to the CLUSTER_LIST in order to avoid routing loops.\nRoute reflectors and confederations both reduce the number of iBGP peers to each router and thus reduce processing overhead. Route reflectors are a pure performance-enhancing technique, while confederations also can be used to implement more fine-grained policy.\n\n===BGP confederation===\nConfederations are sets of autonomous systems. In common practice,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5065.txt |title=Info |publisher=www.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref> only one of the confederation AS numbers is seen by the Internet as a whole. Confederations are used in very large networks where a large AS can be configured to encompass smaller more manageable internal ASs.\n\nThe confederated AS is composed of multiple ASs. Each confederated AS alone has iBGP fully meshed and has connections to other ASs inside the confederation. Even though these ASs have eBGP peers to ASs within the confederation, the ASs exchange routing as if they used iBGP. In this way, the confederation preserves next hop, metric, and local preference information. To the outside world, the confederation appears to be a single AS. With this solution, iBGP transit AS problems can be resolved as iBGP requires a full mesh between all BGP routers: large number of TCP sessions and unnecessary duplication of routing traffic.\n\nConfederations can be used in conjunction with route reflectors. Both confederations and route reflectors can be subject to persistent oscillation unless specific design rules, affecting both BGP and the interior routing protocol, are followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3345.txt |title=Info |publisher=www.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref>\n\nHowever, these alternatives can introduce problems of their own, including the following:\n* route oscillation\n* sub-optimal routing\n* increase of BGP convergence time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4098.txt |title=Info |publisher=www.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, route reflectors and BGP confederations were not designed to ease BGP router configuration. Nevertheless, these are common tools for experienced BGP network architects. These tools may be combined, for example, as a hierarchy of route reflectors.\n\n== Stability ==\n\nThe routing tables managed by a BGP implementation are adjusted continually to reflect actual changes in the network, such as links breaking and being restored or routers going down and coming back up. In the network as a whole it is normal for these changes to happen almost continuously, but for any particular router or link, changes are supposed to be relatively infrequent. If a router is misconfigured or mismanaged then it may get into a rapid cycle between down and up states. This pattern of repeated withdrawal and re-announcement known as [[route flapping]] can cause excessive activity in all the other routers that know about the broken link, as the same route is continually injected and withdrawn from the routing tables. The BGP design is such that delivery of traffic may not function while routes are being updated. On the Internet, a BGP routing change may cause outages for several minutes.\n\nA feature known as ''route flap damping'' ([http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2439.txt RFC 2439]) is built into many BGP implementations in an attempt to mitigate the effects of route flapping. Without damping, the excessive activity can cause a heavy processing load on routers, which may in turn delay updates on other routes, and so affect overall routing stability. With damping, a route's flapping is [[exponential decay|exponentially decayed]]. At the first instance when a route becomes unavailable and quickly reappears, damping does not take effect, so as to maintain the normal fail-over times of BGP. At the second occurrence, BGP shuns that prefix for a certain length of time; subsequent occurrences are timed out exponentially. After the abnormalities have ceased and a suitable length of time has passed for the offending route, prefixes can be reinstated and its slate wiped clean. Damping can also mitigate [[denial of service]] attacks; damping timings are highly customizable.\n\nIt is also suggested in RFC 2439 (under \"Design Choices -> Stability Sensitive Suppression of Route Advertisement\") that route flap damping is a feature more desirable if implemented to Exterior Border Gateway Protocol Sessions (eBGP sessions or simply called exterior peers) and not on Interior Border Gateway Protocol Sessions (iBGP sessions or simply called internal peers); With this approach when a route flaps inside an autonomous system, it is not propagated to the external ASs{{snd}} flapping a route to an eBGP will have a chain of flapping for the particular route throughout the backbone. This method also successfully avoids the overhead of route flap damping for iBGP sessions.\n\nHowever, subsequent research has shown that flap damping can actually lengthen convergence times in some cases, and can cause interruptions in connectivity even when links are not flapping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/Papers/sig02.pdf|format=PDF|title=Route Flap Damping Exacerbates Internet Routing Convergence|date=November 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~bzhang/paper/05-icdcs-dtimer.pdf | last = Zhang | first = Beichuan | title = Timer Interaction in Route Flap Damping | accessdate = 2006-09-26 |author2=Pei Dan |author3=Daniel Massey |author4=[[Lixia Zhang]] |date=June 2005 | work = IEEE 25th [[International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems]] | quote = We show that the current damping design leads to the intended behavior only under persistent route flapping.

If the global routing table grows to the point where some older, less capable routers cannot cope with the memory requirements or the CPU load of maintaining the table, these routers will cease to be effective gateways between the parts of the Internet they connect. In addition, and perhaps even more importantly, larger routing tables take longer to stabilize (see above) after a major connectivity change, leaving network service unreliable, or even unavailable, in the interim.\n\nUntil late 2001, the global routing table was [[exponential growth|growing exponentially]], threatening an eventual widespread breakdown of connectivity. In an attempt to prevent this, ISPs cooperated in keeping the global routing table as small as possible, by using [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) and [[route aggregation]]. While this slowed the growth of the routing table to a linear process for several years, with the expanded demand for [[multihoming]] by end user networks the growth was once again superlinear by the middle of 2004.\n\n===512k day===\nWhile a full IPv4 BGP table {{as of|August 2014|lc=on}} (512k day)<ref>as of the 12th of August 2014, multiple [[Router_(computing)|Internet routers]], manufactured by [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] and other vendors, encountered a default software limit of 512K (512,000 - 524,288) {{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/117712-problemsolution-cat6500-00.html#.U-okMKwClYO.twitter  |title=Cisco switch problem}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renesys.com/2014/08/internet-512k-global-routes   |title=Renesys 512k global routes}}</ref> is in excess of 512,000 prefixes,<ref name=\"Potaroo&nbsp;\u2014 BGP Table data\">{{cite web|url=http://bgp.potaroo.net/index-bgp.html|title=BGP Reports|work=potaroo.net}}</ref> many older routers have a limit of 512k (512,000\u2013524,288)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/117712-problemsolution-cat6500-00.html#.U-okMKwClYO.twitter|title=CAT 6500 and 7600 Series Routers and Switches TCAM Allocation Adjustment Procedures|date=9 March 2015|work=Cisco}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renesys.com/2014/08/internet-512k-global-routes/|title=Internet Touches Half Million Routes: Outages Possible Next Week|author=Jim Cowie|work=Dyn Research}}</ref> routing table entries.

On impacted routers, the TCAM is default allocated to 512k entries for IPv4 routes, and 512k entries for IPv6 routes. While the reported number of IPv6 advertised routes was only about 20k, the number of advertised IPv4 routes reached the default limit, causing a [[spillover effect]] as routers attempted to compensate for the issue by using slow software routing (as opposed to fast hardware routing via TCAM). The main method for dealing with this issue involves operators changing the TCAM allocation to allow more IPv4 entries, by reallocating some of the TCAM reserved for IPv6 routes. This requires a reboot on most routers. The 512k problem was predicted in advance by a number of IT professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog39/presentations/bof-report.pdf |title=BOF report |publisher=www.nanog.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://etherealmind.com/tcam-detail-review/|title=TCAM&nbsp;\u2014 a Deeper Look and the impact of IPv6|author=Greg Ferro|work=EtherealMind}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipv4depletion.com/?p=672|title=The IPv4 Depletion site|work=ipv4depletion.com}}</ref>\n\nThe actual allocations which pushed the number of routes above 512k was the announcement of about 15,000 new routes in short order, starting at 07:48 UTC. Almost all of these routes were to [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] [[Autonomous System (Internet)|Autonomous Systems]] 701 and 705, created as a result of [[route aggregation|deaggregation]] of larger blocks, introducing thousands of new [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|{{IPaddr||24}} routes]], and making the routing table reach 515,000 entries. The new routes appear to have been reaggregated within 5 minutes, but instability across the Internet apparently continued for a number of hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bgpmon.net/what-caused-todays-internet-hiccup/|title=What caused today\u2019s Internet hiccup|work=bgpmon.net}}</ref> Even if Verizon had not caused the routing table to exceed 512k entries in the short spike, it would have happened soon anyway through natural growth.\n\nRoute summarization is often used to improve aggregation of the BGP global routing table, thereby reducing the necessary table size in routers of an AS. Consider AS1 has been allocated the big address space of {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}, this would be counted as one route in the table, but due to customer requirement or traffic engineering purposes, AS1 wants to announce smaller, more specific routes of {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|18}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}}, and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}. The prefix {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}} does not have any hosts so AS1 does not announce a specific route {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}}. This all counts as AS1 announcing four routes.\n\nAS2 will see the four routes from AS1 ({{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|18}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}}, and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}) and it is up to the routing policy of AS2 to decide whether or not to take a copy of the four routes or, as {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}} overlaps all the other specific routes, to just store the summary, {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}.\n\nIf AS2 wants to send data to prefix {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}}, it will be sent to the routers of AS1 on route {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0/16}}. At AS1's router, it will either be dropped or a destination unreachable [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] message will be sent back, depending on the configuration of AS1's routers.\n\nIf AS1 later decides to drop the route {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}, leaving {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|18}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}}, and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}, AS1 will drop the number of routes it announces to three. AS2 will see the three routes, and depending on the routing policy of AS2, it will store a copy of the three routes, or aggregate the prefix's {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0/18}} and {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}} to {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|17}}, thereby reducing the number of routes AS2 stores to only two: {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|17}} and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}.\n\nIf AS2 wants to send data to prefix {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}}, it will be dropped or a destination unreachable ICMP message will be sent back at the routers of AS2 (not AS1 as before), because {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}} would not be in the routing table.\n\n=== AS numbers depletion and 32 bits ASN ===\n\nThe RFC 1771 (''A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)'') planned the coding of AS numbers on 16 bits, for 64510 possible public AS, since ASN 64512 to 65534 were reserved for private use (0 and 65535 being forbidden). In 2011, only 15000 AS numbers were still available, and projections<ref>[http://www.potaroo.net/tools/asn16/ ''16-bit Autonomus System Report''], Geoff Huston 2011 (original archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20110906085724/http://www.potaroo.net/tools/asn16/)</ref> were envisioning a complete depletion of available AS numbers in September 2013.\n\nRFC 6793 extends AS coding from 16 to 32 bits (keeping the 16 bits AS range 0 to 65535, and its reserved AS numbers), which now allows up to 4 billion available AS. An additional private AS range is also defined in RFC 6996 (from 4200000000 to 4294967294, 4294967295 being forbidden by RFC 7300).\n\nTo allow the traversal of router groups not able to manage those new ASNs, the new attribute OT AS4_PATH is used.\n\n32 bits ASN assignments started in 2007.\n\n== Load balancing ==\n\nAnother factor causing this growth of the routing table is the need for load balancing of multi-homed networks. It is not a trivial task to balance the inbound traffic to a multi-homed network across its multiple inbound paths, due to limitation of the BGP route selection process. For a multi-homed network, if it announces the same network blocks across all of its BGP peers, the result may be that one or several of its inbound links become congested while the other links remain under-utilized, because external networks all picked that set of congested paths as optimal. Like most other routing protocols, BGP does not detect congestion.\n\nTo work around this problem, BGP administrators of that multihomed network may divide a large contiguous IP address block into smaller blocks and tweak the route announcement to make different blocks look optimal on different paths, so that external networks will choose a different path to reach different blocks of that multi-homed network. Such cases will increase the number of routes as seen on the global BGP table.\n\nOne method growing in popularity to address the load balancing issue is to deploy BGP/LISP ([[Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol]]) gateways within an [[Internet exchange point]] to allow ingress traffic engineering across multiple links. This technique does not increase the number of routes seen on the global BGP table.\n\n== Security ==\n\nBy design, routers running BGP accept advertised routes from other BGP routers by default. This allows for automatic and decentralized routing of traffic across the Internet, but it also leaves the Internet potentially vulnerable to accidental or malicious disruption, known as [[BGP hijacking]]. Due to the extent to which BGP is embedded in the core systems of the Internet, and the number of different networks operated by many different organizations which collectively make up the Internet, correcting this vulnerability (such as by introducing the use of cryptographic keys to verify the identity of BGP routers) is a technically and economically challenging problem.<ref>{{cite news|author=Craig Timberg |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/31/net-of-insecurity-part-2/|title=Quick fix for an early Internet problem lives on a quarter-century later|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2015-05-31 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}</ref>\n\n== Extensions ==\n\nAn extension to BGP is the use of multipathing{{snd}} this typically requires identical MED, weight, origin, and AS-path although some implementations provide the ability to relax the AS-path checking to only expect an equal path length rather than the actual AS numbers in the path being expected to match too. This can then be extended further with features like Cisco's dmzlink-bw which enables a ratio of traffic sharing based on bandwidth values configured on individual links.\n\nMultiprotocol Extensions for BGP (MBGP), sometimes referred to as Multiprotocol BGP or Multicast BGP and defined in IETF <nowiki>RFC 4760</nowiki>, is an extension to (BGP) that allows different types of addresses (known as address families) to be distributed in parallel. Whereas standard BGP supports only IPv4 unicast addresses, Multiprotocol BGP supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and it supports unicast and multicast variants of each. Multiprotocol BGP allows information about the topology of IP multicast-capable routers to be exchanged separately from the topology of normal IPv4 unicast routers. Thus, it allows a multicast routing topology different from the unicast routing topology. Although MBGP enables the exchange of inter-domain multicast routing information, other protocols such as the Protocol Independent Multicast family are needed to build trees and forward multicast traffic.\n\nMultiprotocol BGP is also widely deployed in case of MPLS L3 VPN, to exchange VPN labels learned for the routes from the customer sites over the MPLS network, in order to distinguish between different customer sites when the traffic from the other customer sites comes to the Provider Edge router (PE router) for routing.\n\n== Uses ==\n\nBGP4 is standard for Internet routing and required of most [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) to establish routing between one another. Very large private [[Internet Protocol|IP]] networks use BGP internally. An example is the joining of a number of large [[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF) networks, when OSPF by itself does not scale to the size required. Another reason to use BGP is multihoming a network for better redundancy, either to multiple access points of a single ISP or to multiple ISPs.\n\n== Implementations ==\n\nRouters, especially small ones intended for [[Small office/home office|Small Office/Home Office]] (SOHO) use, may not include BGP software. Some SOHO routers simply are not capable of running BGP / using BGP routing tables of any size. Other commercial routers may need a specific software executable image that contains BGP, or a license that enables it. Open source packages that run BGP include [[GNU Zebra]], [[Quagga (software)|Quagga]], [[OpenBGPD]], [[Bird Internet routing daemon|BIRD]], [[XORP]], and [[Vyatta]]. Devices marketed as [[Layer 3 switch]]es are less likely to support BGP than devices marketed as [[Router (computing)|routers]], but high-end Layer 3 Switches usually can run BGP.\n\nProducts marketed as switches may or may not have a size limitation on BGP tables, such as 20,000 routes, far smaller than a full Internet table plus internal routes. These devices, however, may be perfectly reasonable and useful when used for BGP routing of some smaller part of the network, such as a [[confederation-AS]] representing one of several smaller enterprises that are linked, by a BGP [[backbone of backbones]], or a small enterprise that announces routes to an ISP but only accepts a [[default route]] and perhaps a small number of aggregated routes.\n\nA BGP router used only for a network with a single point of entry to the Internet may have a much smaller routing table size (and hence RAM and CPU requirement) than a multihomed network. Even simple multihoming can have modest routing table size. See RFC 4098 for vendor-independent performance parameters for single BGP router convergence in the control plane. The actual amount of memory required in a BGP router depends on the amount of BGP information exchanged with other BGP speakers and the way in which the particular router stores BGP information. The router may have to keep more than one copy of a route, so it can manage different policies for route advertising and acceptance to a specific neighboring AS. The term view is often used for these different policy relationships on a running router.\n\nIf one router implementation takes more memory per route than another implementation, this may be a legitimate design choice, trading processing speed against memory. A full IPv4 BGP table {{as of|August 2015|lc=on}} is in excess of 590,000 prefixes.<ref name=\"Potaroo&nbsp;\u2014 BGP Table data\"/> Large ISPs may add another 50% for internal and customer routes. Again depending on implementation, separate tables may be kept for each view of a different peer AS.\n\nNotable free and open source implementations of BGP include:\n\n* [[Bird Internet routing daemon|BIRD Internet Routing Daemon]], a GPL routing package for Unix-like systems.\n*[[FRRouting]], a fork of Quagga for [[Unix-like]] systems.\n* [[GNU Zebra]], a [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] routing suite supporting BGP4.

makes [[routing]] decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a [[network administrator]] and is involved in making core [[routing]] decisions.\n\nBGP may be used for routing within an autonomous system. In this application it is referred to as '''Interior Border Gateway Protocol''', '''Internal BGP''', or '''iBGP'''. In contrast, the Internet application of the protocol may be referred to as '''Exterior Border Gateway Protocol''', '''External BGP''', or '''eBGP'''.\n\nA [[#512k day|Y2K-like overflow]] (512k day) triggered in 2014 for those models that were not appropriately updated.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Border Gateway Protocol has been in use on the Internet since 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://datapath.io/resources/blog/the-history-of-border-gateway-protocol/|title=The History of Border Gateway Protocol|work=blog.datapath.io}}</ref> The current version of BGP is version 4 (BGP4), which was published as RFC 4271 in 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271|title=RFC 4271 - A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)|work=ietf.org}}</ref> after progressing through 20 drafts from documents based on RFC 1771 version 4. RFC 4271 corrected errors, clarified ambiguities and updated the specification with common industry practices. The major enhancement was the support for [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) and use of [[route aggregation]] to decrease the size of [[routing table]]s.\n\n[[IPv6]] BGP was first defined in RFC 1883 in 1995, and it was improved to RFC 2283 in 1998. The new RFC allows BGP4 to carry a wide range of [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] \"address families\". It is also called the Multiprotocol Extensions which is Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP).\n\n== Operation ==\n\nBGP neighbors, called peers, are established by manual configuration among [[Router (computing)|router]]s to create a [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] session on [[port (computer networking)|port]] 179. A BGP speaker sends 19-byte keep-alive messages every 60 seconds<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/ip/routing/bgp/operation/messages/keepalives.shtml|title=BGP Keepalive Messages |work= InetDaemon's IT Tutorials }}</ref> to maintain the connection.<ref>RFC 4274</ref> Among routing protocols, BGP is unique in using TCP as its transport protocol.\n\nWhen BGP runs between two peers in the same [[autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]] (AS), it is referred to as ''Internal BGP'' (''i-BGP'' or ''Interior Border Gateway Protocol''). When it runs between different autonomous systems, it is called ''External BGP'' (''eBGP'' or ''Exterior Border Gateway Protocol''). Routers on the boundary of one AS exchanging information with another AS are called ''border'' or ''edge routers'' or simply ''eBGP peers'' and are typically connected directly, while ''i-BGP peers'' can be interconnected through other intermediate routers. Other deployment [[Network topology|topologies]] are also possible, such as running eBGP peering inside a [[VPN]] tunnel, allowing two remote sites to exchange routing information in a secure and isolated manner. The main difference between iBGP and eBGP peering is in the way routes that were received from one peer are propagated to other peers. For instance, new routes learned from an eBGP peer are typically redistributed to all iBGP peers as well as all other eBGP peers (if ''transit'' mode is enabled on the router). However, if new routes are learned on an iBGP peering, then they are re-advertised only to all eBGP peers. These route-propagation rules effectively require that all iBGP peers inside an AS are interconnected in a full mesh.\n\nHow routes are propagated can be controlled in detail via the ''route-maps'' mechanism. This mechanism consists of a set of rules. Each rule describes, for routes matching some given criteria, what action should be taken. The action could be to drop the route, or it could be to modify some attributes of the route before inserting it in the [[routing table]].\n\n=== Extensions negotiation ===\n[[File:BGP FSM.svg|thumb|BGP state machine]]\n\nDuring the peering handshake, when OPEN messages are exchanged, BGP speakers can negotiate<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2842.txt Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4], RFC 2842, R. Chandra & J. Scudder, May 2000</ref> optional capabilities of the session, including [[Multiprotocol BGP|multiprotocol extensions]] and various recovery modes. If the multiprotocol extensions to BGP<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2858.txt Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4], RFC 2858, T. Bates ''et al.'', June 2000</ref> are negotiated at the time of creation, the BGP speaker can prefix the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) it advertises with an address family prefix. These families include the IPv4 (default), IPv6, IPv4/IPv6 Virtual Private Networks and multicast BGP. Increasingly, BGP is used as a generalized signaling protocol to carry information about routes that may not be part of the global Internet, such as VPNs.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2547.txt BGP/MPLS VPNs.], RFC 2547, E. Rosen and Y. Rekhter, April 2004</ref>\n\nIn order to make decisions in its operations with peers, a BGP peer uses a simple [[finite state machine]] (FSM) that consists of six states: Idle; Connect; Active; OpenSent; OpenConfirm; and Established. For each peer-to-peer session, a BGP implementation maintains a state variable that tracks which of these six states the session is in. The BGP defines the messages that each peer should exchange in order to change the session from one state to another. The first state is the \"Idle\" state. In the \"Idle\" state, BGP initializes all resources, refuses all inbound BGP connection attempts and initiates a TCP connection to the peer. The second state is \"Connect\". In the \"Connect\" state, the router waits for the TCP connection to complete and transitions to the \"OpenSent\" state if successful. If unsuccessful, it starts the ConnectRetry timer and transitions to the \"Active\" state upon expiration. In the \"Active\" state, the router resets the ConnectRetry timer to zero and returns to the \"Connect\" state. In the \"OpenSent\" state, the router sends an Open message and waits for one in return in order to transition to the \"OpenConfirm\" state. Keepalive messages are exchanged and, upon successful receipt, the router is placed into the \"Established\" state. In the \"Established\" state, the router can send/receive: Keepalive; Update; and Notification messages to/from its peer.\n\n* '''Idle State''':\n** Refuse all incoming BGP connections.\n** Start the initialization of event triggers.\n** Initiates a TCP connection with its configured BGP peer.\n** Listens for a TCP connection from its peer.\n** Changes its state to Connect.\n** If an error occurs at any state of the FSM process, the BGP session is terminated immediately and returned to the Idle state. Some of the reasons why a router does not progress from the Idle state are:\n*** TCP port 179 is not open.\n*** A random TCP port over 1023 is not open.\n*** Peer address configured incorrectly on either router.\n*** AS number configured incorrectly on either router.\n* '''Connect State''':\n** Waits for successful TCP negotiation with peer.\n** BGP does not spend much time in this state if the TCP session has been successfully established.\n** Sends Open message to peer and changes state to OpenSent.\n** If an error occurs, BGP moves to the Active state. Some reasons for the error are:\n*** TCP port 179 is not open.\n*** A random TCP port over 1023 is not open.\n*** Peer address configured incorrectly on either router.\n*** AS number configured incorrectly on either router.\n* '''Active State''':\n** If the router was unable to establish a successful TCP session, then it ends up in the Active state.\n** BGP FSM tries to restart another TCP session with the peer and, if successful, then it sends an Open message to the peer.\n** If it is unsuccessful again, the FSM is reset to the Idle state.\n** Repeated failures may result in a router cycling between the Idle and Active states. Some of the reasons for this include:\n*** TCP port 179 is not open.\n*** A random TCP port over 1023 is not open.\n*** BGP configuration error.\n*** Network congestion.\n*** Flapping network interface.\n* '''OpenSent State''':\n** BGP FSM listens for an Open message from its peer.\n** Once the message has been received, the router checks the validity of the Open message.\n** If there is an error it is because one of the fields in the Open message does not match between the peers, e.g., BGP version mismatch, the peering router expects a different My AS, etc. The router then sends a Notification message to the peer indicating why the error occurred.\n** If there is no error, a Keepalive message is sent, various timers are set and the state is changed to OpenConfirm.\n* '''OpenConfirm State''':\n** The peer is listening for a Keepalive message from its peer.\n** If a Keepalive message is received and no timer has expired before reception of the Keepalive, BGP transitions to the Established state.\n** If a timer expires before a Keepalive message is received, or if an error condition occurs, the router transitions back to the Idle state.\n* '''Established State''':\n** In this state, the peers send Update messages to exchange information about each route being advertised to the BGP peer.\n** If there is any error in the Update message then a Notification message is sent to the peer, and BGP transitions back to the Idle state.\n\n=== Router connectivity and learning routes ===\nIn the simplest arrangement, all routers within a single AS and participating in BGP routing must be configured in a full mesh: each router must be configured as peer to every other router. This causes scaling problems, since the number of required connections [[quadratic growth|grows quadratically]] with the number of routers involved. To alleviate the problem, BGP implements two options: [[route reflector]]s (RFC 4456) and [[BGP confederation]]s (RFC 5065). The following discussion of basic UPDATE processing assumes a full iBGP mesh.\n\nA given BGP router may accept Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) UPDATEs from multiple neighbors and advertise NLRI to the same, or a different set, of neighbors. Conceptually, BGP maintains its own \"master\" routing table, called the Local [[Routing Information Base]] (''Loc-RIB''), separate from the main routing table of the router. For each neighbor, the BGP process maintains a conceptual Adjacent Routing Information Base, Incoming (''Adj-RIB-In'') containing the NLRI received from the neighbor, and a conceptual ''Adj-RIB-Out'' (Outgoing) for NLRI to be sent to the neighbor.\n\n\"Conceptual\", in the preceding paragraph, means that the physical storage and structure of these various tables are decided by the implementer of the BGP code. Their structure is not visible to other BGP routers, although they usually can be interrogated with management commands on the local router. It is quite common, for example, to store the two Adj-RIBs and the Loc-RIB together in the same data structure, with additional information attached to the RIB entries. The additional information tells the BGP process such things as whether individual entries belong in the Adj-RIBs for specific neighbors, whether the peer-neighbor route selection process made received policies eligible for the Loc-RIB, and whether Loc-RIB entries are eligible to be submitted to the local router's routing table management process.\n\nBy ''eligible to be submitted'', BGP will submit the routes that it considers best to the main routing table process. Depending on the implementation of that process, the BGP route is not necessarily selected. For example, a directly connected prefix, learned from the router's own hardware, is usually most preferred. As long as that directly connected route's interface is active, the BGP route to the destination will not be put into the routing table. Once the interface goes down, and there are no more preferred routes, the Loc-RIB route would be installed in the main routing table.\nUntil recently, it was a common mistake to say ''BGP carries policies''. BGP actually carried the information with which rules inside BGP-speaking routers could make policy decisions. Some of the information carried that is explicitly intended to be used in policy decisions are communities and multi-exit discriminators (MED).\n\nThe BGP standard specifies a number of decision factors, more than the ones that are used by any other common routing process, for selecting NLRI to go into the Loc-RIB. The first decision point for evaluating NLRI is that its next-hop attribute must be reachable (or resolvable). Another way of saying the next-hop must be reachable is that there must be an active route, already in the main routing table of the router, to the prefix in which the next-hop address is reachable.\n\nNext, for each neighbor, the BGP process applies various standard and implementation-dependent criteria to decide which routes conceptually should go into the Adj-RIB-In. The neighbor could send several possible routes to a destination, but the first level of preference is at the neighbor level. Only one route to each destination will be installed in the conceptual Adj-RIB-In. This process will also delete, from the Adj-RIB-In, any routes that are withdrawn by the neighbor.\n\nWhenever a conceptual Adj-RIB-In changes, the main BGP process decides if any of the neighbor's new routes are preferred to routes already in the Loc-RIB. If so, it replaces them. If a given route is withdrawn by a neighbor, and there is no other route to that destination, the route is removed from the Loc-RIB, and no longer sent, by BGP, to the main routing table manager. If the router does not have a route to that destination from any non-BGP source, the withdrawn route will be removed from the main routing table.\n\nAfter verifying that the next hop is reachable, if the route comes from an internal (i.e. iBGP) peer, the first rule to apply, according to the standard, is to examine the LOCAL_PREFERENCE attribute. If there are several iBGP routes from the neighbor, the one with the highest LOCAL_PREFERENCE is selected unless there are several routes with the same LOCAL_PREFERENCE. In the latter case the route selection process moves to the next tie breaker. While LOCAL_PREFERENCE is the first rule in the standard, once reachability of the NEXT_HOP is verified, Cisco and several other vendors first consider a decision factor called WEIGHT which is local to the router (i.e. not transmitted by BGP). The route with the highest WEIGHT is preferred.\n\nThe LOCAL_PREFERENCE, WEIGHT, and other criteria can be manipulated by local configuration and software capabilities. Such manipulation is outside the scope of the standard but is commonly used. For example, the COMMUNITY attribute (see below) is not directly used by the BGP selection process. The BGP neighbor process however can have a rule to set LOCAL_PREFERENCE or another factor based on a manually programmed rule to set the attribute if the COMMUNITY value matches some pattern matching criterion. If the route was learned from an external peer the per-neighbor BGP process computes a LOCAL_PREFERENCE value from local policy rules and then compares the LOCAL_PREFERENCE of all routes from the neighbor.\n\nAt the per-neighbor level{{snd}} ignoring implementation-specific policy modifiers{{snd}} the order of tie breaking rules is:\n\n# Prefer the route with the shortest AS_PATH. An AS_PATH is the set of AS numbers that must be traversed to reach the advertised destination. AS1-AS2-AS3 is shorter than AS4-AS5-AS6-AS7.\n# Prefer routes with the lowest value of their ORIGIN attribute.\n# Prefer routes with the lowest MULTI_EXIT_DISC (multi-exit discriminator or MED) value.\n''Before the most recent edition of the BGP standard, if an UPDATE had no MULTI_EXIT_DISC value, several implementations created a MED with the highest possible value. The current standard however specifies that missing MEDs are to be treated as the lowest possible value. Since the current rule may cause different behavior than the vendor interpretations, BGP implementations that used the nonstandard default value have a configuration feature that allows the old or standard rule to be selected.''\n\nOnce candidate routes are received from neighbors, the Loc-RIB software applies additional tie-breakers to routes to the same destination.\n\n# If at least one route was learned from an external neighbor (i.e., the route was learned from eBGP), drop all routes learned from iBGP.\n# Prefer the route with the lowest interior cost to the NEXT_HOP, according to the main routing table. If two neighbors advertised the same route, but one neighbor is reachable via a low-bitrate link and the other by a high-bitrate link, and the interior routing protocol calculates lowest cost based on highest bitrate, the route through the high-bitrate link would be preferred and other routes dropped.\n''If there is more than one route still tied at this point, several BGP implementations offer a configurable option to load-share among the routes, accepting all (or all up to some number).''\n# Prefer the route learned from the BGP speaker with the numerically lowest BGP identifier\n# Prefer the route learned from the BGP speaker with the lowest peer IP address\n\n=== Communities ===\n\nBGP communities are attribute tags that can be applied to incoming or outgoing prefixes to achieve some common goal (RFC 1997). While it is common to say that BGP allows an administrator to set policies on how prefixes are handled by ISPs, this is generally not possible, strictly speaking. For instance, BGP natively has no concept to allow one AS to tell another AS to restrict advertisement of a prefix to only North American peering customers. Instead, an ISP generally publishes a list of well-known or proprietary communities with a description for each one, which essentially becomes an agreement of how prefixes are to be treated. RFC 1997 also defines three well-known communities that have global significance; NO_EXPORT, NO_ADVERTISE and NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED. RFC 7611 defines ACCEPT_OWN. Examples of common communities include local preference adjustments, geographic or peer type restrictions, DoS avoidance (black holing), and AS prepending options. An ISP might state that any routes received from customers with community XXX:500 will be advertised to all peers (default) while community XXX:501 will restrict advertisement to North America. The customer simply adjusts their configuration to include the correct community or communities for each route, and the ISP is responsible for controlling who the prefix is advertised to. The end user has no technical ability to enforce correct actions being taken by the ISP, though problems in this area are generally rare and accidental.\n\nIt is a common tactic for end customers to use BGP communities (usually ASN:70,80,90,100) to control the local preference the ISP assigns to advertised routes instead of using MED (the effect is similar). The community attribute is transitive, but communities applied by the customer very rarely become propagated outside the next-hop AS. Not all ISPs give out their communities to the public, while some other do.<ref>{{cite web|title=BGP Community Guides|url=http://www.onesc.net/communities/|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe BGP Extended Community Attribute was added in 2006, in order to extend the range of such attributes and to provide a community attribute structuring by means of a type field. The extended format consists of one or two octets for the type field followed by seven or six octets for the respective community attribute content. The definition of this Extended Community Attribute is documented in RFC 4360. The IANA administers the registry for BGP Extended Communities Types.<ref>[http://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-extended-communities IANA registry for BGP Extended Communities Types], IANA,2008</ref> The Extended Communities Attribute itself is a transitive optional BGP attribute. However, a bit in the type field within the attribute decides whether the encoded extended community is of a transitive or non-transitive nature. The IANA registry therefore provides different number ranges for the attribute types. Due to the extended attribute range, its usage can be manifold. RFC 4360 exemplarly{{typo help inline|reason=similar to exemplarily|date=December 2019}} defines the \"Two-Octet AS Specific Extended Community\", the \"IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community\", the \"Opaque Extended Community\", the \"Route Target Community\", and the \"Route Origin Community\". A number of BGP QoS drafts<ref>[http://www.bgp-qos.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=6 IETF drafts on BGP signalled QoS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223214439/http://www.bgp-qos.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=6 |date=2009-02-23 }}, Thomas Knoll,2008</ref> also use this Extended Community Attribute structure for inter-domain QoS signalling.\n\nNote: since RFC 7153, extended communities are compatible with 32 bits ASNs.\n\nWith the introduction of 32 bits AS numbers, some issues were immediately obvious with the community attribute that only defines a 16 bits ASN field, which prevents the matching between this field and the real ASN value. It is the reason why RFC 8092 and RFC 8195 introduce a [http://largebgpcommunities.net/ Large Community] attribute of 12 bytes, divided in three field of 4 bytes each (AS:function:parameter).\n\n=== Multi-exit discriminators ===\n\nMEDs, defined in the main BGP standard, were originally intended to show to another neighbor AS the advertising AS's preference as to which of several links are preferred for inbound traffic. Another application of MEDs is to advertise the value, typically based on delay, of multiple AS that have presence at an [[IXP]], that they impose to send traffic to some destination.\n\n=== Message header format ===\n\nThe following is the BGP version 4 message header format:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:4%;\"|bit offset\n! colspan=\"16\" style=\"width:50%;\"| 0\u201315\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"width:25%;\"| 16\u201323\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"width:25%;\"| 24\u201331\n|-\n! 0\n| rowspan=\"4\" colspan=\"32\"| Marker\n|-\n! 32\n|-\n! 64\n|-\n! 96\n|-\n! 128\n| colspan=\"16\"| Length\n| colspan=\"8\"| Type\n| colspan=\"8\"|\n|}\n\n* '''Marker''': Included for compatibility, must be set to all ones.\n* '''Length''': Total length of the message in [[Octet (computing)|octets]], including the header.\n* '''Type''': Type of BGP message. The following values are defined:\n** Open (1)\n** Update (2)\n** Notification (3)\n** KeepAlive (4)\n** Route-Refresh (5)\n\n== Problems and mitigation ==\n{{criticism section|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Internal scalability ==\n\nAn autonomous system with internal BGP (iBGP) must have all of its iBGP peers connect to each other in a [[Complete graph|full mesh]] (where everyone speaks to everyone directly). This full-mesh configuration requires that each router maintain a session to every other router. In large networks, this number of sessions may degrade performance of routers, due to either a lack of memory, or high CPU process requirements.\n\n===Route reflectors===\n[[Route reflector]]s<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4456.txt BGP Route Reflection: An Alternative to Full Mesh Internal BGP (iBGP)], RFC 4456, T. Bates ''et al.'', April 2006</ref> reduce the number of connections required in an AS. A single router (or two for redundancy) can be made a route reflector: other routers in the AS need only be configured as peers to them. A route reflector offers an alternative to the logical full-mesh requirement of [[internal border gateway protocol]] (IBGP). A RR acts as a {{clarify span|focal point|date=October 2013}} for IBGP sessions. The purpose of the RR is concentration. Multiple BGP routers can peer with a central point, the RR \u2013 acting as a route reflector server \u2013 rather than peer with every other router in a full mesh. All the other IBGP routers become route reflector clients.\n\nThis approach, similar to [[OSPF]]'s DR/BDR feature, provides large networks with added IBGP scalability. In a fully meshed IBGP network of 10 routers, 90 individual CLI statements (spread throughout all routers in the topology) are needed just to define the remote-AS of each peer: this quickly becomes a headache to administer. A RR topology could cut these 90 statements down to 18, offering a viable solution for the larger networks administered by ISPs.\n\nA route reflector is a [[single point of failure]], therefore at least a second route reflector may be configured in order to provide redundancy. As it is an additional peer for the other 10 routers, it comes with the additional statement count to double that minus 2 of the single Route Reflector setup. An additional 11*2-2=20 statements in this case due to adding the additional Router. Additionally, in a BGP multipath Environment this also can benefit by adding local switching/Routing throughput if the RRs are acting as traditional Routers instead of just a dedicated Route Reflector Server role.\n\n====Rules====\n[[File:RR_BGP.svg|thumbnail|300px|A typical configuration of BGP Route Reflector deployment, as proposed by Section 6, RFC 4456.]]\nRR servers propagate routes inside the AS based on the following rules:\n* If a route is received from a non-client peer, reflect to clients only and EBGP peers.\n* If a route is received from a client peer, reflect to all non-client peers and also to client peers, except the originator of the route and reflect to EBGP peers.\n\n====Cluster====\nRR and its clients form a \"Cluster\". The \"Cluster-ID\" is then attached to every route advertised by RR to its client or nonclient peers. Cluster-ID is a cumulative, non-transitive BGP attribute and every RR MUST prepend the local CLUSTER_ID to the CLUSTER_LIST in order to avoid routing loops.\nRoute reflectors and confederations both reduce the number of iBGP peers to each router and thus reduce processing overhead. Route reflectors are a pure performance-enhancing technique, while confederations also can be used to implement more fine-grained policy.\n\n===BGP confederation===\nConfederations are sets of autonomous systems. In common practice,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5065.txt |title=Info |publisher=www.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref> only one of the confederation AS numbers is seen by the Internet as a whole. Confederations are used in very large networks where a large AS can be configured to encompass smaller more manageable internal ASs.\n\nThe confederated AS is composed of multiple ASs. Each confederated AS alone has iBGP fully meshed and has connections to other ASs inside the confederation. Even though these ASs have eBGP peers to ASs within the confederation, the ASs exchange routing as if they used iBGP. In this way, the confederation preserves next hop, metric, and local preference information. To the outside world, the confederation appears to be a single AS. With this solution, iBGP transit AS problems can be resolved as iBGP requires a full mesh between all BGP routers: large number of TCP sessions and unnecessary duplication of routing traffic.\n\nConfederations can be used in conjunction with route reflectors. Both confederations and route reflectors can be subject to persistent oscillation unless specific design rules, affecting both BGP and the interior routing protocol, are followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3345.txt |title=Info |publisher=www.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref>\n\nHowever, these alternatives can introduce problems of their own, including the following:\n* route oscillation\n* sub-optimal routing\n* increase of BGP convergence time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4098.txt |title=Info |publisher=www.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, route reflectors and BGP confederations were not designed to ease BGP router configuration. Nevertheless, these are common tools for experienced BGP network architects. These tools may be combined, for example, as a hierarchy of route reflectors.\n\n== Stability ==\n\nThe routing tables managed by a BGP implementation are adjusted continually to reflect actual changes in the network, such as links breaking and being restored or routers going down and coming back up. In the network as a whole it is normal for these changes to happen almost continuously, but for any particular router or link, changes are supposed to be relatively infrequent. If a router is misconfigured or mismanaged then it may get into a rapid cycle between down and up states. This pattern of repeated withdrawal and re-announcement known as [[route flapping]] can cause excessive activity in all the other routers that know about the broken link, as the same route is continually injected and withdrawn from the routing tables. The BGP design is such that delivery of traffic may not function while routes are being updated. On the Internet, a BGP routing change may cause outages for several minutes.\n\nA feature known as ''route flap damping'' ([http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2439.txt RFC 2439]) is built into many BGP implementations in an attempt to mitigate the effects of route flapping. Without damping, the excessive activity can cause a heavy processing load on routers, which may in turn delay updates on other routes, and so affect overall routing stability. With damping, a route's flapping is [[exponential decay|exponentially decayed]]. At the first instance when a route becomes unavailable and quickly reappears, damping does not take effect, so as to maintain the normal fail-over times of BGP. At the second occurrence, BGP shuns that prefix for a certain length of time; subsequent occurrences are timed out exponentially. After the abnormalities have ceased and a suitable length of time has passed for the offending route, prefixes can be reinstated and its slate wiped clean. Damping can also mitigate [[denial of service]] attacks; damping timings are highly customizable.\n\nIt is also suggested in RFC 2439 (under \"Design Choices -> Stability Sensitive Suppression of Route Advertisement\") that route flap damping is a feature more desirable if implemented to Exterior Border Gateway Protocol Sessions (eBGP sessions or simply called exterior peers) and not on Interior Border Gateway Protocol Sessions (iBGP sessions or simply called internal peers); With this approach when a route flaps inside an autonomous system, it is not propagated to the external ASs{{snd}} flapping a route to an eBGP will have a chain of flapping for the particular route throughout the backbone. This method also successfully avoids the overhead of route flap damping for iBGP sessions.\n\nHowever, subsequent research has shown that flap damping can actually lengthen convergence times in some cases, and can cause interruptions in connectivity even when links are not flapping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/Papers/sig02.pdf|format=PDF|title=Route Flap Damping Exacerbates Internet Routing Convergence|date=November 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~bzhang/paper/05-icdcs-dtimer.pdf | last = Zhang | first = Beichuan | title = Timer Interaction in Route Flap Damping | accessdate = 2006-09-26 |author2=Pei Dan |author3=Daniel Massey |author4=[[Lixia Zhang]] |date=June 2005 | work = IEEE 25th [[International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems]] | quote = We show that the current damping design leads to the intended behavior only under persistent route flapping.

If the global routing table grows to the point where some older, less capable routers cannot cope with the memory requirements or the CPU load of maintaining the table, these routers will cease to be effective gateways between the parts of the Internet they connect. In addition, and perhaps even more importantly, larger routing tables take longer to stabilize (see above) after a major connectivity change, leaving network service unreliable, or even unavailable, in the interim.\n\nUntil late 2001, the global routing table was [[exponential growth|growing exponentially]], threatening an eventual widespread breakdown of connectivity. In an attempt to prevent this, ISPs cooperated in keeping the global routing table as small as possible, by using [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) and [[route aggregation]]. While this slowed the growth of the routing table to a linear process for several years, with the expanded demand for [[multihoming]] by end user networks the growth was once again superlinear by the middle of 2004.\n\n===512k day===\nWhile a full IPv4 BGP table {{as of|August 2014|lc=on}} (512k day)<ref>as of the 12th of August 2014, multiple [[Router_(computing)|Internet routers]], manufactured by [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] and other vendors, encountered a default software limit of 512K (512,000 - 524,288) {{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/117712-problemsolution-cat6500-00.html#.U-okMKwClYO.twitter  |title=Cisco switch problem}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renesys.com/2014/08/internet-512k-global-routes   |title=Renesys 512k global routes}}</ref> is in excess of 512,000 prefixes,<ref name=\"Potaroo&nbsp;\u2014 BGP Table data\">{{cite web|url=http://bgp.potaroo.net/index-bgp.html|title=BGP Reports|work=potaroo.net}}</ref> many older routers have a limit of 512k (512,000\u2013524,288)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/117712-problemsolution-cat6500-00.html#.U-okMKwClYO.twitter|title=CAT 6500 and 7600 Series Routers and Switches TCAM Allocation Adjustment Procedures|date=9 March 2015|work=Cisco}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renesys.com/2014/08/internet-512k-global-routes/|title=Internet Touches Half Million Routes: Outages Possible Next Week|author=Jim Cowie|work=Dyn Research}}</ref> routing table entries.

On impacted routers, the TCAM is default allocated to 512k entries for IPv4 routes, and 512k entries for IPv6 routes. While the reported number of IPv6 advertised routes was only about 20k, the number of advertised IPv4 routes reached the default limit, causing a [[spillover effect]] as routers attempted to compensate for the issue by using slow software routing (as opposed to fast hardware routing via TCAM). The main method for dealing with this issue involves operators changing the TCAM allocation to allow more IPv4 entries, by reallocating some of the TCAM reserved for IPv6 routes. This requires a reboot on most routers. The 512k problem was predicted in advance by a number of IT professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog39/presentations/bof-report.pdf |title=BOF report |publisher=www.nanog.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://etherealmind.com/tcam-detail-review/|title=TCAM&nbsp;\u2014 a Deeper Look and the impact of IPv6|author=Greg Ferro|work=EtherealMind}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipv4depletion.com/?p=672|title=The IPv4 Depletion site|work=ipv4depletion.com}}</ref>\n\nThe actual allocations which pushed the number of routes above 512k was the announcement of about 15,000 new routes in short order, starting at 07:48 UTC. Almost all of these routes were to [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] [[Autonomous System (Internet)|Autonomous Systems]] 701 and 705, created as a result of [[route aggregation|deaggregation]] of larger blocks, introducing thousands of new [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|{{IPaddr||24}} routes]], and making the routing table reach 515,000 entries. The new routes appear to have been reaggregated within 5 minutes, but instability across the Internet apparently continued for a number of hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bgpmon.net/what-caused-todays-internet-hiccup/|title=What caused today\u2019s Internet hiccup|work=bgpmon.net}}</ref> Even if Verizon had not caused the routing table to exceed 512k entries in the short spike, it would have happened soon anyway through natural growth.\n\nRoute summarization is often used to improve aggregation of the BGP global routing table, thereby reducing the necessary table size in routers of an AS. Consider AS1 has been allocated the big address space of {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}, this would be counted as one route in the table, but due to customer requirement or traffic engineering purposes, AS1 wants to announce smaller, more specific routes of {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|18}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}}, and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}. The prefix {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}} does not have any hosts so AS1 does not announce a specific route {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}}. This all counts as AS1 announcing four routes.\n\nAS2 will see the four routes from AS1 ({{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|18}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}}, and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}) and it is up to the routing policy of AS2 to decide whether or not to take a copy of the four routes or, as {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}} overlaps all the other specific routes, to just store the summary, {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}.\n\nIf AS2 wants to send data to prefix {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}}, it will be sent to the routers of AS1 on route {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0/16}}. At AS1's router, it will either be dropped or a destination unreachable [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] message will be sent back, depending on the configuration of AS1's routers.\n\nIf AS1 later decides to drop the route {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}, leaving {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|18}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}}, and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}, AS1 will drop the number of routes it announces to three. AS2 will see the three routes, and depending on the routing policy of AS2, it will store a copy of the three routes, or aggregate the prefix's {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0/18}} and {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}} to {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|17}}, thereby reducing the number of routes AS2 stores to only two: {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|17}} and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}.\n\nIf AS2 wants to send data to prefix {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}}, it will be dropped or a destination unreachable ICMP message will be sent back at the routers of AS2 (not AS1 as before), because {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}} would not be in the routing table.\n\n=== AS numbers depletion and 32 bits ASN ===\n\nThe RFC 1771 (''A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)'') planned the coding of AS numbers on 16 bits, for 64510 possible public AS, since ASN 64512 to 65534 were reserved for private use (0 and 65535 being forbidden). In 2011, only 15000 AS numbers were still available, and projections<ref>[http://www.potaroo.net/tools/asn16/ ''16-bit Autonomus System Report''], Geoff Huston 2011 (original archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20110906085724/http://www.potaroo.net/tools/asn16/)</ref> were envisioning a complete depletion of available AS numbers in September 2013.\n\nRFC 6793 extends AS coding from 16 to 32 bits (keeping the 16 bits AS range 0 to 65535, and its reserved AS numbers), which now allows up to 4 billion available AS. An additional private AS range is also defined in RFC 6996 (from 4200000000 to 4294967294, 4294967295 being forbidden by RFC 7300).\n\nTo allow the traversal of router groups not able to manage those new ASNs, the new attribute OT AS4_PATH is used.\n\n32 bits ASN assignments started in 2007.\n\n== Load balancing ==\n\nAnother factor causing this growth of the routing table is the need for load balancing of multi-homed networks. It is not a trivial task to balance the inbound traffic to a multi-homed network across its multiple inbound paths, due to limitation of the BGP route selection process. For a multi-homed network, if it announces the same network blocks across all of its BGP peers, the result may be that one or several of its inbound links become congested while the other links remain under-utilized, because external networks all picked that set of congested paths as optimal. Like most other routing protocols, BGP does not detect congestion.\n\nTo work around this problem, BGP administrators of that multihomed network may divide a large contiguous IP address block into smaller blocks and tweak the route announcement to make different blocks look optimal on different paths, so that external networks will choose a different path to reach different blocks of that multi-homed network. Such cases will increase the number of routes as seen on the global BGP table.\n\nOne method growing in popularity to address the load balancing issue is to deploy BGP/LISP ([[Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol]]) gateways within an [[Internet exchange point]] to allow ingress traffic engineering across multiple links. This technique does not increase the number of routes seen on the global BGP table.\n\n== Security ==\n\nBy design, routers running BGP accept advertised routes from other BGP routers by default. This allows for automatic and decentralized routing of traffic across the Internet, but it also leaves the Internet potentially vulnerable to accidental or malicious disruption, known as [[BGP hijacking]]. Due to the extent to which BGP is embedded in the core systems of the Internet, and the number of different networks operated by many different organizations which collectively make up the Internet, correcting this vulnerability (such as by introducing the use of cryptographic keys to verify the identity of BGP routers) is a technically and economically challenging problem.<ref>{{cite news|author=Craig Timberg |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/31/net-of-insecurity-part-2/|title=Quick fix for an early Internet problem lives on a quarter-century later|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2015-05-31 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}</ref>\n\n== Extensions ==\n\nAn extension to BGP is the use of multipathing{{snd}} this typically requires identical MED, weight, origin, and AS-path although some implementations provide the ability to relax the AS-path checking to only expect an equal path length rather than the actual AS numbers in the path being expected to match too. This can then be extended further with features like Cisco's dmzlink-bw which enables a ratio of traffic sharing based on bandwidth values configured on individual links.\n\nMultiprotocol Extensions for BGP (MBGP), sometimes referred to as Multiprotocol BGP or Multicast BGP and defined in IETF <nowiki>RFC 4760</nowiki>, is an extension to (BGP) that allows different types of addresses (known as address families) to be distributed in parallel. Whereas standard BGP supports only IPv4 unicast addresses, Multiprotocol BGP supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and it supports unicast and multicast variants of each. Multiprotocol BGP allows information about the topology of IP multicast-capable routers to be exchanged separately from the topology of normal IPv4 unicast routers. Thus, it allows a multicast routing topology different from the unicast routing topology. Although MBGP enables the exchange of inter-domain multicast routing information, other protocols such as the Protocol Independent Multicast family are needed to build trees and forward multicast traffic.\n\nMultiprotocol BGP is also widely deployed in case of MPLS L3 VPN, to exchange VPN labels learned for the routes from the customer sites over the MPLS network, in order to distinguish between different customer sites when the traffic from the other customer sites comes to the Provider Edge router (PE router) for routing.\n\n== Uses ==\n\nBGP4 is standard for Internet routing and required of most [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) to establish routing between one another. Very large private [[Internet Protocol|IP]] networks use BGP internally. An example is the joining of a number of large [[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF) networks, when OSPF by itself does not scale to the size required. Another reason to use BGP is multihoming a network for better redundancy, either to multiple access points of a single ISP or to multiple ISPs.\n\n== Implementations ==\n\nRouters, especially small ones intended for [[Small office/home office|Small Office/Home Office]] (SOHO) use, may not include BGP software. Some SOHO routers simply are not capable of running BGP / using BGP routing tables of any size. Other commercial routers may need a specific software executable image that contains BGP, or a license that enables it. Open source packages that run BGP include [[GNU Zebra]], [[Quagga (software)|Quagga]], [[OpenBGPD]], [[Bird Internet routing daemon|BIRD]], [[XORP]], and [[Vyatta]]. Devices marketed as [[Layer 3 switch]]es are less likely to support BGP than devices marketed as [[Router (computing)|routers]], but high-end Layer 3 Switches usually can run BGP.\n\nProducts marketed as switches may or may not have a size limitation on BGP tables, such as 20,000 routes, far smaller than a full Internet table plus internal routes. These devices, however, may be perfectly reasonable and useful when used for BGP routing of some smaller part of the network, such as a [[confederation-AS]] representing one of several smaller enterprises that are linked, by a BGP [[backbone of backbones]], or a small enterprise that announces routes to an ISP but only accepts a [[default route]] and perhaps a small number of aggregated routes.\n\nA BGP router used only for a network with a single point of entry to the Internet may have a much smaller routing table size (and hence RAM and CPU requirement) than a multihomed network. Even simple multihoming can have modest routing table size. See RFC 4098 for vendor-independent performance parameters for single BGP router convergence in the control plane. The actual amount of memory required in a BGP router depends on the amount of BGP information exchanged with other BGP speakers and the way in which the particular router stores BGP information. The router may have to keep more than one copy of a route, so it can manage different policies for route advertising and acceptance to a specific neighboring AS. The term view is often used for these different policy relationships on a running router.\n\nIf one router implementation takes more memory per route than another implementation, this may be a legitimate design choice, trading processing speed against memory. A full IPv4 BGP table {{as of|August 2015|lc=on}} is in excess of 590,000 prefixes.<ref name=\"Potaroo&nbsp;\u2014 BGP Table data\"/> Large ISPs may add another 50% for internal and customer routes.

However Conall manages to reverse the trap and causes Belcu's sons to kill Belcu by mistake. The place where the tale occurs was later named Belcu or sometimes Belcon in honour of Belcu.

In April & May succeeding the great Frost in 1740 happened an Accident that gave Birth to a Miracle at this Spring but they could not ascribe the Saint without it was St. Patrick; the water was changed into the Color of Milk & as it was of a fine solf nature it quickly gained the repute of being milk by the Vulgar who flockt from all parts to see it they could not be convinced to the Contrary until it ceased, it continued 7 Weeks. Father O Mulloy thus accounted for it, that the adjacent lands were full of marly bottoms, that this Spring having it's Channel thro those beds of Marl, upon the breaking of the Frost, the marl was loosened & fell into the Spring and gave it the tincture which subsiding it returned to its usual Transparency & then the Wonder ceased.\"<ref>{{cite journal| last=Butler| first=Isaac| editor-last=Cooper| editor-first=Austin| title=A Journey to Lough Derg| journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]]| series=5| volume=II| pages=13\u201324 |year=1892}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E740000-001/index.html|title=A Journey to Lough Derg|website=ucc.ie|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref>}}\n\nSee \"Dabhach Ph\u00e1draig: St Patrick's Holy Well, Belcoo, County Fermanagh\", by Mairead O'Dolain, in the Clogher Record, Volume 18, No. 1, pp.103-116. (viewable on JSTOR).\n\nA modern interpretation however states that the name of the village derives from the {{lang-ga|b\u00e9al}} meaning mouth and {{lang|ga|cumhang}} or {{lang|ga|cung}} meaning narrowing, referring to the village's position on a narrow neck of water (river) between Upper and Lower [[Lough MacNean]]. This interpretation is given support, firstly in the 14th century Book of Magauran where it is mentioned several times as ''Cunga'',<ref name=\"L. McKenna 1947\">{{Citation |author= L. McKenna |title=The Book of Magauran |year=1947 |ref=BM}}</ref> secondly in an Inquisition held at [[Dromahair]] on 22 July 1607 which described the boundaries of [[County Leitrim]] inter alia as- ''and so to Beallacowngamore, and then to Beallucowngabegg'', and thirdly by the name of the place on the 1609 Ulster Plantation map where it is named 'Kiliconge', i.e. ''Coille Cunga'' meaning \"''The Wood of the Narrow Strip of Land''\".<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/Eolas/Data/Brainse/dinnseanchas-1-1964-1965.pdf]</ref> The townland to the immediate north of Belcoo continues this interpretation as it is called Drumcoo, i.e. ''The Hill of the Narrow Strip of Land''. Another often used derivation is {{lang|ga|B\u00e9al C\u00fa}} i.e. where {{lang|ga|C\u00fa}} is the word for hound. Hence the village name would mean \"''The Mouth of the Hound''\".

The Indigenous Resources School of Transferable Skills aims to teach marginalised groups including the unemployed, [[New Age travellers]], the disabled, to use natural materials as a learning facility.\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest mention of the village is in the old Ulster Saga \"{{lang|ga|Argain Belcon Breifne}}\" also known as \"{{lang|ga|Togail Bruidne B\u00e9lchon Br\u00e9ifne}}\" (Massacre of Belcu Brefne). This tells the tale of a trap set for the great Ulster hero [[Conall Cernach]] by a Breifne chief named Belcu Brefne. However Conall manages to reverse the trap and causes Belcu's sons to kill Belcu by mistake. The place where the tale occurs was later named Belcu or sometimes Belcon in honour of Belcu. Isaac Butler in his book \"A Journey to Lough Derg\" written in c. 1749 states-\n\n{{blockquote|At Bell Con in this Neighbourhood on the road to Sligo is a famous Well called Davagh Patrick, or the holy Well it is found by repeated Experience to be the best Cold Bath in the Kingdom, having received Numbers in nervous & paralitic Disorders, & is coming into great request, it is exceeding transparent & so intensely cold that it throws one into a shaking Fit by putting one's hand into it, it exhibits a Stream that turns 2 mills at 150 Yards from the Spring. In April & May succeeding the great Frost in 1740 happened an Accident that gave Birth to a Miracle at this Spring but they could not ascribe the Saint without it was St. Patrick; the water was changed into the Color of Milk & as it was of a fine solf nature it quickly gained the repute of being milk by the Vulgar who flockt from all parts to see it they could not be convinced to the Contrary until it ceased, it continued 7 Weeks. Father O Mulloy thus accounted for it, that the adjacent lands were full of marly bottoms, that this Spring having it's Channel thro those beds of Marl, upon the breaking of the Frost, the marl was loosened & fell into the Spring and gave it the tincture which subsiding it returned to its usual Transparency & then the Wonder ceased.\"<ref>{{cite journal| last=Butler| first=Isaac| editor-last=Cooper| editor-first=Austin| title=A Journey to Lough Derg| journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]]| series=5| volume=II| pages=13\u201324 |year=1892}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E740000-001/index.html|title=A Journey to Lough Derg|website=ucc.ie|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref>}}\n\nA modern interpretation however states that the name of the village derives from the {{lang-ga|b\u00e9al}} meaning mouth and {{lang|ga|cumhang}} or {{lang|ga|cung}} meaning narrowing, referring to the village's position on a narrow neck of water (river) between Upper and Lower [[Lough MacNean]]. This interpretation is given support, firstly in the 14th century Book of Magauran where it is mentioned several times as ''Cunga'',<ref name=\"L. McKenna 1947\">{{Citation |author= L. McKenna |title=The Book of Magauran |year=1947 |ref=BM}}</ref> secondly in an Inquisition held at [[Dromahair]] on 22 July 1607 which described the boundaries of [[County Leitrim]] inter alia as- ''and so to Beallacowngamore, and then to Beallucowngabegg'', and thirdly by the name of the place on the 1609 Ulster Plantation map where it is named 'Kiliconge', i.e. ''Coille Cunga'' meaning \"''The Wood of the Narrow Strip of Land''\".<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/Eolas/Data/Brainse/dinnseanchas-1-1964-1965.pdf]</ref> The townland to the immediate north of Belcoo continues this interpretation as it is called Drumcoo, i.e. ''The Hill of the Narrow Strip of Land''. Another often used derivation is {{lang|ga|B\u00e9al C\u00fa}} i.e. where {{lang|ga|C\u00fa}} is the word for hound. Hence the village name would mean \"''The Mouth of the Hound''\". [[M\u00e1ire MacNeill]] in her book \"The Festival of Lughnasa\", 1962, gives a local Belcoo folktale about balefire coming out of a hound's mouth before it is killed by Saint Patrick.<ref>{{cite book| last=MacNeill| first=M\u00e1ire| title=The festival of Lughnasa: a study of the survival of the Celtic festival of the beginning of harvest| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| location=London| year=1962}}</ref> This tale is also found in Glangevlin folktales.<ref>''Supplement.
