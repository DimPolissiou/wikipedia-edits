A couple years prior, HellBlazer had the idea of an encyclopedia for heavy metal and attempted to create an [[HTML]] page for every metal band by hand. Although he gave up with that initial attempt, a fully automated site with contributions from its users was in the works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://v1.metal-archives.com/miasmainterview.php |title=Encyclopaedia Metallum - Miasma Interview|work=metal-archives.com|accessdate=21 April 2016}}</ref> The site initially went live early in July 2002 and the first band ([[Amorphis]]) was added on July 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Amorphis/1 |title=Amorphis|work=metal-archives.com|accessdate=21 April 2016}}</ref> In just over a year the site had amassed a database of over 10,000 bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/news/view/id/80 |title=10,000 bands!|work=metal-archives.com|accessdate=21 April 2016}}</ref> The site continues to grow at a rate of about 500 bands per month.<ref>{{cite web|title=Band archives - By created date|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/archives/band-list/by/created |website=Encyclopaedia Metallum|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 2013, the site announced that bands with entirely digital discographies could now be submitted to the Archives, changing the site's decade-long policy of physical releases only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/news/view/id/205 |title=Happy New Year!

This started in 2009 with the addition of [[Korn]] into the Metal-Archives and several dozen user reviews praising their first self-titled album, with the news article of the day claiming that the first album was metal enough for the site. A series of staged arguments between moderators appeared throughout the day on the site's forum. 2010 was the year they removed \"The Tavern\" (the general discussion forum) for a day. In 2012 the site posted an FBI logo on the main page, suggesting that the site was suspended by the FBI as a result from the [[Protests against SOPA and PIPA|SOPA and PIPA bill]], which was a much-talked about phenomenon in the media around this time. Despite the ability to bypass this image just by clicking on it, many people took the prank seriously and thought that Metal Archives had actually been shut down for promoting internet piracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/news/view/id/201 |title=Happy April Fools|work=metal-archives.com|accessdate=21 April 2016}}</ref> [[Nickelback]] was added to the Metal-Archives in 2013 in a prank that was similar to the 2009 Korn prank, as it also had user submitted joke reviews praising various Nickelback albums.\n\nIn 2014, the prank consisted on the addition of several (mostly praising) reviews of an EP called ''Penis Metal'' released by Chilean [[black metal]] band Hades Archer, followed by the addition of the band's logo and pictures which included penis on them. The band's style was also changed to ''Penis Metal''. A secondary prank involved the spontaneous deletion of controversial band [[Meshuggah]] (whose genre was listed on the site as \"technical nu-metal/[[djent]]\" and later changed to simply \"djent\"), leading to another series of arguments between moderators on the site's forum, although not to the extent of the 2009 prank. Meshuggah were reinstated the following day. For the 2015 prank a hoax news story was posted \"announcing\" that the site was no longer free to use and the site was introducing paid membership features. A following news post revealed that the previous post was a prank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/news/view/id/225 |title=Announcing upcoming premium membership services|publisher=Metal Archives|date=April 1, 2015|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/news/view/id/226 |title=April Fools|publisher=Metal Archives|date=April 2, 2015|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref> In 2016, following an argument between moderators and users alike on the question of moderating reviews, an announcement was made that reviews were no longer being accepted and that all existing ones would be deleted. Later the same day another announcement was made that the staff had changed their minds by bringing back the reviews as well as having every future review accepted automatically. This resulted in a wave of joke reviews that were deleted from the site the next day.<ref>{{cite web|title=IMPORTANT - Concerning reviews|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/news/view/id/238 |publisher=Metal Archives|accessdate=April 2, 2016|date=April 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=IMPORTANT (AGAIN) - New Review Policy|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/news/view/id/239 |publisher=Metal Archives|accessdate=April 2, 2016|date=April 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the staff members announced that they would now produce articles commentating on the metal scene, and proceeded to post tabloid and gossip articles on the site.

Sherman''' (born October 25, 1949) is an American experimental criminologist and police educator who is the founder of [[evidence-based policing]] and Director of the [[Www.cambridge-ebp.co.uk|Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing]].\n\nSherman's use of randomized controlled [[experiment]]s to study [[Deterrence (psychological)|deterrence]] and [[crime prevention]] has led him to examine such wide-ranging issues as [[domestic violence]], [[saturation patrol]], [[gun violence]], [[crack houses]], and [[reintegrative shaming]]. He has collaborated with over 30 police and justice agencies around the world, and been credited as a key founder of the field of [[experimental criminology]].\n\nSherman holds the posts of Director of the Police Executive Programme<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/courses/police/ Cambridge Police Executive Programme]</ref> and Director of Research at the Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/research/experiments/ Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology]</ref> at the University of Cambridge, where he is [[Wolfson Professor of Criminology]] Emeritus. He is also the Director of the Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing<ref>[http://cambridge-ebp.co.uk Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>, and Editor-in-Chief of the Centre's ''Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing''<ref>[https://link.springer.com/journal/41887 Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>.\n\n==Education==\nSherman graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Denison University]] in 1970, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Political Science]]. He received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[social science]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1970, earned a [[Diploma]] in [[Criminology]] from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1973, and received his M.A. and [[Ph.D.]]in [[sociology]] from [[Yale University]] in 1974 and 1976 respectively.\n\n==Academic career==\nSherman's career began at age 20 in the New York City Mayor's Office and Police Department as an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation [https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/celebratin-40-years-of-urban-fellows/'s New York City Urban Fellow]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and aide to the NYPD's Police Commissioner [[Patrick V. Murphy]], where he began a long research partnership with NYPD Assistant Chief [[Tony Bouza]]. Bouza became the Minneapolis Police Chief in 1980, where he persuaded the City Council to approve Sherman's research design to randomly assign arrest for misdemeanor [[domestic violence]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/individuals/individuals-sherman-and-berk-1984/|title=Individuals \u2013 Sherman & Berk (1984) &#124; Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy}}</ref> later known as the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]]. Sherman's early experimental research into the influence of arrest on recidivism in spouse abuse led to changes in police department policies and procedures nationwide, encouraged state legislatures to modify state statutes to allow for [[misdemeanor]] arrest, and eventually resulted in five federally funded replications, one of which Sherman led in Milwaukee. In the late 1980s, Sherman's discovery of hot spots of crime <ref>New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/nyregion/police-have-done-more-than-prisons-to-cut-crime-in-new-york.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)</ref> led to his experimental research with [[David Weisburd]] and [[Tony Bouza]] that was first to show clear crime prevention effects of directed police patrol in high crime locations. In the early 1990s, Sherman's Kansas City Gun Experiment studied the effect of concentrated police patrol on gun crime and violence and that directed police patrol in gun crime \"hot spots\" led to an increase in seizures of illegally carried guns and a decrease in gun crimes.\n\nSince 1995, Sherman has been co directing a program of prospective longitudinal experiments in restorative justice involving approximately 2,500 offenders and 2,000 crime victims. He has also  worked on the development of new tools for predicting murder among offenders on probation and parole in [[Philadelphia]], as well as randomized trials of intensive services among highest risk offenders.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, Sherman was Greenfield Professor of Human Relations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], initially in the Department of Sociology. Under his leadership, Penn became the first [[Ivy League|Ivy League University]] to establish a Ph.D. in criminology as a separate field in 2000, and the first to establish a separate department of criminology in 2003, when Sherman was appointed the University's first Professor of Criminology. He served as Chair of the University's Department of Criminology from 2003 to 2007 and as the Director of the [[Fels Institute of Government]] from 1999 to 2005. He resigned from Penn in June 2010 to return to the University of Maryland as Distinguished University Professor while jointly serving as Wolfson Professor of Criminology from 2007-2017. Since 2016, he has also served as an Honorary Professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.\n\nSherman also served Maryland as Chair of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice from 1995 to 1999, and as a faculty member from 1982 to 1999. In 1987, he was the Seth Boyden Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Rutgers University]]'s Graduate School of Criminal Justice and from 1994 to 2016 he served as Adjunct Professor of Law at the [[Australian National University]]'s Research School of Social Science and later in the ANU School of Global Governance (RegNet). From 1976 to 1980 he was on the faculty of the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]]'s School of Criminal Justice.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007 he was the co-director of the Justice Research Consortium in the United Kingdom. Since 1995 has been the Scientific Director of RISE, an ongoing research program in partnership with [[Australian National University]] and the [[Australian Federal Police]]. From 1985 to 1995 he served as president of the Crime Control Institute, and from 1979 to 1985 he was the Director of Research and later Vice President for the Washington-D.C.-based [[Police Foundation]].\n\nIn addition to his experimental research, Sherman has published articles and book chapters on a wide variety of topics, including [[police corruption]], police education, police [[discretion]], police crackdowns, [[restorative justice]], investigations, police [[use of force]], and fear reduction. In 1997, Sherman led a team of [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] criminologists in producing Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn't, What's Promising, a Congressionally mandated evaluation of over 500 state and local crime prevention programs.\n\n==Key research findings==\nHis major discoveries can be summarized as follows:\n\n* In 1980, he discovered that restricting police powers to shoot people was not followed by any increases in crime, or in violence against police officers;<ref>Sherman, L. W.  (1983). 'Reducing Police Gun Use:  Critical Events, Administrative Policy and Organizational Change', in Punch, M. (ed.) ''Control in the Police Organization'',  Cambridge, Massachusetts:  M.I.T. Press.</ref> this evidence was later cited by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in its 1985 [[Tennessee v. Garner]] decision to restrict police powers to kill across the US.\n* In 1984, the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]] found that arresting suspects in [[domestic violence]] cases was more effective at reducing [[Recidivism|re-offending]] than counselling or temporarily separating the suspect and victim.<ref name=\"sherman1984-pf\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/minneapolisdve.pdf |title=The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment |date=April 1984 |author1=Sherman, Lawrence W. |author2=Richard A.

He showed that exactly where and when crime will occur is far more predictable than anyone had previously thought, thus laying the theoretical and empirical basis for what is now called \"hot spots policing,\" now widely practiced from New York to Sydney.<ref>Sherman L.

His core idea was that police practice can be made far more effective if all of its complex but repeated elements were tested by repeated controlled field experiments. In February 2000, Sherman co-founded the [[Campbell collaboration]]'s Crime and Justice Group, which has pursued the synthesis of research evidence on the effectiveness of policing and other crime prevention practices. Since then, the [[FBI Academy]] has offered a course on [[evidence-based policing]], and it has become the subject of wide debate and commentary in police practice and research journals.\n\nIn 2008, Sherman made evidence-based policing (EBP) the core of the Police Executive Programme at Cambridge University, a part-time course of study for senior police leaders from around the world to earn a Diploma or Master's in applied criminology. In that year, the [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] (NPIA) funded the first international conference on EBP, which was attended by police executives from Asia, Australia, Europe and the US. Since then the conference has been held each July, with the 5th International Conference attended by over 250 police and scholars from six continents, including Africa and Latin America.\n\nIn 2010, a group of UK police officers founded the [http://www.sebp.police.uk Society of Evidence-Based Policing], and elected Sherman its first Honorary President, along with [[Peter Fahy|Sir Peter Fahy]], [[Chief Constable]] of the UK's [[Greater Manchester Police]] (see http://sebp.police.uk/index.php); as of 2014 the Society has over 1,000 members, primarily UK police officers but with membership from Australia to Argentina and North America. In 2013, police in collaboration with the University of Queensland established the Australian-New Zealand Society of Evidence-Based Policing, which now has over 500 members (see http://www.anzsebp.com/index.php). In 2015, both Canada (see https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072800/http://www.can-sebp.net/index.php) and the United States (see http://www.evidencebasedpolicing.org/index.php) established their own branches of this learned professional society. In 2013, UK [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] appointed Sherman an independent non-executive director of the new [[College of Policing]], which develops and promotes evidence of what works in policing.\n\n==Institution building==\n\nSherman has been a prime mover in the development on several permanent new additions to the institutional landscape of criminology. The most visible of these new institutions is the [[Stockholm Prize in Criminology]], which philanthropist [[Jerry Lee]] and Sherman proposed to Professor [[Jerzy Sarnecki]] of [[Stockholm University]] in mid-2000, and which Sarnecki brought to the Swedish Ministry of Justice where it received support from successive Ministers. The annual Prize for criminological research or its application that benefits humanity was funded by the [[Jerry Lee]] Foundation for a guaranteed minimum of ten years, with the first prizes awarded in 2006. The Prize has been awarded annually since then, most often presented by a member of the Royal Family, with Sherman and Sarnecki as co-chairs of the International Jury that selects the winners. In 2012, Justice Minister Beatrice Ask concluded an agreement with the Soderberg foundations to provide joint funding with Ministry investment of a permanent endowment for a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20120712062254/http://www.criminologyprize.com/extra/pod/ Stockholm Prize Foundation], which guarantees annual funding of the Prize in perpetuity.\n\nSherman has also founded or helped to found the Academy of Experimental Criminology (in 1999), the Division of Experimental Criminology of the [[American Society of Criminology]] (in 2009), the [[Campbell Collaboration]] and its Crime and Justice Group (in 2000), the first Department of Criminology in the [[Ivy League]]\u2014at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (in 2003) and its [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] and [[Master's degree|MA]] degrees (in 2001), its [[Master of Science]] (2004), and its Jerry Lee Center of Criminology (in 2001). He also founded the first centre for experimental criminology in 2008, the Jerry Lee Centre of Experimental Criminology at the [[Cambridge Institute of Criminology|University of Cambridge Institute of Criminology]].<ref>University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences, {{cite web |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/people/lsherman.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724050856/http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/people/lsherman.htm |archivedate=2008-07-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Former students==\n\nSherman's students have included University of Cincinnati Professor John Eck, University of Pennsylvania Professor John MacDonald, George Mason University Professors Cynthia Lum and Christopher Koper, London School of Economics Professor Meredith Rossner, University of Pennsylvania Research Professor Geoffrey Barnes, and former Thames Valley Police and National Policing Improvement agency Chief Constable Peter Neyroud, President of the American Society of Evidence-Based Policing and working police sergeant, Renee J. Mitchell, Matthew T. Mangino, former member of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and former district attorney of Lawrence County, Pennsylvania.

Sherman's work in establishing the Stockholm Prize in Criminology was recognized by the King of Sweden in 2016, who appointed Sherman a Knight \"Commander of the Royal Order of the Northern Star\" (KNO).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/press/news/2016/06/lawrence-sherman-knighted-king-sweden | title=Lawrence Sherman Knighted by King of Sweden &#124; Faculty of Law}}</ref> In 2017, Yale University Graduate School awarded him a [[Wilbur Cross Medal]] for public service, and the [[University of Bialystok]] awarded him its medal for services to criminology. In 2011, the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him its [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)]] for his work on evidence-based crime prevention, and in 2009 he won the Beccaria Gold Medal of the Criminology Society of German-Speaking Countries.  \n \nIn 2013 the [[Stockholm University|University of Stockholm]] awarded him an honorary doctorate in social science, and [[George Mason University]] presented him its Award for Distinguished Achievement in Evidence-Based Crime Policy. In 2014 [[Denison University]] awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.\n\nIn 1998 he was elected the Founding President of the Academy of Experimental Criminology<ref>\"AEC Presidents: Lawrence W.

Sherman''' (born October 25, 1949) is an American experimental criminologist and police educator who is the founder of [[evidence-based policing]].\n\nSherman's use of randomized controlled [[experiment]]s to study [[Deterrence (psychological)|deterrence]] and [[crime prevention]] has led him to examine such wide-ranging issues as [[domestic violence]], [[saturation patrol]], [[gun violence]], [[crack houses]], and [[reintegrative shaming]]. He has collaborated with over 30 police and justice agencies around the world, and been credited as a key founder of the field of [[experimental criminology]].\n\nSherman holds the posts of Director of the Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/research/experiments/ Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology]</ref> and [[Wolfson Professor of Criminology]] Emeritus at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he is also Chair of the Cambridge Police Executive Program.<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/courses/police/ Cambridge Police Executive Programme]</ref> He is also  the Director of the Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing,<ref>[http://cambridge-ebp.co.uk Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing]</ref> and Editor-in-Chief of the Centre's Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing.<ref>[https://link.springer.com/journal/41887 Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>\n\n==Education==\nSherman graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Denison University]] in 1970, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Political Science]]. He received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[social science]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1970, earned a [[Diploma]] in [[Criminology]] from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1973, and received his M.A. and [[Ph.D.]]in [[sociology]] from [[Yale University]] in 1974 and 1976 respectively.\n\n==Academic career==\nSherman's career began at age 20 in the New York City Mayor's Office and Police Department as an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation [https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/celebratin-40-years-of-urban-fellows/'s New York City Urban Fellow]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and aide to the NYPD's Police Commissioner [[Patrick V. Murphy]], where he began a long research partnership with NYPD Assistant Chief [[Tony Bouza]]. Bouza became the Minneapolis Police Chief in 1980, where he persuaded the City Council to approve Sherman's research design to randomly assign arrest for misdemeanor [[domestic violence]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/individuals/individuals-sherman-and-berk-1984/|title=Individuals \u2013 Sherman & Berk (1984) &#124; Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy}}</ref> later known as the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]]. Sherman's early experimental research into the influence of arrest on recidivism in spouse abuse led to changes in police department policies and procedures nationwide, encouraged state legislatures to modify state statutes to allow for [[misdemeanor]] arrest, and eventually resulted in five federally funded replications, one of which Sherman led in Milwaukee. In the late 1980s, Sherman's discovery of hot spots of crime <ref>New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/nyregion/police-have-done-more-than-prisons-to-cut-crime-in-new-york.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)</ref> led to his experimental research with [[David Weisburd]] and [[Tony Bouza]] that was first to show clear crime prevention effects of directed police patrol in high crime locations. In the early 1990s, Sherman's Kansas City Gun Experiment studied the effect of concentrated police patrol on gun crime and violence and that directed police patrol in gun crime \"hot spots\" led to an increase in seizures of illegally carried guns and a decrease in gun crimes.\n\nSince 1995, Sherman has been co directing a program of prospective longitudinal experiments in restorative justice involving approximately 2,500 offenders and 2,000 crime victims. He has also  worked on the development of new tools for predicting murder among offenders on probation and parole in [[Philadelphia]], as well as randomized trials of intensive services among highest risk offenders.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, Sherman was Greenfield Professor of Human Relations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], initially in the Department of Sociology. Under his leadership, Penn became the first [[Ivy League|Ivy League University]] to establish a Ph.D. in criminology as a separate field in 2000, and the first to establish a separate department of criminology in 2003, when Sherman was appointed the University's first Professor of Criminology. He served as Chair of the University's Department of Criminology from 2003 to 2007 and as the Director of the [[Fels Institute of Government]] from 1999 to 2005. He resigned from Penn in June 2010 to return to the University of Maryland as Distinguished University Professor while jointly serving as Wolfson Professor of Criminology from 2007-2017. Since 2016, he has also served as an Honorary Professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.\n\nSherman also served Maryland as Chair of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice from 1995 to 1999, and as a faculty member from 1982 to 1999. In 1987, he was the Seth Boyden Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Rutgers University]]'s Graduate School of Criminal Justice and from 1994 to 2016 he served as Adjunct Professor of Law at the [[Australian National University]]'s Research School of Social Science and later in the ANU School of Global Governance (RegNet). From 1976 to 1980 he was on the faculty of the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]]'s School of Criminal Justice.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007 he was the co-director of the Justice Research Consortium in the United Kingdom. Since 1995 has been the Scientific Director of RISE, an ongoing research program in partnership with [[Australian National University]] and the [[Australian Federal Police]]. From 1985 to 1995 he served as president of the Crime Control Institute, and from 1979 to 1985 he was the Director of Research and later Vice President for the Washington-D.C.-based [[Police Foundation]].\n\nIn addition to his experimental research, Sherman has published articles and book chapters on a wide variety of topics, including [[police corruption]], police education, police [[discretion]], police crackdowns, [[restorative justice]], investigations, police [[use of force]], and fear reduction. In 1997, Sherman led a team of [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] criminologists in producing Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn't, What's Promising, a Congressionally mandated evaluation of over 500 state and local crime prevention programs.\n\n==Key research findings==\nHis major discoveries can be summarized as follows:\n\n* In 1980, he discovered that restricting police powers to shoot people was not followed by any increases in crime, or in violence against police officers;<ref>Sherman, L. W.  (1983). 'Reducing Police Gun Use:  Critical Events, Administrative Policy and Organizational Change', in Punch, M. (ed.) ''Control in the Police Organization'',  Cambridge, Massachusetts:  M.I.T. Press.</ref> this evidence was later cited by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in its 1985 [[Tennessee v. Garner]] decision to restrict police powers to kill across the US.\n* In 1984, the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]] found that arresting suspects in [[domestic violence]] cases was more effective at reducing [[Recidivism|re-offending]] than counselling or temporarily separating the suspect and victim.<ref name=\"sherman1984-pf\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/minneapolisdve.pdf |title=The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment |date=April 1984 |author1=Sherman, Lawrence W. |author2=Richard A.

He showed that exactly where and when crime will occur is far more predictable than anyone had previously thought, thus laying the theoretical and empirical basis for what is now called \"hot spots policing,\" now widely practiced from New York to Sydney.<ref>Sherman L.

The paper and the concept won an award from [http://www.research-strategy.admin.cam.ac.uk/impact/vice-chancellors-awards Cambridge University's Vice Chancellor].\n\nResearch on the prestige of scholars in criminology and criminal justice has listed Sherman as one of the most highly cited scholars in the field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohn | first1 = E.

His core idea was that police practice can be made far more effective if all of its complex but repeated elements were tested by repeated controlled field experiments. In February 2000, Sherman co-founded the [[Campbell collaboration]]'s Crime and Justice Group, which has pursued the synthesis of research evidence on the effectiveness of policing and other crime prevention practices. Since then, the [[FBI Academy]] has offered a course on [[evidence-based policing]], and it has become the subject of wide debate and commentary in police practice and research journals.\n\nIn 2008, Sherman made evidence-based policing (EBP) the core of the Police Executive Programme at Cambridge University, a part-time course of study for senior police leaders from around the world to earn a Diploma or Master's in applied criminology. In that year, the [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] (NPIA) funded the first international conference on EBP, which was attended by police executives from Asia, Australia, Europe and the US. Since then the conference has been held each July, with the 5th International Conference attended by over 250 police and scholars from six continents, including Africa and Latin America.\n\nIn 2010, a group of UK police officers founded the [http://www.sebp.police.uk Society of Evidence-Based Policing], and elected Sherman its first Honorary President, along with [[Peter Fahy|Sir Peter Fahy]], [[Chief Constable]] of the UK's [[Greater Manchester Police]] (see http://sebp.police.uk/index.php); as of 2014 the Society has over 1,000 members, primarily UK police officers but with membership from Australia to Argentina and North America. In 2013, police in collaboration with the University of Queensland established the Australian-New Zealand Society of Evidence-Based Policing, which now has over 500 members (see http://www.anzsebp.com/index.php). In 2015, both Canada (see https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072800/http://www.can-sebp.net/index.php) and the United States (see http://www.evidencebasedpolicing.org/index.php) established their own branches of this learned professional society. In 2013, UK [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] appointed Sherman an independent non-executive director of the new [[College of Policing]], which develops and promotes evidence of what works in policing.\n\n==Institution building==\n\nSherman has been a prime mover in the development on several permanent new additions to the institutional landscape of criminology. The most visible of these new institutions is the [[Stockholm Prize in Criminology]], which philanthropist [[Jerry Lee]] and Sherman proposed to Professor [[Jerzy Sarnecki]] of [[Stockholm University]] in mid-2000, and which Sarnecki brought to the Swedish Ministry of Justice where it received support from successive Ministers. The annual Prize for criminological research or its application that benefits humanity was funded by the [[Jerry Lee]] Foundation for a guaranteed minimum of ten years, with the first prizes awarded in 2006. The Prize has been awarded annually since then, most often presented by a member of the Royal Family, with Sherman and Sarnecki as co-chairs of the International Jury that selects the winners. In 2012, Justice Minister Beatrice Ask concluded an agreement with the Soderberg foundations to provide joint funding with Ministry investment of a permanent endowment for a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20120712062254/http://www.criminologyprize.com/extra/pod/ Stockholm Prize Foundation], which guarantees annual funding of the Prize in perpetuity.\n\nSherman has also founded or helped to found the Academy of Experimental Criminology (in 1999), the Division of Experimental Criminology of the [[American Society of Criminology]] (in 2009), the [[Campbell Collaboration]] and its Crime and Justice Group (in 2000), the first Department of Criminology in the [[Ivy League]]\u2014at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (in 2003) and its [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] and [[Master's degree|MA]] degrees (in 2001), its [[Master of Science]] (2004), and its Jerry Lee Center of Criminology (in 2001). He also founded the first centre for experimental criminology in 2008, the Jerry Lee Centre of Experimental Criminology at the [[Cambridge Institute of Criminology|University of Cambridge Institute of Criminology]].<ref>University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences, {{cite web |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/people/lsherman.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724050856/http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/people/lsherman.htm |archivedate=2008-07-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Former students==\n\nSherman's students have included University of Cincinnati Professor John Eck, University of Pennsylvania Professor John MacDonald, George Mason University Professors Cynthia Lum and Christopher Koper, London School of Economics Professor Meredith Rossner, University of Pennsylvania Research Professor Geoffrey Barnes, and former Thames Valley Police and National Policing Improvement agency Chief Constable Peter Neyroud, President of the American Society of Evidence-Based Policing and working police sergeant, Renee J. Mitchell, Matthew T. Mangino, former member of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and former district attorney of Lawrence County, Pennsylvania. His currently serving police executive students include   Stephen Williams, Acting Commissioner of Police, [[Trinidad and Tobago Police Service]]; from the UK, Chief Constables [[Sara Thornton (police officer)|Sara Thornton]] ([[Thames Valley Police]]), Simon Bailey ([[Norfolk Constabulary]]), John Parkinson ([[West Yorkshire Police]]), and Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale ([[West Midlands Police]]); and Police Chief William Farrar, from the [[Rialto Police Department]], [[California]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\nSherman has been the recipient of numerous honors and awards for his work in the field of criminology and policing. Sherman's work in establishing the Stockholm Prize in Criminology was recognized by the King of Sweden in 2016, who appointed Sherman a Knight \"Commander of the Royal Order of the Northern Star\" (KNO).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/press/news/2016/06/lawrence-sherman-knighted-king-sweden | title=Lawrence Sherman Knighted by King of Sweden &#124; Faculty of Law}}</ref> In 2017, Yale University Graduate School awarded him a [[Wilbur Cross Medal]] for public service, and the [[University of Bialystok]] awarded him its medal for services to criminology. In 2011, the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him its [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)]] for his work on evidence-based crime prevention, and in 2009 he won the Beccaria Gold Medal of the Criminology Society of German-Speaking Countries.  \n \nIn 2013 the [[Stockholm University|University of Stockholm]] awarded him an honorary doctorate in social science, and [[George Mason University]] presented him its Award for Distinguished Achievement in Evidence-Based Crime Policy. In 2014 [[Denison University]] awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.\n\nIn 1998 he was elected the Founding President of the Academy of Experimental Criminology<ref>\"AEC Presidents: Lawrence W.

The total area is 43.79% water.  Menlo Park is long and narrow on a northeast to southwest axis.  The northeast portion borders the San Francisco Bay and includes the [[Dumbarton Bridge (California)|Dumbarton Bridge]] that connects Menlo Park to [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] on the east side of the bay.  The city shoreline includes the city's largest park, Bedwell Bayfront Park {{convert|160|acre|ha}} and the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]].<ref name=\"bedwell\">{{cite web|title=Bedwell Bayfront Park|url=https://www.menlopark.org/Facilities/Facility/Details/Bedwell-Bayfront-Park-6|website=Menlo Park, CA|accessdate=February 4, 2017|language=en}}</ref>  [[San Francisquito Creek]] marks much of the southeast border of the city. [[West Menlo Park]] (not part of the city despite its name) along [[Alameda de las Pulgas]] nearly separates the southwestern part of the city (known as Sharon Heights) from the rest. The extreme southwest is clipped by [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]].\n\nThe [[Bayshore Freeway]] (part of [[U.S. Route 101]])  traverses Menlo Park northwest to southeast near the shoreline and somewhat parallel to it to the southwest is [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]].  The intersection of El Camino Real and  Santa Cruz Avenue is considered the heart of the city. Nearby, the Menlo Park [[Civic center]] is bounded by Ravenswood Avenue, Alma Street, Laurel Street and Burgess Drive. It contains the [[City council|council]] offices, library, police station and ''Burgess Park'' which has various recreational facilities.  Other major roads include [[Sand Hill Road]] in the Sharon Heights area.\n\nThe residential areas of Menlo Park can be unofficially divided into several neighborhoods. From \"east\" (northeast toward [[San Francisco Bay]]) to \"west\" (southwest toward the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast), they are defined by the ''[[Palo Alto Weekly]]'' as follows:<ref name=\"PAO-neighborhoods\">{{cite news|url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2010/02/02/menlo-park-neighborhoods|title=Menlo Park neighborhoods|date=February 9, 2017|accessdate=February 10, 2017|publisher=Palo Alto Online|language=en}}</ref> Belle Haven is the only neighborhood east of Route 101; much of the rest of that area is business or protected land.  Between 101 and the roughly parallel Middlefield Road are the neighborhoods of the Willows, Suburban Park, Lorelei Manor, Flood Triangle, Vintage Oaks, and South of Seminary (the seminary being [[Saint Patrick's Seminary and University|Saint Patrick's Seminary]]). Between Middlefield and El Camino Real are the [[Caltrain]] track and Felton Gables, Linfield Oaks, and Park Forest.  West of El Camino until the foothills of the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] are the neighborhoods of Downtown Menlo Park, Central Menlo Park, and Allied Arts (sometimes also known as Stanford Park, it is named for the [[Allied Arts Guild]] in it). In the hills are Sharon Heights and Stanford Hills.

Menlo Park is one of the most educated cities in the state of California and the United States;  nearly 70% of residents over the age of 25 have earned a bachelor's degree or higher.<ref name=\"California's Most Educated Cities\">{{cite news | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/17/californias-most-educated-cities_n_1100129.html | title = California's Most Educated Cities: Palo Alto, Los Altos Top the List | publisher = The Huffington Post Online| accessdate = September 9, 2012 | first=Carly | last=Schwartz | date=November 17, 2011}}</ref> Menlo Park had 32,026 inhabitants according to the [[2010 United States Census]], which had grown to an estimated 34,549 inhabitants by 2018.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/state_census_data_center/census_2010/documents/2010Census_Table3A_RedistrictingFile.xls |title=Census 2010: Table 3A \u2013 Total Population by Race (Hispanic exclusive) and Hispanic or Latino: 2010 |format=Excel |publisher=[[California Department of Finance]] |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002449/http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/state_census_data_center/census_2010/documents/2010Census_Table3A_RedistrictingFile.xls |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/menloparkcitycalifornia/PST045217|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Menlo Park city, California|website=www.census.gov|language=en|access-date=January 28, 2018}}</ref> The city is home to the corporate headquarters of  [[Facebook]] and where [[Google LLC|Google]] and [[Round Table Pizza]] were founded.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|17.4|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|9.8|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|7.6|sqmi}} is water. The total area is 43.79% water.  Menlo Park is long and narrow on a northeast to southwest axis.  The northeast portion borders the San Francisco Bay and includes the [[Dumbarton Bridge (California)|Dumbarton Bridge]] that connects Menlo Park to [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] on the east side of the bay.  The city shoreline includes the city's largest park, Bedwell Bayfront Park {{convert|160|acre|ha}} and the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]].<ref name=\"bedwell\">{{cite web|title=Bedwell Bayfront Park|url=https://www.menlopark.org/Facilities/Facility/Details/Bedwell-Bayfront-Park-6|website=Menlo Park, CA|accessdate=February 4, 2017|language=en}}</ref>  [[San Francisquito Creek]] marks much of the southeast border of the city. [[West Menlo Park]] (not part of the city despite its name) along [[Alameda de las Pulgas]] nearly separates the southwestern part of the city (known as Sharon Heights) from the rest. The extreme southwest is clipped by [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]].\n\nThe [[Bayshore Freeway]] (part of [[U.S. Route 101]])  traverses Menlo Park northwest to southeast near the shoreline and somewhat parallel to it to the southwest is [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]].  The intersection of El Camino Real and  Santa Cruz Avenue is considered the heart of the city. Nearby, the Menlo Park [[Civic center]] is bounded by Ravenswood Avenue, Alma Street, Laurel Street and Burgess Drive. It contains the [[City council|council]] offices, library, police station and ''Burgess Park'' which has various recreational facilities.  Other major roads include [[Sand Hill Road]] in the Sharon Heights area.\n\nThe residential areas of Menlo Park can be unofficially divided into several neighborhoods. From \"east\" (northeast toward [[San Francisco Bay]]) to \"west\" (southwest toward the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast), they are defined by the ''[[Palo Alto Weekly]]'' as follows:<ref name=\"PAO-neighborhoods\">{{cite news|url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2010/02/02/menlo-park-neighborhoods|title=Menlo Park neighborhoods|date=February 9, 2017|accessdate=February 10, 2017|publisher=Palo Alto Online|language=en}}</ref> Belle Haven is the only neighborhood east of Route 101; much of the rest of that area is business or protected land.  Between 101 and the roughly parallel Middlefield Road are the neighborhoods of the Willows, Suburban Park, Lorelei Manor, Flood Triangle, Vintage Oaks, and South of Seminary (the seminary being [[Saint Patrick's Seminary and University|Saint Patrick's Seminary]]). Between Middlefield and El Camino Real are the [[Caltrain]] track and Felton Gables, Linfield Oaks, and Park Forest.  West of El Camino until the foothills of the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] are the neighborhoods of Downtown Menlo Park, Central Menlo Park, and Allied Arts (sometimes also known as Stanford Park, it is named for the [[Allied Arts Guild]] in it). In the hills are Sharon Heights and Stanford Hills.  Several other neighborhoods are closely associated with Menlo Park but are actually in unincorporated San Mateo county; these include [[Menlo Oaks, California|Menlo Oaks]] and Fair Oaks (latter part of the [[North Fair Oaks, California|North Fair Oaks]] census area) between Bayshore and Middlefield, University Heights (also known as West Menlo Park) between Sharon Heights and most of the rest of the city, and Stanford Weekend Acres which is somewhat near Stanford Hills.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Menlo Park station postcard.jpg|thumb|left|Menlo Park Station, ca. 1918]]\nThe area of Menlo Park was inhabited by the [[Ohlone]] people when the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] arrived in 1769.<ref>{{cite web |title=CHL # 2 Portol\u00e1 Journey's End San Mateo |url=https://www.californiahistoricallandmarks.com/landmarks/chl-2 |website=www.californiahistoricallandmarks.com |accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref>     \n\nIn 1795 the [[Rancho de las Pulgas]] land grant was made that include the area of the current city.\n\nIn 1851 two Irish immigrants, Dennis J.
