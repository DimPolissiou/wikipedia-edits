The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, placing her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single reached number five in the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark, eventually attaining a silver certification in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer.

It was released as a [[Single (music)|single]] on May 21, 2000, after an unfinished version leaked to radio. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, placing her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single reached number five in the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark, eventually attaining a silver certification in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer.
