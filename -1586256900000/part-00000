This kind of respirator is reusable, with the filters being replaced periodically.]]\n\nA '''respirator''' is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres, including [[wikt:fumes|fumes]], [[vapor|vapours]], [[gases]] and [[particulate matter]] such as dusts and airborne [[microorganisms]]. There are two main categories: the ''air-purifying respirator'', in which respirable air is obtained by filtering a contaminated atmosphere, and the ''air-supplied respirator'', in which an alternate supply of breathable air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants.\n\nAir-purifying respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable face masks sometimes referred to as a [[dust mask]] to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges often called a [[gas mask]].\n\n==Physical form==\n[[File:NIOSH P95 cross section.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Cross-section of [[NIOSH air filtration rating|NIOSH-approved]] P95 filters used in [[metalworking]] operations. Even \"clean\" industrial processes often generate large amounts of harmful particulate matter and require breathing protection.]]\nAll respirators have some type of facepiece held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method.  Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The differences in respirator design impact the [[respirator assigned protection factors]], i.e. the resulting degree of protection from which kind of hazard.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThere are three categories of particulate respirators: particulate-filtering facepiece respirators are discarded when they become unsuitable for further use due to considerations of hygiene, excessive resistance, or physical damage; elastomeric respirators are reusable because the facepiece is cleaned and reused, but the filter cartridges are discarded and replaced when they become unsuitable for further use; and [[Powered air-purifying respirator|powered air-purifying respirators]] have a battery-powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource1quest1.html|title=Respirator Trusted-Source Information: What are they?|last=|first=|date=2018-01-29|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nRespirators can have half-face forms that cover the bottom half of the face including the nose and mouth, and full-face forms that cover the entire face. Half-face respirators should only be worn in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is spray painting could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with [[chlorine]] gas would have to wear a full-face respirator.\n\n== Types of filtration ==\n\n=== Air-purifying ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Personal protective equipment]] -->\n[[File:Police officer wearing half-mask respirator.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Protective P100 filter mask worn by NYPD officer]]\nAir-purifying respirators are used against particulates, gases, and vapors that are at atmospheric concentrations less than immediately dangerous to life and health. This includes:\n\n*[[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative-pressure]] respirators using mechanical filters and chemical media\n*[[positive pressure|positive-pressure]] units such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)\n*Escape Only respirators or hoods such as Air-Purifying Escape Respirators for use by the general public for [[chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear]]  (CBRN) terrorism incidents.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFull hood, half- or full-facepiece designs are marketed in many varieties depending on the hazard of concern using an [[air filter]] which acts passively on air inhaled by the wearer. Two common examples of this type of respirator are single-use escape hoods and filter masks. The latter are typically simple, light, single-piece, half-face masks and employ the first three mechanical filter mechanisms in the list below to remove particulates from the air stream.  The most common of these is the disposable white N95 variety. It is discarded after single use or some extended period depending on the contaminant. Filter masks also come in replaceable-cartridge, multiple-use models. Typically one or two cartridges attach securely to a mask which has built into it a corresponding number of valves for inhalation and one for exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) and the [[International Safety Equipment Association]] (ISEA) established the American National Standard for Air-Purifying Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices to define both test criteria and approval methods for fire/smoke escape hoods. ANSI/ISEA Standard 110 provides design guidance to manufacturers of Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices (RPED) in the form of performance requirements and testing procedures. The standard covers certification, ISO registration for the manufacturer, associated test methods, labeling, conditioning requirements, independent process and quality control audits, and follow-up inspection programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://safetyequipment.org/c/std110-2009.cfm |title=International Safety Equipment Association |publisher=Safetyequipment.org |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> ANSI/ISEA 110 was prepared by members of the ISEA RPED group, in consultation with testing laboratories and was reviewed by a consensus panel representing users, health and safety professionals and government representatives.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission uses ANSI/ISEA 110 as the benchmark in their testing of fire escape masks.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Mechanical filter====\nMechanical filter respirators retain particulate matter such as dust created during [[woodwork]]ing or metal processing, when contaminated air is passed through the filter material. Wool is still used today as a filter, along with plastic, glass, cellulose, and combinations of two or more of these materials. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[File:Atemluftfilter Einwegmaske.jpg|thumb|Filtering half mask with exhalation valve (class: FFP3)]]\n\nMechanical filters remove contaminants from air in the following ways:\n\n# by ''interception'' when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it;\n# by ''impaction'', when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity\n# by an enhancing mechanism called ''diffusion'', where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100&nbsp;nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter; this effect is similar to [[Brownian motion]] and increases the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the two mechanisms above; it becomes dominant at lower air flow velocities\n# by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an [[electrostatic charge]] that holds them on the filter surface;\n# by using gravity and allowing particles to settle into the filter material (this effect is typically negligible); and\n# by using the particles themselves, after the filter has been used, to act as a filter medium for other particles.\n\t\nConsidering only particulates carried on an air stream and a fiber mesh filter, diffusion predominates below the 0.1 \u03bcm diameter particle size. Impaction and interception predominate above 0.4 \u03bcm. In between, near the 0.3 \u03bcm most penetrating particle size, diffusion and interception predominate.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFor maximum efficiency of particle removal and to decrease resistance to airflow through the filter, particulate filters are designed to keep the velocity of air flow through the filter as low as possible. This is achieved by manipulating the slope and shape of the filter to provide larger surface area.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nA substantial advance in mechanical filter technology was{{when|date=March 2017}} the [[HEPA]] filter. A HEPA filter can remove as much as 99.97% of all airborne particulates with aerodynamic diameter of 0.3 \u03bcm, particles both smaller and larger are removed with an efficiency >99.97%.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-136/pdfs/2003-136.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2003136|title=Guidance for Filtration and Air-Cleaning Systems to Protect Building Environments from Airborne Chemical, Biological, or Radiological Attacks|publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|date=April 2003|isbn=|location=Cincinnati, OH|pages=8\u201312|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2003136|access-date=February 9, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====== U.S. standards (N95 and others) ======\n{{See also|N95 mask}}\nIn the [[United States]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] defines the following categories of particulate filters according to their [[NIOSH air filtration rating]] as of 2011:<ref name=\"fact sheet\">{{cite journal| last1 = Metzler | first1 = R| last2 = Szalajda | first2 = J | title = NIOSH Fact Sheet: NIOSH Approval Labels - Key Information to Protect Yourself | journal = DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2011-179 | year = 2011 | url =https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-179/pdfs/2011-179.pdf | issn =0343-6993}}</ref>\n\n[[File:What it Means to be NIOSH-Approved - A look into N95 Certification Testing.webm|thumb|right|300px|A video describing N95 certification testing]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There are different units for different environments. The units consist of a powered [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] which forces incoming air through one or more [[filter (air)|filter]]s to the user for breathing. The fan and filters may be carried by the user or they may be remotely mounted and the user breathes the air through tubing.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe filter type must be matched to the contaminants that need to be removed. Some PAPR's are designed to remove fine particulate matter, while others are suitable for working with [[volatile organic compound]]s as those in [[spray paint]]s. These must have their filter elements replaced more often than a particulate filter.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)===\n{{Main|Self-contained breathing apparatus}}\n\nA self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) typically has three main components: a high-pressure air cylinder (e.g., 2200 psi to 4500 psi), a pressure gauge and regulator, and an inhalation connection (mouthpiece, mouth mask or full face mask), connected together and mounted to a carrying frame or a harness with adjustable shoulder straps and belt so it can be worn on the back. There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOpen-circuit industrial breathing sets are filled with filtered, compressed air. The compressed air passes through a regulator, is inhaled and exhaled out of the circuit, quickly depleting the supply of air. Air cylinders are made of aluminum, steel, or of a composite construction like fiberglass-wrapped aluminum. The \"positive pressure\" type is common, which supplies a steady stream of air to stop fumes or smoke from leaking into the mask. Other SCBA's are of the \"demand\" type, which only supply air when the regulator senses the user inhaling. All fire departments and those working in toxic environments use the positive pressure SCBA for safety reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe closed-circuit type SCBA filters, supplements, and recirculates exhaled gas like a [[rebreather]]. It is used when a longer-duration supply of breathing gas is needed, such as in mine rescue and in long tunnels, and going through passages too narrow for a large open-circuit air cylinder.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Industries using respirators==\nA wide range of industries use respirators including healthcare & pharmaceuticals, defense & public safety services (defense, firefighting & law enforcement), oil and gas industries, manufacturing (automotive, chemical, metal fabrication, food and beverage, wood working, paper and pulp), mining, construction, agriculture and forestry, cement production, power generation, shipbuilding and the textile industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/osnr0014.txt|title=Respirator use and practices|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Correct usage ==\n[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Workplace protection factor (PF)]] of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters.

The gas being denser than air flowed downwards forcing troops to climb out of their [[trenches]]. Reserve Canadian troops, who were away from the attack, used [[urine]]-soaked cloths as primitive respirators. A Canadian soldier realized that the [[ammonia]] in urine would react with the chlorine, neutralizing it, and that the water would dissolve the chlorine, allowing soldiers to breathe through the gas.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\nChina normally makes 10 million masks<!-- or [[dust mask]] or [[surgical mask]]--> per day, about half of the world production.

There are two main categories: the ''air-purifying respirator'', in which respirable air is obtained by filtering a contaminated atmosphere, and the ''air-supplied respirator'', in which an alternate supply of breathable air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants.\n\nAir-purifying respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable face masks sometimes referred to as a [[dust mask]] to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges often called a [[gas mask]].\n\n==Physical form==\n[[File:NIOSH P95 cross section.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Cross-section of [[NIOSH air filtration rating|NIOSH-approved]] P95 filters used in [[metalworking]] operations. Even \"clean\" industrial processes often generate large amounts of harmful particulate matter and require breathing protection.]]\nAll respirators have some type of facepiece held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method.  Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The differences in respirator design impact the [[respirator assigned protection factors]], i.e. the resulting degree of protection from which kind of hazard.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThere are three categories of particulate respirators: particulate-filtering facepiece respirators are discarded when they become unsuitable for further use due to considerations of hygiene, excessive resistance, or physical damage; elastomeric respirators are reusable because the facepiece is cleaned and reused, but the filter cartridges are discarded and replaced when they become unsuitable for further use; and [[Powered air-purifying respirator|powered air-purifying respirators]] have a battery-powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource1quest1.html|title=Respirator Trusted-Source Information: What are they?|last=|first=|date=2018-01-29|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nRespirators can have half-face forms that cover the bottom half of the face including the nose and mouth, and full-face forms that cover the entire face. Half-face respirators should only be worn in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is spray painting could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with [[chlorine]] gas would have to wear a full-face respirator.\n\n== Types of filtration ==\n\n=== Air-purifying ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Personal protective equipment]] -->\n[[File:Police officer wearing half-mask respirator.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Protective P100 filter mask worn by NYPD officer]]\nAir-purifying respirators are used against particulates, gases, and vapors that are at atmospheric concentrations less than immediately dangerous to life and health. This includes:\n\n*[[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative-pressure]] respirators using mechanical filters and chemical media\n*[[positive pressure|positive-pressure]] units such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)\n*Escape Only respirators or hoods such as Air-Purifying Escape Respirators for use by the general public for [[chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear]]  (CBRN) terrorism incidents.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFull hood, half- or full-facepiece designs are marketed in many varieties depending on the hazard of concern using an [[air filter]] which acts passively on air inhaled by the wearer. Two common examples of this type of respirator are single-use escape hoods and filter masks. The latter are typically simple, light, single-piece, half-face masks and employ the first three mechanical filter mechanisms in the list below to remove particulates from the air stream.  The most common of these is the disposable white N95 variety. It is discarded after single use or some extended period depending on the contaminant. Filter masks also come in replaceable-cartridge, multiple-use models. Typically one or two cartridges attach securely to a mask which has built into it a corresponding number of valves for inhalation and one for exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) and the [[International Safety Equipment Association]] (ISEA) established the American National Standard for Air-Purifying Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices to define both test criteria and approval methods for fire/smoke escape hoods. ANSI/ISEA Standard 110 provides design guidance to manufacturers of Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices (RPED) in the form of performance requirements and testing procedures. The standard covers certification, ISO registration for the manufacturer, associated test methods, labeling, conditioning requirements, independent process and quality control audits, and follow-up inspection programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://safetyequipment.org/c/std110-2009.cfm |title=International Safety Equipment Association |publisher=Safetyequipment.org |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> ANSI/ISEA 110 was prepared by members of the ISEA RPED group, in consultation with testing laboratories and was reviewed by a consensus panel representing users, health and safety professionals and government representatives.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission uses ANSI/ISEA 110 as the benchmark in their testing of fire escape masks.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Mechanical filter====\nMechanical filter respirators retain particulate matter such as dust created during [[woodwork]]ing or metal processing, when contaminated air is passed through the filter material. Wool is still used today as a filter, along with plastic, glass, cellulose, and combinations of two or more of these materials. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[File:Atemluftfilter Einwegmaske.jpg|thumb|Filtering half mask with exhalation valve (class: FFP3)]]\n\nMechanical filters remove contaminants from air in the following ways:\n\n# by ''interception'' when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it;\n# by ''impaction'', when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity\n# by an enhancing mechanism called ''diffusion'', where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100&nbsp;nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter; this effect is similar to [[Brownian motion]] and increases the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the two mechanisms above; it becomes dominant at lower air flow velocities\n# by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an [[electrostatic charge]] that holds them on the filter surface;\n# by using gravity and allowing particles to settle into the filter material (this effect is typically negligible); and\n# by using the particles themselves, after the filter has been used, to act as a filter medium for other particles.\n\t\nConsidering only particulates carried on an air stream and a fiber mesh filter, diffusion predominates below the 0.1 \u03bcm diameter particle size. Impaction and interception predominate above 0.4 \u03bcm.

The service life of the cartridge varies based, among other variables, on the carbon weight and molecular weight of the vapor and the cartridge media, the concentration of vapor in the atmosphere, the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and the breathing rate of the respirator wearer.

There are different units for different environments. The units consist of a powered [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] which forces incoming air through one or more [[filter (air)|filter]]s to the user for breathing. The fan and filters may be carried by the user or they may be remotely mounted and the user breathes the air through tubing.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe filter type must be matched to the contaminants that need to be removed. Some PAPR's are designed to remove fine particulate matter, while others are suitable for working with [[volatile organic compound]]s as those in [[spray paint]]s. These must have their filter elements replaced more often than a particulate filter.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)===\n{{Main|Self-contained breathing apparatus}}\n\nA self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) typically has three main components: a high-pressure air cylinder (e.g., 2200 psi to 4500 psi), a pressure gauge and regulator, and an inhalation connection (mouthpiece, mouth mask or full face mask), connected together and mounted to a carrying frame or a harness with adjustable shoulder straps and belt so it can be worn on the back. There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOpen-circuit industrial breathing sets are filled with filtered, compressed air. The compressed air passes through a regulator, is inhaled and exhaled out of the circuit, quickly depleting the supply of air. Air cylinders are made of aluminum, steel, or of a composite construction like fiberglass-wrapped aluminum. The \"positive pressure\" type is common, which supplies a steady stream of air to stop fumes or smoke from leaking into the mask. Other SCBA's are of the \"demand\" type, which only supply air when the regulator senses the user inhaling. All fire departments and those working in toxic environments use the positive pressure SCBA for safety reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe closed-circuit type SCBA filters, supplements, and recirculates exhaled gas like a [[rebreather]]. It is used when a longer-duration supply of breathing gas is needed, such as in mine rescue and in long tunnels, and going through passages too narrow for a large open-circuit air cylinder.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Industries using respirators==\nA wide range of industries use respirators including healthcare & pharmaceuticals, defense & public safety services (defense, firefighting & law enforcement), oil and gas industries, manufacturing (automotive, chemical, metal fabrication, food and beverage, wood working, paper and pulp), mining, construction, agriculture and forestry, cement production, power generation, shipbuilding and the textile industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/osnr0014.txt|title=Respirator use and practices|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Correct usage ==\n[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Workplace protection factor (PF)]] of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters.

Subsequent respirators were reusable but bulky and uncomfortable. In the 1970s, the Bureau of Mines and NIOSH developed standards for single-use respirators, and the first N95 respirator was developed by 3M and approved in 1972.[24]\n\n===World War I===\nThe first recorded response and defense against chemical attacks using respirators occurred during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] on the Western Front in [[World War I]]. It was the first time Germany used [[chemical weapon]]s on a large scale releasing 168 tons of [[chlorine gas]] over a four-mile (6&nbsp;km) front killing around 6,000 troops within ten minutes through [[asphyxiation]]. The gas being denser than air flowed downwards forcing troops to climb out of their [[trenches]]. Reserve Canadian troops, who were away from the attack, used [[urine]]-soaked cloths as primitive respirators. A Canadian soldier realized that the [[ammonia]] in urine would react with the chlorine, neutralizing it, and that the water would dissolve the chlorine, allowing soldiers to breathe through the gas.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\nChina normally makes 10 million masks<!-- or [[dust mask]] or [[surgical mask]]--> per day, about half of the world production.
