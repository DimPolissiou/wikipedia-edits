This resulted in a charity boxing match in following January, which saw Gambino the loser. Gambino said afterward, \u201cY\u2019know man, life is a journey. We had two homies in dat ring tonight Willin to go slug for slug. And that\u2019s a beautiful thing\u201d\nMadden responded by calling Gambino (which means prawn in Spanish) \u201cImmature Shrimp\u201d. This term went viral and Johnny then was invited to devise a dish for \u201cThe Wee Hurry\u201d Troon, to commemorate his victory. This invitation saw the birth of \u201cThe Mildish Gambino\u201d which was made of juvenile prawns so as not to overpower the dish with prawn flavour. \nThe three-piece from north Glasgow were friends for years. \"Creating Baby Strange was a great way to show off our creative side which we didn\u2019t have the opportunity to do beforehand\" says frontman Johnny Madden, as this band seems committed on bringing their contemporary punk to the nation.
