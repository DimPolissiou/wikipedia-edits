It remains the only UK-designed-and-built fighter capable of [[Mach number|Mach 2]].  The Lightning was designed, developed, and manufactured by [[English Electric]], which was later absorbed by the newly-formed [[British Aircraft Corporation]]. Later the type was marketed as the '''BAC Lightning'''.  It was operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the [[Kuwait Air Force]] (KAF) and the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (RSAF).\n\nA unique feature of the Lightning's design is the vertical, staggered configuration of its two [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines within the fuselage. The Lightning was initially designed and developed as an interceptor to defend the [[V bomber]] airfields<ref>Note: at the time, the V bombers carried Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]] and thus were the likely first-strike targets of a Soviet air attack on the UK. In addition to the Lightning, last line-of-defence for the airfields was to be what became the [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bristol Bloodhound]] guided missile.</ref> from attack by anticipated future nuclear-armed supersonic Soviet bombers such as what emerged as the [[Tupolev Tu-22]], but it was subsequently also required to intercept other [[bomber]] aircraft such as the [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-95]]. The Lightning has exceptional [[rate of climb]], [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]], and speed; pilots have described flying it as \"being saddled to a skyrocket\".<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> This performance and the initially limited fuel supply<ref>Note: the original specification only called for a 150-mile radius of action from the V bomber bases the aircraft was defending. [[Roland Beamont]] later called for the Lightning's fuel capacity to be greatly increased, which it was.</ref> made the Lightning a \"fuel-critical\" aircraft, meaning that its missions are dictated to a high degree by its limited range. Later developments provided greater range and speed along with [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground-attack]] capability.\n\nFollowing retirement by the RAF in the late 1980s, many of the remaining aircraft became museum exhibits. Until 2009, three Lightnings were kept flying at \"[[Thunder City]]\" in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. In September 2008, the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] conferred on the Lightning its \"Engineering Heritage Award\" at a ceremony at [[BAE Systems]]' site at [[Warton Aerodrome]].<ref>Robinson, Ben.

Petter|W.E.W. \"Teddy\" Petter]], formerly chief designer at [[Westland Aircraft]], was a keen early proponent of Britain's need to develop a supersonic fighter aircraft. In 1947, Petter approached the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) with his proposal, and in response Specification ER.103 was issued for a single research aircraft, which was to be capable of flight at {{convert|1.5|Mach|50,000|km/h|0}} and {{cvt|50000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nPetter initiated a design proposal with [[Frederick Page|F W \"Freddie\" Page]] leading the design and [[Ray Creasey]] responsible for the aerodynamics.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40\u00b0 swept wing {{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=102}} This proposal was submitted in the November {{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=218}} and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=58}} On 29 March 1949 MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=219}}{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60\u00b0 with the ailerons moved to the wingtips.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} Following the resignation of Petter, Page took over as design team leader for the P.1.<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\">Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310.</ref> In 1949, the Ministry of Supply had issued Specification F23/49, which expanded upon the scope of ER103 to include fighter-level manoeuvring. On 1 April 1950, English Electric received a contract for two flying [[airframe]]s, as well as one static airframe, designated ''P.1.''<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\" />\n\nThe [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] was sceptical of Petter's swept wing concepts. To test the design of both the wing, the tailplane and to assess handling, [[Short Brothers]] were issued a contract to produce the [[Short SB5]] in mid-1950.<ref group=\"nb\">The SB5 was allocated serial number WG768 on 27 July 1950.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Air-Britain Aeromilitaria|volume=37|issue=145|title=Post-1950 Aircraft Specifications|author=Phil Butler|publisher=[[Air-Britain]]|pages=24\u201325|issn=0262-8791 }}</ref> This was a low-speed research aircraft and was designed so that different wing sweep angles could be assumed by the single aircraft. An assortment of tailplanes and wings were supplied and could be installed in order for their flight performance to be evaluated. However, following the first flight of the SB.5 on 2 December 1952, the trials demonstrated the choice of a tailplane and a 60-degree wingsweep and proved the design principles to be effective.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:English Electric P.1 (27898298121).jpg|thumb|P1A]]\nFrom 1953 onwards, the first three prototype aircraft were hand-built at [[Samlesbury]]. These aircraft had been assigned the [[United Kingdom military aircraft serial numbers|aircraft serials]] ''WG760'', ''WG763'', and ''WG765'' (the static airframe){{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The prototypes were powered by un-[[Afterburner|reheated]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]] turbojets, as the selected [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engines which powered subsequent production aircraft had fallen behind schedule due to their own development problems.<ref>Darling 2000, p. 10.</ref> Due to the limited internal space of the fuselage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited [[combat endurance|endurance]], and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings rapidly wore out.<ref name=\"Scott 2000_13\">Scott 2000, p. 13.</ref> Outwardly, the prototypes looked very much like the production series, but they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular intakes, short fins and lack of operational equipment.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" />\n\nOn 9 June 1952, it was decided that there would be a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft towards achieving {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}}; these were designated ''P.1B'' while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as ''P.1A''.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> P.1B was a significant improvement on P.1A.

The [[Ferranti]] [[AI.23]] onboard radar provided [[missile guidance]] and ranging, as well as search and track functions.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.1\" />\n\nThe next two Lightning variants, the ''Lightning F.1A'' and ''F.2'', were steady but relatively minor refinements of the design; the next variant, the ''Lightning F.3'', was a major departure. The F.3 had higher thrust Rolls-Royce Avon 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened inlet cone allowing a service clearance to {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}} (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to {{convert|1.7|Mach|km/h|0}}).<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.3\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.3''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, April 1965.</ref> The A.I.23B radar and [[Red Top missile]] offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the ''Lightning F.6'', was already in development, but there was a need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3's shortcomings, the ''F.3A''.\n\n[[File:English Electric Lightning F3, UK - Air Force AN1127832.jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.3 in flight, 1983]]\nThe F.3A introduced two improvements: a new, non-jettisonable, {{convert|610|impgal|L|adj=on}} ventral fuel tank,<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.6''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, September 1966.</ref> and a new, kinked, conically cambered wing leading edge, incorporating a slightly larger [[leading edge]] fuel tank, raising the total usable internal fuel by {{convert|716|impgal|L}}. The conically cambered wing improved manoeuvrability, especially at higher altitudes, and the ventral tank nearly doubled available fuel. The increased fuel was welcome, but the lack of cannon armament was felt to be a deficiency. It was thought that cannons were desirable to fire warning shots in the intercept mission.<ref>Williams and Gustin 2004, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe ''Lightning F.6'' was the ultimate Lightning version to see British service. Originally it was nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two {{convert|260|impgal|L|adj=on}} [[ferry tank]]s on [[Hardpoint|pylons]] over the wings. These tanks were jettisonable in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified in the form of a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannons mounted in the front. The addition of the cannons and their ammunition decreased the tank's fuel capacity from {{convert|610|to|535|impgal|L}}, but the cannon made the F.6 a \"real fighter\" again.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\" />\n\nThe final British Lightning was the ''Lightning F.2A''. This was an F.2 upgraded with the cambered wing, the squared fin, and the {{convert|610|impgal|L}} ventral tank. The F.2A retained the A.I.23 and Firestreak missile, the nose cannon, and the earlier Avon 211R engines.<ref name= \"Aircrew Manual, F.2A\">''Lightning F.Mk.2A Aircrew Manual''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, July 1968.</ref> Although the F.2A lacked the thrust of the later Lightnings, it had the longest tactical range of all Lightning variants, and was used for low-altitude interception over [[West Germany]].\n\n===Export and further developments===\nThe ''Lightning F.53'', otherwise known as the ''Export Lightning'', developed as a private venture by BAC. While the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version was to have a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties.<ref name=\"flight68 p371\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 371.</ref> The F.53 was based on the F.6 airframe and avionics, including the large ventral fuel tank, cambered wing and overwing pylons for drop tanks of the F.6, but incorporated an additional pair of hardpoints under the outer wing. These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for [[air-to-ground weaponry]], including two {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} bombs or four [[SNEB]] rocket pods each carrying 18 68&nbsp;mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank.<ref name=\"flight68 p372-3\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373.</ref>{{refn|The ventral cannon installation was designed for the export aircraft but was later adopted by the RAF for the F.6 and F.2A.<ref name=\"WoF7 p57\">Lake 1997, p. 57.</ref>|group=nb}} Alternative, interchangeable packs in the forward fuselage carried two Firestreak missiles, two Red Top missiles, twin retractable launchers for 44\u00d7 {{convert|2|inch|adj=on|sigfig=1}} rockets, or a [[reconnaissance pod]] fitted with five 70&nbsp;mm Type 360 Vinten cameras.<ref name=\"flight68 p373\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 373.</ref>\n\nBAC also proposed clearing the overwing hardpoints for carriage of weapons as well as [[drop tank]]s, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB {{convert|68|mm|abbr=on|lk=on}} rockets and {{convert|227|L|impgal|lk=on|order=flip}} of fuel) or {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs or 44 \u00d7 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} rockets and 144 \u00d7 68&nbsp;mm rockets.<ref name=\"combatp67\">Gunston and Spick 1983, p. 67.</ref><ref name=\"flight68 p372-3,6\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373, 376.</ref> The ''Lightning T.55'' was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6.<ref name=\"WoF7 p56-7\" /> The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF's own Lightnings such as exceptional climb rate and agile manoeuvering. The Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009\">McLelland 2009, {{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, BAC Warton was working on the preliminary design of a two-seat Lightning development with a [[variable-geometry wing]], based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the [[variable-sweep wing]], which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the [[Royal Navy]]'s existing [[aircraft carriers]] [[carrier-based aircraft]], the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year.<ref name= \"Wood 1986\">Wood 1986, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] engine. It is likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.<ref name =\"buttler 114-117\" />\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\nThe Lightning had several distinctive design features, the primary being the twin-engine arrangement, notched [[delta wing]], and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimising frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin-engine installations.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201766.html |title=Multi-mission Lightning |work=Flight International |page=372 |date=5 September 1960}}</ref> The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with inlet cone), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. Because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200542.html|title=air marshal \u2013 wg \u2013 ib \u2013 1957 \u2013 0542 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201770.html|title=1968 \u2013 1770 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref> although this was rarely done operationally because there would be no hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed .<ref name=\"flightglobal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200231.html|title=lightning \u2013 english electric \u2013 1961 \u2013 0231 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EE Lightning F6 XS904 BQ (7173122840).jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.6 XS904 after a high-speed taxi run at 2012 Cold War Jets Day, Bruntingthorpe]]\n\nProduction aircraft were powered by various models of the Avon engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating {{convert|11250|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage afterburner this increased to a maximum thrust of {{convert|14430|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}. Later models of the Avon featured, in addition to increased thrust, a full-variable reheat arrangement.<ref>Darling 2008, pp. 32, 66.</ref> A special heat-reflecting paint containing gold was used to protect the aircraft's structure from the hot engine casing which could reach temperatures of 600&nbsp;\u00b0C.

The Lightning's optimum climb profile required the use of afterburners during takeoff. Immediately after takeoff, the nose would be lowered for rapid acceleration to {{convert|430|kn|km/h}} [[Indicated airspeed|IAS]] before initiating a climb, stabilising at {{convert|450|kn|km/h}}.

The inlet's central shock cone served as a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip. Known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable, but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned just forward of the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock became supercritical, and supersonic airflow entered the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in [[engine surge|surges]] or [[compressor stall]]s, these could cause [[flameout]]s or damage.\n\nThermal and structural limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by the passage of an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone at the front of the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would have interfered with the AI 23's radar emissions. The shock cone was eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At {{convert|36000|ft}} and {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}}, the heating conditions on the shock cone was similar to those at sea level and {{convert|650|kn|km/h}} indicated airspeed,<ref group=\"nb\">On a standard day, the temperature of the air at the tip of the shock cone (stagnation temperature) was {{convert|156|\u00b0F}} at {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|36000|ft}}.

The shock cone was strengthened on the later Lightning F.2A, F.3, F.6, and F.53 models, thus allowing routine operations at up to Mach 2.0.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009_50\">McLelland 2009, p. 50.</ref>\n\nThe small-fin variants could exceed Mach 1.7,{{refn|Roland Beamont took the Lightning P.1B XA847, a prototype of the F.1, to Mach 2.0. Prior testing had determined that the aircraft had the excess thrust to achieve this speed, given the right atmospheric conditions of a high tropopause and lower-than-standard temperature. The test flight was to check for inlet stability and monitor temperatures at higher Mach. The aircraft was equipped with a temperature probe to monitor the stagnation temperature, up to a never-exceed temperature of 115&nbsp;\u00b0C. On 28 November 1958, the weather availed a high tropopause and a substandard \u221267&nbsp;\u00b0C at {{convert|40000|ft}}.

It remains the only UK-designed-and-built fighter capable of [[Mach number|Mach 2]].  The Lightning was designed, developed, and manufactured by [[English Electric]], which was later absorbed by the newly-formed [[British Aircraft Corporation]]. Later the type was marketed as the '''BAC Lightning'''.  It was operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the [[Kuwait Air Force]] (KAF) and the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (RSAF).\n\nA unique feature of the Lightning's design is the vertical, staggered configuration of its two [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines within the fuselage. The Lightning was initially designed and developed as an interceptor to defend the [[V bomber]] airfields<ref>Note: at the time, the V bombers carried Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]] and thus were the likely first-strike targets of a Soviet air attack on the UK. In addition to the Lightning, last line-of-defence for the airfields was to be what became the [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bristol Bloodhound]] guided missile.</ref> from attack by anticipated future nuclear-armed supersonic Soviet bombers such as what emerged as the [[Tupolev Tu-22]], but it was subsequently also required to intercept other [[bomber]] aircraft such as the [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-95]]. The Lightning has exceptional [[rate of climb]], [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]], and speed; pilots have described flying it as \"being saddled to a skyrocket\".<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> This performance and the initially limited fuel supply<ref>Note: the original specification only called for a 150-mile radius of action from the V bomber bases the aircraft was defending. [[Roland Beamont]] later called for the Lightning's fuel capacity to be greatly increased, which it was.</ref> made the Lightning a \"fuel-critical\" aircraft, meaning that its missions are dictated to a high degree by its limited range. Later developments provided greater range and speed along with [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground-attack]] capability.\n\nFollowing retirement by the RAF in the late 1980s, many of the remaining aircraft became museum exhibits. Until 2009, three Lightnings were kept flying at \"[[Thunder City]]\" in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.

Petter|W.E.W. \"Teddy\" Petter]], formerly chief designer at [[Westland Aircraft]], was a keen early proponent of Britain's need to develop a supersonic fighter aircraft. In 1947, Petter approached the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) with his proposal, and in response Specification ER.103 was issued for a single research aircraft, which was to be capable of flight at {{convert|1.5|Mach|50,000|km/h|0}} and {{cvt|50000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nPetter initiated a design proposal with [[Frederick Page|F W \"Freddie\" Page]] leading the design and [[Ray Creasey]] responsible for the aerodynamics.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40\u00b0 swept wing {{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=102}} This proposal was submitted in the November {{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=218}} and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=58}} On 29 March 1949 MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=219}}{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60\u00b0 with the ailerons moved to the wingtips.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} Following the resignation of Petter, Page took over as design team leader for the P.1.<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\">Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310.</ref> In 1949, the Ministry of Supply had issued Specification F23/49, which expanded upon the scope of ER103 to include fighter-level manoeuvring. On 1 April 1950, English Electric received a contract for two flying [[airframe]]s, as well as one static airframe, designated ''P.1.''<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\" />\n\nThe [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] was sceptical of Petter's swept wing concepts. To test the design of both the wing, the tailplane and to assess handling, [[Short Brothers]] were issued a contract to produce the [[Short SB5]] in mid-1950.<ref group=\"nb\">The SB5 was allocated serial number WG768 on 27 July 1950.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Air-Britain Aeromilitaria|volume=37|issue=145|title=Post-1950 Aircraft Specifications|author=Phil Butler|publisher=[[Air-Britain]]|pages=24\u201325|issn=0262-8791 }}</ref> This was a low-speed research aircraft and was designed so that different wing sweep angles could be assumed by the single aircraft. An assortment of tailplanes and wings were supplied and could be installed in order for their flight performance to be evaluated. However, following the first flight of the SB.5 on 2 December 1952, the trials demonstrated the choice of a tailplane and a 60-degree wingsweep and proved the design principles to be effective.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:English Electric P.1 (27898298121).jpg|thumb|P1A]]\nFrom 1953 onwards, the first three prototype aircraft were hand-built at [[Samlesbury]]. These aircraft had been assigned the [[United Kingdom military aircraft serial numbers|aircraft serials]] ''WG760'', ''WG763'', and ''WG765'' (the static airframe){{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The prototypes were powered by un-[[Afterburner|reheated]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]] turbojets, as the selected [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engines which powered subsequent production aircraft had fallen behind schedule due to their own development problems.<ref>Darling 2000, p. 10.</ref> Due to the limited internal space of the fuselage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited [[combat endurance|endurance]], and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings rapidly wore out.<ref name=\"Scott 2000_13\">Scott 2000, p. 13.</ref> Outwardly, the prototypes looked very much like the production series, but they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular intakes, short fins and lack of operational equipment.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" />\n\nOn 9 June 1952, it was decided that there would be a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft towards achieving {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}}; these were designated ''P.1B'' while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as ''P.1A''.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> P.1B was a significant improvement on P.1A. While it was similar in aerodynamics, structure and control systems, it incorporated extensive alterations to the forward fuselage, reheated Rolls Royce Avon R24R engines, a conical centre body [[inlet cone]], variable nozzle reheat and provision for weapons systems integrated with the [[air data computer|ADC]] and [[Airborne interception radar#AI#|AI.23 radar]].{{sfnp|Beamont|1984|p=51-52}}<ref name =\"buttler 65\" /> Three P1B prototypes were built, assigned serials XA847, XA853 and XA856<ref name=\"Beamont 123\">Beamont 1985 p.123</ref>\n\nIn May 1954, ''WG760'' and its support equipment were moved to [[RAF Boscombe Down]] for pre-flight ground taxi trials; on the morning of 4 August 1954, ''WG760'', piloted by [[Roland Beamont]], flew for the first time from Boscombe Down.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> One week later, ''WG760'' officially achieved [[supersonic]] flight for the first time, having exceeded the [[speed of sound]] during its third flight.<ref name =\"buttler 65\">Buttler 2000, p. 65.</ref> During its first flight, ''WG760'' had unknowingly exceeded {{convert|1|Mach|km/h|0}}, but due to [[position error]] the [[Machmeter|Mach meter]] only showed a maximum of {{convert|0.95|Mach|km/h|0}}. The occurrence was noticed during flight data analysis a few days later.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200541.html \"Progress with the P.1\"] ''Flight'', 26 April 1957, p.&nbsp;543.</ref> While ''WG760'' had proven the P.1 design to be viable, it was limited to {{convert|1.51|Mach|km/h|0}} due to [[directional stability]] limits. In May 1956, the P.1 received the \"Lightning\" name, which was said to have been partially selected to reflect the aircraft's supersonic capabilities.<ref name =\"buttler 66\">Buttler 2000, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 4 April 1957 Beamont made the first flight of the P.1B (XA847) exceeding Mach 1 during this flight.{{sfnp|Flight|26 April 1957}}{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=56-57}} On 25 November he reached Mach 2, {{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=67}} the first time in a British aircraft.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> During the early flight trials of the P.1B speeds in excess of 1,000&nbsp;mph were achieved daily. During this period the [[Fairey FD2]] delta held the world speed record (1,132&nbsp;mph achieved on 10 March 1956 and held till December 1957). While the P.1B was potentially faster than the FD2, it lacked the fuel capacity to provide one run in each direction at maximum speed to claim the record in accordance with international rules.{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=59}}\n\nIn 1958 two test pilots from the USAF [[Air Force Flight Test Center]], Andy Anderson and [[Deke Slayton]], were given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the P1B. Slayton, who was subsequently selected as one of the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] astronauts, commented:\n\n{{quote|The P.1 was a terrific plane, with the easy handling of the F-86 and the performance of an F-104. Its only drawback was that it had no range at all. . . Looking back, however, I'd have to say that the P.1 was my favourite all-time plane.<ref>{{cite publication |title=Deke!

To best perform this intercept mission, emphasis was placed on rate-of-climb, acceleration, and speed, rather than [[range (aeronautics)|range]] \u2013 originally a radius of operation of {{convert|150|mi}} from the V bomber airfields was specified \u2013 and combat endurance. It was equipped with two 30&nbsp;mm ADEN cannon in front of the cockpit windscreen and an interchangeable fuselage weapons pack containing either an additional two ADEN cannon, 48 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|spell=in}} unguided air-to-air rockets, or two [[de Havilland Firestreak]] [[air-to-air missile]]s;<ref name=\"Scott 2000_119\">Scott 2000, pp. 119\u2013129.</ref> a heavy loadout optimised for damaging large aircraft. The [[Ferranti]] [[AI.23]] onboard radar provided [[missile guidance]] and ranging, as well as search and track functions.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.1\" />\n\nThe next two Lightning variants, the ''Lightning F.1A'' and ''F.2'', were steady but relatively minor refinements of the design; the next variant, the ''Lightning F.3'', was a major departure. The F.3 had higher thrust Rolls-Royce Avon 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened inlet cone allowing a service clearance to {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}} (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to {{convert|1.7|Mach|km/h|0}}).<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.3\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.3''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, April 1965.</ref> The A.I.23B radar and [[Red Top missile]] offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the ''Lightning F.6'', was already in development, but there was a need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3's shortcomings, the ''F.3A''.\n\n[[File:English Electric Lightning F3, UK - Air Force AN1127832.jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.3 in flight, 1983]]\nThe F.3A introduced two improvements: a new, non-jettisonable, {{convert|610|impgal|L|adj=on}} ventral fuel tank,<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.6''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, September 1966.</ref> and a new, kinked, conically cambered wing leading edge, incorporating a slightly larger [[leading edge]] fuel tank, raising the total usable internal fuel by {{convert|716|impgal|L}}. The conically cambered wing improved manoeuvrability, especially at higher altitudes, and the ventral tank nearly doubled available fuel. The increased fuel was welcome, but the lack of cannon armament was felt to be a deficiency. It was thought that cannons were desirable to fire warning shots in the intercept mission.<ref>Williams and Gustin 2004, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe ''Lightning F.6'' was the ultimate Lightning version to see British service. Originally it was nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two {{convert|260|impgal|L|adj=on}} [[ferry tank]]s on [[Hardpoint|pylons]] over the wings. These tanks were jettisonable in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified in the form of a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannons mounted in the front. The addition of the cannons and their ammunition decreased the tank's fuel capacity from {{convert|610|to|535|impgal|L}}, but the cannon made the F.6 a \"real fighter\" again.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\" />\n\nThe final British Lightning was the ''Lightning F.2A''. This was an F.2 upgraded with the cambered wing, the squared fin, and the {{convert|610|impgal|L}} ventral tank. The F.2A retained the A.I.23 and Firestreak missile, the nose cannon, and the earlier Avon 211R engines.<ref name= \"Aircrew Manual, F.2A\">''Lightning F.Mk.2A Aircrew Manual''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, July 1968.</ref> Although the F.2A lacked the thrust of the later Lightnings, it had the longest tactical range of all Lightning variants, and was used for low-altitude interception over [[West Germany]].\n\n===Export and further developments===\nThe ''Lightning F.53'', otherwise known as the ''Export Lightning'', developed as a private venture by BAC. While the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version was to have a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties.<ref name=\"flight68 p371\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 371.</ref> The F.53 was based on the F.6 airframe and avionics, including the large ventral fuel tank, cambered wing and overwing pylons for drop tanks of the F.6, but incorporated an additional pair of hardpoints under the outer wing. These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for [[air-to-ground weaponry]], including two {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} bombs or four [[SNEB]] rocket pods each carrying 18 68&nbsp;mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank.<ref name=\"flight68 p372-3\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373.</ref>{{refn|The ventral cannon installation was designed for the export aircraft but was later adopted by the RAF for the F.6 and F.2A.<ref name=\"WoF7 p57\">Lake 1997, p. 57.</ref>|group=nb}} Alternative, interchangeable packs in the forward fuselage carried two Firestreak missiles, two Red Top missiles, twin retractable launchers for 44\u00d7 {{convert|2|inch|adj=on|sigfig=1}} rockets, or a [[reconnaissance pod]] fitted with five 70&nbsp;mm Type 360 Vinten cameras.<ref name=\"flight68 p373\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 373.</ref>\n\nBAC also proposed clearing the overwing hardpoints for carriage of weapons as well as [[drop tank]]s, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB {{convert|68|mm|abbr=on|lk=on}} rockets and {{convert|227|L|impgal|lk=on|order=flip}} of fuel) or {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs or 44 \u00d7 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} rockets and 144 \u00d7 68&nbsp;mm rockets.<ref name=\"combatp67\">Gunston and Spick 1983, p. 67.</ref><ref name=\"flight68 p372-3,6\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373, 376.</ref> The ''Lightning T.55'' was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6.<ref name=\"WoF7 p56-7\" /> The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF's own Lightnings such as exceptional climb rate and agile manoeuvering. The Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009\">McLelland 2009, {{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, BAC Warton was working on the preliminary design of a two-seat Lightning development with a [[variable-geometry wing]], based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the [[variable-sweep wing]], which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the [[Royal Navy]]'s existing [[aircraft carriers]] [[carrier-based aircraft]], the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year.<ref name= \"Wood 1986\">Wood 1986, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] engine. It is likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.<ref name =\"buttler 114-117\" />\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\nThe Lightning had several distinctive design features, the primary being the twin-engine arrangement, notched [[delta wing]], and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimising frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin-engine installations.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201766.html |title=Multi-mission Lightning |work=Flight International |page=372 |date=5 September 1960}}</ref> The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with inlet cone), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. Because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200542.html|title=air marshal \u2013 wg \u2013 ib \u2013 1957 \u2013 0542 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201770.html|title=1968 \u2013 1770 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref> although this was rarely done operationally because there would be no hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed .<ref name=\"flightglobal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200231.html|title=lightning \u2013 english electric \u2013 1961 \u2013 0231 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EE Lightning F6 XS904 BQ (7173122840).jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.6 XS904 after a high-speed taxi run at 2012 Cold War Jets Day, Bruntingthorpe]]\n\nProduction aircraft were powered by various models of the Avon engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating {{convert|11250|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage afterburner this increased to a maximum thrust of {{convert|14430|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}. Later models of the Avon featured, in addition to increased thrust, a full-variable reheat arrangement.<ref>Darling 2008, pp. 32, 66.</ref> A special heat-reflecting paint containing gold was used to protect the aircraft's structure from the hot engine casing which could reach temperatures of 600&nbsp;\u00b0C. Under optimum conditions, a well-equipped maintenance facility took four hours to perform an engine change so specialised ground test rigs were developed to speed up maintenance and remove the need to perform a full ground run of the engine after some maintenance tasks.<ref>Darling 2008, pp. 32\u201333.</ref> The stacked engine configuration complicated maintenance work, and the leakage of fluid from the upper engine was a recurring [[fire hazard]].<ref name=\"Scott 2000_98\">Scott 2000, pp. 98\u201399.</ref> The fire risk was reduced, but not eliminated, following remedial work during development.<ref>Darling 2008, pp. 25\u201326.</ref> For removal, the lower No.1 engine was removed from below the aircraft, after removal of the ventral tank and lower fuselage access panels, by lowering the engine down, while the upper No.2 engine was lifted out from above via removable sections in the fuselage top.\n\nThe fuselage was tightly packed, leaving no room for fuel tankage or main landing gear. While the notched delta wing lacked the volume of a standard delta wing, each wing contained a fairly conventional three-section main fuel tank and leading-edge tank, holding {{convert|312|impgal|L|abbr=on}};<ref group=\"nb\">All fuel tank volumes are listed in Imperial gallons</ref> the wing flaps also each contained a {{convert|33|impgal|L|abbr=on}} fuel tank and an additional {{convert|5|impgal|L|abbr=on}} was contained in a [[Recuperator|fuel recuperator]], bringing the aircraft's total internal fuel capacity to {{convert|700|impgal|L|abbr=on}}. The main landing gear was sandwiched outboard of the main tanks and aft of the leading edge tanks, with the flap fuel tanks behind.<ref name=\"Pilot's Notes, F.1\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F Mk.1 and F Mk.1A''.

The rocket engine was intended at an early stage in the Lightning's development to boost performance should non-afterburning (reheated) engines be fitted.

It was famous for its ability to rapidly rotate from takeoff to climb almost vertically from the runway, though this did not yield the best time-to-altitude. The Lightning's trademark tail-stand manoeuvre exchanged airspeed for altitude; it could slow to near-stall speeds before commencing level flight. The Lightning's optimum climb profile required the use of afterburners during takeoff. Immediately after takeoff, the nose would be lowered for rapid acceleration to {{convert|430|kn|km/h}} [[Indicated airspeed|IAS]] before initiating a climb, stabilising at {{convert|450|kn|km/h}}. This would yield a constant climb rate of approximately {{convert|20000|ft/min|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name= \"F.6 ODM\" /><ref group=\"nb\">The Lightning would increase forward velocity during the climb, the angle of the climb lessening from about 27 deg to 19 deg at {{convert|13000|ft|abbr=on}}.</ref> Around {{convert|13000|ft|abbr=on}} the Lightning would reach {{convert|0.87|Mach|13000|km/h|0}} and maintain this speed until reaching the [[tropopause]], {{convert|36000|ft|abbr=on}} on a standard day.{{refn|The true airspeed associated with a given indicated airspeed increases with altitude.

The inlet's central shock cone served as a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip. Known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable, but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned just forward of the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock became supercritical, and supersonic airflow entered the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in [[engine surge|surges]] or [[compressor stall]]s, these could cause [[flameout]]s or damage.\n\nThermal and structural limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by the passage of an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone at the front of the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would have interfered with the AI 23's radar emissions. The shock cone was eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At {{convert|36000|ft}} and {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}}, the heating conditions on the shock cone was similar to those at sea level and {{convert|650|kn|km/h}} indicated airspeed,<ref group=\"nb\">On a standard day, the temperature of the air at the tip of the shock cone (stagnation temperature) was {{convert|156|\u00b0F}} at {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|36000|ft}}.

The shock cone was strengthened on the later Lightning F.2A, F.3, F.6, and F.53 models, thus allowing routine operations at up to Mach 2.0.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009_50\">McLelland 2009, p. 50.</ref>\n\nThe small-fin variants could exceed Mach 1.7,{{refn|Roland Beamont took the Lightning P.1B XA847, a prototype of the F.1, to Mach 2.0. Prior testing had determined that the aircraft had the excess thrust to achieve this speed, given the right atmospheric conditions of a high tropopause and lower-than-standard temperature. The test flight was to check for inlet stability and monitor temperatures at higher Mach. The aircraft was equipped with a temperature probe to monitor the stagnation temperature, up to a never-exceed temperature of 115&nbsp;\u00b0C. On 28 November 1958, the weather availed a high tropopause and a substandard \u221267&nbsp;\u00b0C at {{convert|40000|ft}}.

The building is approximately 300 meters long.  Feature - negative angle of the end facades due to the removal of the console on 25 m. Facades - glass, with a total area of more than 60 thousand m2.<ref>[https://habr.com/ru/company/lakhtacenter/blog/371535/ Horizontal versus vertical. Or for? Why Lakhta Center \"recumbent\" dominant]</ref>\n\nConstructive scheme of the building - frame. More than 24 thousand tons of metal structures were used for the construction of this facility.\n\nThe main load-bearing elements are 4 reinforced concrete cores which perceive horizontal and vertical loadings, transferring them to the base executed in the form of the plate grillage leaning against piles. Between the Southern and Northern buildings of the MFZ along the entire height of the atrium, with a roof of translucent polymer membranes ETFE. In the space of the atrium, transitional bridges are spanned, which serve as observation points. Atrium is a pedestrian area from which you can get to any of the objects of the building.\n\nThe MFZ will house a number of public spaces - for example, a planetarium in the shape of a ball or a seven-storey hall-transformer, which can take different configurations: from the classical parquet to the amphitheater.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Facilities ===\nLakhta Center will contain offices, a [[co-working]] center, a sports center, a children's science center, and a conference center. The project includes 1,500 square meters of indoor exhibition space. Part of the open area will be used to demonstrate art, installations and sculptures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.proektvlahte.ru/ru/press/gallery/presentation/?id=445|title=\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b {{!}} \u041b\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0430 \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u2013 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0432 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430|website=www.proektvlahte.ru|access-date=2018-07-30}}</ref> There will be a free public observation deck at the top of the skyscraper at a height of 357 meters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.proektvlahte.ru/en/about/objects/viewpoint/|title=Observation deck {{!}} \u041b\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0430 \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u2013 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0432 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430|website=www.proektvlahte.ru|access-date=2018-07-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fontanka.ru/2014/08/19/122/|script-title=ru:\u0421\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0443 \u041b\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0430-\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u0446\u0438\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0430\u043c\u0438|date=2014-08-19|accessdate=2018-07-30|language=ru}}</ref> A Planetarium, which includes a 19-meter sparkling ball on the surface of which are 1223 curved triangular stainless steel sheets, polished to a shine.
