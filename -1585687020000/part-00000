Keeping in tradition with GE's locomotive series nicknames beginning with the \"Dash 7\" of the 1970s, the C44-9W was dubbed the '''Dash 9''' upon its debut in 1993.\n\nPart of GE's [[GE Dash 9 Series|\"Dash 9\" series]] of locomotives, the Dash 9-44CW shares its frame, HiAd trucks, 16-cylinder 7FDL engine, and 752AH-31 traction motors with the [[GE Dash 9-40CW]]. But while the more common 9-44CW offers 4,400 horsepower (3,300&nbsp;kW), software in the 9-40CW's engine-governing unit restricts its power output to 4,000 horsepower (3,000&nbsp;kW).\n\nThe design has since proven popular with [[North America]]n railroads, although some railroads, such as [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific]], preferred its AC equivalent, the [[GE AC4400CW|AC4400CW]]. Because of more stringent emissions requirements that came into effect in the [[United States]] on January 1, 2005, the Dash 9-44CW has been replaced in production by the [[GE ES44DC]].\n\nMany North American railroads have ordered the C44-9W. They were originally ordered by [[Chicago & North Western Railway]], [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]], [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]], [[CSX Transportation|CSX]], [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]], [[Canadian National Railway]], [[BC Rail]], and [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] purchased the very similar [[GE Dash 9-40CW|Dash 9-40CW]]s.\n\nBNSF Dash 9 #4723 is featured as a drivable locomotive in ''[[Microsoft Train Simulator]]'' and the actual Dash 9 has stickers on its cab noting this, and Dash 9s are also featured as drivable locomotives in ''[[RailWorks 3]]'' and ''Trainz Simulator''.\n\n==Rebuilds==\nThe BNSF '''AC44C4M''' is a GE C44-9W rebuilt with [[alternating current|AC]] traction motors and an [[A1A-A1A]] wheel arrangement. The internal controls are similar to those of the newer [[GE Evolution Series#ES44C4|GE ES44C4]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2015/09/09-bnsf-overhaul | title=BNSF receives first rebuilt locomotives from GE, EMD | work=[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]] | date=9 September 2015 | accessdate=10 September 2015}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Only some ex-[[Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] units were rebuilt, as the rebuild program was suspended before any others could undergo rebuilding.\n\nNorfolk Southern has also converted many of their Dash 9-44CW units to A.C.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nsdash9.com/rosters/8889.html | title=GE Dash 9-44CW (D9-44CW) Nos. 8889-9978 |  date=27 September 2015 | accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref> As of November 2015, the rebuild have been officially classified as an '''[[GE AC44C6M|AC44C6M]]'''.

Keeping in tradition with GE's locomotive series nicknames beginning with the \"Dash 7\" of the 1970s, the C44-9W was dubbed the '''Dash 9''' upon its debut in 1993.\n\nPart of GE's [[GE Dash 9 Series|\"Dash 9\" series]] of locomotives, the Dash 9-44CW shares its frame, HiAd trucks, 16-cylinder 7FDL engine, and 752AH-31 traction motors with the [[GE Dash 9-40CW]]. But while the more common 9-44CW offers 4,400 horsepower (3,300&nbsp;kW), software in the 9-40CW's engine-governing unit restricts its power output to 4,000 horsepower (3,000&nbsp;kW).\n\nThe design has since proven popular with [[North America]]n railroads, although some railroads, such as [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific]], preferred its AC equivalent, the [[GE AC4400CW|AC4400CW]]. Because of more stringent emissions requirements that came into effect in the [[United States]] on January 1, 2005, the Dash 9-44CW has been replaced in production by the [[GE ES44DC]].\n\nMany North American railroads have ordered the C44-9W. They were originally ordered by [[Chicago & North Western Railway]], [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]], [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]], [[CSX Transportation|CSX]], [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]], [[Canadian National Railway]], [[BC Rail]], and [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] purchased the very similar [[GE Dash 9-40CW|Dash 9-40CW]]s.\n\nBNSF Dash 9 #4723 is featured as a drivable locomotive in ''[[Microsoft Train Simulator]]'' and the actual Dash 9 has stickers on its cab noting this, and Dash 9s are also featured as drivable locomotives in ''[[RailWorks 3]]'' and ''Trainz Simulator''.\n\n==Rebuilds==\nThe BNSF '''AC44C4M''' is a GE C44-9W rebuilt with [[alternating current|AC]] traction motors and an [[A1A-A1A]] wheel arrangement. The internal controls are similar to those of the newer [[GE Evolution Series#ES44C4|GE ES44C4]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2015/09/09-bnsf-overhaul | title=BNSF receives first rebuilt locomotives from GE, EMD | work=[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]] | date=9 September 2015 | accessdate=10 September 2015}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Only some ex-[[Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] units were rebuilt, as the rebuild program was suspended before any others could undergo rebuilding.\n\nNorfolk Southern also is experimenting with converting their Dash 9-44CW units to A.C. the first unit, (8900) is still being tested.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nsdash9.com/rosters/8889.html | title=GE Dash 9-44CW (D9-44CW) Nos. 8889-9978 |  date=27 September 2015 | accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref> As of November 2015, the rebuild have been officially classified as an '''[[GE AC44C6M|AC44C6M]]'''.\n\nNorfolk Southern has also converted Dash 9-44CW number 8946 into an AC44C6CF, numbered 8520.\n\n==Original owners==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! bgcolor=c0c090 | Railroad\n! bgcolor=c0c090 | Quantity\n! bgcolor=c0c090 | Road numbers\n! bgcolor=c0c090 | Notes\n|-\n|[[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]]\n|100\n|600\u2013699\n|All now in service with the [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]]. 666 renumbered to 599. 599\u2013619 rebuilt to [[AC44C4M]].\n|-\n|[[BC Rail]]\n|14\n|4641\u20134654\n|4641\u20134644 are model C44-9WL\n|-\n|[[BNSF Railway]]\n|1697\n|700\u2013799, 960\u20131123, 4000\u20134199, 4300\u20135532\n|5530\u20135532 were originally warranty protection units 5841\u20135843; Units 1110, 4372, 4385, 4482, 4499, 4563, 4663, 4693, 4709, 4801, 4808, 4934, 5162, 5212 and 5416 wrecked and were retired.\n\n|-\n|[[Canadian National Railway]]\n|228\n|2500\u20132727\n|2500\u20132522 are model C44-9WL, 2523\u20132727 are model C44-9CW, 2697\u20132726 are operated by [[Illinois Central Railroad|Illinois Central]]. 2727 was previously 2667.

Retrieved 2010-10-31.</ref>\n\nThe film was released in the United States on April 22, 2011. It received mixed reviews from film critics and grossed $117 million worldwide for a budget of $38 million.\n\n==Plot==\nCharlie O'Brien ([[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]]), Circus Vargas' owner, encounters an elderly man named Jacob Jankowski ([[Robert Pattinson]]), who is separated from his [[nursing home]] group. The two strike up a conversation and Jacob reveals he had a career in the circus business and was present during one of the most infamous circus disasters of all time, equal in seriousness to the 1944 [[Hartford circus fire]] and the [[Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus wreck]].\n\nJankowski tells his story to O'Brien, starting in 1931 when he was a 23-year-old [[veterinary medicine]] student at [[Cornell University]]. During his final exam, he is informed that his parents were killed in a car accident. His father has left huge debts, and the bank was foreclosing on Jacob's home. Feeling there is no point in returning to school, and having no home to go to, he jumps onto a passing train where he meets a kind old man named Camel ([[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]]).\n\nJacob wakes up the next morning and discovers that he jumped on the Benzini Bros. [[circus train]]. He sees a beautiful young woman named Marlena Rosenbluth ([[Reese Witherspoon]]), and meets August ([[Christoph Waltz]]), the circus's ringmaster, head animal trainer, and Marlena's husband. Jacob reveals he studied veterinary science and August hires Jacob as a vet for the circus animals after Jacob tells August that Silver (a show horse) has [[laminitis]].\n\nAugust instructs Jacob to fix Silver and keep him performing as long as possible. But Jacob cannot bear to see Silver's suffering and takes it upon himself to tell Marlena and shoots Silver.  August is furious with Jacob's decision to euthanize Silver against orders. To show Jacob who is boss, he threatens to throw him off the moving train \u2014 telling him that an animal's suffering is nothing compared to a man's, and that Jacob must carry out all of August's future orders if he wishes to keep his job.\n\nAugust eventually procures Rosie the elephant as Silver's replacement. He invites Jacob to his car for dinner and cocktails with him and Marlena. Jacob watches the married couple flirt and dance in front of him, but it becomes clear that their relationship is complicated because August is possessive, jealous and rough with Marlena.\n\nIn the next few weeks, August becomes frustrated when Rosie seems impossible to train. August is brutal with Rosie, beating her with a bullhook when she fails to follow orders. After a brutal beating that August gave to Rosie when she ran away after fleeing from the event and dropping Marlena, Jacob realizes that the elephant only understands [[Polish language|Polish]] commands. After that, Rosie performs beautifully and the circus enjoys a short period of success. While working together to train Rosie, Jacob and Marlena fall in love. After August discovers this, he cruelly taunts the two, even to a point where he forced the two of them to kiss in front of him. Marlena discovers that August plans to throw Jacob from the train and they run away together, hiding in a local hotel. Soon after consummating their relationship, they are ambushed by August's henchmen who drag Marlena away and beat up Jacob.\n\nJacob returns to the circus to find Marlena. Marlena tells Jacob that his friends Walter ([[Mark Povinelli]]) and Camel were thrown from the train and killed. Several circus employees have become fed up with August's murderous cruelty and unleash their revenge by unlocking all the animals' cages while the big top tent is jam-packed with an audience enjoying Marlena and Rosie's performance. Jacob attempts to find Marlena in the chaos, but August attacks him. Marlena tries to save Jacob from being beaten by August, but this causes the latter to turn his fury on her. August attempts to kill Marlena by choking her while Jacob fights with one of August's henchmen, who easily defeats him. Wade and Grady (Stephen Monroe Taylor and [[Richard Brake]]), two of Jacob's best friends and one of the circus workers save Jacob, who sees Rosie hit August on the back of the head with an iron stake, killing him. As a result, Benzini Bros. is officially shut down, and no one is charged with releasing the animals.\n\nBack in the present, Jacob explains to O'Brien in flashbacks that he returned to Cornell and finished his degree. He and Marlena took several horses and Rosie, and got jobs with the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]]. Jacob worked as a veterinarian and she continued to perform with Rosie. They married, had children and kept Rosie until her death.

It received mixed reviews from film critics and grossed $117 million worldwide for a budget of $38 million.\n\n==Plot==\nCharlie O'Brien ([[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]]), Circus Vargas' owner, encounters an elderly man named Jacob Jankowski ([[Robert Pattinson]]), who is separated from his [[nursing home]] group. The two strike up a conversation and Jacob reveals he had a career in the circus business and was present during one of the most infamous circus disasters of all time, equal in seriousness to the 1944 [[Hartford circus fire]] and the [[Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus wreck]].\n\nJankowski tells his story to O'Brien, starting in 1931 when he was a 23-year-old [[veterinary medicine]] student at [[Cornell University]]. During his final exam, he is informed that his parents were killed in a car accident. His father has left huge debts, and the bank was foreclosing on Jacob's home. Feeling there is no point in returning to school, and having no home to go to, he jumps onto a passing train where he meets a kind old man named Camel ([[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]]).\n\nJacob wakes up the next morning and discovers that he jumped on the Benzini Bros. [[circus train]]. He sees a beautiful young woman named Marlena Rosenbluth ([[Reese Witherspoon]]), and meets August ([[Christoph Waltz]]), the circus's ringmaster, head animal trainer, and Marlena's husband. Jacob reveals he studied veterinary science and August hires Jacob as a vet for the circus animals after Jacob tells August that Silver (a show horse) has [[laminitis]].\n\nAugust instructs Jacob to fix Silver and keep him performing as long as possible. But Jacob cannot bear to see Silver's suffering and takes it upon himself to tell Marlena and shoots Silver.  August is furious with Jacob's decision to euthanize Silver against orders. To show Jacob who is boss, he threatens to throw him off the moving train \u2014 telling him that an animal's suffering is nothing compared to a man's, and that Jacob must carry out all of August's future orders if he wishes to keep his job.\n\nAugust eventually procures Rosie the elephant as Silver's replacement. He invites Jacob to his car for dinner and cocktails with him and Marlena. Jacob watches the married couple flirt and dance in front of him, but it becomes clear that their relationship is complicated because August is possessive, jealous and rough with Marlena.\n\nIn the next few weeks, August becomes frustrated when Rosie seems impossible to train. August is brutal with Rosie, beating her with a bullhook when she fails to follow orders. After a brutal beating that August gave to Rosie when she ran away after fleeing from the event and dropping Marlena, Jacob realizes that the elephant only understands [[Polish language|Polish]] commands. After that, Rosie performs beautifully and the circus enjoys a short period of success. While working together to train Rosie, Jacob and Marlena fall in love. After August discovers this, he cruelly taunts the two, even to a point where he forced the two of them to kiss in front of him. Marlena discovers that August plans to throw Jacob from the train and they run away together, hiding in a local hotel. Soon after consummating their relationship, they are ambushed by August's henchmen who drag Marlena away and beat up Jacob.\n\nJacob returns to the circus to find Marlena. Marlena tells Jacob that his friends Walter ([[Mark Povinelli]]) and Camel were thrown from the train and killed. Several circus employees have become fed up with August's murderous cruelty and unleash their revenge by unlocking all the animals' cages while the big top tent is jam-packed with an audience enjoying Marlena and Rosie's performance. Jacob attempts to find Marlena in the chaos, but August attacks him. Marlena tries to save Jacob from being beaten by August, but this causes the latter to turn his fury on her. August attempts to kill Marlena by choking her while Jacob fights with one of August's henchmen, who easily defeats him. Wade and Grady (Stephen Monroe Taylor and [[Richard Brake]]), two of Jacob's best friends and one of the circus workers save Jacob, who sees Rosie hit August on the back of the head with an iron stake, killing him. As a result, Benzini Bros. is officially shut down, and no one is charged with releasing the animals.\n\nBack in the present, Jacob explains to O'Brien in flashbacks that he returned to Cornell and finished his degree. He and Marlena took several horses and Rosie, and got jobs with the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]]. Jacob worked as a veterinarian and she continued to perform with Rosie. They married, had children and kept Rosie until her death. He took on a job as a vet at the Albany Zoo and after more children and many happy years together Marlena died.\n \nO'Brien then asks Jacob to work as the ticket taker, to which Jacob agrees.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Marlena Rosenbluth\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as Jacob Jankowski\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] as older Jacob Jankowski\n* [[Christoph Waltz]] as August Rosenbluth\n* [[Tai (elephant)|Tai]] as Rosie, the elephant\n* [[James Frain]] as Rosie's caretaker\n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as Charlie O'Brien\n* [[Ken Foree]] as Earl\n* [[Tim Guinee]] as Diamond Joe\n* [[Mark Povinelli]] as Kinko/Walter\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)|Scott MacDonald]] as Blackie\n* [[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]] as Camel\n* [[Richard Brake]] as Grady\n* [[Sam Anderson]] as Mr. Hyde\n* [[John Aylward]] as Mr. Ervin\n* [[Brad Greenquist]] as Mr. Robinson \n* [[Uggie]] as Queenie, the terrier\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nOn a budget of $38 million,<ref name=\"LABox\">{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/04/movie-projector-water-for-elephants-tyler-perrys-madeas-big-happy-family.html |title=Movie Projector: Tyler Perry's latest 'Madea' film should trample 'Water for Elephants' |last=Kaufman |first=Amy |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=April 21, 2011 |accessdate=April 21, 2011}}</ref> filming began on May 20, 2010 in [[Los Angeles]], [[Piru, California|Piru]], [[Fillmore, California|Fillmore]] in [[California]]; [[Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]]; [[Kensington, Georgia|Kensington]] and [[Chickamauga, Georgia|Chickamauga]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].
