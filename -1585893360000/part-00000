It was written by both alongside [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Ilya Salmanzadeh|Ilya]] and [[Max Martin]], being produced by the latter two with [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], with [[Carolina Liar|Peter Carlsson]] serving as a vocal producer. The song was released by [[Republic Records]] on April 28, 2014, as the [[lead single]] from Grande's second studio album ''[[My Everything (Ariana Grande album)|My Everything]]'' (2014). \"Problem\" is an [[uptempo]] [[dance-pop]] song with influences of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music, which comprises a melody based on [[drums]], [[saxophone]] loops, and [[trumpets]]. The chorus features uncredited background vocals from American hip hop artist [[Big Sean]]. Lyrically, Grande has stated that the song is about \"the feeling of being absolutely terrified to re-approach a relationship that's gone sour \u2013 but you want to more than anything.\"\n\nThe song debuted at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] selling 438,000 copies in its first week on sale, earning Grande her biggest digital song sales week ever. The song later peaked at number two, surpassing \"[[The Way (Ariana Grande song)|The Way]]\" as her highest-charting single in the United States at the time. It also became Azalea's second-highest charting single in the US, after her own single \"[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]\". \"Problem\" remained in the top ten of the Hot 100 for the first sixteen weeks of its chart run, making its number three debut on May 7, 2014 and dropping out of the top ten on August 27, 2014. It topped the US [[Mainstream Top 40]] and [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic]] charts. Internationally, the single debuted at the top of the charts in Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland and the United Kingdom, while peaking within the top ten of the charts in most other territories, including Australia, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Greece. \"Problem\" became the first song to top the UK Singles chart based on both sales and streaming.\n\nTo promote the song, Grande performed it first at the [[2014 Radio Disney Music Awards]], followed by the [[2014 iHeartRadio Music Awards]], on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' and at the [[2014 Billboard Music Awards]]. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by Nev Todorovic and premiered on [[Vevo]] on May 30, 2014. It won \"Best Pop Video\" at the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards]] and has been viewed more than 1.2 billion times. The song itself won \"Best Song\" at the [[2014 MTV Europe Music Awards]].\n\nAs of 2018, the single has sold 3.<!--pure sales per Billboard citation-->7 million copies in the US and has been certified sextuple [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in March 2016.

It was written by both alongside [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Ilya Salmanzadeh|Ilya]] and [[Max Martin]], being produced by the latter two with [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], with [[Carolina Liar|Peter Carlsson]] serving as a vocal producer. The song was released by [[Republic Records]] on April 28, 2014, as the [[lead single]] from Grande's second studio album ''[[My Everything (Ariana Grande album)|My Everything]]'' (2014). \"Problem\" is an [[uptempo]] [[dance-pop]] song with influences of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music, which comprises a melody based on [[drums]], [[saxophone]] loops, and [[trumpets]]. The chorus features uncredited background vocals from American hip hop artist [[Big Sean]]. Lyrically, Grande has stated that the song is about \"the feeling of being absolutely terrified to re-approach a relationship that's gone sour \u2013 but you want to more than anything.\"\n\nThe song debuted at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] selling 438,000 copies in its first week on sale, earning Grande her biggest digital song sales week ever. The song later peaked at number two, surpassing \"[[The Way (Ariana Grande song)|The Way]]\" as her highest-charting single in the United States at the time. It also became Azalea's second-highest charting single in the US, after her own single \"[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]\". \"Problem\" remained in the top ten of the Hot 100 for the first sixteen weeks of its chart run, making its number three debut on May 7, 2014 and dropping out of the top ten on August 27, 2014. It topped the US [[Mainstream Top 40]] and [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic]] charts. Internationally, the single debuted at the top of the charts in Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland and the United Kingdom, while peaking within the top ten of the charts in most other territories, including Australia, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Greece. \"Problem\" became the first song to top the UK Singles chart based on both sales and streaming.\n\nTo promote the song, Grande performed it first at the [[2014 Radio Disney Music Awards]], followed by the [[2014 iHeartRadio Music Awards]], on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' and at the [[2014 Billboard Music Awards]]. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by Nev Todorovic and premiered on [[Vevo]] on May 30, 2014. It won \"Best Pop Video\" at the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards]] and has been viewed more than 1.2 billion times. The song itself won \"Best Song\" at the [[2014 MTV Europe Music Awards]].\n\nAs of 2018, the single has sold 3.<!--pure sales per Billboard citation-->7 million copies in the US and has been certified sextuple [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in March 2016.

Most bells have the shape of a hollow cup that when struck vibrates in a single strong [[strike tone]], with its sides forming an efficient [[resonator]]. The strike may be made by an internal \"clapper\" or \"uvula\", an external hammer, or\u2014in small bells\u2014by a small loose sphere enclosed within the body of the bell ([[jingle bell]]).\n\nBells are usually cast from [[bell metal]] (a type of [[bronze]]) for its resonant properties, but can also be made from other hard materials; this depends on the function. Some small bells such as ornamental bells or cow bells can be made from cast or pressed metal, glass or ceramic, but large bells such as church, clock and tower bells are normally cast from bell metal.\n\nBells intended to be heard over a wide area can range from a single bell hung in a turret or [[bell-gable]], to a musical ensemble such as an English [[ring of bells]], a [[carillon]] or a Russian [[Russian Orthodox bell ringing|zvon]] which are tuned to a common scale and installed in a [[bell tower]]. Many public or institutional buildings house bells, most commonly as [[Striking clock|clock bells]] to sound the hours and quarters. They\u2019re noisy as fuuuuuuck.\n\nHistorically, bells have been associated with religious rites, and are still used to call communities together for religious services.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia\n| title = Bell\n| encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th Edition\n| volume = 3\n| pages = 687\u2013691\n| publisher = University Press\n| year = 1910\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EjMEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA687\n| accessdate = 2012-02-01}}</ref> Later, bells were made to commemorate important events or people and have been associated with the concepts of peace and freedom.

BC) of the British Museum collection.\n\n== Styles of ringing ==\n[[File:Il est midi.webm|thumb|Static bells struck by [[solenoid]]-operated hammers in a bell-gable.]]\n[[File:English full circle bell mechanism.png|thumb|Mechanism of a bell hung for English full-circle ringing. The bell can swing through a full circle in alternate directions.]]\n[[File:St bees bells in down position.JPG|thumb|English full-circle bells shown in the \"down\" position, in which they are normally left between ringing sessions.]]\n[[File:St Bees bells in up position.jpg|thumb|English full-circle bells shown in the \"up\" position.]]\nIn the [[western world]], the common form of bell is a [[church bell]] or town bell, which is hung within a tower or bell cote. Such bells are either fixed in a static position (\"hung dead\") or mounted on a beam (the \"headstock\") so they can swing to and fro. Bells that are hung dead are normally sounded by hitting the sound bow with a hammer or occasionally by pulling an internal clapper against the bell.\n\nWhere a bell is swung it can either be swung over a small arc by a rope and lever or by using a rope on a wheel to swing the bell higher.  As the bell swings higher the sound is projected outwards rather than downwards.  Larger bells may be swung using electric motors.  In some places, such as [[Salzburg Cathedral]] the clappers are held against the sound bow whilst the bells are raised, then released sequentially to give a clean start to the ringing.  At the end they are successively caught again by the mechanism to silence the bells.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t7YCQvRYsA|accessdate=6 September 2018|title=Salzburg (Austria) The bells of Salzburg cathedral|date=24 September 2015|publisher=YouTube|author=Glockenfampf}}</ref>\n\nBells hung for [[full circle ringing]] are swung through just over a complete circle from mouth uppermost.  A '''stay''' (the wooden pole seen sticking up when the bells are down) engages a mechanism to allow the bell to rest just past its balance point.  The rope is attached to one side of a wheel so that a different amount of rope is wound on and off as it swings to and fro. The bells are controlled by ringers (one to a bell) in a chamber below, who rotate the bell to through a full circle and back, and control the speed of oscillation when the bell is mouth upwards at the balance-point, when little effort is required.\n\nSwinging bells are sounded by an internal clapper.  The clapper may have a longer period of swing than the bell. In this case the bell will catch up with the clapper and if rung to or near full circle will carry the clapper up on the bell's trailing side.  Alternatively, the clapper may have a shorter period and catch up with the bell's leading side, travel up with the bell coming to rest on the downhill side.  This latter method is used in English style full circle ringing.\n\n{{anchor|muffles}}\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

Also at funerals, ''half-muffles'' are often used to give a full open sound on one round, and a muffled sound on the alternate round \u2013 a distinctive, mournful effect. This was done at the [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997.\n\nA [[carillon]], which is a musical instrument consisting of at least 23 cast bronze cup-shaped bells, is tuned so that the bells can be played serially to produce a melody, or sounded together to play a chord. A traditional carillon is played by striking a baton keyboard with the fists, and by pressing the keys of a pedal keyboard with the feet. The keys mechanically activate levers and wires that connect to metal clappers that strike the inside of the bells, allowing the performer to vary the intensity of the note according to the force applied to the key.\n\n== Church and temple bells ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[\u014cmisoka]] -->\n{{main|Church bell}}\n\nIn the [[Eastern world]], the traditional forms of bells are temple and palace bells, small ones being rung by a sharp rap with a stick, and very large ones rung by a blow from the outside by a large swinging beam. (''See'' images of the great bell of Mii-dera below.)\n\nThe striking technique is employed worldwide for some of the largest tower-borne bells, because swinging the bells themselves could damage their towers.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and among some High [[Lutherans]] and [[Anglican]]s, small hand-held bells, called [[Sanctus]] or [[Altar bell|sacring bells]],<ref>Herrera, Matthew D.''Sanctus Bells: Their History and Use in the Catholic Church.''

This serves to indicate to the congregation that the bread and wine have just been transformed into the Body and Blood of Christ (see [[transubstantiation]]), or, in the alternative [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] teaching, that Christ is now bodily present in the elements, and that what the priest is holding up for them to look at is Christ himself (see [[consubstantiation]]).\n\nIn [[Russian Orthodox bell ringing]], the entire bell never moves, only the clapper. A complex system of ropes is developed and used uniquely for every bell tower. Some ropes (the smaller ones) are played by hand, the bigger ropes are played by foot.\n\n=== Bells in Japanese religion ===\n[[Japan]]ese [[Shinto]]ist and [[Buddhist]] bells are used in religious ceremonies. ''[[Suzu]]'', a homophone meaning both \"cool\" and \"refreshing\", are spherical bells which contain metal pellets that produce sound from the inside. The hemispherical bell is the ''[[Kane (musical instrument)|Kane]]'' bell, which is struck on the outside. Large suspended temple bells are known as ''[[bonsh\u014d]]''. (See also [[:ja:\u9234]], [[:ja:\u68b5\u9418]]).\n\n=== Bells in Buddhism and Hinduism ===\n[[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] bells, called ''\"[[Ghanta]]\"'' (IAST: Gha\u1e47\u1e6d\u0101) in Sanskrit, are used in religious ceremonies.

Such a mould has an outer section clamped to a base-plate on which an inner core has been constructed.<ref>Jennings (1988: 3; 10)</ref>\n\nThe core is built on the base-plate using porous materials such as [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] or brick and then covered in [[loam]] well mixed with straw and horse manure. This is given a profile corresponding to the inside shape of the finished bell, and dried with gentle heat. [[Graphite]] and [[Calcium carbonate#Industrial applications|whiting]] are applied to form the final, smooth surface.\n\nThe outside of the mould is made within a perforated cast iron case, larger than the finished bell, containing the loam mixture which is shaped, dried and smoothed in the same way as the core. The case is inverted (mouth down), lowered over the core and clamped to the base plate. The clamped mould is supported, usually by being buried in a ''casting pit'' to bear the weight of metal and to allow even cooling.<ref>Jennings (1988: 11)</ref>\n\nHistorically, before rail or road transport of large bells was possible, a \"bell pit\" was often dug in the grounds of the building where the bell was to be installed. Molten bell metal is poured into the mould through a box lined with [[Sand casting#Molding box and materials|foundry sand]]. The founder would bring his casting tools to the site, and a furnace would be built next to the pit.\n\n===Bell tuning===\n[[File:Erfurt Bell.png|thumb|The principal harmonics of the [[Maria Gloriosa|Erfurt bell]] (1497)<ref>Musical Association (1902).

However, the tone of a bell is mostly due to its shape. A bell is regarded as having a good tone when it's \"in tune with itself\".<ref name=\"Groves\" /> In western bell founding, this is known as \"harmonic tuning\" of a bell, which results in the bell's strongest harmonics being in harmony with each other and the strike note. This produces the brightest and purest sound, which is the attractive sound of a good bell. A huge amount of effort has been expended over the centuries in finding the shape which will produce the harmonically tuned bell.\n\nThe accompanying musical staves show the series of harmonics which are generated when a bell is struck. The [[Erfurt bell]] is notable that it although it is an old bell, it is harmonically tuned, but was not typical of its time. [[Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony]] in the 17th century reliably cast many bells for carillons of unequalled quality of tuning for the time, but after their death their guarded trade secrets were lost, and not until the 19th century were bells of comparable tuning quality cast. It was only in modern times that repeatable harmonic tuning using a known scientific basis was achieved. The main partials (or harmonics) of a well-tuned bell are:\n\n* hum note (an octave below the named note)\n* strike tone (also called tap note or named note)\n* tierce (a minor third above named note)\n* quint (a fifth above named note)\n* nominal (an octave above named note)\n\nFurther, less-audible,  harmonics include the major third and a perfect fifth in the second octave above the named note.\n\nThis quest by various founders over centuries of bell founding has resulted in development of an optimum profile for casting each size of bell to give true harmonic tuning. Although bells are cast to accurate patterns, variations in casting mean that a final tuning is necessary as the shape of the bell is critical in producing the desired strike note and associated harmonics. Tuning is undertaken by clamping the bell on a large rotating table, and using a cutting tool to remove metal. This is an iterative process in which metal is removed from certain parts of the bell to change certain harmonics. This process was made possible historically by the use of tuning forks to find sympathetic resonance on specific parts of a bell for the harmonic being tuned, but today electronic [[Electronic tuner#Strobe tuner|strobe tuners]] are normally used. To tune the strike note, the nominal or the strike note are tuned; the effect is usually the same because the nominal is one of the main partials that determines the tone of the strike note.<ref name=\"Physics\">Neville Horner Fletcher, Thomas D.

Indeed, the word ''clock'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''Cloca'', meaning ''bell''. Bells in clock towers or [[bell tower]]s can be heard over long distances, which was especially important in the time when clocks were too expensive for widespread use.\n\nIn the case of clock towers and grandfather clocks, a particular sequence of tones may be played to distinguish between the hour, half-hour, quarter-hour, or other intervals.

The interval between these notes on each bell is either a [[major third|major]] or [[minor third]], equivalent to a distance of four or five notes on a piano.<ref>Alan Thorne & Robert Raymond, ''Man on the Rim: The Peopling of the Pacific'' (ABC Books, 1989), pp. 166\u201367</ref>\n\nThe bells of Marquis Yi\u2014which were still fully playable after almost 2500 years\u2014cover a range of slightly less than five octaves but thanks to their dual-tone capability, the set can sound a complete 12-tone scale\u2014predating the development of the European 12-tone system by some 2000 years\u2014and can play melodies in [[diatonic]] and [[pentatonic]] scales.<ref>[http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/30Arts391.html Cultural China website \u2013  \"Bronze Chime Bells of Marquis Yi\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203021322/http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/30Arts391.html |date=2011-02-03 }}</ref>\n\nAnother related ancient Chinese musical instrument is called [[Bianqing|qing]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060521073710/http://www.china.org.cn/chinese/ch-tw/pic1/e-3.htm \u78ec] [[pinyin]] q\u00ecng) but it was made of stone instead of metal.\n\nIn more recent times, the top of bells in China was usually decorated with a small dragon, known as ''[[pulao (dragon)|pulao]]''; the figure of the dragon served as a hook for hanging the bell.\n[[File:Hawksbelleasttennmound.png|upright=.5|thumb|This copper bell was made by pre-Columbian North American natives.]]\n\n===Konguro'o===\nKonguro'o is a small bell which, like the [[Djalaajyn]], was first used for utilitarian purposes and only later for artistic ones. Konguro'o rang when moving to new places. They were fastened to the horse harnesses and created a very specific \"smart\" sound background. Konguro'o also hung on the neck of the leader goat, which the sheep herd followed. This led to the association in folk memory between the distinctive sound of konguro'o and the nomadic way of life.\n\nTo make this instrument, [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] foremen used copper, bronze, iron and brass. They also decorated it with artistic carving and covered it with silver. Sizes of the instruments might vary within certain limits, what depended on its function. Every bell had its own timbre.\n\n===Chimes===\nA variant on the bell is the [[tubular bell]]. Several of these metal tubes which are struck manually with hammers, form an instrument named ''tubular bells'' or ''chimes''. In the case of wind or aeolian chimes, the tubes are blown against one another by the wind.\n\n===Lithuanian Skrabalai===\nThe [[skrabalai]] is a traditional folk instrument in Lithuania which consists of wooden bells of various sizes hanging in several vertical rows with one or two wooden or metal small clappers hanging inside them. It is played with two wooden sticks. When the skrabalai is moved a clapper knocks at the wall of the trough. The pitch of the sound depends on the size of the wooden trough. The instrument developed from wooden [[cowbell]]s that shepherds would tie to cows' necks.\n\n== Farm bells ==\nWhereas the church and temple bells called to [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] or religious service, bells were used on [[farm]]s for more secular signaling. The greater farms in [[Scandinavia]] usually had a small bell-tower resting on the top of the [[barn]]. The bell was used to call the workers from the field at the end of the day's work.\n[[File:Glasgow deid bell.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Glasgow]] 'Dead or Deid bell' of 1642]]\nIn [[folk tradition]], it is recorded that each church and possibly several farms had their specific [[rhyme]]s connected to the sound of the specific bells. An example is the [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Idris Davies]] song \"[[The Bells of Rhymney]]\".\n\n==Dead bell==\nIn Scotland, up until the nineteenth century it was the tradition to ring a [[dead bell]], a form of hand bell, at the death of an individual and at the funeral.<ref>Adamson, Page 189</ref>\n\n==Bell study and ringing organisations==\nThe following organizations promote the ringing, study, music, collection, preservation and restoration of bells.<ref>Rama, Jean-Pierre (1993).

Most bells have the shape of a hollow cup that when struck vibrates in a single strong [[strike tone]], with its sides forming an efficient [[resonator]]. The strike may be made by an internal \"clapper\" or \"uvula\", an external hammer, or\u2014in small bells\u2014by a small loose sphere enclosed within the body of the bell ([[jingle bell]]).\n\nBells are usually cast from [[bell metal]] (a type of [[bronze]]) for its resonant properties, but can also be made from other hard materials; this depends on the function. Some small bells such as ornamental bells or cow bells can be made from cast or pressed metal, glass or ceramic, but large bells such as church, clock and tower bells are normally cast from bell metal.\n\nBells intended to be heard over a wide area can range from a single bell hung in a turret or [[bell-gable]], to a musical ensemble such as an English [[ring of bells]], a [[carillon]] or a Russian [[Russian Orthodox bell ringing|zvon]] which are tuned to a common scale and installed in a [[bell tower]]. Many public or institutional buildings house bells, most commonly as [[Striking clock|clock bells]] to sound the hours and quarters.\n\nHistorically, bells have been associated with religious rites, and are still used to call communities together for religious services.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia\n| title = Bell\n| encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th Edition\n| volume = 3\n| pages = 687\u2013691\n| publisher = University Press\n| year = 1910\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EjMEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA687\n| accessdate = 2012-02-01}}</ref> Later, bells were made to commemorate important events or people and have been associated with the concepts of peace and freedom.

The bell can swing through a full circle in alternate directions.]]\n[[File:St bees bells in down position.JPG|thumb|English full-circle bells shown in the \"down\" position, in which they are normally left between ringing sessions.]]\n[[File:St Bees bells in up position.jpg|thumb|English full-circle bells shown in the \"up\" position.]]\nIn the [[western world]], the common form of bell is a [[church bell]] or town bell, which is hung within a tower or bell cote. Such bells are either fixed in a static position (\"hung dead\") or mounted on a beam (the \"headstock\") so they can swing to and fro. Bells that are hung dead are normally sounded by hitting the sound bow with a hammer or occasionally by pulling an internal clapper against the bell.\n\nWhere a bell is swung it can either be swung over a small arc by a rope and lever or by using a rope on a wheel to swing the bell higher.  As the bell swings higher the sound is projected outwards rather than downwards.  Larger bells may be swung using electric motors.  In some places, such as [[Salzburg Cathedral]] the clappers are held against the sound bow whilst the bells are raised, then released sequentially to give a clean start to the ringing.  At the end they are successively caught again by the mechanism to silence the bells.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t7YCQvRYsA|accessdate=6 September 2018|title=Salzburg (Austria) The bells of Salzburg cathedral|date=24 September 2015|publisher=YouTube|author=Glockenfampf}}</ref>\n\nBells hung for [[full circle ringing]] are swung through just over a complete circle from mouth uppermost.  A '''stay''' (the wooden pole seen sticking up when the bells are down) engages a mechanism to allow the bell to rest just past its balance point.  The rope is attached to one side of a wheel so that a different amount of rope is wound on and off as it swings to and fro. The bells are controlled by ringers (one to a bell) in a chamber below, who rotate the bell to through a full circle and back, and control the speed of oscillation when the bell is mouth upwards at the balance-point, when little effort is required.\n\nSwinging bells are sounded by an internal clapper.  The clapper may have a longer period of swing than the bell. In this case the bell will catch up with the clapper and if rung to or near full circle will carry the clapper up on the bell's trailing side.  Alternatively, the clapper may have a shorter period and catch up with the bell's leading side, travel up with the bell coming to rest on the downhill side.  This latter method is used in English style full circle ringing.\n\n{{anchor|muffles}}\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

Also at funerals, ''half-muffles'' are often used to give a full open sound on one round, and a muffled sound on the alternate round \u2013 a distinctive, mournful effect. This was done at the [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997.\n\nA [[carillon]], which is a musical instrument consisting of at least 23 cast bronze cup-shaped bells, is tuned so that the bells can be played serially to produce a melody, or sounded together to play a chord. A traditional carillon is played by striking a baton keyboard with the fists, and by pressing the keys of a pedal keyboard with the feet. The keys mechanically activate levers and wires that connect to metal clappers that strike the inside of the bells, allowing the performer to vary the intensity of the note according to the force applied to the key.\n\n== Church and temple bells ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[\u014cmisoka]] -->\n{{main|Church bell}}\n\nIn the [[Eastern world]], the traditional forms of bells are temple and palace bells, small ones being rung by a sharp rap with a stick, and very large ones rung by a blow from the outside by a large swinging beam. (''See'' images of the great bell of Mii-dera below.)\n\nThe striking technique is employed worldwide for some of the largest tower-borne bells, because swinging the bells themselves could damage their towers.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and among some High [[Lutherans]] and [[Anglican]]s, small hand-held bells, called [[Sanctus]] or [[Altar bell|sacring bells]],<ref>Herrera, Matthew D.''Sanctus Bells: Their History and Use in the Catholic Church.''

This serves to indicate to the congregation that the bread and wine have just been transformed into the Body and Blood of Christ (see [[transubstantiation]]), or, in the alternative [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] teaching, that Christ is now bodily present in the elements, and that what the priest is holding up for them to look at is Christ himself (see [[consubstantiation]]).\n\nIn [[Russian Orthodox bell ringing]], the entire bell never moves, only the clapper. A complex system of ropes is developed and used uniquely for every bell tower. Some ropes (the smaller ones) are played by hand, the bigger ropes are played by foot.\n\n=== Bells in Japanese religion ===\n[[Japan]]ese [[Shinto]]ist and [[Buddhist]] bells are used in religious ceremonies. ''[[Suzu]]'', a homophone meaning both \"cool\" and \"refreshing\", are spherical bells which contain metal pellets that produce sound from the inside. The hemispherical bell is the ''[[Kane (musical instrument)|Kane]]'' bell, which is struck on the outside. Large suspended temple bells are known as ''[[bonsh\u014d]]''. (See also [[:ja:\u9234]], [[:ja:\u68b5\u9418]]).\n\n=== Bells in Buddhism and Hinduism ===\n[[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] bells, called ''\"[[Ghanta]]\"'' (IAST: Gha\u1e47\u1e6d\u0101) in Sanskrit, are used in religious ceremonies.

This is given a profile corresponding to the inside shape of the finished bell, and dried with gentle heat. [[Graphite]] and [[Calcium carbonate#Industrial applications|whiting]] are applied to form the final, smooth surface.\n\nThe outside of the mould is made within a perforated cast iron case, larger than the finished bell, containing the loam mixture which is shaped, dried and smoothed in the same way as the core. The case is inverted (mouth down), lowered over the core and clamped to the base plate. The clamped mould is supported, usually by being buried in a ''casting pit'' to bear the weight of metal and to allow even cooling.<ref>Jennings (1988: 11)</ref>\n\nHistorically, before rail or road transport of large bells was possible, a \"bell pit\" was often dug in the grounds of the building where the bell was to be installed. Molten bell metal is poured into the mould through a box lined with [[Sand casting#Molding box and materials|foundry sand]]. The founder would bring his casting tools to the site, and a furnace would be built next to the pit.\n\n===Bell tuning===\n[[File:Erfurt Bell.png|thumb|The principal harmonics of the [[Maria Gloriosa|Erfurt bell]] (1497)<ref>Musical Association (1902).

However, the tone of a bell is mostly due to its shape. A bell is regarded as having a good tone when it's \"in tune with itself\".<ref name=\"Groves\" /> In western bell founding, this is known as \"harmonic tuning\" of a bell, which results in the bell's strongest harmonics being in harmony with each other and the strike note. This produces the brightest and purest sound, which is the attractive sound of a good bell. A huge amount of effort has been expended over the centuries in finding the shape which will produce the harmonically tuned bell.\n\nThe accompanying musical staves show the series of harmonics which are generated when a bell is struck. The [[Erfurt bell]] is notable that it although it is an old bell, it is harmonically tuned, but was not typical of its time. [[Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony]] in the 17th century reliably cast many bells for carillons of unequalled quality of tuning for the time, but after their death their guarded trade secrets were lost, and not until the 19th century were bells of comparable tuning quality cast. It was only in modern times that repeatable harmonic tuning using a known scientific basis was achieved. The main partials (or harmonics) of a well-tuned bell are:\n\n* hum note (an octave below the named note)\n* strike tone (also called tap note or named note)\n* tierce (a minor third above named note)\n* quint (a fifth above named note)\n* nominal (an octave above named note)\n\nFurther, less-audible,  harmonics include the major third and a perfect fifth in the second octave above the named note.\n\nThis quest by various founders over centuries of bell founding has resulted in development of an optimum profile for casting each size of bell to give true harmonic tuning. Although bells are cast to accurate patterns, variations in casting mean that a final tuning is necessary as the shape of the bell is critical in producing the desired strike note and associated harmonics. Tuning is undertaken by clamping the bell on a large rotating table, and using a cutting tool to remove metal. This is an iterative process in which metal is removed from certain parts of the bell to change certain harmonics. This process was made possible historically by the use of tuning forks to find sympathetic resonance on specific parts of a bell for the harmonic being tuned, but today electronic [[Electronic tuner#Strobe tuner|strobe tuners]] are normally used. To tune the strike note, the nominal or the strike note are tuned; the effect is usually the same because the nominal is one of the main partials that determines the tone of the strike note.<ref name=\"Physics\">Neville Horner Fletcher, Thomas D.

On the theory that western music in major keys may sound better on bells with a major third as a harmonic, production of bells with major thirds was attempted in the 1980s. Scientists at the Technical University in Eindhoven, using computer modelling, produced bell profiles which were cast by the Eijsbouts Bellfoundry in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"Physics\"/> They were described as resembling old Coke bottles<ref>http://www.cs.yale.edu/~douglas-craig/bells/Basic/what-is-a-carillon.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> in that they had a bulge around the middle;<ref>\"[http://www.andrelehr.nl/woboek/f_56.htm Major third bell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018230102/http://www.andrelehr.nl/woboek/f_56.htm |date=2007-10-18 }}\", ''Andrelehr.nl''.</ref> In 1999 a design without the bulge was announced.<ref>Rossing, Thomas D.

Indeed, the word ''clock'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''Cloca'', meaning ''bell''. Bells in clock towers or [[bell tower]]s can be heard over long distances, which was especially important in the time when clocks were too expensive for widespread use.\n\nIn the case of clock towers and grandfather clocks, a particular sequence of tones may be played to distinguish between the hour, half-hour, quarter-hour, or other intervals.

Konguro'o rang when moving to new places. They were fastened to the horse harnesses and created a very specific \"smart\" sound background. Konguro'o also hung on the neck of the leader goat, which the sheep herd followed. This led to the association in folk memory between the distinctive sound of konguro'o and the nomadic way of life.\n\nTo make this instrument, [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] foremen used copper, bronze, iron and brass.

The game is a [[Clone (computing)|clone]] of the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' franchise, and as such, features nearly identical gameplay.

Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]'', using [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] assets from those games. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device. Players must hold specific buttons that line up with colored notes that appear on the screen on a \"highway\"; when the notes hit the bottom of the highway, the player must strum to hit the notes in time with the music. There is also an \"open strum\" note, represented with a purple bar, which requires the player to strum without pressing any other buttons. In addition to normal notes, there are \"HOPO\"s (\"[[Hammer-on|Hammer-ons]]\" and \"[[Pull-off|Pull-offs]]\") and \"tap notes\", which both do not require the player to strum them to hit them, with the difference between the two being that a string of HOPOs must begin with a strum, and the player must re-strum if they miss a note. Unlike the ''Guitar Hero'' series, by default there is no penalty for missing notes, aside from breaking a combo, making it impossible to fail a song, although there is an option to enable this. The game also contains a mode which emulates the gameplay of ''[[Guitar Hero Live]]'', which is notably different from other games in the series, as well as support for drum-based charts.\n\n=== Community-made charts ===\n''Clone Hero'' has the ability to play community-made songs, called \"charts\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|title=The spirit of Guitar Hero lives on in a bizarre community-made clone|last=Stubbs|first=Mike|date=2018-05-01|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|title=Guitar Heroes never die, they just start playing Clone Hero|last=Neilan|first=Dan|date=August 10, 2018|website=AV Club|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> However, unlike games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, these songs do not need to be original compositions, and can instead be any audio file a member of the community wishes to turn into a playable chart.
