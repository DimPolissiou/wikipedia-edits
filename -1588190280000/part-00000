He was the eldest son of [[Finw\u00eb]], the High King of the [[Noldor]], and his first wife M\u00edriel Serind\u00eb. F\u00ebanor's mother, M\u00edriel, died shortly after giving birth, having given all her strength and essence to him. \"For F\u00ebanor was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind: in valour, in endurance, in beauty, in understanding, in skill, in strength and subtlety alike: of all the Children of Il\u00favatar, and a bright flame was in him.\"\n\nFinw\u00eb remarried, and had two more sons, F\u00ebanor's half-brothers '''Fingolfin''' and '''Finarfin''', and two daughters, Findis and \u00cdrim\u00eb.\n\nF\u00ebanor's three jewels, the Silmarils, form a central theme of ''The Silmarillion'' as the human and elvish characters battle with the forces of evil for their possession.

[[Morgoth|Melkor]], recently released from three ages of imprisonment in the [[Halls of Mandos]] and now residing in [[Valinor]], saw in this suspicion an opportunity to sow dissension among the [[Noldor]]. F\u00ebanor did not trust Melkor and refused to communicate with him, but was still caught in the evil Ainu's plot.\n\nMelkor used F\u00ebanor's anger and pride against him, telling him that his own half-brother Fingolfin was planning to usurp his place as heir to Finw\u00eb. F\u00ebanor threatened Fingolfin's life. (It was at this time that the Noldor, driven to distrust by Melkor's guile, first began to forge weapons, which would later be used against the [[Teleri]].) As punishment for his threat, the Valar exiled F\u00ebanor to [[Formenos]]. He took a substantial treasure with him, including the Silmarils, which he put in a locked box. In support for his eldest son, Finw\u00eb also withdrew to Formenos.\n\nThe Valar then learned that Melkor was manipulating F\u00ebanor, and sent [[Tulkas]] to capture Melkor, but he had already escaped. With Finw\u00eb and F\u00ebanor's absence, Fingolfin had become king, and so it seemed that Melkor's lies were true. Melkor tried again to convince F\u00ebanor of them, but F\u00ebanor realised that Melkor's true goal was to obtain the Silmarils, \"and he shut the doors of his house in the face of the mightiest of all the dwellers in [[E\u00e4]].\" In a rage, Melkor left. The Valar invited F\u00ebanor and Fingolfin to Valinor to make peace. Fingolfin offered a hand to his half-brother, recognising F\u00ebanor's place as the eldest. He gave his pledge to follow his elder brother and F\u00ebanor accepted.\n\nMeanwhile, Melkor went to [[Avathar]] in the south of [[Aman (Middle-earth)|Aman]] to seek out [[Ungoliant]]. The monstrous spider helped Melkor to destroy the [[Two Trees]]. Melkor and Ungoliant then went to Formenos, slew Finw\u00eb, and took the three Silmarils. They escaped by crossing the [[Helcarax\u00eb]], or Grinding Ice, in the north to [[Beleriand]].\n\nThe Trees were destroyed during the reunion of F\u00ebanor and Fingolfin. The Valar, realising that now the light of the Trees survived only in the Silmarils, asked F\u00ebanor to give them up so that they could restore the Trees. F\u00ebanor said: \"It may be that I can unlock my jewels, but never again shall I make their like; and if I must break them, I shall break my heart.\"<ref group=T>\"Of the Flight of the Noldor\". ''The Silmarillion''.</ref>\nAnd it was after this that he stated that he would not give up the Silmarils of his own free will; if the Valar forced him, he said, they would be no better than Melkor.\n\nEven then, however, he wavered, and some later believed that at this point it may have still been possible to convince him to change his mind.  However, messengers from Formenos then arrived and told that Finw\u00eb the High King of the Noldor had been killed by Melkor (and so was the first Elf to be slain in Valinor). Melkor had then stolen the Silmarils, as well as the other lesser jewels F\u00ebanor had created. Without the living light from the Silmarils, [[Yavanna]] could not heal the Two Trees.\n\nThe Valar and Eldar now fully understood the extent of Melkor's treachery. F\u00ebanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized Silmarils, named Melkor \"Morgoth\", or \"Black Foe of the World\" (literally \"Black Enemy\"). Now King of the Noldor in Tirion, F\u00ebanor delivered the most impassioned speech ever given in Arda, which he unwittingly filled with Morgoth's corruption. He railed against the Great Enemy, but because of Morgoth's influence, he also blamed the Valar for Morgoth's deeds. He persuaded most of his people that because the Valar had abandoned them, the Noldor must follow him to [[Middle-earth]] to wrest the Silmarils back from Morgoth and avenge Finw\u00eb.  He declared that even if the Noldor ever managed to recover the Silmarils, he would never give them to the Valar to help recreate the Two Trees.  F\u00ebanor then swore an oath which all seven of his sons also proclaimed, vowing to fight anyone and everyone\u2014whether [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]], [[Man (Middle-earth)|Man]], [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]], or Vala\u2014who withheld the Silmarils, swearing upon [[Il\u00favatar]] himself, and invoking the chief of the Valar and the mountains of Valinor themselves as witnesses. This became known as the '''Oath of F\u00ebanor''' and, later, the cause for great tragedy on Middle-earth, particularly among his seven sons.\n\n{{quote|text=They swore an oath which none shall break, and none should take, by the name even of Il\u00favatar, calling the Everlasting Dark upon them if they kept it not... ...vowing to pursue with vengeance and hatred to the ends of the World Vala, Demon, Elf or Man as yet unborn or any creature, great or small, good or evil, that time should bring forth unto the end of days, whoso should hold or take or keep a Silmaril from their possession. \u2014 ''Quenta Silmarillion''}}\n\nThe oath commanded F\u00ebanor to press to Middle-earth and resulted in the first Kinslaying at the havens of the Teleri. F\u00ebanor died soon after his return to Middle-earth but the remaining oath-takers, his sons, lived on in relative harmony with the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] of [[Beleriand]]. For the greater part of the [[First Age]] the oath kept the sons of F\u00ebanor united in one cause to defeat Morgoth and retrieve the jewels.\n\nHowever, the true dangers of the oath became apparent when the lovers [[Beren]] and [[L\u00fathien]] recovered one of the jewels from Morgoth, which ultimately came into the possession of Dior, their son, who ruled after his grandfather [[Thingol]] in [[Menegroth]]. The presence of the Silmaril awoke the oath and caused the brothers to make war on the Elves of [[Doriath]] because Dior refused to yield the jewel. The brothers attacked Doriath, killed Dior and sacked the halls of the [[Sindar]], committing the second Kinslaying. However, the Silmaril escaped the destruction of Doriath and the oath drove the sons onwards. When they learned that it was possessed by Elwing daughter of Dior, who dwelt near the mouths of [[River Sirion|Sirion]] together with exiles from Doriath and the city of [[Gondolin]], they attacked the place (after Elwing also refused to return the Silmaril to them), committing the third and most terrible Kinslaying. All six of the remaining brothers survived even the complete rout of their forces at the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad, but three of the brothers\u2014Celegorm, Curufin, and Caranthir\u2014died in the second sacking of Menegroth. At the third and final Kinslaying, Amras was slain.\n\nThe fate of another brother, Amrod, varies by source. In the published Silmarillion, Amrod dies at Sirion with his brother. In subsequently published material, he dies much sooner as part of an accident that occurs when his father burns the stolen Teleri ships at Losgar.\n\nBut the Silmaril escaped them again and was borne by [[E\u00e4rendil]] into the West. That Silmaril was lost to the sons of F\u00ebanor but two more remained inside the crown of Morgoth. So after the [[War of Wrath]] the two remaining oath-takers, [[Maedhros]] and Maglor, stole the two Silmarils from the camp of the victorious West (the other five brothers were dead by this time). However, due to the terrible deeds committed by the brothers in their retrieval of the Silmarils they found they could not handle the Silmarils without enduring searing pain. The two brothers parted: in their anguish Maedhros threw himself and his Silmaril into a fiery chasm, and Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Maglor would spend eternity wandering the shore, lamenting his fate (though in Tolkien's final words on the subject, Maglor cast himself with his Silmaril into the sea).\n\nTolkien wrote at least four versions of the oath itself, as found in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]].'' The three earliest versions are found in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'': In [[alliterative verse]] (circa 1918\u20131920s), in chapter 2, \"Poems Early Abandoned\". ''The Flight of the Noldoli from Valinor''. Lines 132\u2013141. In rhyming [[couplets]] (circa 1928), in chapter 3, \"[[The Lay of Leithian]]\". Canto VI, lines 1628\u20131643. In a different form as restated by Celegorm, third son of F\u00ebanor, in chapter 3, \"The Lay of Leithian.\" Canto VI, lines 1848\u20131857. A later version is found in ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\nThe Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] comments that F\u00ebanor and his Silmarils relate to ''The Silmarillion''{{'}}s theme in a particular way: the sin of the elves is not human pride, as in the [[Fall of man|Biblical fall]], but their \"desire to make things which will forever reflect or incarnate their own personality\". This elvish form of pride leads F\u00ebanor to forge the Silmarils, and, Shippey suggests, led Tolkien to write his fictions: \"Tolkien could not help seeing a part of himself in F\u00ebanor and [[Saruman]], sharing their perhaps licit, perhaps illicit desire to 'sub-create'.\"<ref name=\"Shippey 1982 Pride and Possessiveness\">{{cite book |last=Shippey |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Shippey |title=The Road to Middle-Earth |date=1982 |publisher=Grafton (HarperCollins) |isbn=0261102753 |pages=213\u2013216}}</ref>\n\nThe critic [[Jane Chance Nitzsche]] sees F\u00ebanor's pride as more simply Biblical, writing that Morgoth's corruption of elves and men \"mirrors that of [[Adam and Eve]] by [[Satan]]; the desire for power and godlike being is the same desire for knowledge of good and evil witnessed in the [[Garden of Eden]].\"<ref name=\"Nitzsche 1980\">{{cite book |last=Nitzsche |first=Jane Chance |authorlink=Jane Chance |title=Tolkien's Art |date=1980 |origyear=1979 |publisher=Papermac |isbn=0-333-29034-8 |pages=131\u2013133}}</ref> She treats the Silmarils as symbols of that desire, identifying F\u00ebanor's wish to be like the Valar in creating \"things of his own\" as rebellious pride, and pointing out that his rebellion is echoed by that of the [[Numenorean]] man Ar-Pharazon, and then at the end of ''The Silmarillion'' by the (angelic) [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]], [[Sauron]], who becomes the Dark Lord of ''Lord of the Rings''.<ref name=\"Nitzsche 1980\"/>\n\nThe philologist [[Elizabeth Solopova]] suggests that the character of F\u00ebanor was inspired by [[Byrhtnoth]] from the Anglo-Saxon poem \"[[The Battle of Maldon]]\" who is slain in battle. Tolkien has described Byrhtnoth as misled by \"pride and misplaced chivalry proven fatal\" and as \"too foolish to be heroic\",<ref>''The Tolkien Reader'', p. 4, 22</ref> and F\u00ebanor is driven by \"overmastering pride\" that causes his own death and that of countless followers.<ref>{{ME-ref|Solopova|p. 42}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Feanor.gif|frame|Heraldic device of F\u00ebanor]]\n\nF\u00ebanor is among those major characters whom Tolkien, who also used to illustrate his writings, supplied with a distinct [[heraldry|heraldic device]].<ref>{{cite book |title=J.

F\u00ebanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized Silmarils, named Melkor \"Morgoth\", or \"Black Foe of the World\" (literally \"Black Enemy\"). Now King of the Noldor in Tirion, F\u00ebanor delivered the most impassioned speech ever given in Arda, which he unwittingly filled with Morgoth's corruption. He railed against the Great Enemy, but because of Morgoth's influence, he also blamed the Valar for Morgoth's deeds. He persuaded most of his people that because the Valar had abandoned them, the Noldor must follow him to [[Middle-earth]] to wrest the Silmarils back from Morgoth and avenge Finw\u00eb.  He declared that even if the Noldor ever managed to recover the Silmarils, he would never give them to the Valar to help recreate the Two Trees.  F\u00ebanor then swore an oath which all seven of his sons also proclaimed, vowing to fight anyone and everyone\u2014whether [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]], [[Man (Middle-earth)|Man]], [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]], or Vala\u2014who withheld the Silmarils, swearing upon [[Il\u00favatar]] himself, and invoking the chief of the Valar and the mountains of Valinor themselves as witnesses. This became known as the '''Oath of F\u00ebanor''' and, later, the cause for great tragedy on Middle-earth, particularly among his seven sons.\n\n{{quote|text=They swore an oath which none shall break, and none should take, by the name even of Il\u00favatar, calling the Everlasting Dark upon them if they kept it not... ...vowing to pursue with vengeance and hatred to the ends of the World Vala, Demon, Elf or Man as yet unborn or any creature, great or small, good or evil, that time should bring forth unto the end of days, whoso should hold or take or keep a Silmaril from their possession. \u2014 ''Quenta Silmarillion''}}\n\nThe oath commanded F\u00ebanor to press to Middle-earth and resulted in the first Kinslaying at the havens of the Teleri. F\u00ebanor died soon after his return to Middle-earth but the remaining oath-takers, his sons, lived on in relative harmony with the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] of [[Beleriand]]. For the greater part of the [[First Age]] the oath kept the sons of F\u00ebanor united in one cause to defeat Morgoth and retrieve the jewels.\n\nHowever, the true dangers of the oath became apparent when the lovers [[Beren]] and [[L\u00fathien]] recovered one of the jewels from Morgoth, which ultimately came into the possession of Dior, their son, who ruled after his grandfather [[Thingol]] in [[Menegroth]]. The presence of the Silmaril awoke the oath and caused the brothers to make war on the Elves of [[Doriath]] because Dior refused to yield the jewel. The brothers attacked Doriath, killed Dior and sacked the halls of the [[Sindar]], committing the second Kinslaying. However, the Silmaril escaped the destruction of Doriath and the oath drove the sons onwards. When they learned that it was possessed by Elwing daughter of Dior, who dwelt near the mouths of [[River Sirion|Sirion]] together with exiles from Doriath and the city of [[Gondolin]], they attacked the place (after Elwing also refused to return the Silmaril to them), committing the third and most terrible Kinslaying. All six of the remaining brothers survived even the complete rout of their forces at the N\u00edrnaeth Arnoediad, but three of the brothers\u2014Celegorm, Curufin, and Caranthir\u2014died in the second sacking of Menegroth. At the third and final Kinslaying, Amras was slain.\n\nThe fate of another brother, Amrod, varies by source. In the published Silmarillion, Amrod dies at Sirion with his brother. In subsequently published material, he dies much sooner as part of an accident that occurs when his father burns the stolen Teleri ships at Losgar.\n\nBut the Silmaril escaped them again and was borne by [[E\u00e4rendil]] into the West. That Silmaril was lost to the sons of F\u00ebanor but two more remained inside the crown of Morgoth. So after the [[War of Wrath]] the two remaining oath-takers, [[Maedhros]] and Maglor, stole the two Silmarils from the camp of the victorious West (the other five brothers were dead by this time). However, due to the terrible deeds committed by the brothers in their retrieval of the Silmarils they found they could not handle the Silmarils without enduring searing pain. The two brothers parted: in their anguish Maedhros threw himself and his Silmaril into a fiery chasm, and Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Maglor would spend eternity wandering the shore, lamenting his fate (though in Tolkien's final words on the subject, Maglor cast himself with his Silmaril into the sea).\n\nTolkien wrote at least four versions of the oath itself, as found in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]].'' The three earliest versions are found in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'': In [[alliterative verse]] (circa 1918\u20131920s), in chapter 2, \"Poems Early Abandoned\". ''The Flight of the Noldoli from Valinor''. Lines 132\u2013141. In rhyming [[couplets]] (circa 1928), in chapter 3, \"[[The Lay of Leithian]]\". Canto VI, lines 1628\u20131643. In a different form as restated by Celegorm, third son of F\u00ebanor, in chapter 3, \"The Lay of Leithian.\" Canto VI, lines 1848\u20131857. A later version is found in ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\nThe Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] comments that F\u00ebanor and his Silmarils relate to ''The Silmarillion''{{'}}s theme in a particular way: the sin of the elves is not human pride, as in the [[Fall of man|Biblical fall]], but their \"desire to make things which will forever reflect or incarnate their own personality\". This elvish form of pride leads F\u00ebanor to forge the Silmarils, and, Shippey suggests, led Tolkien to write his fictions: \"Tolkien could not help seeing a part of himself in F\u00ebanor and [[Saruman]], sharing their perhaps licit, perhaps illicit desire to 'sub-create'.\"<ref name=\"Shippey 1982 Pride and Possessiveness\">{{cite book |last=Shippey |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Shippey |title=The Road to Middle-Earth |date=1982 |publisher=Grafton (HarperCollins) |isbn=0261102753 |pages=213\u2013216}}</ref>\n\nThe critic [[Jane Chance Nitzsche]] sees F\u00ebanor's pride as more simply Biblical, writing that Morgoth's corruption of elves and men \"mirrors that of [[Adam and Eve]] by [[Satan]]; the desire for power and godlike being is the same desire for knowledge of good and evil witnessed in the [[Garden of Eden]].\"<ref name=\"Nitzsche 1980\">{{cite book |last=Nitzsche |first=Jane Chance |authorlink=Jane Chance |title=Tolkien's Art |date=1980 |origyear=1979 |publisher=Papermac |isbn=0-333-29034-8 |pages=131\u2013133}}</ref> She treats the Silmarils as symbols of that desire, identifying F\u00ebanor's wish to be like the Valar in creating \"things of his own\" as rebellious pride, and pointing out that his rebellion is echoed by that of the [[Numenorean]] man Ar-Pharazon, and then at the end of ''The Silmarillion'' by the (angelic) [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]], [[Sauron]], who becomes the Dark Lord of ''Lord of the Rings''.<ref name=\"Nitzsche 1980\"/>\n\nThe philologist [[Elizabeth Solopova]] suggests that the character of F\u00ebanor was inspired by [[Byrhtnoth]] from the Anglo-Saxon poem \"[[The Battle of Maldon]]\" who is slain in battle. Tolkien has described Byrhtnoth as misled by \"pride and misplaced chivalry proven fatal\" and as \"too foolish to be heroic\",<ref>''The Tolkien Reader'', p. 4, 22</ref> and F\u00ebanor is driven by \"overmastering pride\" that causes his own death and that of countless followers.<ref>{{ME-ref|Solopova|p. 42}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Feanor.gif|frame|Heraldic device of F\u00ebanor]]\n\nF\u00ebanor is among those major characters whom Tolkien, who also used to illustrate his writings, supplied with a distinct [[heraldry|heraldic device]].<ref>{{cite book |title=J.

They first landed at [[Negeri Sembilan|Sungai Ujong]]. Around late 1820's Datuk Balang and his Batang Kapas followers as well as a number of Payakumbuh peoples from Negeri Sembilan move north to [[Klang Valley|Kelang]] to open a new settlement at the northern [[Kuala Lumpur|Ulu Kelang (Kuala Lumpur)]], now known as [[Gombak District|Gombak]].

They first landed at [[Negeri Sembilan|Sungai Ujong]]. Around late 1820's Datuk Balang and his Batang Kapas followers as well as a number of Payakumbuh peoples from Negeri Sembilan move north to [[Klang Valley|Kelang]] to open a new settlement at the northern [[Kuala Lumpur|Ulu Kelang (Kuala Lumpur)]], now known as [[Gombak District|Gombak]].
