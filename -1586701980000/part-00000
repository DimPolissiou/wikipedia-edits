It was alleged by WW-2 U.S. Army divisions in Africa that overtook German infantry vehicles (mostly of the original Volkswagen design) that the Germans employed \"engine oil\" that is now known as STP formulation full-strength in the VW air-cooled 4-cylinder engines, which successfully traveled through the hot African Desert war-front without seizing  due to friction and extreme heat.

However, Studebaker-Packard CEO [[Sherwood Egbert]] felt that STP could one day outpace its parent company and recruited [[Andy Granatelli]] as the [[CEO]] of STP to help raise the product\u2019s image. At the same time, Granatelli became the public face of STP, often wearing a white suit emblazoned with the red oval STP logo to races, distributing thousands of all-weather STP stickers. Granatelli ran two Novi specials at the [[1964 Indianapolis 500]]. [[Jim Hurtubise]] and [[Bobby Unser]] were the drivers. There was a film made of the race centering on the Novis.\n\nWhen [[Studebaker]] abandoned auto manufacturing in 1966 to become [[Studebaker-Worthington]], STP sales continued to climb to the point where it was spun off into a publicly traded company in 1969. In 1976, it was acquired by [[JBS USA|Esmark]] which itself was purchased by [[Beatrice Foods]] in 1984. Beatrice sold STP to [[Union Carbide]] the next year.

{"title_page": "Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano", "text_new": "The '''''Trio pour hautbois, basson et piano''''' ('''Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano'''), [[FP (Poulenc)|FP]] 43, by [[Francis Poulenc]] is a three-movement [[chamber music|chamber work]], composed between 1924 and 1926, and premiered in the latter year.\n\nThe Trio was well-received at its premiere in Paris, with the composer at the piano. It has been performed and recorded frequently since. Critics have praised the work's depth of feeling, noting touches of Mozartian flavour and echoes of other composers' styles. It is regarded as the first major chamber work by Poulenc.\n\n== Background and first performance ==\nBy 1924 the 25-year-old Poulenc had become fairly well known in France, and to some extent elsewhere. First as a member of [[Les Six]] around the start of the decade, and then with his music for the ballet ''[[Les biches]]'' in 1924, he had established himself as a rising young composer.<ref>Hell (1959), pp. 17\u201321 and 28</ref> He had composed several chamber works, including the [[Sonata for clarinet and bassoon]] and the [[Sonata for horn, trumpet and trombone]] (both 1922),<ref>Nichols, p. 348</ref> and he began work on a trio for oboe, bassoon and piano in May 1924.<ref name=n62/>{{refn|Ideas for the trio had begun to form in his mind as early as 1921.<ref name=ns>Simeone, Nigel (2020). Notes to Resonus CD RES10256</ref>|group=n}} He was a slow and painstaking composer, and the piece took him two years to complete.<ref name =n62>Nichols, p. 62</ref> Finally he retreated to a hotel in [[Cannes]] to isolate himself from family and friends while he finished the work. While there he met [[Igor Stravinsky]] who gave him some good advice (\"quelques bons conseils\") that helped him with the final version of the first movement of the new piece.<ref>Car\u00e9, pp. 11\u201312</ref>\n\nPoulenc dedicated the Trio to [[Manuel de Falla]], who was delighted with the work and promised to organise and take part in a performance in Spain as soon as possible.<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 12</ref> The first performance of the Trio was given at the Salle des Agriculteurs in Paris on 2 May 1926 in a concert at which two other Poulenc works, ''Napoli'' and ''[[Chansons gaillardes]]'', were also premiered.<ref name=n71>Nichols, p. 71</ref>{{refn|''Napoli'' was played by [[Marcelle Meyer]] and the chansons were sung by [[Pierre Bernac]].<ref name=n71/>|group=n}} The work was given again the following day.<ref name=men>\"Concerts de la Revue Musicale\", ''[[Le M\u00e9nestrel]]'', 14 May 1926, p. 223</ref>  The players were Roger Lamorlette (oboe), Gustave Dh\u00e9rin (bassoon) and the composer (piano).<ref>Schmidt, p. 149</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nThe Trio is in three movements \u2013 [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Presto]], [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Andante]] and [[Rondo]].

He preferred what he called an \"episodic\" style, in which a theme is presented with no development and is followed by a contrasting theme, similarly treated.<ref>Nichols, p. 64</ref> Nevertheless, many years after the work was written, Poulenc told [[Claude Rostand]]:\n{{blockindent|For those who think I don't care about form, I've no objection to unveiling my secrets here: the first movement follows the plan of a [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] Allegro, and the final Rondo the shape of the scherzo in [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Second Piano Concerto]]. [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] always recommended this method to me, which he often followed himself.<ref>Poulenc and Southon, p. 240</ref>|}}\nIn a 1998 study of Poulenc, Keith Daniel suggests that this ''ex post facto'' analysis by  Poulenc was to some extent myth-making \u2013 something he was given to.<ref name=n65/> [[Roger Nichols (musical scholar)|Roger Nichols]] (2020) concurs and considers the most striking feature of the Trio is its depth of feeling, \"especially in the central Andante where, in his favourite B flat major and over a continuously pulsing [[eighth note|quaver]] movement, he gives full rein to his lyrical gifts\".<ref name=n65>Nichols, p. 65</ref> Poulenc's biographer [[Henri Hell]] comments that several themes recall [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], notably the first bars of the Andante.<ref>Hell (1978), p. 82</ref>\n\n=== I: Presto ===\nBefore the presto begins there is a slow (\u2669 = 76) 15-bar introduction in {{music|time|4|4}} time. First, the piano is heard in a series of bare chords; the bassoon joins in the fourth bar and the oboe in the eighth. The analyst Claude Car\u00e9 likens the introduction to \"a very grand centuries-old portico\", [[Wilfrid Mellers]] calls it \"quasi-[[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lullian]]\"<ref name=m14>Mellers, p. 14</ref> and both Hell and Nichols find clear echoes of the ceremonious [[French overture]] and \"the [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] of [[Louis XIV]]\".<ref>Hell (1978), p. 83; and Nichols, p. 64</ref> Mellers finds \"a Stravinskian starkness\" in the introduction, and Hell comments that one can never be sure whether its tone is grave or wry.<ref>Mellers, 14; and Hell (1959), p. 33</ref> The presto ([[minim (music)|minim]] =104) begins with a [[Classical period (music)|classically]] [[dotted note|double-dotted]] theme for the bassoon in B-flat minor, echoed by the oboe, a [[semitone]] higher.

The opening theme, in B-flat major is a gentle {{music|time|4|8}} tune. There are further echoes of Gluck, with a quotation from his \"[[The Dance of the Blessed Spirits|Dance of the Blessed Spirits]]\".<ref name=m15>Mellers, p. 15</ref> The oboe has a melody of \"melancholy grace\".<ref>Hell (1978),  p. 83</ref> The mood becomes less idyllic towards the end of the movement: in Mellers's words, \"the delights of pastoral F major [become] shadowed with chromatics\", and the final chord is in F minor, a key associated with [[dirges]].<ref name=m15/>\n\n===III: Rondo ===\nThe last movement (\u2669. = 138\u2013144) is marked \"tr\u00e8s vif\" \u2013 very lively. The music maintains what Car\u00e9 calls a frenzy of movement (\"fr\u00e9n\u00e9sie du mouvement\"),<ref name=c14>Car\u00e9, p. 14</ref> the piano playing without a single bar's rest, and the \"ironic voice\" of the oboe contrasting with the bassoon.<ref name=h84>Hell (1978), p. 84</ref> The impetus continues unflaggingly throughout: Poulenc instructs the players not to slow down in the closing bars (\"sans ralentir\"). Mellers comments that this finale has affinities with a baroque French gigue, an [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] [[galop]], and \u2013 \"in the tight Stravinskian coda \u2013 the acerbity of post-war Paris\".<ref name=m15/>\n\n== Reception  ==\n''[[Le M\u00e9nestrel]]'' said after the second performance:\n{{blockindent|A second hearing \u2026 allowed us to grasp, even more than at the premiere \u2013 and especially during the Andante and the Rondo \u2013 a rare delicacy of instrumentation, as well as the subtlety with which the composer has solved problems of form both melodically and from an instrumental or formal point of view, with a feigned negligence that disguises the completeness of his craft.{{refn|Une seconde audition \u2026 permettait d'y saisir, encore plus qu'\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re, et plus particuli\u00e8rement au cours de l'Andante et du Rondo,!a rare d\u00e9licatesse de l'instrumentation, ainsi que la subtilit\u00e9 de certains probl\u00e8mes de forme r\u00e9solus par l'auteur: tant m\u00e9lodiquement que du point de vue instrumental ou formel, toujours une feinte n\u00e9gligence n'y fait que couvrir cette pl\u00e9nitude du m\u00e9tier \u2026<ref name=men/>|group=n}}|}}\nHell calls the Trio the composer's first major achievement in the sphere of chamber music,<ref>Hell (1959), p. 32</ref> and praises \"the perfect coherence of its construction\" and its \"innate equilibrium\".<ref name=h84/> Poulenc was famously self-critical,<ref>Deeter and Peavler, p. 3; and Poulenc and Southon, p. 241</ref> but looking back in the 1950s he said \"I'm rather fond of my Trio because it sounds clear, and it is well balanced.\" He also noted with satisfaction that the energetic finale was always followed by sustained applause (\"applaudissements nourris\").<ref name=c14/> In the last year of his life, after hearing a performance, he wrote that the work \"retained an extraordinary fresh force and fantastic individuality\".<ref name=m14/> Mellers echoed Poulenc's words, writing that thirty years later the music still retained those qualities; \"this music is tonic to ageing minds and senses\".<ref name=m14/>\n\n==Recordings==\nLamorlee, Dh\u00e9rin and the composer recorded the work for French Columbia in 1928 \u2013 one of Poulenc\u2019s earliest records.
