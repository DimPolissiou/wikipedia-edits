PID can cause serious problems during pregnancy and even has the potential to cause infertility. It can cause a woman to have a potentially deadly [[ectopic pregnancy]], in which the egg implants outside of the uterus. However, Chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics.\n* The two most common forms of [[herpes]] are caused by infection with [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV). HSV-1 is typically acquired orally and causes cold sores, HSV-2 is usually acquired during sexual contact and affects the genitals, however either strain may affect either site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/genital-herpes/guide/genital-herpes-basics|title=The Basics of Genital Herpes|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922132912/http://www.webmd.com/genital-herpes/guide/genital-herpes-basics|archivedate=2014-09-22|df=}}</ref> Some people are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. Those that do experience symptoms usually notice them 2 to 20 days after exposure which last 2 to 4 weeks. Symptoms can include small fluid-filled blisters, headaches, backaches, itching or tingling sensations in the genital or anal area, pain during urination, [[Flu like symptoms]], swollen glands, or fever. Herpes is spread through skin contact with a person infected with the virus. The virus affects the areas where it entered the body. This can occur through kissing, vaginal intercourse, oral sex or anal sex. The virus is most infectious during times when there are visible symptoms, however those who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus through skin contact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/herpes.htm|title=Herpes|publisher=Avert.org|accessdate=2013-06-30|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704200815/http://www.avert.org/herpes.htm|archivedate=2013-07-04|df=}}</ref> The initial infection and symptoms are usually the most severe because the body does not have any antibodies built up. After the primary attack, one might have recurring attacks that are milder or might not even have future attacks. There is no cure for the disease but there are antiviral medications that treat its symptoms and lower the risk of transmission ([[Valaciclovir|Valtrex]]). Although HSV-1 is typically the \"oral\" version of the virus, and HSV-2 is typically the \"genital\" version of the virus, a person with HSV-1 orally CAN transmit that virus to their partner genitally. The virus, either type, will settle into a nerve bundle either at the top of the spine, producing the \"oral\" outbreak, or a second nerve bundle at the base of the spine, producing the genital outbreak.\n* The [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) is the most common STI in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/human-papillomavirus-hpv.html |title=Human Papillomavirus (HPV) &#124; Overview |publisher=FamilyDoctor.org |date=2010-12-01 |accessdate=2013-06-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703081608/http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/human-papillomavirus-hpv.html |archivedate=2013-07-03 |df= }}</ref> There are more than 40 different strands of HPV and many do not cause any health problems.

Symptoms might not show up until advanced stages. It is important for women to get pap smears in order to check for and treat cancers. There are also two vaccines available for women ([[Cervarix]] and [[Gardasil]]) that protect against the types of HPV that cause cervical cancer. HPV can be passed through genital-to-genital contact as well as during oral sex. It is important to remember that the infected partner might not have any symptoms.\n* [[Gonorrhea]] is caused by bacterium that lives on moist mucous membranes in the urethra, vagina, rectum, mouth, throat, and eyes. The infection can spread through contact with the penis, vagina, mouth or anus. Symptoms of gonorrhea usually appear 2 to 5 days after contact with an infected partner however, some men might not notice symptoms for up to a month. Symptoms in men include burning and pain while urinating, increased urinary frequency, discharge from the penis (white, green, or yellow in color), red or swollen urethra, swollen or tender testicles, or sore throat. Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge, burning or itching while urinating, painful sexual intercourse, severe pain in lower abdomen (if infection spreads to fallopian tubes), or fever (if infection spreads to fallopian tubes); however, many women do not show any symptoms.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|007267|Gonorrhea}}</ref> There are some antibiotic resistant strains for Gonorrhea but most cases can be cured with antibiotics.\n\n[[File:SyphilistischeZiekten.jpg|thumb|right|Secondary syphilis]]\n* [[Syphilis]] is an STI caused by a bacterium.

The stages include [[Acute HIV Infection|primary infection]], asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and AIDS. In the primary infection stage, an individual will have flu like symptoms (headache, fatigue, fever, muscle aches) for about 2 weeks. In the asymptomatic stage, symptoms usually disappear, and the patient can remain asymptomatic for years. When HIV progresses to the symptomatic stage, the immune system is weakened, and has a low cell count of CD4+ [[T Cells]]. When the HIV infection becomes life-threatening, it is called AIDS. People with AIDS fall prey to opportunistic infections and die as a result.<ref name=\"King, B. 2009\"/> When the disease was first discovered in the 1980s, those who had AIDS were not likely to live longer than a few years. There are now antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) available to treat HIV infections. There is no known cure for HIV or AIDS but the drugs help suppress the virus. By suppressing the amount of virus in the body, people can lead longer and healthier lives. Even though their virus levels may be low they can still spread the virus to others.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/hivaids/understanding/treatment/pages/default.aspx |title=HIV/AIDS Treatment |publisher=Niaid.nih.gov |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2013-06-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703101033/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/hivaids/understanding/treatment/pages/default.aspx |archivedate=2013-07-03 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Viruses in semen===\n\nTwenty-seven different viruses have been identified in semen.

Mucous membranes differ from [[skin]] in that they allow certain pathogens into the body. The amount of contact with infective sources which causes infection varies with each pathogen but in all cases, a disease may result from even light contact from fluid carriers like venereal fluids onto a mucous membrane.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nSome STIs such as HIV can be transmitted from mother to child either during pregnancy or breastfeeding.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nHealthcare professionals suggest [[safer sex]], such as the use of [[condom]]s, as a reliable way of decreasing the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases during sexual activity, but safer sex cannot be considered to provide complete protection from an STI. The transfer of and exposure to bodily fluids, such as [[blood transfusion]]s and other blood products, sharing injection [[Intravenous therapy|needles]], needle-stick injuries (when medical staff are inadvertently jabbed or pricked with needles during medical procedures), sharing [[tattoo]] needles, and childbirth are other avenues of transmission. These different means put certain groups, such as medical workers, and [[haemophilia]]cs and drug users, particularly at risk.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIt is possible to be an [[symptom|asymptomatic]] carrier of sexually transmitted diseases. In particular, sexually transmitted diseases in women often cause the serious condition of pelvic inflammatory disease.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\n[[File:STILL AT THE TOP OF THE SICK LIST - NARA - 515490.tif|thumb|right|[[World War II]] US Army poster warning of venereal disease]]\n\n[[medical test|Testing]] may be for a single infection, or consist of a number of tests for a range of STIs, including tests for [[syphilis]], [[trichomonas]], gonorrhea, [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[herpes]], [[hepatitis]] and [[HIV test|HIV]]. No procedure tests for all infectious agents.\n\nSTI tests may be used for a number of reasons:\n* as a [[diagnostic test]] to determine the cause of symptoms or illness\n* as a [[screening test]] to detect asymptomatic or presymptomatic [[infection]]s\n* as a check that prospective sexual partners are free of disease before they engage in sex without [[safer sex]] precautions (for example, when starting a long term mutually monogamous sexual relationship, in [[Fluid bonding (sexual practice)|fluid bonding]], or for procreation).\n* as a check prior to or during pregnancy, to prevent harm to the baby\n* as a check after birth, to check that the baby has not caught an STI from the mother\n* to prevent the use of infected [[blood donation|donated blood]] or [[organ donation|organs]]\n* as part of the process of [[contact tracing]] from a known infected individual\n* as part of mass [[epidemiological]] surveillance\n\nEarly identification and treatment results in less chance to spread disease, and for some conditions may improve the outcomes of treatment. There is often a [[window period]] after initial infection during which an STI test will be negative. During this period, the infection may be transmissible. The duration of this period varies depending on the infection and the test. Diagnosis may also be delayed by reluctance of the infected person to seek a medical professional.

Most of the time, people do not know that they are infected with an STI until they are tested or start showing symptoms of disease. Moreover, the term ''sexually transmissible disease'' is sometimes used since it is less restrictive in consideration of other factors or means of transmission. For instance, [[meningitis]] is transmissible by means of sexual contact but is not labeled an STI because sexual contact is not the primary [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for the [[pathogen]]s that cause meningitis. This discrepancy is addressed by the probability of infection by means ''other than sexual contact''. In general, an STI is an infection that has a negligible probability of transmission by means other than sexual contact, but has a realistic means of transmission by sexual contact (more sophisticated means\u2014[[blood transfusion]], sharing of [[hypodermic needle]]s\u2014are not taken into account). Thus, one may presume that, if a person is infected with an STI, e.g., [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], [[genital herpes]], [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]] it was transmitted to him/her by means of sexual contact.-->\n\n== Prevention ==\n{{Main|Safe sex}}\nStrategies for reducing STI risk include:  vaccination, [[mutual monogamy]], reducing the number of sexual partners, and abstinence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm|title=How You Can Prevent Sexually Transmitted Diseases|last=|first=|date=31 March 2016|website=|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=13 December 2017}}</ref> Behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults who are at increased risk.<ref>{{cite web |title=Draft Recommendation Statement: Sexually Transmitted Infections: Behavioral Counseling - US Preventive Services Task Force |url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/draft-recommendation-statement/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling2 |website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org |accessdate=19 December 2019}}</ref> Such interactive counseling, which can be resource intensive, is directed at a person's risk, the situations in which risk occurs, and the use of personalized goal-setting strategies.<ref name = cdc2015/>\n\nThe most effective way to prevent sexual transmission of STIs is to avoid contact of body parts or fluids which can lead to transfer with an infected partner. Not all sexual activities involve contact: [[cybersex]], [[phonesex]] or [[masturbation]] from a distance are methods of avoiding contact. Proper use of condoms reduces contact and risk.

Many infections are not detectable immediately after exposure, so enough time must be allowed between possible exposures and testing for the tests to be accurate. Certain STIs, particularly certain persistent viruses like HPV, may be impossible to detect.{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nSome treatment facilities utilize in-home test kits and have the person return the test for follow-up. Other facilities strongly encourage that those previously infected return to ensure that the infection has been eliminated.

In 1924, a number of states concluded the [[Brussels Agreement (1924)|Brussels Agreement]], whereby states agreed to provide free or low-cost medical treatment at ports for merchant seamen with venereal diseases.\n\nThe first effective treatment for a sexually transmitted disease was [[Arsphenamine|salvarsan]], a treatment for syphilis. With the discovery of [[antibiotic]]s, a large number of sexually transmitted diseases became easily curable, and this, combined with effective public health campaigns against STIs, led to a public perception during the 1960s and 1970s that they have ceased to be a serious medical threat.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nDuring this period, the importance of [[contact tracing]] in treating STIs was recognized. By tracing the sexual partners of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn, STI clinics could effectively suppress infections in the general population.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn the 1980s, first genital herpes and then [[AIDS]] emerged into the public consciousness as sexually transmitted diseases that could not be cured by modern medicine.

It can cause a woman to have a potentially deadly [[ectopic pregnancy]], in which the egg implants outside of the uterus. However, Chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics.\n* The two most common forms of [[herpes]] are caused by infection with [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV). HSV-1 is typically acquired orally and causes cold sores, HSV-2 is usually acquired during sexual contact and affects the genitals, however either strain may affect either site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/genital-herpes/guide/genital-herpes-basics|title=The Basics of Genital Herpes|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922132912/http://www.webmd.com/genital-herpes/guide/genital-herpes-basics|archivedate=2014-09-22|df=}}</ref> Some people are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms.

Symptoms can include small fluid-filled blisters, headaches, backaches, itching or tingling sensations in the genital or anal area, pain during urination, [[Flu like symptoms]], swollen glands, or fever. Herpes is spread through skin contact with a person infected with the virus. The virus affects the areas where it entered the body. This can occur through kissing, vaginal intercourse, oral sex or anal sex. The virus is most infectious during times when there are visible symptoms, however those who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus through skin contact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/herpes.htm|title=Herpes|publisher=Avert.org|accessdate=2013-06-30|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704200815/http://www.avert.org/herpes.htm|archivedate=2013-07-04|df=}}</ref> The initial infection and symptoms are usually the most severe because the body does not have any antibodies built up. After the primary attack, one might have recurring attacks that are milder or might not even have future attacks. There is no cure for the disease but there are antiviral medications that treat its symptoms and lower the risk of transmission ([[Valaciclovir|Valtrex]]). Although HSV-1 is typically the \"oral\" version of the virus, and HSV-2 is typically the \"genital\" version of the virus, a person with HSV-1 orally CAN transmit that virus to their partner genitally. The virus, either type, will settle into a nerve bundle either at the top of the spine, producing the \"oral\" outbreak, or a second nerve bundle at the base of the spine, producing the genital outbreak.\n* The [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) is the most common STI in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/human-papillomavirus-hpv.html |title=Human Papillomavirus (HPV) &#124; Overview |publisher=FamilyDoctor.org |date=2010-12-01 |accessdate=2013-06-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703081608/http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/human-papillomavirus-hpv.html |archivedate=2013-07-03 |df= }}</ref> There are more than 40 different strands of HPV and many do not cause any health problems.

There are also two vaccines available for women ([[Cervarix]] and [[Gardasil]]) that protect against the types of HPV that cause cervical cancer. HPV can be passed through genital-to-genital contact as well as during oral sex. It is important to remember that the infected partner might not have any symptoms.\n* [[Gonorrhea]] is caused by bacterium that lives on moist mucous membranes in the urethra, vagina, rectum, mouth, throat, and eyes. The infection can spread through contact with the penis, vagina, mouth or anus. Symptoms of gonorrhea usually appear 2 to 5 days after contact with an infected partner however, some men might not notice symptoms for up to a month. Symptoms in men include burning and pain while urinating, increased urinary frequency, discharge from the penis (white, green, or yellow in color), red or swollen urethra, swollen or tender testicles, or sore throat. Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge, burning or itching while urinating, painful sexual intercourse, severe pain in lower abdomen (if infection spreads to fallopian tubes), or fever (if infection spreads to fallopian tubes); however, many women do not show any symptoms.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|007267|Gonorrhea}}</ref> There are some antibiotic resistant strains for Gonorrhea but most cases can be cured with antibiotics.\n\n[[File:SyphilistischeZiekten.jpg|thumb|right|Secondary syphilis]]\n* [[Syphilis]] is an STI caused by a bacterium.

The stages include [[Acute HIV Infection|primary infection]], asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and AIDS. In the primary infection stage, an individual will have flu like symptoms (headache, fatigue, fever, muscle aches) for about 2 weeks. In the asymptomatic stage, symptoms usually disappear, and the patient can remain asymptomatic for years. When HIV progresses to the symptomatic stage, the immune system is weakened, and has a low cell count of CD4+ [[T Cells]]. When the HIV infection becomes life-threatening, it is called AIDS. People with AIDS fall prey to opportunistic infections and die as a result.<ref name=\"King, B. 2009\"/> When the disease was first discovered in the 1980s, those who had AIDS were not likely to live longer than a few years. There are now antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) available to treat HIV infections. There is no known cure for HIV or AIDS but the drugs help suppress the virus. By suppressing the amount of virus in the body, people can lead longer and healthier lives.

Mucous membranes differ from [[skin]] in that they allow certain pathogens into the body. The amount of contact with infective sources which causes infection varies with each pathogen but in all cases, a disease may result from even light contact from fluid carriers like venereal fluids onto a mucous membrane.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nSome STIs such as HIV can be transmitted from mother to child either during pregnancy or breastfeeding.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nHealthcare professionals suggest [[safer sex]], such as the use of [[condom]]s, as a reliable way of decreasing the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases during sexual activity, but safer sex cannot be considered to provide complete protection from an STI. The transfer of and exposure to bodily fluids, such as [[blood transfusion]]s and other blood products, sharing injection [[Intravenous therapy|needles]], needle-stick injuries (when medical staff are inadvertently jabbed or pricked with needles during medical procedures), sharing [[tattoo]] needles, and childbirth are other avenues of transmission. These different means put certain groups, such as medical workers, and [[haemophilia]]cs and drug users, particularly at risk.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIt is possible to be an [[symptom|asymptomatic]] carrier of sexually transmitted diseases. In particular, sexually transmitted diseases in women often cause the serious condition of pelvic inflammatory disease.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\n[[File:STILL AT THE TOP OF THE SICK LIST - NARA - 515490.tif|thumb|right|[[World War II]] US Army poster warning of venereal disease]]\n\n[[medical test|Testing]] may be for a single infection, or consist of a number of tests for a range of STIs, including tests for [[syphilis]], [[trichomonas]], gonorrhea, [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[herpes]], [[hepatitis]] and [[HIV test|HIV]]. No procedure tests for all infectious agents.\n\nSTI tests may be used for a number of reasons:\n* as a [[diagnostic test]] to determine the cause of symptoms or illness\n* as a [[screening test]] to detect asymptomatic or presymptomatic [[infection]]s\n* as a check that prospective sexual partners are free of disease before they engage in sex without [[safer sex]] precautions (for example, when starting a long term mutually monogamous sexual relationship, in [[Fluid bonding (sexual practice)|fluid bonding]], or for procreation).\n* as a check prior to or during pregnancy, to prevent harm to the baby\n* as a check after birth, to check that the baby has not caught an STI from the mother\n* to prevent the use of infected [[blood donation|donated blood]] or [[organ donation|organs]]\n* as part of the process of [[contact tracing]] from a known infected individual\n* as part of mass [[epidemiological]] surveillance\n\nEarly identification and treatment results in less chance to spread disease, and for some conditions may improve the outcomes of treatment. There is often a [[window period]] after initial infection during which an STI test will be negative. During this period, the infection may be transmissible. The duration of this period varies depending on the infection and the test. Diagnosis may also be delayed by reluctance of the infected person to seek a medical professional.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has recommended the more inclusive term ''sexually transmitted infection'' since 1999.<ref name=WHO2003Term/> [[Public health]] officials originally introduced the term ''sexually transmitted infection'', which clinicians are increasingly using alongside the term ''sexually transmitted disease'' in order to distinguish it from the former.<ref>{{cite book|author=K.

Most of the time, people do not know that they are infected with an STI until they are tested or start showing symptoms of disease. Moreover, the term ''sexually transmissible disease'' is sometimes used since it is less restrictive in consideration of other factors or means of transmission. For instance, [[meningitis]] is transmissible by means of sexual contact but is not labeled an STI because sexual contact is not the primary [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for the [[pathogen]]s that cause meningitis. This discrepancy is addressed by the probability of infection by means ''other than sexual contact''. In general, an STI is an infection that has a negligible probability of transmission by means other than sexual contact, but has a realistic means of transmission by sexual contact (more sophisticated means\u2014[[blood transfusion]], sharing of [[hypodermic needle]]s\u2014are not taken into account). Thus, one may presume that, if a person is infected with an STI, e.g., [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], [[genital herpes]], [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]] it was transmitted to him/her by means of sexual contact.-->\n\n== Prevention ==\n{{Main|Safe sex}}\nStrategies for reducing STI risk include:  vaccination, [[mutual monogamy]], reducing the number of sexual partners, and abstinence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm|title=How You Can Prevent Sexually Transmitted Diseases|last=|first=|date=31 March 2016|website=|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=13 December 2017}}</ref> Behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults who are at increased risk.<ref>{{cite web |title=Draft Recommendation Statement: Sexually Transmitted Infections: Behavioral Counseling - US Preventive Services Task Force |url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/draft-recommendation-statement/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling2 |website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org |accessdate=19 December 2019}}</ref> Such interactive counseling, which can be resource intensive, is directed at a person's risk, the situations in which risk occurs, and the use of personalized goal-setting strategies.<ref name = cdc2015/>\n\nThe most effective way to prevent sexual transmission of STIs is to avoid contact of body parts or fluids which can lead to transfer with an infected partner. Not all sexual activities involve contact: [[cybersex]], [[phonesex]] or [[masturbation]] from a distance are methods of avoiding contact. Proper use of condoms reduces contact and risk. Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom.<ref>{{cite web |last=Villhauer |first=Tanya |title=Condoms Preventing HPV? |publisher=University of Iowa Student Health Service/Health Iowa |date=2005-05-20 |url=http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |accessdate=2009-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314084306/http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |archivedate=14 March 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\nBoth partners can get tested for STIs before initiating sexual contact, or before resuming contact if a partner engaged in contact with someone else. Many infections are not detectable immediately after exposure, so enough time must be allowed between possible exposures and testing for the tests to be accurate. Certain STIs, particularly certain persistent viruses like HPV, may be impossible to detect.{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nSome treatment facilities utilize in-home test kits and have the person return the test for follow-up. Other facilities strongly encourage that those previously infected return to ensure that the infection has been eliminated. Novel strategies to foster re-testing have been the use of text messaging and email as reminders. These types of reminders are now used in addition to phone calls and letters.<ref name=\"DesaiWoodhall2015\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/sextrans-2014-051930 |pmid=25759476 |title=Active recall to increase HIV and STI testing: A systematic review |journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=314\u201323 |year=2015 |last1=Desai |first1=Monica |last2=Woodhall |first2=Sarah C |last3=Nardone |first3=Anthony |last4=Burns |first4=Fiona |last5=Mercey |first5=Danielle |last6=Gilson |first6=Richard }}</ref> After obtaining a sexual history, a healthcare provider can encourage risk reduction by providing prevention [[counseling]].

An infected fluid to broken skin borne direct transmission of HIV would not be considered \"sexually transmitted\", but can still theoretically occur during sexual contact. This can be avoided simply by not engaging in sexual contact when presenting open, bleeding wounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nOther STIs, even viral infections, can be prevented with the use of latex, polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms as a barrier.

A new condom is used for each act of intercourse, as multiple usage increases the chance of breakage, defeating the effectiveness as a barrier.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn case of female condoms, the device consists of two rings, one in each terminal portion. The larger ring should fit snugly over the cervix and the smaller ring remains outside the vagina, covering the vulva.

The first voluntary hospital for venereal diseases was founded in 1746 at [[London Lock Hospital]].<ref name=\"AIM-Albert\">Archives in London and the M25 area ([http://www.aim25.ac.uk/index.stm AIM25] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410043108/http://www.aim25.ac.uk/index.stm |date=2006-04-10 }}) [http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=859&inst_id=9 London Lock Hospital records]</ref> Treatment was not always voluntary: in the second half of the 19th century, the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] were used to arrest suspected prostitutes. In 1924, a number of states concluded the [[Brussels Agreement (1924)|Brussels Agreement]], whereby states agreed to provide free or low-cost medical treatment at ports for merchant seamen with venereal diseases.\n\nThe first effective treatment for a sexually transmitted disease was [[Arsphenamine|salvarsan]], a treatment for syphilis. With the discovery of [[antibiotic]]s, a large number of sexually transmitted diseases became easily curable, and this, combined with effective public health campaigns against STIs, led to a public perception during the 1960s and 1970s that they have ceased to be a serious medical threat.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nDuring this period, the importance of [[contact tracing]] in treating STIs was recognized. By tracing the sexual partners of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn, STI clinics could effectively suppress infections in the general population.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn the 1980s, first genital herpes and then [[AIDS]] emerged into the public consciousness as sexually transmitted diseases that could not be cured by modern medicine.

The series were developed by [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Marc Guggenheim]], [[Andrew Kreisberg]], [[Geoff Johns]], [[Ali Adler]], [[Phil Klemmer]], [[Salim Akil]] and [[Caroline Dries]], and based on characters appearing in publications by [[DC Comics]]. Set in a [[shared fictional universe|shared fictional multiverse]] much like the [[DC Universe]] and [[DC Multiverse]] in comic books, it was established by [[fictional crossover|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters that span six live-action television series and two animated series.It is the best thing ever!\n\nThe franchise began with ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', based on the character [[Green Arrow]], which debuted in October 2012. It was followed by ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' in 2014, and the animated web-series ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]'' in 2015. The franchise was further expanded in 2016, when in January of that year a new series titled ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' debuted, starring characters that originally appeared on both ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash''. Later that year, the [[CBS]] series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', having already crossed-over with ''The Flash'', was moved to The CW for its second season, where it has remained since. A second animated web-series, ''[[Freedom Fighters: The Ray]]'', was released in 2017, which followed [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray Terrill / The Ray]], who would make a live-action appearance during that year's crossover event \"[[Crisis on Earth-X]]\". In addition to the live-action and web-based series, the franchise has spawned three promotional tie-in live-action web series, ''Blood Rush'', ''Chronicles of Cisco'', and ''The Flash: Stretched Scenes''; released in 2013, 2016, and 2017 respectively. A fifth series, ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'', premiered in 2019. Since 2014, there has been a yearly crossover event involving many of the live-action series of the Arrowverse. Additionally, [[Matt Ryan (actor)|Matt Ryan]] has reprised his role as [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]] from the [[NBC]] series ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'', initially in guest appearances in episodes of ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'', before becoming a series regular for the latter, in addition to continuing storylines from the former series.\n\nThe 2018 and 2019 crossovers, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\" and \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\", respectively, saw multiple DC television series and films be retroactively added to the franchise's multiverse. \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" also rebooted the multiverse, which saw ''Supergirl'' join the other live-action series on a new fictional earth along with the series ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'', which had previously been separate up to this point.

''Supergirl'' already has that problem built-in with Superman, who it seems will not be a regular fixture on the show, and I'm sure there will be many excuses as to why he's too busy to help Supergirl fight her latest battle. Add in ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' mythology, and it's probably too much to juggle....I think ''Supergirl'' deserves to launch without ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' on its shoulders, and be allowed to find itself before being assimilated into an existing universe.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/05/14/why-supergirl-shouldnt-join-the-flasharrowverse/#730b6ac65b57 |title=Why Supergirl Shouldn't Join The Flash/Arrowverse |last=Tassi |first=Paul |date=May 14, 2015 |website=[[Forbes]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130114227/http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/05/14/why-supergirl-shouldnt-join-the-flasharrowverse/ |archive-date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=January 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith the premiere of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ScreenRant's Alice Walker discussed how the series \"has hurt ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash''\", noting that the latter required minimal setup when it was spun-off from the former and had an element of mystery surrounding its quality with \"a \"wait and see\" attitude\" from audiences, while ''Legends'' was instead met with much excitement long before its release leading to each piece of news concerning it being \"publicized and met with fanfare \u2013 to the detriment of the other shows involved.\" Walker felt that audiences knowing which characters would appear in ''Legends'', and how, took \"the thrill out of the story\" of the other series as such information spoiled some of their upcoming plot twists, including the resurrection of Sara Lance or the fact that Ray Palmer \"could never really pose a threat to Oliver [Queen] and Felicity [Smoak]'s relationship, or run Palmer Technologies long term, since it was widely known that he would be a huge part of ''Legends''.\" Additionally, the annual ''Arrow''/''The Flash'' crossover suffered from also trying to set up ''Legends'', which was \"too much to ask from the already crowded storylines and ended up feeling like an exercise in synchronicity, with producers planting more seeds than they could reap. The crossover event was no longer a fun way to contrast the two shows; it now had to serve the much larger purpose of setting up an entirely new world.\" Walker stated that the premiere of ''Legends'' \"means that ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' can finally stop dedicating so much time and plot to laying the groundwork for the spin-off, and start focusing on the fundamentals of their own shows again.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-arrow-flash-plots/ |title=How Legends Of Tomorrow Has Hurt Arrow & The Flash |last=Walker |first=Alice |date=January 20, 2016 |website=ScreenRant |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408004114/http://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-arrow-flash-plots/ |archive-date=April 8, 2017 |access-date=January 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the \"Elseworlds\" crossover teased the comic ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' would be adapted in the 2019 crossover, Mike Cecchini of Den of Geek stated, \"The Arrowverse is becoming the most intricate, risky live action superhero universe in history.

various interconnected [[television series]] primarily airing on [[The CW]] and [[web series]] airing on [[CW Seed]]. The series were developed by [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Marc Guggenheim]], [[Andrew Kreisberg]], [[Geoff Johns]], [[Ali Adler]], [[Phil Klemmer]], [[Salim Akil]] and [[Caroline Dries]], and based on characters appearing in publications by [[DC Comics]]. Set in a [[shared fictional universe|shared fictional multiverse]] much like the [[DC Universe]] and [[DC Multiverse]] in comic books, it was established by [[fictional crossover|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters that span six live-action television series and two animated series.\n\nThe franchise began with ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', based on the character [[Green Arrow]], which debuted in October 2012. It was followed by ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' in 2014, and the animated web-series ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]'' in 2015. The franchise was further expanded in 2016, when in January of that year a new series titled ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' debuted, starring characters that originally appeared on both ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash''. Later that year, the [[CBS]] series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', having already crossed-over with ''The Flash'', was moved to The CW for its second season, where it has remained since. A second animated web-series, ''[[Freedom Fighters: The Ray]]'', was released in 2017, which followed [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray Terrill / The Ray]], who would make a live-action appearance during that year's crossover event \"[[Crisis on Earth-X]]\".

''Supergirl'' already has that problem built-in with Superman, who it seems will not be a regular fixture on the show, and I'm sure there will be many excuses as to why he's too busy to help Supergirl fight her latest battle. Add in ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' mythology, and it's probably too much to juggle....I think ''Supergirl'' deserves to launch without ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' on its shoulders, and be allowed to find itself before being assimilated into an existing universe.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/05/14/why-supergirl-shouldnt-join-the-flasharrowverse/#730b6ac65b57 |title=Why Supergirl Shouldn't Join The Flash/Arrowverse |last=Tassi |first=Paul |date=May 14, 2015 |website=[[Forbes]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130114227/http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/05/14/why-supergirl-shouldnt-join-the-flasharrowverse/ |archive-date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=January 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith the premiere of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ScreenRant's Alice Walker discussed how the series \"has hurt ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash''\", noting that the latter required minimal setup when it was spun-off from the former and had an element of mystery surrounding its quality with \"a \"wait and see\" attitude\" from audiences, while ''Legends'' was instead met with much excitement long before its release leading to each piece of news concerning it being \"publicized and met with fanfare \u2013 to the detriment of the other shows involved.\" Walker felt that audiences knowing which characters would appear in ''Legends'', and how, took \"the thrill out of the story\" of the other series as such information spoiled some of their upcoming plot twists, including the resurrection of Sara Lance or the fact that Ray Palmer \"could never really pose a threat to Oliver [Queen] and Felicity [Smoak]'s relationship, or run Palmer Technologies long term, since it was widely known that he would be a huge part of ''Legends''.\" Additionally, the annual ''Arrow''/''The Flash'' crossover suffered from also trying to set up ''Legends'', which was \"too much to ask from the already crowded storylines and ended up feeling like an exercise in synchronicity, with producers planting more seeds than they could reap. The crossover event was no longer a fun way to contrast the two shows; it now had to serve the much larger purpose of setting up an entirely new world.\" Walker stated that the premiere of ''Legends'' \"means that ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' can finally stop dedicating so much time and plot to laying the groundwork for the spin-off, and start focusing on the fundamentals of their own shows again.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-arrow-flash-plots/ |title=How Legends Of Tomorrow Has Hurt Arrow & The Flash |last=Walker |first=Alice |date=January 20, 2016 |website=ScreenRant |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408004114/http://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-arrow-flash-plots/ |archive-date=April 8, 2017 |access-date=January 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the \"Elseworlds\" crossover teased the comic ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' would be adapted in the 2019 crossover, Mike Cecchini of Den of Geek stated, \"The Arrowverse is becoming the most intricate, risky live action superhero universe in history.

Between 100 and 150 million years ago, during the Lower [[Cretaceous]] Period, the [[Bay of Biscay]] [[Seafloor spreading|fanned out]], pushing present-day Spain against France and applying intense [[Compression (geology)|compressional pressure]] to large layers of [[sedimentary rock]]. The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earth's crust first affected the eastern part and moved progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the [[Eocene]] Epoch.\n\nThe eastern part of the Pyrenees consists largely of [[granite]] and [[gneiss]]ose rocks, while in the western part the granite peaks are flanked by layers of [[limestone]]. The massive and unworn character of the chain comes from its abundance of [[granite]], which is particularly resistant to [[erosion]], as well as weak [[glacier|glacial]] development.\n\nThe upper parts of the Pyrenees contain low-relief surfaces forming a [[peneplain]]. This peneplain originated no earlier than in [[Miocene|Late Miocene]] times. Presumably it formed at height as extensive sedimentation raised the local [[base level]] considerably.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Babault |first1=Julien |last2=Van Den Driessche |first2=Jean|last3=Bonnet |first3=Stephanie|last4=Castelltort |first4=S\u00e9bastien|last5=Crave |first5=Alain |date=2005 |title=Origin of the highly elevated Pyrenean peneplain |url= https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:20401/ATTACHMENT01|journal=Tectonics |volume=24 |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1029/2004TC001697 |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n== Landscape ==\nConspicuous features of Pyrenean scenery are:\n* the absence of great lakes, such as those that fill the lateral valleys of the Alps<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the rarity and relative high elevation of usable [[Mountain pass|passes]]<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the large number of the mountain torrents locally called ''[[Gave (stem)|gaves]]'', which often form lofty [[waterfall]]s, surpassed in Europe only by those of [[Scandinavia]]<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the frequency with which the upper end of a valley assumes the form of a semicircle of precipitous cliffs, called a [[cirque]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe highest [[waterfall]] is [[Gavarnie Falls|Gavarnie]] (462&nbsp;m or 1,515&nbsp;ft), at the head of the [[Gave de Pau]]; the [[Cirque de Gavarnie]], in the same valley,<ref name=EB1911/> together with the nearby Cirque de Troumouse and [[Cirque d'Estaub\u00e9]], are notable examples of the [[cirque]] formation. \n\nLow passes are lacking, and the principal roads and the railroads between France and Spain run only in the lowlands at the western and eastern ends of the Pyrenees, near sea level at [[Irun]] and [[La Jonquera]]. The main passes of note are:\n* the [[Col de la Perche]] ({{convert|1581|m|abbr=on}}), towards the east, between the valley of the [[T\u00eat River|T\u00eat]] and the valley of the [[river Segre|Segre]], \n* the [[Pas de la Casa|Pas de la Casa or Port d'Envalira]], the highest road pass in the Pyrenees at {{convert|2408|m|abbr=on}}, and one of the highest points of the European road network, which provides the route from France to Andorra,\n* the nearby [[Col de Puymorens]] ({{convert|1920|m|abbr=on}}), on [[European route E09]] between the French departments of [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]] and [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] [[Northern Catalonia|(Northern Catalonia).]]\n* the [[Port de la Bonaigua]] ({{convert|2070|m|abbr=on}}) connects Val d'Aran to the rest of Catalonia, although the nearby col at Plan de Beret ({{convert|1870|m|abbr=on}}), the watershed between the [[Garonne]] and the [[Noguera Pallaresa]], is the lowest point in the main ridge between the Col de la Perche, almost {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the east and the [[Col du Pourtalet]] ({{convert|1794|m|abbr=on}}), over {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the west.\n* the Col de [[Somport]] or Port de Canfranc ({{convert|1632|m|abbr=on}}), where there were old [[Roman road]]s. \n* the [[Roncevaux Pass]] ({{convert|1057|m|abbr=on}}), entirely in [[Navarre]] (Spain) is an important point on the [[Santiago de Compostela]] pilgrimage route\n\nBecause of the lack of low passes a number of tunnels have been drilled beneath the passes at Somport, Envalira and Puymorens, and new routes in the center of the range at [[Bielsa]] and [[Vielha Tunnel|Vielha]], as well as in the foothills of the Catalan Pyrenees at [[Serra del Cad\u00ed]].\n\nA notable visual feature of this [[mountain range]] is [[La Br\u00e8che de Roland]], a gap in the ridge line, which{{spaced ndash}}according to legend{{spaced ndash}}was created by [[Roland]].\n\n[[File:Ib\u00f3n.JPG|thumb|Ib\u00f3n (glacial lake) Basa Mora, in Gistain valley, [[Aragon]]. ]]\n\n== Natural resources ==\nThe metallic [[ore]]s of the Pyrenees are not in general of much importance now, though there were [[iron]] mines at several locations in [[Geography of Andorra#Natural resources|Andorra]], as well as at [[Vicdessos]] in Ari\u00e8ge, and the foot of [[Canigou]] in [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] ([[Northern Catalonia]]) long ago. [[Coal]] deposits capable of being profitably worked are situated chiefly on the Spanish slopes, but the French side has beds of [[lignite]].<ref name=EB1911/> The open pit of Trimoun near the commune of [[Luzenac]] (Ari\u00e8ge) is one of the greatest sources of [[talc]] in Europe.\n\n[[Mineral spring]]s are abundant and remarkable, and especially noteworthy are the [[hot spring]]s. The hot springs, among which those of [[Les Escaldes]] in Andorra, [[Panticosa]] and [[Lles]] in Spain, [[Ax-les-Thermes]], [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon]] and [[Eaux-Chaudes]] in France may be mentioned, are [[sulfur]]ous and mostly situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The lower springs, such as those of [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre]] ([[Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]), [[Rennes-les-Bains]] ([[Aude]]), and [[Campagne-sur-Aude]] (Aude), are mostly selenitic and not hot.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n== Climate ==\nThe amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] the range receives, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in the eastern Pyrenees<ref name=EB1911/> because of the moist air that blows in from the Atlantic Ocean over the [[Bay of Biscay]]. After dropping its moisture over the western and central Pyrenees, the air is left dry over the eastern Pyrenees. The winter average temperature is {{cvt|-2|\u00b0C}}.\n\nSections of the mountain range vary in more than one respect. There are some [[glacier]]s in the western and snowy central Pyrenees, but there are no glaciers in the eastern Pyrenees because there is insufficient snowfall to cause their development. Glaciers are confined to the northern slopes of the central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the Alps, far down into the valleys but rather have their greatest lengths along the direction of the mountain chain. They form, in fact, in a narrow zone near the crest of the highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central Europe, there is substantial evidence of a much wider expanse of glaciation during the [[glacial period]]s. The best evidence of this is in the valley of Argeles Gazost, between Lourdes and Gavarnie, in the ''{{lang|fr|d\u00e9partement}}'' of Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe annual snow-line varies in different parts of the Pyrenees from about {{convert|2700|to|2800|m}} above sea level.<ref name=EB1911/> In average the seasonal snow is observed at least 50% of the time above {{convert|1600|m}} between December and April.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gascoin|first1=S.|last2=Hagolle|first2=O.|last3=Huc|first3=M.|last4=Jarlan|first4=L.|last5=Dejoux|first5=J.F.|last6=Szczypta|first6=C.|last7=Marti|first7=R.|last8=S\u00e1nchez|first8=R.|title=A snow cover climatology for the Pyrenees from MODIS snow products|journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences|date=2015|issue=19|pages=2337\u20132351|doi=10.5194/hess-19-2337-2015|url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|access-date=2015-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529112043/http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|archive-date=2015-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n[[File:Cascada aigualluts.jpg|thumb|Aigualluts cascade in Benasque Valley, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]]\n{{See also|Forests of the Iberian Peninsula#The Eurosiberian region|l1=Forests of the Iberian Peninsula - Eurosiberian region}}\n\n=== Flora ===\n{{Main category|Flora of the Pyrenees}}\nA still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half of the chain is seen in the vegetation. The lower mountains in the extreme west are wooded, but the extent of forest declines as one moves eastwards. The eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and barren, all the more since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. Also moving from west to east, there is a change in the composition of the flora, with the change becoming most evident as one passes the centre of the mountain chain from which point the [[Corbi\u00e8res (region)|Corbi\u00e8res]] stretch north-eastwards towards the central plateau of France. Though the difference in latitude is only about 1\u00b0, in the west the flora resembles that of central Europe while in the east it is distinctly Mediterranean in character. The Pyrenees are nearly as rich in [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species as the Alps, and among the most remarkable instances of that [[endemism]] is the occurrence of the monotypic genus ''Xatardia'' (family [[Apiaceae]]), which grows only on a high alpine pass between the Val d'Eynes and [[Catalonia]]. Other examples include ''[[Arenaria montana]]'', ''[[Bulbocodium vernum]]'', and ''[[Ranunculus glacialis]]''. The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the [[saxifrage]]s, several species of which are endemic here.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Fauna ===\nIn their [[fauna]] the Pyrenees present some striking instances of [[endemism]]. The [[Pyrenean desman]] is found only in some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains; the only other [[desman]]s are confined to the rivers of the [[Caucasus]] in southern Russia. The Pyrenean euprocte (''Euproctus pyrenaicus''), an endemic relative of the [[salamander]], also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among other peculiarities of Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the [[cave]]rns of Ari\u00e8ge, the principal genera of which are ''[[Anophthalmus]]'' and ''Adelops''.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pyrenees|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pyrenean ibex]] mysteriously became extinct in January 2000; the native Pyrenean [[brown bear]] was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s, but it was re-introduced in 1996 when three bears were brought from [[Slovenia]]. The bear population has bred successfully, and there are now believed to be about 15 brown bears in the central region around [[Fos, Haute-Garonne|Fos]], but only four native ones are still living in the [[Aspe Valley]].\n\n== Protected areas ==\n[[File:20080824-Ib\u00f3n de Barrancs.jpg|thumb|Ib\u00f3n de Barrancs ([[glacial lake]]) in Posets-Maladeta Natural Park, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]]\nPrincipal nature reserves and national parks:\n*[[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park]] (Spain)\n*[[Pyrenees National Park|Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es National Park]] (France)\n*[[Aig\u00fcestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park]] (Spain)\n*[[Natural Park of Posets-Maladeta|Posets-Maladeta Natural Park]] (Spain)\n\n== Demographics and culture ==\n[[File:Bovins estive Pic du Midi Ossau.jpg|thumb|Some [[Blonde d'Aquitaine]] on summer pasture near the [[Pic du Midi d'Ossau]]]]\nThe Pyrenean region possesses a varied ethnology, [[folklore]] and history: see [[Andorra]]; [[Aragon]]; [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]]; [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]; [[B\u00e9arn]]; [[Catalonia]]; [[Navarre]]; [[Roussillon]].

The Pyrenees are also a good place for athletes to do high-altitude training in the summertime, such as by bicycling and cross-country running.\n\nIn the [[summer]] and the [[autumn]], the Pyrenees are usually featured in two of cycling's grand tours, the [[Tour de France]] held annually in July and the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] held in September. The stages held in the Pyrenees are often crucial legs of both tours, drawing hundreds of thousands of spectators to the region.\n\nThree main [[long-distance footpath]]s run the length of the mountain range: the [[GR 10 (France)|GR 10]] across the northern slopes, the [[GR 11 (Spain)|GR 11]] across the southern slopes, and the [[Haute Randonn\u00e9e Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9enne|HRP]] which traverses peaks and ridges along a high altitude route.

As is often the case in stories of this hero, the sober Hercules responds with heartbroken grief and remorse at the actions of his darker self, and lays Pyrene to rest tenderly, demanding that the surrounding geography join in mourning and preserve her name:<ref>Ben Tipping, ''Exemplary Epic: Silius Italicus' Punica'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 20\u201321 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d7asVuCBugAC&pg=PA20&dq=pyrene+geryon&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=5#v=onepage&q=pyrene%20geryon&f=false online.]</ref> \"struck by Herculean voice, the mountaintops shudder at the ridges; he kept crying out with a sorrowful noise 'Pyrene!' and all the rock-cliffs and wild-beast haunts echo back 'Pyrene!' \u2026 The mountains hold on to the wept-over name through the ages.\" [[Pliny the Elder]] connects the story of Hercules and Pyrene to [[Lusitania]], but rejects it as ''fabulosa'', highly fictional.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=3:chapter=3&highlight=pyrene 3.3.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014054043/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=3:chapter=3&highlight=pyrene |date=2012-10-14 }}</ref>\n\nOther classical sources derived the name from the Greek word for fire, {{lang-grc|\u03c0\u1fe6\u03c1}} (IPA: {{IPA|/p\u0177\u02d0r/}}).<ref>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) \nWilliam Smith, LLD, Ed.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=pyrenaei-montes-geo]\n</ref> According to Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] \"in ancient times, we are told, certain herdsmen left a fire and the whole area of the mountains was entirely consumed; and due to this fire, since it raged continuously day after day, the surface of the earth was also burned and the mountains, because of what had taken place, were called the Pyrenees.\"<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''The Library of History'' Vol III, 35[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5B*.html]</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Political divisions ===\nThe '''Spanish Pyrenees''' are part of the following [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]], from east to west: [[Girona Province|Girona]], [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona]], [[Lleida Province|Lleida]] (all in [[Catalonia]]), [[Huesca Province|Huesca]] (in [[Aragon]]), [[Navarra]] (in [[Navarre]]) and [[Gipuzkoa]] (in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]).\n\nThe '''French Pyrenees''' are part of the following ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]s'', from east to west: [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] ([[North Catalonia]] and [[Fenolheda]]), [[Aude]], [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]], [[Haute-Garonne]], [[Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]], and [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]] (the latter two of which include the [[Pyrenees National Park]]).\n\nThe independent principality of [[Andorra]] is in the Catalan Pyrenees, sandwiched between Spain and France.\n\n[[File:Pyrenees composite NASA.jpg|frame|center|Composite satellite image of the Pyrenees ([[NASA]])]]\n[[File:Aneto 01.jpg|thumb|[[Pico de Aneto]], the highest mountain of the Pyrenees]]\n[[File:Pic de Bugatet.jpg|thumb|[[Pic de Bugatet]] in the [[N\u00e9ouvielle massif]]]]\n[[File:Pedraforca.jpg|thumb|[[Pedraforca]], Catalonia (Spain)]]\n[[File:Baretous piemont Pyreneen.jpg|thumb|Baretous Valley and Piedmont plain, in the French western Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]\n[[File:Gavarnie-Cirque.JPG|thumb|[[Cirque de Gavarnie]], [[Occitanie]] (France)]]\n[[File:San Mauricio lake.jpg|thumb|Sant Maurici lake in the [[Aig\u00fcestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park]], Catalonia (Spain)]]\n\n=== Physiographical divisions ===\n[[File:Monteperdido y Cilindro.jpg|thumb|Monte Perdido, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]] \n[[Physical geography|Physiographically]], the Pyrenees may be divided into three sections: the Atlantic (or Western), the Central, and the Eastern Pyrenees.

Between 100 and 150 million years ago, during the Lower [[Cretaceous]] Period, the [[Bay of Biscay]] [[Seafloor spreading|fanned out]], pushing present-day Spain against France and applying intense [[Compression (geology)|compressional pressure]] to large layers of [[sedimentary rock]]. The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earth's crust first affected the eastern part and moved progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the [[Eocene]] Epoch.\n\nThe eastern part of the Pyrenees consists largely of [[granite]] and [[gneiss]]ose rocks, while in the western part the granite peaks are flanked by layers of [[limestone]]. The massive and unworn character of the chain comes from its abundance of [[granite]], which is particularly resistant to [[erosion]], as well as weak [[glacier|glacial]] development.\n\nThe upper parts of the Pyrenees contain low-relief surfaces forming a [[peneplain]]. This peneplain originated no earlier than in [[Miocene|Late Miocene]] times. Presumably it formed at height as extensive sedimentation raised the local [[base level]] considerably.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Babault |first1=Julien |last2=Van Den Driessche |first2=Jean|last3=Bonnet |first3=Stephanie|last4=Castelltort |first4=S\u00e9bastien|last5=Crave |first5=Alain |date=2005 |title=Origin of the highly elevated Pyrenean peneplain |url= https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:20401/ATTACHMENT01|journal=Tectonics |volume=24 |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1029/2004TC001697 |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n== Landscape ==\nConspicuous features of Pyrenean scenery are:\n* the absence of great lakes, such as those that fill the lateral valleys of the Alps<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the rarity and relative high elevation of usable [[Mountain pass|passes]]<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the large number of the mountain torrents locally called ''[[Gave (stem)|gaves]]'', which often form lofty [[waterfall]]s, surpassed in Europe only by those of [[Scandinavia]]<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the frequency with which the upper end of a valley assumes the form of a semicircle of precipitous cliffs, called a [[cirque]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe highest [[waterfall]] is [[Gavarnie Falls|Gavarnie]] (462&nbsp;m or 1,515&nbsp;ft), at the head of the [[Gave de Pau]]; the [[Cirque de Gavarnie]], in the same valley,<ref name=EB1911/> together with the nearby Cirque de Troumouse and [[Cirque d'Estaub\u00e9]], are notable examples of the [[cirque]] formation. \n\nLow passes are lacking, and the principal roads and the railroads between France and Spain run only in the lowlands at the western and eastern ends of the Pyrenees, near sea level at [[Irun]] and [[La Jonquera]]. The main passes of note are:\n* the [[Col de la Perche]] ({{convert|1581|m|abbr=on}}), towards the east, between the valley of the [[T\u00eat River|T\u00eat]] and the valley of the [[river Segre|Segre]], \n* the [[Pas de la Casa|Pas de la Casa or Port d'Envalira]], the highest road pass in the Pyrenees at {{convert|2408|m|abbr=on}}, and one of the highest points of the European road network, which provides the route from France to Andorra,\n* the nearby [[Col de Puymorens]] ({{convert|1920|m|abbr=on}}), on [[European route E09]] between the French departments of [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]] and [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] [[Northern Catalonia|(Northern Catalonia).]]\n* the [[Port de la Bonaigua]] ({{convert|2070|m|abbr=on}}) connects Val d'Aran to the rest of Catalonia, although the nearby col at Plan de Beret ({{convert|1870|m|abbr=on}}), the watershed between the [[Garonne]] and the [[Noguera Pallaresa]], is the lowest point in the main ridge between the Col de la Perche, almost {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the east and the [[Col du Pourtalet]] ({{convert|1794|m|abbr=on}}), over {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the west.\n* the Col de [[Somport]] or Port de Canfranc ({{convert|1632|m|abbr=on}}), where there were old [[Roman road]]s. \n* the [[Roncevaux Pass]] ({{convert|1057|m|abbr=on}}), entirely in [[Navarre]] (Spain) is an important point on the [[Santiago de Compostela]] pilgrimage route\n\nBecause of the lack of low passes a number of tunnels have been drilled beneath the passes at Somport, Envalira and Puymorens, and new routes in the center of the range at [[Bielsa]] and [[Vielha Tunnel|Vielha]], as well as in the foothills of the Catalan Pyrenees at [[Serra del Cad\u00ed]].\n\nA notable visual feature of this [[mountain range]] is [[La Br\u00e8che de Roland]], a gap in the ridge line, which{{spaced ndash}}according to legend{{spaced ndash}}was created by [[Roland]].\n\n[[File:Ib\u00f3n.JPG|thumb|Ib\u00f3n (glacial lake) Basa Mora, in Gistain valley, [[Aragon]]. ]]\n\n== Natural resources ==\nThe metallic [[ore]]s of the Pyrenees are not in general of much importance now, though there were [[iron]] mines at several locations in [[Geography of Andorra#Natural resources|Andorra]], as well as at [[Vicdessos]] in Ari\u00e8ge, and the foot of [[Canigou]] in [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] ([[Northern Catalonia]]) long ago. [[Coal]] deposits capable of being profitably worked are situated chiefly on the Spanish slopes, but the French side has beds of [[lignite]].<ref name=EB1911/> The open pit of Trimoun near the commune of [[Luzenac]] (Ari\u00e8ge) is one of the greatest sources of [[talc]] in Europe.\n\n[[Mineral spring]]s are abundant and remarkable, and especially noteworthy are the [[hot spring]]s. The hot springs, among which those of [[Les Escaldes]] in Andorra, [[Panticosa]] and [[Lles]] in Spain, [[Ax-les-Thermes]], [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon]] and [[Eaux-Chaudes]] in France may be mentioned, are [[sulfur]]ous and mostly situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The lower springs, such as those of [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre]] ([[Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]), [[Rennes-les-Bains]] ([[Aude]]), and [[Campagne-sur-Aude]] (Aude), are mostly selenitic and not hot.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n== Climate ==\nThe amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] the range receives, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in the eastern Pyrenees<ref name=EB1911/> because of the moist air that blows in from the Atlantic Ocean over the [[Bay of Biscay]]. After dropping its moisture over the western and central Pyrenees, the air is left dry over the eastern Pyrenees. The winter average temperature is {{cvt|-2|\u00b0C}}.\n\nSections of the mountain range vary in more than one respect. There are some [[glacier]]s in the western and snowy central Pyrenees, but there are no glaciers in the eastern Pyrenees because there is insufficient snowfall to cause their development. Glaciers are confined to the northern slopes of the central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the Alps, far down into the valleys but rather have their greatest lengths along the direction of the mountain chain. They form, in fact, in a narrow zone near the crest of the highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central Europe, there is substantial evidence of a much wider expanse of glaciation during the [[glacial period]]s. The best evidence of this is in the valley of Argeles Gazost, between Lourdes and Gavarnie, in the ''{{lang|fr|d\u00e9partement}}'' of Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe annual snow-line varies in different parts of the Pyrenees from about {{convert|2700|to|2800|m}} above sea level.<ref name=EB1911/> In average the seasonal snow is observed at least 50% of the time above {{convert|1600|m}} between December and April.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gascoin|first1=S.|last2=Hagolle|first2=O.|last3=Huc|first3=M.|last4=Jarlan|first4=L.|last5=Dejoux|first5=J.F.|last6=Szczypta|first6=C.|last7=Marti|first7=R.|last8=S\u00e1nchez|first8=R.|title=A snow cover climatology for the Pyrenees from MODIS snow products|journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences|date=2015|issue=19|pages=2337\u20132351|doi=10.5194/hess-19-2337-2015|url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|access-date=2015-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529112043/http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|archive-date=2015-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n[[File:Cascada aigualluts.jpg|thumb|Aigualluts cascade in Benasque Valley, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]]\n{{See also|Forests of the Iberian Peninsula#The Eurosiberian region|l1=Forests of the Iberian Peninsula - Eurosiberian region}}\n\n=== Flora ===\n{{Main category|Flora of the Pyrenees}}\nA still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half of the chain is seen in the vegetation. The lower mountains in the extreme west are wooded, but the extent of forest declines as one moves eastwards. The eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and barren, all the more since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. Also moving from west to east, there is a change in the composition of the flora, with the change becoming most evident as one passes the centre of the mountain chain from which point the [[Corbi\u00e8res (region)|Corbi\u00e8res]] stretch north-eastwards towards the central plateau of France. Though the difference in latitude is only about 1\u00b0, in the west the flora resembles that of central Europe while in the east it is distinctly Mediterranean in character. The Pyrenees are nearly as rich in [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species as the Alps, and among the most remarkable instances of that [[endemism]] is the occurrence of the monotypic genus ''Xatardia'' (family [[Apiaceae]]), which grows only on a high alpine pass between the Val d'Eynes and [[Catalonia]]. Other examples include ''[[Arenaria montana]]'', ''[[Bulbocodium vernum]]'', and ''[[Ranunculus glacialis]]''. The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the [[saxifrage]]s, several species of which are endemic here.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Fauna ===\nIn their [[fauna]] the Pyrenees present some striking instances of [[endemism]]. The [[Pyrenean desman]] is found only in some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains; the only other [[desman]]s are confined to the rivers of the [[Caucasus]] in southern Russia. The Pyrenean euprocte (''Euproctus pyrenaicus''), an endemic relative of the [[salamander]], also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among other peculiarities of Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the [[cave]]rns of Ari\u00e8ge, the principal genera of which are ''[[Anophthalmus]]'' and ''Adelops''.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pyrenees|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pyrenean ibex]] mysteriously became extinct in January 2000; the native Pyrenean [[brown bear]] was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s, but it was re-introduced in 1996 when three bears were brought from [[Slovenia]]. The bear population has bred successfully, and there are now believed to be about 15 brown bears in the central region around [[Fos, Haute-Garonne|Fos]], but only four native ones are still living in the [[Aspe Valley]].\n\n== Protected areas ==\n[[File:20080824-Ib\u00f3n de Barrancs.jpg|thumb|Ib\u00f3n de Barrancs ([[glacial lake]]) in Posets-Maladeta Natural Park, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]]\nPrincipal nature reserves and national parks:\n*[[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park]] (Spain)\n*[[Pyrenees National Park|Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es National Park]] (France)\n*[[Aig\u00fcestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park]] (Spain)\n*[[Natural Park of Posets-Maladeta|Posets-Maladeta Natural Park]] (Spain)\n\n== Demographics and culture ==\n[[File:Bovins estive Pic du Midi Ossau.jpg|thumb|Some [[Blonde d'Aquitaine]] on summer pasture near the [[Pic du Midi d'Ossau]]]]\nThe Pyrenean region possesses a varied ethnology, [[folklore]] and history: see [[Andorra]]; [[Aragon]]; [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]]; [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]; [[B\u00e9arn]]; [[Catalonia]]; [[Navarre]]; [[Roussillon]].

The Pyrenees are also a good place for athletes to do high-altitude training in the summertime, such as by bicycling and cross-country running.\n\nIn the [[summer]] and the [[autumn]], the Pyrenees are usually featured in two of cycling's grand tours, the [[Tour de France]] held annually in July and the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] held in September. The stages held in the Pyrenees are often crucial legs of both tours, drawing hundreds of thousands of spectators to the region.\n\nThree main [[long-distance footpath]]s run the length of the mountain range: the [[GR 10 (France)|GR 10]] across the northern slopes, the [[GR 11 (Spain)|GR 11]] across the southern slopes, and the [[Haute Randonn\u00e9e Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9enne|HRP]] which traverses peaks and ridges along a high altitude route.

Beginning in 1933, gay organizations were banned, scholarly books about homosexuality, and [[human sexuality|sexuality]] in general (such as those from the [[Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft]], run by Jewish gay rights campaigner [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]), were [[book burning|burned]], and homosexuals within the Nazi Party itself were murdered. Germany's vibrant gay community at the time became heavily repressed as the [[Gestapo]] compiled lists of homosexuals, who were compelled to sexually conform to the \"German norm\". Gay clubs were shut down as homosexual men were no longer permitted to openly socialize with one another. While some gay men who were not sent to camps emigrated to safety, others withdrew from homosexual practices or engaged in heterosexual relationships to cover their identities.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1945, an estimated 100,000 men were arrested as homosexuals, of whom some 50,000 were officially sentenced. Police compiled list of suspected homosexuals after torturing and compelling gay men to identify others as homosexuals. Most of these men served time in regular prisons, and an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 of those sentenced were incarcerated in [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref name=USHM>{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005261 |title=Persecution of Homosexuals in the Third Reich |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |accessdate= February 26, 2018}}</ref> It is unclear how many of the 5,000 to 15,000 would die in the camps, but leading scholar [[R\u00fcdiger Lautmann]] believes that the death rate of homosexuals in concentration camps may have been as high as 60%. Homosexuals in the camps suffered an unusual degree of cruelty by their captors, including being used as target practice on shooting ranges. Homosexuals were additionally used as the subjects for Nazi medical experiments as scientists tried to find a \"cure\" for homosexuality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-exhibitions/special-focus/nazi-persecution-of-homosexuals|title=Online Exhibition \u2014 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|website=www.ushmm.org|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref> These estimates include only individuals singled out for their sexual orientation. Many others had already been sent to the camps simply based on their ethnic or religious background without need of other justification. Little study has been done to estimate the number of Jewish homosexuals who died in the camps.\n\nAfter the war, the treatment of homosexuals in concentration camps went unacknowledged by most countries, and some men were even re-arrested and imprisoned based on evidence found during [[Nazi Germany|the Nazi years]].

During the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in 1934, a purge of those whom Hitler deemed threats to his power, he had R\u00f6hm murdered and used R\u00f6hm's homosexuality as a justification to suppress outrage within the ranks of the SA. After solidifying his power, Hitler would include gay men among those sent to concentration camps during the Holocaust.\n\n[[Heinrich Himmler]] had initially been a supporter of R\u00f6hm, arguing that the charges of homosexuality against him were manufactured by Jews.

Paragraph 175 read: \"An unnatural sex act committed between persons of male sex or by humans with animals is punishable by imprisonment; the loss of civil rights might also be imposed.\" The law was interpreted differently across the nation until the ruling of a court case on April 23, 1880. The ''[[Reichsgericht]]'' (Imperial Court of Justice) ruled that a criminal homosexual act had to involve either anal, oral, or [[intercrural sex]] between two men. Anything less than that was deemed harmless play.<ref>{{cite book|last=Giles|first=Geoffrey J|title=Social Outsiders in Nazi Germany|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=240}}</ref> The German police forces (until 1936 all policing was the responsibility of the ''L\u00e4nder'' governments) found this new interpretation of paragraph 175 extremely difficult to prove in court since it was hard to find witnesses to these acts. The enforcement of Paragraph 175 varied at times, with for instance a major and unprecedented crackdown on homosexuals being launched after the Eulenburg-Harden affair of 1906-09 led to a homophobic moral panic in Germany.<ref>Domeier, Norman ''The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire'', Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 pages 103\u2013104</ref> Enforcement also varied from ''land'' to ''land'' with Prussia under the leadership of the Social Democrat Otto Braun refusing to enforce Paragraph 175 from 1918 to 1932. As convictions often had to prove homosexual conduct that occurred in private, the interpretation of Paragraph 175 only resulted in approximately 500 convictions per annum. However, homosexuals often faced other forms of marginalization from chanteure, or blackmailers, through informal prosecution.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The racial state : Germany, 1933-1945|last=Burleigh, Michael, 1955-|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Wippermann, Wolfgang, 1945-, Mazal Holocaust Collection.|isbn=0521391148|location=Cambridge [England]|oclc=22597244|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Night of the Long Knives, the ''Reich'' Justice Minister [[Franz G\u00fcrtner]] (who was not a Nazi at the time) amended paragraph 175 due to what his government saw as loopholes in the law. The 1935 version of Paragraph 175 also declared any \"expression\" of homosexuality was now a criminal act. The most significant change to the law was the change from \"An unnatural sex act committed between persons of male sex\" to \"A male who commits a sex offense with another male.\" This expanded the reach of the law to persecute gay men. Kissing, mutual masturbation and love-letters between men served as a legitimate reason for the police to make an arrest. The law never states what a sex offence actually is, leaving it open to subjective interpretation. Men who practiced what was known to be harmless amusement with other men were now subject to arrest under the law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Giles|first=Geoffrey J.|title=Social Outsiders in Nazi Germany|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=240\u2013242}}</ref> Additionally, in 1935 paragraph 175 was altered with paragraph 175a which expanded the criminal offenses relating to homosexuality.

Giles the [[SS]], and its leader [[Heinrich Himmler]], were particularly concerned about homosexuality.  More than any other Nazi leader, Himmler's writing and speeches denounced homosexuality. However, despite consistently condemning homosexuals and homosexual activity, Himmler was less consistent in his punishment of homosexuals.  In Geoffrey Giles' article \"The Denial of Homosexuality: Same-Sex Incidents in Himmler's SS\", several cases are put forward where members of the Nazi SS were tried for homosexual offences.  On a case by case basis, the outcomes vary widely, and Giles gives documented evidence where the judges could be swayed by evidence demonstrating the accused's \"[[aryan]]-ness\" or \"manliness\", that is, by describing him as coming from true Germanic stock and perhaps fathering children. Reasons for Himmler's leniency in some cases may derive from the difficulty in defining homosexuality, particularly in a society that glorifies the masculine ideal and brotherhood.<ref>Giles, Geoffrey J., \"The Denial of Homosexuality: Same-Sex Incidents in Himmler's SS\", Journal of the History of Sexuality, Vol. 11, No. 1/2, Special Issue: Sexuality and German Fascism (Jan. \u2013 Apr. 2002), pp. 256\u2013290</ref>\n\nNot only was Himmler's persecution of homosexuals based on this masculine ideal, but it was also driven by societal issues. On February 18, 1937 Himmler gave his most detailed speech on the topic in [[Bad T\u00f6lz]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Longerich|first=Peter|title=Heinrich Himmler|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=232}}</ref> Himmler starts his speech off covering the social aspect of the problem. He reminds his listeners of the number of registered members in homosexual associations. He was not convinced that every homosexual was registered in these clubs, but he was also not convinced everyone registered was a homosexual. Himmler estimated the number of homosexuals from one to two million people, or 7 to 10% of men in Germany. He explained \"If this remains the case, it means that our nation will be destroyed by this plague.\" Adding the number of homosexuals to the number of men that died in the previous war, Himmler estimated that this would equal four million men. If these four million men are no longer capable of having sex with a female, then this \"upsets the balance of the sexes in Germany and is leading to catastrophe\". Germany was having population issues with the number of killed men during the First World War. Himmler believed \"A people of good race which has too few children has a sure ticket for the grave, for insignificance in fifty to one hundred years, for burial in two hundred and fifty years.\"<ref name=speech>{{cite web|last=Himmler|first=Heinrich|title=Heinrich Himmler \u2013 Speech about Homosexuality to the SS Group Leaders|url=http://der-stuermer.org/english/Heinrich%20Himmler%20speech%20-%2018.02.1937.pdf|accessdate=2014-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Concentration camps==\n[[File:Sachsenhausen-hsexual-wyrd.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]]]\nHomosexuals were considered to be the lowest of the low in the concentration camp hierarchy.<ref name=H>{{cite journal| pmid=8905527 | doi=10.1300/J082v31n04_01 | volume=31 | issue=4 | title=Homosexual inmates in the Buchenwald Concentration Camp | year=1996 | journal=J Homosex | pages=1\u201328 | last1 = R\u00f6ll | first1 = W}}</ref> Estimates vary widely as to the number of gay men imprisoned in concentration camps during the Holocaust, ranging from 5,000 to 15,000, many of whom died.<ref name=USHM/> In addition, records as to the specific reasons for internment are non-existent in many areas, making it hard to put an exact number on exactly how many gay men perished in death camps.

Additionally, homosexuals in concentration camps lacked the ability to practice group solidarity, which aided other groups like political prisoners, for their morale. Peukert wrote the campaign to crush homosexuality together with the campaign against the \"asocials\" was approved of by \"wide sections of the population, including many who criticized the detention and torture of political opponents of the regime\".<ref>Peukert, Detlev ''Inside Nazi Germany'', New Haven, Yale, 1987 p.199.</ref> The marginalization of gay men in Germany was reflected in the camps. Many died from beatings, some of them inflicted by other prisoners. Experiences such as these can account for the high death rate of gay men in the camps as compared to the other \"asocial\" groups.

In his account he states that he participated in his local gay community in the town of [[Mulhouse]] in the Alsace region of France. When Alsace was effectively annexed to Germany in 1940,  his name was on a list of local gay men ordered to the police station. He obeyed the directive to protect his family from any retaliation. Upon arriving at the police station he notes that he and other gay men were beaten. Some gay men who resisted the SS had their fingernails pulled out. Others had their bowels punctured, causing them to bleed profusely. After his arrest he was sent to the concentration camp at Schirmeck. There, Seel stated that during a morning roll-call, the Nazi commander announced a public execution. A man was brought out, and Seel recognized his face. It was the face of his eighteen-year-old lover from Mulhouse. Seel states that the SS guards then stripped the clothes off his lover, placed a metal bucket over his head, and released trained [[German Shepherd Dog|German Shepherd dogs]] on him, which mauled him to death.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n[[Rudolf Brazda]], believed to be the last surviving person who was sent to a Nazi concentration camp because of his homosexuality, died in France in August 2011, aged 98.

However, extensive research on the topic was impeded by a continuation of Nazi policies on homosexuals in post-war East and West Germany and continued western notions of homophobia.<ref>Heinz Heger, The Men With the Pink Triangle (Hamburg: Melin-Verlag, 1980) pp. 14</ref>\n\nThe word ''[[genocide]]'' was generated from a need for new terminology in order to understand the gravity of the crimes committed by the Nazis.<ref>David Scheffer, ''Genocide and Atrocity Crimes'', Genocide Studies and Prevention 1, no. 3 (2006) pp. 230</ref> First coined by [[Raphael Lemkin]] in 1944, the word became politically charged when The Genocide Act was enacted by the United Nations on December 9, 1948, which created an obligation for governments to respond to such atrocities in the future. The debate on the ''Gay Holocaust'' is therefore a highly loaded debate which would result in an international acknowledgement of state sponsored homophobia as a precursor to genocide should the proponents of the ''Gay Holocaust'' succeed. However the [[United Nations]] definition does not include sexual orientation (or even social and political groups) within its qualifications for the crime. Genocide by the U.N. definition is limited to national, ethnical, racial or religious groups and as this is the only accord to which nations have pledged allegiance, it stands as the dominant understanding of the term.<ref>David Scheffer, ''Genocide and Atrocity Crimes'', Genocide Studies and Prevention 1, no. 3 (2006)</ref> It is, however, what Michel-Rolph Trouillot terms \"an age when collective apologies are becoming increasingly common\"<ref>Michel-Rolph Trouillot, ''Abortive Rituals: Historical Apologies in the Global Era'', Interventions 2, (2000) pp. 172</ref> as well as a time when the established Holocaust discourse has settled and legitimized claims of the Jewish, Roma and mentally ill victims of Nazi persecution so it would seem an appropriate time to at least bring attention to the debate of the Gay Holocaust, even if the issue is not to be settled.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nA lack of research means that there is relatively little data on the dispersion of gay men throughout the camps. However, [[Heinz Heger]] suggests in his book ''The Men with the Pink Triangle'' that they were subjected to harsher labor than smaller targeted groups, such as the political prisoners, and furthermore suffered a much higher mortality rate.<ref name=\"Heinz Heger 1980 pp. 13\">Heinz Heger, ''The Men With the Pink Triangle'' (Hamburg: Melin-Verlag, 1980) pp. 13</ref> They also lacked a support network within the camps and were ostracized in the prison community.<ref name=\"Heinz Heger 1980 pp. 13\"/> Homosexuals, like the mentally ill and many Jews and Roma, were also subjected to medical experimentation in the hopes of finding a cure to homosexuality at the camp in Buchenwald.<ref>Heinz Heger, ''The Men With the Pink Triangle'' (Hamburg: Melin-Verlag, 1980) pp. 12</ref>\n\nThe Jews were the only group targeted by the Nazi regime for complete annihilation regardless of their identification or place of residence.

The shift from the traditional notion of history as the story of power and those who held it, [[Social history|social historians]] emerged with narratives of those who suffered and resisted these powers. [[African American]]s created their own narrative, as firmly based on evidence as the discourses already in existence, as part of a social movement towards civil rights based on a history of [[Racism in the United States|victimization and racism]]. Along similar lines, the [[LGBT social movements|gay and lesbian movement]] in the United States also utilized revisionism to write the narrative that had only just garnered an audience willing to validate it.<ref name=Stein>Arlene Stein, \"Whose Memories? Whose Victimhood? Contests for the Holocaust Frame in Recent Social Movement Discourse\", ''Sociological Perspectives''; 41, no. 3 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998)</ref>\n\nThere were two processes at work in this new discourse, revisionism and appropriation, which Arlene Stein teases out in her article ''Whose Memory, Whose Victimhood?'', both of which were used at different points in the movement for civil rights. The revisionist project was taken on in a variety of mediums, historical literature being only one of many. The play ''[[Bent (play)|Bent]]'' and a limited number of memoirs which recall ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' coincided with the appropriation of the [[pink triangle]] as a symbol of the new movement and a reminder to \"never forget\".<ref name=Stein/> While the focus of these early revisions was not necessarily to determine the Nazi policy on homosexuals as genocidal, they began a current towards legitimizing the victimization of homosexuals under the regime, a topic that had not been addressed until the 1970s.\n\nHistorical works would turn focus on the nature and intent of Nazi policy. [[Heinz Heger]], Gunter Grau and [[Richard Plant (writer)|Richard Plant]] all contributed greatly to the early Holocaust discourse which emerged throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.<ref name=Stein/> Central to these studies was the notion that statistically speaking, homosexuals suffered greater losses than many of the smaller minorities under Nazi persecution such as the [[Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses]] and within the camps experienced harsher treatments and ostracization as well as execution.<ref>Heinz Heger (1980).

The conservative response yielded a new discourse working against the ''Gay Holocaust'' academia, which emphasized the gay and lesbian revisionism as a victimist discourse which sought sympathy and recognition as a pragmatic means of garnering special status and civil rights outside those of the moral majority.<ref name=\"Arlene Stein 1998 pp. 527\"/> Arlene Stein identifies four central elements to the conservative reaction to the Gay Holocaust discourse: she argues that the right is attempting to dispel the notion that gays are victims, pit two traditionally liberal constituencies against one another (gays and Jews), thereby drawing parallels between Jews and Christians and legitimating its own status as an oppressed and morally upright group.\n\nThe victimist argument raises a central tenet as to the reasons for which the discourse of a ''Gay Holocaust'' has experienced so much resistance politically and popularly (in the conscious of the public). Alyson M. Cole addresses the anti-victim discourse that has emerged in western politics since the end of the 1980s. She asserts \"anti-victimists transformed discussions of social obligation, compensations and remedial or restorative procedures into criticisms of the alleged propensity of self-anointed victims to engage in objectionable conduct.\" Though she is clear that the anti-victimist discourse is not limited to right-wing politics, the case of the ''Gay Holocaust'' situates itself along these political boundaries and the anti-victim discourse is highly relevant to the debate on homosexual claims to genocide under [[Nazi Germany|the Third Reich]]. Cole refutes what she sees as problems in the anti-victim arguments.<ref name=\"Alyson Cole 2007\">Alyson Cole, \"Situating Anti-Victim Discourse,\" ''The Cult of True Victimhood: From The War on Welfare to the War on Terror'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2007)</ref>\n\n==Post-revisionist framing of the \"Gay Holocaust\"==\n{{one source|section|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Arnold Bastian.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial \"[[Stolpersteine|Stolperstein]]\" for Arnold Bastian, a homosexual victim of the Nazis.

[[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (the Nazi Party) in Germany, [[gay]] men and, to a lesser extent, [[lesbian]]s were two of the numerous groups targeted by the Nazis and were ultimately among [[Holocaust victims]]. Beginning in 1933, gay organizations were banned, scholarly books about homosexuality, and [[human sexuality|sexuality]] in general (such as those from the [[Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft]], run by Jewish gay rights campaigner [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]), were [[book burning|burned]], and homosexuals within the Nazi Party itself were murdered. Germany's vibrant gay community at the time became heavily repressed as the [[Gestapo]] compiled lists of homosexuals, who were compelled to sexually conform to the \"German norm\". Gay clubs were shut down as homosexual men were no longer permitted to openly socialize with one another. While some gay men who were not sent to camps emigrated to safety, others withdrew from homosexual practices or engaged in heterosexual relationships to cover their identities.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1945, an estimated 100,000 men were arrested as homosexuals, of whom some 50,000 were officially sentenced. Police compiled list of suspected homosexuals after torturing and compelling gay men to identify others as homosexuals. Most of these men served time in regular prisons, and an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 of those sentenced were incarcerated in [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref name=USHM>{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005261 |title=Persecution of Homosexuals in the Third Reich |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |accessdate= February 26, 2018}}</ref> It is unclear how many of the 5,000 to 15,000 would die in the camps, but leading scholar [[R\u00fcdiger Lautmann]] believes that the death rate of homosexuals in concentration camps may have been as high as 60%. Homosexuals in the camps suffered an unusual degree of cruelty by their captors, including being used as target practice on shooting ranges. Homosexuals were additionally used as the subjects for Nazi medical experiments as scientists tried to find a \"cure\" for homosexuality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-exhibitions/special-focus/nazi-persecution-of-homosexuals|title=Online Exhibition \u2014 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|website=www.ushmm.org|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref> These estimates include only individuals singled out for their sexual orientation. Many others had already been sent to the camps simply based on their ethnic or religious background without need of other justification. Little study has been done to estimate the number of Jewish homosexuals who died in the camps.\n\nAfter the war, the treatment of homosexuals in concentration camps went unacknowledged by most countries, and some men were even re-arrested and imprisoned based on evidence found during [[Nazi Germany|the Nazi years]]. It was not until the 1980s that governments began to acknowledge this episode, and not until 2002 that the [[Politics of Germany|German government]] apologized to the [[gay community]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/world/germany/genews011.htm |title=Germany Offers Nazi-Era Pardons |author=Melissa Eddy |date=May 18, 2002 |publisher=Associated Press}}<!-- not official URL but it has the full text --></ref> In 2005, the [[European Parliament]] adopted a resolution on [[the Holocaust]] which included the [[Violence against LGBT people|persecution of homosexuals]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.de/european-parliamentarians-stand-up-against-homophobia/a-1874852|title=European Parliamentarians Stand Up Against Homophobia |author= Mathis Winkler |date=January 18, 2006 |publisher=Deutsche Welle}}</ref> Commissioned memorials around the world, including the [[Memorial to Homosexuals Persecuted Under Nazism]] in Berlin, commemorate the homosexual victims in Nazi Germany.

The German historian [[Detlev Peukert]] wrote that Nazi thinking about the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' was \"Its basis was the racialist elimination of all elements that deviated from the norm: refractory youth, idlers, the asocial, prostitutes, homosexuals, people who were incompetent or failures at work, the disabled.

As a consequence, many fled Germany (e.g., [[Erika Mann]], [[Richard Plant (writer)|Richard Plant]]). R\u00f6hm himself was gay, but he subscribed to an ultra-macho \"hard\" image and despised the \"soft\" homosexuals. Parties opposing Hitler even used Ernst, who was known to visit many of Berlin's gay clubs and parlors and was a member of the [[German League for Human Rights|League of Human Rights]], to attack Hitler by discussing \"Hitler's queer friend R\u00f6hm\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Arbeiterparteien und Homosexuellenfrage : zur Sexualpolitik von SPD und KPD in der Weimarer Republik|last=Eissler, W.

Within just weeks of Hitler's appointment as chancellor on January 30, 1933 the subsequent raids and crackdown throughout the year marked a stark turning point in the Nazi persecution of homosexuals.

A few days later on May 10, the Institute's library and archives were publicly hauled out and burned in the streets of the [[Opernplatz (Berlin)|Opernplatz]].

However, Hitler later changed course when he perceived R\u00f6hm to be a potential threat to his power. During the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in 1934, a purge of those whom Hitler deemed threats to his power, he had R\u00f6hm murdered and used R\u00f6hm's homosexuality as a justification to suppress outrage within the ranks of the SA. After solidifying his power, Hitler would include gay men among those sent to concentration camps during the Holocaust.\n\n[[Heinrich Himmler]] had initially been a supporter of R\u00f6hm, arguing that the charges of homosexuality against him were manufactured by Jews. But after the purge, Hitler elevated Himmler's status and he became very active in the suppression of homosexuality. He exclaimed: \"We must exterminate these people root and branch... the homosexual must be eliminated.\"<ref>Richard Plant, ''The Pink Triangle: The Nazi War against Homosexuals'' (New York: Holt, 1986), 99.</ref>\n\nShortly after the purge in 1934, a special division of the Gestapo was instituted to compile lists of gay individuals. In 1936, Himmler created the ''Reichszentrale zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der Homosexualit\u00e4t und Abtreibung'' ([[Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion]]).\n\nNazi Germany thought of German gay men as against the plan of creating a \"[[master race]]\" and sought to force them into sexual and social conformity.

Paragraph 175 read: \"An unnatural sex act committed between persons of male sex or by humans with animals is punishable by imprisonment; the loss of civil rights might also be imposed.\" The law was interpreted differently across the nation until the ruling of a court case on April 23, 1880. The ''[[Reichsgericht]]'' (Imperial Court of Justice) ruled that a criminal homosexual act had to involve either anal, oral, or [[intercrural sex]] between two men. Anything less than that was deemed harmless play.<ref>{{cite book|last=Giles|first=Geoffrey J|title=Social Outsiders in Nazi Germany|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=240}}</ref> The German police forces (until 1936 all policing was the responsibility of the ''L\u00e4nder'' governments) found this new interpretation of paragraph 175 extremely difficult to prove in court since it was hard to find witnesses to these acts. The enforcement of Paragraph 175 varied at times, with for instance a major and unprecedented crackdown on homosexuals being launched after the Eulenburg-Harden affair of 1906-09 led to a homophobic moral panic in Germany.<ref>Domeier, Norman ''The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire'', Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 pages 103\u2013104</ref> Enforcement also varied from ''land'' to ''land'' with Prussia under the leadership of the Social Democrat Otto Braun refusing to enforce Paragraph 175 from 1918 to 1932. As convictions often had to prove homosexual conduct that occurred in private, the interpretation of Paragraph 175 only resulted in approximately 500 convictions per annum. However, homosexuals often faced other forms of marginalization from chanteure, or blackmailers, through informal prosecution.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The racial state : Germany, 1933-1945|last=Burleigh, Michael, 1955-|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Wippermann, Wolfgang, 1945-, Mazal Holocaust Collection.|isbn=0521391148|location=Cambridge [England]|oclc=22597244|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Night of the Long Knives, the ''Reich'' Justice Minister [[Franz G\u00fcrtner]] (who was not a Nazi at the time) amended paragraph 175 due to what his government saw as loopholes in the law. The 1935 version of Paragraph 175 also declared any \"expression\" of homosexuality was now a criminal act. The most significant change to the law was the change from \"An unnatural sex act committed between persons of male sex\" to \"A male who commits a sex offense with another male.\" This expanded the reach of the law to persecute gay men. Kissing, mutual masturbation and love-letters between men served as a legitimate reason for the police to make an arrest.

Giles the [[SS]], and its leader [[Heinrich Himmler]], were particularly concerned about homosexuality.  More than any other Nazi leader, Himmler's writing and speeches denounced homosexuality. However, despite consistently condemning homosexuals and homosexual activity, Himmler was less consistent in his punishment of homosexuals.  In Geoffrey Giles' article \"The Denial of Homosexuality: Same-Sex Incidents in Himmler's SS\", several cases are put forward where members of the Nazi SS were tried for homosexual offences.  On a case by case basis, the outcomes vary widely, and Giles gives documented evidence where the judges could be swayed by evidence demonstrating the accused's \"[[aryan]]-ness\" or \"manliness\", that is, by describing him as coming from true Germanic stock and perhaps fathering children. Reasons for Himmler's leniency in some cases may derive from the difficulty in defining homosexuality, particularly in a society that glorifies the masculine ideal and brotherhood.<ref>Giles, Geoffrey J., \"The Denial of Homosexuality: Same-Sex Incidents in Himmler's SS\", Journal of the History of Sexuality, Vol. 11, No. 1/2, Special Issue: Sexuality and German Fascism (Jan. \u2013 Apr. 2002), pp. 256\u2013290</ref>\n\nNot only was Himmler's persecution of homosexuals based on this masculine ideal, but it was also driven by societal issues. On February 18, 1937 Himmler gave his most detailed speech on the topic in [[Bad T\u00f6lz]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Longerich|first=Peter|title=Heinrich Himmler|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=232}}</ref> Himmler starts his speech off covering the social aspect of the problem. He reminds his listeners of the number of registered members in homosexual associations. He was not convinced that every homosexual was registered in these clubs, but he was also not convinced everyone registered was a homosexual. Himmler estimated the number of homosexuals from one to two million people, or 7 to 10% of men in Germany. He explained \"If this remains the case, it means that our nation will be destroyed by this plague.\" Adding the number of homosexuals to the number of men that died in the previous war, Himmler estimated that this would equal four million men. If these four million men are no longer capable of having sex with a female, then this \"upsets the balance of the sexes in Germany and is leading to catastrophe\". Germany was having population issues with the number of killed men during the First World War. Himmler believed \"A people of good race which has too few children has a sure ticket for the grave, for insignificance in fifty to one hundred years, for burial in two hundred and fifty years.\"<ref name=speech>{{cite web|last=Himmler|first=Heinrich|title=Heinrich Himmler \u2013 Speech about Homosexuality to the SS Group Leaders|url=http://der-stuermer.org/english/Heinrich%20Himmler%20speech%20-%2018.02.1937.pdf|accessdate=2014-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Concentration camps==\n[[File:Sachsenhausen-hsexual-wyrd.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]]]\nHomosexuals were considered to be the lowest of the low in the concentration camp hierarchy.<ref name=H>{{cite journal| pmid=8905527 | doi=10.1300/J082v31n04_01 | volume=31 | issue=4 | title=Homosexual inmates in the Buchenwald Concentration Camp | year=1996 | journal=J Homosex | pages=1\u201328 | last1 = R\u00f6ll | first1 = W}}</ref> Estimates vary widely as to the number of gay men imprisoned in concentration camps during the Holocaust, ranging from 5,000 to 15,000, many of whom died.<ref name=USHM/> In addition, records as to the specific reasons for internment are non-existent in many areas, making it hard to put an exact number on exactly how many gay men perished in death camps.

Additionally, homosexuals in concentration camps lacked the ability to practice group solidarity, which aided other groups like political prisoners, for their morale. Peukert wrote the campaign to crush homosexuality together with the campaign against the \"asocials\" was approved of by \"wide sections of the population, including many who criticized the detention and torture of political opponents of the regime\".<ref>Peukert, Detlev ''Inside Nazi Germany'', New Haven, Yale, 1987 p.199.</ref> The marginalization of gay men in Germany was reflected in the camps. Many died from beatings, some of them inflicted by other prisoners. Experiences such as these can account for the high death rate of gay men in the camps as compared to the other \"asocial\" groups. A study by [[R\u00fcdiger Lautmann]] found that 60% of gay men in concentration camps died, as compared to 41% for political prisoners and 35% for [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

However the [[United Nations]] definition does not include sexual orientation (or even social and political groups) within its qualifications for the crime. Genocide by the U.N. definition is limited to national, ethnical, racial or religious groups and as this is the only accord to which nations have pledged allegiance, it stands as the dominant understanding of the term.<ref>David Scheffer, ''Genocide and Atrocity Crimes'', Genocide Studies and Prevention 1, no. 3 (2006)</ref> It is, however, what Michel-Rolph Trouillot terms \"an age when collective apologies are becoming increasingly common\"<ref>Michel-Rolph Trouillot, ''Abortive Rituals: Historical Apologies in the Global Era'', Interventions 2, (2000) pp. 172</ref> as well as a time when the established Holocaust discourse has settled and legitimized claims of the Jewish, Roma and mentally ill victims of Nazi persecution so it would seem an appropriate time to at least bring attention to the debate of the Gay Holocaust, even if the issue is not to be settled.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nA lack of research means that there is relatively little data on the dispersion of gay men throughout the camps. However, [[Heinz Heger]] suggests in his book ''The Men with the Pink Triangle'' that they were subjected to harsher labor than smaller targeted groups, such as the political prisoners, and furthermore suffered a much higher mortality rate.<ref name=\"Heinz Heger 1980 pp. 13\">Heinz Heger, ''The Men With the Pink Triangle'' (Hamburg: Melin-Verlag, 1980) pp. 13</ref> They also lacked a support network within the camps and were ostracized in the prison community.<ref name=\"Heinz Heger 1980 pp. 13\"/> Homosexuals, like the mentally ill and many Jews and Roma, were also subjected to medical experimentation in the hopes of finding a cure to homosexuality at the camp in Buchenwald.<ref>Heinz Heger, ''The Men With the Pink Triangle'' (Hamburg: Melin-Verlag, 1980) pp. 12</ref>\n\nThe Jews were the only group targeted by the Nazi regime for complete annihilation regardless of their identification or place of residence. However, Jews were not the only group to be targeted by the Nazis, leading to a debate as to whether other groups should be counted as Holocaust victims.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bauer |first1=Yehuda |title=Rethinking the Holocaust |date=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-09300-1 |ref=harv |location=New Haven|pp=49\u201350}}</ref> William J. Spurlin has suggested that restricting the definition of \"Holocaust\" to Jews fosters a misrepresentation of history and devalues the suffering of other victims of Nazi atrocities.

The shift from the traditional notion of history as the story of power and those who held it, [[Social history|social historians]] emerged with narratives of those who suffered and resisted these powers. [[African American]]s created their own narrative, as firmly based on evidence as the discourses already in existence, as part of a social movement towards civil rights based on a history of [[Racism in the United States|victimization and racism]]. Along similar lines, the [[LGBT social movements|gay and lesbian movement]] in the United States also utilized revisionism to write the narrative that had only just garnered an audience willing to validate it.<ref name=Stein>Arlene Stein, \"Whose Memories? Whose Victimhood? Contests for the Holocaust Frame in Recent Social Movement Discourse\", ''Sociological Perspectives''; 41, no. 3 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998)</ref>\n\nThere were two processes at work in this new discourse, revisionism and appropriation, which Arlene Stein teases out in her article ''Whose Memory, Whose Victimhood?'', both of which were used at different points in the movement for civil rights. The revisionist project was taken on in a variety of mediums, historical literature being only one of many. The play ''[[Bent (play)|Bent]]'' and a limited number of memoirs which recall ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' coincided with the appropriation of the [[pink triangle]] as a symbol of the new movement and a reminder to \"never forget\".<ref name=Stein/> While the focus of these early revisions was not necessarily to determine the Nazi policy on homosexuals as genocidal, they began a current towards legitimizing the victimization of homosexuals under the regime, a topic that had not been addressed until the 1970s.\n\nHistorical works would turn focus on the nature and intent of Nazi policy. [[Heinz Heger]], Gunter Grau and [[Richard Plant (writer)|Richard Plant]] all contributed greatly to the early Holocaust discourse which emerged throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.<ref name=Stein/> Central to these studies was the notion that statistically speaking, homosexuals suffered greater losses than many of the smaller minorities under Nazi persecution such as the [[Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses]] and within the camps experienced harsher treatments and ostracization as well as execution.<ref>Heinz Heger (1980).

Wellcome L0052822.jpg|thumb|A Silence=death poster from the AIDS crisis created by the Gran Fury illustrating the use of the inverted pink triangle from the Holocaust, 1987]]\nThese early revisionist discourses were joined by a popular movement of appropriation, which invoked the global memory of the Holocaust to shed light on social disparities for homosexuals within the United States. [[Larry Kramer]] who was one of the founders of [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]], an [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] activist group that used shock tactics to bring awareness to the disease and attention to the need for funding popularized the [[AIDS\u2013Holocaust metaphor|AIDS-as-Holocaust discourse]]. \"The slowness of government response at federal and local levels of government, the paucity of funds for research and treatment, particularly in the early days of the epidemic stems, Kramer argued, from deep-seated homophobic impulses and constituted 'intentional genocide'.\"<ref name=\"Arlene Stein 1998 pp. 527\">Arlene Stein, ''Whose Memories?

The poster was created by the [[Gran Fury]], a six-person collective in New York City. The collective, which included [[Avram Finkelstein]], aimed to use the power of art to bring awareness to and end the AIDS epidemic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filice|first=Eugenio|date=February 2005|title=Book Review: Outlaw Representation: Censorship and Homosexuality in Twentieth-Century American Art|journal=Sexualities|volume=8|issue=1|pages=116\u2013118|doi=10.1177/136346070500800113|issn=1363-4607}}</ref> The [[ACT UP]] organization used this image as a central component to their awareness campaign during the AIDS epidemic. Finkelstein described how the collective \"initially rejected the pink triangle because of its links to the Nazi concentration camps\" but ultimately \"returned to it for the same reason, inverting the triangle as a gesture of a disavowal of victimhood.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/11/22/silence-equals-death-poster|website=www.nypl.org|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> Even today, this symbol has continued to be used by the gay rights movement as the poster was recently featured on the [[Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art|Leslie Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art]] windows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leslielohman.org/project/silencedeath-collective|website=www.leslielohman.org|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gedenktafel Rosa Winkel Nollendorfplatz.jpg|thumb|Pink Triangle memorial to gay men persecuted by the Nazi regime in [[Nollendorfplatz]].]]\nThe Holocaust frame was used again in the early 1990s, this time in relation to [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] homophobic campaigns throughout the United States. The conservative response yielded a new discourse working against the ''Gay Holocaust'' academia, which emphasized the gay and lesbian revisionism as a victimist discourse which sought sympathy and recognition as a pragmatic means of garnering special status and civil rights outside those of the moral majority.<ref name=\"Arlene Stein 1998 pp. 527\"/> Arlene Stein identifies four central elements to the conservative reaction to the Gay Holocaust discourse: she argues that the right is attempting to dispel the notion that gays are victims, pit two traditionally liberal constituencies against one another (gays and Jews), thereby drawing parallels between Jews and Christians and legitimating its own status as an oppressed and morally upright group.\n\nThe victimist argument raises a central tenet as to the reasons for which the discourse of a ''Gay Holocaust'' has experienced so much resistance politically and popularly (in the conscious of the public). Alyson M. Cole addresses the anti-victim discourse that has emerged in western politics since the end of the 1980s. She asserts \"anti-victimists transformed discussions of social obligation, compensations and remedial or restorative procedures into criticisms of the alleged propensity of self-anointed victims to engage in objectionable conduct.\" Though she is clear that the anti-victimist discourse is not limited to right-wing politics, the case of the ''Gay Holocaust'' situates itself along these political boundaries and the anti-victim discourse is highly relevant to the debate on homosexual claims to genocide under [[Nazi Germany|the Third Reich]]. Cole refutes what she sees as problems in the anti-victim arguments.<ref name=\"Alyson Cole 2007\">Alyson Cole, \"Situating Anti-Victim Discourse,\" ''The Cult of True Victimhood: From The War on Welfare to the War on Terror'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2007)</ref>\n\n==Post-revisionist framing of the \"Gay Holocaust\"==\n{{one source|section|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Arnold Bastian.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial \"[[Stolpersteine|Stolperstein]]\" for Arnold Bastian, a homosexual victim of the Nazis.

Whilst site redevelopment plans were negotiated, the stadium remained derelict for several years until it was finally demolished in 2002. The site then became a private housing development known as Reynolds Gate, completed in 2008.\n\nPlans to build a new stadium for [[AFC Wimbledon]] on the nearby site of the [[Wimbledon Stadium|Wimbledon Greyhound track]], approximately 200 yards from the original Plough Lane stadium, were approved by Merton Council in December 2015.

The village is situated on a high mountain plateau at 1,800 meters (5,900 feet), surrounded by a total of 13 peaks above 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) which is the most in the Alps, forming the basis for its nickname ''the Pearl of the Alps''. It is a classic ski resort characterised by well-preserved Swiss wood architecture and a car-free city centre. The villages in its neighborhood are [[Saas-Almagell]], [[Saas-Grund]] and [[Saas-Balen]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Fee Glacier.JPG|thumb|left|Summer ski area in [[Mittelallalin]].

The community is considered to be a very attractive winter sport destination in the [[Swiss Alps]]. Typical activities include [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]], [[snowshoe]] trekking, [[canyoning|canyon climbing]] and [[ice climbing]].\n\nSaas-Fee offers 22 lifts, including 3 cable cars, 1 funicular railway ([[Metro Alpin]]), 5 gondolas (1 dedicated to walkers), 2 chairlifts, the remainder being surface lifts (draglifts). The ski run has a vertical drop of 1,800 m (5,906&nbsp;ft), a top elevation of 3,600 m (11,811&nbsp;ft) and covers {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} ({{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} beginner, {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} intermediate, {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} advanced). Other activities include [[paragliding]], [[hang gliding]], and [[tobogganing]].\n\nSaas-Fee can be reached by car or bus&mdash;postal buses run during much of the day half-hourly from [[Brig, Switzerland|Brig]] and [[Visp]], though none provides a service beyond the bus terminal through the length of the town during the winter. No cars are allowed to enter the city (they have to be parked in special car parks outside); only small electric vehicles operate on the streets between the hotels and ski area. The decision to exclude most motor vehicles was made by the village  at the time of the construction of the road from Saas Grund in 1951 in order to eliminate air pollution.<ref>[http://www.saas-fee.ch/pdf_doc/winter_e.pdf p5 Saas-Fee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115062525/http://www.saas-fee.ch/pdf_doc/winter_e.pdf |date=15 November 2008 }}, saas-fee.ch.</ref>\n\nThe resort offers many culture, sports and off-slope activities, including classical music, a sports and leisure complex, restaurants, and nightclubs. The resort features the highest underground [[funicular railway]] in the world up to the skiing area and the highest [[revolving restaurant]] in the world at 3,500 m (11,500 feet). The touristic slogan of Saas-Fee is \"Die Perle der Alpen\" (The Pearl of the Alps) as it is surrounded by a total of 13 peaks above 4,000 meters (13,123 feet), the most in the alps.

The ski run has a vertical drop of 1,800 m (5,906&nbsp;ft), a top elevation of 3,600 m (11,811&nbsp;ft) and covers {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} ({{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} beginner, {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} intermediate, {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} advanced). Other activities include [[paragliding]], [[hang gliding]], and [[tobogganing]].\n\nSaas-Fee can be reached by car or bus&mdash;postal buses run during much of the day half-hourly from [[Brig, Switzerland|Brig]] and [[Visp]], though none provides a service beyond the bus terminal through the length of the town during the winter. No cars are allowed to enter the city (they have to be parked in special car parks outside); only small electric vehicles operate on the streets between the hotels and ski area. The decision to exclude most motor vehicles was made by the village  at the time of the construction of the road from Saas Grund in 1951 in order to eliminate air polution.<ref>[http://www.saas-fee.ch/pdf_doc/winter_e.pdf p5 Saas-Fee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115062525/http://www.saas-fee.ch/pdf_doc/winter_e.pdf |date=15 November 2008 }}, saas-fee.ch.</ref>\n\nThe resort offers many culture, sports and off-slope activities, including classical music, a sports and leisure complex, restaurants, and nightclubs. The resort features the highest underground [[funicular railway]] in the world up to the skiing area and the highest [[revolving restaurant]] in the world at 3,500 m (11,500 feet).

The album was the first released by Petty after signing a contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]] (where he had recorded as part of the [[Traveling Wilburys]]) and the first of three albums produced by [[Rick Rubin]]. The album was certified 3\u00d7 platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\n== Background ==\nThe album features all members of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], with the exception of drummer [[Stan Lynch]]. Steve Ferrone plays drums on ''Wildflowers'' and would join the band officially the following year. However, the album was not credited to the Heartbreakers because, in Petty's words, \"Rick (Rubin) and I both wanted more freedom than to be strapped into five guys.\"<ref>Petty, Tom: ''Conversations with Tom Petty,'' page 142. Omnibus Press, 2005.</ref> Freedom notwithstanding, Petty chose to use most of his regular band as session players, demonstrating his comfort with that format. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed ''Wildflowers'' at number 12 on their list of the best albums of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-nineties-20110427/tom-petty-wildflowers-20110429|title=100 Best Albums of the Nineties: Tom Petty, 'Wildflowers' &#124; Rolling Stone &#124; Lists|date=|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2011-08-13}}</ref> ''[[Guitar World]]'' placed the album at number 49 in their \"Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994\" list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/superunknown-50-iconic-albums-defined-1994|title=Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994|date=July 14, 2014|work=[[Guitar World|GuitarWorld.com]]|accessdate=July 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715053900/http://www.guitarworld.com/superunknown-50-iconic-albums-defined-1994|archive-date=July 15, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFour singles were released from the album between 1994 and 1995, the most successful of which, \"[[You Don't Know How It Feels]]\", reached No. 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks|Album Rock Tracks]] chart for one week.

The album was the first released by Petty after signing a contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]] (where he had recorded as part of the [[Traveling Wilburys]]) and the first of three albums produced by [[Rick Rubin]]. The album was certified 3\u00d7 platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\n== Background ==\nThe album features all members of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], with the exception of drummer [[Stan Lynch]]. Steve Ferrone plays drums on ''Wildflowers'' and would join the band officially the following year. However, the album was not credited to the Heartbreakers because, in Petty's words, \"Rick (Rubin) and I both wanted more freedom than to be strapped into five guys.\"<ref>Petty, Tom: ''Conversations with Tom Petty,'' page 142. Omnibus Press, 2005.</ref> Freedom notwithstanding, Petty chose to use most of his regular band as session players, demonstrating his comfort with that format.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, never wronged the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nIt has been speculated that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents some sort of veiled secret, or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\".\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. But the narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike, jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room, on the very spot where the body is concealed, and suspect nothing, as the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses, telling them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.\n\nPoe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or ([[Anachronism|anachronistically]]) a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\">[[Christopher Benfey|Benfey, Christopher]]. \"Poe and the Unreadable: 'The Black Cat' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\", in ''New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed.

This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E. Arthur. \"Poe's 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\" in ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Poe's Tales'', edited by William L. Howarth. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall Inc., 1971, p. 94.</ref> Their denial of insanity is based on their systematic actions and their precision, as they provide a rational explanation for irrational behavior.<ref name=\"Cleman-p70\"/> This rationality, however, is undermined by their lack of motive (\"Object there was none. Passion there was none.\"). Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/>\n\nThe story's final scene shows the result of the narrator's feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending themself, their \"over-acuteness of the senses\", which help them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad.<ref name=\"Fisher-p87\">Fisher, Benjamin Franklin. \"Poe and the Gothic Tradition\", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Kevin J.

A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, never wronged the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nIt has been speculated that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents some sort of veiled secret, or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\".\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. But the narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike, jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room, on the very spot where the body is concealed, and suspect nothing, as the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses, telling them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male.

New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way.

Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature.

If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.
