Many [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) players played in Little League.\n\n==History==\nCarl Stotz, a resident of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, founded Little League Baseball in 1939. He began experimenting with his idea in the summer of 1938 when he gathered Carl's nephews, Jimmy and Major Gehron and their neighborhood friends. They tried different field dimensions over the course of the summer and played several informal games. The following summer they felt that they were ready to establish what later became Little League Baseball. The first league in Williamsport had just three teams, each sponsored by a different business. The first teams, Jumbo Pretzel, Lycoming Dairy, and Lundy Lumber, were managed by Carl Stotz, and brothers George and Bert Bebble. The men, joined by their wives and another couple, formed the first-ever Little League Board of Directors.<ref name=\"llbhistory\">{{cite web |url = http://www.littleleague.org/about/history.asp |title = History of Little League |accessdate = 2007-06-26 |publisher = Little League |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070514082459/http://www.littleleague.org/about/history.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-14}}</ref>\n\nThe first League game took place on June 6, 1939. Lundy Lumber defeated Lycoming Dairy, 23\u20138. Lycoming Dairy came back to claim the league [[championship]]. They, the first-half-season champions, defeated Lundy Lumber, the second-half champs, in a best-of-three season-ending [[playoff format|series]]. The following year a second league was formed in Williamsport, and from there Little League Baseball grew to become an international organization of nearly 200,000 teams in every U.S. state and over 80 countries around the world.<ref name=\"llbhistory\"/>\n\nFrom 1951 through 1973, Little League was for boys only. In 1974, Little League [[Regulation of sport|rules]] were revised to allow participation by girls in the baseball program following the result of a lawsuit filed by the [[National Organization for Women]] on behalf of [[Maria Pepe]].<ref>[http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/About_Our_Organization/historyandmission/chronology.htm Little League: History and Mission: Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224170800/http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/About_Our_Organization/historyandmission/chronology.htm |date=2009-02-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"mario_pepe_bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.littleleague.org/media/newsarchive/05_2004/04mariapepeopening.htm|title=Little League World Series Opening Ceremony to Mark 30th Anniversary of Decision Allowing Girls to Play|date=August 9, 2004|accessdate=2009-09-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607002311/http://www.littleleague.org/media/newsarchive/05_2004/04mariapepeopening.htm|archivedate=June 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, Robert Francis Morrison filed an official charter with Little League Baseball, Incorporated to admit the Cannon Street Y.M.C.A., as its first all-black team.

All 55 white teams eventually withdrew from the city and state tournament.  The Cannon Street All-Stars became the 1955 South Caroline state champions by forfeit.  However, they were informed by Little League president, Peter J. McGovern, that they would not be permitted to represent the state at the regional championships in Williamsport, GA. Little League executives invited the Cannon Street All-Stars to attend the tournament as guests to view the World Series that they were not permitted to play in.<ref name=\"Sport in American History\"/>\n\nAccording to the Little League Baseball and Softball participation statistics following the 2008 season, there were nearly 2.6 million players in Little League Baseball worldwide, including both boys and girls, including 400,000 registered in softball (also including both boys and girls). For tournament purposes, Little League Baseball is divided into 16 geographic regions; eight National and eight international. Each summer, Little League operates seven World Series tournaments at various locations throughout the U.S. (Little League softball and Junior, Senior, and Big League baseball and softball).\n\n===Timeline===\n\n====Early years====\n'''1939''': Little League is established by [[Carl E.

If the game is called prior to the completion of six innings, it is considered an official game if four innings have been completed (three and a half, if the home team leads); otherwise, if at least one inning has been completed, it is a suspended game.\n\nIn Intermediate Little League, as well as the Junior, Senior, and Big League levels (ages 13\u201318), a game is seven innings and is official if five innings have been completed.\n\n===Mandatory-play rule===\nIn all divisions except Senior and Big League, every player on the team roster must have at least one plate appearance and play six consecutive outs on defense in each game.  The penalty for a manager violating the rule is a two-game suspension.  This rule is waived if the game is completed prior to the usual duration of the game (six innings in Little League and below, seven innings in Intermediate Little League and Junior League).  This rule is modified during tournament play.  During tournament play, teams that have 13 or more players dressed at the field for a game are mandated to have one (1) \"At Bat\" during the game per player with no defensive requirement.  Teams that have 12 or fewer players dressed at the field for a tournament game require each player to receive one (1) \"At Bat\" plus six consecutive outs played in the field on defense.\n\n===Playing field===\nThe size of the field is dependent on the division of play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysite.verizon.net/rutherford.ll/rules2.htm|title=Pay Bill, See Offers, Check Email with My Verizon Fios|website=mysite.verizon.net|access-date=2009-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531162505/http://mysite.verizon.net/rutherford.ll/rules2.htm|archive-date=2009-05-31|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n'''Tee-ball'''\n:The distance between the bases is generally {{convert|50|ft|m|2}}.\n\n'''Minor League and Little League'''\n:The distance between the bases is {{convert|60|ft|m|2}} and the distance from the [[pitcher's mound]] to home plate is {{convert|46|ft|m|2}}.  Outfield fences must be at least {{convert|165|ft|m}} from home plate, but are usually {{convert|200|ft|m|-1}} or more (the fields at the Williamsport complex have fences 225 feet away).  The bases and pitching rubber are also slightly smaller than in standard baseball.{{Citation needed|reason=The field specification section of littleleague.org does not mention difference in base size|date=April 2014}} Also, unlike fields at almost all levels of competitive baseball for teenagers and adults, the distance between home plate and the outfield fence is constant throughout fair territory.\n\n'''Intermediate Little League'''\n:The distance between the bases is {{convert|70|ft|m|2}} and the distance from the pitcher's mound to home plate is {{convert|50|ft|m|2}}.  The recommended distance between home plate and the outfield fence ranges from {{convert|200|to(-)|275|ft|m|round=5}}; unlike regular Little League, the distances can vary within fair territory.  As in regular Little League, the bases and pitching rubber are also slightly smaller than in standard baseball.\n\n'''Junior League, Senior League, and Big League'''\n:The distance between the bases is {{convert|90|ft|m|2}}, the same as for regulation [[Major League Baseball]] fields. The distance between the pitcher's mound to home plate is {{convert|60.5|ft|m|2}}, also identical to that of MLB. The minimum outfield distance in the upper divisions is {{convert|300|ft|m}} (compare with MLB's official but not strictly enforced minimum of {{convert|325|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} at the foul lines), while the maximum for Big League is {{convert|425|ft|m}}.  (Base paths of {{convert|80|ft|m|2|disp=sqbr}} are optional for Junior League regular season play.)\n\n===Equipment===\n[[File:Little league baseball bunt.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Little Leaguer executing a bunt]]\n[[Baseball bat|Bats]] (all levels) may be made from wood or other materials (such as [[aluminum]]) and must be approved for use in Little League Baseball.  For the Majors Division and below, the maximum bat length is thirty-three (33) inches (838&nbsp;mm) and barrel diameter may not exceed {{convert|2+1/4|in|mm}}.

In the upper levels, including Intermediate Little League, the runner can leave the bag at any time while the ball is in play.\n\nIf a fielder is waiting at the base with the ball, an advancing runner must attempt to avoid contact.  A runner may not slide head-first except when retreating to a previously held base.\n\nIn the upper levels, runners must still make an attempt to avoid contact if possible, and may not maliciously initiate contact with a fielder.\n\n===Batting===\nThe upper limit of the [[strike zone]] extends to the batter's armpits.<ref>[http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/Newsletters/Fairball_Newsletters/2009/fbmay09/THESTRIKEZONE.htm THE STRIKE ZONE: Location, Location, Location] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614000727/http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/Newsletters/Fairball_Newsletters/2009/fbmay09/THESTRIKEZONE.htm |date=2009-06-14 }}, Little League\u00a9 ''Online''</ref>\n\nIn Tee-ball, Minor League, and Little League (if '[[uncaught third strike]]' rule is waived by the local league), the batter is out after the [[Strikeout|third strike]] regardless of whether the pitched ball is held by the catcher.  In Little League (both standard and Intermediate), Junior, Senior, and Big League, a batter may attempt to advance to first base on a dropped third strike if first base is unoccupied with less than two outs or if first base is unoccupied or occupied with two outs.\n\nIf the batter is hit by a pitch, the batter gets walked automatically. However, if the batter does not make an attempt to get out of the way of the pitched ball, the home-plate umpire may continue the at-bat.\n\n===Substitution===\nPlayers who have been substituted for may return to the game under certain conditions, though a player who is removed as pitcher may not return to pitch.\n\n===Pitchers===\n[[Pitcher]]s in all divisions are limited to a specific pitch count per game and a mandatory rest period between outings. These vary with age. The rest period also depends on the number of pitches thrown.<ref>[http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/rules/pitch_count_resource_page.htm Pitch Count Resource Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726152644/http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/rules/pitch_count_resource_page.htm |date=2008-07-26 }}, Little League\u00a9 ''Online''</ref>\n\nIf the pitcher hits too many batters with the ball, or intentionally hits the batter, he is ejected from the pitching spot.\n\n;Intentional base on balls\nHistorically, a pitcher could [[intentional base on balls|intentionally walk]] a batter by simply announcing his intent to do so and not have to actually throw any pitches. Beginning in 2008, the pitcher had to actually pitch the required four balls (which were counted against the pitch count). In 2017, the Major and Minor levels of Little League Baseball aligned with a new rule of Major League Baseball and allowed the pitcher to intentionally walk a batter simply by declaration.

The organization holds a [[congressional charter]] under [[Title 36 of the United States Code]].<ref>Section 130501(a) of [[Title 36 of the United States Code]] provides that Little League Baseball, Incorporated is a [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/36/130501 \"federally chartered corporation\"].</ref>\n\nThe organization's administrative office is located in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The first Little League Baseball World Series was played in Williamsport in 1947. The Little League International Complex hosts the annual [[Little League Baseball World Series]] at [[Howard J.

McGovern Little League Museum]], which provides a history of Little League Baseball and Softball through interactive exhibits for children. Many [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) players played in Little League.\n\n==History==\nCarl Stotz, a resident of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, founded Little League Baseball in 1939. He began experimenting with his idea in the summer of 1938 when he gathered Carl's nephews, Jimmy and Major Gehron and their neighborhood friends. They tried different field dimensions over the course of the summer and played several informal games. The following summer they felt that they were ready to establish what later became Little League Baseball. The first league in Williamsport had just three teams, each sponsored by a different business. The first teams, Jumbo Pretzel, Lycoming Dairy, and Lundy Lumber, were managed by Carl Stotz, and brothers George and Bert Bebble. The men, joined by their wives and another couple, formed the first-ever Little League Board of Directors.<ref name=\"llbhistory\">{{cite web |url = http://www.littleleague.org/about/history.asp |title = History of Little League |accessdate = 2007-06-26 |publisher = Little League |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070514082459/http://www.littleleague.org/about/history.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-14}}</ref>\n\nThe first League game took place on June 6, 1939. Lundy Lumber defeated Lycoming Dairy, 23-8. Lycoming Dairy came back to claim the league [[championship]]. They, the first-half-season champions, defeated Lundy Lumber, the second-half champs, in a best-of-three season-ending [[playoff format|series]]. The following year a second league was formed in Williamsport, and from there Little League Baseball grew to become an international organization of nearly 200,000 teams in every U.S. state and over 80 countries around the world.<ref name=\"llbhistory\"/>\n\nFrom 1951 through 1973, Little League was for boys only. In 1974, Little League [[Regulation of sport|rules]] were revised to allow participation by girls in the baseball program following the result of a lawsuit filed by the [[National Organization for Women]] on behalf of [[Maria Pepe]].<ref>[http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/About_Our_Organization/historyandmission/chronology.htm Little League: History and Mission: Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224170800/http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/About_Our_Organization/historyandmission/chronology.htm |date=2009-02-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"mario_pepe_bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.littleleague.org/media/newsarchive/05_2004/04mariapepeopening.htm|title=Little League World Series Opening Ceremony to Mark 30th Anniversary of Decision Allowing Girls to Play|date=August 9, 2004|accessdate=2009-09-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607002311/http://www.littleleague.org/media/newsarchive/05_2004/04mariapepeopening.htm|archivedate=June 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, Robert Francis Morrison filed an official charter with Little League Baseball, Incorporated to admit the Cannon Street Y.M.C.A., as its first all-black team.

All 55 white teams eventually withdrew from the city and state tournament.  The Cannon Street All-Stars became the 1955 South Caroline state champions by forfeit.  However, they were informed by Little League president, Peter J. McGovern, that they would not be permitted to represent the state at the regional championships in Williamsport, GA. Little League executives invited the Cannon Street All-Stars to attend the tournament as guests to view the World Series that they were not permitted to play in.<ref name=\"Sport in American History\"/>\n\nAccording to the Little League Baseball and Softball participation statistics following the 2008 season, there were nearly 2.6 million players in Little League Baseball worldwide, including both boys and girls, including 400,000 registered in softball (also including both boys and girls). For tournament purposes, Little League Baseball is divided into 16 geographic regions; eight National and eight international. Each summer, Little League operates seven World Series tournaments at various locations throughout the U.S. (Little League softball and Junior, Senior, and Big League baseball and softball).\n\n===Timeline===\n\n====Early years====\n'''1939''': Little League is established by [[Carl E.

The purpose of the division is to teach young children the basic fundamentals of hitting and fielding.<ref name=LL_divisions/>\n\n===Minor leagues===\n<!--Blatant copyright infringement removed; please do not re-add-->\nThe Minor League Baseball division is generally for children ages 7\u201311, with local leagues given the option to allow 6-year-old children to try out. Local leagues are permitted to further divide the Minor League division based on player age and/or experience, and often consist of coach-pitch (i.e., the batter's coach lightly pitching the ball) or machine-pitch at lower levels, with defensive players pitching at higher levels.<ref name=LL_divisions/>\n\n===9\u201310 year olds===\n\"The 9\u201310 Year Old Baseball Division for boys and girls was established as a tournament program in 1994. It gives children of this age the opportunity to experience tournament competition, up to state level. Players on these teams can be chosen from among Major Division and/or Minor Division teams.

The local league has an option to choose a Tournament Team (or 'All Stars') of 11\u201312-year-olds from within this division, and the team may enter the International Tournament.

If the game is called prior to the completion of six innings, it is considered an official game if four innings have been completed (three and a half, if the home team leads); otherwise, if at least one inning has been completed, it is a suspended game.\n\nIn Intermediate Little League, as well as the Junior, Senior, and Big League levels (ages 13\u201318), a game is seven innings and is official if five innings have been completed.\n\n===Mandatory-play rule===\nIn all divisions except Senior and Big League, every player on the team roster must have at least one plate appearance and play six consecutive outs on defense in each game.  The penalty for a manager violating the rule is a two-game suspension.  This rule is waived if the game is completed prior to the usual duration of the game (six innings in Little League and below, seven innings in Intermediate Little League and Junior League).  This rule is modified during tournament play.  During tournament play, teams that have 13 or more players dressed at the field for a game are mandated to have one (1) \"At Bat\" during the game per player with no defensive requirement.  Teams that have 12 or fewer players dressed at the field for a tournament game require each player to receive one (1) \"At Bat\" plus six consecutive outs played in the field on defense.\n\n===Playing field===\nThe size of the field is dependent on the division of play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysite.verizon.net/rutherford.ll/rules2.htm|title=Pay Bill, See Offers, Check Email with My Verizon Fios|website=mysite.verizon.net|access-date=2009-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531162505/http://mysite.verizon.net/rutherford.ll/rules2.htm|archive-date=2009-05-31|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n'''Tee-ball'''\n:The distance between the bases is generally {{convert|50|ft|m|2}}.\n\n'''Minor League and Little League'''\n:The distance between the bases is {{convert|60|ft|m|2}} and the distance from the [[pitcher's mound]] to home plate is {{convert|46|ft|m|2}}.  Outfield fences must be at least {{convert|165|ft|m}} from home plate, but are usually {{convert|200|ft|m|-1}} or more (the fields at the Williamsport complex have fences 225 feet away).  The bases and pitching rubber are also slightly smaller than in standard baseball.{{Citation needed|reason=The field specification section of littleleague.org does not mention difference in base size|date=April 2014}} Also, unlike fields at almost all levels of competitive baseball for teenagers and adults, the distance between home plate and the outfield fence is constant throughout fair territory.\n\n'''Intermediate Little League'''\n:The distance between the bases is {{convert|70|ft|m|2}} and the distance from the pitcher's mound to home plate is {{convert|50|ft|m|2}}.  The recommended distance between home plate and the outfield fence ranges from {{convert|200|to(-)|275|ft|m|round=5}}; unlike regular Little League, the distances can vary within fair territory.  As in regular Little League, the bases and pitching rubber are also slightly smaller than in standard baseball.\n\n'''Junior League, Senior League, and Big League'''\n:The distance between the bases is {{convert|90|ft|m|2}}, the same as for regulation [[Major League Baseball]] fields. The distance between the pitcher's mound to home plate is {{convert|60.5|ft|m|2}}, also identical to that of MLB. The minimum outfield distance in the upper divisions is {{convert|300|ft|m}} (compare with MLB's official but not strictly enforced minimum of {{convert|325|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} at the foul lines), while the maximum for Big League is {{convert|425|ft|m}}.  (Base paths of {{convert|80|ft|m|2|disp=sqbr}} are optional for Junior League regular season play.)\n\n===Equipment===\n[[File:Little league baseball bunt.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Little Leaguer executing a bunt]]\n[[Baseball bat|Bats]] (all levels) may be made from wood or other materials (such as [[aluminum]]) and must be approved for use in Little League Baseball.  For the Majors Division and below, the maximum bat length is thirty-three (33) inches (838&nbsp;mm) and barrel diameter may not exceed {{convert|2+1/4|in|mm}}.  Beginning in 2009 all Little League bats must be labeled with a Bat Performance Factor (BPF) of 1.15 or lower.\n\nBats for the Junior League level may have a maximum length of thirty-four (34) inches (864&nbsp;mm) and a maximum barrel diameter of {{convert|2+5/8|in|mm}}.  Bats for the Big and Senior League levels may have a maximum length of thirty-six (36) inches (914&nbsp;mm) and a maximum barrel diameter of {{convert|2+5/8|in|mm}}.  Non-wood Big and Senior League bats must meet the Batted Ball Coefficient of Restitution (BBCOR) testing standards that are currently used in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] (high school).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webusers.npl.uiuc.edu/~a-nathan/pob/BESRWhitePaper.pdf|title=The BESR (Ball Exit Speed Ratio)|accessdate=31 August 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029095447/http://webusers.npl.uiuc.edu/~a-nathan/pob/BESRWhitePaper.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2008}}</ref> Intermediate Little League bats must meet Junior League specifications.\n\n===Base running===\nWhen the pitcher is ready to pitch, a baserunner may not leave the bag until the pitch reaches the batter in Minor League and standard Little League. In the upper levels, including Intermediate Little League, the runner can leave the bag at any time while the ball is in play.\n\nIf a fielder is waiting at the base with the ball, an advancing runner must attempt to avoid contact.  A runner may not slide head-first except when retreating to a previously held base.\n\nIn the upper levels, runners must still make an attempt to avoid contact if possible, and may not maliciously initiate contact with a fielder.\n\n===Batting===\nThe upper limit of the [[strike zone]] extends to the batter's armpits.<ref>[http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/Newsletters/Fairball_Newsletters/2009/fbmay09/THESTRIKEZONE.htm THE STRIKE ZONE: Location, Location, Location] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614000727/http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/Newsletters/Fairball_Newsletters/2009/fbmay09/THESTRIKEZONE.htm |date=2009-06-14 }}, Little League\u00a9 ''Online''</ref>\n\nIn Tee-ball, Minor League, and Little League (if '[[uncaught third strike]]' rule is waived by the local league), the batter is out after the [[Strikeout|third strike]] regardless of whether the pitched ball is held by the catcher.  In Little League (both standard and Intermediate), Junior, Senior, and Big League, a batter may attempt to advance to first base on a dropped third strike if first base is unoccupied with less than two outs or if first base is unoccupied or occupied with two outs.\n\nIf the batter is hit by a pitch, the batter gets walked automatically. However, if the batter does not make an attempt to get out of the way of the pitched ball, the home-plate umpire may continue the at-bat.\n\n===Substitution===\nPlayers who have been substituted for may return to the game under certain conditions, though a player who is removed as pitcher may not return to pitch.\n\n===Pitchers===\n[[Pitcher]]s in all divisions are limited to a specific pitch count per game and a mandatory rest period between outings. These vary with age. The rest period also depends on the number of pitches thrown.<ref>[http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/rules/pitch_count_resource_page.htm Pitch Count Resource Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726152644/http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/rules/pitch_count_resource_page.htm |date=2008-07-26 }}, Little League\u00a9 ''Online''</ref>\n\nIf the pitcher hits too many batters with the ball, or intentionally hits the batter, he is ejected from the pitching spot.\n\n;Intentional base on balls\nHistorically, a pitcher could [[intentional base on balls|intentionally walk]] a batter by simply announcing his intent to do so and not have to actually throw any pitches. Beginning in 2008, the pitcher had to actually pitch the required four balls (which were counted against the pitch count). In 2017, the Major and Minor levels of Little League Baseball aligned with a new rule of Major League Baseball and allowed the pitcher to intentionally walk a batter simply by declaration. The intentional walk adds four to the pitcher's pitch count.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.llumpires.com/2017-little-league-rule-regulation-changes/\n|title=2017 Little League Rule and Regulation Changes\n|publisher=LLUmpires.com\n|date=2017-03-13\n|accessdate=2017-05-17\n}}</ref> This change rescinded a former rule in which the team at bat could decline the award of first base and force the pitcher to pitch, to further increase the pitch count against the pitcher.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://theseason.gc.com/basbeall-new-little-league-intentional-walk-rules-change-strategy\n|title=New Little League Intentional Walk Rules Change Strategy\n|publisher=GameChanger\n|date=2017-02-22\n|accessdate=2017-05-17\n}}</ref>\n\n===Local options===\nLocal leagues have a certain amount of flexibility.  For example, a league may opt to use the \"continuous batting order\" rule (4.04), under which each player on the team's roster bats, even when not in the defensive lineup.

Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarking.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>\n\nOf the 7 whole or reconstructed vessels, 5 are of the type Fifield Bold, one of Huber Trailed, and one that is stylistically different from either Fisher or Huber.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n18 different rim profile types were identified but almost all of them are everted, mostly sharply everted, and 4 types make up the vast majority of vessels.  The most common type is sharply everted with flat lip; the other most common forms are sharply everted with pointed lip, sharply everted and lip thickened to the interior, and sharply everted with flat lip thickened to the exterior.  The most common form of decoration observed on body sherds was medium parallel lines.  This was true for both plain and cordmarked surfaces but the trend was more pronounced with the cordmarked surfaces.  Wide-notched lip decoration was most common; many were medium notched or unnotched but few were fine-notched.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nFollowing Faulkner's typology,<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n* Huber Plain - 62.5%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 6%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 1.5%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 23.5%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - about 5% of the assemblage was identified as belonging to the Fisher tradition, another [[Upper Mississippian]] culture which existed in the southern [[Great Lakes]] and was at least partially coterminous with Huber. Fisher pottery is characterized by shell-tempering and predominantly [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surfaces, often decorated with curvilinear designs.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  4% of Fisher sherds/vessels were classified as Fifield Trailed and 1% were Fiflield Bold.\n* Other types - 1%\n\n=== Chronology of Hoxie Farm pottery within the Huber sequence ===\n\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age. Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips. Late Huber pottery has predominately smooth surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\">{{cite book |last1=Bettarel |first1=Robert Louis |last2=Smith |first2=Hale G. |title=The Moccasin Bluff Site and the Woodland Cultures of Southwestern Michigan |date=1973 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, Anthropological Papers no. 49 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref>\n\nIn the Hoxie Farm site assemblage, 23.5%  of sherds are cordmarked, which is more than on any other Huber Culture site. Fine-line decoration is present on only 13% of decorated sherds. Also, only 20% of the lips are unnotched, compared to 49% at [[Huber Site|Huber]]<ref name=\"Herold\"/> and 45% at Oak Forest.<ref name=\"Michalik\">{{cite book |last1=Michalik |first1=Laura K. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 10: Ceramic Artifacts}}</ref> This indicates a relatively early time placement for Hoxie Farm within the Huber sequence.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n== Huber Phase within the Upper Mississippian Culture ==\n\nHuber ware (and Huber culture) are often mentioned together with Fisher.  Both Fisher and Huber are Upper Mississippian cultures which existed in the southern Lake Michigan region in the states of northern Illinois and Indiana and southwest Michigan.  Both have shell-tempered pottery but Huber is predominantly plain surface with fine-line decoration and Fisher is predominantly cordmarked surface with wide-line decoration.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |last2=Asch |first2=David L. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 4: Cultural Setting: the Oneota Tradition}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship of Huber and Fisher both with each other and with other Upper Mississippian cultures in the area has long been a matter of debate and speculation among archaeologists.  James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations, felt that Huber was a Component of the Oneota Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the only one that has been found in association with early Historic European trade goods.  Nevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.  Hoxie Farm, Griesmer and Moccasin Bluff are examples of this.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the Oneota tradition.  The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like Fifield, where Fisher pottery is associated with late Prehistoric artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the Protohistoric or early Historic period.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe artifacts present at Hoxie Farm represent a well-rounded view of life in the Huber culture.  Several items of personal adornment were found here, such as hair accessories, bracelets, and pendants.  Domestic items include knives, scrapers, chisels, needles, and awls.  The bone or antler dice implies games or gambling went on at the site; gambling among Native American tribes has been well-documented.  A bone rasp indicates music was being performed for entertainment or for ceremonial purposes.  The presence of stemmed pipes and several pieces of art with magical or spiritual overtones reflects on the spiritual life of the community.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nThere is direct evidence of cultivated plants at Hoxie Farm. The remains of [[maize]] were found along with hoes made of bison scapula and elk scapula.  Deer bone was also present in abundance, along with arrowheads for bows-and-arrows, indicating the site residents still relied on hunting; and fish and turtle were also present in the animal bone remains, so they were also exploiting food resources of the nearby marshes and creeks.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nWith regards to seasonality of occupation, based on an analysis of the animal bone remains, the researchers determined the site was occupied from at least spring through fall.  In fact the site may have been occupied year-round since there are storage pits to keep food during the winter.  The presence of non-utilitarian items for music, games and religion also implies an extended residence.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nDespite the fact that the Hoxie Farm site had European trade goods and thus was occupied at a very late date in prehistory, the pottery traits indicate an early placement in the Huber sequence.  The answer may be that the site was occupied longer than the other Huber sites, and therefore the pottery from the entire Huber sequence is present, with early and late types intermixed.  Since the site was not stratified, there was no way for the researchers to segregate artifacts from different time periods.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{citation | editor = James A.

It is usually very plentiful at a site and the details of manufacture and decoration are very sensitive indicators of time, space and culture.<ref name=\"Shepard\">{{cite book |last1=Shepard |first1=Anna O. |title=Ceramics for the Archaeologist |date=1954 |publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington, Publication 609 |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Huber tradition was well known by archaeologists for decades following the original excavations at the [[Huber Site|Huber site]],<ref name=\"Griffin\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=James Bennett |title=The Fort Ancient Aspect: Its Cultural and Chronological Position in Mississippi Valley Archaeology |date=1943 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref> a formalized [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] was not developed until Charles Faulkner devised one in his 1972 report on the Griesmer site in northwestern [[Indiana]],<ref name=\"Faulkner\">{{cite journal |last1=Faulkner |first1=Charles H. |title=The Late Prehistoric Occupation of Northwestern Indiana: A Study of the Upper Mississippian Cultures of the Kankakee Valley |journal=Prehistory Research Series |date=1972 |volume=V |issue=1 |pages=1\u2013222}}</ref> just to the east of Chicago.\n\nHuber [[pottery]] is characterized by shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]], smooth surface pottery with globular vessel shape and restricted orifices with everted rims.  Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarking.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>\n\nOf the 7 whole or reconstructed vessels, 5 are of the type Fifield Bold, one of Huber Trailed, and one that is stylistically different from either Fisher or Huber.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n18 different rim profile types were identified but almost all of them are everted, mostly sharply everted, and 4 types make up the vast majority of vessels.  The most common type is sharply everted with flat lip; the other most common forms are sharply everted with pointed lip, sharply everted and lip thickened to the interior, and sharply everted with flat lip thickened to the exterior.  The most common form of decoration observed on body sherds was medium parallel lines.  This was true for both plain and cordmarked surfaces but the trend was more pronounced with the cordmarked surfaces.  Wide-notched lip decoration was most common; many were medium notched or unnotched but few were fine-notched.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nFollowing Faulkner's typology,<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n* Huber Plain - 62.5%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 6%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 1.5%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 23.5%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - about 5% of the assemblage was identified as belonging to the Fisher tradition, another [[Upper Mississippian]] culture which existed in the southern [[Great Lakes]] and was at least partially coterminous with Huber. Fisher pottery is characterized by shell-tempering and predominantly [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surfaces, often decorated with curvilinear designs.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  4% of Fisher sherds/vessels were classified as Fifield Trailed and 1% were Fiflield Bold.\n* Other types - 1%\n\n=== Chronology of Hoxie Farm pottery within the Huber sequence ===\n\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age. Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips. Late Huber pottery has predominately smooth surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\">{{cite book |last1=Bettarel |first1=Robert Louis |last2=Smith |first2=Hale G. |title=The Moccasin Bluff Site and the Woodland Cultures of Southwestern Michigan |date=1973 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, Anthropological Papers no. 49 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref>\n\nIn the Hoxie Farm site assemblage, 23.5%  of sherds are cordmarked, which is more than on any other Huber Culture site. Fine-line decoration is present on only 13% of decorated sherds. Also, only 20% of the lips are unnotched, compared to 49% at [[Huber Site|Huber]]<ref name=\"Herold\"/> and 45% at Oak Forest.<ref name=\"Michalik\">{{cite book |last1=Michalik |first1=Laura K. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 10: Ceramic Artifacts}}</ref> This indicates a relatively early time placement for Hoxie Farm within the Huber sequence.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n== Huber Phase within the Upper Mississippian Culture ==\n\nHuber ware (and Huber culture) are often mentioned together with Fisher.  Both Fisher and Huber are Upper Mississippian cultures which existed in the southern Lake Michigan region in the states of northern Illinois and Indiana and southwest Michigan.  Both have shell-tempered pottery but Huber is predominantly plain surface with fine-line decoration and Fisher is predominantly cordmarked surface with wide-line decoration.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |last2=Asch |first2=David L. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 4: Cultural Setting: the Oneota Tradition}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship of Huber and Fisher both with each other and with other Upper Mississippian cultures in the area has long been a matter of debate and speculation among archaeologists.  James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations, felt that Huber was a Component of the Oneota Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the only one that has been found in association with early Historic European trade goods.  Nevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.  Hoxie Farm, Griesmer and Moccasin Bluff are examples of this.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the Oneota tradition.  The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like Fifield, where Fisher pottery is associated with late Prehistoric artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the Protohistoric or early Historic period.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe artifacts present at Hoxie Farm represent a well-rounded view of life in the Huber culture.  Several items of personal adornment were found here, such as hair accessories, bracelets, and pendants.  Domestic items include knives, scrapers, chisels, needles, and awls.  The bone or antler dice implies games or gambling went on at the site; gambling among Native American tribes has been well-documented.  A bone rasp indicates music was being performed for entertainment or for ceremonial purposes.  The presence of stemmed pipes and several pieces of art with magical or spiritual overtones reflects on the spiritual life of the community.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nThere is direct evidence of cultivated plants at Hoxie Farm. The remains of [[maize]] were found along with hoes made of bison scapula and elk scapula.  Deer bone was also present in abundance, along with arrowheads for bows-and-arrows, indicating the site residents still relied on hunting; and fish and turtle were also present in the animal bone remains, so they were also exploiting food resources of the nearby marshes and creeks.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nWith regards to seasonality of occupation, based on an analysis of the animal bone remains, the researchers determined the site was occupied from at least spring through fall.  In fact the site may have been occupied year-round since there are storage pits to keep food during the winter.  The presence of non-utilitarian items for music, games and religion also implies an extended residence.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nDespite the fact that the Hoxie Farm site had European trade goods and thus was occupied at a very late date in prehistory, the pottery traits indicate an early placement in the Huber sequence.  The answer may be that the site was occupied longer than the other Huber sites, and therefore the pottery from the entire Huber sequence is present, with early and late types intermixed.  Since the site was not stratified, there was no way for the researchers to segregate artifacts from different time periods.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{citation | editor = James A.

It is one of the most important musical instruments of the [[Mongols|Mongol people]], and is considered a symbol of the Mongolian nation. The morin khuur is one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] identified by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]].\n\n== Name ==\nIn English usually called '''''morin khuur''''' (approx \"MORE-een HOOR\") or translated as \"horsehead fiddle\" (although the more literal translation would be just \"horse fiddle\" (or \"horse stringed-instrument\") --\"'Morin'\"=\"horse\", \"'khuur'\"=\"fiddle\"/\"stringed-instrument\").\n\nThe full [[Classical Mongolian]] name for the morin khuur is ''morin tolo\u03b3ai tai qu\u03b3ur'',  {{MongolUnicode|\u182e\u1823\u1837\u1822\u1828<br />\u1832\u1823\u182f\u1823\u182d\u1820\u1822 \u1832\u1820\u1822<br />\u182c\u1823\u182d\u1823\u1837}}, (which in modern [[Khalkh]] [[cyrillic]] is \u041c\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d \u0442\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0439\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0445\u0443\u0443\u0440) meaning ''fiddle with a horse's head''.

Accessed 23 April 2010.</ref>\n\n== Construction ==\nThe instrument consists of a [[trapezoid|trapeziform]] wooden-framed sound box to which two strings are attached.  It is held nearly upright with the sound box in the musician's lap or between the musician's legs. The strings are made from hairs from nylon or horses' tails,<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Morin khuur\n| url = http://www.silkroadproject.org/MusicArtists/Instruments/Morinkhuur/tabid/318/Default.aspx\n| publisher = www.silkroadproject.org\n| accessdate = 2010-04-24\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019144259/http://www.silkroadproject.org/MusicArtists/Instruments/Morinkhuur/tabid/318/Default.aspx\n| archive-date = 2013-10-19\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> strung parallel, and run over a wooden bridge on the body up a long neck, past a second smaller bridge, to the two tuning pegs in the scroll, which is usually carved into the form of a horse's head.\n[[File:Horsehair fiddles.jpg|alt=WOMADelaide festival Adelaide, Australia 2012|thumb|At WOMADelaide festival in [[Adelaide, Australia]] in 2012.]]\nThe bow is loosely strung with horse hair coated with [[larch]] or cedar wood resin, and is held from underneath with the right hand.  The underhand grip enables the hand to tighten the loose hair of the bow, allowing very fine control of the instrument's [[timbre]].\n\nThe larger of the two strings (the \"male\" string) has 130 hairs from a [[stallion (horse)|stallion]]'s tail, while the \"female\" string has 105 hairs from a [[mare (horse)|mare]]'s tail. Nowadays the strings are made of nylon. Traditionally, the strings were tuned a [[perfect fifth|fifth]] apart, though in modern music they are more often tuned a [[perfect fourth|fourth]] apart, usually to B-flat and F. The strings are stopped either by pinching them in the joints of the index and middle fingers, or by pinching them between the nail of the little finger and the pad of the ring finger.\n\nTraditionally, the frame is covered with [[camel]], [[goat]], or [[sheep]] skin, in which case a small opening would be left in the back. However, since the 1970s, new completely wooden sound box instruments have appeared, with carved [[f-hole]]s similar to European stringed instruments.<ref>CD booklet notes, ''Mongolia: Traditional Music'', 1991, Auvidis-UNESCO D 8207</ref>\n\nThe modern standard height is {{convert|1.15|m|abbr=on}}; the distance between the upper bridge and the lower bridge is about {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}}, but the upper bridge especially can be adapted to match smaller player's fingers. The sound box usually has a depth of {{convert|8|\u2013|9|cm|abbr=on}}; the width of the soundbox is about {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}} at the top and {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on}} at the bottom. Good quality instruments can achieve a strength of 85&nbsp;dBA, which allows it to be played (if desired) even in [[mezzo forte (musical notation)|mezzoforte]] or [[crescendo]]. When horsehair is used, the luthiers prefer to use the hair of white stallions. In general the quality of a horse hair string depends on its preparation, the climate conditions and the nutrition of the animals. That gives a wide area of quality differences.\n\nQuality nylon strings (Khalkh Mongolian: {{lang|mn|\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043d \u0445\u044f\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0441}}) last for up to 2 years, but only if prepared and placed properly on the instrument. Most beginners don't comb the strings, then the sound quality worsens quickly. Good strings nearly sound like steel strings, and in spectrograms they show about 7-8 harmonics.\n\nMorin khuur vary in form depending on region. Instruments from central [[Mongolia]] tend to have larger bodies and thus possess more volume than the smaller-bodied instruments of [[Inner Mongolia]]. Also the Inner Mongolian instruments have mostly mechanics for tightening the strings, where Mongolian luthiers mostly use wooden pegs in a slightly conic shape.  In [[Tuva]], the morin khuur is sometimes used in place of the [[igil]].\n\n== Origin ==\n{{Listen\n| pos         = left\n| filename    = Morin_khuur_sound.ogg\n| title       = \"Buyant Altai Khairkhan\" (Altai Khairkhan, 2000)\n| description = The sound of a morin khuur\n}}\n\n[[Image:Morin Khuur, South Mongolian Style.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Morin khuur, [[Inner Mongolia]]n style in China]]\n\nOne legend about the origin of the morin khuur is that a shepherd named Namjil the Cuckoo received the gift of a flying horse; he would mount it at night and fly to meet his beloved. A jealous woman had the horse's wings cut off, so that the horse fell from the air and died. The grieving shepherd made a horsehead fiddle from the now-wingless horse's skin and tail hair, and used it to play poignant songs about his horse.\n\nAnother legend credits the invention of the morin khuur to a boy named S\u00fckhe (or Suho). After a wicked lord slew the boy's prized white horse, the horse's spirit came to S\u00fckhe in a dream and instructed him to make an instrument from the horse's body, so the two could still be together and neither would be lonely. So the first morin khuur was assembled, with horse bones as its neck, horsehair strings, horse skin covering its wooden soundbox, and its scroll carved into the shape of a horse head.\n\nThe fact that most of the eastern [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] neighbors of the [[Mongols]] possess similar horse hair instruments (such as the [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] [[igil]], the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] [[kobyz]], or the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] [[Kyl kyyak]]), though not western [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], may point to a possible origin amongst peoples that once inhabited the [[Mongolian Steppe]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and migrated to what is now Tuva, [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].\n\nThe [[gusle]] from [[Southeastern Europe]] (Serbia, Croatia & Albania) is a very similar instrument, and may indicate this is an extremely ancient instrument perhaps even dating back to the outward migration of people out of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] some 40,000 years ago. Often these instruments are depicted with a goat head instead of a horse in Europe.\n\n== Playing technique ==\n[[File:Morin khuur in one of the Buryat villages in the Zakamensky district of Buryatia.jpg|thumb|Morin khuur in one of the Buryat villages in the Zakamensky district of Buryatia]]\n\nThe modern style Morin Khuur is played with nearly natural finger [[position (music)|positions]]. That means, the distance between two fingers usually make the distance of a [[semitone|half tone]] on the lower section of the instrument. On the tune F / B{{music|b}} the index finger hits on the low (F)  string the G, the middle finger hits the G{{music|#}}, the ring finger hits the A, the little finger the B flat. Identical positions are on the high strings - C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}. The little finger tips the B strings under the F string, while all other fingers touch the strings from the top.\n\nMelodies are usually played from F to F' on the F string, then the player switches to the B{{music|b}} string and continues with G, A, B{{music|b}}. There are 3 hand positions on the F string, and 2 positions on the B{{music|b}} strings a musician must memorize. The idea is that without moving the string hand too much the sound quality improves. The 2nd hand position on the B string is used to play C, D, E{{music|b}}, then moves a little bit for hitting the F' with the little finger, then without moving the G position can be reached with the 1st finger.\n\nIt is also possible to touch the B{{music|b}} string with the thumb to get a C, and use the ring finger under the F string to achieve the D{{music|#}}.\n\nOn the F strings only the first [[harmonic]] is used, so the scale ranges from F to F'. On the B{{music|b}} strings several harmonics are available: B{{music|b}}', F\", B\", also often players accompanying the F' on the F string with an F\" [[overtone]] at the F' position on the B{{music|b}} string.\n\nSome parts of the bowing technique is unique - the little and the ring finger of the right hand usually touch the bow hair, which is used for setting accents. The other two fingers maintain a slight pressure on the strings. A common technique with other string instruments is the \"Kist\". When the bow direction changes, the right hand moves a little bit in advance to the opposite direction to avoid scratchy sounds and for achieving a better voice. When pushing the bow the hand closes a little bit in direction of a fist, when pulling it the hand opens - nearly to a right angle between the arm and the fingers.\n\nThe instrument can be used for playing western style classical music, or Mongolian style pieces. The primary education is to learn the scales, to train the ear for achieving the \"[[muscle memory]]\", the ability to automatically adapt the finger position when a note wasn't hit properly. The main goal is to achieve a \"clear\" sound, that means no change in volume or frequency is desired. That depends on three main facts:\n\n- finger force used for touching the strings\n- pressure of the bow\n- constant sound after bow direction changes\n\nAs variation are usually used the \"[[accent (music)|accent]]\" and the \"[[vibrato]]\". Other techniques like the \"[[Col legno]]\", the \"[[Pizzicato]]\" or the \"[[Martellato]]\" are generally not used on the Morin Huur.\n\nBecause of its standard tune to Bb and F mostly western music is transposed for being played in one of the four most common scales: F major, F minor, B{{music|b}} Major, E{{music|b}} major. When used as a solo instrument the Morin Huur is often tuned a half tone higher or lower.\n\nNearly all of the Mongolian style pieces are in F minor, and often the instrument is tuned 1-2 notes lower for coming closer to the tunes used in the deep past. The instruments in the pre-socialist era of Mongolia were usually covered with skin, which mostly doesn't allow the Bb and F tune - usually tuned 2-4 notes deeper.\n\nOn the contemporary Morin Khuur the deep string is placed at the right side and the high string is placed at the left side, seen from the front of the instrument. The Igil has the opposite placement of strings, so a player has to adapt in order to play pieces made for the other one. For contemporary teaching the modern style is in use.\n\n== Education ==\n\nIn Mongolia the morin khuur can be learned at three schools:\n* The SUIS ({{lang|mn|\u0441\u043e\u0451\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0443\u0440\u043b\u0430\u0433\u044b\u043d \u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0443\u043b\u044c}}), engl. \"university of arts and culture\". Here students enter in adult age for obtaining a bachelor's degree after 2 years and a master's degree after 5 years of musical education. After the master's degree the students are considered to be professional musicians, and can play at one of the state ensembles or later become a teacher at the SUIS.\n* Mongolian State Conservatory ({{lang|mn|\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b \u0423\u043b\u0441\u044b\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438}}). Accepting students who are not older than 10 years old for the morin khuur class at the conservatory and since September 2017, the conservatory has been offering Bachelor of Music and Master of Music in Morin Khuur Performance degree.\n* The culture school of the SUIS ({{lang|mn|\u0421\u0423\u0418\u0421\u044b, \u0441\u043e\u0451\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0441\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0443\u043b\u044c}}). Here several qualification courses are available. Graduates from this school mostly become teachers or enter the SUIS.\n\nAlso many amateur players acquired reasonable skills by taking lessons from private teachers, or being taught by their parents or other relatives.\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n\nThe morin khuur is the national instrument in Mongolia. Many festivals are held for celebrating the importance of this instrument on the Mongolian culture, like the biannual \"International Morin Huur Festival and competition\", which is organized by the \"World Morinhuur Association\". First held in 2008, second in 2010 - with 8 participating countries (Mongolia, Korea, China, Russia, USA, Germany, France, Japan) - and planned for May 2012. Here many amateurs come and play freestyle pieces, but also a professional contest is held and an instrument making competition.\n\nDuring June the \"roaring hooves\" festival is held. This is a small festival for professional skilled players - but unfortunately a closed festival. These recordings are often shown in TV reports later.\n\nOn the national festival \"Naadam\" praise songs are played for the most magnificent horse and for the highest ranked wrestler and archer. The songs are called \"Magtaal\" and accompanied by a unique style of praise and morin khuur.\n\nMany Mongolians have the instrument in their home because it is a symbol for peace and happiness.\n\nDuring the winter time, but also in beginning of the spring time a morin khuur player is called in for the \"\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440 \u04af\u0440\u0433\u044d\u044d\u0445\", the \"ceremony for scaring away the frost\". In general many traditional pieces are played, divided in the different styles: \"\u0443\u0440\u0442\u044b\u043d \u0434\u0443\u0443\", \"urtiin duu\" (long song), \"\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0442\u0430\u0430\u043b\", \"magtaal\" (praise songs) and \"\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\", \"tatlaga\" (solo pieces, mostly imitiating horses or camels).\n\nThe fourth style, the \"\u0431\u0438\u0435\u043b\u0433\u0435\u0435\" is rarely played in these ceremonies, but in western Mongolia it is common for accompanying \"tatlaga dancing\" in 3 times - like a waltz, but with dance movements imitating daily tasks of a nomad's family.\n\nA number of folk metal and folk rock bands from Mongolia and the Chinese autonomous region of [[Inner Mongolia]] have combined heavy metal and rock music with traditional Mongolian lyrical themes and instruments, including the morin khuur; some of these bands include [[Nine Treasures]], [[Tengger Cavalry]], [[Hanggai (band)|Hanggai]], and [[the Hu]].\n\n==Gobi farmers animal psychology healing use==\nIn the Mongolian Gobi farmer's daily life the Morin Khuur has another important use. When a mother camel gives birth to a calf sometimes it rejects her calf due to various natural stress situations and Mongolian camel farmers use Morin Khuur-based melodies alongside special low harmonic types of songs called \"Khoosloh\" to heal mother camels' stress and encourage it to re-adopt its calf. This re-adoption of farm animal practice is widely used in various nomadic civilizations worldwide but for Mongolian Gobi farmers' cases, only this instrument is used on camels. In other cases if a mother camel dies after giving birth to a calf, a farmer would use this Khoosloh technique alongside Morin Khuur melodies to encourage another mother camel who has its own calf to adopt the new one. The practice is well documented on documentary called ''Ingen Egshig'' directed by Badraa J. in 1986<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accu.or.jp/ich/en/arts/A_MNG5.html|title=Asia-Pacific Database on Intangible Cultural Heritage(ICH)|website=www.accu.or.jp|accessdate=5 February 2019}}</ref> and was also remade in 2003 by director [[Byambasuren Davaa]] with a different title of ''[[The Story of the Weeping Camel]]'' which nominated for 2005 [[Academy Award]] for Best Documentary.<ref>[[77th Academy Awards]]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Music of Mongolia]]\n* [[List of Mongolian musical instruments]]\n* [[Topshur]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Marsh, Peter K.

The morin khuur is one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] identified by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]].\n\n== Name ==\nIn English usually called '''''morin khuur''''' (approx \"MORE-een HOOR\") or translated as \"horsehead fiddle\" (although the more literal translation would be just \"horse fiddle\" (or \"horse stringed-instrument\") --\"'Morin'\"=\"horse\", \"'khuur'\"=\"fiddle\"/\"stringed-instrument\").\n\nThe full [[Classical Mongolian]] name for the morin khuur is ''morin tolo\u03b3ai tai qu\u03b3ur'',  {{MongolUnicode|\u182e\u1823\u1837\u1822\u1828<br />\u1832\u1823\u182f\u1823\u182d\u1820\u1822 \u1832\u1820\u1822<br />\u182c\u1823\u182d\u1823\u1837}}, (which in modern [[Khalkh]] [[cyrillic]] is \u041c\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d \u0442\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0439\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0445\u0443\u0443\u0440) meaning ''fiddle with a horse's head''.

Accessed 23 April 2010.</ref>\n\n== Construction ==\nThe instrument consists of a [[trapezoid|trapeziform]] wooden-framed sound box to which two strings are attached.  It is held nearly upright with the sound box in the musician's lap or between the musician's legs. The strings are made from hairs from nylon or horses' tails,<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Morin khuur\n| url = http://www.silkroadproject.org/MusicArtists/Instruments/Morinkhuur/tabid/318/Default.aspx\n| publisher = www.silkroadproject.org\n| accessdate = 2010-04-24\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019144259/http://www.silkroadproject.org/MusicArtists/Instruments/Morinkhuur/tabid/318/Default.aspx\n| archive-date = 2013-10-19\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> strung parallel, and run over a wooden bridge on the body up a long neck, past a second smaller bridge, to the two tuning pegs in the scroll, which is usually carved into the form of a horse's head.\n[[File:Horsehair fiddles.jpg|alt=WOMADelaide festival Adelaide, Australia 2012|thumb|At WOMADelaide festival in [[Adelaide, Australia]] in 2012.]]\nThe bow is loosely strung with horse hair coated with [[larch]] or cedar wood resin, and is held from underneath with the right hand.  The underhand grip enables the hand to tighten the loose hair of the bow, allowing very fine control of the instrument's [[timbre]].\n\nThe larger of the two strings (the \"male\" string) has 130 hairs from a [[stallion (horse)|stallion]]'s tail, while the \"female\" string has 105 hairs from a [[mare (horse)|mare]]'s tail. Nowadays the strings are made of nylon. Traditionally, the strings were tuned a [[perfect fifth|fifth]] apart, though in modern music they are more often tuned a [[perfect fourth|fourth]] apart, usually to B-flat and F. The strings are stopped either by pinching them in the joints of the index and middle fingers, or by pinching them between the nail of the little finger and the pad of the ring finger.\n\nTraditionally, the frame is covered with [[camel]], [[goat]], or [[sheep]] skin, in which case a small opening would be left in the back. However, since the 1970s, new completely wooden sound box instruments have appeared, with carved [[f-hole]]s similar to European stringed instruments.<ref>CD booklet notes, ''Mongolia: Traditional Music'', 1991, Auvidis-UNESCO D 8207</ref>\n\nThe modern standard height is {{convert|1.15|m|abbr=on}}; the distance between the upper bridge and the lower bridge is about {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}}, but the upper bridge especially can be adapted to match smaller player's fingers. The sound box usually has a depth of {{convert|8|\u2013|9|cm|abbr=on}}; the width of the soundbox is about {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}} at the top and {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on}} at the bottom. Good quality instruments can achieve a strength of 85&nbsp;dBA, which allows it to be played (if desired) even in [[mezzo forte (musical notation)|mezzoforte]] or [[crescendo]]. When horsehair is used, the luthiers prefer to use the hair of white stallions. In general the quality of a horse hair string depends on its preparation, the climate conditions and the nutrition of the animals. That gives a wide area of quality differences.\n\nQuality nylon strings (Khalkh Mongolian: {{lang|mn|\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043d \u0445\u044f\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0441}}) last for up to 2 years, but only if prepared and placed properly on the instrument. Most beginners don't comb the strings, then the sound quality worsens quickly. Good strings nearly sound like steel strings, and in spectrograms they show about 7-8 harmonics.\n\nMorin khuur vary in form depending on region. Instruments from central [[Mongolia]] tend to have larger bodies and thus possess more volume than the smaller-bodied instruments of [[Inner Mongolia]]. Also the Inner Mongolian instruments have mostly mechanics for tightening the strings, where Mongolian luthiers mostly use wooden pegs in a slightly conic shape.  In [[Tuva]], the morin khuur is sometimes used in place of the [[igil]].\n\n== Origin ==\n{{Listen\n| pos         = left\n| filename    = Morin_khuur_sound.ogg\n| title       = \"Buyant Altai Khairkhan\" (Altai Khairkhan, 2000)\n| description = The sound of a morin khuur\n}}\n\n[[Image:Morin Khuur, South Mongolian Style.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Morin khuur, [[Inner Mongolia]]n style in China]]\n\nOne legend about the origin of the morin khuur is that a shepherd named Namjil the Cuckoo received the gift of a flying horse; he would mount it at night and fly to meet his beloved. A jealous woman had the horse\u2019s wings cut off, so that the horse fell from the air and died. The grieving shepherd made a horsehead fiddle from the now-wingless horse's skin and tail hair, and used it to play poignant songs about his horse.\n\nAnother legend credits the invention of the morin khuur to a boy named S\u00fckhe (or Suho). After a wicked lord slew the boy's prized white horse, the horse's spirit came to S\u00fckhe in a dream and instructed him to make an instrument from the horse's body, so the two could still be together and neither would be lonely. So the first morin khuur was assembled, with horse bones as its neck, horsehair strings, horse skin covering its wooden soundbox, and its scroll carved into the shape of a horse head.\n\nThe fact that most of the eastern [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] neighbors of the [[Mongols]] possess similar horse hair instruments (such as the [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] [[igil]], the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] [[kobyz]], or the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] [[Kyl kyyak]]), though not western [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], may point to a possible origin amongst peoples that once inhabited the [[Mongolian Steppe]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and migrated to what is now Tuva, [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].\n\nThe [[gusle]] from [[Southeastern Europe]] (Serbia, Croatia & Albania) is a very similar instrument, and may indicate this is an extremely ancient instrument perhaps even dating back to the outward migration of people out of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] some 40,000 years ago. Often these instruments are depicted with a goat head instead of a horse in Europe.\n\n== Playing technique ==\n[[File:Morin khuur in one of the Buryat villages in the Zakamensky district of Buryatia.jpg|thumb|Morin khuur in one of the Buryat villages in the Zakamensky district of Buryatia]]\n\nThe modern style Morin Khuur is played with nearly natural finger [[position (music)|positions]]. That means, the distance between two fingers usually make the distance of a [[semitone|half tone]] on the lower section of the instrument. On the tune F / B{{music|b}} the index finger hits on the low (F)  string the G, the middle finger hits the G{{music|#}}, the ring finger hits the A, the little finger the B flat. Identical positions are on the high strings - C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}. The little finger tips the B strings under the F string, while all other fingers touch the strings from the top.\n\nMelodies are usually played from F to F' on the F string, then the player switches to the B{{music|b}} string and continues with G, A, B{{music|b}}. There are 3 hand positions on the F string, and 2 positions on the B{{music|b}} strings a musician must memorize. The idea is that without moving the string hand too much the sound quality improves. The 2nd hand position on the B string is used to play C, D, E{{music|b}}, then moves a little bit for hitting the F' with the little finger, then without moving the G position can be reached with the 1st finger.\n\nIt is also possible to touch the B{{music|b}} string with the thumb to get a C, and use the ring finger under the F string to achieve the D{{music|#}}.\n\nOn the F strings only the first [[harmonic]] is used, so the scale ranges from F to F'. On the B{{music|b}} strings several harmonics are available: B{{music|b}}', F\", B\", also often players accompanying the F' on the F string with an F\" [[overtone]] at the F' position on the B{{music|b}} string.\n\nSome parts of the bowing technique is unique - the little and the ring finger of the right hand usually touch the bow hair, which is used for setting accents. The other two fingers maintain a slight pressure on the strings. A common technique with other string instruments is the \"Kist\". When the bow direction changes, the right hand moves a little bit in advance to the opposite direction to avoid scratchy sounds and for achieving a better voice. When pushing the bow the hand closes a little bit in direction of a fist, when pulling it the hand opens - nearly to a right angle between the arm and the fingers.\n\nThe instrument can be used for playing western style classical music, or Mongolian style pieces. The primary education is to learn the scales, to train the ear for achieving the \"[[muscle memory]]\", the ability to automatically adapt the finger position when a note wasn't hit properly. The main goal is to achieve a \"clear\" sound, that means no change in volume or frequency is desired. That depends on three main facts:\n\n- finger force used for touching the strings\n- pressure of the bow\n- constant sound after bow direction changes\n\nAs variation are usually used the \"[[accent (music)|accent]]\" and the \"[[vibrato]]\". Other techniques like the \"[[Col legno]]\", the \"[[Pizzicato]]\" or the \"[[Martellato]]\" are generally not used on the Morin Huur.\n\nBecause of its standard tune to Bb and F mostly western music is transposed for being played in one of the four most common scales: F major, F minor, B{{music|b}} Major, E{{music|b}} major. When used as a solo instrument the Morin Huur is often tuned a half tone higher or lower.\n\nNearly all of the Mongolian style pieces are in F minor, and often the instrument is tuned 1-2 notes lower for coming closer to the tunes used in the deep past. The instruments in the pre-socialist era of Mongolia were usually covered with skin, which mostly doesn't allow the Bb and F tune - usually tuned 2-4 notes deeper.\n\nOn the contemporary Morin Khuur the deep string is placed at the right side and the high string is placed at the left side, seen from the front of the instrument. The Igil has the opposite placement of strings, so a player has to adapt in order to play pieces made for the other one. For contemporary teaching the modern style is in use.\n\n== Education ==\n\nIn Mongolia the morin khuur can be learned at three schools:\n* The SUIS ({{lang|mn|\u0441\u043e\u0451\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0443\u0440\u043b\u0430\u0433\u044b\u043d \u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0443\u043b\u044c}}), engl. \"university of arts and culture\". Here students enter in adult age for obtaining a bachelor's degree after 2 years and a master's degree after 5 years of musical education. After the master's degree the students are considered to be professional musicians, and can play at one of the state ensembles or later become a teacher at the SUIS.\n* Mongolian State Conservatory ({{lang|mn|\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b \u0423\u043b\u0441\u044b\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438}}). Accepting students who are not older than 10 years old for the morin khuur class at the conservatory and since September 2017, the conservatory has been offering Bachelor of Music and Master of Music in Morin Khuur Performance degree.\n* The culture school of the SUIS ({{lang|mn|\u0421\u0423\u0418\u0421\u044b, \u0441\u043e\u0451\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0441\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0443\u043b\u044c}}). Here several qualification courses are available. Graduates from this school mostly become teachers or enter the SUIS.\n\nAlso many amateur players acquired reasonable skills by taking lessons from private teachers, or being taught by their parents or other relatives.\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n\nThe morin khuur is the national instrument in Mongolia. Many festivals are held for celebrating the importance of this instrument on the Mongolian culture, like the biannual \"International Morin Huur Festival and competition\", which is organized by the \"World Morinhuur Association\". First held in 2008, second in 2010 - with 8 participating countries (Mongolia, Korea, China, Russia, USA, Germany, France, Japan) - and planned for May 2012. Here many amateurs come and play freestyle pieces, but also a professional contest is held and an instrument making competition.\n\nDuring June the \"roaring hooves\" festival is held. This is a small festival for professional skilled players - but unfortunately a closed festival. These recordings are often shown in TV reports later.\n\nOn the national festival \"Naadam\" praise songs are played for the most magnificent horse and for the highest ranked wrestler and archer. The songs are called \"Magtaal\" and accompanied by a unique style of praise and morin khuur.\n\nMany Mongolians have the instrument in their home because it is a symbol for peace and happiness.\n\nDuring the winter time, but also in beginning of the spring time a morin khuur player is called in for the \"\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440 \u04af\u0440\u0433\u044d\u044d\u0445\", the \"ceremony for scaring away the frost\". In general many traditional pieces are played, divided in the different styles: \"\u0443\u0440\u0442\u044b\u043d \u0434\u0443\u0443\", \"urtiin duu\" (long song), \"\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0442\u0430\u0430\u043b\", \"magtaal\" (praise songs) and \"\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\", \"tatlaga\" (solo pieces, mostly imitiating horses or camels).\n\nThe fourth style, the \"\u0431\u0438\u0435\u043b\u0433\u0435\u0435\" is rarely played in these ceremonies, but in western Mongolia it is common for accompanying \"tatlaga dancing\" in 3 times - like a waltz, but with dance movements imitating daily tasks of a nomad's family.\n\nA number of folk metal and folk rock bands from Mongolia and the Chinese autonomous region of [[Inner Mongolia]] have combined heavy metal and rock music with traditional Mongolian lyrical themes and instruments, including the morin khuur; some of these bands include [[Nine Treasures]], [[Tengger Cavalry]], [[Hanggai (band)|Hanggai]], and [[the Hu]].\n\n==Gobi farmers animal psychology healing use==\nIn the Mongolian Gobi farmer's daily life the Morin Khuur has another important use. When a mother camel gives birth to a calf sometimes it rejects her calf due to various natural stress situations and Mongolian camel farmers use Morin Khuur-based melodies alongside special low harmonic types of songs called \"Khoosloh\" to heal mother camels' stress and encourage it to re-adopt its calf. This re-adoption of farm animal practice is widely used in various nomadic civilizations worldwide but for Mongolian Gobi farmers' cases, only this instrument is used on camels. In other cases if a mother camel dies after giving birth to a calf, a farmer would use this Khoosloh technique alongside Morin Khuur melodies to encourage another mother camel who has its own calf to adopt the new one. The practice is well documented on documentary called ''Ingen Egshig'' directed by Badraa J. in 1986<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accu.or.jp/ich/en/arts/A_MNG5.html|title=Asia-Pacific Database on Intangible Cultural Heritage(ICH)|website=www.accu.or.jp|accessdate=5 February 2019}}</ref> and was also remade in 2003 by director [[Byambasuren Davaa]] with a different title of ''[[The Story of the Weeping Camel]]'' which nominated for 2005 [[Academy Award]] for Best Documentary.<ref>[[77th Academy Awards]]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Music of Mongolia]]\n* [[List of Mongolian musical instruments]]\n* [[Topshur]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Marsh, Peter K.

As a result, numerous small seeds and fruit seeds were recovered.  Of the fruits, [[pin cherry]], [[pokeberry]], [[grape]] and [[blackberry]]/[[raspberry]] were present.  Of the seeds, several indigenous starchy and oily seed were recovered, including [[goosefoot]], [[maygrass]], [[knotweed]], [[amaranth]], [[sumpweed]], and [[sunflower].  These seeds are part of the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]], a group of cultivated or semi-cultivated plants utilized by the Prehistoric populations in addition to the better-known crops such as [[maize]], [[Bean|beans]] and [[Cucurbita|squash]].

The authors of the site report hypothesize that Berrien-Huber ware may be associated with the historic [[Miami tribe|Miami]] tribe; the Moccasin Bluff Scalloped with an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribe such as the [[Potawatomi]]; and the Moccasin Bluff Notched Applique Strip with [[Ohio]] tribes who may have been displaced during the [[Iroquois Wars]].<ref name=\"Bettarel\"/> Based on the fact that [[Michigan]] was traditionally considered the homeland of the [[Potawatomi]], other researchers have also suggested that the Berrien Phase represents the material culture of the [[Potawatomi]] tribe.<ref name=\"Cremin\">{{cite book |last1=Cremin |first1=William M. |editor1-last=Holman |editor1-first=Margaret B., Janet G.

Therefore the site was abandoned at or just before the time of [[Europe|European]] contact.<ref name=\"Bettarel\"/> The same may be said for the Berrien Phase component at the nearby [[Schwerdt Site|Schwerdt]] site.<ref name=\"McAllister\"/> The reason for this may be that in the [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] or early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period the [[Potawatomi]] were displaced from western Michigan as a result of the [[Iroquois Wars]] and moved to the west shore of [[Lake Michigan]] into [[Wisconsin]].<ref name=\"Cremin\"/>  The [[Rock Island II Site]] on [[Rock Island, Wisconsin|Rock Island]] in [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]], northern [[Lake Michigan]] in [[Wisconsin]] is a good example of a [[Potawatomi]] village in this early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.<ref name=\"Mason2\"/> As a result, the lower peninsula of Michigan became a \"no-mans land\", mostly unoccupied for several decades.<ref name=\"Cremin\"/>\n\n== Results of 2002 Excavations ==\n\nFurther excavations were conducted in 2002 to further clarify questions about the [[Subsistence economy|subsistence]] patterns and site function.<ref name=\"myth\">{{cite journal |last1=O'Gorman |first1=Jodie |title=The Myth of Moccasin Bluff: Rethinking the Potawatomi Pattern |journal=Ethnohistory |date=2007 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=373-406}}</ref><ref name=\"O'Gorman\">{{cite journal |last1=O'Gorman |first1=Jodie |title=Revisiting the Moccasin Bluff Site |journal=Michigan Archaeologist |date=2003 |volume=49 |issue=1-2 |pages=7-38}}</ref>  Further examples of Moccasin Bluff Ware were recovered; Moccasin Bluff Plain Modified Lip, Moccasin Bluff Impressed Exterior Lip, Moccasin Bluff Scalloped, Moccasin Bluff [[Cord-marked pottery|Cordmarked]], and Moccasin Bluff Plain.<ref name=\"O'Gorman\"/>  In addition, there were vessels recovered from the [[Middle Woodland]] and also a partially reconstructed vessel from the [[Early Woodland Period|Early Woodland]], a poorly represented time period in the 1948 excavations.<ref name=\"O'Gorman\"/>\n\nThe 2002 excavations used the [[Flotation (archaeology)|flotation]] technique to recover small plant remains, a practice that was not used in earlier times.  As a result, numerous small seeds and fruit seeds were recovered.  Of the fruits, [[pin cherry]], [[pokeberry]], [[grape]] and [[blackberry]]/[[raspberry]] were present.  Of the seeds, several indigenous starchy and oily seed were recovered, including [[goosefoot]], [[maygrass]], [[knotweed]], [[amaranth]], [[sumpweed]], and [[sunflower].  These seeds are part of the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]], a group of cultivated or semi-cultivated plants utilized by the Prehistoric populations in addition to the better-known crops such as [[maize]], [[Bean|beans]] and [[Cucurbita|squash]]. These types of small seeds are not likely to be recovered unless [[Flotation (archaeology)|flotation]] is used, which is why they were underreported and largely unknown until [[Flotation (archaeology)|flotation]] [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] became widespread among [[Archaeology|archaeologists]].<ref name=\"O'Gorman\"/>\n\n== Site function and Berrien Phase settlement patterns ==\n\nThe data recovered from the Moccasin Bluff site shows many indications that the site was occupied for most or all of the year:\n\n* Maize was present at the site, implying it was planted in the spring and harvested in the fall; the presence of numerous deer mandibles implies processing of maize at the site\n* The sturgeon spawning run is in the spring, indicating spring occupation\n* Nutshell was present, indicating a fall occupation\n* Deer may be taken at any time of the year, but in the fall they are at their maximum weight and have grown thicker coats.  The early Historic Native American tribes were observed to have an annual fall deer hunt in which the deer were \"driven\" and killed in mass.\n* Numerous storage pits were present, implying food was stored over the winter\n\nBased on evidence from the excavations, combined with evidence from the early Historic Native American tribes, it was concluded that the Moccasin Bluff site represented a permanent or semi-permanent site, with other sites such as Schwerdt serving as temporary encampments to exploit seasonal resources.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fitting |first1=James E. and Charles E.

Since there is a lack of known [[Late Woodland]] or [[Upper Mississippian culture|Upper Mississippian]] [[protohistoric]] village sites elsewhere in western [[Michigan]], some researchers are suggesting that perhaps the resources available in the area simply did not support large villages and thus, small occupations and encampments were the norm until [[Europe|European]] contact times.<ref name=\"O'Gorman\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | author1 = Robert Louis Bettarel | author2 = Hale Gilliam Smith | title = The Moccasin Bluff site and the Woodland cultures of southwestern Michigan | year =1973}}\n*{{citation | author = Jodie A.
