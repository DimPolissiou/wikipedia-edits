HOWARD'''<br />\nUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\n</center>\nfor service as set forth in the following CITATION:\n\n:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a Platoon Leader, Company \"C\", First Reconnaissance Battalion, First Marine Division (Reinforced), [[Fleet Marine Force, Pacific]], in action against communist insurgent forces in [[Quang Tin Province]], Republic of Vietnam, on 16 June 1966. During the night Gunnery Sergeant (then Staff Sergeant) Howard's platoon of eighteen men was assaulted by a numerically superior force consisting of a well-trained North Vietnamese Battalion employing heavy [[small arms]] fire, [[automatic weapon]]s and accurate [[mortar (weapon)|weapon]] fire. Without hesitation he immediately organized his platoon to personally supervise the precarious defense of Hill 488. Utterly oblivious to the unrelenting fury of hostile enemy weapons fire and [[hand grenade]]s he repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire while directing the operation of his small force. As the enemy attack progressed and the enemy fire increased in volume and accuracy and despite his mounting casualties, Gunnery Sergeant Howard continued to set an example of calmness and courage. Moving from position to position, he inspired his men with dynamic leadership and courageous fighting spirit until he was struck and painfully wounded by fragments from an enemy hand grenade. Unable to move his legs and realizing that the position was becoming untenable, he distributed his ammunition to the remaining members of his platoon and skillfully directed friendly aircraft and [[artillery]] strikes with uncanny accuracy upon the enemy. Dawn found the beleaguered force diminished by five killed and all but one wounded. When rescue helicopters proceeded to Gunnery Sergeant Howard's position, he directed them away from his badly mauled force and called additional [[air strike]]s and directed devastating small arms fire on the enemy thus making the landing zone secure as possible. His valiant leadership and courageous fighting spirit served to inspire the men of his platoon to heroic endeavor in the face of overwhelming odds, and reflected the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant Howard, the Marine Corps and the [[United States Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]].\n\n/S/ LYNDON B. JOHNSON\n\n===Silver Star citation===\n'''Citation:'''\n\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Corporal Jimmie Earl Howard (MCSN: 1130610), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while attached to the 4.2\" Mortar Company, First Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), and serving as a Forward Observer of a rifle company in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea from 12 to 15 August 1952. During the defense of an important hill position, Corporal Howard called in and directed effective fire for friendly mortar and artillery positions, materially strengthening the defense of the position. Although occupied with the duties of forward observer, he participated in deadly hand to hand combat with the enemy to maintain his forward observation post and, although subsequently relieved for rest, sided in evacuating the wounded and in carrying vitally needed supplies to his comrades. Later, although knocked unconscious by the concussion from an enemy mortar shell, he recovered sufficiently to continue to perform his duties and, after being felled again by another mortar shell was evacuated on account of the severity of his condition. By his outstanding courage, initiative and unyielding devotion to duty, Corporal Howard served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://valor.militarytimes.com/hero/1680#92650 |title=Jimmie Earl Howard |work=[[Military Times]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n== Namesake ==\n[[File:USS Howard DDG-83.jpg|150px|thumb|left|{{USS|Howard|DDG-83|6}}]]\nThe {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|0}} guide missile destroyer {{USS|Howard|DDG-83|6}}, named in honor of Jimmie E.

HOWARD'''<br />\nUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\n</center>\nfor service as set forth in the following CITATION:\n\n:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a Platoon Leader, Company \"C\", First Reconnaissance Battalion, First Marine Division (Reinforced), [[Fleet Marine Force, Pacific]], in action against communist insurgent forces in [[Quang Tin Province]], Republic of Vietnam, on 16 June 1966. During the night Gunnery Sergeant (then Staff Sergeant) Howard's platoon of eighteen men was assaulted by a numerically superior force consisting of a well-trained North Vietnamese Battalion employing heavy [[small arms]] fire, [[automatic weapon]]s and accurate [[mortar (weapon)|weapon]] fire. Without hesitation he immediately organized his platoon to personally supervise the precarious defense of Hill 488. Utterly oblivious to the unrelenting fury of hostile enemy weapons fire and [[hand grenade]]s he repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire while directing the operation of his small force. As the enemy attack progressed and the enemy fire increased in volume and accuracy and despite his mounting casualties, Gunnery Sergeant Howard continued to set an example of calmness and courage. Moving from position to position, he inspired his men with dynamic leadership and courageous fighting spirit until he was struck and painfully wounded by fragments from an enemy hand grenade. Unable to move his legs and realizing that the position was becoming untenable, he distributed his ammunition to the remaining members of his platoon and skillfully directed friendly aircraft and [[artillery]] strikes with uncanny accuracy upon the enemy. Dawn found the beleaguered force diminished by five killed and all but one wounded. When rescue helicopters proceeded to Gunnery Sergeant Howard's position, he directed them away from his badly mauled force and called additional [[air strike]]s and directed devastating small arms fire on the enemy thus making the landing zone secure as possible. His valiant leadership and courageous fighting spirit served to inspire the men of his platoon to heroic endeavor in the face of overwhelming odds, and reflected the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant Howard, the Marine Corps and the [[United States Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]].\n\n/S/ LYNDON B. JOHNSON\n\n===Silver Star citation===\n'''Citation:'''\n\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Corporal Jimmie Earl Howard (MCSN: 1130610), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while attached to the 4.2\" Mortar Company, First Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), and serving as a Forward Observer of a rifle company in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea from 12 to 15 August 1952. During the defense of an important hill position, Corporal Howard called in and directed effective fire for friendly mortar and artillery positions, materially strengthening the defense of the position. Although occupied with the duties of forward observer, he participated in deadly hand to hand combat with the enemy to maintain his forward observation post and, although subsequently relieved for rest, sided in evacuating the wounded and in carrying vitally needed supplies to his comrades. Later, although knocked unconscious by the concussion from an enemy mortar shell, he recovered sufficiently to continue to perform his duties and, after being felled again by another mortar shell was evacuated on account of the severity of his condition. By his outstanding courage, initiative and unyielding devotion to duty, Corporal Howard served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://valor.militarytimes.com/hero/1680#92650 |title=Jimmie Earl Howard |work=[[Military Times]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n== Namesake ==\n[[File:USS Howard DDG-83.jpg|150px|thumb|left|{{USS|Howard|DDG-83|6}}]]\nThe {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|0}} guide missile destroyer {{USS|Howard|DDG-83|6}}, named in honor of Jimmie E.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\nOn 16 October 1958, returning to Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\">{{Cite web|title = All A-3 Skywarriors Produced by Douglas|url =https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html|website = www.a3skywarrior.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nTwo days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />. All sixteen aircrew were killed.\n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportuni\u00adties for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. \n\nBetween 1966 and 1968, the squadron suffered three Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">{{Cite web|title =Accident Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior 142670, 04 Jun 1968|url =https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670|website = aviation-safety.net|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>\n# In the summer of 1968, a rocket attack on Danang damaged the nose and cockpit of EA-3B (BUNO 144848)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />.

In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\nIn the same period, VQ-2 had two partial crew bail outs:\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 142257)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam.

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\nOn 16 October 1958, returning to Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\">{{Cite web|title = All A-3 Skywarriors Produced by Douglas|url =https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html|website = www.a3skywarrior.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nTwo days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />. All sixteen aircrew were killed.\n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

The flight crew declared an emergency and diverted to [[Munich-Riem Airport]]. To observers on the ground, WV-2Q seemed explode with the tail separating from the main fuselage over [[Markt Schwaben]], 17 km south of Munich Airport. The main fuselage and tail section crashed several hundred yards apart in fields southwest of the town. The aircraft was totally destroyed killing all twenty-two Navy and four Army aircrew.

The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportuni\u00adties for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. \n\nBetween 1966 and 1968, the squadron suffered three Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">{{Cite web|title =Accident Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior 142670, 04 Jun 1968|url =https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670|website = aviation-safety.net|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>\n# In the summer of 1968, a rocket attack on Danang damaged the nose and cockpit of EA-3B (BUNO 144848)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />.

In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\nIn the same period, VQ-2 had two partial crew bail outs:\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 142257)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# Returning from a mission along the East German/Czech border in the during the \"[[Prague Spring]]\" of 1968, an EA-3B was entering the landing pattern at Ramstein AFB when it had a slat malfunction pitching nose-up turn.<ref name=\"East\" />.

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

[[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]] are the current Russian Premier League champions.\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], starting in 1992, each former Soviet republic organized an independent national championship. In Russia, the six Russian teams who had played in the [[Soviet Top League]] in 1991 ([[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]], [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]], [[FC Spartak Vladikavkaz|Spartak Vladikavkaz]], and [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]]) were supplemented with 14 teams from lower divisions to form a 20-team Russian Top Division. The Top Division was further divided into two groups to reduce the total number of matches. The number of teams in the Top Division was gradually reduced to 18 in 1993 and 16 in 1994. Since then, the Russian Top Division (and subsequently the Premier League) has consisted of 16 teams, except for a short-lived experiment with having two more teams in 1996 and 1997.\n\nSpartak Moscow was the dominant force in the top division, winning nine of the first ten titles. [[FC Spartak Vladikavkaz|Spartak-Alania Vladikavkaz]] was the only team which managed to break Spartak's dominance, winning the top division title in 1995. Lokomotiv Moscow have won the title three times, and CSKA Moscow six times.\n\nIn 2007, [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit St. Petersburg]] climbed to the top, winning the title for the first time in their history in Russian professional football; they had also won a Soviet title in 1984. 2008 brought the rise of [[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin Kazan]], a club entirely new to the Russian top flight, as it had never competed in the Soviet Top League.\n\nIn mid-2010s, some [[stadiums]] opened. CSKA Moscow got a new [[stadium]] named [[Arena CSKA]], later named VEB Arena. It holds a capacity of 30,000. [[FC Krasnodar]] got the most modern stadium in Europe named [[Krasnodar Stadium]]. It holds a capacity of 34,000.\n\nIn preparation for the 2018\u201319 season, it was decided to hold a rebranding in which a new logo was presented, and the league was renamed the '''Russian Premier League''' (RPL).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://matchtv.ru/football/rfpl/matchtvnews_NI843132_Futbol_i_sombrero_oni_esli_chestno_ |title=\u0424\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0440\u043e, \u043e\u043d\u0438, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e... \u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u044b \u0420\u0424\u041f\u041b \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u0443\u043a\u0438 |access-date=17 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418032357/https://matchtv.ru/football/rfpl/matchtvnews_NI843132_Futbol_i_sombrero_oni_esli_chestno_ |archive-date=18 April 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sport-express.ru/football/rfpl/reviews/novyy-logotip-premer-ligi-prosto-bomba-1395907/ |title=\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0440-\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0430! |date=12 April 2018 |accessdate=12 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629064525/http://www.sport-express.ru/football/rfpl/reviews/novyy-logotip-premer-ligi-prosto-bomba-1395907/ |archive-date=29 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportsdaily.ru/articles/medvezhya-usluga-s-chem-assocziiruetsya-nash-futbol |title=\u041c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u0435 \u0420\u0424\u041f\u041b. |accessdate=12 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618075616/https://www.sportsdaily.ru/articles/medvezhya-usluga-s-chem-assocziiruetsya-nash-futbol |archive-date=18 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://matchtv.ru/football/matchtvnews_NI843462_Predstavlen_rabochij_variant_novogo_logotipa_RFPL |title=\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u0430 \u0420\u0424\u041f\u041b |accessdate=12 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618203624/https://matchtv.ru/football/matchtvnews_NI843462_Predstavlen_rabochij_variant_novogo_logotipa_RFPL |archive-date=18 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.artlebedev.ru/rpl/logo/process/ |title=C\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0440-\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438 |website=www.artlebedev.ru |accessdate=12 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714193056/https://www.artlebedev.ru/rpl/logo/process/ |archive-date=14 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Competition==\n[[Image:Kirov stadium.jpg|thumb|250px|Russian Premier League match between [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit]] and [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo]] (the last Zenit match at the [[Kirov Stadium]], stadium had been already partially demolished.)]]\n\nTeams in the Russian Premier League play each other twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 30 matches. Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. If teams are level on points, the tie-breakers are the number of wins, then the goal difference, followed by several other factors. If the teams are tied for the first position, the tie-breakers are the number of wins, then head-to-head results. If the teams tied for the first place cannot be separated by these tie-breakers, a championship play-off is ordered.\n\n[[Image:Lokomotiv Stadium 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Russian Premier League match between [[Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv]] and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak]] at the [[Lokomotiv Stadium (Moscow)|Lokomotiv Stadium]]]]\n\nAs of 2010, the champions and the runners-up qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage. The third-placed team qualifies for the Champions League Third qualifying round. The fourth- and fifth-place teams qualify for the [[UEFA Europa League]]. The bottom two teams are relegated to the [[Russian Football National League|First Division]] (renamed the National Football League starting in 2011).\n\nUnlike most other European football leagues, the league traditionally ran in summer, from March to November, to avoid playing games in the cold and snowy weather in winter. This was altered ahead of the 2012\u201313 season, with the league planning to run the season from autumn to spring. The transitional season of the competition began in early 2011 and continued until summer of 2012. After the 16 Premier League teams played each other twice over the course of the 2011 calendar year, they were split into two groups of eight, and the teams played other teams in their groups two more times for a total of 44 games (30 in 2011 and 14 in 2012). Those two groups were contested in spring 2012, with the top eight clubs playing for the title and European places. The other sides vied to avoid relegation: the bottom two went down while the next two played off against the sides third and fourth in the National Football League, with the two losers being relegated (or denied promotion).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=rus/news/newsid=1527870.html?cid=PULSE_TW |title=Russian league switches to new calendar |work=UEFA.com |publisher=[[UEFA]] |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2010-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217045135/http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=rus/news/newsid=1527870.html?cid=PULSE_TW |archive-date=17 February 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Under the current autumn-spring calendar, the league takes a three-month winter break from mid-December until mid-March.\n\n==Youth championship==\nThe '''[[:ru:\u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0451\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0443|Youth championship]]''' ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e}}), also known as '''Youth teams championship''' ({{lang-ru|\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0451\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434}}), '''Reserve team tournament''' ({{lang-ru|\u0422\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0440 \u0434\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432}}) or '''[[:ru:\u0422\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0440 \u0434\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0451\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0420\u0424\u041f\u041b|Reserves tournament]]''' ({{lang-ru|\u0422\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0440 \u0434\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0451\u0440\u043e\u0432}}), full name '''Youth football championship of Russia among teams of clubs of the Premier League''' ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0451\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0443 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434 \u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0432 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0440-\u041b\u0438\u0433\u0438}}), is a league that runs in parallel to the Russian Premier League and includes the youth or [[reserve team]]s of the Russian Premier League teams. The number of players a team can have on the pitch at a time that are over 21 years of age or without a Russian citizenship is limited. 16 teams participate in the league. Matches are commonly played a day before the match of the senior teams of the respective teams. All of the Russian Premier League teams are obliged to have a youth team that would participate in the Youth championship. The teams that are promoted from the National Football League and do not have a youth team must create one. The teams in the league are not relegated based on their final league position, but on the league position of their respective clubs' senior teams.\n\nIt has to be noted however that some Premier League clubs have three teams. Apart from the senior team and the team that plays in the Youth championship a team might have another senior team that plays in a lower division of Russian football and serves as the [[farm team]] for the main team.

[[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]] are the current Russian Premier League champions.\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], starting in 1992, each former Soviet republic organized an independent national championship. In Russia, the six Russian teams who had played in the [[Soviet Top League]] in 1991 ([[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]], [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]], [[FC Spartak Vladikavkaz|Spartak Vladikavkaz]], and [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]]) were supplemented with 14 teams from lower divisions to form a 20-team Russian Top Division. The Top Division was further divided into two groups to reduce the total number of matches. The number of teams in the Top Division was gradually reduced to 18 in 1993 and 16 in 1994. Since then, the Russian Top Division (and subsequently the Premier League) has consisted of 16 teams, except for a short-lived experiment with having two more teams in 1996 and 1997.\n\nSpartak Moscow was the dominant force in the top division, winning nine of the first ten titles. [[FC Spartak Vladikavkaz|Spartak-Alania Vladikavkaz]] was the only team which managed to break Spartak's dominance, winning the top division title in 1995. Lokomotiv Moscow have won the title three times, and CSKA Moscow six times.\n\nIn 2007, [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit St. Petersburg]] climbed to the top, winning the title for the first time in their history in Russian professional football; they had also won a Soviet title in 1984. 2008 brought the rise of [[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin Kazan]], a club entirely new to the Russian top flight, as it had never competed in the Soviet Top League.\n\nIn mid-2010s, some [[stadiums]] opened. CSKA Moscow got a new [[stadium]] named [[Arena CSKA]], later named VEB Arena. It holds a capacity of 30,000. [[FC Krasnodar]] got the most modern stadium in Europe named [[Krasnodar Stadium]]. It holds a capacity of 34,000.\n\nIn preparation for the 2018\u201319 season, it was decided to hold a rebranding in which a new logo was presented, and the league was renamed the '''Russian Premier League''' (RPL).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://matchtv.ru/football/rfpl/matchtvnews_NI843132_Futbol_i_sombrero_oni_esli_chestno_ |title=\u0424\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0440\u043e, \u043e\u043d\u0438, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e... \u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u044b \u0420\u0424\u041f\u041b \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u0443\u043a\u0438 |access-date=17 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418032357/https://matchtv.ru/football/rfpl/matchtvnews_NI843132_Futbol_i_sombrero_oni_esli_chestno_ |archive-date=18 April 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sport-express.ru/football/rfpl/reviews/novyy-logotip-premer-ligi-prosto-bomba-1395907/ |title=\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0440-\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0430! |date=12 April 2018 |accessdate=12 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629064525/http://www.sport-express.ru/football/rfpl/reviews/novyy-logotip-premer-ligi-prosto-bomba-1395907/ |archive-date=29 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportsdaily.ru/articles/medvezhya-usluga-s-chem-assocziiruetsya-nash-futbol |title=\u041c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u0435 \u0420\u0424\u041f\u041b. |accessdate=12 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618075616/https://www.sportsdaily.ru/articles/medvezhya-usluga-s-chem-assocziiruetsya-nash-futbol |archive-date=18 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://matchtv.ru/football/matchtvnews_NI843462_Predstavlen_rabochij_variant_novogo_logotipa_RFPL |title=\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u0430 \u0420\u0424\u041f\u041b |accessdate=12 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618203624/https://matchtv.ru/football/matchtvnews_NI843462_Predstavlen_rabochij_variant_novogo_logotipa_RFPL |archive-date=18 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.artlebedev.ru/rpl/logo/process/ |title=C\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0440-\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438 |website=www.artlebedev.ru |accessdate=12 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714193056/https://www.artlebedev.ru/rpl/logo/process/ |archive-date=14 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Competition==\n[[Image:Kirov stadium.jpg|thumb|250px|Russian Premier League match between [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit]] and [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo]] (the last Zenit match at the [[Kirov Stadium]], stadium had been already partially demolished.)]]\n\nTeams in the Russian Premier League play each other twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 30 matches. Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. If teams are level on points, the tie-breakers are the number of wins, then the goal difference, followed by several other factors. If the teams are tied for the first position, the tie-breakers are the number of wins, then head-to-head results. If the teams tied for the first place cannot be separated by these tie-breakers, a championship play-off is ordered.\n\n[[Image:Lokomotiv Stadium 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Russian Premier League match between [[Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv]] and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak]] at the [[Lokomotiv Stadium (Moscow)|Lokomotiv Stadium]]]]\n\nAs of 2010, the champions and the runners-up qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage. The third-placed team qualifies for the Champions League Third qualifying round. The fourth- and fifth-place teams qualify for the [[UEFA Europa League]]. The bottom two teams are relegated to the [[Russian Football National League|First Division]] (renamed the National Football League starting in 2011).\n\nUnlike most other European football leagues, the league traditionally ran in summer, from March to November, to avoid playing games in the cold and snowy weather in winter. This was altered ahead of the 2012\u201313 season, with the league planning to run the season from autumn to spring. The transitional season of the competition began in early 2011 and continued until summer of 2012. After the 16 Premier League teams played each other twice over the course of the 2011 calendar year, they were split into two groups of eight, and the teams played other teams in their groups two more times for a total of 44 games (30 in 2011 and 14 in 2012). Those two groups were contested in spring 2012, with the top eight clubs playing for the title and European places. The other sides vied to avoid relegation: the bottom two went down while the next two played off against the sides third and fourth in the National Football League, with the two losers being relegated (or denied promotion).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=rus/news/newsid=1527870.html?cid=PULSE_TW |title=Russian league switches to new calendar |work=UEFA.com |publisher=[[UEFA]] |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2010-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217045135/http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=rus/news/newsid=1527870.html?cid=PULSE_TW |archive-date=17 February 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Under the current autumn-spring calendar, the league takes a three-month winter break from mid-December until mid-March.\n\n==Youth championship==\nThe '''[[:ru:\u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0451\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0443|Youth championship]]''' ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e}}), also known as '''Youth teams championship''' ({{lang-ru|\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0451\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434}}), '''Reserve team tournament''' ({{lang-ru|\u0422\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0440 \u0434\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432}}) or '''[[:ru:\u0422\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0440 \u0434\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0451\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0420\u0424\u041f\u041b|Reserves tournament]]''' ({{lang-ru|\u0422\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0440 \u0434\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0451\u0440\u043e\u0432}}), full name '''Youth football championship of Russia among teams of clubs of the Premier League''' ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0451\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0443 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434 \u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0432 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0440-\u041b\u0438\u0433\u0438}}), is a league that runs in parallel to the Russian Premier League and includes the youth or [[reserve team]]s of the Russian Premier League teams. The number of players a team can have on the pitch at a time that are over 21 years of age or without a Russian citizenship is limited. 16 teams participate in the league. Matches are commonly played a day before the match of the senior teams of the respective teams. All of the Russian Premier League teams are obliged to have a youth team that would participate in the Youth championship. The teams that are promoted from the National Football League and do not have a youth team must create one. The teams in the league are not relegated based on their final league position, but on the league position of their respective clubs' senior teams.\n\nIt has to be noted however that some Premier League clubs have three teams. Apart from the senior team and the team that plays in the Youth championship a team might have another senior team that plays in a lower division of Russian football and serves as the [[farm team]] for the main team. Some examples include [[FC Spartak-2 Moscow|Spartak-2]] and [[FC Zenit-2 Saint Petersburg|Zenit-2]], playing in the [[Russian Football National League]].\n\n====[[:ru:\u0422\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0440 \u0434\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0451\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0420\u0424\u041f\u041b|Reserves tournament]] champions (2001-2007)====\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*2001: [[FC Rotor Volgograd|Rotor Volgograd]]\n*2002: [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]\n*2003: [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]\n*2004: [[FC Terek Grozny|Terek Grozny]]\n*2005: [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]]\n*2006: [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]\n*2007: [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]\n====[[:ru:\u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0451\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0443|Youth championship]] winners (since 2008)====\n*2008: [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]\n*2009: [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]]\n*2010: [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]\n*2011: [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]]\n*2012: [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]\n*2012\u201313: [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]\n*2013\u201314: [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]\n*2014\u201315: [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]\n*2015\u201316: [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]]\n*2016\u201317: [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]\n*2017\u201318: [[FC Krasnodar|Krasnodar]]\n*2018\u201319: [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== UEFA club rankings ==\n[[Russia]] are currently sixth in the [[UEFA]] coefficient rankings.
