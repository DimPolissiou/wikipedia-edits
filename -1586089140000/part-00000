DSU is one of eight publicly funded universities in the state.\n\n==History==\nThe school was established in 1924 by the State of Mississippi, using the facilities of the former Bolivar County Agricultural High School, which consisted of three buildings in Cleveland. On February 19, 1924, Senators William B. Roberts and Arthur Marshall cosponsored Senate Bill No. 236, which established Delta State Teachers College, which Mississippi Governor [[Henry L. Whitfield]] signed on April 9, 1924;<ref>{{harvp|Gunn|Castle|1980|p=11}}</ref> the bill had been sponsored in the [[Mississippi House of Representatives]] by [[Nellie Nugent Somerville]], the first woman to serve in the Mississippi state legislature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/legislators/Mississippi.html|title=Women Wielding Power-Mississippi|work=nwhm.org|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> The three buildings were Hill Hall, an administration and classroom building, Hardee Hall, a men's dormitory, and Taylor Hall, a women's dormitory.\n\nOn February 14, 1924, James Wesley Broom was appointed president of the college, and the college opened its doors on September 15, 1925. In May 1926, Broom died following complications from an ear infection. William Zeigel was named his successor. The seal of the college was designed in 1928 as a project of an art class.<ref>{{harvp|Gunn|Castle|1980|p=40}}</ref>\n\nWorld War II greatly affected the college. Anticipating the war in 1941, the college created a civilian pilot training program. When the war began, 254 Delta State students joined the armed forces. When the war ended, student enrollment at Delta State increased from 185 to 483, aided by the federal program for veterans known as the [[GI Bill]] to encourage education.<ref name=\"deltastate.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1228.asp |title=Timeline 2 |publisher=Deltastate.edu |accessdate=2012-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207204348/http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1228.asp |archive-date=2012-02-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1947 session of the Delta Council, [[Dean Acheson]] (Under-Secretary of State in Truman's administration) delivered a speech on campus that unveiled the [[Marshall Plan]]. He detailed plans for  postwar relief and investment in Europe to help the nations recover from destruction.<ref name=\"deltastate.edu\"/>\n\nIn 1955, the name ''Delta State Teachers College'' was changed to ''Delta State College''. Delta State earned full accreditation from the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] in 1963. It developed graduate programs, which it opened for admission in 1965. Given graduate program and research development, in 1974 the state legislature authorized the college to be named as the current ''Delta State University''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1229.asp |title=Timeline 3 |publisher=Deltastate.edu |accessdate=2012-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606205609/http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1229.asp |archive-date=2012-06-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1965 Delta State initiated a graduate program (Master of Education in Elementary Education, Elementary Supervision, Guidance, English, History, Math, Music, Social Studies, Business Education, Physical Education, and Science).<ref name=\"deltastate1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1228.asp|title=Timeline 2 \u2013 Delta State University|accessdate=2015-06-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207204348/http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1228.asp|archive-date=2012-02-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1925 to 1967 the university had a White-only race admission policy. Twelve years after the US Supreme Court decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), ruling that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional and three years after passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the state and administration ended [[racial segregation]] at DSU. Shirley Antoinette Washington was the first African-American student to enroll at DSU that year.<ref name=\"deltastate1\"/>\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the university developed an aviation program, which continues.\n\nIn 2005 Delta State assisted evacuees from [[Hurricane Katrina]] by opening Hugh White Hall as temporary housing.\n\n===Presidents===\n* James Wesley Broom \u2013 1925\u20131926\n* Dr. William Marion Kethley \u2013 1926\u20131956\n* Dr. James Milton Ewing \u2013 1956\u20131971\n* [[Aubrey K.

Particularly famous facilities at Delta State University are the large natatorium for holding swimming competitions, the Bologna Performing Arts Center (pictured left) with two theaters (one that seats 1,178, and another that seats 135), and the sound recording studios of the Delta Music Institute.\n\n==Mascots==\nDelta State has two mascots (one official, one unofficial). Since its inception, Delta State's sports teams have officially been known as the Statesmen because of the role State Rep. Walter Sillers, Jr. played in the location of the school in Cleveland. Sillers was speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives for 20 years. The female teams are called the Lady Statesmen.\n\nHowever, since the late 1980s, the student body has embraced a mascot that depicts a piece of [[okra]] wearing boxing gloves and brandishing a fierce expression.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/05/23/Columns/In_nickname_realm__Fi.shtml|title=Columns: In nickname realm, Fighting Okra snappiest|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref> The \"Fighting Okra\" grew out of humor among students about the improbability that anyone would find a \"Statesman\" particularly frightening. In the mid-1990s, a student vote was taken, resulting in the university taking on \"The Fighting Okra\" as an unofficial mascot. The \"Fighting Okra\" was featured in the \"Okraphobia\" episode of the [[Food Network]] show ''[[Good Eats]]''.<ref>[http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1073.asp?item=1827 \"Delta State's Okra mascot to appear on Food Network's ''Good Eats''\"]</ref>\n\nThe popularity of \"The Fighting Okra\" grew so much that many myths started on how the mascot came to be, the most popular of these stating there was a stubborn okra plant at first base on the baseball field that grew back every time it was cut. The true origin of the fighting okra mascot was a discussion between basketball and baseball players in the \"Court of Governors\" dormitory. The Statesman mascot was temporarily prohibited from participating in athletic activities after a physical altercation with the Mississippi College's Choctaw mascot at a basketball game. Basketball player Houston Williamson was lamenting the fact that \"Fighting Statesmen\" was not particularly frightening to their opponents. All present agreed that an alternative mascot would have to be mean and green. After a lively discussion and many suggestions, baseball pitcher Bob Black suggested that okra was green, fuzzy, and tough. The DSU baseball team began using the chant \"Okra! Okra! Okra! Okra!\" at DSU basketball games.\n\n==Academics==\nDelta State provides an undergraduate curriculum, offering 12 baccalaureate degrees in 42 majors. The university also advances student training through certain fields by providing graduate programs of study for eight master's degrees, the [[Education Specialist]] degree, and the [[Doctor of Education]] degree.\n* College of Arts and Sciences<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/249.asp|title=College of Arts and Sciences \u2013 Delta State University|work=deltastate.edu|accessdate=15 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627172811/http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/249.asp|archive-date=2013-06-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* College of Business<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/250.asp|title=College of Business \u2013 Delta State University|work=deltastate.edu|accessdate=15 September 2015}}</ref>\n* College of Education<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/251.asp|title=College of Education and Human Sciences \u2013 Delta State University|work=deltastate.edu|accessdate=15 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726140356/http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/251.asp|archive-date=2013-07-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* School of Nursing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/252.asp|title=School of Nursing \u2013 Delta State University|work=deltastate.edu|accessdate=15 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|Delta State Statesmen and Lady Statesmen}}\n[[File:13290-LSC Football Festival-8563 (9778068981).jpg|thumb|The Delta State football team in action against the [[Texas A&M\u2013Commerce Lions]] in 2013]]\nThe Delta State University Department of Athletics sponsors thirteen intercollegiate sports, competing at the [[NCAA Division II]] level.

On February 19, 1924, Senators William B. Roberts and Arthur Marshall cosponsored Senate Bill No. 236, which established Delta State Teachers College, which Mississippi Governor [[Henry L. Whitfield]] signed on April 9, 1924;<ref>{{harvp|Gunn|Castle|1980|p=11}}</ref> the bill had been sponsored in the [[Mississippi House of Representatives]] by [[Nellie Nugent Somerville]], the first woman to serve in the Mississippi state legislature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/legislators/Mississippi.html|title=Women Wielding Power-Mississippi|work=nwhm.org|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> The three buildings were Hill Hall, an administration and classroom building, Hardee Hall, a men's dormitory, and Taylor Hall, a women's dormitory.\n\nOn February 14, 1924, James Wesley Broom was appointed president of the college, and the college opened its doors on September 15, 1925. In May 1926, Broom died following complications from an ear infection. William Zeigel was named his successor. The seal of the college was designed in 1928 as a project of an art class.<ref>{{harvp|Gunn|Castle|1980|p=40}}</ref>\n\nWorld War II greatly affected the college. Anticipating the war in 1941, the college created a civilian pilot training program. When the war began, 254 Delta State students joined the armed forces. When the war ended, student enrollment at Delta State increased from 185 to 483, aided by the federal program for veterans known as the [[GI Bill]] to encourage education.<ref name=\"deltastate.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1228.asp |title=Timeline 2 |publisher=Deltastate.edu |accessdate=2012-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207204348/http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1228.asp |archive-date=2012-02-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1947 session of the Delta Council, [[Dean Acheson]] (Under-Secretary of State in Truman's administration) delivered a speech on campus that unveiled the [[Marshall Plan]]. He detailed plans for  postwar relief and investment in Europe to help the nations recover from destruction.<ref name=\"deltastate.edu\"/>\n\nIn 1955, the name ''Delta State Teachers College'' was changed to ''Delta State College''. Delta State earned full accreditation from the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] in 1963. It developed graduate programs, which it opened for admission in 1965. Given graduate program and research development, in 1974 the state legislature authorized the college to be named as the current ''Delta State University''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1229.asp |title=Timeline 3 |publisher=Deltastate.edu |accessdate=2012-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606205609/http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1229.asp |archive-date=2012-06-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1965 Delta State initiated a graduate program (Master of Education in Elementary Education, Elementary Supervision, Guidance, English, History, Math, Music, Social Studies, Business Education, Physical Education, and Science).<ref name=\"deltastate1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1228.asp|title=Timeline 2 \u2013 Delta State University|accessdate=2015-06-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207204348/http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1228.asp|archive-date=2012-02-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1925 to 1967 the university had a White-only race admission policy. Twelve years after the US Supreme Court decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), ruling that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional and three years after passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the state and administration ended [[racial segregation]] at DSU. Shirley Antoinette Washington was the first African-American student to enroll at DSU that year.<ref name=\"deltastate1\"/>\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the university developed an aviation program, which continues.\n\nIn 2005 Delta State assisted evacuees from [[Hurricane Katrina]] by opening Hugh White Hall as temporary housing.\n\n===Presidents===\n* James Wesley Broom \u2013 1925\u20131926\n* Dr. William Marion Kethley \u2013 1926\u20131956\n* Dr. James Milton Ewing \u2013 1956\u20131971\n* [[Aubrey K.

Particularly famous facilities at Delta State University are the large natatorium for holding swimming competitions, the Bologna Performing Arts Center (pictured left) with two theaters (one that seats 1,178, and another that seats 135), and the sound recording studios of the Delta Music Institute.\n\n==Mascots==\nDelta State has two mascots (one official, one unofficial). Since its inception, Delta State's sports teams have officially been known as the Statesmen because of the role State Rep. Walter Sillers, Jr. played in the location of the school in Cleveland. Sillers was speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives for 20 years. The female teams are called the Lady Statesmen.\n\nHowever, since the late 1980s, the student body has embraced a mascot that depicts a piece of [[okra]] wearing boxing gloves and brandishing a fierce expression.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/05/23/Columns/In_nickname_realm__Fi.shtml|title=Columns: In nickname realm, Fighting Okra snappiest|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref> The \"Fighting Okra\" grew out of humor among students about the improbability that anyone would find a \"Statesman\" particularly frightening. In the mid-1990s, a student vote was taken, resulting in the university taking on \"The Fighting Okra\" as an unofficial mascot. The \"Fighting Okra\" was featured in the \"Okraphobia\" episode of the [[Food Network]] show ''[[Good Eats]]''.<ref>[http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1073.asp?item=1827 \"Delta State's Okra mascot to appear on Food Network's ''Good Eats''\"]</ref>\n\nThe popularity of \"The Fighting Okra\" grew so much that many myths started on how the mascot came to be, the most popular of these stating there was a stubborn okra plant at first base on the baseball field that grew back every time it was cut. The true origin of the fighting okra mascot was a discussion between basketball and baseball players in the \"Court of Governors\" dormitory. The Statesman mascot was temporarily prohibited from participating in athletic activities after a physical altercation with the Mississippi College's Choctaw mascot at a basketball game. Basketball player Houston Williamson was lamenting the fact that \"Fighting Statesmen\" was not particularly frightening to their opponents. All present agreed that an alternative mascot would have to be mean and green. After a lively discussion and many suggestions, baseball pitcher Bob Black suggested that okra was green, fuzzy, and tough. The DSU baseball team began using the chant \"Okra! Okra! Okra! Okra!\" at DSU basketball games.\n\n==Academics==\nDelta State provides an undergraduate curriculum, offering 12 baccalaureate degrees in 42 majors. The university also advances student training through certain fields by providing graduate programs of study for eight master's degrees, the [[Education Specialist]] degree, and the [[Doctor of Education]] degree.\n* College of Arts and Sciences<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/249.asp|title=College of Arts and Sciences \u2013 Delta State University|work=deltastate.edu|accessdate=15 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627172811/http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/249.asp|archive-date=2013-06-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* College of Business<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/250.asp|title=College of Business \u2013 Delta State University|work=deltastate.edu|accessdate=15 September 2015}}</ref>\n* College of Education<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/251.asp|title=College of Education and Human Sciences \u2013 Delta State University|work=deltastate.edu|accessdate=15 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726140356/http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/251.asp|archive-date=2013-07-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* School of Nursing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/252.asp|title=School of Nursing \u2013 Delta State University|work=deltastate.edu|accessdate=15 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|Delta State Statesmen and Lady Statesmen}}\n[[File:13290-LSC Football Festival-8563 (9778068981).jpg|thumb|The Delta State football team in action against the [[Texas A&M\u2013Commerce Lions]] in 2013]]\nThe Delta State University Department of Athletics sponsors thirteen intercollegiate sports, competing at the [[NCAA Division II]] level.

During those years, DSU played in the NCAA tournament 16 times, with 11 appearances in the [[Elite Eight]]. Clark's 1988\u201389 team became the first NCAA team to win a National Championship on its home floor. During his career, Clark compiled a record of 206\u201338 (.845) in [[Gulf South Conference]] Games.

Ludhiana City, to its residents, consists of the Old City and the New City (or the residential and official quarters of the colonial British encampment, traditionally known as Civil Lines; this is as opposed to the Army Lines, which are no longer extant as the British Cantonment was abandoned in 1845).\n\nThe land dips steeply to the north and the west where, before 1785, the river [[Sutlej]] ran.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe Old Fort was at the banks of the Sutlej (and now houses the College of Textile Engineering). Legend has it that a tunnel connects it to the fort in [[Phillaur]]&nbsp;\u2013 although why this should be is debatable, as the Sutlej was the traditional dividing line between the principalities, often occupied by enemy forces (see History section).\n\nThe ground is of yellow sandstone and granite, forming small hillocks, plateaus and dips.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe tree of largest natural extraction was the kikar, or Acacia indica, but has been supplanted by the eucalyptus, transplanted from rural Australia in the late 1950s by the government of Chief Minister [[Pratap Singh Kairon]].\n\nGulmohars and jacarandas were planted by the British along the avenues of Civil Lines, as were other flowering trees, while the Old City contains almost no vegetation or parks, except for a few isolated [[Ficus religiosa|pipal]] trees, holy to the Hindus, as it is supposed to be the abode of Lord Shiva.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Climate==\nLudhiana features a [[semi-arid]] climate under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with three defined seasons; summer, monsoon and winter.

This light transit system will serve about 25 years to Ludhiana. There will be two corridors in Ludhiana Metro. These two corridors of metro will give relief to many roads to some extent.\n\n===City transportation===\nCity bus service has been cancelled. Moving around inside the city is done mostly by city-buses, auto-rickshaws, and [[cycle rickshaw]]s, while latest [[Ludhiana BRTS]] was planned to be constructed but due to lack of funds allotted and weak planning and management the project too has been scrapped by the government thus worsening the traffic problems in the industrial city.\n\n===Auto rickshaw===\nThe [[Auto rickshaw]] is a three-wheel drive vehicle, which is one way to travel in the city. They have the capacity to hold three to six passengers. It can be hired individually or on a sharing basis. The auto rickshaws are easily available at every major place, including the interstate bus terminal and the railway station at a nominal fare which varies from \u20a8 10 to \u20a8 30.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Jugnoo, an on demand auto rickshaw application launched its operations in February 2015 to provide low cost, reliable, 24 x 7 service to the citizens of Ludhiana.\n\n===Rickshaw===\nCycle rickshaws are widely used in Ludhiana. The rickshaw or tricycle is pulled by a person and is a relatively cheap way of travelling in the city, but has become pricey after the autos were being scrapped. Nowadays many electric rickshaws are also available in Ludhiana and most of them can be spotted on the road which connects Samrala Chowk to Station.\n\n===Taxi===\nRadio taxis are also easily available. This is the most used means of transport by the people of Ludhiana. Ola Cabs launched in the city on 7 October 2014.

Its distinctive aromatic and pleasantly sharp, very [[salt]]y flavour led to it being  preferred for some Italian pasta dishes with highly flavoured sauces, especially those of Roman origin, such as ''[[matriciana|bucatini all'amatriciana]]'', ''[[spaghetti alla carbonara]]'', and [[cacio e pepe|''spaghetti cacio e pepe'']] (of which it is a main ingredient). The sharpness depends on the period of maturation, which varies from five months for a table cheese to eight months or longer for a grating cheese. Most pecorino cheeses are  classified as [[Grana (cheese)|grana]] and are granular, hard and sharply flavored.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cheesemonthclub.com/pecorino-romano|title=Pecorino Romano|website=The Gourmet Cheese of the Month Club|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\nThere are other regional types of [[pecorino]] cheese. [[Pecorino Toscano]] (from [[Tuscany]]) and [[Pecorino Sardo]] (from Sardinia) are not particularly salty, and are generally eaten as they are, rather than grated and used as a cooking ingredient. In the United States \"[[Romano cheese]]\" is sold; it is not based on real pecorino Romano, but is a milder cheese made with cow's milk.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sardinian (sheep)|Sardinian sheep]]\n* [[List of ancient dishes|List of ancient dishes and foods]]\n* [[List of Italian PDO cheeses]]\n* [[List of sheep milk cheeses]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{in lang|it}} [http://www.milkonline.com/fiera/cheese/disciplinari/Pecorino%20Romano.htm Production requirements]\n* {{in lang|it}} [http://www.pecorinoromano.com Consorzio per la Tutela del Formaggio Pecorino Romano (Consortium for the Protection of Pecorino Romano Cheese)]\n\n{{Italian cheeses}}\n\n[[Category:Italian cheeses]]\n[[Category:Sheep's-milk cheeses]]\n[[Category:Italian products with protected designation of origin]]\n[[Category:Cuisine of Sardinia]]\n[[Category:Cuisine of Lazio]]\n[[Category:Cheeses with designation of origin protected in the European Union]]\n\n[[de:Pecorino (K\u00e4se)#Pecorino romano, DOP]]\n", "name_user": "Mezze stagioni", "label": "safe", "comment": "wikilink", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecorino_Romano"}

They lived in [[Rumbai]] district, where Luhut attended Yayasan Cendana Elementary School, which was owned by Caltex. He later attended junior high school in [[Pekanbaru]]. Luhut became a keen swimmer, practicing in the [[Siak River]], and represented Riau at a national sports event in 1962.

Luhut responded by ordering his men to fire warning shots, but he said this had no effect on the rioters. He then ordered his men to shoot at the legs of the rioters, and he suspected several were killed in the ensuing chaos as troops were not equipped with rubber bullets.

Gann's Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator (1946), in which Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, and 103\u00b0 is also where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were on that day.]]\nOne of the most controversial techniques that Gann used is that he converted the price directly to zodiac degrees.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> For example, if a commodity is trading at $120 per share, he would convert it to 120\u00b0 of the zodiac, which is 0\u00b0 Leo. If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0. Therefore, it will become 0\u00b0 Aries in the zodiac.\n\nHere is an example from a private letter to a client on the coffee market:<ref name=\":5\" /> \n* The high in the May Coffee Santos D on 19 March 1954 was 8729.\n** Using a scale of one point to one degree, 8729\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 \u00d7 24 + 89\u00b0, and 89\u00b0 is 29\u00b0 Gemini. \n** Using a scale of 30 points to one degree, 8729\u00b0/30 = 291\u00b0, and 291\u00b0 is 21\u00b0 Capricorn. \n** Using a scale of 12 points to one degree, 8729\u00b0/12 = 727.5\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 \u00d7 2 + 7.5\u00b0, and 7.5\u00b0 is 7\u00b030\u2019 Aries. \n** Using a scale of one cent (100 points) to one degree, 8729\u00b0/100 = 87.29\u00b0, and 87.29\u00b0 is 27\u00b017\u2019 Gemini\n\n=== Gann angles ===\n{{main|Gann angles}}\nGann described the use of angles in the [[stock market]] in ''The Basis of My Forecasting Method'' (1935).

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time. When one draws a perfect square and then draw a diagonal line from one corner of the square to the other, it illustrates the concept of the 1x1 angle which moves up one point per day.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxYA1U7JZ6oC&pg=PA26&dq=%27%27The+Basis+of+My+Forecasting+Method%27%27+gann&client=firefox-a\n|title=Forecasting profits using price & time\n|last=Gately\n|first=Edward\n|publisher=John Wiley and Sons\n|year=1998\n|accessdate=2009-03-25\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fibonacci Analysis|last=Brown|first=Constance M.|publisher=Bloomberg Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1576602614|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHere is an example from a private letter of Gann to a client on the coffee market:<ref name=\":5\" />\n* The high in the May Coffee Santos D on 19 March 1954 was 8729.\n* The low on 16 April 1932 was 435.

Gann|300x300px]]Very similar to the Spiral Chart, the Hexagon Chart is also a matrix of consecutive natural numbers, but the difference is that it starts with 0 in the central point, and the numbers spiral out in the form of a hexagon instead a square.<ref name=\":3\" /> The spiral direction in Gann's original course is also counterclockwise, because of its astrological overlay.<ref name=\":4\" /> Mathematically, the numbers in each additional layer represent the [[hexagonal number]]s, which are the number of distinct dots consisting of the outlines of regular hexagons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wonders of Numbers: Adventures in Mathematics, Mind, and Meaning|last=Pickover|first=Clifford A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0195157994|location=New York: NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, it is found that Gann used the following method to overlay planetary positions on the Hexagon Chart:<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n* The axis going from 0 to 1,11, 28, and so on are 60\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 2, 10, 24, and so on are 120\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 3, 12, 27, and so on are 180\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 4, 14, 30, and so on are 240\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 5, 10, 24, and so on are 300\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 6, 10, 24, and so on are 0\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]].\n\nAgain, the above mathematical relationship could be demonstrated by this mathematical formula:<ref name=\":18\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Integers on the cardinal angles (60\u00b0\u00d7) of the Hexagon Chart\n!{{diagonal split header|Layer|Degree}}\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |60\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |120\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |180\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |240\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |300\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |360\u00b0\n|-\n!1\n|1\n|2\n|3\n|4\n|5\n|6\n|-\n!2\n|8\n|10\n|12\n|14\n|16\n|18\n|-\n!3\n|21\n|24\n|27\n|30\n|33\n|36\n|-\n!4\n|40\n|44\n|48\n|52\n|56\n|60\n|-\n!5\n|65\n|70\n|75\n|80\n|85\n|90\n|-\n!n\n|3n\u00b2\u22122n\n|3n\u00b2\u2212n\n|3n\u00b2\n|3n\u00b2+n\n|3n\u00b2+2n\n|3(n\u00b2+n)\n|}\n\n===== Mathematical formula of the Hexagon Chart =====\nLike the Spiral Chart, there are two methods of calculation.<ref name=\":13\" /> The first one is simpler not as accurate as the second one.\n\n====== Method 1 ======\nSimilar to the Spiral Chart, for any natural number P>1, its approximate angular value A (in degrees) is given by:\n\nA\u209a = MOD[210\u00d7P<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212180,360]\u00b0\n\nFor example, from the Hexagon Chart, it is known that the angular value of 44 is 120\u00b0.

The corn top price was \u00a2137, which was around 104\u00b0, thus the three points loosely formed a Grand Trine.]]\nAccording to Patrick Mikula,<ref name=\":3\" /> the rule of using the Spiral Chart or the Hexagon Chart is as follows:\n\n# Identify the planetary combination(s) which governs the price movements of the commodity. For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0.

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time.

Gann|300x300px]]Very similar to the Spiral Chart, the Hexagon Chart is also a matrix of consecutive natural numbers, but the difference is that it starts with 0 in the central point, and the numbers spiral out in the form of a hexagon instead a square.<ref name=\":3\" /> The spiral direction in Gann's original course is also counterclockwise, because of its astrological overlay.<ref name=\":4\" /> Mathematically, the numbers in each additional layer represent the [[hexagonal number]]s, which are the number of distinct dots consisting of the outlines of regular hexagons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wonders of Numbers: Adventures in Mathematics, Mind, and Meaning|last=Pickover|first=Clifford A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0195157994|location=New York: NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, it is found that Gann used the following method to overlay planetary positions on the Hexagon Chart:<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n* The axis going from 0 to 1,11, 28, and so on are 60\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 2, 10, 24, and so on are 120\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 3, 12, 27, and so on are 180\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 4, 14, 30, and so on are 240\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 5, 10, 24, and so on are 300\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 6, 10, 24, and so on are 0\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]].\n\nAgain, the above mathematical relationship could be demonstrated by this mathematical formula:<ref name=\":18\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Integers on the cardinal angles (60\u00b0\u00d7) of the Hexagon Chart\n!{{diagonal split header|Layer|Degree}}\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |60\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |120\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |180\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |240\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |300\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |360\u00b0\n|-\n!1\n|1\n|2\n|3\n|4\n|5\n|6\n|-\n!2\n|8\n|10\n|12\n|14\n|16\n|18\n|-\n!3\n|21\n|24\n|27\n|30\n|33\n|36\n|-\n!4\n|40\n|44\n|48\n|52\n|56\n|60\n|-\n!5\n|65\n|70\n|75\n|80\n|85\n|90\n|-\n!n\n|3n\u00b2\u22122n\n|3n\u00b2\u2212n\n|3n\u00b2\n|3n\u00b2+n\n|3n\u00b2+2n\n|3(n\u00b2+n)\n|}\n\n===== Mathematical formula of the Hexagon Chart =====\nLike the Spiral Chart, there are two methods of calculation.<ref name=\":13\" /> The first one is simpler not as accurate as the second one.\n\n====== Method 1 ======\nSimilar to the Spiral Chart, for any natural number P>1, its approximate angular value A (in degrees) is given by:\n\nA\u209a = MOD[210\u00d7P<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212180,360]\u00b0\n\nFor example, from the Hexagon Chart, it is known that the angular value of 44 is 120\u00b0. Substitute P with 36 into the above formula:\n\nA\u2084\u2084 = MOD[210\u00d744<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212180,360]\u00b0 = 132.98\u00b0 which is roughly equal to 120\u00b0 on the chart.\n\n====== Method 2 ======\nTo find the exact angle on the Hexagon Chart, one has to use a slightly more complicated formula below.\n\nA\u209a = 180\u00b0\u2212(3r\u2092\u00b2\u2212P)\u00d760\u00b0\u00f7r\u2092\n\nWhere r\u2092 = (P\u00f73)<sup>\u00bd</sup>\n\nLet us take 44 as an example:\n\n(44/3)<sup>\u00bd</sup> = 3.8297, r\u2092 = 4\n\nA\u2084\u2084 = 180\u00b0\u2212(3\u00d74\u00b2-44)\u00d760\u00b0\u00f74 = 120\u00b0\n\n==== Practical examples ====\n[[File:The_Hexagon_Chart_and_the_Corn_Market_Top_in_March_1925.jpg|thumb|300x300px|In March, Saturn was at 224\u00b0 and Venus was at 344\u00b0. The corn top price was \u00a2137, which was around 104\u00b0, thus the three points loosely formed a Grand Trine.]]\nAccording to Patrick Mikula,<ref name=\":3\" /> the rule of using the Spiral Chart or the Hexagon Chart is as follows:\n\n# Identify the planetary combination(s) which governs the price movements of the commodity. For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.
