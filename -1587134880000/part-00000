History is replete with examples of large-scale depopulations. Many wars, for example, have been accompanied by significant depopulations. Before the 20th century, population decline was mostly due to disease, starvation, epidemic or emigration. The [[Black Death]] in Europe, the arrival of [[Old World]] diseases to the [[Americas]], the [[tsetse fly]] invasion of the [[Waterberg Massif]] in [[South Africa]], and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] all caused sizable population declines. In modern times, the [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]] caused declines in the population of some African countries. Less frequently, population declines are caused by [[genocide]] or mass [[execution]]; for example, in the 1970s, the population of [[Cambodia]] declined because of wide-scale executions by the [[Khmer Rouge]].\n\n==Underpopulation==\nSometimes the term '''underpopulation''' is applied to a specific economic system does not refer to [[carrying capacity]], and is not a term in opposition to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], which deals with the total possible population  can be sustained by available food, water, sanitation and other infrastructure. \"Underpopulation\" is usually defined as a state in which a country's population has declined too much to support its current economic system. Thus the term has nothing to do with the biological aspects of carrying capacity, but is an economic employed to imply that the [[transfer payment]] schemes of some developed countries might fail once the population declines to a certain point. An example would be if retirees were supported through a [[social security]] system which does not invest savings, and then a large emigration movement occurred. In this case, the younger generation may not be able to support the older generations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Positive effects of a population decline==\nA long-term decline in birth rates has a positive effect on the labour market due a decreasing number of job applicants.

Nations can acquire territory or lose territory, and groups of people can acquire or lose citizenship, e.g. [[statelessness|stateless]] persons, indigenous people, and illegal immigrants or long-stay foreign residents. Political instability can make it difficult to conduct a census in certain regions. Further, a country's population could rise in summer and decline in winter as deaths increase in winter in cold regions; a long census interval could show a rise in population when the population has already tipped into decline.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[White nationalists]] use evidence of a declining birth rate in support of their extremist views and calls to violence.<ref name=\"BetuelE\">{{cite web |last1=Betuel |first1=Emma |title=CDC Data on Declining US Fertility Rate Is Being Used by White Nationalists |date=January 13, 2019 |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/52409-cdc-fertility-report-race-breakdown-white-nationalism |website=Inverse |language=en}}</ref> Lower fertility rates are generally associated with dramatic increases in population health and longevity.<ref name=\"ESHRE\">{{cite journal |author=ESHRE Capri Workshop Group |title=Noncontraceptive health benefits of combined oral contraception |journal=Human Reproduction Update |date=1 October 2005 |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=513\u2013525 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmi019 |pmid=16006440 |language=en |issn=1355-4786|doi-access=free }}</ref> Increasing populations are not necessary to maintain [[economic growth]] and [[Social determinants of health|social vitality]] because of advances in [[automation]] and workers living healthy lives much longer into old age.

History is replete with examples of large-scale depopulations. Many wars, for example, have been accompanied by significant depopulations. Before the 20th century, population decline was mostly due to disease, starvation, epidemic or emigration. The [[Black Death]] in Europe, the arrival of [[Old World]] diseases to the [[Americas]], the [[tsetse fly]] invasion of the [[Waterberg Massif]] in [[South Africa]], and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] all caused sizable population declines. In modern times, the [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]] caused declines in the population of some African countries. Less frequently, population declines are caused by [[genocide]] or mass [[execution]]; for example, in the 1970s, the population of [[Cambodia]] declined because of wide-scale executions by the [[Khmer Rouge]].\n\n==Underpopulation==\nSometimes the term '''underpopulation''' is applied to a specific economic system does not refer to [[carrying capacity]], and is not a term in opposition to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], which deals with the total possible population  can be sustained by available food, water, sanitation and other infrastructure. \"Underpopulation\" is usually defined as a state in which a country's population has declined too much to support its current economic system. Thus the term has nothing to do with the biological aspects of carrying capacity, but is an economic employed to imply that the [[transfer payment]] schemes of some developed countries might fail once the population declines to a certain point. An example would be if retirees were supported through a [[social security]] system which does not invest savings, and then a large emigration movement occurred. In this case, the younger generation may not be able to support the older generations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Positive effects of a population decline==\nA long-term decline in birth rates has a positive effect on the labour market due a decreasing number of job applicants.

Political instability can make it difficult to conduct a census in certain regions.

Furthermore, the UN predicts that by the end of the 21st century (the period 2095-2100) three of these regions will be showing population decline and global population growth will be zero.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Annual Percent Change of Population for Three Periods in the Future<ref name=\":4\" />\n!Region\n!2020-25\n!2045-50\n!2095-2100\n|-\n|Africa\n|2.4%\n|1.7%\n|0.6%\n|-\n|Asia\n|0.8\n|0.1\n| -0.4\n|-\n|Europe\n|0.0\n| -0.3\n| -0.1\n|-\n|Latin America & the Caribbean\n|0.8\n|0.2\n| -0.5\n|-\n|Oceania\n|1.2\n|0.8\n|0.4\n|-\n|The World\n|1.0\n|0.5\n|0.0\n|}\n\nThe table shows that the UN predicts long-term decline of population growth rates in every region; however, short-term baby booms and healthcare improvements, among other factors, can cause reversals of trends.

They found that fertility well above replacement and population growth would typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement and population stability would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility moderately below replacement and population decline would maximize standards of living when the cost of providing capital for a growing labor force is taken into account.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Ronald|last2=Mason|first2=Andrew|last3=members of the NTA Network|title=Is Low Fertility Really a Problem?

This summer art camp and year-long artist residency draws young artists from around the world, and perfects their skills in visual arts, music, dance, acting, writing, and film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interlochen.org/|title=Interlochen Center for the Arts|website=www.interlochen.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nInterlochen takes its name from the [[Latin]] \"''inter''\", meaning \"between\", and the [[Scottish Gaelic]] \"''lochen''\", meaning lakes.\n\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, members of the [[Odawa]] people lived between the lakes they called ''Wahbekaness'' and ''Wahbekanetta'' (now named Duck Lake and Green Lake, respectively). Beginning in the late 19th century, European settlers began [[logging]] and [[Fishing industry|fishing]] industries in the area, and founded the small town of '''Wylie'''. Because of logging, the [[Chicago and West Michigan Railway]] built a line between [[Manistee, Michigan|Manistee]] and [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]], which met with the [[Manistee and North-Eastern Railroad]]. These railroads intercepted in current-day downtown Interlochen.\n\nAs the lumber industry grew, the area became more deforested, until in 1917 the [[Michigan|state of Michigan]] purchased the remaining virgin pines and created [[Interlochen State Park]], the first organized [[state park]] in Michigan (as [[Mackinac Island State Park|Mackinac Island]] was a state park before Interlochen).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.interlochen.org/about/history_1 | title=History of Interlochen | publisher=Interlochen Center for the Arts | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015230026/http://www.interlochen.org/about/history_1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-15}}</ref> In 1928, the National High School Orchestra Camp was founded at Interlochen and evolved to become [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]], which includes a summer camp as well as a fine arts boarding high school and public radio station. The camp has expanded to both sides of M-137 (designated as a highway to the arts camp in 1930<ref>{{Citation|last=Michigan|title=Official highway service map|date=1927|publisher=The Dept.|language=English|oclc=79754957|last2=State Highway Department|last3=H.M. Gousha Company}}</ref>), and enveloped the entire village of Wylie.\n\nIn the mid 20th century, the railroads that brought students to, and lumber through Interlochen, have been removed. The north-south M&NE railroad was removed in 1934<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michiganrailroads.com/evolution-of-michigan-railroads/182-evolution-lower-peninsula/evolution-1930s/4427-evolution-map-lower-1934|title=michiganrailroads.com - Evolution Map - Lower - 1934|website=www.michiganrailroads.com|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>, and the west-east C&WM railroad removed in 1982<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michiganrailroads.com/evolution-of-michigan-railroads/187-evolution-lower-peninsula/evolution-1980s/4479-evolution-map-lower-1982|title=michiganrailroads.com - Evolution Map - Lower - 1982|website=www.michiganrailroads.com|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>. Today, Interlochen has become noteworthy for its use of ecofriendly alternative transportation methods such as BATA's bike/scooter/skatetoy sharing initiative.\n\n==Geography==\nAs the name suggests, Interlochen is situated between the two lakes of the original Odawa settlement. It is {{convert|14|mi}} southwest of [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]] at {{coord|44|38|43|N|85|46|02|W|display=inline}}, and sits at an [[elevation]] of {{convert|841|ft}} above [[sea level]]. The [[ZIP Code]] is 49643.\n\n==Climate==\nInterlochen lies close to the [[45th parallel north]], approximately halfway between the equator and the north pole. It therefore experiences typical [[Northern Michigan]] weather: very cold in the winter, and very warm in the summer. Interlochen is close enough to Lake Michigan that it experiences heavy [[lake-effect snow]], but not close enough to be cooled by the Great Lake's breeze, furthering the extremes of the winter and summer seasons. However, other lake-effect precipitation in the summer is also present, causing lush greenery and magnificent thunderstorms, and making Interlochen picturesque in the summer as well as in the winter. However, to the distress of many longtime resident, Interlochen's recent fast economic growth and resulting construction has caused significant pollution to neighbouring lakes and forests. As a result, the aforementioned picturesque landscapes are temporarily on hold until the next American recession slows Interlochen's highrise development.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census|census]] of 2010, there were 583 people, 240 households, and 142 families residing in the Interlochen CDP. The [[population density]] was 470.0 people per square mile (181.5/km\u00b2). There were 277 housing units at an average density of 223.3 per square mile (86.2/km\u00b2).<ref name=\"Census 2010 DP-1\">{{Cite web| url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/SF1DP1/1600000US2640800| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Interlochen CDP, Michigan| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American Factfinder| accessdate=December 19, 2016| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213134600/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/SF1DP1/1600000US2640800| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the racial makeup of the CDP was 52.2% [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|White]], 43.2% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], 0.5% [[African-American]] or [[Black people|Black]], 0.2% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 0.2% some other race, and 1.7% from two or more races. 1.9% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]], who can be of any race.<ref name=\"Census 2010 DP-1\"/>\n\nIn the CDP, the population was spread out with 25.4% under the age of 18, 8.9% from 18 to 24, 33.3% from 25 to 44, 24.0% from 45 to 64, and 8.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.3 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.6 males.<ref name=\"Census 2010 DP-1\"/>\n\n==Government==\nThe Village of Interlochen is an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] and does not have its own [[local government]], but is governed locally by [[Green Lake Township, Michigan|Green Lake Township]]. The township offices are located in Interlochen.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.greenlaketownship.org/ | title= Green Lake Township Web Site | publisher=Green Lake Township Board | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> Some governmental services are also provided by the county.\n[[Interlochen Center for the Arts]] also provides its own form of non-governmental security who provide the community with constant video and motion surveillance that extends from its campus buildings and dorm rooms to the local woods area. The service diligently monitors the students living in the area and provide severe and nonjudicial punishment to those who make minor offences. This service has been controversial in the expulsion of its most talented students, often permanently damaging their artistic careers.\n\n\n==Media==\nInterlochen is home to 88.7 [[WIAA (FM)|WIAA]], which is run by the Interlochen Center for the Arts and operates as Northern Michigan's [[National Public Radio]] affiliate. The station has been under recent controversy due to its daily broadcast of inflated crop yield numbers and documentation of recent arrests, which have been described by some as propaganda by the state.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Quiet Time (84292503).jpeg|thumb|Lake DuBonnet, just northwest of Interlochen]]\n\n=== Highways ===\n\n*{{jct|state=MI|US|31}} runs along the northern edge of Interlochen. The highway mainly parallels the [[Lake Michigan]] shore, and runs for {{convert|356|mi|km}} in a northerly direction from the [[Indiana]]-Michigan state line southwest of [[Niles, Michigan|Niles]] to its terminus at [[Interstate 75|I-75]] south of [[Mackinaw City]].\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|137}} is a {{convert|2.89|mi|km|adj=on}} north-south spur between US&nbsp;31 at the north end and [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]] and [[Interlochen State Park]] at the southern terminus (the road continues south as Grand Traverse County Road 137, also known as Karlin Road).\n\n===Public transportation===\nInterlochen is served by Traverse City's public transportation system, the Bay Area Transportation Authority (BATA) which serves most of the Grand Traverse region with [[dial-a-ride]] services. BATA debuted its first hybrid bus in December 2005. BATA recently completed a bus transfer terminal on Hall Street in Traverse City, which opened July 21, 2006. The terminal is used to transfer riders to different buses on different routes. BATA also links riders to the Greyhound terminal for regional and long-distance travel.\n\nGiven the long dirt and gravel roads that cover much of Interlochen and its surrounding area, in 2011, BATA began an experimental transit program consisting of rentable skateboards, scooters, bicycles and cross country skis (only available during the winter seasons). The program is largely targeted at the area's sizeable student population. \n\n===General Aviation===\n[[File:Kresge Auditorium-Interlochen.jpg|thumb|Kresge Auditorium, located within Interlochen Center for the Arts]]\nInterlochen can be reached by any airplane, helicopter or jet propelled airski able to utilize turf runways at the [[Green Lake Airport]] (Y88)\n\n== See Also ==\n\n* [[List of

is an [[unincorporated community]] and [[census-designated place]] (CDP) in [[Green Lake Township, Michigan|Green Lake Township]], [[Grand Traverse County, Michigan|Grand Traverse County]], [[Michigan]], United States. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the Interlochen [[census-designated place]] (CDP) had a population of 583.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US2640800| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Interlochen CDP, Michigan| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American Factfinder| accessdate=December 19, 2016}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThe community is noted for the internationally renowned [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]]. This summer art camp and year-long artist residency draws young artists from around the world, and perfects their skills in visual arts, music, dance, acting, writing, and film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interlochen.org/|title=Interlochen Center for the Arts|website=www.interlochen.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nInterlochen takes its name from the [[Latin]] \"''inter''\", meaning \"between\", and the [[Scottish Gaelic]] \"''lochen''\", meaning lakes.\n\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, members of the [[Odawa]] people lived between the lakes they called ''Wahbekaness'' and ''Wahbekanetta'' (now named Duck Lake and Green Lake, respectively). Beginning in the late 19th century, European settlers began [[logging]] and [[Fishing industry|fishing]] industries in the area, and founded the small village of '''Wylie''', one mile south of present-day Interlochen. Because of logging, the [[Manistee and North-Eastern Railroad]] (owned by the Buckley and Douglas Lumber Company of [[Manistee, Michigan|Manistee]]) extended it's line north from [[Nessen City, Michigan|Nessen City]] and arrived between the lakes in the fall of 1889. Similarly, the [[Chicago and West Michigan Railway]] extended it's line north from [[Baldwin, Michigan|Baldwin]] on it's way to [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]] in 1890. The two lines crossed in current-day downtown Interlochen where a depot and [[interlocking]] tower were located. The original townsite, however, was platted just south of the depot along either side of the M&NE rail line in late 1889 or early 1890, with the business district centering on current [[M-137]] and Riley Rd/10th Street.\n\nAs the lumber industry grew, the area became more deforested. However, it was predicted from the beginning that the area would become a popular summer resort, and so Buckley and Douglas set aside 186 acres of virgin pines between Duck and Green lakes for preservation. The result was '''Pine Park''', a public retreat boasting virgin forests and pristine lakes. A small railroad depot named Pine Park Station was built. Visitors began flocking to the region during the warmer months to camp, fish, boat, and escape the heat of the crowded cities. Piggybacking on the vacation boom, local businessman Willis Pennington purchased land adjacent to Pine Park on the banks of Green Lake and opened the Pennington Hotel in 1909.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://crescendo.interlochen.org/story/timber-tourism-how-conservation-shaped-interlochen-michigan}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1910's, local representatives became worried that Pine Park would soon be logged off and so they lobbied the [[Michigan|Michigan Legislature]] for help. The state ultimately allocated $60,000 in 1917 to purchase the property<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-350-79133_79205_85747_86991_88871_90785---,00.html|title=DNR - Michigan's first state park|website=www.michigan.gov|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>, and the newly acquired parkland was dedicated as '''The Pines''', later renamed [[Interlochen State Park]], the first [[state park]] organized by the state of Michigan ([[Mackinac Island State Park|Mackinac Island]] was originally a national park before becoming Michigan's first state park in 1895).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.interlochen.org/about/history_1 | title=History of Interlochen | publisher=Interlochen Center for the Arts | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015230026/http://www.interlochen.org/about/history_1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-15}}</ref> In 1928, the National High School Orchestra Camp was founded at Interlochen and evolved to become [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]], which includes a summer camp as well as a fine arts boarding high school and public radio station. The camp has expanded to both sides of M-137 (designated as a highway to the arts camp in 1930<ref>{{Citation|last=Michigan|title=Official highway service map|date=1927|publisher=The Dept.|language=English|oclc=79754957|last2=State Highway Department|last3=H.M. Gousha Company}}</ref>), and enveloped the entire village of Wylie.\n\nBy the late 20th century, the railroads that brought students, vacationers, and lumber through Interlochen, had been removed. The north-south M&NE railroad was removed in 1934<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michiganrailroads.com/evolution-of-michigan-railroads/182-evolution-lower-peninsula/evolution-1930s/4427-evolution-map-lower-1934|title=michiganrailroads.com - Evolution Map - Lower - 1934|website=www.michiganrailroads.com|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>, and the west-east C&WM railroad ([[Pere Marquette Railway]] after 1899) removed in 1982<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michiganrailroads.com/evolution-of-michigan-railroads/187-evolution-lower-peninsula/evolution-1980s/4479-evolution-map-lower-1982|title=michiganrailroads.com - Evolution Map - Lower - 1982|website=www.michiganrailroads.com|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>. The area remains a popular vacation spot, with hiking, fishing, camping, boating, swimming, cross country skiing, and snowmobiling the most popular activities.\n\n==Geography==\nAs the name suggests, Interlochen is situated between the two lakes of the original Odawa settlement. It is {{convert|14|mi}} southwest of [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]] at {{coord|44|38|43|N|85|46|02|W|display=inline}}, and sits at an [[elevation]] of {{convert|841|ft}} above [[sea level]]. The [[ZIP Code]] is 49643.\n\n==Climate==\nInterlochen lies close to the [[45th parallel north]], approximately halfway between the equator and the north pole. It therefore experiences typical [[Northern Michigan]] weather: very cold in the winter, and very warm in the summer. Interlochen is close enough to Lake Michigan that it experiences heavy [[lake-effect snow]], but not close enough to be cooled by the Great Lake's breeze, furthering the extremes of the winter and summer seasons. However, other lake-effect precipitation in the summer is also present, causing lush greenery and magnificent thunderstorms, and making Interlochen picturesque in the summer as well as in the winter.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census|census]] of 2010, there were 583 people, 240 households, and 142 families residing in the Interlochen CDP. The [[population density]] was 470.0 people per square mile (181.5/km\u00b2). There were 277 housing units at an average density of 223.3 per square mile (86.2/km\u00b2).<ref name=\"Census 2010 DP-1\">{{Cite web| url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/SF1DP1/1600000US2640800| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Interlochen CDP, Michigan| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American Factfinder| accessdate=December 19, 2016| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213134600/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/SF1DP1/1600000US2640800| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the racial makeup of the CDP was 52.2% [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|White]], 43.2% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], 0.5% [[African-American]] or [[Black people|Black]], 0.2% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 0.2% some other race, and 1.7% from two or more races. 1.9% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]], who can be of any race.<ref name=\"Census 2010 DP-1\"/>\n\nIn the CDP, the population was spread out with 25.4% under the age of 18, 8.9% from 18 to 24, 33.3% from 25 to 44, 24.0% from 45 to 64, and 8.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.3 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.6 males.<ref name=\"Census 2010 DP-1\"/>\n\n==Government==\nThe Village of Interlochen is an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] and does not have its own [[local government]], but is governed locally by [[Green Lake Township, Michigan|Green Lake Township]]. The township offices are located in Interlochen.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.greenlaketownship.org/ | title= Green Lake Township Web Site | publisher=Green Lake Township Board | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> Some governmental services are also provided by the county.\n\n\n==Media==\nInterlochen is home to 88.7 [[WIAA (FM)|WIAA]], which is run by the Interlochen Center for the Arts and operates as Northern Michigan's [[National Public Radio]] affiliate. \n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Quiet Time (84292503).jpeg|thumb|Lake DuBonnet, just northwest of Interlochen]]\n\n=== Highways ===\n\n*{{jct|state=MI|US|31}} runs along the northern edge of Interlochen. The highway mainly parallels the [[Lake Michigan]] shore, and runs for {{convert|356|mi|km}} in a northerly direction from the [[Indiana]]-Michigan state line southwest of [[Niles, Michigan|Niles]] to its terminus at [[Interstate 75|I-75]] south of [[Mackinaw City]].\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|137}} is a {{convert|2.89|mi|km|adj=on}} north-south spur between US&nbsp;31 at the north end and [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]] and [[Interlochen State Park]] at the southern terminus (the road continues south as Grand Traverse County Road 137, also known as Karlin Road).\n\n===Public transportation===\nInterlochen is served by Traverse City's public transportation system, the Bay Area Transportation Authority (BATA) which serves most of the Grand Traverse region with [[dial-a-ride]] services. BATA debuted its first hybrid bus in December 2005. BATA recently completed a bus transfer terminal on Hall Street in Traverse City, which opened July 21, 2006. The terminal is used to transfer riders to different buses on different routes. BATA also links riders to the Greyhound terminal for regional and long-distance travel.\n\nGiven the long dirt and gravel roads that cover much of Interlochen and its surrounding area, in 2011, BATA began an experimental transit program consisting of rentable skateboards, scooters, bicycles and cross country skis (only available during the winter seasons). The program is largely targeted at the area's sizeable student population. \n\n===General Aviation===\n[[Green Lake Airport]] (Y88) is located three miles south of Interlochen.\n\n== See Also ==\n\n* [[List of boarding schools in the United States]]\n* [[List of lakes of Michigan]]\n* [[Kingsley, Michigan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.interlochenchamber.org/ Interlochen Chamber of Commerce]\n*[http://www.interlochen.org/ Interlochen Center for the Arts]\n*[http://www.ricsfoodcenter.com/ Interlochen Ric's Food Center]\n*[http://www.bata.net/ Bay Area Transportation Authority]\n\n{{Grand Traverse County, Michigan}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Grand Traverse County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Traverse City micropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Census-designated places in Grand Traverse County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Census-designated places in Michigan]]\n", "name_user": "69.159.18.46", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Undid revision 951508319 byMr.Sarcastic(talk))", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlochen,_Michigan"}

The 1910 set had a total of 36 cards, each one featuring an illustration of a player.<ref>[http://starrcards.com/history-of-hockey-cards/ History of Hockey Cards] on Starr Cards website</ref> After [[World War I]], only one more cigarette set was issued, during the 1924-25 season by Champ's Cigarettes. NHL player [[Billy Coutu]]'s biography includes an example of one of the 40 cards issued at that time.\n\nDuring the 1920s, some hockey cards were printed by food and candy companies, such as Paulin's Candy, Maple Crispette, Crescent, Holland Creameries and La Patrie.\n\nThrough to 1941, [[O-Pee-Chee]] printed hockey cards, stopping production for [[World War II]]. Presumably, the 1941 involvement of the US in the war affected the hockey card market, since Canada had been in the war since 1939.\n\nHockey cards next appeared during 1951-52, issued by Toronto's [[Parkhurst Products]].  Brooklyn's [[Topps]] Chewing Gum began printing hockey cards in 1954-1955.  Parkhurst and Topps did not produce cards for the 1955-56 season but returned for 1957-58.\n\nIn the 1960s, some hockey card and hockey coin sets were issued by food companies, including [[Shirriff|Shirriff Desserts]], Salada Tea and York Peanut Butter. \n\nOther companies to manufacture hockey cards include [[Pinnacle Brands|Pinnacle]], Pacific, [[Pro Set Inc.|Pro Set]], [[Upper Deck]], [[In The Game Trading Cards|In The Game]], [[Panini Group|Panini]], [[Score Entertainment|Score]], and various early 1990s manufacturers (7th Inning Sketch, Classic, etc.). Esso briefly issued stamp-sized hockey cards on soft paper in the early 1970s in return for gas purchases.\n\n===Post lockout hockey cards (2005-present)===\nAfter the [[NHL|National Hockey League]] lockout that wiped out the 2004-05 NHL season, the hockey card market changed dramatically. Prior to the lockout, [[Upper Deck Company|Upper Deck]], Pacific, Topps and [[In The Game Trading Cards]] were all licensed by the NHL and [[National Hockey League Players Association|NHLPA]] to produce trading cards featuring NHL players and logos.

In July 1942, having just completed the first two of the series, N\u00e9mirovsky was arrested as a Jew and detained at [[Pithiviers]] and then [[Auschwitz]], where she was murdered, a victim of the [[Holocaust]]. The notebook containing the two novels was preserved by her daughters but not examined until 1998. They were published in a single volume entitled ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' in 2004.\n\n==Background==\nThe sequence was to portray life in France in the period following June 1940, the month in which the German army rapidly defeated the French and fought the British; Paris and northern France came under [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]] on 14 June. The first novel, ''Temp\u00eate en juin'' (''Storm in June'') depicts the flight of citizens from Paris in the hours preceding the German advance and in the days following it. The second, ''Dolce'' (''Sweet''), shows life in a small French country town, Bussy (in the suburbs just east of Paris), in the first, strangely peaceful, months of the German occupation. These first two novels seem able to exist independently from each other{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} on first reading. The links between them are rather tenuous; as N\u00e9mirovsky observes in her notebook, it is the history and not the characters, that unite them.\n\nThe third novel, ''Captivit\u00e9'' (''Captivity''), for which N\u00e9mirovsky left a plot outline, would have shown the coalescing of a resistance, with some characters introduced in ''Temp\u00eate en juin'' and ''Dolce'' having been arrested and put under threat of death, in Paris. The fourth and fifth novels would perhaps have been called ''Batailles'' (''Battles'') and ''La Paix'' (''Peace'') but these exist only as titles in N\u00e9mirovsky's notebook, against which she had placed question marks. Nothing can be said about the plots of ''Batailles'' and ''La Paix''. To quote N\u00e9mirovsky's notes, they are \"in limbo, and what limbo! It's really in the lap of the gods since it depends on what happens\".\n\n==Books==\n\n===''Temp\u00eate en juin''===\n\nThe narrative follows several groups of characters who encounter one another rarely if at all. All are impelled to flee from Paris in advance of the German entry into the city. As transport and distribution collapse under German bombardment, all have to change their plans and nearly all lose the veneer of civilization.\n\nThe P\u00e9ricands are making for [[N\u00eemes]], where they have property. They reach the city but in the course of the journey, Charlotte P\u00e9ricand's senile father-in-law is left behind (forgotten) while her second son, Hubert, runs away to join the army and shares in its collapse. Her elder son, Philippe, is a priest and is shepherding a party of orphans, who eventually kill him (in a death scene perhaps in need of revision, N\u00e9mirovsky comments in her notebook, because it is ''melo'' [melodramatic]). Gabriel Corte, a well-known writer, flees with his mistress and makes for [[Vichy]], where he may or may not find refuge and employment. Charles Langelet, an aesthete, flees alone in his car, filching petrol from trusting acquaintances in order to get as far as the [[Loire]]; he returns to Paris and is killed, accidentally and memorably.\n\nMaurice and Jeanne Michaud, minor employees at a bank, are instructed to go to [[Tours]] though deprived at the last minute of the transport promised by their employer. Their son, Jean-Marie is with the army and they have no word of his fate. They cannot get to Tours and eventually return to Paris, unemployed and almost destitute but destined to survive. Jean-Marie is in fact wounded; he is being tended by the Sabarie family at their small farm near Bussy, where he is nursed back to health by Madeleine, the Sabaries' foster daughter. At the end of the novel as postal services are restored, Jean-Marie is able to contact his family and return to Paris. The Michauds, alone among major characters, grow in moral stature as chaos spreads.\n\n===''Dolce''===\nThe small town of Bussy and its neighbouring farms are the scene throughout. The German occupation seems sweetly peaceful but there is no doubt over the balance of power. The Germans get whatever they ask for; official notices promise the death penalty for those who disobey their regulations, and French collaborators, including the P\u00e9ricands, make their own settlement with their German overlords.\n\nThe main plot concerns Lucile Angellier, whose unfaithful husband is a prisoner of war. She lives uneasily, with her mother-in-law. Theirs being the best house in the village, it is where the German commander, Bruno von Falk, an accomplished musician, is billeted. Unwillingly Lucile finds herself falling in love with him. In this and several parallel strands, the novel explores the deep, perhaps unbridgeable, differences and the perhaps superficial sympathies, between military Germans and rural French.\n\nThe minor plot concerns the family of Beno\u00eet Sabarie, a prisoner of war who escapes from German captivity, returns home to the family farm near Bussy, marries his fianc\u00e9e Madeleine and believes (with some justification) that she still pines for Jean-Marie Michaud, whom she nursed during his recovery. Jealous by nature, Beno\u00eet also believes that Madeleine risks being seduced by the German interpreter, Bonnet, who is billeted in their house. Caught poaching, arrested for possessing a gun, Beno\u00eet struggles free and shoots Bonnet dead. (In her notebook, N\u00e9mirovsky mentions a possible revision where Bonnet is wounded, not killed.)\n\nThe stories come together when, at Madeleine's request, Lucile conceals Beno\u00eet in her house. It is widely assumed that Bruno's presence in the house and his liking for Lucile, will protect her against searches. The need to conceal Beno\u00eet brings Lucile and her mother-in-law closer; it drives her apart from Bruno, though he never knows why.\n\nAfter an astonishing and powerful scene in which German troops celebrate the first anniversary of their entry into Paris, ''Dolce'' ends in July 1941, when Germany begins its [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. The troops occupying Bussy are posted to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Lucile and Bruno fear that he will not survive and she has no difficulty in persuading him to give her a travel document and petrol coupon, which (unknown to him) will enable her to drive Beno\u00eet to a new refuge. The title of ''Dolce'', like that of the whole sequence, intentionally recalls musical terminology, ''dolce'' means \"sweet\" or \"soft\" in musicians' Italian. This title is truthful but also ironic, since bitterness exists under the surface, and a far less peaceful sequel was to follow.\n\n===''Captivit\u00e9''===\n\nThe plot of N\u00e9mirovsky's third novel exists as a plot outline, with some contradictions, in her notebook. Beno\u00eet has \"friends\" (the nascent Communist resistance) in Paris. Lucile drives him to the city, where he is concealed by the Michauds, whom the Angelliers met briefly in ''Temp\u00eate en juin''. In Paris, Beno\u00eet and Jean-Marie Michaud are denounced and arrested, and in prison, they meet Hubert. Jean-Marie is pardoned by the Germans, when Lucile contacts Bruno von Falk on his behalf. Beno\u00eet and his friends organize an escape and release Jean-Marie and Hubert. Jean-Marie and Lucile meet and fall in love but after learning that she is still in love with Bruno, he leaves to fight against the Germans and dies heroically. On the Eastern Front, Bruno is also killed, Lucile losing her French and German beloveds. In a sub-plot, the writer Gabriel Corte, a relatively minor and unsympathetic character in ''Temp\u00eate en juin'', emerges as a propagandist and politician, initially collaborating with the Germans, later perhaps disaffected; Beno\u00eet dies brutally and full of hope.\n\n==The manuscript and its rediscovery==\n\n''Suite fran\u00e7aise'', so far as it was completed, was written in microscopic handwriting in a single notebook; ''Temp\u00eate'' and ''Dolce'' together filled 140 pages, corresponding to 516 published pages. It would possibly be the earliest work of literary fiction about [[the Second World War]], and is remarkable as a historical [[novel sequence]] written during the period that it depicts, transformed far beyond the level of a journal of events such as might be expected to emerge from the turmoil and tragedy N\u00e9mirovsky experienced.\n\nIt is extraordinary that the manuscript should have survived in such extreme circumstances, having been taken by Irene N\u00e9mirovsky's daughter Denise as she was being helped to flee from hiding place to hiding place during wartime.\n\nDenise, however, kept the notebooks containing the nearly indecipherable manuscript of ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' unread in an old suitcase for more than sixty years, convinced that it would indeed be a painful diary reminding her of the war that would not be beneficial to read. In the late 1990s, having made arrangements to contribute these manuscripts to a French archive, Denise decided to decipher the notebooks first, which resulted in the rediscovery of the original manuscripts of the fictional work ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' which she had published in association with publisher Olivier Rubinstein in France in 2004.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===French publication===\n''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' was published by Deno\u00ebl, Paris, in 2004. {{ISBN|2-207-25645-6}}; pocket edition (Folio) {{ISBN|2-07-033676-X}}. The edition includes a preface by {{ill|Myriam Anissimov|fr}}, notes by N\u00e9mirovsky about the revision and planned continuation of the sequence, and correspondence between N\u00e9mirovsky herself, her husband Michel Epstein, her publisher [[Albin Michel]] and others in the period before and after her deportation.\n\n''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' won the [[Prix Renaudot]] for 2004.

Both works have protagonists who work in finance, Marshall's [[protagonist]] is an accountant while N\u00e9mirovsky's work has several characters who work for a bank.  Both books were written during and/or immediately after the event but show significant reflection; they are not autobiographical works but fiction featuring invented characters.  The stories cover the prelude of the [[Battle of France|Nazi invasion]] and its aftermath but the events in the stories are much different.  Marshall's ends before the [[Military occupation|occupation]], while N\u00e9mirovsky's has significant portions devoted to it. \"Dolce,\" the second part of ''Suite fran\u00e7aise,'' is similar to ''[[Le Silence de la mer]]'', a novella by the French author ''Vercors'' (pseudonym of [[Jean Bruller]]). Both stories deal with a German officer, who in civilian life was a composer, who is quartered in the house of a young French woman. ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' and ''Le Silence de la Mer'' were finished in early 1942.\n\n===Controversy===\nSeveral reviewers and commentators<ref name=\"Nextbook: Behind the Legend\">[http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=414 Nextbook: Behind the Legend<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713004528/http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=414 |date=13 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2018357,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Truth, lies and anti-semitism | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | date=22 February 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> have raised questions regarding N\u00e9mirovsky's attitude toward Jews, her generally negative depiction of Jews in her writing and her use of anti-semitic publications in advancing her career.  A review of her work published in ''The New Republic'' states:<blockquote>\nN\u00e9mirovsky was the very definition of a [[self-hating Jew]]. Does that sound too strong? Well, here is a Jewish writer who owed her success in France ''entre deux guerres'' in no small measure to her ability to pander to the forces of reaction, to the fascist right. N\u00e9mirovsky's stories of corrupt Jews\u2014some of them even have hooked noses, no less!\u2014appeared in right-wing periodicals and won her the friendship of her editors, many of whom held positions of power in extreme-right political circles.

Their son, Jean-Marie is with the army and they have no word of his fate. They cannot get to Tours and eventually return to Paris, unemployed and almost destitute but destined to survive. Jean-Marie is in fact wounded; he is being tended by the Sabarie family at their small farm near Bussy, where he is nursed back to health by Madeleine, the Sabaries' foster daughter. At the end of the novel as postal services are restored, Jean-Marie is able to contact his family and return to Paris. The Michauds, alone among major characters, grow in moral stature as chaos spreads.\n\n===''Dolce''===\nThe small town of Bussy and its neighbouring farms are the scene throughout. The German occupation seems sweetly peaceful but there is no doubt over the balance of power. The Germans get whatever they ask for; official notices promise the death penalty for those who disobey their regulations, and French collaborators, including the P\u00e9ricands, make their own settlement with their German overlords.\n\nThe main plot concerns Lucile Angellier, whose unfaithful husband is a prisoner of war. She lives uneasily, with her mother-in-law. Theirs being the best house in the village, it is where the German commander, Bruno von Falk, an accomplished musician, is billeted. Unwillingly Lucile finds herself falling in love with him. In this and several parallel strands, the novel explores the deep, perhaps unbridgeable, differences and the perhaps superficial sympathies, between military Germans and rural French.\n\nThe minor plot concerns the family of Beno\u00eet Sabarie, a prisoner of war who escapes from German captivity, returns home to the family farm near Bussy, marries his fianc\u00e9e Madeleine and believes (with some justification) that she still pines for Jean-Marie Michaud, whom she nursed during his recovery. Jealous by nature, Beno\u00eet also believes that Madeleine risks being seduced by the German interpreter, Bonnet, who is billeted in their house. Caught poaching, arrested for possessing a gun, Beno\u00eet struggles free and shoots Bonnet dead. (In her notebook, N\u00e9mirovsky mentions a possible revision where Bonnet is wounded, not killed.)\n\nThe stories come together when, at Madeleine's request, Lucile conceals Beno\u00eet in her house. It is widely assumed that Bruno's presence in the house and his liking for Lucile, will protect her against searches. The need to conceal Beno\u00eet brings Lucile and her mother-in-law closer; it drives her apart from Bruno, though he never knows why.\n\nAfter an astonishing and powerful scene in which German troops celebrate the first anniversary of their entry into Paris, ''Dolce'' ends in July 1941, when Germany begins its [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. The troops occupying Bussy are posted to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Lucile and Bruno fear that he will not survive and she has no difficulty in persuading him to give her a travel document and petrol coupon, which (unknown to him) will enable her to drive Beno\u00eet to a new refuge. The title of ''Dolce'', like that of the whole sequence, intentionally recalls musical terminology, ''dolce'' means \"sweet\" or \"soft\" in musicians' Italian. This title is truthful but also ironic, since bitterness exists under the surface, and a far less peaceful sequel was to follow.\n\n===''Captivit\u00e9''===\n\nThe plot of N\u00e9mirovsky's third novel exists as a plot outline, with some contradictions, in her notebook. Beno\u00eet has \"friends\" (the nascent Communist resistance) in Paris. Lucile drives him to the city, where he is concealed by the Michauds, whom the Angelliers met briefly in ''Temp\u00eate en juin''. In Paris, Beno\u00eet and Jean-Marie Michaud are denounced and arrested, and in prison, they meet Hubert. Jean-Marie is pardoned by the Germans, when Lucile contacts Bruno von Falk on his behalf. Beno\u00eet and his friends organize an escape and release Jean-Marie and Hubert. Jean-Marie and Lucile meet and fall in love but after learning that she is still in love with Bruno, he leaves to fight against the Germans and dies heroically. On the Eastern Front, Bruno is also killed, Lucile losing her French and German beloveds. In a sub-plot, the writer Gabriel Corte, a relatively minor and unsympathetic character in ''Temp\u00eate en juin'', emerges as a propagandist and politician, initially collaborating with the Germans, later perhaps disaffected; Beno\u00eet dies brutally and full of hope.\n\n==The manuscript and its rediscovery==\n\n''Suite fran\u00e7aise'', so far as it was completed, was written in microscopic handwriting in a single notebook; ''Temp\u00eate'' and ''Dolce'' together filled 140 pages, corresponding to 516 published pages. It would possibly be the earliest work of literary fiction about [[the Second World War]], and is remarkable as a historical [[novel sequence]] written during the period that it depicts, transformed far beyond the level of a journal of events such as might be expected to emerge from the turmoil and tragedy N\u00e9mirovsky experienced.\n\nIt is extraordinary that the manuscript should have survived in such extreme circumstances, having been taken by Irene N\u00e9mirovsky's daughter Denise as she was being helped to flee from hiding place to hiding place during wartime.\n\nDenise, however, kept the notebooks containing the nearly indecipherable manuscript of ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' unread in an old suitcase for more than sixty years, convinced that it would indeed be a painful diary reminding her of the war that would not be beneficial to read. In the late 1990s, having made arrangements to contribute these manuscripts to a French archive, Denise decided to decipher the notebooks first, which resulted in the rediscovery of the original manuscripts of the fictional work ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' which she had published in association with publisher Olivier Rubinstein in France in 2004.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===French publication===\n''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' was published by Deno\u00ebl, Paris, in 2004. {{ISBN|2-207-25645-6}}; pocket edition (Folio) {{ISBN|2-07-033676-X}}. The edition includes a preface by {{ill|Myriam Anissimov|fr}}, notes by N\u00e9mirovsky about the revision and planned continuation of the sequence, and correspondence between N\u00e9mirovsky herself, her husband Michel Epstein, her publisher [[Albin Michel]] and others in the period before and after her deportation.\n\n''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' won the [[Prix Renaudot]] for 2004. This is the first time that the prize has been awarded posthumously.\n\n===Translations===\nAn English translation by Sandra Smith was published by Chatto & Windus, London, 2004, and by Knopf, New York, in 2006. {{ISBN|1-4000-4473-1}}.

Both works have protagonists who work in finance, Marshall's [[protagonist]] is an accountant while N\u00e9mirovsky's work has several characters who work for a bank.  Both books were written during and/or immediately after the event but show significant reflection; they are not autobiographical works but fiction featuring invented characters.  The stories cover the prelude of the [[Battle of France|Nazi invasion]] and its aftermath but the events in the stories are much different.  Marshall's ends before the [[Military occupation|occupation]], while N\u00e9mirovsky's has significant portions devoted to it. \"Dolce,\" the second part of ''Suite fran\u00e7aise,'' is similar to ''[[Le Silence de la mer]]'', a novella by the French author ''Vercors'' (pseudonym of [[Jean Bruller]]). Both stories deal with a German officer, who in civilian life was a composer, who is quartered in the house of a young French woman. ''Suite fran\u00e7aise'' and ''Le Silence de la Mer'' were finished in early 1942.\n\n===Controversy===\nSeveral reviewers and commentators<ref name=\"Nextbook: Behind the Legend\">[http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=414 Nextbook: Behind the Legend<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713004528/http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=414 |date=13 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2018357,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Truth, lies and anti-semitism | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | date=22 February 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> have raised questions regarding N\u00e9mirovsky's attitude toward Jews, her generally negative depiction of Jews in her writing and her use of anti-semitic publications in advancing her career.  A review of her work published in ''The New Republic'' states:<blockquote>\nN\u00e9mirovsky was the very definition of a [[self-hating Jew]]. Does that sound too strong? Well, here is a Jewish writer who owed her success in France ''entre deux guerres'' in no small measure to her ability to pander to the forces of reaction, to the fascist right. N\u00e9mirovsky's stories of corrupt Jews\u2014some of them even have hooked noses, no less!\u2014appeared in right-wing periodicals and won her the friendship of her editors, many of whom held positions of power in extreme-right political circles.
