This typically occurs in the area overlying [[lymphoid tissue|lymphoid]] aggregates. These neutrophils, along with [[lymphocyte|mononuclear cells]], may infiltrate the [[Crypts of Lieberkuhn|crypts]], leading to inflammation (crypititis) or abscess (crypt abscess).\n\n[[Granuloma]]s, aggregates of macrophage derivatives known as giant cells, are found in 50% of cases and are most specific for Crohn's disease. The granulomas of Crohn's disease do not show \"caseation\", a cheese-like appearance on microscopic examination characteristic of granulomas associated with infections, such as [[tuberculosis]]. Biopsies may also show chronic mucosal damage, as evidenced by blunting of the intestinal [[Intestinal villus|villi]], atypical branching of the crypts, and a change in the tissue type ([[metaplasia]]).

A disease of both the [[ileum]] (the last part of the small intestine that connects to the [[large intestine]]), and the large intestine, [[Ileocolic]] Crohn's accounts for fifty percent of cases. Crohn's ileitis, manifest in the ileum only, accounts for thirty percent of cases, while Crohn's colitis, of the large intestine, accounts for the remaining twenty percent of cases and may be particularly difficult to distinguish from ulcerative colitis.\n\nGastroduodenal Crohn's disease causes inflammation in the stomach and first part of the small intestine called the duodenum.

The chassis of the car was based on that of the [[Ferrari 250#250 GT SWB|250 GT SWB]], with minor differences in frame structure and geometry to reduce weight, stiffen and lower the chassis. The car was built around a hand-welded oval tube frame, incorporating [[Control arm|A-arm front suspension]], rear [[Beam axle#Live axle vs Dead axle|live-axle]] with [[Watt's linkage#Automobile suspension|Watt's linkage]], [[disc brake]]s, and [[Borrani]] wire wheels. The engine was the race-proven Tipo 168/62 Comp. {{cvt|2953|cc|L|1|order=flip}} [[V12 engine|V12]] as used in the [[Ferrari TR#250 Testa Rossa|250 Testa Rossa]] Le Mans winner.

The gearbox was a new 5-speed unit with [[Porsche]]-type [[synchromesh]].<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\n[[Bizzarrini]] focused his design effort on the car's aerodynamics in an attempt to improve top speed and stability. The body design was informed by wind tunnel testing at [[Pisa University]] as well as road and track testing with several prototypes. The resulting all-aluminium bodywork had a long, low nose, small radiator inlet, and distinctive air intakes on the nose with removable covers. Early testing resulted in the addition of a rear [[Spoiler (car)|spoiler]]. The underside of the car was covered by a belly pan and had an additional spoiler underneath formed by the fuel tank cover. The aerodynamic design of the 250 GTO was a major technical innovation compared to previous Ferrari GT cars, and in line with contemporary developments by manufacturers such as [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]]. The bodies were constructed by [[Scaglietti]], with the exception of early prototypes with bodies constructed in-house by Ferrari or by [[Pininfarina]] (in the case of s/n 2643 GT).

It was built to competition specification, which included a reinforced chassis, a competition gearbox and a ''Tipo 168/61'' 3.0 L engine tuned to 300 bhp, equipped with dry sump lubrication and six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. Pininfarina constructed a new lightweight aluminum alloy body for this prototype, which resembled that of the [[Ferrari America#400 Superamerica|400 Super America]] coupe. 2643 GT was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the [[1961 24 Hours of Le Mans|1961 24 hours of Le Mans]], driven by [[Fernand Tavano]] and [[Giancarlo Baghetti]].

The original chassis was extensively modified, including relocation of the engine mounts lower and further back in the frame. A competition-specification engine was fitted, including six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. The bodywork seen on the second prototype in period photos was rough, unfinished aluminum. The body's ungainly appearance lead the Ferrari team to nickname it \"Il Mostro\" (the Monster) and the press to call it \"The Anteater.\" Hammer marks, weld beads and bolted or riveted panels could be seen throughout, evidence of the continual modifications performed during factory testing in 1961. Although the body was crudely formed, it displayed features that would be seen in the production 250 GTO, including the overall profile of a low hood and high rear, triple front air intakes, engine bay cooling slots in the front fenders and plexiglass-covered headlights. The interior was hastily constructed and even more minimal than in the production 250 GTO, with scattered instrumentation and a bare aluminum dashboard.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\nThe second prototype was tested at [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza|Monza]] in September 1961 by Stirling Moss. Results were promising, as the prototype was able to lap the circuit faster than a 250 GT SWB. However, the high speed stability issues seen during testing of the first prototype remained. Shortly after this test, construction of the first production 250 GTOs began in late 1961 with chassis 3223 GT and 3387 GT. <ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\nAs the prototype was no longer needed for testing, the experimental body was scrapped. Regardless of the identity of the chassis, sources are in agreement that the second GTO prototype was either partially or entirely scrapped and is no longer extant in its 1961 form. If 2053 GT was indeed the chassis, it was then given a 250 GT SWB style body and sold to [[Jacques Swaters]]. 2053 GT crashed during the [[6 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring|1962 N\u00fcrburgring 1000 km]] and was then rebodied by [[Carrozzeria Sports Cars]].

Three new cars were produced to the 1964 specification, and four earlier 250 GTOs were retrofitted to it by the factory.<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />  This redesign was intended to maintain the GTO's competitiveness for one more year, as the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] decided to not approve the [[Ferrari 250 LM|250 LM]] for GT-class racing during the 1964 season. The Ferrari engineers incorporated many of the 250LM's aerodynamic features into the 1964 GTO. This resulted in a visual similarity between the two models, even though the GTO does not share the 250LM's [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|mid engine rear wheel drive]] layout. The factory also made minor modifications to the engine, gearbox, chassis, suspension and interior. Despite these changes, the overall performance improvement was slight.

Prices began to climb again in the late 90s and have continued to rise through the present day. 250 GTOs have repeatedly broken records for most expensive car ever sold at auction or private sale.<ref name=\"Hemmings-20180605\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg.com\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg.com-2\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.automobilemag.com/news/1962-ferrari-250-gto-brings-48400000-monterey-set-new-record/|title=1962 Ferrari 250 GTO Brings $48,400,000 in Monterey to Set New Record {{!}} Automobile Magazine|date=2018-08-27|work=Automobile Magazine|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/press_release/17205/|title=Bonhams : Ferrari 250 Gto Achieves $38,115,000 (\u00a322,843,633)A New World Auction Record At Bonhams Quail Lodge Sale|website=www.bonhams.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref> The current record for world's most expensive car was set in June 2018 when a 1963 250 GTO (chassis 4153GT) was sold to David MacNeil in a private sale for $70 million.<ref name=\"Hemmings-20180605\" /> On August 25, 2018, RM Sotheby's sold [[Greg Whitten]]'s 250 GTO 3413GT at their Monterey auction.<ref name=\":2\" /> The final price inclusive of buyer's fee was $48,405,000, representing a new record for most expensive car ever sold at auction.

The chassis of the car was based on that of the [[Ferrari 250#250 GT SWB|250 GT SWB]], with minor differences in frame structure and geometry to reduce weight, stiffen and lower the chassis. The car was built around a hand-welded oval tube frame, incorporating [[Control arm|A-arm front suspension]], rear [[Beam axle#Live axle vs Dead axle|live-axle]] with [[Watt's linkage#Automobile suspension|Watt's linkage]], [[disc brake]]s, and [[Borrani]] wire wheels. The engine was the race-proven Tipo 168/62 Comp. {{cvt|2953|cc|L|1|order=flip}} [[V12 engine|V12]] as used in the [[Ferrari TR#250 Testa Rossa|250 Testa Rossa]] Le Mans winner. An all-alloy design utilizing a [[dry sump]] and six 38DCN [[Weber carburetors]], it produced approximately {{convert|300|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} at 7500 rpm and {{convert|30|kgm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 5500 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]]. The gearbox was a new 5-speed unit with [[Porsche]]-type [[synchromesh]].<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\n[[Bizzarrini]] focused his design effort on the car's aerodynamics in an attempt to improve top speed and stability. The body design was informed by wind tunnel testing at [[Pisa University]] as well as road and track testing with several prototypes. The resulting all-aluminium bodywork had a long, low nose, small radiator inlet, and distinctive air intakes on the nose with removable covers. Early testing resulted in the addition of a rear [[Spoiler (car)|spoiler]]. The underside of the car was covered by a belly pan and had an additional spoiler underneath formed by the fuel tank cover. The aerodynamic design of the 250 GTO was a major technical innovation compared to previous Ferrari GT cars, and in line with contemporary developments by manufacturers such as [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]]. The bodies were constructed by [[Scaglietti]], with the exception of early prototypes with bodies constructed in-house by Ferrari or by [[Pininfarina]] (in the case of s/n 2643 GT). Cars were produced in many colours, with the most famous being the bright red \"Rosso Cina\".<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n[[File:Ferrari 250 GTO ser. no. 3647GT interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of 250 GTO (chassis 3647GT)|alt=Looking through open driver's window of a right-hand-drive car, showing brown steering wheel with three metal spokes, gear lever and dashboard]]\nThe [[Minimalism|minimalist]] interior of a 250 GTO reflects the car's racing intentions.

It was built to competition specification, which included a reinforced chassis, a competition gearbox and a ''Tipo 168/61'' 3.0 L engine tuned to 300 bhp, equipped with dry sump lubrication and six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. Pininfarina constructed a new lightweight aluminum alloy body for this prototype, which resembled that of the [[Ferrari America#400 Superamerica|400 Super America]] coupe. 2643 GT was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the [[1961 24 Hours of Le Mans|1961 24 hours of Le Mans]], driven by [[Fernand Tavano]] and [[Giancarlo Baghetti]]. Although they were running as high as 8th overall, they were forced to retire at 4:45 am on Sunday morning due to engine failure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bluemel|first=Keith|date=November 2008|title=Sperimentale|url=|journal=Cavallino|volume=167|pages=36-43|via=}}</ref> During the course of the race, Ferrari engineers gathered information about the performance of the car which was used to modify and improve it, including the addition of a rear spoiler. During the Le Mans race, 2643 GT suffered from high-speed instability, possibly due to the front end design.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" /> Following Le Mans, 2643 GT returned to the factory, where it was used for more testing. The prototype raced again at the [[1962 Daytona 3 Hours|1962 Daytona Continental 3 hours]], where it placed 4th overall and 1st in the GT class driven by [[Stirling Moss]].<ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drive-my.com/en/test-drive/item/2180-the-green-ferrari-250-gto-test.html|title=The green Ferrari 250 GTO - track test|last=Doherty|first=Paul|date=14 April 2015|website=Drive|language=en-gb|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Subsequently, it was sold to [[North American Racing Team|N.A.R.T.]] and a succession of private owners.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/2643GT.250GT.htm|title=250 GT SWB Prototype Sperimentale s/n 2643GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe second prototype was also constructed from a donor car, although sources disagree on the chassis number and type.

The original chassis was extensively modified, including relocation of the engine mounts lower and further back in the frame. A competition-specification engine was fitted, including six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. The bodywork seen on the second prototype in period photos was rough, unfinished aluminum. The body's ungainly appearance lead the Ferrari team to nickname it \"Il Mostro\" (the Monster) and the press to call it \"The Anteater.\" Hammer marks, weld beads and bolted or riveted panels could be seen throughout, evidence of the continual modifications performed during factory testing in 1961. Although the body was crudely formed, it displayed features that would be seen in the production 250 GTO, including the overall profile of a low hood and high rear, triple front air intakes, engine bay cooling slots in the front fenders and plexiglass-covered headlights. The interior was hastily constructed and even more minimal than in the production 250 GTO, with scattered instrumentation and a bare aluminum dashboard.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\nThe second prototype was tested at [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza|Monza]] in September 1961 by Stirling Moss. Results were promising, as the prototype was able to lap the circuit faster than a 250 GT SWB. However, the high speed stability issues seen during testing of the first prototype remained. Shortly after this test, construction of the first production 250 GTOs began in late 1961 with chassis 3223 GT and 3387 GT. <ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\nAs the prototype was no longer needed for testing, the experimental body was scrapped. Regardless of the identity of the chassis, sources are in agreement that the second GTO prototype was either partially or entirely scrapped and is no longer extant in its 1961 form. If 2053 GT was indeed the chassis, it was then given a 250 GT SWB style body and sold to [[Jacques Swaters]]. 2053 GT crashed during the [[6 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring|1962 N\u00fcrburgring 1000 km]] and was then rebodied by [[Carrozzeria Sports Cars]]. Subsequently, 2053 GT was totally destroyed in an accident at the 1964 Spa 500km. <ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" /><ref name=\":16\" />\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=1961 250 GTO Prototype #2 \"The Anteater\"\n| align        = center\n| footer       =\n| style        =\n| state        =\n| height       =\n| width        =\n| captionstyle =\n| File:1961 Monza Ferrari 250 GTO prototype engine.jpg\n | alt1=\n | The second 250 GTO prototype during testing at Monza in 1961\n| File:1961 Ferrari 250 GTO prototype rear.jpg\n | alt2=\n | Rear view of 250 GTO prototype\n| File:1961 Ferrari 250 GTO prototype rr.jpg\n | alt3=\n | Note cooling vents in rear of front fender, which would also be used in the production 250 GTO\n| File:1961_Ferrari_250_GTO_prototype_left.jpg\n | alt4=\n | The low front profile shows the eventual shape of the production 250 GTO, while the rear still resembles a 250 GT SWB\n| File:1961 Ferrari 250 GTO prototype interior.jpg\n | alt5=\n | Prototype interior with extensive instrumentation in an unfinished aluminium dashboard\n}}\n\n===Variants and related models===\nHandbuild production, updates, and repairs throughout each car's competition history result in differences both visible and invisible between individual 250 GTOs.

Three new cars were produced to the 1964 specification, and four earlier 250 GTOs were retrofitted to it by the factory.<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />  This redesign was intended to maintain the GTO's competitiveness for one more year, as the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] decided to not approve the [[Ferrari 250 LM|250 LM]] for GT-class racing during the 1964 season. The Ferrari engineers incorporated many of the 250LM's aerodynamic features into the 1964 GTO. This resulted in a visual similarity between the two models, even though the GTO does not share the 250LM's [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|mid engine rear wheel drive]] layout. The factory also made minor modifications to the engine, gearbox, chassis, suspension and interior. Despite these changes, the overall performance improvement was slight.
