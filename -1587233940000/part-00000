[[OECD]], 2012.]]\nThe '''economy of Luxembourg''' is largely dependent on the banking, steel, and industrial sectors. [[Luxembourg]]ers enjoy the highest per capita gross domestic product in the world (CIA 2018 est.). Luxembourg is seen as a diversified industrialized nation, contrasting the oil boom in Qatar, the major monetary source of the southwest [[Asia]]n state.\n\nAlthough Luxembourg in tourist literature is aptly called the \"Green Heart of Europe\", its pastoral land coexists with a highly industrialized and export-intensive area. Luxembourg's economy is quite similar to Germany's. Luxembourg enjoys a degree of economic prosperity very rare among industrialized democracies.\n\nIn 2009, a budget deficit of 5% resulted from government measures to stimulate the economy, especially the banking sector, as a result of the world economic crisis. This was however reduced to 1.4% in 2010.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lu.html \"Luxembourg\"], ''CIA \u2013 The World Fact Book''. Retrieved 8 September 2010.</ref>\n\nFor 2017 the (expected) figures are as follows:  Growth 4.6%; Inflation 1.0%; Budget deficit 1.7%, to be reduced to 0.8% in 2020; Debt: 20.4%, no new debts to be taken in the fiscal year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.lu/letzebuerg/964929.html|title=Pierre Gramegna: Scholdespiral gebrach a Staat stellt an|date=2016-10-13|publisher=RTL.lu|accessdate=12 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Sectors==\nIn 2013 the GDP was $60.54 billion of which services, including the financial sector, produced 86%.

In the 2019 [[Global Financial Centres Index]], Luxembourg was ranked as having the 25th most competitive financial center in the world, and third most competitive in Europe after [[Economy of London#Financial services|London]] and [[Z\u00fcrich#Economy|Z\u00fcrich]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longfinance.net/images/gfci/gfci_21.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000617/http://www.longfinance.net/images/gfci/gfci_21.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-06-11|title=The Global Financial Centres Index 21|date=March 2017|publisher=Long Finance}}</ref> The country has specialised in the cross-border [[fund administration]] business. As Luxembourg's domestic market is relatively small, the country's financial centre is predominantly international. At the end of March 2009, there were 152 banks in Luxembourg, with over 27,000 employees. Political stability, good communications, easy access to other European centres, skilled multilingual staff, a tradition of banking secrecy and cross-border financial expertise have all contributed to the growth of the financial sector. These factors have contributed to a [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] of 8.3 and a DAW Index ranking of 10 in 2012; the latter the highest in Europe.<ref>Transparency International, 2008</ref> Germany accounts for the largest-single grouping of banks, with [[Scandinavia]]n, Japanese, and major US banks also heavily represented. Total assets exceeded \u20ac929 billion at the end of 2008. More than 9,000 holding companies are established in Luxembourg. The [[European Investment Bank]]\u2014the financial institution of the [[European Union]]\u2014is also located there.\n\nConcern about Luxembourg's banking secrecy laws, and its reputation as a tax haven, led in April 2009  to it being added to a \"grey list\" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the G20,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1061821.stm|title=Country profile: Luxembourg|last=|first=|date=2011-11-08|work=BBC|access-date=2018-12-31|language=en-GB}}</ref> a list from which it was removed in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/luxembourg-and-belgium-removed-from-grey-list-/65629.aspx|newspaper = European voice|title = Luxembourg and Belgium removed from \u2018grey list\u2019|date = 29 July 2009}}</ref> This concern has led Luxembourg to modify its tax legislation to avoid conflict with the tax authorities of European Union Members. For example, the classic tax exempt 1929 Holding Company was outlawed 31 December 2010, as it was deemed an illegal state aid by the European Commission.<ref>Luxembourg Company Registration [http://www.healyconsultants.com/company-incorporation/luxembourg-company-formation.html Healy Consultants] Retrieved 3 September 2013.</ref>\n\n===Steel===\nA key event in the economic history of Luxembourg was the 1876 introduction of English [[metallurgy]]. The refining process led to the development of the [[steel industry in Luxembourg]] and founding of the [[Arbed]] company in 1911.\n\nThe restructuring of the industry and increasing government ownership in [[Arbed]] (31%) began as early as 1974. As a result of timely modernization of facilities, cutbacks in production and employment, government assumption of portions of Arbed's debt, and recent cyclical recovery of the international demand for steel, the company is again profitable. Its productivity is among the highest in the world. US markets account for about 6% of Arbed's output. The company specializes in production of large architectural steel beams and specialized value-added products. There has been, however, a relative decline in the steel sector, offset by Luxembourg's emergence as a financial center. In 2001, through the merger with [[Aceralia]] and [[Usinor]], Arbed became [[Arcelor]]. Arcelor was taken over in 2006 by [[Mittal Steel]] to form [[Arcelor Mittal|Arcelor-Mittal]], helmed by [[Lakshmi Mittal]], the largest steel producer in the world.\n\n===Telecommunications===\n{{main|Telecommunications in Luxembourg}}\nGovernment policies promote the development of Luxembourg as an audiovisual and communications center. [[RTL Group|Radio-Television-Luxembourg]] is Europe's premier private radio and television broadcaster. The government-backed Luxembourg satellite company \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne des satellites\" (SES) was created in 1986 to install and operate a satellite telecommunications system for transmission of television programs throughout Europe. The first [[SES S.A.|SES]] [[Astra (satellite)|Astra]] satellite, the 16-channel RCA 4000 [[Astra 1A]], was launched by the [[Ariane (rocket)|Ariane Rocket]] in December 1988. [[SES S.A.|SES]] presently constitutes the world largest satellite services company in terms of revenue.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Luxembourg}}\n\nTourism is an important component of the national economy, representing about 8.3% of GDP in 2009 and employing some 25,000 people or 11.7% of the working population.<ref>[http://www.station.lu/?p=edito&a=external&id=107145 \"Lux is the place to be for business travellers\"], ''News 352'', 10 February 2011.

principles==\nEstablishing accounts depends on the size of companies, and referring to three criteria: total of the balance sheet (total of assets without losses of the accounting year), the net amount of the turnover (net, such as it appears on the profit and loss account) and the average number of the workforce.\n\nThe control of medium and big companies must be made by one or several independent auditors of companies, appointed by the general assembly among the members of the Institute of Independent Auditors of Companies.\nThe control of small companies must be made by an accountant appointed by the general assembly for definite duration.\nThe conclusion of the independent auditor\u2019s report can be:\n* A certificate without reserve, that is to say an approval\n* A certificate with reserves, that is to say that there is approval with reserves because of discords or doubts\n* A refusal to give a certificate\n\nThe accountants'' associations have difficulties getting organized because of the importance of the State in the accounting system.\n\n==Labour relations==\nLabour relations have been peaceful since the 1930s. Most industrial workers are organized by unions linked to one of the major political parties. Representatives of business, unions, and government participate in the conduct of major labour negotiations.\n\nForeign investors often cite Luxembourg's labour relations as a primary reason for locating in the Grand Duchy. Unemployment in 1999 averaged less than 2.8% of the workforce, but reached 4.4% by 2007.\n\n== Energy ==\n{{main|Energy in Luxembourg}}\nIn 1978, Luxembourg tried to build a 1,200 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] nuclear reactor but dropped the plans after threats of major protests.<ref>\"Reactors.\" ''Wise \u2013 Nuclear issues information services.''

The road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with 147&nbsp;km of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed [[TGV]] link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's [[Luxembourg railway station|railway station]] while a new passenger terminal at [[Luxembourg Airport]] has recently been opened. There are plans to introduce trams (first core line operative in end 2017) in the capital and light-rail lines in adjacent areas within the next few years.\nThe airport has known a sustained growth in passenger numbers during the last years ( 2015: 2.7 mio, 2020 : 4 mio expected), and the second stage of expansion is on its way.\n\n==Prospects==\nAccording to a note from the Luxembourg statistical agency, the Luxembourg economy was set to grow 4.0% in 2011. The economic situation was particularly dynamic in late 2010 and early 2011 but there were signs of a slowdown, both in the international economic environment and in terms of national indicators.<ref>[http://washington.mae.lu/en/Business-and-Economy \"Business and Economy\"], ''Embassy of Luxembourg in Washington''.

europe.svg|thumb|250px|The [[Workforce productivity|labour productivity]] level of Luxembourg is one of the highest in Europe. [[OECD]], 2012.]]\nThe '''economy of Luxembourg''' is largely dependent on the banking, steel, and industrial sectors. [[Luxembourg]]ers enjoy the highest per capita gross domestic product in the world (CIA 2018 est.).Luxembourg is seen as a diversified industrialized nation, contrasting the oil boom in Qatar, the major monetary source of the southwest [[Asia]]n state.\n\nAlthough Luxembourg in tourist literature is aptly called the \"Green Heart of Europe\", its pastoral land coexists with a highly industrialized and export-intensive area. Luxembourg's economy is quite similar to Germany's. Luxembourg enjoys a degree of economic prosperity very rare among industrialized democracies.\n\nIn 2009, a budget deficit of 5% resulted from government measures to stimulate the economy, especially the banking sector, as a result of the world economic crisis. This was however reduced to 1.4% in 2010.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lu.html \"Luxembourg\"], ''CIA \u2013 The World Fact Book''.

In the 2019 [[Global Financial Centres Index]], Luxembourg was ranked as having the 25th most competitive financial center in the world, and third most competitive in Europe after [[Economy of London#Financial services|London]] and [[Z\u00fcrich#Economy|Z\u00fcrich]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longfinance.net/images/gfci/gfci_21.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000617/http://www.longfinance.net/images/gfci/gfci_21.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-06-11|title=The Global Financial Centres Index 21|date=March 2017|publisher=Long Finance}}</ref> The country has specialised in the cross-border [[fund administration]] business. As Luxembourg's domestic market is relatively small, the country's financial centre is predominantly international. At the end of March 2009, there were 152 banks in Luxembourg, with over 27,000 employees. Political stability, good communications, easy access to other European centres, skilled multilingual staff, a tradition of banking secrecy and cross-border financial expertise have all contributed to the growth of the financial sector. These factors have contributed to a [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] of 8.3 and a DAW Index ranking of 10 in 2012; the latter the highest in Europe.<ref>Transparency International, 2008</ref> Germany accounts for the largest-single grouping of banks, with [[Scandinavia]]n, Japanese, and major US banks also heavily represented. Total assets exceeded \u20ac929 billion at the end of 2008. More than 9,000 holding companies are established in Luxembourg. The [[European Investment Bank]]\u2014the financial institution of the [[European Union]]\u2014is also located there.\n\nConcern about Luxembourg's banking secrecy laws, and its reputation as a tax haven, led in April 2009  to it being added to a \"grey list\" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the G20,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1061821.stm|title=Country profile: Luxembourg|last=|first=|date=2011-11-08|work=BBC|access-date=2018-12-31|language=en-GB}}</ref> a list from which it was removed in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/luxembourg-and-belgium-removed-from-grey-list-/65629.aspx|newspaper = European voice|title = Luxembourg and Belgium removed from \u2018grey list\u2019|date = 29 July 2009}}</ref> This concern has led Luxembourg to modify its tax legislation to avoid conflict with the tax authorities of European Union Members.

The refining process led to the development of the [[steel industry in Luxembourg]] and founding of the [[Arbed]] company in 1911.\n\nThe restructuring of the industry and increasing government ownership in [[Arbed]] (31%) began as early as 1974. As a result of timely modernization of facilities, cutbacks in production and employment, government assumption of portions of Arbed's debt, and recent cyclical recovery of the international demand for steel, the company is again profitable. Its productivity is among the highest in the world. US markets account for about 6% of Arbed's output. The company specializes in production of large architectural steel beams and specialized value-added products. There has been, however, a relative decline in the steel sector, offset by Luxembourg's emergence as a financial center. In 2001, through the merger with [[Aceralia]] and [[Usinor]], Arbed became [[Arcelor]]. Arcelor was taken over in 2006 by [[Mittal Steel]] to form [[Arcelor Mittal|Arcelor-Mittal]], helmed by [[Lakshmi Mittal]], the largest steel producer in the world.\n\n===Telecommunications===\n{{main|Telecommunications in Luxembourg}}\nGovernment policies promote the development of Luxembourg as an audiovisual and communications center. [[RTL Group|Radio-Television-Luxembourg]] is Europe's premier private radio and television broadcaster. The government-backed Luxembourg satellite company \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne des satellites\" (SES) was created in 1986 to install and operate a satellite telecommunications system for transmission of television programs throughout Europe. The first [[SES S.A.|SES]] [[Astra (satellite)|Astra]] satellite, the 16-channel RCA 4000 [[Astra 1A]], was launched by the [[Ariane (rocket)|Ariane Rocket]] in December 1988. [[SES S.A.|SES]] presently constitutes the world largest satellite services company in terms of revenue.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Luxembourg}}\n\nTourism is an important component of the national economy, representing about 8.3% of GDP in 2009 and employing some 25,000 people or 11.7% of the working population.<ref>[http://www.station.lu/?p=edito&a=external&id=107145 \"Lux is the place to be for business travellers\"], ''News 352'', 10 February 2011.

It employs about 1\u20133% of the work force. Most farmers are engaged in dairy and meat production. [[Luxembourg wine|Vineyards]] in the Moselle Valley annually produce about 15 million litres of dry white wine, most of which is consumed within Luxembourg and also in Germany, France, and Belgium on a lesser scale.\n\n== Data ==\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.

principles==\nEstablishing accounts depends on the size of companies, and referring to three criteria: total of the balance sheet (total of assets without losses of the accounting year), the net amount of the turnover (net, such as it appears on the profit and loss account) and the average number of the workforce.\n\nThe control of medium and big companies must be made by one or several independent auditors of companies, appointed by the general assembly among the members of the Institute of Independent Auditors of Companies.\nThe control of small companies must be made by an accountant appointed by the general assembly for definite duration.\nThe conclusion of the independent auditor\u2019s report can be:\n* A certificate without reserve, that is to say an approval\n* A certificate with reserves, that is to say that there is approval with reserves because of discords or doubts\n* A refusal to give a certificate\n\nThe accountants'' associations have difficulties getting organized because of the importance of the State in the accounting system.\n\n==Labour relations==\nLabour relations have been peaceful since the 1930s. Most industrial workers are organized by unions linked to one of the major political parties. Representatives of business, unions, and government participate in the conduct of major labour negotiations.\n\nForeign investors often cite Luxembourg's labour relations as a primary reason for locating in the Grand Duchy. Unemployment in 1999 averaged less than 2.8% of the workforce, but reached 4.4% by 2007.\n\n== Energy ==\n{{main|Energy in Luxembourg}}\nIn 1978, Luxembourg tried to build a 1,200 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] nuclear reactor but dropped the plans after threats of major protests.<ref>\"Reactors.\" ''Wise \u2013 Nuclear issues information services.''

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = \n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], United States\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show'' (also known as ''The Island of Sanity'')\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = {{CAN}}\n|prevshow    =Greenline \n|website     = \n|spouse=Deborah Green|awards=}}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[radio personality]], [[journalist]], and [[author]], best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHonours and awards:Moved citation further down sentence.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Green"}

Additionally, he is a bed-and-breakfast proprietor at Schrute Farms, a beet plantation owner, and an owner of the business park in which Dunder Mifflin exists. He is notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense, his love for martial arts and the justice system, and his office rivalry with fellow salesman [[Jim Halpert]]. He is also known for his romantic relationship with [[Angela Martin]], head of the accounting department. He has at times risen to the position of acting Branch Manager of the Scranton branch, but often serves as a second or third in command as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager. While Dwight was regional manager in the last few episodes of the series, he named himself the Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M). Dwight was also the Vice President of Special Projects Development for the Sabre Corporation, which was the parent company of Dunder Mifflin at the time, but was soon replaced by [[Todd Packer]], who was almost immediately terminated. In the final season, Dwight is finally offered the position of permanent Regional Manager.\n\n== Casting ==\n{{further|Rainn Wilson}}\n[[File:Rainn Wilson 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rainn Wilson]] portrays Dwight Schrute]]\n\nDwight Schrute is portrayed by American actor [[Rainn Wilson]]. In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, [[Seth Rogen]] said he auditioned for the role. The character is based on [[Gareth Keenan]] of the [[The Office (UK TV series)|original British version of the show]], who was played by actor [[Mackenzie Crook]].\n\nAll original series characters were adapted for the U.S. version.

Dwight formally held the title of \"Assistant to the Regional Manager\",<ref name=\"pilot\">\"[[Pilot (The Office)|Pilot]]\" because of his admiration for his boss, Michael Scott, ''The Office'' Season One (US/NBC Version), 2005, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> but constantly refers to himself as \"Assistant Regional Manager\", attempting to elevate himself to second-in-command to branch Manager, Michael Scott.  (Michael privately makes him Assistant Manager in \"[[The Fight (The Office)|The Fight]]\", tells him that no record/mention will be kept of the \"title change only\", then never acknowledges it again.)  Dwight craves authority over his co-workers, and relishes any minor task that Michael or anyone else will give him.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> Although Dwight acts superior to many individuals and is often resourceful in crises, he is shown to actually be quite gullible, ignorant, and na\u00efve.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> For this reason, he is easily tricked and pranked by his desk-mate and fellow salesman, Jim Halpert.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.usnews.com/articles/business/careers/2008/03/13/jim-halpert-and-the-first-job-trap.html |title= Jim Halpert and the First-Job Trap |accessdate=2008-07-12 |last= Wolgemuth |first= Liz |coauthors= |date= March 13, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[U.S. News]]}}</ref>\nDwight often speaks in a halting, intense manner, even in casual conversations.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> At the office, his most recurring business wear is a [[mustard (color)|mustard]]-colored, short-sleeved collared [[shirt]], with a dark [[necktie]] and, usually, a brown suit jacket. He often uses [[one-upmanship]] to better himself over his peers, such as boasting about how he trains specific parts of his body. Dwight will sometimes engage in jokes and games in attempts to please Michael, but often fails to do so, because of Michael's perception of himself as the jokester of the workplace. After Dwight temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin, it is shown that he had long been watering the office plant and arranging the toys on Michael's desk in a manner that made Michael happy, unbeknownst to Michael.\n\nDwight is a former [[auxiliary police|volunteer sheriff deputy]],<ref name=\"test\"/> but has to step down after breaking his pledge in order to help his boss, Michael illegally pass a drug test by giving him his pee in the episode \"Drug Testing\". He is also a [[notary public]]; this creates difficulties when Angela desires to send him a notarized letter regarding their break-up. He resides on his family's [[beet]] [[farm]], alongside his [[cousin]], [[List of characters from The Office (US T.V. series)#Mose Schrute|Mose]] (played by producer/writer [[Michael Schur]]). Dwight has affinities for [[paintball]], ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', [[ping pong]], [[survivalism]], [[G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b|Goju Ryu]] karate<ref name=\"fight\">\"[[The Fight (The Office)|The Fight]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> and [[weapon]]s. He also has a preference to ride in the back seat of [[cars]] behind the driver, because it is the safest location in a car. He takes Karate very seriously, gaining a black belt in season 9. He was also \"Senpai\" to the Sensei of the Dojo in which he took part in.  He is also faster than a Black Pepper snake, known as a [[speckled kingsnake]].  \n\nIn \"[[Whistleblower (The Office)|Whistleblower]]\", encouraged to invest in [[real estate]] by former [[CEO]] and owner of Dunder Mifflin-Sabre, [[Jo Bennett]], Dwight decides to purchase the industrial park building. He has shown entrepreneurial traits, like converting the building lobby into a coffee shop in \"[[Nepotism (The Office)|Nepotism]]\", converting an empty room in the office building into a state-of-the-art [[gym]] in \"[[Mrs. California]]\", and organizing a barn maze before [[Halloween]], where kids can pay admission to play, in \"[[WUPHF.com]]\".  He also owns a plot of land on the light side of the moon, given to him by Andy Bernard in season 8.\n\nIn an episode commentary on the [[The Office (U.S. season 1)|season one]] [[DVD]], Wilson refers to Dwight as a \"[[fascist]] [[nerd]]\". In a feature on the [[The Office (U.S. season 3)|season three]] DVD, Wilson describes Dwight as \"someone who does not hate the system, but has a deep and abiding love for it\".<ref name=\"season 3\">\"[[The Office (U.S. season 3)|The Office season three]]\", ([[DVD]]) (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nAll throughout the series Dwight drives a maroon 1987 Pontiac Trans Am, until the finale where he owns an orange 2013 Dodge Challenger SRT.\n\n=== Family and childhood ===\nIn \"[[Lecture Circuit]]\", Dwight claims to remember his own [[birth]], including his father, Dwight Schrute II, delivering him from the [[womb]], and his mother biting off the [[umbilical cord]].<ref name=\"lecture circuit\">\"[[Lecture Circuit]]\", ''The Office'' Season Five (US/NBC Version), 2009, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Grief Counseling (The Office)|Grief Counseling]]\", Dwight states that he was a twin, but he \"resorbed\" his twin while still in his mother's womb (this occurrence is called [[absorbed twin|twin embolization syndrome]]), causing him to believe that he now has \"the strength of a grown man and a little baby\". He also claims to have been born weighing {{convert|13|lb|5|oz|kg|abbr=on}}, rendering his mother incapable of walking for three months and two days,<ref>\"[[Grief Counseling (The Office)|Grief Counseling]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> and in \"[[Baby Shower]]\", he claims to have performed his own [[circumcision]].

In \"[[Dunder Mifflin Infinity]]\", Dwight tells the documentary film crew that his grandfather is (at the time of the episode) 103 years old, and is still \"puttering around down in [[Argentina]]\", implying that his grandfather was one of the members of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Ratlines (World War II)|who fled into South America]].

In the episode \"[[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]]\", he mentioned the movie ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' as being his favorite film. He hints at belief in fictional creatures such as [[Android (robot)|androids]], [[zombies]] and [[vampires]] (though curiously, despite having claimed in \"[[Business School (The Office)|Business School]]\", to have shot a [[werewolf]] (that was actually his neighbor's dog), he says in one of his blog entries that he does not believe in them; however, he may have simply been denying claims of werewolves at Schrute Farms in order to prevent potential visitors from being frightened away).<ref name=\"NBC.com\"/> He enjoys, and is shown to be skilled at, playing [[table tennis]], and states that many of his heroes are table tennis players.<ref name=\"deposition\">\"[[The Deposition (The Office)|The Deposition]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> His musical tastes vary, but [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] seems to be a recurring theme.<ref name=\"traveling\"/> His personal musical talents are not lacking, as he plays [[guitar]] and [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], and sings, as well.<ref name=\"daughter\"/> He has a fascination with cars; he usually checks a car's suspension, especially [[muscle cars]]. He drives a 1987 [[Pontiac Trans Am]] though in the \"[[Finale (The Office)|Finale]]\" he's driving a 2013 [[Dodge Challenger]]. His technological talents are limited, but he shows a passion for the online role playing game ''[[Second Life]]'', in which the only differences between himself and his [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] is that his avatar has the last name 'Shelford' and the ability to [[flight|fly]],<ref name=\"launch\"/> and in [[Spooked (The Office)|\"Spooked\"]], he plays [[StarCraft]] while dressed in a Halloween costume of [[Sarah Kerrigan]]. He also shows an interest in [[trains]], as he is restoring a turn-of-the-century [[steam engine]] in his [[slaughterhouse]], during \"[[The Meeting (The Office)|The Meeting]]\", which has him bonding with [[Toby Flenderson]], as they share the same interest. In \"[[Todd Packer (The Office)|Todd Packer]]\", it is revealed that Dwight does not know who [[Justin Bieber]] is, asking Jim \"Who is Justice Beaver?\", leaving Jim to answer \"A crime-fighting [[beaver]].\"\n\nDwight owns an impressive array of weaponry. In addition to [[Laser Tag]] and [[paintball]] equipment, he has a [[crossbow]] range at his farm (\"[[Office Olympics]]\") and, when he was named official Security Supervisor of the Scranton branch,<ref name=\"test\"/> hinted that he might bring a [[Bo (weapon)|bo staff]] to work. He maintained a hidden arsenal of weapons around the office, including [[pepper spray]], [[Nunchaku|nunchucks]], [[Shuriken|throwing stars]], a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]], a [[boomerang]], [[handcuffs]], a [[Club (weapon)|nightstick]], a pair of [[brass knuckles]] and a [[Jian|Chinese sword]], all of which were confiscated by Toby.<ref name=\"negotiation\">\"[[The Negotiation]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> Dwight also claimed to have sat at his desk for an entire day with a [[spud gun]], without any difficulty from Security.<ref name=\"test\"/> Dwight also uses a real [[gun]], a [[Colt Anaconda]], fired within city limits, to start off the race in \"[[Fun Run]]\".<ref name=\"fun run\">\"[[Fun Run]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Branch Wars]]\", he produces a disturbing number of [[Molotov cocktail]]s for a [[underwear|panty]] raid on [[Utica, New York|Utica]]. In \"[[Survivor Man]]\", it is revealed that Dwight still has numerous [[knives]] (and other weapons) hidden on himself (as in \"[[Stress Relief (The Office)|Stress Relief]]\", there is a knife strapped to his leg) or strategically positioned throughout the office (such as \"Mr. A Knife\" in a filing cabinet, twin sais behind a water cooler, a [[sword]] in a ceiling tile, a [[blowgun|blow dart]] in a bathroom stall, and a [[compound bow]] under a couch), and that he owns a .22 [[rifle]] with [[Telescopic sight|scope]]. Also, in this episode, it is shown that Dwight has extensive knowledge of how to survive in the [[wilderness]], being able to provide himself with food, and, by observing Michael, from a distance, through the scope of his center-fire rifle, he stops Michael from poisoning himself, although it is not clear whether the [[mushrooms]] Michael started to ingest were actually poisonous.<ref name=\"survivor\">\"[[Survivor Man]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version) He also keeps a refle, 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nDwight is vocal about his views on justice, which is reflected in his television viewing habits, as he enjoys watching and has great admiration for [[Judith Sheindlin|Judge Judy]], as well as [[Vic Mackey]] on ''[[The Shield]]''. In \"[[The Negotiation]]\", [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] attacks Jim, because he kissed Roy's [[fiancee]], Pam, but Dwight intercepts the attack with [[pepper spray]].<ref name=\"negotiation\"/> Throughout the episode, Jim attempts to show his appreciation, but Dwight refuses to accept his gifts, simply stating \"[[Citizens]] do not accept prizes for being citizens\".<ref name=\"negotiation\"/> In [[Drug Testing (The Office episode)|\"Drug Testing\"]], Dwight finds half of a [[Cannabis (drug)|joint]] in the parking lot, which incites him to carry out a severe, and thorough, investigation.<ref name=\"test\"/> When he discovers that Michael might have been exposed to illegal drugs at a concert, he substitutes his own [[urine]] during the mandatory drug test.<ref name=\"test\"/> Dwight then resigns from his volunteer position at the Sheriff's Department, because he feels that he is no longer worthy of working there. In \"[[Frame Toby]]\", Dwight states that he is skilled at framing people, as well as [[animals]], revealing that he once framed a [[raccoon]] for opening a [[Christmas]] gift, and a [[bear]] for eating out of the [[garbage]], although he had made it obvious to the [[police]] that he wanted Toby to be imprisoned.<ref name=\"test\"/>  In the episode \"[[Women's Appreciation]]\", he is quoted as saying \"Better a thousand innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.\"\n\nIn \"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]\", Dwight states that he does not like to smile, as showing one's teeth is a submission signal in [[primates]], and that whenever someone smiles at him, \"all [he] sees is a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] begging for its life.\" Dwight owns many exotic pets including [[piranha|piranhas]], [[frogs]], an [[arctic wolf]], a [[raccoon]], a porcupine named Henrietta, and an [[opossum]], although the wolf escaped due to poor restraints and he flushed his piranhas down the toilet. He also has an interest in [[bear]]s, and is ready to debate the habits and characteristics of different species of bears. He also has expressed a surprisingly large affection towards baby otters, as shown in the cold opening of [[Whistleblower (The Office)|\"Whistleblower\"]].\n\nIn \"[[Costume Contest]]\", Dwight claims to be able to sit on a fence, and that he is even able to sleep on one, stating that \"The trick is to do it face down, with the post in your mouth\".\n\nIt is revealed in the \"[[Suit Warehouse]]\" episode that as a child Dwight collected cat feces.\n\n== Relationships ==\nIn \"[[Drug Testing (The Office)|Drug Testing]]\", Dwight states that he likes his co-workers, \"with four exceptions\", leaving it up to the audience to make educated guesses about whom these four exceptions are. The four are most likely [[Jim Halpert]], [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]], [[Meredith Palmer]] and [[Toby Flenderson]], due to Michael's hatred of him. However, it is also probable that [[Phyllis Lapin-Vance]] could be one of the exceptions, as, on many occasions, she and Dwight are shown to have a strained relationship. [[Kelly Kapoor]] is likewise a viable choice as her ditsy nature contrasts Dwight's overly serious character, as we see later in the same episode during Dwight's interrogation of Kelly. This theory is also reinforced by Angela's hatred of Kelly and the influence Angela may hold as Dwight's girlfriend at the time. Pam Beesly is also a possible exception as she is often an accomplice to Jim's pranks against Dwight.\n\n=== Angela Martin ===\nTowards the middle of season 2, Dwight develops a secret relationship with Angela Martin. Pam begins to suspect a relationship between the two, in \"[[E-mail Surveillance]]\", by observing their interactions, suspicions which are strengthened in \"[[The Injury]]\" and \"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]\", and confirmed by \"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesmen]]\", where Angela confides in Pam about her relationship, using code names.<ref name=\"traveling\"/> In \"[[Michael's Birthday]]\", Ryan discovers the relationship between the two when he overhears a coded conversation between them in the kitchen, while in \"The Negotiation\" Jim discovers the relationship while coming out of the office bathroom after quitting time, to find Dwight and Angela kissing (he then tells the documentary crew that, with his silence, the debt he feels to Dwight is repaid).<ref name=\"negotiation\"/>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Fun Run]]\", Angela asks Dwight to care for her sick cat, Sprinkles. Instead of caring for the feline, Dwight feels he should [[Animal euthanasia|kill it as a waste of resources]], and then tells Angela Sprinkles was dead when he arrived.<ref name=\"fun run\"/> When he lets the truth slip out shortly after, Angela terminates their relationship. Jim, on a visit to Dwight's beet farm, finds Dwight sitting alone at night, contemplating Angela's [[cherub]] [[figurine]] and moaning in anguish.<ref name=\"money\"/>\n\nIn the [[The Office (U.S. season 4)|fourth season]] finale \"[[Goodbye, Toby]]\", Dwight is obviously hurt when Angela's boyfriend, Andy, proposes to her. However, in the final scene of the episode, Phyllis catches Dwight [[having sex]] with Angela in the office.<ref name=\"toby\">\"[[Goodbye, Toby]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nIn the [[The Office (U.S. season 5)|fifth season]] premiere, \"[[Weight Loss (The Office)|Weight Loss]]\", Dwight and Angela have resumed a covert relationship, using a storage room in the warehouse to have sex. In \"[[Crime Aid]]\", Andy and Angela set a date for their wedding. After some advice from Phyllis, Dwight gives Angela an ultimatum: call off the engagement, or he will no longer be with her. She chooses to marry Andy. When Andy learns about Angela's affair with Dwight, [[The Duel (The Office)|a duel]] between Dwight and Andy takes place, but both realize that Angela has been lying to them, and break up with her. For quite some time afterwards, Dwight and Angela avoid each other.\n\nIn the [[The Office (U.S. season 6)|season 6]] episode \"[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]\", Dwight, witnessing Jim and Pam talk to customers about their unborn child, decides that he wants a child, and asks Angela to be the mother. They sign an elaborate contract, including eating guidelines for Angela to follow when she is [[pregnant]], and how the baby will be raised. While Angela is excited by the reconciliation, Dwight doesn't share her romantic feelings. When Dwight develops an interest in Pam's friend Isabel, he tells Angela to forget about the contract; this infuriates Angela and she sues him in small-claims court. When an arbitrator tells them that the contract is valid and would involve a $30,000 settlement (because it would be illegal to force Dwight and Angela to procreate), Dwight cuts a deal with Angela for five sessions of sex. He then proceeds to abuse his genitals in an effort to sterilize himself and fends off Angela's efforts to be romantic.\n\nIn [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|Season 7]], after Angela meets a [[state senator]] who she finds much more personable than Dwight, she voids the pact in [[WUPHF.com]].\n\nIn \"[[Jury Duty (The Office)|Jury Duty]]\", it is revealed that, a month before her wedding to the state senator, [[List of characters from The Office (U.S. TV series)#Robert Lipton|Robert Lipton]], Dwight and Angela had sex, as Robert was not fulfilling Angela's sexual needs, so Dwight believes that he is the baby's biological father.<ref>\"[[Jury Duty (The Office)|Jury Duty]]\"</ref> In \"[[New Guys]]\", it is revealed that he is not the father.\n\nIn season 9, they become close again first when Dwight finds out that Robert is cheating on Angela with Oscar, and later in \"[[Moving On (The Office)|Moving On]]\" when Angela helps him take care of his elderly aunt. They share a kiss, but afterwards both say that she should remain faithful to her husband.  After inheriting his aunt's beet farm, Dwight starts a relationship with neighboring [[Brussels sprout]] farmer Esther Bruegger ([[Nora Kirkpatrick]]).  When Dwight seems to be getting serious with Esther and the Senator has publicly dumped Angela, Angela breaks down and admits to [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] that she still loves Dwight.  On the day that he intends to ask Esther to marry him, Dwight instead proposes to Angela.  She says yes, finally admitting that he is the father of her son Phillip. (\"[[A.A.R.M.]]\")\n\n=== Michael Scott===\nDwight holds a high level of respect for Michael, viewing him as a model for success, and often participating with Michael's ill-conceived schemes.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> However, he betrays Michael numerous times, such as when he goes over Michael's head to vie for the manager's job in \"[[The Coup (The Office)|The Coup]]\". Despite this, Michael frequently dismisses Dwight and often appears embarrassed by his antics; for much of the series, he also refuses to promote Dwight from \"Assistant to the Regional Manager\" to \"Assistant Regional Manager\". In later seasons, Dwight was shown to return the favor, such as Dwight telling Michael that he would have a better career if he'd taken a job at Home Depot. Several times throughout the series, however, it is revealed that Michael does care about Dwight's feelings, and the two sometimes share bonding moments. In \"[[Training Day (The Office)|Training Day]]\", Dwight is unhappy when the open branch manager position goes to [[Deangelo Vickers]], and when he learns that Michael did not recommend him for the job, as he led him to believe, he snubs Michael and goes to a meeting Vickers has called, leaving Michael standing outside, by himself. In \"[[Goodbye, Michael]]\", Dwight is still frustrated with Michael, but his hostility turns into heartfelt appreciation as Michael hands him the recommendation letter. At first, the letter does not seem to impress him, but, as he reads through, he realizes that Michael really does respect him. They are later seen engaging in a friendly paintball fight, and Dwight's loyalty to Michael is once again restored. After Michael left, Dwight did not have the same respect for Deangelo and Andy that Dwight previously had for Michael, implying that Dwight truly respects and values Michael. In a deleted scene from \"Finale\", Dwight stated that Michael sent him his \"World's Best Boss\" mug when he became Regional Manager.\n\nIn the episode \"Finale\", as Jim explains that the \"Bestest Mench\" (best man) in Dwight's wedding must be older than him, Dwight is disappointed. The camera then pans over to reveal that Michael returned, much to Dwight's surprise and delight, and Jim has arranged for him to fill in as best man. Michael watches as his \"family\" is sitting together, and is last seen dancing with Dwight.\n\n=== Jim Halpert===\nDwight is frequently the victim of practical jokes by co-workers Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly, including putting his desk supplies in the snack machine, putting his stapler into jello, and moving his desk into the men's restroom, although it appears that he remains oblivious to Pam's involvement; these pranks tend to exploit his stubborn and gullible nature. Dwight's frustration with Jim's pranks reaches a crisis point in \"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]\", when Dwight threatens to quit unless Jim is transferred.<ref name=\"conflict\">\"[[Conflict Resolution]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> Dwight occasionally pulls successful pranks on Jim in turn, most prominently in \"[[Classy Christmas]]\" where he subjects Jim to a barrage of pranks revolving around snowballs. Professionally, Dwight wins the 2005 Salesman of the Year Award, although, this is likely due to, at least in part, his theft of Jim's largest client.<ref name=\"speech\"/>\n\nDuring \"[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]\", Dwight tells Ryan he regrets that he and Jim never got along. In \"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesmen]]\", Dwight quits and hugs Jim as a farewell which surprises Jim as he does not know that Dwight quit. Later, Jim is irritated when Andy replaces Dwight and even says that he misses Dwight. Earlier in the same episode, Jim and Dwight make an incredibly efficient sales team, functioning well as a duo and thinking similarly in their tactics. The two were paired together when they began as traveling salesmen at the company. In \"[[Company Picnic]]\" the two embrace in celebration after Dwight sets Jim up to score the final point in volleyball. Dwight plans to demote Jim from the Assistant Regional Manager spot, and make him miserable, during \"[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]\".<ref name=\"job\">\"[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nDwight's relationship with Jim mellows somewhat in later seasons, and they, at times, cooperate effectively on sales calls or running the office in Michael's absence, sometimes even socializing together. Jim often supports Dwight when he is genuinely hurt or in danger (such as in \"[[Money (The Office)|Money]]\" and \"[[Last Day in Florida]]\") and occasionally compliments his successes (such as in \"[[Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager]]\"). In \"[[The Negotiation]]\", Dwight defends Jim using pepper spray from an incoming attack by [[Roy Anderson (The Office)| Roy Anderson]], and continually refuses Jim's gestures of appreciation, stating that he only acted in the line of duty. However, when Jim is promoted to co-manager, Dwight's enmity returns to full force, and he conducts an ongoing campaign to depose Jim, who eventually resumes his old job as sales representative in \"[[Manager and Salesman]]\".\n\nJim and Dwight team up in \"[[Todd Packer (The Office)|Todd Packer]]\" to remove [[Todd Packer]] after he returns to the Dunder Mifflin offices and takes Dwight's desk. The two at first cannot agree on a plan, but eventually trick Packer into thinking he has got a job offer in Tallahassee.<ref>\"[[Todd Packer (The Office)|Todd Packer]]\"</ref>\n\nDuring \"[[After Hours (The Office)|After Hours]]\", Jim enlists Dwight into trying to get Kathy, an unwanted female suitor, out of his room by tricking Dwight into thinking that he has bedbugs. This prompts Dwight to overreact, first by stripping down to ward off bugs and then spraying Jim's bed with cleaning chemicals. However, the ploy works when Kathy exits the room. Jim and Dwight are then shown sharing ice cream and a friendly smile in Dwight's room, while watching TV on his bed, where it is implied Jim will have to stay the night due to the chemicals in his own room, as earlier Dwight suggested Jim stay with Kathy. In \"[[Last Day in Florida]]\", Robert California confides to Jim that he's going to terminate Dwight's plans to launch the Sabre store, effectively terminating Dwight's job altogether. Jim tries to let Dwight know, who dismisses his warnings as nothing more than just another prank and insults Jim throughout the day, including in front of the other Sabre staff. At Pam's insistence, Jim tries to tell Dwight one more time before he's dismissed, just as Dwight is about to accept what he thinks is his promotion in the board room. However, Jim physically attacks Dwight just before he goes in, and the two had a wrestling match to which Jim finally concedes. When Dwight steps in, he sees that Packer, who has stolen Dwight's promotion in the meantime, takes the fall and is promptly fired by Robert in the meeting. Defeated, Dwight walks out of the boardroom and lends Jim a hand up and returns to Scranton. When Kelly sees Dwight, she mentions that she thought Dwight was staying in Florida, prompting Jim to distract her with a compliment.\n\nDuring season 9's \"[[Dwight Christmas]]\", Dwight is convinced by Jim to hold a traditional Christmas party in the style of his family. Jim must leave before the party is over and Dwight is noticeably emotionally upset when Jim must leave. Later, when Jim returns, Dwight embraces him in a hug. Soon after, in \"[[Suit Warehouse]]\", Dwight absent-mindedly says \"love you\" at the end of a phone conversation with Jim, much to his embarrassment and the bemusement of his coworkers.\n\nIn \"[[Livin' the Dream]]\", the 3rd-to-last episode of the series, Jim suggests to [[David Wallace (The Office)|David Wallace]] that Dwight deserves to replace [[Andy Bernard]] as Regional Manager because Dwight loves paper more than anyone else. David agrees and Dwight is promoted to Regional Manager at the end of the episode as a result; Dwight subsequently appoints Jim to fill his old position, Assistant to the Regional Manager.\n\nIn the final episode of the series, \"[[Finale (The Office)|Finale]]\", Dwight asks Jim to be the best man at his wedding.  Jim throws Dwight a commendable bachelor party rife with surprises (which Jim refers to as \"pranks\").  Before the wedding Jim informs Dwight that, under Schrute tradition, he is not allowed to be best man as he is younger than him.  Jim surprises him with the arrival of [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]]. The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man.  Later in the episode Jim and Pam tell Dwight they are quitting so Jim can rejoin his sports marketing firm now based in Austin, but Dwight fires them instead so he can give them hefty [[severance package]]s Isabel gets PREGO with Dwight and he secretly in love with her not Angela; but he has to leave her.\n\n=== Pam Beesly===\nAlthough she is often involved in Jim's pranks on Dwight, Dwight has, at certain times, displayed a curious sense of protectiveness towards her. In \"[[Back from Vacation]]\" and \"[[Diwali (The Office)|Diwali]]\", he comforts a tearful Pam, and in \"[[China (The Office)|China]]\", he secretly allows Pam to [[Face (sociological concept)|save face]] when she feels vulnerable about her job abilities. In \"[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]\", Dwight offers Pam the position of \"Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager\", and following Jim's advice concerning any offers from Dwight to be involved in something secret, she accepts. Though Jim presumably meant this as the opening move of a prank, Pam instead uses it as a bonding opportunity between her and Dwight.\n\nThe two briefly become best friends while he suffers a [[concussion]] in \"[[The Injury]]\". In the season 6 episode \"[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]\", Dwight shows more signs of his begrudging friendship with Jim and Pam during Pam's pregnancy. In the episode, he is sent to the Helperts' house to retrieve Pam's [[iPod]], while they are at the hospital. Instead of finding the iPod and bringing it back to her, Dwight completely rebuilds and repaints their kitchen, after discovering [[mold]]. He also advises Pam on how to keep her daughter, Cece, from crying, during \"[[Viewing Party]]\", by relating his child rearing experiences. Dwight's odd friendship with Pam is explored again in \"[[Doomsday (The Office)|Doomsday]]\". At this point, Pam is the only one in the office who is able to understand Dwight's inner feelings, as she successfully convinces him to deactivate his doomsday machine. It is implied at the end of the episode that Dwight, despite his outward contempt for his coworkers, feels a sense of responsibility (and possibly even affection) towards them.\n\nIn a talking-head interview, in the episode \"[[Tallahassee (The Office)|Tallahassee]]\", Dwight talks about how first impressions last forever. He recalls that, when he first met Pam, she said something to him that \"slightly rubbed [him] the wrong way\", and while he has since loved working with her, even stating that she is wonderful, due to that first impression, he hates her. In the episode \"The Whale\", Dwight openly tells Pam that he considers her his friend. In the final episode of the series, Dwight refers to Pam as his \"best friend\", and he ensures that she and Jim get a large severance as they leave Dunder Mifflin.\n\n=== Andy Bernard===\nAs a result of the Scranton-Stamford merger, Dwight loses his number two position to Jim and engages in an ongoing battle with new salesman [[Andy Bernard]], to gain Michael's favor for \"third-in-command\". The struggle comes to a climax in \"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesmen]]\".<ref name=\"traveling\"/> In Season 4, Andy and Dwight are shown to work well together as a sales team, but Andy's successful pursuit of Angela, after she broke up with Dwight, was irritating to him. When Andy gets engaged to Angela, Dwight is greatly upset by this, and embarks on an affair with her. This affair culminates in a short-lived fight between Andy and Dwight, when they discover Angela has lied to both of them, about not having had sex with the other. In \"[[Michael Scott Paper Company]],\" they once again find themselves courting the same woman \u2013 [[Erin Hannon]]. However, by the end of the fifth season, Andy and Dwight become friends, and discover they both share a mutual interest in music and hunting.<ref>\"[[Michael Scott Paper Company]]\"</ref>\n\n=== Ryan Howard===\nIn the beginning of the series, Dwight feels threatened by [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]], to whom Michael often assigns personal tasks. He continues to resent Ryan, throughout the second season, often addressing him as \"Temp\",<ref name=\"pilot\"/> even after Ryan took over Jim's position.<ref name=\"dmi\"/> In the beginning of season 2, Dwight's friendship with Michael was slightly torn during \"[[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]]\", when Michael seems to be viewing Ryan more favorably than Dwight, and in \"[[Performance Review]]\", in which Michael must evaluate Ryan.<ref name=\"review\">\"[[Performance Review]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]\", Dwight decides to assist Ryan, during his first sales call, although the two get off to a rough start when Dwight [[Hazing|hazes]] him in a series of bizarre initiation rituals. Soon afterwards, Dwight takes Ryan on his first meeting, which ends in disaster. Ryan then eggs the potential customer's building out of spite, and Dwight develops some respect for him.<ref>\"[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]\"</ref>\n\nDuring season 4, Dwight, along with Michael, comes to Ryan's rescue when they visit him in [[New York City]], when he gets into a scuffle.\n\nRyan and Dwight later team up again in season 6, when Dwight plans to sabotage Jim's occupation, as branch co-manager.<ref>\"[[Scott's Tots]]\"</ref>\n\n=== Romantic relationships ===\nA subtle running joke throughout the series is Dwight's surprising success with attractive women, with Michael often failing to \"hook up\" at the same time. Despite Dwight's unusual appearance and mannerisms, he manages to attract women, who usually develop stronger feelings for him than vice versa. Michael has even pointed out how socially weird Dwight is acting, only for the woman to brush it off. In \"[[Night Out (The Office)|Night Out]]\", Dwight hooks up with a women's [[basketball]] player, while Michael fails in his attempts with other women. As Michael and Dwight leave the club, the woman calls out for Dwight to call her, which he says to Michael that he will not do. In \"[[Niagara (The Office)|Niagara]]\", Michael and Dwight compete for the attention of Pam's best friend, Isabel. When Dwight starts talking about his farm, Michael tries to explain that no one can connect with his experiences as farmer, only for Isabel to become interested in Dwight's [[horse]]s. Dwight ultimately manages to have sex with her, and she begins to develop deeper feelings for him which he does not return, although it is finally hinted in \"[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]\" that Dwight might have more intimate feelings for her than he originally let on. They meet again at the bar in \"[[Happy Hour (The Office)|Happy Hour]]\", and bond further, kissing at the end of the episode. In a chat at OfficeTally.com, [[Mindy Kaling]] noted that Dwight is not a typical \"nerd\" character, that he is a \"farmer and kind of strapping and tall\", and it generally makes sense that he does well with the opposite sex. In season 9, he begins to date an attractive neighboring farmer named Esther ([[Nora Kirkpatrick]]). He ultimately ends his relationship with her in \"[[A.A.R.M.]]\". In the final episode, Dwight marries [[Angela Martin]].\n\n== Character reception ==\nThe Dwight Schrute character has had a very positive reception, and is often cited as one of the most popular characters on the show. According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' he is one of the \"greatest sidekicks.\"<ref>Ben Schott, ''Schott's Miscellany Calendar 2009'' (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008), March 21.</ref> In [[TV Guide]]'s list of the top 100 characters in television history, Dwight was ranked 85th.  In an [[ABC News]] interview with Rainn Wilson, the interviewer commented that \"Words barely describe Dwight Schrute, the suck-up salesman and assistant to the regional manager of the Scranton branch for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company...\"<ref name=\"abc news\">{{cite web |url= http://www.abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3566414&page=1 |title= The Man Behind ''The Office''s' Favorite Suck-Up, Dwight Schrute |accessdate=2008-07-09 |last= Rooney |first= Bryan |coauthors= |date= September 7, 2007 |work= |publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref> and \"Dwight, as played by the 41-year-old Wilson, has become one of the breakout characters in television comedy.

The review stated:\n\"One of the show\u2019s ironies is that Michael and Dwight, hapless though they might be within the office or in most social settings, are actually top salesmen...Undeterred, or unaware of any of this, Dwight carries on with his dreams of grandeur, even instituting a reward system called \"Schrute Bucks\" for employees who please him during a brief but tyrannical reign as branch manager...Dwight approaches sales with the same militaristic fervor as everything else in his life, and it pays off for him (maybe that's one of the reasons why, when Jim gives Dwight one of Benito Mussolini's speeches to deliver when he accepts a sales award in Season Two, Dwight delivers it so enthusiastically that he gets a standing ovation)...\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review//49085/the-office-season-three |title= ''The Office'': Season Three |accessdate=2008-07-09 |last=Gilstrap |first= Andrew |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[PopMatters]]}}</ref> [[Metalcore]] band [[The Devil Wears Prada (band)|The Devil Wears Prada]] named a song \"Assistant to the Regional Manager,\" alluding to Dwight's position.

Following the episode, fans of the show petitioned NBC to make the bobblehead doll available for purchase on their online store.<ref name=\"bobblehead\"/> NBC responded by creating an initial run of 4,000&nbsp;bobblehead dolls, which sold out almost immediately.<ref name=\"bobblehead\"/> The creator of the show, [[Greg Daniels]], joked about the bobbleheads, saying \"Yes, they are fun, but they also serve a business purpose.

They spend the night there, taking part in table-making demonstrations, beet wine-making, and distributing [[manure]]. That night, however, Jim hears an unnerving moaning sound throughout the night, later shown to be Dwight in his room crying over his breakup with Angela. The TripAdvisor page said:\n\n\"Schrute Farms is the number one beet-related [[agritourism]] destination in Northeastern Pennsylvania. We offer the finest accommodations for the casual traveler and/or radish enthusiast. Come join us and experience majestic Schrute Farms.\"<ref name=\"trip\"/>\n\nJim and Pam (\"JandP2\") also posted a review, which can be seen on the reviews page. It read: \"The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your friends. Plenty of parking! The staff's attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers.\"<ref name=\"trip\"/>\n\nAn angry Angela also put a review up, and mentioned the death of her cat as a main cause for the review. It said: \"I have to warn people about the proprietor of Schrute Farms\u2014he may portray himself as a gentleman farmer, but he is not what he seems! He killed my cat, Sprinkles! Who knows what he might do to you or your loved ones...\"<ref name=\"trip\"/>\n\nAccording to Dwight, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], while the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was known for having the most deaths, the battle of Schrute Farms was known for having the highest DPA (deaths per acre).  He also claimed it was the northernmost battle during the Civil War. However, in reality, it was actually a safe haven for men who wanted relief from the war to focus on artistic lifestyles. It is insinuated that this was a camp for homosexual soldiers. Melvin Fifer Garris is the only known soldier to write home from Schrute Farms during the Civil War.\n\nA little known fact is that Dwight Schrute actually won his farm in a game of Blackjack.  This is only shown in a deleted scene from the Season 3 DVD set and some may not consider it canon.\n\n=== Vice presidential bid joke ===\n{{externalvideo\n| align = right\n| width =\n| video1 = [http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/#mea=251910 Rainn Wilson on The Tonight Show discussing the \"nomination\"]\n|\n}}\n\nOn the May 7, 2008, episode of ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', [[US Senator]] and  [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] presidential nominee [[John McCain]] joked that Dwight Schrute would be his vice presidential candidate choice.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/05/new-flash-jon-s.html |title= Sneak Peek: Jon Stewart actually presses John McCain on a topic |accessdate=2008-07-07 |last= Reston |first= Maeve |coauthors= |date= May 7, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=167939&title=john-mccain-pt.-2 |title= John McCain Pt. 2 |date= May 7, 2008 |publisher= [[Comedy Central]] | accessdate= 2008-08-10}}</ref> [[Rainn Wilson]] appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' on May 14, 2008, and read to [[Jay Leno]] a list of demands from Dwight in exchange for being vice president.<ref name=\"vice\">{{cite web |url= http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/#mea=251910 |title= The Office: Dwight Schrute for VP |accessdate=2008-07-12 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[NBC]].com}}</ref> Included in this list was being able to pilot [[Air Force One]] at any time, and only to be addressed as \"Iceman\" while piloting.<ref name=\"vice\"/> He also demanded that [[Jack Bauer]] be immediately promoted to [[United States Secretary of Defense]], his [[bunker]] to include a [[foosball]] table and be [[zombie]]-proof, and that the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] members be armed with [[nunchaku]]s, [[throwing star]]s, and [[flamethrower]]s.<ref name=\"vice\"/> Finally, he demanded a flamethrower, an [[Iron Man]] suit, and that fellow character Michael Scott be an \"ambassador to [[Hawaii]].\"<ref name=\"vice\"/>\n\n===In academic research===\nResearchers at [[Brigham Young University]], [[Stanford]] and [[Northwestern University]] demonstrated that social outsiders, similar to Dwight's character, lead to better group decision making.

Additionally, he is a bed-and-breakfast proprietor at Schrute Farms, a beet plantation owner, and an owner of the business park in which Dunder Mifflin exists. He is notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense, his love for martial arts and the justice system, and his office rivalry with fellow salesman [[Jim Halpert]]. He is also known for his romantic relationship with [[Angela Martin]], head of the accounting department. He has at times risen to the position of acting Branch Manager of the Scranton branch, but often serves as a second or third in command as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager. While Dwight was regional manager in the last few episodes of the series, he named himself the Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M). Dwight was also the Vice President of Special Projects Development for the Sabre Corporation, which was the parent company of Dunder Mifflin at the time, but was soon replaced by [[Todd Packer]], who was almost immediately terminated.

Dwight formally held the title of \"Assistant to the Regional Manager\",<ref name=\"pilot\">\"[[Pilot (The Office)|Pilot]]\" because of his admiration for his boss, Michael Scott, ''The Office'' Season One (US/NBC Version), 2005, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> but constantly refers to himself as \"Assistant Regional Manager\", attempting to elevate himself to second-in-command to branch Manager, Michael Scott.  (Michael privately makes him Assistant Manager in \"[[The Fight (The Office)|The Fight]]\", tells him that no record/mention will be kept of the \"title change only\", then never acknowledges it again.)  Dwight craves authority over his co-workers, and relishes any minor task that Michael or anyone else will give him.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> Although Dwight acts superior to many individuals and is often resourceful in crises, he is shown to actually be quite gullible, ignorant, and na\u00efve.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> For this reason, he is easily tricked and pranked by his desk-mate and fellow salesman, Jim Halpert.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.usnews.com/articles/business/careers/2008/03/13/jim-halpert-and-the-first-job-trap.html |title= Jim Halpert and the First-Job Trap |accessdate=2008-07-12 |last= Wolgemuth |first= Liz |coauthors= |date= March 13, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[U.S. News]]}}</ref>\nDwight often speaks in a halting, intense manner, even in casual conversations.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> At the office, his most recurring business wear is a [[mustard (color)|mustard]]-colored, short-sleeved collared [[shirt]], with a dark [[necktie]] and, usually, a brown suit jacket. He often uses [[one-upmanship]] to better himself over his peers, such as boasting about how he trains specific parts of his body. Dwight will sometimes engage in jokes and games in attempts to please Michael, but often fails to do so, because of Michael's perception of himself as the jokester of the workplace. After Dwight temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin, it is shown that he had long been watering the office plant and arranging the toys on Michael's desk in a manner that made Michael happy, unbeknownst to Michael.\n\nDwight is a former [[auxiliary police|volunteer sheriff deputy]],<ref name=\"test\"/> but has to step down after breaking his pledge in order to help his boss, Michael illegally pass a drug test by giving him his pee in the episode \"Drug Testing\". He is also a [[notary public]]; this creates difficulties when Angela desires to send him a notarized letter regarding their break-up. He resides on his family's [[beet]] [[farm]], alongside his [[cousin]], [[List of characters from The Office (US T.V. series)#Mose Schrute|Mose]] (played by producer/writer [[Michael Schur]]). Dwight has affinities for [[paintball]], ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', [[ping pong]], [[survivalism]], [[G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b|Goju Ryu]] karate<ref name=\"fight\">\"[[The Fight (The Office)|The Fight]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> and [[weapon]]s. He also has a preference to ride in the back seat of [[cars]] behind the driver, because it is the safest location in a car. He takes Karate very seriously, gaining a black belt in season 9. He was also \"Senpai\" to the Sensei of the Dojo in which he took part in.  He is also faster than a Black Pepper snake, known as a [[speckled kingsnake]].  \n\nIn \"[[Whistleblower (The Office)|Whistleblower]]\", encouraged to invest in [[real estate]] by former [[CEO]] and owner of Dunder Mifflin-Sabre, [[Jo Bennett]], Dwight decides to purchase the industrial park building. He has shown entrepreneurial traits, like converting the building lobby into a coffee shop in \"[[Nepotism (The Office)|Nepotism]]\", converting an empty room in the office building into a state-of-the-art [[gym]] in \"[[Mrs. California]]\", and organizing a barn maze before [[Halloween]], where kids can pay admission to play, in \"[[WUPHF.com]]\".  He also owns a plot of land on the light side of the moon, given to him by Andy Bernard in season 8.\n\nIn an episode commentary on the [[The Office (U.S. season 1)|season one]] [[DVD]], Wilson refers to Dwight as a \"[[fascist]] [[nerd]]\". In a feature on the [[The Office (U.S. season 3)|season three]] DVD, Wilson describes Dwight as \"someone who does not hate the system, but has a deep and abiding love for it\".<ref name=\"season 3\">\"[[The Office (U.S. season 3)|The Office season three]]\", ([[DVD]]) (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nAll throughout the series Dwight drives a maroon 1987 Pontiac Trans Am, until the finale where he owns an orange 2013 Dodge Challenger SRT.\n\n=== Family and childhood ===\nIn \"[[Lecture Circuit]]\", Dwight claims to remember his own [[birth]], including his father, Dwight Schrute II, delivering him from the [[womb]], and his mother biting off the [[umbilical cord]].<ref name=\"lecture circuit\">\"[[Lecture Circuit]]\", ''The Office'' Season Five (US/NBC Version), 2009, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Grief Counseling (The Office)|Grief Counseling]]\", Dwight states that he was a twin, but he \"resorbed\" his twin while still in his mother's womb (this occurrence is called [[absorbed twin|twin embolization syndrome]]), causing him to believe that he now has \"the strength of a grown man and a little baby\". He also claims to have been born weighing {{convert|13|lb|5|oz|kg|abbr=on}}, rendering his mother incapable of walking for three months and two days,<ref>\"[[Grief Counseling (The Office)|Grief Counseling]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> and in \"[[Baby Shower]]\", he claims to have performed his own [[circumcision]].

In \"[[Dunder Mifflin Infinity]]\", Dwight tells the documentary film crew that his grandfather is (at the time of the episode) 103 years old, and is still \"puttering around down in [[Argentina]]\", implying that his grandfather was one of the members of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Ratlines (World War II)|who fled into South America]].

It is revealed in \"[[Money (The Office)|Money]]\" that it is a tradition in the Schrute family that when a male has [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] with a woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild [[oats]] that are left on his doorstep by his parents. Dwight also speaks High German, but his knowledge of it is \"pre-industrial and mostly [[religious]]\", as might be expected if the language was learned exclusively in an Amish church or context.\n \nDwight was [[Amish#Shunning|shunned]] by his family from the age of four until his sixth birthday, for forgetting to save the excess oil from a can of [[tuna]].<ref name=\"safety\">\"[[Safety Training]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> He lost a grade school [[spelling bee]] to Raj Patel by misspelling the word \"failure\", in front of the entire school.<ref name=\"speech\">\"[[Dwight's Speech]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In seventh grade, Dwight played the invented role of \"Mutey the Mailman\" in a production of ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' He explains that there were not enough roles for all of the children, so they made up roles.<ref>\"[[The Client (The Office)|The Client]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nDwight lives in a nine-[[bedroom]], one-[[bathroom]] farmhouse (with the single bathroom located under the porch, as revealed in \"[[Office Olympics]]\") on his family's {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[beet]] farm, with his cousin Mose.

In the episode \"[[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]]\", he mentioned the movie ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' as being his favorite film. He hints at belief in fictional creatures such as [[Android (robot)|androids]], [[zombies]] and [[vampires]] (though curiously, despite having claimed in \"[[Business School (The Office)|Business School]]\", to have shot a [[werewolf]] (that was actually his neighbor's dog), he says in one of his blog entries that he does not believe in them; however, he may have simply been denying claims of werewolves at Schrute Farms in order to prevent potential visitors from being frightened away).<ref name=\"NBC.com\"/> He enjoys, and is shown to be skilled at, playing [[table tennis]], and states that many of his heroes are table tennis players.<ref name=\"deposition\">\"[[The Deposition (The Office)|The Deposition]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> His musical tastes vary, but [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] seems to be a recurring theme.<ref name=\"traveling\"/> His personal musical talents are not lacking, as he plays [[guitar]] and [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], and sings, as well.<ref name=\"daughter\"/> He has a fascination with cars; he usually checks a car's suspension, especially [[muscle cars]]. He drives a 1987 [[Pontiac Trans Am]] though in the \"[[Finale (The Office)|Finale]]\" he's driving a 2013 [[Dodge Challenger]]. His technological talents are limited, but he shows a passion for the online role playing game ''[[Second Life]]'', in which the only differences between himself and his [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] is that his avatar has the last name 'Shelford' and the ability to [[flight|fly]],<ref name=\"launch\"/> and in [[Spooked (The Office)|\"Spooked\"]], he plays [[StarCraft]] while dressed in a Halloween costume of [[Sarah Kerrigan]]. He also shows an interest in [[trains]], as he is restoring a turn-of-the-century [[steam engine]] in his [[slaughterhouse]], during \"[[The Meeting (The Office)|The Meeting]]\", which has him bonding with [[Toby Flenderson]], as they share the same interest. In \"[[Todd Packer (The Office)|Todd Packer]]\", it is revealed that Dwight does not know who [[Justin Bieber]] is, asking Jim \"Who is Justice Beaver?\", leaving Jim to answer \"A crime-fighting [[beaver]].\"\n\nDwight owns an impressive array of weaponry. In addition to [[Laser Tag]] and [[paintball]] equipment, he has a [[crossbow]] range at his farm (\"[[Office Olympics]]\") and, when he was named official Security Supervisor of the Scranton branch,<ref name=\"test\"/> hinted that he might bring a [[Bo (weapon)|bo staff]] to work. He maintained a hidden arsenal of weapons around the office, including [[pepper spray]], [[Nunchaku|nunchucks]], [[Shuriken|throwing stars]], a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]], a [[boomerang]], [[handcuffs]], a [[Club (weapon)|nightstick]], a pair of [[brass knuckles]] and a [[Jian|Chinese sword]], all of which were confiscated by Toby.<ref name=\"negotiation\">\"[[The Negotiation]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> Dwight also claimed to have sat at his desk for an entire day with a [[spud gun]], without any difficulty from Security.<ref name=\"test\"/> Dwight also uses a real [[gun]], a [[Colt Anaconda]], fired within city limits, to start off the race in \"[[Fun Run]]\".<ref name=\"fun run\">\"[[Fun Run]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Branch Wars]]\", he produces a disturbing number of [[Molotov cocktail]]s for a [[underwear|panty]] raid on [[Utica, New York|Utica]]. In \"[[Survivor Man]]\", it is revealed that Dwight still has numerous [[knives]] (and other weapons) hidden on himself (as in \"[[Stress Relief (The Office)|Stress Relief]]\", there is a knife strapped to his leg) or strategically positioned throughout the office (such as \"Mr. A Knife\" in a filing cabinet, twin sais behind a water cooler, a [[sword]] in a ceiling tile, a [[blowgun|blow dart]] in a bathroom stall, and a [[compound bow]] under a couch), and that he owns a .22 [[rifle]] with [[Telescopic sight|scope]]. Also, in this episode, it is shown that Dwight has extensive knowledge of how to survive in the [[wilderness]], being able to provide himself with food, and, by observing Michael, from a distance, through the scope of his center-fire rifle, he stops Michael from poisoning himself, although it is not clear whether the [[mushrooms]] Michael started to ingest were actually poisonous.<ref name=\"survivor\">\"[[Survivor Man]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version) He also keeps a refle, 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nDwight is vocal about his views on justice, which is reflected in his television viewing habits, as he enjoys watching and has great admiration for [[Judith Sheindlin|Judge Judy]], as well as [[Vic Mackey]] on ''[[The Shield]]''. In \"[[The Negotiation]]\", [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] attacks Jim, because he kissed Roy's [[fiancee]], Pam, but Dwight intercepts the attack with [[pepper spray]].<ref name=\"negotiation\"/> Throughout the episode, Jim attempts to show his appreciation, but Dwight refuses to accept his gifts, simply stating \"[[Citizens]] do not accept prizes for being citizens\".<ref name=\"negotiation\"/> In [[Drug Testing (The Office episode)|\"Drug Testing\"]], Dwight finds half of a [[Cannabis (drug)|joint]] in the parking lot, which incites him to carry out a severe, and thorough, investigation.<ref name=\"test\"/> When he discovers that Michael might have been exposed to illegal drugs at a concert, he substitutes his own [[urine]] during the mandatory drug test.<ref name=\"test\"/> Dwight then resigns from his volunteer position at the Sheriff's Department, because he feels that he is no longer worthy of working there. In \"[[Frame Toby]]\", Dwight states that he is skilled at framing people, as well as [[animals]], revealing that he once framed a [[raccoon]] for opening a [[Christmas]] gift, and a [[bear]] for eating out of the [[garbage]], although he had made it obvious to the [[police]] that he wanted Toby to be imprisoned.<ref name=\"test\"/>  In the episode \"[[Women's Appreciation]]\", he is quoted as saying \"Better a thousand innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.\"\n\nIn \"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]\", Dwight states that he does not like to smile, as showing one's teeth is a submission signal in [[primates]], and that whenever someone smiles at him, \"all [he] sees is a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] begging for its life.\" Dwight owns many exotic pets including [[piranha|piranhas]], [[frogs]], an [[arctic wolf]], a [[raccoon]], a porcupine named Henrietta, and an [[opossum]], although the wolf escaped due to poor restraints and he flushed his piranhas down the toilet. He also has an interest in [[bear]]s, and is ready to debate the habits and characteristics of different species of bears. He also has expressed a surprisingly large affection towards baby otters, as shown in the cold opening of [[Whistleblower (The Office)|\"Whistleblower\"]].\n\nIn \"[[Costume Contest]]\", Dwight claims to be able to sit on a fence, and that he is even able to sleep on one, stating that \"The trick is to do it face down, with the post in your mouth\".\n\nIt is revealed in the \"[[Suit Warehouse]]\" episode that as a child Dwight collected cat feces.\n\n== Relationships ==\nIn \"[[Drug Testing (The Office)|Drug Testing]]\", Dwight states that he likes his co-workers, \"with four exceptions\", leaving it up to the audience to make educated guesses about whom these four exceptions are. The four are most likely [[Jim Halpert]], [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]], [[Meredith Palmer]] and [[Toby Flenderson]], due to Michael's hatred of him. However, it is also probable that [[Phyllis Lapin-Vance]] could be one of the exceptions, as, on many occasions, she and Dwight are shown to have a strained relationship. [[Kelly Kapoor]] is likewise a viable choice as her ditsy nature contrasts Dwight's overly serious character, as we see later in the same episode during Dwight's interrogation of Kelly. This theory is also reinforced by Angela's hatred of Kelly and the influence Angela may hold as Dwight's girlfriend at the time. Pam Beesly is also a possible exception as she is often an accomplice to Jim's pranks against Dwight.\n\n=== Angela Martin ===\nTowards the middle of season 2, Dwight develops a secret relationship with Angela Martin. Pam begins to suspect a relationship between the two, in \"[[E-mail Surveillance]]\", by observing their interactions, suspicions which are strengthened in \"[[The Injury]]\" and \"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]\", and confirmed by \"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesmen]]\", where Angela confides in Pam about her relationship, using code names.<ref name=\"traveling\"/> In \"[[Michael's Birthday]]\", Ryan discovers the relationship between the two when he overhears a coded conversation between them in the kitchen, while in \"The Negotiation\" Jim discovers the relationship while coming out of the office bathroom after quitting time, to find Dwight and Angela kissing (he then tells the documentary crew that, with his silence, the debt he feels to Dwight is repaid).<ref name=\"negotiation\"/>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Fun Run]]\", Angela asks Dwight to care for her sick cat, Sprinkles. Instead of caring for the feline, Dwight feels he should [[Animal euthanasia|kill it as a waste of resources]], and then tells Angela Sprinkles was dead when he arrived.<ref name=\"fun run\"/> When he lets the truth slip out shortly after, Angela terminates their relationship. Jim, on a visit to Dwight's beet farm, finds Dwight sitting alone at night, contemplating Angela's [[cherub]] [[figurine]] and moaning in anguish.<ref name=\"money\"/>\n\nIn the [[The Office (U.S. season 4)|fourth season]] finale \"[[Goodbye, Toby]]\", Dwight is obviously hurt when Angela's boyfriend, Andy, proposes to her. However, in the final scene of the episode, Phyllis catches Dwight [[having sex]] with Angela in the office.<ref name=\"toby\">\"[[Goodbye, Toby]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nIn the [[The Office (U.S. season 5)|fifth season]] premiere, \"[[Weight Loss (The Office)|Weight Loss]]\", Dwight and Angela have resumed a covert relationship, using a storage room in the warehouse to have sex. In \"[[Crime Aid]]\", Andy and Angela set a date for their wedding. After some advice from Phyllis, Dwight gives Angela an ultimatum: call off the engagement, or he will no longer be with her. She chooses to marry Andy. When Andy learns about Angela's affair with Dwight, [[The Duel (The Office)|a duel]] between Dwight and Andy takes place, but both realize that Angela has been lying to them, and break up with her. For quite some time afterwards, Dwight and Angela avoid each other.\n\nIn the [[The Office (U.S. season 6)|season 6]] episode \"[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]\", Dwight, witnessing Jim and Pam talk to customers about their unborn child, decides that he wants a child, and asks Angela to be the mother. They sign an elaborate contract, including eating guidelines for Angela to follow when she is [[pregnant]], and how the baby will be raised. While Angela is excited by the reconciliation, Dwight doesn't share her romantic feelings. When Dwight develops an interest in Pam's friend Isabel, he tells Angela to forget about the contract; this infuriates Angela and she sues him in small-claims court. When an arbitrator tells them that the contract is valid and would involve a $30,000 settlement (because it would be illegal to force Dwight and Angela to procreate), Dwight cuts a deal with Angela for five sessions of sex. He then proceeds to abuse his genitals in an effort to sterilize himself and fends off Angela's efforts to be romantic.\n\nIn [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|Season 7]], after Angela meets a [[state senator]] who she finds much more personable than Dwight, she voids the pact in [[WUPHF.com]].\n\nIn \"[[Jury Duty (The Office)|Jury Duty]]\", it is revealed that, a month before her wedding to the state senator, [[List of characters from The Office (U.S. TV series)#Robert Lipton|Robert Lipton]], Dwight and Angela had sex, as Robert was not fulfilling Angela's sexual needs, so Dwight believes that he is the baby's biological father.<ref>\"[[Jury Duty (The Office)|Jury Duty]]\"</ref> In \"[[New Guys]]\", it is revealed that he is not the father.\n\nIn season 9, they become close again first when Dwight finds out that Robert is cheating on Angela with Oscar, and later in \"[[Moving On (The Office)|Moving On]]\" when Angela helps him take care of his elderly aunt. They share a kiss, but afterwards both say that she should remain faithful to her husband.  After inheriting his aunt's beet farm, Dwight starts a relationship with neighboring [[Brussels sprout]] farmer Esther Bruegger ([[Nora Kirkpatrick]]).  When Dwight seems to be getting serious with Esther and the Senator has publicly dumped Angela, Angela breaks down and admits to [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] that she still loves Dwight.  On the day that he intends to ask Esther to marry him, Dwight instead proposes to Angela.  She says yes, finally admitting that he is the father of her son Phillip. (\"[[A.A.R.M.]]\")\n\n=== Michael Scott===\nDwight holds a high level of respect for Michael, viewing him as a model for success, and often participating with Michael's ill-conceived schemes.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> However, he betrays Michael numerous times, such as when he goes over Michael's head to vie for the manager's job in \"[[The Coup (The Office)|The Coup]]\". Despite this, Michael frequently dismisses Dwight and often appears embarrassed by his antics; for much of the series, he also refuses to promote Dwight from \"Assistant to the Regional Manager\" to \"Assistant Regional Manager\". In later seasons, Dwight was shown to return the favor, such as Dwight telling Michael that he would have a better career if he'd taken a job at Home Depot. Several times throughout the series, however, it is revealed that Michael does care about Dwight's feelings, and the two sometimes share bonding moments. In \"[[Training Day (The Office)|Training Day]]\", Dwight is unhappy when the open branch manager position goes to [[Deangelo Vickers]], and when he learns that Michael did not recommend him for the job, as he led him to believe, he snubs Michael and goes to a meeting Vickers has called, leaving Michael standing outside, by himself. In \"[[Goodbye, Michael]]\", Dwight is still frustrated with Michael, but his hostility turns into heartfelt appreciation as Michael hands him the recommendation letter. At first, the letter does not seem to impress him, but, as he reads through, he realizes that Michael really does respect him. They are later seen engaging in a friendly paintball fight, and Dwight's loyalty to Michael is once again restored. After Michael left, Dwight did not have the same respect for Deangelo and Andy that Dwight previously had for Michael, implying that Dwight truly respects and values Michael. In a deleted scene from \"Finale\", Dwight stated that Michael sent him his \"World's Best Boss\" mug when he became Regional Manager.\n\nIn the episode \"Finale\", as Jim explains that the \"Bestest Mench\" (best man) in Dwight's wedding must be older than him, Dwight is disappointed. The camera then pans over to reveal that Michael returned, much to Dwight's surprise and delight, and Jim has arranged for him to fill in as best man. Michael watches as his \"family\" is sitting together, and is last seen dancing with Dwight.\n\n=== Jim Halpert===\nDwight is frequently the victim of practical jokes by co-workers Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly, including putting his desk supplies in the snack machine, putting his stapler into jello, and moving his desk into the men's restroom, although it appears that he remains oblivious to Pam's involvement; these pranks tend to exploit his stubborn and gullible nature. Dwight's frustration with Jim's pranks reaches a crisis point in \"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]\", when Dwight threatens to quit unless Jim is transferred.<ref name=\"conflict\">\"[[Conflict Resolution]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> Dwight occasionally pulls successful pranks on Jim in turn, most prominently in \"[[Classy Christmas]]\" where he subjects Jim to a barrage of pranks revolving around snowballs. Professionally, Dwight wins the 2005 Salesman of the Year Award, although, this is likely due to, at least in part, his theft of Jim's largest client.<ref name=\"speech\"/>\n\nDuring \"[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]\", Dwight tells Ryan he regrets that he and Jim never got along. In \"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesmen]]\", Dwight quits and hugs Jim as a farewell which surprises Jim as he does not know that Dwight quit. Later, Jim is irritated when Andy replaces Dwight and even says that he misses Dwight. Earlier in the same episode, Jim and Dwight make an incredibly efficient sales team, functioning well as a duo and thinking similarly in their tactics. The two were paired together when they began as traveling salesmen at the company. In \"[[Company Picnic]]\" the two embrace in celebration after Dwight sets Jim up to score the final point in volleyball. Dwight plans to demote Jim from the Assistant Regional Manager spot, and make him miserable, during \"[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]\".<ref name=\"job\">\"[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nDwight's relationship with Jim mellows somewhat in later seasons, and they, at times, cooperate effectively on sales calls or running the office in Michael's absence, sometimes even socializing together. Jim often supports Dwight when he is genuinely hurt or in danger (such as in \"[[Money (The Office)|Money]]\" and \"[[Last Day in Florida]]\") and occasionally compliments his successes (such as in \"[[Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager]]\"). In \"[[The Negotiation]]\", Dwight defends Jim using pepper spray from an incoming attack by [[Roy Anderson (The Office)| Roy Anderson]], and continually refuses Jim's gestures of appreciation, stating that he only acted in the line of duty. However, when Jim is promoted to co-manager, Dwight's enmity returns to full force, and he conducts an ongoing campaign to depose Jim, who eventually resumes his old job as sales representative in \"[[Manager and Salesman]]\".\n\nJim and Dwight team up in \"[[Todd Packer (The Office)|Todd Packer]]\" to remove [[Todd Packer]] after he returns to the Dunder Mifflin offices and takes Dwight's desk. The two at first cannot agree on a plan, but eventually trick Packer into thinking he has got a job offer in Tallahassee.<ref>\"[[Todd Packer (The Office)|Todd Packer]]\"</ref>\n\nDuring \"[[After Hours (The Office)|After Hours]]\", Jim enlists Dwight into trying to get Kathy, an unwanted female suitor, out of his room by tricking Dwight into thinking that he has bedbugs. This prompts Dwight to overreact, first by stripping down to ward off bugs and then spraying Jim's bed with cleaning chemicals. However, the ploy works when Kathy exits the room. Jim and Dwight are then shown sharing ice cream and a friendly smile in Dwight's room, while watching TV on his bed, where it is implied Jim will have to stay the night due to the chemicals in his own room, as earlier Dwight suggested Jim stay with Kathy. In \"[[Last Day in Florida]]\", Robert California confides to Jim that he's going to terminate Dwight's plans to launch the Sabre store, effectively terminating Dwight's job altogether. Jim tries to let Dwight know, who dismisses his warnings as nothing more than just another prank and insults Jim throughout the day, including in front of the other Sabre staff. At Pam's insistence, Jim tries to tell Dwight one more time before he's dismissed, just as Dwight is about to accept what he thinks is his promotion in the board room. However, Jim physically attacks Dwight just before he goes in, and the two had a wrestling match to which Jim finally concedes. When Dwight steps in, he sees that Packer, who has stolen Dwight's promotion in the meantime, takes the fall and is promptly fired by Robert in the meeting. Defeated, Dwight walks out of the boardroom and lends Jim a hand up and returns to Scranton. When Kelly sees Dwight, she mentions that she thought Dwight was staying in Florida, prompting Jim to distract her with a compliment.\n\nDuring season 9's \"[[Dwight Christmas]]\", Dwight is convinced by Jim to hold a traditional Christmas party in the style of his family. Jim must leave before the party is over and Dwight is noticeably emotionally upset when Jim must leave. Later, when Jim returns, Dwight embraces him in a hug. Soon after, in \"[[Suit Warehouse]]\", Dwight absent-mindedly says \"love you\" at the end of a phone conversation with Jim, much to his embarrassment and the bemusement of his coworkers.\n\nIn \"[[Livin' the Dream]]\", the 3rd-to-last episode of the series, Jim suggests to [[David Wallace (The Office)|David Wallace]] that Dwight deserves to replace [[Andy Bernard]] as Regional Manager because Dwight loves paper more than anyone else. David agrees and Dwight is promoted to Regional Manager at the end of the episode as a result; Dwight subsequently appoints Jim to fill his old position, Assistant to the Regional Manager.\n\nIn the final episode of the series, \"[[Finale (The Office)|Finale]]\", Dwight asks Jim to be the best man at his wedding.  Jim throws Dwight a commendable bachelor party rife with surprises (which Jim refers to as \"pranks\").  Before the wedding Jim informs Dwight that, under Schrute tradition, he is not allowed to be best man as he is younger than him.  Jim surprises him with the arrival of [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]]. The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man.  Later in the episode Jim and Pam tell Dwight they are quitting so Jim can rejoin his sports marketing firm now based in Austin, but Dwight fires them instead so he can give them hefty [[severance package]]s.\n\n=== Pam Beesly===\nAlthough she is often involved in Jim's pranks on Dwight, Dwight has, at certain times, displayed a curious sense of protectiveness towards her. In \"[[Back from Vacation]]\" and \"[[Diwali (The Office)|Diwali]]\", he comforts a tearful Pam, and in \"[[China (The Office)|China]]\", he secretly allows Pam to [[Face (sociological concept)|save face]] when she feels vulnerable about her job abilities. In \"[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]\", Dwight offers Pam the position of \"Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager\", and following Jim's advice concerning any offers from Dwight to be involved in something secret, she accepts. Though Jim presumably meant this as the opening move of a prank, Pam instead uses it as a bonding opportunity between her and Dwight.\n\nThe two briefly become best friends while he suffers a [[concussion]] in \"[[The Injury]]\". In the season 6 episode \"[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]\", Dwight shows more signs of his begrudging friendship with Jim and Pam during Pam's pregnancy. In the episode, he is sent to the Helperts' house to retrieve Pam's [[iPod]], while they are at the hospital. Instead of finding the iPod and bringing it back to her, Dwight completely rebuilds and repaints their kitchen, after discovering [[mold]]. He also advises Pam on how to keep her daughter, Cece, from crying, during \"[[Viewing Party]]\", by relating his child rearing experiences. Dwight's odd friendship with Pam is explored again in \"[[Doomsday (The Office)|Doomsday]]\". At this point, Pam is the only one in the office who is able to understand Dwight's inner feelings, as she successfully convinces him to deactivate his doomsday machine. It is implied at the end of the episode that Dwight, despite his outward contempt for his coworkers, feels a sense of responsibility (and possibly even affection) towards them.\n\nIn a talking-head interview, in the episode \"[[Tallahassee (The Office)|Tallahassee]]\", Dwight talks about how first impressions last forever. He recalls that, when he first met Pam, she said something to him that \"slightly rubbed [him] the wrong way\", and while he has since loved working with her, even stating that she is wonderful, due to that first impression, he hates her. In the episode \"The Whale\", Dwight openly tells Pam that he considers her his friend. In the final episode of the series, Dwight refers to Pam as his \"best friend\", and he ensures that she and Jim get a large severance as they leave Dunder Mifflin.\n\n=== Andy Bernard===\nAs a result of the Scranton-Stamford merger, Dwight loses his number two position to Jim and engages in an ongoing battle with new salesman [[Andy Bernard]], to gain Michael's favor for \"third-in-command\". The struggle comes to a climax in \"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesmen]]\".<ref name=\"traveling\"/> In Season 4, Andy and Dwight are shown to work well together as a sales team, but Andy's successful pursuit of Angela, after she broke up with Dwight, was irritating to him. When Andy gets engaged to Angela, Dwight is greatly upset by this, and embarks on an affair with her. This affair culminates in a short-lived fight between Andy and Dwight, when they discover Angela has lied to both of them, about not having had sex with the other. In \"[[Michael Scott Paper Company]],\" they once again find themselves courting the same woman \u2013 [[Erin Hannon]]. However, by the end of the fifth season, Andy and Dwight become friends, and discover they both share a mutual interest in music and hunting.<ref>\"[[Michael Scott Paper Company]]\"</ref>\n\n=== Ryan Howard===\nIn the beginning of the series, Dwight feels threatened by [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]], to whom Michael often assigns personal tasks. He continues to resent Ryan, throughout the second season, often addressing him as \"Temp\",<ref name=\"pilot\"/> even after Ryan took over Jim's position.<ref name=\"dmi\"/> In the beginning of season 2, Dwight's friendship with Michael was slightly torn during \"[[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]]\", when Michael seems to be viewing Ryan more favorably than Dwight, and in \"[[Performance Review]]\", in which Michael must evaluate Ryan.<ref name=\"review\">\"[[Performance Review]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]\", Dwight decides to assist Ryan, during his first sales call, although the two get off to a rough start when Dwight [[Hazing|hazes]] him in a series of bizarre initiation rituals. Soon afterwards, Dwight takes Ryan on his first meeting, which ends in disaster. Ryan then eggs the potential customer's building out of spite, and Dwight develops some respect for him.<ref>\"[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]\"</ref>\n\nDuring season 4, Dwight, along with Michael, comes to Ryan's rescue when they visit him in [[New York City]], when he gets into a scuffle.\n\nRyan and Dwight later team up again in season 6, when Dwight plans to sabotage Jim's occupation, as branch co-manager.<ref>\"[[Scott's Tots]]\"</ref>\n\n=== Romantic relationships ===\nA subtle running joke throughout the series is Dwight's surprising success with attractive women, with Michael often failing to \"hook up\" at the same time. Despite Dwight's unusual appearance and mannerisms, he manages to attract women, who usually develop stronger feelings for him than vice versa. Michael has even pointed out how socially weird Dwight is acting, only for the woman to brush it off. In \"[[Night Out (The Office)|Night Out]]\", Dwight hooks up with a women's [[basketball]] player, while Michael fails in his attempts with other women. As Michael and Dwight leave the club, the woman calls out for Dwight to call her, which he says to Michael that he will not do. In \"[[Niagara (The Office)|Niagara]]\", Michael and Dwight compete for the attention of Pam's best friend, Isabel. When Dwight starts talking about his farm, Michael tries to explain that no one can connect with his experiences as farmer, only for Isabel to become interested in Dwight's [[horse]]s. Dwight ultimately manages to have sex with her, and she begins to develop deeper feelings for him which he does not return, although it is finally hinted in \"[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]\" that Dwight might have more intimate feelings for her than he originally let on. They meet again at the bar in \"[[Happy Hour (The Office)|Happy Hour]]\", and bond further, kissing at the end of the episode. In a chat at OfficeTally.com, [[Mindy Kaling]] noted that Dwight is not a typical \"nerd\" character, that he is a \"farmer and kind of strapping and tall\", and it generally makes sense that he does well with the opposite sex. In season 9, he begins to date an attractive neighboring farmer named Esther ([[Nora Kirkpatrick]]). He ultimately ends his relationship with her in \"[[A.A.R.M.]]\". In the final episode, Dwight marries [[Angela Martin]].\n\n== Character reception ==\nThe Dwight Schrute character has had a very positive reception, and is often cited as one of the most popular characters on the show. According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' he is one of the \"greatest sidekicks.\"<ref>Ben Schott, ''Schott's Miscellany Calendar 2009'' (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008), March 21.</ref> In [[TV Guide]]'s list of the top 100 characters in television history, Dwight was ranked 85th.  In an [[ABC News]] interview with Rainn Wilson, the interviewer commented that \"Words barely describe Dwight Schrute, the suck-up salesman and assistant to the regional manager of the Scranton branch for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company...\"<ref name=\"abc news\">{{cite web |url= http://www.abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3566414&page=1 |title= The Man Behind ''The Office''s' Favorite Suck-Up, Dwight Schrute |accessdate=2008-07-09 |last= Rooney |first= Bryan |coauthors= |date= September 7, 2007 |work= |publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref> and \"Dwight, as played by the 41-year-old Wilson, has become one of the breakout characters in television comedy.

Oh, only the ten million-plus people who watched as you pepper sprayed the living daylights out of Roy for trying to pop Jim in the face last night. My God, have I missed you, man. Mr. Schrute, you are the reason I love my job, my friend. It is the selflessly heroic actions of a man such as you that make television a nice place to be on a Thursday night. You may just be an everyday citizen who does not accept prizes for being a citizen, but you'd best be accepting a supporting actor Emmy nod this year, because, hot damn if you don't deserve it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eonline.com/print/index.jsp?uuid=062fdae4-4896-4495-aae2-67c952562b8f&contentType=korbisQuickies |title= Fri., 4/6: Dwight Schrute Saves My Thursday |accessdate=2008-07-09 |last= Ghorsh |first= Korbi |coauthors= |date= April 6, 2007 |work= |publisher=[[E!

The review stated:\n\"One of the show\u2019s ironies is that Michael and Dwight, hapless though they might be within the office or in most social settings, are actually top salesmen...Undeterred, or unaware of any of this, Dwight carries on with his dreams of grandeur, even instituting a reward system called \"Schrute Bucks\" for employees who please him during a brief but tyrannical reign as branch manager...Dwight approaches sales with the same militaristic fervor as everything else in his life, and it pays off for him (maybe that's one of the reasons why, when Jim gives Dwight one of Benito Mussolini's speeches to deliver when he accepts a sales award in Season Two, Dwight delivers it so enthusiastically that he gets a standing ovation)...\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review//49085/the-office-season-three |title= ''The Office'': Season Three |accessdate=2008-07-09 |last=Gilstrap |first= Andrew |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[PopMatters]]}}</ref> [[Metalcore]] band [[The Devil Wears Prada (band)|The Devil Wears Prada]] named a song \"Assistant to the Regional Manager,\" alluding to Dwight's position.

Following the episode, fans of the show petitioned NBC to make the bobblehead doll available for purchase on their online store.<ref name=\"bobblehead\"/> NBC responded by creating an initial run of 4,000&nbsp;bobblehead dolls, which sold out almost immediately.<ref name=\"bobblehead\"/> The creator of the show, [[Greg Daniels]], joked about the bobbleheads, saying \"Yes, they are fun, but they also serve a business purpose.

This can be found by searching for Schrute Farms.<ref name=\"trip\">{{cite web |url= http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g52842-d730099-Reviews-Schrute_Farms-Honesdale_Pennsylvania.html |title= Schrute Farms Bed and Breakfast |accessdate=2008-07-07 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[TripAdvisor]]}}</ref> Jim and Pam discover that Dwight is running the Schrute Farm as an \"[[agritourism]]\" bed and breakfast. They spend the night there, taking part in table-making demonstrations, beet wine-making, and distributing [[manure]]. That night, however, Jim hears an unnerving moaning sound throughout the night, later shown to be Dwight in his room crying over his breakup with Angela. The TripAdvisor page said:\n\n\"Schrute Farms is the number one beet-related [[agritourism]] destination in Northeastern Pennsylvania. We offer the finest accommodations for the casual traveler and/or radish enthusiast. Come join us and experience majestic Schrute Farms.\"<ref name=\"trip\"/>\n\nJim and Pam (\"JandP2\") also posted a review, which can be seen on the reviews page. It read: \"The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your friends. Plenty of parking! The staff's attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers.\"<ref name=\"trip\"/>\n\nAn angry Angela also put a review up, and mentioned the death of her cat as a main cause for the review. It said: \"I have to warn people about the proprietor of Schrute Farms\u2014he may portray himself as a gentleman farmer, but he is not what he seems! He killed my cat, Sprinkles! Who knows what he might do to you or your loved ones...\"<ref name=\"trip\"/>\n\nAccording to Dwight, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], while the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was known for having the most deaths, the battle of Schrute Farms was known for having the highest DPA (deaths per acre).  He also claimed it was the northernmost battle during the Civil War. However, in reality, it was actually a safe haven for men who wanted relief from the war to focus on artistic lifestyles. It is insinuated that this was a camp for homosexual soldiers. Melvin Fifer Garris is the only known soldier to write home from Schrute Farms during the Civil War.\n\nA little known fact is that Dwight Schrute actually won his farm in a game of Blackjack.  This is only shown in a deleted scene from the Season 3 DVD set and some may not consider it canon.\n\n=== Vice presidential bid joke ===\n{{externalvideo\n| align = right\n| width =\n| video1 = [http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/#mea=251910 Rainn Wilson on The Tonight Show discussing the \"nomination\"]\n|\n}}\n\nOn the May 7, 2008, episode of ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', [[US Senator]] and  [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] presidential nominee [[John McCain]] joked that Dwight Schrute would be his vice presidential candidate choice.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/05/new-flash-jon-s.html |title= Sneak Peek: Jon Stewart actually presses John McCain on a topic |accessdate=2008-07-07 |last= Reston |first= Maeve |coauthors= |date= May 7, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=167939&title=john-mccain-pt.-2 |title= John McCain Pt. 2 |date= May 7, 2008 |publisher= [[Comedy Central]] | accessdate= 2008-08-10}}</ref> [[Rainn Wilson]] appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' on May 14, 2008, and read to [[Jay Leno]] a list of demands from Dwight in exchange for being vice president.<ref name=\"vice\">{{cite web |url= http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/#mea=251910 |title= The Office: Dwight Schrute for VP |accessdate=2008-07-12 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[NBC]].com}}</ref> Included in this list was being able to pilot [[Air Force One]] at any time, and only to be addressed as \"Iceman\" while piloting.<ref name=\"vice\"/> He also demanded that [[Jack Bauer]] be immediately promoted to [[United States Secretary of Defense]], his [[bunker]] to include a [[foosball]] table and be [[zombie]]-proof, and that the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] members be armed with [[nunchaku]]s, [[throwing star]]s, and [[flamethrower]]s.<ref name=\"vice\"/> Finally, he demanded a flamethrower, an [[Iron Man]] suit, and that fellow character Michael Scott be an \"ambassador to [[Hawaii]].\"<ref name=\"vice\"/>\n\n===In academic research===\nResearchers at [[Brigham Young University]], [[Stanford]] and [[Northwestern University]] demonstrated that social outsiders, similar to Dwight's character, lead to better group decision making.

{"title_page": "Scots property law", "text_new": "{{Scots law}}'''Scots property law''' governs the rules relating to [[property]] found in the legal jurisdiction of [[Scotland]]. As a hybrid legal system with both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] heritage, Scots property law is similar, but not identical, to property law in [[South African property law|South Africa]] and the American state of [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].    \n\nThe term 'property' is wide-ranging but in this article, as in Scots law and many other jurisdictions, it does not solely describe land. Instead, in Scots law, the term 'a person's property' is used when describing objects or 'things' (in Latin: ''rem'') that an individual holds a right of ownership in. It is the rights that an individual holds in a 'thing' that are the subject matter of Scots property law.    \n\nThe terms objects or 'things' is also a wide ranging definition, and is based on Roman law principles.  Objects (or things) can be physical (such as land, a house, a car, a statue or a keyring) or they can also be unseen but still capable of being owned, (eg: a person can have a right to payment under a contract, a person can have a lease in a house, or they may have intellectual property rights in relation to works they have produced). <ref>Badenhorst, PJ, Juanita M. Pienaar, and Hanri Mostert. ''Silberberg and Schoeman's The Law of Property''. 5th Edition. Durban: LexisNexis/Butterworths, 2006, p. 9.</ref> While this may appear to encompass a wide range of 'things', they can be classified and sorted according to a legal system's rules. In Scots property law, all 'things' can be classified according to their nature, discussed below, with four classes of property as a result:     \n\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Corporeal Heritable Property (Land)|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\nEach class of property has rules concerning the rights ''in rem'' (or [[Scots property law#The Recognised Real Rights in Scotland: The Numerus Clausus|real rights]]) an individual may have in that property.     \n\n== Legal Sources of Scots Property Law ==\nPrior to the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England & Wales]] unification as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], Scots Property law was largely governed by [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]] and common law decisions by the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scottish judiciary]]. Its roots predominantly lay in Roman law and the ''[[Jus commune|ius commune]]'', however feudalism was also introduced into Scots property law as a result of the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century so the legal system developed a distinct property law. In the 17th and 18th century, a group of academics, now called the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law, including property law, which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. \n\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]], continued to operate as a separate legal system in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]]. The jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|1801]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999, so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, latterly Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law ==\n\n=== Introduction ===\nIndividuals (both human and [[Legal person|juristic]]) have a patrimony, also known as 'estate', containing all the individual's rights (ie: their legal entitlements) with an economic value (termed ''patrimonial rights'') and all their liabilities.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession'' 2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5. </ref>   This definition is wide ranging so will encompass all the rights, such as the right of ownership or contractual rights, an individual may have. Most individuals will only have one patrimony, but in the case of a [[trustee]], an individual may have two separate patrimonies.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession''2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5.</ref> Patrimonial rights that a person holds in a 'thing' or object are the focus of property law and Scots law distinguishes these 'rights in a 'thing<nowiki>''</nowiki> (in Latin: ''a jus in rem (Lit: a right in a thing)'') from any other rights that an individual may hold.\n\nThe recognised rights ''in rem'' a person can have in Scots law are<ref name=\":1\" />:\n\n* [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|ownership]]\n* [[Lease in Scots Law|Lease]] of heritable property.\n* Right in [[Security in Scots Property Law|Security]]\n* [[Servitudes in Scots law|Servitude]]\n* [[Real burdens in Scots law|Real burdens]]\n* [[Liferent in Scots law|Liferent]]\n\nOwnership is the main real right, with all other real rights subordinate to ownership<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n=== Personal Rights and Real Rights ===\nScots law follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref>\n\n=== Identifying Personal or Real Rights ===\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of an individual committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care). With personal rights, the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') can bring to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> <blockquote>Example 1: A contracts with B to purchase a piece of land. B backs out of the deal but A still wants to buy the land. A has a contractual (personal) right to sue B because they had entered into a contract. A does not have a real right in the thing because no real right had been [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|transferred to him validly]].  A sues B in the Sheriff Court for breach of contract under her personal right.  \n\nExample 2: D is hit by E's car while riding his bike, committing a delict by breaching his duty of care to other road users. D now has a right in delict (a personal right) for E to pay D's damages for his injuries.  D sues E in the Court of Session.  \n\nExample 3: F owns (a real right) a bike. G steals F's bike. F sees G with the bike and wants it back. F, as well as remedies available in [[Scottish criminal law|criminal law]], can raise an action in the courts against G for G's interference with F's right of ownership.  </blockquote>Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>B. Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Roman Law'' (Oxford, 1962), page 101. In Scots law, see Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref> However, any real right an individual may have in property must be <u>recognised and valid</u> in Scots law in order to be a true real right. \n\n=== The Recognised Real Rights in Scotland: The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in an Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is ownership and subordinate to it are the lesser real rights<ref name=\":0\">''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession in Scots property law|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Corporeal Heritable Property (Land)|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n== Other Legal Regimes Relating to Corporeal Heritable Property in Scotland ==\n\n===Feudal law===\n[[Feudalism]] had been the system of land (corporeal heritable property) ownership in Scots law for 800 years from the [[Davidian Revolution]] until the commencement of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BBC News|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|work=BBC News Scotland|access-date=12 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Operation of the Feudal System ====\nThe feudal system operated by vesting the ownership of all land in Scotland in the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: [[List of Scottish monarchs|The King/Queen of Scots]]). The Crown could make feudal grants of land vesting ownership in a Crown vassal. In Scotland, crown vassals could be given \"''the highest and most privileged tenure of land known to the Scottish Feudal System\" ,'' a Barony title, with the ability of the holder to be called a ''[[Baron]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/79RM/pages/76155367/L33+Barony+Titles|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The Crown vassals, could then divide up their land and make further grants of land, such as by a holding called ''feufarm'', to sub-vassals, in a process called ''sub-infeudation. T''hese sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I.

In 1924, a legal commentator noted that Scots property law: <blockquote>\n\"is a law of Roman and feudal origin which has been adapted in the course of eight centuries by legislation and by judicial decisions to the needs of the Scottish people, and during the last century has, little by little, been combining with the English law by a slow operation of fusion.\"<ref>H L\u00e9vy-Ullmann \"The Law of Scotland\" (1925) 37 ''Juridical Review'' 370-91, quoted in Hector MacQueen, \"Private Law, National Identity and the Case of Scotland\" (2012) p 12 </ref></blockquote>\nBy the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of ''dominium utile'' owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (''dominium directum'') in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].''

As a hybrid legal system with both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] heritage, Scots property law is similar, but not identical, to property law in [[South African property law|South Africa]] and the American state of [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].    \n\nThe term 'property' is wide-ranging but in this article, as in Scots law and many other jurisdictions, it does not solely describe land. Instead, in Scots law, the term 'a person's property' is used when describing objects or 'things' (in Latin: ''rem'') that an individual holds a right of ownership in. It is the rights that an individual holds in a 'thing' that are the subject matter of Scots property law.    \n\nThe terms objects or 'things' is also a wide ranging definition, and is based on Roman law principles.  Objects (or things) can be physical (such as land, a house, a car, a statue or a keyring) or they can also be unseen but still capable of being owned, (eg: a person can have a right to payment under a contract, a person can have a lease in a house, or they may have intellectual property rights in relation to works they have produced). <ref>Badenhorst, PJ, Juanita M. Pienaar, and Hanri Mostert. ''Silberberg and Schoeman's The Law of Property''. 5th Edition. Durban: LexisNexis/Butterworths, 2006, p. 9.</ref> While this may appear to encompass a wide range of 'things', they can be classified and sorted according to a legal system's rules. In Scots property law, all 'things' can be classified according to their nature, discussed below, with four classes of property as a result:     \n\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Corporeal Heritable Property (Land)|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\nEach class of property has rules concerning the rights ''in rem'' (or [[Scots property law#The Recognised Real Rights in Scotland: The Numerus Clausus|real rights]]) an individual may have in that property.     \n\n== Legal Sources of Scots Property Law ==\nPrior to the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England & Wales]] unification as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], Scots Property law was largely governed by [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]] and common law decisions by the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scottish judiciary]]. Its roots predominantly lay in Roman law and the ''[[Jus commune|ius commune]]'', however feudalism was also introduced into Scots property law as a result of the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century so the legal system developed a distinct property law. In the 17th and 18th century, a group of academics, now called the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law, including property law, which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. \n\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]], continued to operate as a separate legal system in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]]. The jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|1801]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999, so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, latterly Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law ==\n\n=== Introduction ===\nIndividuals (both human and [[Legal person|juristic]]) have a patrimony, also known as 'estate', containing all the individual's rights (ie: their legal entitlements) with an economic value (termed ''patrimonial rights'') and all their liabilities.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession'' 2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5. </ref>   This definition is wide ranging so will encompass all the rights, such as the right of ownership or contractual rights, an individual may have. Most individuals will only have one patrimony, but in the case of a [[trustee]], an individual may have two separate patrimonies.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession''2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5.</ref> Patrimonial rights that a person holds in a 'thing' or object are the focus of property law and Scots law distinguishes these 'rights in a 'thing<nowiki>''</nowiki> (in Latin: ''a jus in rem (Lit: a right in a thing)'') from any other rights that an individual may hold.\n\nThe recognised rights ''in rem'' a person can have in Scots law are<ref name=\":1\" />:\n\n* [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|ownership]]\n* [[Lease in Scots Law|Lease]] of heritable property.\n* Right in [[Security in Scots Property Law|Security]]\n* [[Servitudes in Scots law|Servitude]]\n* [[Real burdens in Scots law|Real burdens]]\n* [[Liferent in Scots law|Liferent]]\n\nOwnership is the main real right, with all other real rights subordinate to ownership<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n=== Personal Rights and Real Rights ===\nScots law follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref>\n\n=== Identifying Personal or Real Rights ===\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of an individual committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care). With personal rights, the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') can bring to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> <blockquote>Example 1: A contracts with B to purchase a piece of land. B backs out of the deal but A still wants to buy the land. A has a contractual (personal) right to sue B because they had entered into a contract. A does not have a real right in the thing because no real right had been [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|transferred to him validly]].  A sues B in the Sheriff Court for breach of contract under her personal right.  \n\nExample 2: D is hit by E's car while riding his bike, committing a delict by breaching his duty of care to other road users. D now has a right in delict (a personal right) for E to pay D's damages for his injuries.  D sues E in the Court of Session.  \n\nExample 3: F owns (a real right) a bike. G steals F's bike. F sees G with the bike and wants it back. F, as well as remedies available in [[Scottish criminal law|criminal law]], can raise an action in the courts against G for G's interference with F's right of ownership.  </blockquote>Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>B. Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Roman Law'' (Oxford, 1962), page 101. In Scots law, see Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref> However, any real right an individual may have in property must be <u>recognised and valid</u> in Scots law in order to be a true real right. \n\n=== The Recognised Real Rights in Scotland: The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in an Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is ownership and subordinate to it are the lesser real rights<ref name=\":0\">''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession in Scots property law|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Corporeal Heritable Property (Land)|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n== Other Legal Regimes Relating to Corporeal Heritable Property in Scotland ==\n\n===Feudal law===\n[[Feudalism]] had been the system of land (corporeal heritable property) ownership in Scots law for 800 years from the [[Davidian Revolution]] until the commencement of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BBC News|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|work=BBC News Scotland|access-date=12 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Operation of the Feudal System ====\nThe feudal system operated by vesting the ownership of all land in Scotland in the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: [[List of Scottish monarchs|The King/Queen of Scots]]).

T''hese sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I.

The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''[[Dominium directum et utile|dominium directum]]'').

These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n==== Feudal Reform and Abolition ====\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. In 1924, a legal commentator noted that Scots property law: <blockquote>\n\"is a law of Roman and feudal origin which has been adapted in the course of eight centuries by legislation and by judicial decisions to the needs of the Scottish people, and during the last century has, little by little, been combining with the English law by a slow operation of fusion.\"<ref>H L\u00e9vy-Ullmann \"The Law of Scotland\" (1925) 37 ''Juridical Review'' 370-91, quoted in Hector MacQueen, \"Private Law, National Identity and the Case of Scotland\" (2012) p 12 </ref></blockquote>\nBy the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of ''dominium utile'' owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (''dominium directum'') in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].''

He spent the final season of his NHL career with his hometown [[Detroit Red Wings]].\n\nHe is the all-time goal-scoring and points leader amongst American-born players in NHL history. Modano was drafted first overall by the North Stars in [[1988 NHL Entry Draft|1988]], and after the team moved to [[Texas]] he helped the Stars win the [[Stanley Cup]] in 1999. He has been known to state that his favourite city in the world, especially on the road, is Toronto, Canada.

He grew up in [[Highland Township, Oakland County, Michigan|Highland Township]], and due to causing problems at school with his mischievous behavior, a friend of his father suggested to put Modano in a team sport to get him controlled. Michael, Sr. was a fan of hockey, and decided to teach [[ice skating]] to seven-year-old Modano. He learned it well, and six months later was put in local hockey teams. As a youth, he was part of a [[Detroit Red Wings]] team in the 1982 [[Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publicationsports.com/ressources/files/439/Joueurs_Pro.pdf|title=Pee-Wee players who have reached NHL or WHA|year=2018|website=Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref> To spend his [[minor hockey]] career with the Detroit Little Caesar's Triple AAA Hockey Club, the Modano family moved to [[Westland, Michigan|Westland]]. He made the Midget Major team at the age of fourteen when his teammates were two to three years older.

At his very first game, he scored a [[hat trick]], and by his second year, Modano was part of the WHL All-Star Team. Four days before Modano's eighteenth birthday, the [[Minnesota North Stars]] selected him as the first overall draft pick in the [[1988 NHL Entry Draft]]. Modano was the second American to be selected first overall in the draft, after [[Brian Lawton]] in 1983; since then [[Bryan Berard]] (1995), [[Rick DiPietro]] (2000), [[Erik Johnson]] (2006), [[Patrick Kane]] (2007), and [[Auston Matthews]] (2016) have also been taken first overall. Contract problems lead Modano to play one more season with the Raiders.<ref name=lone/>\n\n===Early NHL years: Minnesota North Stars===\nThe North Stars signed Modano on Christmas of 1988, and he joined the team for the [[1989-90 NHL season|1989\u201390 season]]. He scored his first career NHL goal against [[Glenn Healy]] of the [[New York Islanders]], and had a good rookie season which landed him on the [[NHL All-Rookie Team]] and made him a finalist for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]].<ref name=lone/>  He controversially lost to 31-year-old [[Sergei Makarov (ice hockey)|Sergei Makarov]], who had already played professionally in the [[Soviet Championship League]] for over 12 years; this led to an age barrier of 26 for Calder candidates from the following year to the present.\n\nDespite the good start, Modano was often criticized in Minnesota as an underachiever who did not compare to the 1988 number two pick, [[Trevor Linden]]. This was evidenced by a sophomore season where the North Stars reached the [[Stanley Cup Finals]], but Modano barely repeated his goals and assists, while confronting coach [[Bob Gainey]] for his overtly defensive style. In 1992, Modano signed a four-year extension that made him the highest-paid member of the team, receiving $2 million per year. He soon had his best season up to that point, scoring 93 points at the [[1992\u201393 NHL season]] and earning his first [[NHL All-Star Game]] invitation.<ref name=lone/>\n\n===The Stars move to Dallas: Stanley Cup Championship===\nPrior to the [[1993\u201394 NHL season]], the North Stars moved to [[Dallas]] to become the [[Dallas Stars]]. Considering the relocation to [[Texas]] as an opportunity for a fresh start, with different expectations from fans and the media, Modano decided to accept Gainey's suggestions to become a more complete player and perform more attacks. Modano recorded a personal-best 50 goals and again scored 93 points. Soon he became an idol in Dallas, becoming the player who sold the most jerseys and received the most letters. During the next two seasons, Modano lowered his goalscoring and had many injuries - a [[concussion]], a knee injury and ruptured ankle tendons - but improved his defensive play. Despite that, the Stars failed to qualify for the [[1996 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], and Gainey stepped down as head coach, while remaining GM.<ref name=lone/>\n\n[[Ken Hitchcock]] was hired on January 8, 1996 as Dallas' coach, installing a defensive-minded system while requesting Modano to concentrate on his offense and using him more routinely - instead of the 15\u201318 minutes he played under Gainey, Modano routinely played 25 minutes with Hitchcock. Helped by new acquisitions [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] and [[Sergei Zubov]], Modano led the Stars to the [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]] title in the [[1996-97 NHL season]]. In the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs]], with new goaltender [[Ed Belfour]], the Stars reached the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western]] Finals.<ref name=lone/>\n\nIn [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|1999]], Modano won the [[Stanley Cup]] with the Stars, playing all six games of the finals against the [[Buffalo Sabres]] despite breaking his wrist in the second game.<ref name=lone/>  Modano assisted on the Stars' final five goals of the series, including both in Game 5 and Game 6, and final goal.

Modano's career high for points in a game is six (2\u20134\u20136) against the [[Anaheim Ducks]], and he has seven career hat tricks. His only career fight was against [[Rod Brind'Amour]]. He was also a candidate for the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] (2001), and the [[Lady Byng Trophy]] (2003).\n\n===2005\u20132010===\nAs the long-time face of the Dallas franchise, he has recorded over 1,000 NHL points and became the captain of the Stars in 2003. During the 2005 offseason, Modano contemplated signing with the [[Boston Bruins]], but he decided to stay with the Stars after owner [[Tom Hicks]] got involved. Modano would sign a five-year contract extension with Dallas on August 5, 2005. On September 29, 2006, [[Brenden Morrow]] replaced him as the Stars' [[captain (ice hockey)|captain]]; Modano served an alternate captain from that time until 2010, a role in which he had previously served from 1995 to 2003.\n\nModano scored his 500th career regular-season goal on March 13, 2007, with 10:24 left in the 3rd period in a regulation win against [[Antero Niittym\u00e4ki]] of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] with assists by [[Antti Miettinen]] and [[Jon Klemm]]. He is only the 14th goal scorer to score 500 goals with a single team and the 39th player to reach 500 goals overall.\n[[Image:Modano Record Goal.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Modano's shorthanded, record breaking goal, November 7, 2007]]\n\nOn March 17, 2007, in an away game versus the [[Nashville Predators]], Modano scored his 502nd and 503rd career regular-season goals in a 3\u20132 loss, thus passing [[Joe Mullen]]'s NHL record (502) for most goals scored by an American-born player.\n\nModano also holds the NHL all-time record for most points scored by a U.S. born player. He broke the record, which previously belonged to [[Phil Housley]], on November 7, 2007, by scoring two goals in the first five minutes, with the record-breaker being a short-handed goal on a breakaway, against the [[San Jose Sharks]]. That night, amongst his congratulatory phone calls was one from [[Air Force One]], U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] spoke to him for a few minutes about the record.\n\nNovember 21, 2007, was \"Mike Modano Tribute Night\" at [[American Airlines Center]], where Modano was honored by the franchise for his achievements in U.S. hockey. Those who spoke in the pre-game ceremony included [[Brett Hull]], [[Joe Mullen]], [[Phil Housley]], and Stars owner [[Tom Hicks]]. Capping off an emotional night, Modano later went on to score the game-tying goal, as well as a shootout goal in a 3\u20132 Stars victory against the [[Anaheim Ducks]].\n\nWith his production declining from 2007\u20132010, Modano played out the duration of his contract, which expired after the 2009\u201310 season.

He spent the final season of his NHL career with his hometown [[Detroit Red Wings]].\n\nHe is the all-time goal-scoring and points leader amongst American-born players in NHL history. Modano was drafted first overall by the North Stars in [[1988 NHL Entry Draft|1988]], and after the team moved to [[Texas]] he helped the Stars win the [[Stanley Cup]] in 1999.\n\nModano is considered one of the most influential figures in popularizing hockey in Texas and the [[southern United States]].<ref>[http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/4893/mike-modano-says-goodbye Mike Modano Says Goodbye], [[Grantland]]</ref> Modano was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] on November 17, 2014.<ref>[http://redwings.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=723528 Hasek, Modano in Hall's Class of 2014]</ref> In 2017, he was named one of the [[100 Greatest NHL Players]].<ref>{{cite web| last1=Allen| first1=Kevin| title=Mike Modano: 100 Greatest NHL Players| url=https://www.nhl.com/news/mike-modano-100-greatest-nhl-hockey-players/c-285495020| website=NHL.com| accessdate=May 15, 2017| date=January 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nModano was born in [[Livonia, Michigan]], the third child and only son of Michael, Sr. and Karen Modano. He grew up in [[Highland Township, Oakland County, Michigan|Highland Township]], and due to causing problems at school with his mischievous behavior, a friend of his father suggested to put Modano in a team sport to get him controlled. Michael, Sr. was a fan of hockey, and decided to teach [[ice skating]] to seven-year-old Modano. He learned it well, and six months later was put in local hockey teams. As a youth, he was part of a [[Detroit Red Wings]] team in the 1982 [[Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publicationsports.com/ressources/files/439/Joueurs_Pro.pdf|title=Pee-Wee players who have reached NHL or WHA|year=2018|website=Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref> To spend his [[minor hockey]] career with the Detroit Little Caesar's Triple AAA Hockey Club, the Modano family moved to [[Westland, Michigan|Westland]]. He made the Midget Major team at the age of fourteen when his teammates were two to three years older. In the 1984\u201385 season, Modano scored 50 goals and 50 assists on the way to win the [[USA Hockey]] National Championship in 1985.<ref name=lone/><ref name=lc>{{cite web|url=http://dlchc.goalline.ca/news.php?news_id=282984&lang= |title=Detroit Little Caesars AAA Hockey Club powered by GOALLINE.ca |publisher=Dlchc.goalline.ca |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> As a child Modano decided to pick the number 9 for his jersey in an homage to both [[Ted Williams]], an idol of his [[Boston Red Sox]] fan father, and the Red Wings' own [[Gordie Howe]].<ref>http://stars.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=708404&navid=DL|DAL|home</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Minor leagues===\nIn 1986, 16-year-old Modano was invited by coach [[Rick Wilson (ice hockey)|Rick Wilson]] of the [[Prince Albert Raiders]] to come to [[Saskatchewan]] and join the [[Western Hockey League]] team. At his very first game, he scored a [[hat trick]], and by his second year, Modano was part of the WHL All-Star Team. Four days before Modano's eighteenth birthday, the [[Minnesota North Stars]] selected him as the first overall draft pick in the [[1988 NHL Entry Draft]]. Modano was the second American to be selected first overall in the draft, after [[Brian Lawton]] in 1983; since then [[Bryan Berard]] (1995), [[Rick DiPietro]] (2000), [[Erik Johnson]] (2006), [[Patrick Kane]] (2007), and [[Auston Matthews]] (2016) have also been taken first overall. Contract problems lead Modano to play one more season with the Raiders.<ref name=lone/>\n\n===Early NHL years: Minnesota North Stars===\nThe North Stars signed Modano on Christmas of 1988, and he joined the team for the [[1989-90 NHL season|1989\u201390 season]]. He scored his first career NHL goal against [[Glenn Healy]] of the [[New York Islanders]], and had a good rookie season which landed him on the [[NHL All-Rookie Team]] and made him a finalist for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]].<ref name=lone/>  He controversially lost to 31-year-old [[Sergei Makarov (ice hockey)|Sergei Makarov]], who had already played professionally in the [[Soviet Championship League]] for over 12 years; this led to an age barrier of 26 for Calder candidates from the following year to the present.\n\nDespite the good start, Modano was often criticized in Minnesota as an underachiever who did not compare to the 1988 number two pick, [[Trevor Linden]]. This was evidenced by a sophomore season where the North Stars reached the [[Stanley Cup Finals]], but Modano barely repeated his goals and assists, while confronting coach [[Bob Gainey]] for his overtly defensive style. In 1992, Modano signed a four-year extension that made him the highest-paid member of the team, receiving $2 million per year. He soon had his best season up to that point, scoring 93 points at the [[1992\u201393 NHL season]] and earning his first [[NHL All-Star Game]] invitation.<ref name=lone/>\n\n===The Stars move to Dallas: Stanley Cup Championship===\nPrior to the [[1993\u201394 NHL season]], the North Stars moved to [[Dallas]] to become the [[Dallas Stars]]. Considering the relocation to [[Texas]] as an opportunity for a fresh start, with different expectations from fans and the media, Modano decided to accept Gainey's suggestions to become a more complete player and perform more attacks. Modano recorded a personal-best 50 goals and again scored 93 points. Soon he became an idol in Dallas, becoming the player who sold the most jerseys and received the most letters. During the next two seasons, Modano lowered his goalscoring and had many injuries - a [[concussion]], a knee injury and ruptured ankle tendons - but improved his defensive play. Despite that, the Stars failed to qualify for the [[1996 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], and Gainey stepped down as head coach, while remaining GM.<ref name=lone/>\n\n[[Ken Hitchcock]] was hired on January 8, 1996 as Dallas' coach, installing a defensive-minded system while requesting Modano to concentrate on his offense and using him more routinely - instead of the 15\u201318 minutes he played under Gainey, Modano routinely played 25 minutes with Hitchcock. Helped by new acquisitions [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] and [[Sergei Zubov]], Modano led the Stars to the [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]] title in the [[1996-97 NHL season]]. In the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs]], with new goaltender [[Ed Belfour]], the Stars reached the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western]] Finals.<ref name=lone/>\n\nIn [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|1999]], Modano won the [[Stanley Cup]] with the Stars, playing all six games of the finals against the [[Buffalo Sabres]] despite breaking his wrist in the second game.<ref name=lone/>  Modano assisted on the Stars' final five goals of the series, including both in Game 5 and Game 6, and final goal. Led the Stars with 23 points in the playoffs, with all seven in the finals on assists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/1999/playoffs/news/1999/06/19/stanleycup_final/index.html |title=CNN/SI - 1999 NHL Playoffs - - Sunday June 20, 1999 09:57 AM |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1999-06-20 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> The Stars returned to the finals in [[2000 Stanley Cup Finals|2000]] against the [[New Jersey Devils]].

Modano's career high for points in a game is six (2\u20134\u20136) against the [[Anaheim Ducks]], and he has seven career hat tricks. His only career fight was against [[Rod Brind'Amour]]. He was also a candidate for the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] (2001), and the [[Lady Byng Trophy]] (2003).\n\n===2005\u20132010===\nAs the long-time face of the Dallas franchise, he has recorded over 1,000 NHL points and became the captain of the Stars in 2003. During the 2005 offseason, Modano contemplated signing with the [[Boston Bruins]], but he decided to stay with the Stars after owner [[Tom Hicks]] got involved. Modano would sign a five-year contract extension with Dallas on August 5, 2005. On September 29, 2006, [[Brenden Morrow]] replaced him as the Stars' [[captain (ice hockey)|captain]]; Modano served an alternate captain from that time until 2010, a role in which he had previously served from 1995 to 2003.\n\nModano scored his 500th career regular-season goal on March 13, 2007, with 10:24 left in the 3rd period in a regulation win against [[Antero Niittym\u00e4ki]] of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] with assists by [[Antti Miettinen]] and [[Jon Klemm]]. He is only the 14th goal scorer to score 500 goals with a single team and the 39th player to reach 500 goals overall.\n[[Image:Modano Record Goal.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Modano's shorthanded, record breaking goal, November 7, 2007]]\n\nOn March 17, 2007, in an away game versus the [[Nashville Predators]], Modano scored his 502nd and 503rd career regular-season goals in a 3\u20132 loss, thus passing [[Joe Mullen]]'s NHL record (502) for most goals scored by an American-born player.\n\nModano also holds the NHL all-time record for most points scored by a U.S. born player. He broke the record, which previously belonged to [[Phil Housley]], on November 7, 2007, by scoring two goals in the first five minutes, with the record-breaker being a short-handed goal on a breakaway, against the [[San Jose Sharks]]. That night, amongst his congratulatory phone calls was one from [[Air Force One]], U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] spoke to him for a few minutes about the record.\n\nNovember 21, 2007, was \"Mike Modano Tribute Night\" at [[American Airlines Center]], where Modano was honored by the franchise for his achievements in U.S. hockey. Those who spoke in the pre-game ceremony included [[Brett Hull]], [[Joe Mullen]], [[Phil Housley]], and Stars owner [[Tom Hicks]]. Capping off an emotional night, Modano later went on to score the game-tying goal, as well as a shootout goal in a 3\u20132 Stars victory against the [[Anaheim Ducks]].\n\nWith his production declining from 2007\u20132010, Modano played out the duration of his contract, which expired after the 2009\u201310 season.

[[Napoleon III of France]] wanted to establish a monarchist ally in the Americas as a restraint upon the growing power of the [[United States]] <ref>{{cite book |last=Guedalla|first=Philip |date=1923|title=The Second Empire |location= |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |page=322 |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>. Chosen as the Mexican emperor was Austrian Archduke [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Ferdinand Maximilian]], of the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]].\n\nPromoted by the powerful and conservative elite of Mexico's \"[[Hacienda|hacendado]]s\", with the support of the French, as well as from the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Belgian monarchy|Belgian]] crowns, the intervention attempted to create a monarchical system in Mexico, as it had functioned during the 300 years of the viceroyalty of [[New Spain]] and for the short term of the imperial independent reign of Emperor [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide|Agust\u00edn I]] of Mexico. The French attempt to establish a monarchy however triggered a civil war in Mexico, with the imperialists ultimately losing soon after the French troops withdrew from the country. The Empire came to an end on June 19, 1867, with the execution of Emperor Maximilian I by the government of the restored Mexican Republic. \n\n==History==\n{{Main|Second French intervention in Mexico}}\n\n===Mexican Monarchism===\nMexican monarchism emerged in conjunction with the struggle for independence. After [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded Spain, the initial independence movements throughout Latin America concerned themselves with supporting the deposed [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] as the legitimate king as opposed to [[Joseph Bonaparte]] who had been established as king of Spain by Napoleon. During the [[Cry of Dolores|Grito de Dolores]], Miguel Hidalgo Costilla rallied his listeners to support Ferdinand VII against the [[New Spain|New Spanish]] ruling classes that were allegedly going to betray Mexico and Catholicism over to the French. \n<ref>{{cite book |last=Fehrenbach|first=T.R. |date=1995|title=Fire and Blood: A History of Mexico |url=https://archive.org/details/firebloodhistory00fehr_0|url-access=registration|location= |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/firebloodhistory00fehr_0/page/320 320] |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nWhile his insurrection was unsuccessful the ultimate triumphant movement for Mexican independence was led by Agustin de Iturbide with his [[Plan of Iguala]], which made specific admission for a European monarch to be placed on the Mexican throne. After the offer was refused Iturbide himself assumed the throne in a barracks revolt, which was nonetheless confirmed by the Mexican congress.\n\nIturbide in his attempts to govern became increasingly autocratic, losing support of congress, and shutting the legislature down, discrediting monarchy even amongst conservatives, but the idea did not go away.

Prior to 1861 any interference in the affairs of Mexico by European powers would have been viewed in the U.S as a challenge to the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. In 1861 however, the U.S. was embroiled in its own conflict, the [[American Civil War]], which made the U.S. government powerless to intervene. When on July, 1861 Mexican President [[Benito Juarez]] declared a two-year moratorium on Mexican debt to France among other nations, Napoleon finally had a pretext. Encouraged by Empress Eugenie, who saw herself as the champion of the Catholic Church in Mexico, Napoleon III took advantage of the situation.\n\n[[File:Dell'Acqua Ernennung Maximilians zum Kaiser Mexikos.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Offering of the Mexican Crown by a Mexican delegation, [[Miramare Castle]], 1863.]]\n\nNapoleon III saw the opportunity to make France the great modernizing influence in the Western Hemisphere, as well as enabling the country to capture the [[South American]] markets. To give him further encouragement, there was his half brother, the [[Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny|duc de Morny]], who was the largest holder of [[Mexico|Mexican]] bonds.\n\nFrench troops landed in December, 1861, and began military operations on April, 1862.

The capital was taken by June, 1863 and the French now sought to establish a friendly Mexican government.

Maximilian formally accepted the crown on April 10, 1864, and set sail for Mexico, arriving in [[Veracruz]] on May 28 and reaching the capital on June 12.\n\n===Maximilian's Reign=== \nOn his arrival in the summer of 1864 Maximilian declared a political amnesty for all liberals who wished to join the Empire, and his conciliation efforts eventually won over moderate liberals such as [[Jos\u00e9 Fernando Ram\u00edrez]] and [[Santiago Vidaurri]] <ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft|first=Hubert Howe |date=1888|title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887|location= |publisher=The Bancroft Company |pages=150}}</ref>.

While French troops controlled major cities, guerillas continued to be a major military threat in the countryside. In an effort to combat the increasing violence and in a belief that Juarez was outside of the nation already, Maximilian in October signed a decree authorizing the court martial and execution of anyone found either aiding or participating with the guerillas. The harsh measure was hardly unprecedented in Mexican history even resembling an 1862 measure by Juarez, but it proved to be widely reviled, being branded the Black Decree, and contributing to the growing unpopularity of the Empire <ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft|first=Hubert Howe |date=1888|title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887 ||location= |publisher=The Bancroft Company |pages=183-184}}</ref>.\n\n===Fall of the Empire===\n\nIn January 1866, seeing the war as unwinnable Napoleon declared to the French Chambers that he intended to withdraw the French military from Mexico. Maximilian's request for more aid or at least a delay in troop withdrawals was denied. Carlota arrived in Europe in an attempt to plead for the Empire's cause, but was unable to gain more support. The failure of her mission apparently caused her to go insane. \n\nIn October Maximilian moved his cabinet to [[Orizaba]] and was widely rumored to be leaving the nation. He contemplated abdication, and on November 25 held a council of his ministers to address the crisis faced by the Empire. They narrowly voted against abdication and Maximilian headed back towards the capital. <ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft|first=Hubert Howe |date=1888|title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887|location= |publisher=The Bancroft Company |pages=241}}</ref> He intended to appeal to the nation in order to hold a national assembly which would then decide what form of government the Mexican nation was to take. Such a measure however would require a ceasefire from Juarez who had no such intention of conceding to what he viewed as a usurper. \n\nAs the national assembly project fell through Maximilian decided to focus on military operations and in February as the last of the French troops were leaving, the Emperor headed for the city of [[Quer\u00e9taro City|Queretaro]] to join the bulk of his loyal Mexican troops, numbering about 10,000 men. The liberal generals [[Mariano Escobedo|Escobedo]] and [[Ram\u00f3n Corona|Corona]] converged on Queretaro with 40,000 men and yet the city held out until being betrayed by an imperial officer who opened the gates to the liberals on May 15. <ref>{{cite book |last=Fehrenbach|first=T.R. |date=1995|title=Fire and Blood: A History of Mexico |url= |location= |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=438 }}</ref>\n\nMaximilian was captured and placed on trial with his leading generals [[Tom\u00e1s Mej\u00eda Camacho|Mej\u00eda]] and [[Miguel Miram\u00f3n|Miramon]].

The main goal was connecting the port of Veracruz and the capital in Mexico City. In 1857, Don Antonio Escand\u00f3n secured the right to build a line from the port of Veracruz to Mexico City and on to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Revolution and political instability stifled progress on the financing or construction of the line until 1864, when, under the regime of [[Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]], the Imperial Mexican Railway Company began construction of the line. Political upheaval continued to stifle progress, and the initial segment from Veracruz to Mexico City was inaugurated nine years later on January 1, 1873 by President [[Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada]].\n\n[[File:21Puente_de_Wimer-Cumbre_de_Maltrata.png|thumb|right|250px|Mexican Railway, Bridge by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco G\u00f3mez]] 1877.]]\n\nIn 1857 the original proprietors of the government concession, the Masso Brothers, inaugurated on the 4th of July the train service from Tlatelolco, in M\u00e9xico City, to the nearby town of [[Villa de Guadalupe, Mexico City|Guadalupe Hidalgo]].<ref>[http://www.fotolog.com/ahuicyani/77908717/ Ferrocarril de M\u00e9xico a La Villa]</ref> Eventually they ran out of funds and decided to sell it to Manuel Escand\u00f3n and Antonio Escand\u00f3n.<ref>[https://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/ferrocarril-ruta-vital.html La historia del tren en M\u00e9xico]</ref> The Escand\u00f3n Brothers continued working and the project, and Antonio Escand\u00f3n visited the United States and England in the last months of the year. In the first country, he hired Andrew Talcott, and in the latter, he sold company stock. Exploration of a route from Orizaba to Maltrata was performed by engineers Andrew H. Talcott and Pascual Almaz\u00e1n.\n\n[[File:14Orizaba_desde_el_Puente_de_Paso_del_Toro.png|thumb|left|250px|Mexican Railway, Bridge by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco G\u00f3mez]] 1877.]]\n[[File:Jos\u00e9_Mar\u00eda_Velasco_-_The_Metlac_Ravine_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco - The Metlac Ravine.]]\n\nDuring the French intervention, part of the railways were destroyed. The only option available was the establishment of a pact between the French Army, and the two companies of the Escand\u00f3n Brothers. The French Army was to provide a subsidy to the companies of 120 000 francs a month for the works, and the companies were to establish service from Veracruz to Soledad para by May, actually concluding on August 15, 1862, concluding 41 kilometres of tracks.

An immigration agency was set up to promote immigration from the United States, the Confederate States, Germany, and Asia. Colonists were to be granted citizenship at once, and gained exemption from taxes for the first year, and an exemption from military services for five years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft |first=Hubert Howe |date=1887 |title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887|location=San Francisco |publisher=The History Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/worksofhuberthow14bancrich/page/174 174]|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofhuberthow14bancrich}}</ref>\n\nSome of the most prominent colonization settlements were the [[Villa Carlota, Mexico|Villa Carlota]] and the [[New Virginia Colony]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Castillo_de_Chapultepec_(Museo_Nacional_de_Historia).JPG|thumb|left|300px|[[Chapultepec Castle]]]]\nIn spite of lasting in power only a few years, Maximilian managed to leave behind constructions that remain prominent even in present-day Mexico City.\n\nFor his royal residence, Maximilian decided to renovate a former viceregal villa in Mexico City, which was also notable for being the site of a battle during the U.S. invasion of Mexico. The result would be Chapultepec Castle, the only castle in North America ever to be used by actual royalty. While formerly serving as the official home of Mexican presidents, today the site is a museum.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chapultepec-castle|title=Chapultepec Castle: The only castle in North America to ever house actual sovereigns.}}</ref>\n\nIn order to connect the palace to the government offices in Mexico city, Maximilian also built a prominent road which he called Paseo de la Emperatriz (''The Empress' Promenade'').  After the fall of the Empire, the government renamed it Paseo de la Reforma (''Promenade of the Reform'') to commemorate President Juarez and the reforms that he helped to legislate. In the present, it continues to be one of the most prominent avenues of the capital and is lined with civic monuments.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mexperience.com/paseo-de-la-reforma/|title=Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City}}</ref>\n\nToday, the Second Mexican Empire is advocated by small far-right groups like the [[Nationalist Front of Mexico]], whose followers believe the Empire to have been a legitimate attempt to deliver Mexico from the hegemony of the [[United States]]. They are reported to gather every year at Quer\u00e9taro, the place where Maximilian and his generals were executed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nacionalistas.org/2012/06/homenaje-los-martires-del-segundo.html |title=Homage to the Martyrs of the Second Mexican Empire |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503115911/http://www.nacionalistas.org/2012/06/homenaje-los-martires-del-segundo.html |archivedate=3 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{History of Mexico |1864-1928}}\n\nThe 1970 film ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' was set in Mexico during the years of the Second Mexican Empire. The two main characters, played by [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]], aided a Mexican resistance force and ultimately led them to overpower a French garrison.\n\nThe 1969 film ''[[The Undefeated (1969 film)|The Undefeated]]'' starring [[John Wayne]] and [[Rock Hudson]] portrays events during the French Intervention in Mexico and was also loosely based on the escape of [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General]] [[Sterling Price]] to Mexico after the [[American Civil War]] and his attempt to join with Maximilian's forces.\n\nThe 1965 film ''[[Major Dundee]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Richard Harris]] featured [[Union Army|Union]] cavalry (supplemented by [[Galvanized Yankees]]) crossing into Mexico and fighting French forces towards the end of the American Civil War.\n\nThe 1954 film ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'' was also set in Mexico and has an appearance of Maximilian having a target shooting competition with [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Burt Lancaster]]'s character at [[Chapultepec Castle]]. Maximilian was played by [[George Macready]], who at 54 was twenty years older than the Emperor was in 1866.\n\nThe 1939 film ''[[Juarez (film)|Juarez]]'' featured [[Paul Muni]] as Benito Ju\u00e1rez, [[Bette Davis]] as Empress Carlota, and [[Brian Aherne]] as Emperor Maximilian.  It was based, in part, on Bertita Harding's novel ''The Phantom Crown'' (1937).\n\nIn the ''[[Southern Victory|Southern Victory Series]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]], Maximilian's Empire survives the turmoil of the 1860s into the 20th century due to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] emerging victorious in its battle against the [[United States|United States of America]] in the \"[[American Civil War|War of Secession]]\"; thus, the United States becomes too weak and unwilling to pressure Maximilian's puppet state to capitulate to rebels and dissolve. It fights alongside the Confederate States against the United States in 1881\u20131882, 1914-1917 and 1941-1944 and experiences a civil war during the [[interwar years]] between republicans and [[Habsburg]] royalists. In 1881, it sold its northern provinces of Sonora and Chihuahua to the Confederacy and in 1944, it lost its extraterritorial province of Baja California to the United States after the Second Great War.\n\nThe 1990 novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'', co-authored by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling|Bruce Stirling]], is set in an alternate 1855 where the timeline diverged in 1824 with [[Charles Babbage]]'s completion of the difference engine. One consequence is the occupation of Mexico by the [[Second French Empire]] with [[Napoleon III]] as the de facto emperor instead of the installation of Emperor Maxillian.\n\nIn Mexican popular culture, there have been soap operas like \"[[El Carruaje]]\" (1967), plays, films, and historical novels such as [[Fernando del Paso]]'s ''Noticias del Imperio'' (1987). Biographies, memoirs, and novels have been published since the 1860s, and among the most recent have been Prince Michael of Greece's ''The Empress of Farewells'', available in various languages.\n\n==See also==\n*[[First Mexican Empire]]\n*[[Second French intervention in Mexico]]\n*[[Imperial Crown of Mexico]]\n*[[Emperor of Mexico]]\n*[[Mexican Imperial Orders]]\n*[[Nationalist Front of Mexico]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last=Bancroft |first=Hubert Howe |date=1887 |title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887|location=San Francisco |publisher=The History Company |pages=171\u2013173}}\n*Barker, Nancy N. : The Factor of 'Race' in the French Experience in Mexico, 1821-1861\", in: ''HAHR'', no. 59:1, pp.&nbsp;64\u201380.\n*Blumbeg.

[[Napoleon III of France]] wanted to establish a monarchist ally in the Americas as a restraint upon the growing power of the [[United States]] <ref>{{cite book |last=Guedalla|first=Philip |date=1923|title=The Second Empire |location= |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |page=322 |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>. Chosen as the Mexican emperor was Austrian Archduke [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Ferdinand Maximilian]], of the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]].\n\nPromoted by the powerful and conservative elite of Mexico's \"[[Hacienda|hacendado]]s\", with the support of the French, as well as from the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Belgian monarchy|Belgian]] crowns, the intervention attempted to create a monarchical system in Mexico, as it had functioned during the 300 years of the viceroyalty of [[New Spain]] and for the short term of the imperial independent reign of Emperor [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide|Agust\u00edn I]] of Mexico. The French attempt to establish a monarchy however triggered a civil war in Mexico, with the imperialists ultimately losing soon after the French troops withdrew from the country. The Empire came to an end on June 19, 1867, with the execution of Emperor Maximilian I by the government of the restored Mexican Republic. \n\n==History==\n{{Main|Second French intervention in Mexico}}\n\n===Mexican Monarchism===\nMexican monarchism emerged in conjunction with the struggle for independence. After [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded Spain, the initial independence movements throughout Latin America concerned themselves with supporting the deposed [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] as the legitimate king as opposed to [[Joseph Bonaparte]] who had been established as king of Spain by Napoleon. During the [[Cry of Dolores|Grito de Dolores]], Miguel Hidalgo Costilla rallied his listeners to support Ferdinand VII against the [[New Spain|New Spanish]] ruling classes that were allegedly going to betray Mexico and Catholicism over to the French. \n<ref>{{cite book |last=Fehrenbach|first=T.R. |date=1995|title=Fire and Blood: A History of Mexico |url=https://archive.org/details/firebloodhistory00fehr_0|url-access=registration|location= |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/firebloodhistory00fehr_0/page/320 320] |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nWhile his insurrection was unsuccessful the ultimate triumphant movement for Mexican independence was led by Agustin de Iturbide with his [[Plan of Iguala]], which made specific admission for a European monarch to be placed on the Mexican throne. After the offer was refused Iturbide himself assumed the throne in a barracks revolt, which was nonetheless confirmed by the Mexican congress.\n\nIturbide in his attempts to govern became increasingly autocratic, losing support of congress, and shutting the legislature down, discrediting monarchy even amongst conservatives, but the idea did not go away. In 1838, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez de Estrada|Jose Maria Gutierrez Estrada]] wrote a monarchist essay endorsing the idea of a legitimate European monarch being invited to govern Mexico. The pamphlet was addressed to the conservative president [[Anastasio Bustamante|Bustamante]], who rejected the idea.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft|first=Hubert Howe |date=1852|title=History of Mexico Vol 5 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmexico05banc |location= |publisher=The Bancroft Company |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmexico05banc/page/224 224]\u2013225|isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>\n\n===Role of France===\n[[File:Comisi\u00f3n_Mexicana_en_Miramar.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Mexican Delegation: '''Back Row''': [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Manuel Hidalgo y Esnaurr\u00edzar|Jos\u00e9 Hidalgo]], [[:es:Antonio Escand\u00f3n| Antonio Escand\u00f3n]], [[\u00c1ngel Dom\u00ednguez]], [[Antonio Peredo]], [[Adrian Woll]],[[Jose Maria de Landa]].

Prior to 1861 any interference in the affairs of Mexico by European powers would have been viewed in the U.S as a challenge to the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. In 1861 however, the U.S. was embroiled in its own conflict, the [[American Civil War]], which made the U.S. government powerless to intervene. When on July, 1861 Mexican President [[Benito Juarez]] declared a two-year moratorium on Mexican debt to France among other nations, Napoleon finally had a pretext. Encouraged by Empress Eugenie, who saw herself as the champion of the Catholic Church in Mexico, Napoleon III took advantage of the situation.\n\n[[File:Dell'Acqua Ernennung Maximilians zum Kaiser Mexikos.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Offering of the Mexican Crown by a Mexican delegation, [[Miramare Castle]], 1863.]]\n\nNapoleon III saw the opportunity to make France the great modernizing influence in the Western Hemisphere, as well as enabling the country to capture the [[South American]] markets. To give him further encouragement, there was his half brother, the [[Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny|duc de Morny]], who was the largest holder of [[Mexico|Mexican]] bonds.\n\nFrench troops landed in December, 1861, and began military operations on April, 1862. They were eventually joined by conservative Mexican generals who had never been entirely defeated in the  [[Reform War|War of Reform]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft |first=Hubert Howe |date=1887 |title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887|location=San Francisco |publisher=The History Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/worksofhuberthow14bancrich/page/51 51]|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofhuberthow14bancrich}}</ref> After [[Charles de Lorencez]] small expeditionary force was repulsed at the [[Battle of Puebla]], reinforcements were sent and placed under the command of [[\u00c9lie Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Forey|\u00c9lie Forey]]. The capital was taken by June, 1863 and the French now sought to establish a friendly Mexican government. Forey appointed a committee of thirty five Mexicans, the ''Junta Superior'' who then elected three Mexican citizens to serve as the government's executive: [[Juan Almonte|Juan Nepucemo Almonte]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Salas]], and [[Pelagio Antonio de Labastida y D\u00e1valos|Pelagio Antonio de Labastida]]. In turn this triumvirate then selected two hundred fifteen Mexican citizens to form together with the ''Junta Superior'', an ''Assembly of Notables''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft |first=Hubert Howe |date=1887 |title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887|location=San Francisco |publisher=The History Company |pages=[https://archive.org/details/worksofhuberthow14bancrich/page/77 77]\u201378|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofhuberthow14bancrich}}</ref>\n\nThe Assembly met on July, 1863 and resolved to invite Ferdinand Maximilian to be Emperor of Mexico. The executive triumvirate was formally changed into the Regency of the Mexican Empire. An official delegation left Mexico and arrived in Europe on October. Maximilian formally accepted the crown on April 10, 1864, and set sail for Mexico, arriving in [[Veracruz]] on May 28 and reaching the capital on June 12.\n\n===Maximilian's Reign=== \nOn his arrival in the summer of 1864 Maximilian declared a political amnesty for all liberals who wished to join the Empire, and his conciliation efforts eventually won over moderate liberals such as [[Jos\u00e9 Fernando Ram\u00edrez]] and [[Santiago Vidaurri]] <ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft|first=Hubert Howe |date=1888|title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887|location= |publisher=The Bancroft Company |pages=150}}</ref>. His first priorities included reforming his ministries and reforming the Imperial Mexican Army, the latter of which was impeded upon by [[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine|Bazaine]] in an effort to consolidate French control of the nation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft|first=Hubert Howe |date=1888|title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887 |location= |publisher=The Bancroft Company |pages=152}}</ref>\n\nOn August, Maximilian took a state trip through the nation while [[Carlota of Mexico|Carlota]] reigned as regent, going to [[Queretaro]], [[Guanajuato]], and [[Michoacan]], giving public audiences and visiting officials, even celebrating Mexican independence by commemorating the [[Cry of Dolores]], in the actual town where it took place. <ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft|first=Hubert Howe |date=1888|title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887 |location= |publisher=The Bancroft Company |pages=154-155}}</ref> \n\nIn December a Papal Nuncio arrived in order to arrange a concordat with the Empire revise the [[La Reforma|Reform laws]] previously passed by the Mexican government that had nationalized Catholic Church property. Maximilian wished to maintain Catholicism as the state religion, and yet preferred to keep the reform laws intact, and also introduce religious toleration, measures which disillusioned his conservative and clerical supporters <ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft|first=Hubert Howe |date=1888|title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887 | |location= |publisher=The Bancroft Company |pages=157-158}}</ref>.\n\n===Military Hostilities===\n\nIn April 1865, the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]] ended, and while the American government was reluctant at the time to enter upon a conflict with France to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, official American sympathy remained with the deposed Mexican president [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]]. The U.S. government refused to recognize the Empire and also ignored Maximilian's correspondence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft|first=Hubert Howe |date=1888|title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887| |location= |publisher=The Bancroft Company |pages=181}}</ref> In December, a thirty million dollar private American loan was approved for Juarez, and American volunteers kept joining the Mexican republican troops.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft|first=Hubert Howe |date=1888|title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887|location= |publisher=The Bancroft Company |pages=206-207}}</ref>\n\nA concentration of French troops in the north of Mexico only led to a surge of republican guerilla activity in the south. While French troops controlled major cities, guerillas continued to be a major military threat in the countryside. In an effort to combat the increasing violence and in a belief that Juarez was outside of the nation already, Maximilian in October signed a decree authorizing the court martial and execution of anyone found either aiding or participating with the guerillas. The harsh measure was hardly unprecedented in Mexican history even resembling an 1862 measure by Juarez, but it proved to be widely reviled, being branded the Black Decree, and contributing to the growing unpopularity of the Empire <ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft|first=Hubert Howe |date=1888|title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887 ||location= |publisher=The Bancroft Company |pages=183-184}}</ref>.\n\n===Fall of the Empire===\n\nIn January 1866, seeing the war as unwinnable Napoleon declared to the French Chambers that he intended to withdraw the French military from Mexico. Maximilian's request for more aid or at least a delay in troop withdrawals was denied. Carlota arrived in Europe in an attempt to plead for the Empire's cause, but was unable to gain more support. The failure of her mission apparently caused her to go insane. \n\nIn October Maximilian moved his cabinet to [[Orizaba]] and was widely rumored to be leaving the nation. He contemplated abdication, and on November 25 held a council of his ministers to address the crisis faced by the Empire. They narrowly voted against abdication and Maximilian headed back towards the capital. <ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft|first=Hubert Howe |date=1888|title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887|location= |publisher=The Bancroft Company |pages=241}}</ref> He intended to appeal to the nation in order to hold a national assembly which would then decide what form of government the Mexican nation was to take. Such a measure however would require a ceasefire from Juarez who had no such intention of conceding to what he viewed as a usurper. \n\nAs the national assembly project fell through Maximilian decided to focus on military operations and in February as the last of the French troops were leaving, the Emperor headed for the city of [[Quer\u00e9taro City|Queretaro]] to join the bulk of his loyal Mexican troops, numbering about 10,000 men. The liberal generals [[Mariano Escobedo|Escobedo]] and [[Ram\u00f3n Corona|Corona]] converged on Queretaro with 40,000 men and yet the city held out until being betrayed by an imperial officer who opened the gates to the liberals on May 15. <ref>{{cite book |last=Fehrenbach|first=T.R. |date=1995|title=Fire and Blood: A History of Mexico |url= |location= |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=438 }}</ref>\n\nMaximilian was captured and placed on trial with his leading generals [[Tom\u00e1s Mej\u00eda Camacho|Mej\u00eda]] and [[Miguel Miram\u00f3n|Miramon]]. All there were sentenced to death and executed on June 19.\n\n==Government==\n[[File:ImperialMexicanCrown1.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Mexican [[imperial crown]] and [[scepter]] as [[funerary]] insignia.

The emperor was to govern through nine ministries: of the Imperial Household, of State, of Foreign Relations, of War, of Government or Interior, of the Treasury, of Justice, of Public Instruction and Worship, and of Development. A council of state was given the power to frame bills and give advice to the emperor, and a separate private cabinet, serving as the emperor's liaison, was divided into civil and military affairs.

The main goal was connecting the port of Veracruz and the capital in Mexico City. In 1857, Don Antonio Escand\u00f3n secured the right to build a line from the port of Veracruz to Mexico City and on to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Revolution and political instability stifled progress on the financing or construction of the line until 1864, when, under the regime of [[Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]], the Imperial Mexican Railway Company began construction of the line. Political upheaval continued to stifle progress, and the initial segment from Veracruz to Mexico City was inaugurated nine years later on January 1, 1873 by President [[Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada]].\n\n[[File:21Puente_de_Wimer-Cumbre_de_Maltrata.png|thumb|right|250px|Mexican Railway, Bridge by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco G\u00f3mez]] 1877.]]\n\nIn 1857 the original proprietors of the government concession, the Masso Brothers, inaugurated on the 4th of July the train service from Tlatelolco, in M\u00e9xico City, to the nearby town of [[Villa de Guadalupe, Mexico City|Guadalupe Hidalgo]].<ref>[http://www.fotolog.com/ahuicyani/77908717/ Ferrocarril de M\u00e9xico a La Villa]</ref> Eventually they ran out of funds and decided to sell it to Manuel Escand\u00f3n and Antonio Escand\u00f3n.<ref>[https://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/ferrocarril-ruta-vital.html La historia del tren en M\u00e9xico]</ref> The Escand\u00f3n Brothers continued working and the project, and Antonio Escand\u00f3n visited the United States and England in the last months of the year. In the first country, he hired Andrew Talcott, and in the latter, he sold company stock. Exploration of a route from Orizaba to Maltrata was performed by engineers Andrew H. Talcott and Pascual Almaz\u00e1n.\n\n[[File:14Orizaba_desde_el_Puente_de_Paso_del_Toro.png|thumb|left|250px|Mexican Railway, Bridge by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco G\u00f3mez]] 1877.]]\n[[File:Jos\u00e9_Mar\u00eda_Velasco_-_The_Metlac_Ravine_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco - The Metlac Ravine.]]\n\nDuring the French intervention, part of the railways were destroyed. The only option available was the establishment of a pact between the French Army, and the two companies of the Escand\u00f3n Brothers.

Contempor\u00e1nea de M\u00e9xico, UNAM</ref>\n\n==Immigration==\nMaximilian intended to aid the development of the country by opening up the nation to immigration, regardless of racial origin. An immigration agency was set up to promote immigration from the United States, the Confederate States, Germany, and Asia. Colonists were to be granted citizenship at once, and gained exemption from taxes for the first year, and an exemption from military services for five years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bancroft |first=Hubert Howe |date=1887 |title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887|location=San Francisco |publisher=The History Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/worksofhuberthow14bancrich/page/174 174]|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofhuberthow14bancrich}}</ref>\n\nSome of the most prominent colonization settlements were the [[Villa Carlota, Mexico|Villa Carlota]] and the [[New Virginia Colony]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Castillo_de_Chapultepec_(Museo_Nacional_de_Historia).JPG|thumb|left|300px|[[Chapultepec Castle]]]]\nIn spite of lasting in power only a few years, Maximilian managed to leave behind constructions that remain prominent even in present-day Mexico City.\n\nFor his royal residence, Maximilian decided to renovate a former viceregal villa in Mexico City, which was also notable for being the site of a battle during the U.S. invasion of Mexico. The result would be Chapultepec Castle, the only castle in North America ever to be used by actual royalty. While formerly serving as the official home of Mexican presidents, today the site is a museum.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chapultepec-castle|title=Chapultepec Castle: The only castle in North America to ever house actual sovereigns.}}</ref>\n\nIn order to connect the palace to the government offices in Mexico city, Maximilian also built a prominent road which he called Paseo de la Emperatriz (''The Empress' Promenade'').  After the fall of the Empire, the government renamed it Paseo de la Reforma (''Promenade of the Reform'') to commemorate President Juarez and the reforms that he helped to legislate. In the present, it continues to be one of the most prominent avenues of the capital and is lined with civic monuments.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mexperience.com/paseo-de-la-reforma/|title=Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City}}</ref>\n\nToday, the Second Mexican Empire is advocated by small far-right groups like the [[Nationalist Front of Mexico]], whose followers believe the Empire to have been a legitimate attempt to deliver Mexico from the hegemony of the [[United States]]. They are reported to gather every year at Quer\u00e9taro, the place where Maximilian and his generals were executed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nacionalistas.org/2012/06/homenaje-los-martires-del-segundo.html |title=Homage to the Martyrs of the Second Mexican Empire |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503115911/http://www.nacionalistas.org/2012/06/homenaje-los-martires-del-segundo.html |archivedate=3 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{History of Mexico |1864-1928}}\n\nThe 1970 film ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' was set in Mexico during the years of the Second Mexican Empire. The two main characters, played by [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]], aided a Mexican resistance force and ultimately led them to overpower a French garrison.\n\nThe 1969 film ''[[The Undefeated (1969 film)|The Undefeated]]'' starring [[John Wayne]] and [[Rock Hudson]] portrays events during the French Intervention in Mexico and was also loosely based on the escape of [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General]] [[Sterling Price]] to Mexico after the [[American Civil War]] and his attempt to join with Maximilian's forces.\n\nThe 1965 film ''[[Major Dundee]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Richard Harris]] featured [[Union Army|Union]] cavalry (supplemented by [[Galvanized Yankees]]) crossing into Mexico and fighting French forces towards the end of the American Civil War.\n\nThe 1954 film ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'' was also set in Mexico and has an appearance of Maximilian having a target shooting competition with [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Burt Lancaster]]'s character at [[Chapultepec Castle]]. Maximilian was played by [[George Macready]], who at 54 was twenty years older than the Emperor was in 1866.\n\nThe 1939 film ''[[Juarez (film)|Juarez]]'' featured [[Paul Muni]] as Benito Ju\u00e1rez, [[Bette Davis]] as Empress Carlota, and [[Brian Aherne]] as Emperor Maximilian.  It was based, in part, on Bertita Harding's novel ''The Phantom Crown'' (1937).\n\nIn the ''[[Southern Victory|Southern Victory Series]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]], Maximilian's Empire survives the turmoil of the 1860s into the 20th century due to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] emerging victorious in its battle against the [[United States|United States of America]] in the \"[[American Civil War|War of Secession]]\"; thus, the United States becomes too weak and unwilling to pressure Maximilian's puppet state to capitulate to rebels and dissolve. It fights alongside the Confederate States against the United States in 1881\u20131882, 1914-1917 and 1941-1944 and experiences a civil war during the [[interwar years]] between republicans and [[Habsburg]] royalists. In 1881, it sold its northern provinces of Sonora and Chihuahua to the Confederacy and in 1944, it lost its extraterritorial province of Baja California to the United States after the Second Great War.\n\nThe 1990 novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'', co-authored by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling|Bruce Stirling]], is set in an alternate 1855 where the timeline diverged in 1824 with [[Charles Babbage]]'s completion of the difference engine. One consequence is the occupation of Mexico by the [[Second French Empire]] with [[Napoleon III]] as the de facto emperor instead of the installation of Emperor Maxillian.\n\nIn Mexican popular culture, there have been soap operas like \"[[El Carruaje]]\" (1967), plays, films, and historical novels such as [[Fernando del Paso]]'s ''Noticias del Imperio'' (1987). Biographies, memoirs, and novels have been published since the 1860s, and among the most recent have been Prince Michael of Greece's ''The Empress of Farewells'', available in various languages.\n\n==See also==\n*[[First Mexican Empire]]\n*[[Second French intervention in Mexico]]\n*[[Imperial Crown of Mexico]]\n*[[Emperor of Mexico]]\n*[[Mexican Imperial Orders]]\n*[[Nationalist Front of Mexico]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last=Bancroft |first=Hubert Howe |date=1887 |title=History of Mexico Volume VI 1861-1887|location=San Francisco |publisher=The History Company |pages=171\u2013173}}\n*Barker, Nancy N. : The Factor of 'Race' in the French Experience in Mexico, 1821-1861\", in: ''HAHR'', no. 59:1, pp.&nbsp;64\u201380.\n*Blumbeg.
