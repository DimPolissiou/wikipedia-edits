The tank weighed almost 70 [[tonne]]s, and was protected by {{convert|100|to|185|mm|abbr=on}} of armour to the front.<ref name=\"J&Darmor\"/> It was armed with the long barrelled [[8.8 cm KwK 43|8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71]] anti-tank cannon.<ref group=notes>''Kampfwagenkanone'' \u2013 abbr: ''KwK'' (English: \"fighting vehicle cannon\")</ref> The chassis was also the basis for the [[Jagdtiger]] [[Casemate#Armoured vehicles|turretless]] [[Jagdpanzer]] anti-tank vehicle.<ref name=\"Schneider19\">Schneider 1990, p. 18.</ref>\n\nThe Tiger II was issued to [[German heavy tank battalion|heavy tank battalions]] of the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|Army]] and the [[Waffen-SS]]. It was first used in combat by [[503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion]] during the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]] on 11 July 1944;<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 37.</ref> on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the first unit to be outfitted with the Tiger II was the [[501st Heavy Panzer Battalion]], which by 1 September 1944 listed 25 Tiger IIs operational.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment of a heavy tank design had been initiated in 1937; the initial design contract was awarded to [[Henschel & Son|Henschel]]. Another design contract followed in 1939, and was given to [[Ferdinand Porsche|Porsche]].<ref name=\"Jentz & Doyle 1993, p. 3\">Jentz & Doyle 1993, p. 3.</ref> Both prototype series used the same turret design from [[Krupp]]; the main differences were in the hull, transmission, suspension and automotive features.<ref name=\"Jentz & Doyle 1993, p. 3\"/>\n\n[[File:Chambois1.jpg|thumb|left|[[SHAEF]] commander Gen. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] walks by an overturned Tiger II. The overlapping, non-interleaved steel-rim roadwheel arrangement is visible.]]\nThe Henschel version used a conventional hull design with sloped armour resembling the layout of the Panther tank. It had a rear-mounted engine and used nine steel-tired, eighty-centimeter-diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing, mounted on [[Torsion bar suspension|transverse torsion bars]], in a similar manner to the original Henschel-designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance, however, as when the same steel-tired road wheels were used on later Tiger I hulls, the wheels were only overlapping ''without'' being interleaved\u2014the full ''Schachtellaufwerk'' rubber-rimmed road-wheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved design, later inherited by the early production versions of the Tiger&nbsp;I<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> and Panther.\n\nThe Porsche hull designs included a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension was the same as on the ''[[Elefant]]'' tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired [[bogies]] sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a [[Diesel-electric transmission]], only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]), similar to a [[gasoline-electric hybrid]] but without a storage battery; two separate [[drivetrain]]s in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine\u2013[[electric generator]]\u2013electric motor\u2013drive [[sprocket]]. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the [[VK4501|Tiger (P)]] (later ''Elefant'' prototypes) and in some US designs and was put into production in the WW1 [[Saint-Chamond (tank)|Saint-Chamond]] tank and the post-WW1 FCM [[Char 2C]]. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later ''[[Jagdtiger]]'' tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Munster Koenigstiger Porscheturm Modell detail.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A tank turret with a front face which curves up and down.

The rough [[Zimmerit]] coating is evident, used to prevent magnetic mines from adhering to the tank's armour.]]\n\nHenschel won the design contract, and all Tiger IIs were produced by the firm.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 17</ref> Two turret designs were used in production vehicles. The initial design is often misleadingly called the Tiger II (P), after the \"Porsche\" turret due to the misbelief that it was designed by Porsche for their [[VK 4502 (P)|prototype]]; in fact it was the initial Krupp design for both prototypes.<ref name=\":0\" /> This turret had a rounded front and steeply sloped sides, with a difficult-to-manufacture curved bulge on the turret's left side to accommodate the commander's cupola. Fifty early turrets were mounted to Henschel's hull and used in action. In December 1943 the more common \"production\" turret, sometimes erroneously called the \"Henschel\" turret, was simplified with a significantly thicker flat face, no [[shot trap]] (created by the curved face of the earlier turret), and less-steeply sloped sides, which prevented the need for a bulge for the commander's cupola, and added additional room for ammunition storage.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 13\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe turrets were designed to mount the [[8.8 cm KwK 43]] L/71 gun. Combined with the ''Turmzielfernrohr'' 9d (German \"turret telescopic sight\") monocular sight by Leitz, which all but a few early Tiger IIs used, it was a very accurate and deadly weapon. During practice, the estimated probability of a first-round hit on a {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}} wide target was 100 percent at {{convert|1000|m|mi|abbr=on}}, 95\u201397 percent at {{convert|1500|m|mi|abbr=on}} and 85\u201387 percent at {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=on}}, depending on ammunition type. Recorded combat performance was lower, but still over 80 percent at 1,000&nbsp;m, in the 60s at 1,500&nbsp;m and the 40s at 2,000&nbsp;m. Penetration of armoured plate inclined at 30 degrees was {{convert|202|and|132|mm|abbr=on}} at {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=on}} respectively for the [[Panzergranate 39|''Panzergranate'' 39/43]] projectile (PzGr\u2014[[armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing shell]]), and {{convert|238|and|153|mm|abbr=on}} for the PzGr. 40/43 projectile between the same ranges. The ''Sprenggranate'' 43 (SpGr) high-explosive round was available for soft targets, or the ''Hohlgranate'' or ''Hohlgeschoss'' 39 (HlGr\u2014HEAT or [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead]]) round, which had {{convert|90|mm|abbr=on}} penetration at any range, could be used as a dual-purpose munition against soft or armoured targets.<ref name=\"J&D23-24\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\nPowered turret traverse was provided by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft. A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees at 6\u00ba/second in low gear independent of engine rpm, at 19\u00ba/second \u2014 [[Tiger I#Mobility and reliability|the same as with the Tiger I]] \u2014  with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm, and over 36\u00ba/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse were controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, or a control lever near his left arm. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually rotate the turret at a rate of one-half a degree per each revolution of the hand crank (i.e. 20\u00b0 turret rotation required 40 full cranks of the handwheel, and to turn the turret a full 360\u00b0 the gunner would be required to crank the handwheel 720 full revolutions).\n\n[[File:Tiger II mg 7802.jpg|thumb|alt=The overhanging rear face of a large tank, two laterally spaced exhaust pipes protrude from mountings, pointing upwards, curving away from the vehicle at their ends.|Rear view showing dual exhausts]]\nLike all German tanks, the Tiger II had a [[petrol engine]]; in this case the same 700 [[Horsepower#PS|PS]] (690&nbsp;hp, 515&nbsp;kW) V-12 [[Maybach HL230|Maybach HL 230 P30]] which powered the much lighter [[Panther tank|Panther]] and [[Tiger I]] tanks. The Tiger II was under-powered, like many other heavy tanks of World War II, and consumed a lot of fuel, which was in short supply for the Germans. The transmission was the Maybach OLVAR EG 40 12 16 Model B, giving eight forward gears and four reverse, which drove the steering gear. This was the Henschel L 801, a double radius design which proved susceptible to failure. Transverse torsion bar suspension supported the hull on nine axles per side. Overlapped {{convert|800|mm|abbr=on}} diameter road wheels with rubber cushions and steel tyres rode inside the tracks.<ref name=\"J&D11-12\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nLike the Tiger I, each tank was issued with two sets of tracks: a normal \"battle track\" and a narrower \"transport\" version used during rail movement. The transport tracks reduced the overall width of the load and could be used to drive the tank short distances on firm ground. The crew were expected to change to normal battle tracks as soon as the tank was unloaded. Ground pressure was 0.76&nbsp;kg/cm<sup>2</sup> (10.8 psi).<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 13.</ref>\n\n===Command variant===\nThe command variant of the Tiger II was designated ''Panzerbefehlswagen'' Tiger ''Ausf. B''. It had two versions, ''Sd.Kfz''. 267 and ''Sd.Kfz''. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8&nbsp;cm ammunition to provide room to    accommodate the extra radios and equipment,<ref name=\"J&D16\"/> and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The ''Sd.Kfz''. 267 was to have used ''FuG'' 8 and ''FuG'' 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|spell=in}} rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a ''Sternantenne D'' (\"Star antenna D\"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105&nbsp;mm ''Antennenfu\u00df Nr. 1''), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment.<ref name=\"J&D16\"/> The ''Sd.Kfz''. 268 used ''FuG'' 7 and ''FuG'' 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted on the rear deck.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe Tiger II was developed late in the war and built in relatively small numbers. Orders were placed for 1,500 Tiger IIs\u2014slightly more than the 1,347 [[Tiger I]] tanks produced\u2014but production was severely disrupted by Allied bombing raids.<ref name=\"Manchester68-498\">Manchester 1968, p. 498.</ref> Among others, five raids between 22 September and 7 October 1944 destroyed 95 percent of the floor area of the Henschel plant. It is estimated that this caused the loss in production of some 657 Tiger IIs.<ref name=\"J&D17\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 17.</ref> Only 492 units were produced: one in 1943, 379 in 1944, and 112 in 1945.

The AK-7-200 was also explored as an alternative to the Maybach Olvar-B drive train, but ''[[Waffenamt]]'' research and development department ''Wa Pr\u00fcf 6'' found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the Maybach Olvar-B was retained.<ref name=\"J&D1997.144-154\">{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|last2=Doyle|first2=Hilary|title=Germany's Tiger Tanks: VK45.02 to TIGER II Design, Production & Modifications|date=1997|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd|isbn=0764302248|pages=144\u2013154}}</ref> There was also a program using the Simmering-Graz-Pauker Sla.16 engine, but the war's constraint on supplies and capitulation resulted in the cancellation of this program.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon, the [[10.5 cm]] KwK L/68.

The 503rd then took part in the [[Battle of Debrecen]]. The 503rd remained in the Hungarian theater of operations for 166 days, during which it accounted for at least 121 Soviet tanks, 244 anti-tank guns and artillery pieces, five aircraft and a train. This was set against the loss of 25 Tiger IIs; ten were knocked out by Soviet troops and burned out, two were sent back to Vienna for a factory overhaul, while thirteen were blown up by their crews for various reasons, usually to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. [[Kurt Knispel]], the highest scoring tank ace of all time (162 enemy [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s destroyed), also served with the 503rd, and was killed in action on 29 April 1945 in his Tiger II.<ref name=\"Sz\u00e1mv\u00e9ber147\">Sz\u00e1mv\u00e9ber, 2000. p. 147.</ref>\n\nThe Tiger II was also used in significant numbers, distributed into four heavy panzer battalions, during the [[Ardennes Offensive]] (also known as the Battle of the Bulge) of December 1944.<ref>Schneider 2005, pp. 214\u2013216.</ref> At least 150 Tiger IIs were present, nearly a third of total production, and most were lost during the course of the offensive.<ref>Green, Michael. \"German Tanks of World War II\".

This was especially true on the Western Front where, until the arrival of the few [[M26 Pershing]]s in 1945 and the few [[M4 Sherman#Upgrades|M4A3E2 Sherman \"Jumbo\"s]] that were scattered around Europe after D-Day, neither the British nor US forces brought heavy tanks into service. A ''Wa Pr\u00fcf 1'' report estimated that the Tiger II's frontal aspect was impervious to the 122&nbsp;mm D-25T, the heaviest although not the best penetrating tank gun on the Allied side. On the other hand, an R.A.C 3.d. document of February 1945 estimated that the British [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|QF 17-pounder (76.2 mm)]] gun, using [[armour-piercing discarding sabot]] shot was theoretically capable of penetrating the front of the Tiger II's turret and nose (lower front hull) at {{convert|1100|and|1200|yd|m|abbr=on}} respectively although, given the lack of a stated angle, this is presumably at the ideal 90 degrees angle.<ref name=\"KTHT34-36\">{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|last2=Doyle|first2=Hilary|title=Kingtiger Heavy Tank 1942\u201345|date=1993|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd|isbn=185532282X|pages=34\u201336|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATawrvkJBAUC&pg=PA35}}</ref> Some sources {{who|date=July 2018}} claimed that there is no proof that the glacis armour of the Tiger II was ever penetrated in combat.<ref>{{cite web |title = PzKpfw VI Tiger II |url = http://www.fprado.com/armorsite/tiger2.htm |work = The Armor Site! |publisher=Fabio Prado |accessdate = 23 November 2015}}</ref>{{better source|fprado.com is a tertiary source with unknown editorial oversight|date=July 2018}}\n\nAs a result of its thick frontal armour, flanking manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements.<ref name=\"Jary274\">Jarymowycz 2001, p. 274.</ref> Moreover, the main armament of the Tiger II was capable of knocking out any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding {{convert|2.5|km}}, well beyond the effective range of Allied tank guns.<ref name=\"Jary258\">Jarymowycz 2001, p. 258.</ref>\n\n===Soviet wartime testing===\n\nDuring August 1944, two Tiger Ausf B tanks were captured by the Soviets near [[Sandomierz]], and were soon moved to the testing grounds at [[Kubinka]]. During the transfer, the two tanks suffered from various mechanical breakdowns; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather, where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox. The right suspension of one of the tanks had to be completely replaced, and its full functionality could not be re-established. The tank broke down again every 10\u201315&nbsp;km. The [[8.8 cm KwK 43]] gave positive results in penetration and accuracy, which were on par with the 122&nbsp;mm D-25T. It proved capable of passing completely through its \"colleague\", a Tiger Ausf B's turret at a range of 400 m. The armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152&nbsp;mm calibre. The welding was, despite careful workmanship, significantly worse than on similar designs. As a result, even when shells did not penetrate the armour, there was often a large amount of [[spalling]] from the inside of the plates, which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable. Further testing showed that the armour plate itself exhibited deficiencies in quality compared to earlier German tanks such as the Tiger I and Panther. Lab testing found that the armour plates lacked molybdenum (ascribed to a loss of supply, being replaced by vanadium), resulting in low malleability.<ref name=\"Tigertest\"/>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe expanded firing test states that the [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|\u0410\u0420]] projectiles from the [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100 mm BS-3]] and [[122 mm gun M1931 (A-19)|122 mm A-19]] gun penetrated a Tiger Ausf B's turret at ranges of 1000\u20131500 metres, which suggests a quality factor of 0.86 for the Tiger Ausf B's turret. The firing test against the Tiger B turret front, however, was conducted after removal of the gun and mantlet, and resulted in penetrations close to armour openings, such as vision slits and gun location. The penetrations to the right gun opening were influenced by previous 100&nbsp;mm projectile penetration hits or armour damage.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Lorrin Rexford|last2=Livingston|first2=Robert D.|title=WWII Ballistics - Armour and Gunnery|date=2001|publisher=Overmatch Press|page=90|<!-- accessdate=22 January 2015 -->}}</ref> Some {{who|date=July 2018}} have said the tank's hull and turret side plates were penetrated by [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|\u0410\u0420 shot]] from domestic 85&nbsp;mm and American 76&nbsp;mm guns at ranges of {{convert|800|-|2000|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Tigertest\">{{cite web |url=http://english.battlefield.ru/analytics/126-was-the-tiger-really-king.html |title=Was the Tiger really King?: Testing the King Tiger at Kubinka |work=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate= 2009-10-20 |date=19 September 2011 |quote=source: Tankomaster #6 1999.}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} The [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100 mm BS-3]] and [[122 mm gun M1931 (A-19)|122 mm A-19]] could also penetrate the weld joints of the front hull at ranges of 500\u2013600 metres after 3\u20134 shots.<ref name=\"Tekhnika molodezhi\">{{cite book|last1=Zheltov|first1=Igor|title= TankoMaster Special Issues 02, 2002: Isoif Stalin|publisher= Tekhnika molodezhi|page=33}}</ref>\n\nSome {{who|date=July 2018}} have said the large 122&nbsp;mm OF-471 (\u041e\u0424-471) [[High explosive|HE]] projectiles, equipped with a 3.8&nbsp;kg [[TNT]] charge, would easily crack and could even completely tear off the front armor plate at the seam weld, blow off the turret and driver sprocket<ref name=\"books.google.com.vn\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&pg=PA41&dq=is-2+powerful&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVsremgMvSAhUIU7wKHaX5DswQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=is-2%20powerful&f=false The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II, Chris Bishop, P. 41]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}, mechanical shock and explosion was often enough to knock out enemy heavy tanks without any armor penetration<ref name=\"books.google.com.vn\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=RLjQDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=122mm+shell+effect&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=122mm%20shell%20effect&f=false Soviet Heavy Tanks: World War 2 In Review Special]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Surviving vehicles==\n[[File:Koenigstiger Saumur F.jpg|thumb|alt=The side of a large tank with wide, wavy green and grey striped camouflage, as it drives past, the commander sitting in the cupola.|The working Tiger II of the ''Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s'' being displayed to the public, 2005]]The only working example is displayed at the ''[[Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s]]'', [[Saumur]], France.

The tank weighed almost 70 [[tonne]]s, and was protected by {{convert|100|to|185|mm|abbr=on}} of armour to the front.<ref name=\"J&Darmor\"/> It was armed with the long barrelled [[8.8 cm KwK 43|8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71]] anti-tank cannon.<ref group=notes>''Kampfwagenkanone'' \u2013 abbr: ''KwK'' (English: \"fighting vehicle cannon\")</ref> The chassis was also the basis for the [[Jagdtiger]] [[Casemate#Armoured vehicles|turretless]] [[Jagdpanzer]] anti-tank vehicle.<ref name=\"Schneider19\">Schneider 1990, p. 18.</ref>\n\nThe Tiger II was issued to [[German heavy tank battalion|heavy tank battalions]] of the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|Army]] and the [[Waffen-SS]].

Another design contract followed in 1939, and was given to [[Ferdinand Porsche|Porsche]].<ref name=\"Jentz & Doyle 1993, p. 3\">Jentz & Doyle 1993, p. 3.</ref> Both prototype series used the same turret design from [[Krupp]]; the main differences were in the hull, transmission, suspension and automotive features.<ref name=\"Jentz & Doyle 1993, p. 3\"/>\n\n[[File:Chambois1.jpg|thumb|left|[[SHAEF]] commander Gen. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] walks by an overturned Tiger II. The overlapping, non-interleaved steel-rim roadwheel arrangement is visible.]]\nThe Henschel version used a conventional hull design with sloped armour resembling the layout of the Panther tank. It had a rear-mounted engine and used nine steel-tired, eighty-centimeter-diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing, mounted on [[Torsion bar suspension|transverse torsion bars]], in a similar manner to the original Henschel-designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance, however, as when the same steel-tired road wheels were used on later Tiger I hulls, the wheels were only overlapping ''without'' being interleaved\u2014the full ''Schachtellaufwerk'' rubber-rimmed road-wheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved design, later inherited by the early production versions of the Tiger&nbsp;I<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> and Panther.\n\nThe Porsche hull designs included a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension was the same as on the ''[[Elefant]]'' tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired [[bogies]] sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a [[Diesel-electric transmission]], only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]), similar to a [[gasoline-electric hybrid]] but without a storage battery; two separate [[drivetrain]]s in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine\u2013[[electric generator]]\u2013electric motor\u2013drive [[sprocket]]. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the [[VK4501|Tiger (P)]] (later ''Elefant'' prototypes) and in some US designs and was put into production in the WW1 [[Saint-Chamond (tank)|Saint-Chamond]] tank and the post-WW1 FCM [[Char 2C]]. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later ''[[Jagdtiger]]'' tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Munster Koenigstiger Porscheturm Modell detail.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A tank turret with a front face which curves up and down.

The rough [[Zimmerit]] coating is evident, used to prevent magnetic mines from adhering to the tank's armour.]]\n\nHenschel won the design contract, and all Tiger IIs were produced by the firm.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 17</ref> Two turret designs were used in production vehicles. The initial design is often misleadingly called the Tiger II (P), after the \"Porsche\" turret due to the misbelief that it was designed by Porsche for their [[VK 4502 (P)|prototype]]; in fact it was the initial Krupp design for both prototypes.<ref name=\":0\" /> This turret had a rounded front and steeply sloped sides, with a difficult-to-manufacture curved bulge on the turret's left side to accommodate the commander's cupola. Fifty early turrets were mounted to Henschel's hull and used in action. In December 1943 the more common \"production\" turret, sometimes erroneously called the \"Henschel\" turret, was simplified with a significantly thicker flat face, no [[shot trap]] (created by the curved face of the earlier turret), and less-steeply sloped sides, which prevented the need for a bulge for the commander's cupola, and added additional room for ammunition storage.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 13\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe turrets were designed to mount the [[8.8 cm KwK 43]] L/71 gun. Combined with the ''Turmzielfernrohr'' 9d (German \"turret telescopic sight\") monocular sight by Leitz, which all but a few early Tiger IIs used, it was a very accurate and deadly weapon. During practice, the estimated probability of a first-round hit on a {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}} wide target was 100 percent at {{convert|1000|m|mi|abbr=on}}, 95\u201397 percent at {{convert|1500|m|mi|abbr=on}} and 85\u201387 percent at {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=on}}, depending on ammunition type. Recorded combat performance was lower, but still over 80 percent at 1,000&nbsp;m, in the 60s at 1,500&nbsp;m and the 40s at 2,000&nbsp;m. Penetration of armoured plate inclined at 30 degrees was {{convert|202|and|132|mm|abbr=on}} at {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=on}} respectively for the [[Panzergranate 39|''Panzergranate'' 39/43]] projectile (PzGr\u2014[[armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing shell]]), and {{convert|238|and|153|mm|abbr=on}} for the PzGr. 40/43 projectile between the same ranges. The ''Sprenggranate'' 43 (SpGr) high-explosive round was available for soft targets, or the ''Hohlgranate'' or ''Hohlgeschoss'' 39 (HlGr\u2014HEAT or [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead]]) round, which had {{convert|90|mm|abbr=on}} penetration at any range, could be used as a dual-purpose munition against soft or armoured targets.<ref name=\"J&D23-24\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\nPowered turret traverse was provided by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft. A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees at 6\u00ba/second in low gear independent of engine rpm, at 19\u00ba/second \u2014 [[Tiger I#Mobility and reliability|the same as with the Tiger I]] \u2014  with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm, and over 36\u00ba/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse were controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, or a control lever near his left arm. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually rotate the turret at a rate of one-half a degree per each revolution of the hand crank (i.e. 20\u00b0 turret rotation required 40 full cranks of the handwheel, and to turn the turret a full 360\u00b0 the gunner would be required to crank the handwheel 720 full revolutions).\n\n[[File:Tiger II mg 7802.jpg|thumb|alt=The overhanging rear face of a large tank, two laterally spaced exhaust pipes protrude from mountings, pointing upwards, curving away from the vehicle at their ends.|Rear view showing dual exhausts]]\nLike all German tanks, the Tiger II had a [[petrol engine]]; in this case the same 700 [[Horsepower#PS|PS]] (690&nbsp;hp, 515&nbsp;kW) V-12 [[Maybach HL230|Maybach HL 230 P30]] which powered the much lighter [[Panther tank|Panther]] and [[Tiger I]] tanks. The Tiger II was under-powered, like many other heavy tanks of World War II, and consumed a lot of fuel, which was in short supply for the Germans. The transmission was the Maybach OLVAR EG 40 12 16 Model B, giving eight forward gears and four reverse, which drove the steering gear. This was the Henschel L 801, a double radius design which proved susceptible to failure. Transverse torsion bar suspension supported the hull on nine axles per side. Overlapped {{convert|800|mm|abbr=on}} diameter road wheels with rubber cushions and steel tyres rode inside the tracks.<ref name=\"J&D11-12\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nLike the Tiger I, each tank was issued with two sets of tracks: a normal \"battle track\" and a narrower \"transport\" version used during rail movement. The transport tracks reduced the overall width of the load and could be used to drive the tank short distances on firm ground. The crew were expected to change to normal battle tracks as soon as the tank was unloaded. Ground pressure was 0.76&nbsp;kg/cm<sup>2</sup> (10.8 psi).<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 13.</ref>\n\n===Command variant===\nThe command variant of the Tiger II was designated ''Panzerbefehlswagen'' Tiger ''Ausf. B''. It had two versions, ''Sd.Kfz''. 267 and ''Sd.Kfz''. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8&nbsp;cm ammunition to provide room to    accommodate the extra radios and equipment,<ref name=\"J&D16\"/> and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The ''Sd.Kfz''. 267 was to have used ''FuG'' 8 and ''FuG'' 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|spell=in}} rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a ''Sternantenne D'' (\"Star antenna D\"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105&nbsp;mm ''Antennenfu\u00df Nr. 1''), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment.<ref name=\"J&D16\"/> The ''Sd.Kfz''. 268 used ''FuG'' 7 and ''FuG'' 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted on the rear deck.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe Tiger II was developed late in the war and built in relatively small numbers. Orders were placed for 1,500 Tiger IIs\u2014slightly more than the 1,347 [[Tiger I]] tanks produced\u2014but production was severely disrupted by Allied bombing raids.<ref name=\"Manchester68-498\">Manchester 1968, p. 498.</ref> Among others, five raids between 22 September and 7 October 1944 destroyed 95 percent of the floor area of the Henschel plant.

This was especially true on the Western Front where, until the arrival of the few [[M26 Pershing]]s in 1945 and the few [[M4 Sherman#Upgrades|M4A3E2 Sherman \"Jumbo\"s]] that were scattered around Europe after D-Day, neither the British nor US forces brought heavy tanks into service. A ''Wa Pr\u00fcf 1'' report estimated that the Tiger II's frontal aspect was impervious to the 122&nbsp;mm D-25T, the heaviest although not the best penetrating tank gun on the Allied side. On the other hand, an R.A.C 3.d. document of February 1945 estimated that the British [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|QF 17-pounder (76.2 mm)]] gun, using [[armour-piercing discarding sabot]] shot was theoretically capable of penetrating the front of the Tiger II's turret and nose (lower front hull) at {{convert|1100|and|1200|yd|m|abbr=on}} respectively although, given the lack of a stated angle, this is presumably at the ideal 90 degrees angle.<ref name=\"KTHT34-36\">{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|last2=Doyle|first2=Hilary|title=Kingtiger Heavy Tank 1942\u201345|date=1993|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd|isbn=185532282X|pages=34\u201336|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATawrvkJBAUC&pg=PA35}}</ref> Some sources {{who|date=July 2018}} claimed that there is no proof that the glacis armour of the Tiger II was ever penetrated in combat.<ref>{{cite web |title = PzKpfw VI Tiger II |url = http://www.fprado.com/armorsite/tiger2.htm |work = The Armor Site! |publisher=Fabio Prado |accessdate = 23 November 2015}}</ref>{{better source|fprado.com is a tertiary source with unknown editorial oversight|date=July 2018}}\n\nAs a result of its thick frontal armour, flanking manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements.<ref name=\"Jary274\">Jarymowycz 2001, p. 274.</ref> Moreover, the main armament of the Tiger II was capable of knocking out any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding {{convert|2.5|km}}, well beyond the effective range of Allied tank guns.<ref name=\"Jary258\">Jarymowycz 2001, p. 258.</ref>\n\n===Soviet wartime testing===\n\nDuring August 1944, two Tiger Ausf B tanks were captured by the Soviets near [[Sandomierz]], and were soon moved to the testing grounds at [[Kubinka]]. During the transfer, the two tanks suffered from various mechanical breakdowns; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather, where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox. The right suspension of one of the tanks had to be completely replaced, and its full functionality could not be re-established. The tank broke down again every 10\u201315&nbsp;km. The [[8.8 cm KwK 43]] gave positive results in penetration and accuracy, which were on par with the 122&nbsp;mm D-25T. It proved capable of passing completely through its \"colleague\", a Tiger Ausf B's turret at a range of 400 m. The armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152&nbsp;mm calibre. The welding was, despite careful workmanship, significantly worse than on similar designs. As a result, even when shells did not penetrate the armour, there was often a large amount of [[spalling]] from the inside of the plates, which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable. Further testing showed that the armour plate itself exhibited deficiencies in quality compared to earlier German tanks such as the Tiger I and Panther. Lab testing found that the armour plates lacked molybdenum (ascribed to a loss of supply, being replaced by vanadium), resulting in low malleability.<ref name=\"Tigertest\"/>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe expanded firing test states that the [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|\u0410\u0420]] projectiles from the [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100 mm BS-3]] and [[122 mm gun M1931 (A-19)|122 mm A-19]] gun penetrated a Tiger Ausf B's turret at ranges of 1000\u20131500 metres, which suggests a quality factor of 0.86 for the Tiger Ausf B's turret. The firing test against the Tiger B turret front, however, was conducted after removal of the gun and mantlet, and resulted in penetrations close to armour openings, such as vision slits and gun location. The penetrations to the right gun opening were influenced by previous 100&nbsp;mm projectile penetration hits or armour damage.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Lorrin Rexford|last2=Livingston|first2=Robert D.|title=WWII Ballistics - Armour and Gunnery|date=2001|publisher=Overmatch Press|page=90|<!-- accessdate=22 January 2015 -->}}</ref> Some {{who|date=July 2018}} have said the tank's hull and turret side plates were penetrated by [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|\u0410\u0420 shot]] from domestic 85&nbsp;mm and American 76&nbsp;mm guns at ranges of {{convert|800|-|2000|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Tigertest\">{{cite web |url=http://english.battlefield.ru/analytics/126-was-the-tiger-really-king.html |title=Was the Tiger really King?: Testing the King Tiger at Kubinka |work=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate= 2009-10-20 |date=19 September 2011 |quote=source: Tankomaster #6 1999.}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} The [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100 mm BS-3]] and [[122 mm gun M1931 (A-19)|122 mm A-19]] could also penetrate the weld joints of the front hull at ranges of 500\u2013600 metres after 3\u20134 shots.<ref name=\"Tekhnika molodezhi\">{{cite book|last1=Zheltov|first1=Igor|title= TankoMaster Special Issues 02, 2002: Isoif Stalin|publisher= Tekhnika molodezhi|page=33}}</ref>\n\nSome {{who|date=July 2018}} have said the large 122&nbsp;mm OF-471 (\u041e\u0424-471) [[High explosive|HE]] projectiles, equipped with a 3.8&nbsp;kg [[TNT]] charge, would easily crack and could even completely tear off the front armor plate at the seam weld, blow off the turret and driver sprocket<ref name=\"books.google.com.vn\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&pg=PA41&dq=is-2+powerful&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVsremgMvSAhUIU7wKHaX5DswQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=is-2%20powerful&f=false The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II, Chris Bishop, P. 41]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}, mechanical shock and explosion was often enough to knock out enemy heavy tanks without any armor penetration<ref name=\"books.google.com.vn\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=RLjQDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=122mm+shell+effect&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=122mm%20shell%20effect&f=false Soviet Heavy Tanks: World War 2 In Review Special]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Surviving vehicles==\n[[File:Koenigstiger Saumur F.jpg|thumb|alt=The side of a large tank with wide, wavy green and grey striped camouflage, as it drives past, the commander sitting in the cupola.|The working Tiger II of the ''Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s'' being displayed to the public, 2005]]The only working example is displayed at the ''[[Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s]]'', [[Saumur]], France.

It was salvaged by the French Army in September 1944 and then stored in a factory in [[Satory]] before being transferred to the museum in 1975. Believed to have carried turret number 123, Colonel Michel Aubry, the founder of the museum, decided to put 233 on the turret in honour of the Tiger II that destroyed his Sherman tank at the end of the war. Unlike other captured German vehicles, this Tiger II was never used by the French Army.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://tank-photographs.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tiger-II-heavy-tank-Konigstiger.html |title = Surviving WW2 King Tiger II Ausf.

The ''Supergirl'', ''Batwoman'', and ''The Flash'' episodes aired in December 2019, while the ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episodes aired in January 2020. Additionally, events in the ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\", airing between ''Batwoman'' and ''The Flash'', and a two-issue comic featuring characters and concepts unable to appear in the live-action episodes, tie into the event.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", which is inspired by the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]], continues plotlines established in the previous crossover, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\". Moreover, the preceding episodes of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow'' season eight]] and much of [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash'' season six]] served as a prelude to the crossover. In \"Crisis\", the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] gathers [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]], the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]], and several \"Paragons\" from throughout the multiverse to stop the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] from destroying all of reality. The crossover's events resulted in the Arrowverse's continuity being [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]].\n\nInitial references to the crossover began in 2014, with [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''The Flash''. The adaptation began in earnest during the development of \"Elseworlds\", with the crossover title revealed at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in December 2018. In mid-2019, multiple castings were announced, including actors who previously portrayed DC characters in other media, such as [[Burt Ward]] and [[Kevin Conroy]]. \"Crisis\" also sees [[Cress Williams]] from fellow CW series ''Black Lightning'' appear and cross over with the Arrowverse for the first time, along with actors reprising their roles from various DC film and television series. Filming took place from the end of September 2019 until the beginning of November 2019.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Prelude===\nTo prepare for the coming Crisis, the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] recruits [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] and sends him on missions to collect various items.<ref name=\"ArrowFinale\" /> The former also retrieves the cadaver of [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]] and revives him.<ref name=\"SupergirlFinale\" /><ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /> [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] and [[Iris West (Arrowverse)|Iris West-Allen]] learn that the Crisis date has moved up to December 2019 and that to save billions, the Flash must die.<ref name=\"Flash601\" /> To learn more about what happens to him, Barry travels to [[Earth-3 (Arrowverse)|Earth-3]] to see [[Jay Garrick (Arrowverse)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Joan Williams (Arrowverse)|Joan Williams]], who have been tracking antimatter signatures across the multiverse.

As the Pierce family and [[Peter Gambi (Arrowverse)|Peter Gambi]] try to bring her back, the antimatter wave overtakes them while [[Jefferson Pierce (Arrowverse)|Jefferson Pierce]] is teleported away.<ref name=\"Black Lightning Crisis ep\">{{Cite episode |title=The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis |episode-link=The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis |series=Black Lightning |series-link=Black Lightning (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=3 |number=9 |airdate=December 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nAs the Crisis begins, the antimatter wave destroys countless parallel universes.{{efn|Some of these named on screen included: [[Earth-89 (Arrowverse)|Earth-89]], [[Earth-9 (Arrowverse)|Earth-9]], [[Earth-X (Arrowverse)|Earth-X]] and [[Earth-66 (Arrowverse)|Earth-66]].}} On [[Earth-38 (Arrowverse)|Earth-38]], [[Brainiac 5 (Arrowverse)|Brainiac 5]] detects the antimatter wave approaching [[Argo City (Arrowverse)|Argo City]], prompting [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Kara Danvers]] to warn her mother [[Alura Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Alura Zor-El]], her cousin [[Clark Kent (Arrowverse)|Clark Kent]], and his wife [[Lois Lane (Arrowverse)|Lois Lane]]. Clark and Lois narrowly send their son [[Jonathan Kent (Arrowverse)|Jonathan]] off into an escape pod just as the wave wipes out Argo alongside Alura. Harbinger brings Barry, [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Kate Kane]], [[Sara Lance]] and [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]] to Earth-38, while also rescuing the Kents from Argo. Harbinger briefs the gathered heroes on the threat of the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] as the Monitor raises a quantum tower to impede the antimatter wave while the [[Department of Extranormal Operations (Arrowverse)|DEO]] and [[Lena Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lena Luthor]] work to evacuate Earth-38's inhabitants to [[Earth-1 (Arrowverse)|Earth-1]]. Brainy locates Jonathan's pod on [[Earth-16 (Arrowverse)|Earth-16]], so he, Lois, and Sara leave to retrieve him while the others stay behind to fend off the Anti-Monitor's forces. In preparation for his death, Oliver passes the mantle of Green Arrow to Mia. When he learns Barry is fated to die however, he argues with the Monitor over the deal they made last year.{{efn|As depicted in the 2018 crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\".}} The heroes make their stand at the tower and fend off an army of shadow demons until the Monitor teleports them off-world, deeming the battle to be lost. Refusing to leave, Oliver temporarily nullifies the Monitor and stays behind to ensure the exodus succeeds. Back on Earth-1, Lois' team returns with Jonathan before the Monitor brings a dying Oliver to say good-bye, commenting that this was not how he was supposed to die. Nash, now a \"Pariah\" for releasing the Anti-Monitor, appears and announces that events have changed and everything is doomed.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 1 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part One |series=Supergirl |series-link=Supergirl (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=5 |number=9 |airdate=December 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the Earth-1 [[Legends of Tomorrow (Arrowverse team)|Legends]] unavailable, Harbinger recruits [[Earth-74 (Arrowverse)|Earth-74]]'s [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory]] so the heroes can use his ''Waverider'' as their base of operations. In the wake of Oliver's death, which he cannot undo because of the Anti-Monitor's growing power, the Monitor consults the Book of Destiny and learns of seven Paragons who could turn the tide; the \"Paragon of Hope\", Kara; the \"Paragon of Destiny\", Sara; the \"Paragon of Truth\", a Superman who has suffered \"more than any mortal man\"; and the \"Paragon of Courage\", who is described as the \"Bat of the Future\". Clark, Lois, and Iris locate the second Superman on [[Earth-96 (Arrowverse)|Earth-96]], though Lex uses the Book of Destiny to mind-control that Earth's Clark until Lois knocks Lex out. Kara and Kate travel to [[Earth-99 (Arrowverse)|Earth-99]], where the latter fails to recruit an elderly crippled [[Bruce Wayne (Arrowverse Earth-99)|Bruce Wayne]], who became a killer. Bruce is in turn accidentally electrocuted in a heated confrontation with Kate and Kara. Elsewhere on [[Earth-18 (Arrowverse)|Earth-18]], Sara, Barry, Mia, and [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]] take Oliver's body to a [[Lazarus Pit]] in an attempt to resurrect him, but the accumulating antimatter across the multiverse prevents them from bringing his soul back. Back on the ''Waverider'', the Monitor tasks Ray with building a \"Paragon detector\", which identifies Kate as the true \"Paragon of Courage\". Unbeknownst to everyone, Harbinger is secretly contacted by the Anti-Monitor.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 2 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Two |series=Batwoman |series-link=Batwoman (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=1 |number=9 |airdate=December 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]]'s help, Ray's \"Paragon detector\" identifies Barry as the \"Paragon of Love\", [[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]] as the \"Paragon of Honor\", and [[Ivy Town (Arrowverse)|Ivy Town]] scientist [[Ryan Choi (Arrowverse)|Ryan Choi]] as the \"Paragon of Humanity\". Iris, Ray, and [[Ralph Dibny (Arrowverse)|Ralph Dibny]] attempt to recruit a reluctant Choi, who eventually complies when Iris assures him that ordinary people can be heroes too. After the Monitor restores Cisco's powers, he, Barry, and [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] meet up with Pariah at the Anti-Monitor's chamber beneath Central City, where they find an anti-matter cannon powered by the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Flash]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]]. When Cisco frees Barry-90, the cannon goes critical, so Pariah recruits Jefferson from his recently-destroyed Earth to contain the energy. Barry-1 volunteers to destroy the cannon, which would result in his prophesied death. However, Barry-90 stops him, claiming the Monitor did not specify which Flash would die in the Crisis and takes his place. Meanwhile, Constantine, Mia, and Diggle visit [[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer]] on [[Earth-666 (Arrowverse)|Earth-666]] to get his help in entering [[Purgatory]] and retrieve Oliver's soul. Before they can leave, [[Jim Corrigan]] appears and bestows the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]'s power onto Oliver. He accepts, and Constantine's team is returned to the ''Waverider'' without him. While the heroes regroup, the Anti-Monitor sends a brainwashed Harbinger to kill the Monitor so he can absorb his power and finish destroying the multiverse. Before the remaining heroes and Earth-1 are destroyed, Pariah sends the Paragons to the Vanishing Point to keep them safe, where they witness Lex replace Superman-96 with himself using a page from the Book of Destiny.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 3 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Three |series=The Flash |series-link=The Flash (2014 TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=6 |number=9 |airdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn a flashback to the planet Maltus 10,000 years ago, Mar Novu experiments with time-travel to witness the birth of the universe, only to accidentally end up in the antimatter universe and reveal the multiverse's existence to the Anti-Monitor. In the months since the multiverse was destroyed, the Paragons have struggled to survive at the Vanishing Point. Once Corrigan teaches him how to use the Spectre's power, Oliver heads to the Vanishing Point to rescue the Paragons and strengthen Barry's powers. With his increased speed, Barry drops off Kara, Choi, and Lex on Maltus, but loses everyone else across the Speed Force after being attacked by the Anti-Monitor. Despite an expected double-cross from Lex, Kara and Choi convince Novu not to go through with his plans. Once Barry retrieves everyone, they arrive at the dawn of time, only to learn the Anti-Monitor will always learn of the multiverse's existence as there will always be a version of Novu who cannot give up his ambitions. The Paragons battle the Anti-Monitor and his shadow demons until Oliver uses the Spectre's power to restore the multiverse, with the Paragons providing additional assistance via Lex's Book of Destiny page. As a result however, Oliver dies a second and final time in Barry and Sara's arms.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 4 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Four |series=Arrow |series-link=Arrow (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=8 |number=8 |airdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWaking up in the newly-recreated universe, the Paragons discover they are the only ones who remember the Crisis and that both Earth-38 and Jefferson's Earth were merged with Earth-1 into a composite universe later designated as [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]], among other changes throughout the multiverse. While J'onn uses his psionic powers to bring their allies up to speed, Sara attempts to find Oliver, though without success. Later that night, the Paragons are attacked by shadow demons. A restored and remorseful Nash discovers that the Anti-Monitor is still alive and plotting to renew his destruction of the multiverse. To stop him once and for all, Nash, Ray, Barry, and Choi work to develop a bomb capable of shrinking the Anti-Monitor for eternity while the other heroes distract him. Once it is finished, Kara uses it on the Anti-Monitor, sending him to the microverse. Sometime later, Barry, Kara, Sara, Kate, Clark, J'onn, and Jefferson hold a memorial service for Oliver before agreeing to come together to protect their new world in his memory.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 5 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Five |series=Legends of Tomorrow |series-link=Legends of Tomorrow |network=[[The CW]] |season=5 |number=1 |airdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{further2|[[List of Supergirl characters|Supergirl]], [[List of Batwoman characters|Batwoman]], [[List of The Flash characters|The Flash]], [[List of Arrow characters|Arrow]], and [[List of Legends of Tomorrow characters|Legends of Tomorrow]] cast and characters}}\n\n===Main and recurring===\n<!--Ordered per WP:TVCAST.

Arrowverse in [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /> In September 2018, three months before the release of \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319]] [[Arrowverse]] crossover,<ref name=\"ElseworldsTitle\" /> ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' executive producer Phil Klemmer said \"people [were] already talking about\" the 2019 crossover, with it already having \"a loose shape\".<ref name=\"KlemmerSep2018\" /> In early December 2018, a week before the airing of \"Elseworlds\", ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' showrunner Beth Schwartz said the producers for all the series \"already know a lot about what's going on in next year's crossover,\"<ref name=\"SchwartzDec2018\" /> while [[Marc Guggenheim]] stated \"Elseworlds\" would \"lay the groundwork\" for the [[2019\u201320 United States network television schedule|2019\u201320 crossover]].<ref name=\"TVInsiderNov2018\" /> The end of \"Elseworlds\" revealed the crossover title and premise as \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", adapting the story from the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]].<ref name=\"CrisisOnInfiniteEarthsCrossover\" /> \"Elseworlds\" introduced the characters [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Mar Novu / Monitor]] and [[Psycho-Pirate (Arrowverse)|Psycho-Pirate]], and alluded to an impending \"crisis\".<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsSetUp\" />\n\nIn January 2019, ''The Flash'' showrunner [[Todd Helbing]] said the remainder of the [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]] would contain things in service of the forthcoming crossover.<ref name=\"HelbingJan2019\" /> At that time, [[The CW]] President [[Mark Pedowitz]] called the crossover \"the biggest, the most complicated one\" to date, and was hopeful ''Legends of Tomorrow'', which did not participate in \"Elseworlds\" because of production complications, would be part of \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"PedowitzJan2019\" /> When pitching the crossover to the studio and network early on, Guggenheim noted the creators stressed they did not want the event to be \"Crisis on CW Earths\", but to have the ability \"to touch as many strands of the DC tapestry as possible.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" />\n\nIn May 2019, Pedowitz announced at The CW's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation that the crossover would include ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', and ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'' in a five-episode event, spanning dates in both late 2019 and early 2020.<ref name=\"CrisisTwoQuarters\" /> The crossover occurred in the ninth episodes of [[Supergirl (season 5)|''Supergirl''{{'}}s fifth season]],<ref name=\"SupergirlEpisodeNumber\" /> [[Batwoman (TV series)|''Batwoman''{{'}}s first season]],<ref name=\"BatwomanPreCrisis\" /> and [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash''{{'}}s sixth season]],<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> in the eighth episode of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season]],<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" /> and as a special episode of the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|''Legends of Tomorrow''{{'}}s fifth season]]; this episode is not considered the series' season premiere.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Speaking to the comparison of the crossover to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), Guggenheim felt \"for [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry]] and [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]], there is an emotional denouement that is reminiscent of ''Endgame''\" adding, \"''Endgame'' is an exclamation point. \"Crisis\" is a semi-colon.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\n===Lead-up===\nIn May 2019, the season finales of ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''Supergirl'', and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' all featured teases for the upcoming crossover, with the Monitor making an appearance in all series except ''The Flash''.<ref name=\"SeasonFinaleTeases\" /> Eric Wallace, showrunner of the sixth season of ''The Flash'', stated that when all the series' showrunners discussed plans for their series before the crossover, \"all of this synergy started to happen\" with \"a lot of cross collaboration\" in service to the crossover events. Wallace felt the themes of grief, death, and the end of all worlds in \"Crisis\" worked with the story they were trying to tell with the villain [[Ramsey Rosso (Arrowverse)|Ramsey Rosso / Bloodwork]], \"who is facing the end of his own world\". This allowed the start of season six of ''The Flash'' to help set up the crossover.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> The majority of ''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season serves as a prelude to the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettArrowS8Prelude\" /> The ''Arrow'' writers consulted with ''The Flash'' writers regarding the destruction of [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]] in \"[[Starling City (Arrow episode)|Starling City]]\" to ensure they could destroy this Earth.<ref name=\"Earth2Destroyed\" /> On ''Supergirl'', co-showrunner [[Robert Rovner]] said the season would tease the crossover \"in our way, which is a little bit different from the way ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' are doing it.\" He also highlighted the return of [[Malefic J'onzz (Arrowverse)|Malefic]], [[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]]'s brother, as a major plot thread leading to the crossover, describing it as \"a gauntlet for J'onn\".<ref name=\"SupergirlEPsSep2019\" /> [[LaMonica Garrett]], who portrays both the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor, said before the crossover, the Anti-Monitor's \"presence [would] be felt before you physically see him,\" adding, \"You see just enough of him to know this guy means business, but it's not in your face in every scene leading up to\" the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> The preceding episodes of ''Batwoman'', ''Supergirl'', ''The Flash'', and ''Arrow'' featured an end tag scene with [[Nash Wells]] gaining access to the chamber under Central City.<ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /><ref name=\"Flash608\" /><ref name=\"Arrow807Tag\" /><!--<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> can source all episodes having the tag, if needed. -->\n\n===Tie-ins===\nThe ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" tied in to \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", ahead of [[Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jefferson Pierce]] first appearing in ''The Flash'' episode of the crossover. The episode saw red skies cover Freeland before anti-matter strikes [[Jennifer Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jennifer Pierce]], sending her to a void where she finds her Earth-1 and 2 counterparts. An anti-matter wave eventually wipes them out, along with her Earth, except for Jefferson, who is teleported to an unknown location.<ref name=\"BlackLightning309\" />\n\nThe crossover story was expanded in a two-issue comics series, ''Crisis on Infinite Earths Giant'', written by [[Marv Wolfman]], the writer of the 1985 original series, and Guggenheim and illustrated by Tom Derenick, Trevor Scott, [[John Kalisz]], Andy Owens, Hi-Fi, [[Tom Grummett]], Danny Miki, and [[Chris Sotomayor]].<ref name=\"ComicsGiantDC\" /> The issues also reprinted material from the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' comic, with the second issue including material from ''DC Universe: Legacies'' #6 (2010). Speaking to the issues, Guggenheim said their conception \"came pretty early on in the process\" once it was realized the scope of the story would be more than the five episodes. By creating the comics, it allowed the producers to utilize \"all of the characters that we don't have in the crossover proper for logistical reasons, or financial reasons, or creative reasons{{nbsp}}... [The comics] allows us to tell a major piece of the story that we're designing, with characters and concepts that we couldn't achieve in live action.\" The four main characters of the comic are [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]], the [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray]], [[Nyssa al Ghul (Arrowverse)|Nyssa al Ghul]], and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West]], in addition to appearances by [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Atom]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], the Flash,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> the Monitor, [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]], and others.<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Serious consideration was given to include the [[Huntress (Arrowverse)|Huntress]], but Guggenheim opted for Nyssa al Ghul instead because \"we had done [[Arrow: Season 2.5|a comic book tie-in]] that bridged [[Arrow (season 2)|seasons two]] and [[Arrow (season 3)|three]] of ''Arrow'' and [Huntress] had featured prominently in that, so Nyssa had not yet had her chance to be immortalized that way.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Wolfman added that the comics were \"created to tie in perfectly with the CW shows\" so it felt like a main part of the story and not ancillary,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> adding, \"This is integral to the entire storyline.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> The first comic debuted exclusively in [[Walmart]] stores on December 15, 2019, with the second releasing on January 19, 2020, and releases in comic stores the month after.<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> The events of the comics occur during the first part of the ''Batwoman'' episode of the crossover.<ref name=\"ComicsGiantTwitter\" /> The stories from both issues, plus behind-the-scenes extra, will be collected in a deluxe edition hardcover, set for release on May 6, 2020.<ref name=\"ComicsHardCover\" />\n\n===Writing===\nEach part of the crossover was written by the following creative teams. The ''Supergirl'' episode was written by Derek Simon and [[Jay Faerber]] with [[Robert Rovner]] and Guggenheim contributing the story,<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson wrote the ''Batwoman'' episode,<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> and Lauren Certo and Sterling Gates wrote ''The Flash'' episode, with Eric Wallace conceiving the story.<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> The ''Arrow'' episode was co-written by Wolfman and Guggenheim,<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode was written by [[Keto Shimizu]] and Ubah Mohamed.<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" />\n\nThe writers gathered for a two-week session to write the crossover. Guggenheim, who was the overall creative for \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", began by creating \"a series of big tentpole beats that could happen in each of the five hours\". These moments were designed to be modular, meaning they could be moved between the episodes depending on each series' creative needs, the scheduling of actors, and other factors. This also helped determine the order each episode aired. Guggenheim's initial template was catered to ''Arrow'' being the fourth hour and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' being the fifth \"because in crossovers past, ''Legends'' has always been the finale of the crossover.\" The CW then requested for ''The Flash'' to be the third hour, and after working \"out those tentpoles, for a variety of different plot reasons, it made a lot of sense for the first hour to be ''Supergirl''\", leaving ''Batwoman'' as the second hour.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Within this, certain characters were considered \"integral\", while others would just make cameo appearances, should that actor be available to appear.<ref name=\"GuggenheimRollingStoneDec2019\" /> With the large moments determined, the individual writers then broke off to write each episode, before the group reconvened to review the whole, making adjustments and moving moments as necessary. Each series' writers would work on their title character's scenes (for example, Supergirl's scenes on ''Batwoman'' were written by the ''Supergirl'' writers) to ensure consistency. The story is considered \"a five-hour epic\" as opposed to individual episodes, but the title character of each series and characters appropriate for those worlds (such as [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Barry Allen]] of Earth-90 appearing on ''The Flash''), were given highlights.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> The episodes' scripts were completed by early September 2019.<ref name=\"Scripts\" />\n\nGuggenheim stated the crossover would try to incorporate \"seminal moments\" from the comic book, with the opening of the Arrowverse crossover showing the destruction of various parallel universes similarly to the comic's beginning.<ref name=\"GuggenheimSeminalMoments\" /> Speaking to the deaths of Supergirl and the Flash from the comic storyline, Wallace conceded that the writers \"can't just kill all of our number ones on our shows\" but a proper balance was found in killing some.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> Though it was revealed in \"Elseworlds\" that Oliver would die in the crossover, which Guggenheim felt \"spoiled our own story\", his death in the first hour was done in an attempt to \"surprise the audience\" who may have expected him to die in the fifth. It was also done to \"establish the stakes going into the next four hours\".<ref name=\"OliverDeathEW\" /> In the third hour, the death of Barry Allen from Earth-90 was \"a way to honor what was said [by] the Monitor {{nbsp}}... saying the Flash must die\" without killing Gustin's character. Wallace thought this gave \"it a nice story twist, [to] get in some emotion\" while also \"complet[ing] a 30-year arc\" for [[John Wesley Shipp]]'s character. The flashback scene from the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990 ''Flash'' television series]] was not originally scripted for inclusion, but was added while editing the episode \"to give a little bit of his life flashing before his eyes\".<ref name=\"Flash90Death\" /> Oliver dies for a second time at the end of the ''Arrow'' episode. Once again, this was done to \"[surprise] the audience with the unexpected\" according to Guggenheim, adding, \"I think <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Stephen Amell]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> enjoyed A) the opportunity to play two death scenes and B) the creative sleight of hand in terms of surprising the audience.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nThe original comic was created to help with [[DC Comics]]' continuity problems, but since the Arrowverse does not have those, the crossover allowed the creators to focus on the characters and their interactions. Supergirl and Batwoman's relationship was further developed, after being teased at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in a way that \"those two characters [are] supporting each other much in the same way that Barry and Oliver have been supporting each other in previous crossovers.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" /> For scenes set in [[Gotham City]], ''Batwoman'' showrunner Caroline Dries ensured the grounded tone of the series was kept to since it is \"not normal for [the characters of ''Batwoman''] to interact with aliens and travel to different universes\".<ref name=\"DriesTCA\" /> The version of the Anti-Monitor that appears was also inspired by the character's appearance in the [[New 52]] \"Darkseid Wars\" storyline.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> [[Sara Lance]] is the focus of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' characters, with the crossover \"kick[ing] off Sara's emotional journey for season 5 of ''Legends''\" and giving Sara \"a different perspective on things.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" /> Though the early allusions to \"Crisis\" on ''The Flash'' mentioned the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and [[Tom Cavanagh]] was said to be reprising the role in the crossover,<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /><ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /> the character did not make an appearance. Guggenheim did not want to be beholden to this, pointing out that the newspaper headline mentioning him had been created by executives no longer involved with the series or this crossover. The character had also already featured prominently in previous crossovers.<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Psycho-Pirate, included in \"Elseworlds\", was another character that appeared in early versions of the crossover. Ultimately, per Guggenheim, he was not included since \"given the story we were telling, the only reason we were having him in there was because he was in the original comic\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" />\n\nWith the inclusion of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] from ''[[Smallville]]'' in the crossover, it explored what happened to the characters after ''Smallville'' ended.<ref name=\"Durance\" /> [[Erica Durance]], who portrays that series' Lois Lane, said, \"It's a little bit of a look into their future and the different choices they've made to be together. It's a full-circle moment that's really nice.\" Guggenheim pointed out that the ''Batwoman'' episode where the characters appear was written by former writers on ''Smallville''. This allowed Guggenheim to \"[step] aside and let them speak to where things were headed. As a fan of the show, it answered a lot of questions that I had. It provided a lot of closure, I think, in a really nice way.\" The ''Smallville'' material in the crossover was shared with ''Smallville'' co-creator [[Alfred Gough]] before filming began.<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Despite having three actors who portray Clark Kent / Superman in the crossover, there was never a scene written featuring all three. The writers wanted a clear distinction of Welling's character appearing at the Kent Farm, with Routh's character appearing at the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. Guggenheim added, \"The desire to have multiple Supermen [together] is what inspired the backup story\" in the comic tie-in.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> Appearing as [[Bruce Wayne]] in live-action for the first time allowed [[Kevin Conroy]] to \"explore a lot of [the] dark corners\" of the character in a different way than when he voiced an older version of the character in the animated series ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" />\n\n[[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer Morningstar]]'s appearance was considered to be five years before the events of ''[[Lucifer (TV series)|Lucifer]]'', according to actor [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]], who added, \"This is him in his proper playboy, don't-give-a-damn-about-anything stage in his life. He is very irreverent with our characters when they turn up in the scene and obviously, with [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|Constantine]], there is some history there.\"<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> His scene was written by Certo, a fan of ''Lucifer'', and was sent to the creative team on ''Lucifer'' for their feedback. ''Lucifer'' co-showrunner Joe Henderson suggested Lucifer's flirting joke, while Ellis contributed the bit of him saying \"Constantyne\" instead of \"Constantine\". Henderson called Lucifer's appearance \"the coolest thing\" since he wanted to participate once he knew the Arrowverse series were adapting ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.<ref name=\"EWLuciferShowrunners\" /> The inclusion of Black Lightning in the crossover was decided \"very late in the game\" according to Guggenheim. He worked closely with ''Black Lightning'' showrunner [[Salim Akil]] to figure out a way to incorporate the character in a way that would not be a simple cameo but \"in a way that feels significant\". Once the logistics and creative elements were solved, having the character \"elevated the crossover to another level\". On the character's appearance, actor [[Cress Williams]] stated the character's entrance comes \"in a very surprising way. He's not prepared for it. So, he doesn't know these people.\" Williams added that because of this, there is \"some conflict early on when he's trying to figure out, who are you people and why am I here?\".<ref name=\"BlackLightningEWNov2019\" />\n\nBarry's journey through the Speed Force in the ''Arrow'' hour was an opportunity for the writers to \"revisit a series 'greatest hits' for Oliver, key moments in terms of his relationships{{nbsp}}... it\u2019s a little bit of a 'Before you die, your life flashes before your eyes' kind of feel\"; it was important to the writers that they could \"look backwards before Oliver's death.\" Oliver and Diggle's fight in the [[Arrow (season 6)|season six]] episode \"[[Brothers in Arms (Arrow)|Brothers in Arms]]\" was originally planned for Kate's scene in the Speed Force, with Kate helping to break up the fight. The writers felt season six was \"relatively recent\", so they chose \"[[Suicidal Tendencies (Arrow)|Suicidal Tendencies]]\" from [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]]. This episode, one of Guggenheim's favorites, and the argument between Oliver and Ray helped show \"how much all of the shows have evolved and relationships between the characters have evolved.\" The other moments in the Speed Force were also chosen based on \"showing how far the characters have come\". While in the Speed Force, Barry encountered [[Ezra Miller]]'s [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen]] from the [[DC Extended Universe]]. Guggenheim worked with DC Comics' Chief Creative Officer [[Jim Lee]] and DC Entertainment's film vice president Adam Schlagman on the scene to ensure it would not conflict with the planned [[The Flash (film)|''Flash'' film]].<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" />\n\nThe end of the crossover sees Barry converting the old [[S.T.A.R. Labs (Arrowverse)|S.T.A.R. Labs]] hangar seen in the \"[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion!]]\" crossover to a spot where the heroes could gather for future team-ups,<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> along with a hint at a possible introduction of [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] and the [[Wonder Twins]]. These hints were a \"fun bit\" the writers knew they wanted to end the crossover on, with an early version of the scripts having the Wonder Twins make an appearance.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> Guggenheim had tried to have [[Swamp Thing]] appear to interact with Constantine, given their history and relationship in the comics. This was \"a really important inclusion\" for Guggenheim, but \"for a variety of different reasons,\" it could not happen.<ref name=\"SwampThing\" />\n\n===Casting===\nLaMonica Garrett was upgraded to series regular status on all of the series, receiving the credit in the episodes he appears in before the crossover, to ensure he would have been available for \"Crisis\" and his appearances leading up to it.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> In July 2019 at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], multiple castings for the crossover were announced. They included: [[Tyler Hoechlin]] reprising his role as [[Superman (Arrowverse)|Superman]],<ref name=\"HoechlinRouthSuperman\" /> while [[Brandon Routh]], who portrays Ray Palmer / Atom in the Arrowverse, would reprise his role as Superman from the film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006), portraying \"an older, more world-weary\" version, inspired by the [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|''Kingdom Come'' Superman]];<ref name=\"RouthKingdomCome\" /><ref name=\"RouthSupermanClarify\" /><ref name=\"/FilmTCAAug2019\" /> Tom Cavanagh would portray [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]] in addition to Nash Wells;<ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /><ref name=\"NashWells\" /> [[Burt Ward]], who portrayed [[Dick Grayson|<!-- don't delink -->Dick Grayson / Robin]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s Batman television series]], would appear in an undisclosed role;<ref name=\"Ward\" /> Amell portraying multiple versions of Oliver Queen;<ref name=\"MultipleOliverQueens\" /> [[Jon Cryer]] reprising his role as Lex Luthor;<ref name=\"LexLuthor\" /> and Garrett also portraying the Anti-Monitor in addition to the Monitor.<ref name=\"AntiMonitor\" /> Shortly after, [[Elizabeth Tulloch]] was also confirmed to be reprising her role as [[Lois Lane (Arrowverse)|Lois Lane]].<ref name=\"Tulloch\" />\n\nThe following month, at the [[Television Critics Association]], Pedowitz announced that cast members from the series ''Black Lightning'' would appear,<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> something star Cress Williams previously hinted at,<ref name=\"CressWilliamsTease\" /> and that Kevin Conroy would appear as an elderly Bruce Wayne, having previously voiced the character in multiple animated media.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Conroy \"jumped at\" the opportunity to portray the character in live action, having not done it previously. He also felt it would be an opportunity to satisfy the \"loyal\" fanbase of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', who also expressed interest in seeing Conroy portray the character on camera.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" /> Guggenheim also revealed the producers discussed with DC and Warner Bros. about the possibility of having [[Lynda Carter]] reprise her role as [[Wonder Woman]] from the [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|television series]], but felt it was unlikely to happen.<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" />\n\nIn September, [[Johnathon Schaech]] was confirmed to be reprising his role as [[Jonah Hex (Arrowverse)|Jonah Hex]],<ref name=\"JonahHex\" /> and shortly after [[John Wesley Shipp]] was cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Shipp\" /> Around this time, Tom Ellis was approached to appear as Lucifer Morningstar from the series ''Lucifer''. Working on his series, Ellis \"talked over the years about Lucifer being a DC character and, 'Is there any chance of this happening?'\", feeling \"Crisis\" was a good chance to explore that connection for the character.<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> In the middle of the month, it was announced that [[Tom Welling]] and Erica Durance would reprise their roles as Clark Kent and Lois Lane, respectively, from ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"Welling\" /><ref name=\"Durance\" /> Durance also returns to reprise her Arrowverse role as [[Alura Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Alura Zor-El]].<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]], who portrayed [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] on ''Smallville'', revealed Warner Bros. and the producers approached him to reprise the role in \"Crisis\", but he ultimately declined.<ref name=\"RosenbaumApproached\" /> [[Alan Ritchson]], who played [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry/Aquaman]] on ''Smallville'', was also approached to reprise his role in the crossover but he turned it down due to his scheduling conflicts with the series ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]''.<ref name=\"Ritchson\" /> Later in the month, [[Osric Chau]] was cast as [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]] and [[Ashley Scott]] was confirmed to be reprising her role as [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Kyle / Huntress]] from the series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.<ref name=\"Chau\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" /> At the start of October, [[Audrey Marie Anderson]] was announced to be reprising her role as [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]], while also taking on the [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]] persona from the comics; Lyla previously used \"Harbinger\" as her [[A.R.G.U.S.]] codename.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> The same month, [[Stephen Lobo]] was cast as [[Jim Corrigan]].<ref name=\"Lobo\" /> By that time, the producers had reached out to [[Nicolas Cage]], who at one point was attached to portray Superman in the planned ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]'' film, about appearing.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\"/>\n\nAt the end of November, it was reported that [[Brec Bassinger]] would appear in the crossover as [[Courtney Whitmore|<!--don't delink-->Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]], ahead of the release of [[Stargirl (TV series)|her series]] on the streaming service [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] later in 2020.<ref name=\"Stargirl\" /> [[Ezra Miller]] appeared in the ''Arrow'' episode reprising his [[DC Extended Universe]] role of Barry Allen, after [[Warner Bros. Television]] president [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] spoke to Guggenheim about including him. Despite production on the crossover being completed, Guggenheim approached Gustin to see if he would be \"on-board\" with Miller appearing, not wanting to do it if Gustin was not, and Gustin \"was incredibly enthusiastic\" with the idea.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> Guggenheim also called Jim Lee \"instrumental in making [the cameo] happen\".<ref name=\"EzraMiller\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction for \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began on September 24, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> Filming at the farmhouse for the Kent family farm took place at the end of the month.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /> The farmhouse had previously been featured in the \"Elseworlds\" crossover and on ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsKentFarm\" /> Production for the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode began on October 4.<ref name=\"LegendsProduction\" /> Williams took a break from filming ''Black Lightning'' in [[Atlanta]] to spend a week filming his parts of the crossover in [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"WilliamsFilming\" /> His scenes were reviewed by the crew of ''Black Lightning'' to ensure his characterization was consistent with his series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Filming had completed by November 8, with some reshoots and minor filming having finished by December 19.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnd2\" /> Once Miller's cameo was finalized, a small crew from ''The Flash'' was used to film it since the ''Arrow'' crew had already wrapped on the series and was no longer around.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nDirectors on the crossover included [[Jesse Warn]] (''Supergirl''),<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Laura Belsey (''Batwoman''),<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> David McWhirter (''The Flash''),<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> [[Glen Winter]] (''Arrow''),<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] (''Legends of Tomorrow'').<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" /> These directors were hired specifically for the crossover, because of their previous experience working in the Arrowverse, allowing them to create a unified look, with help from their directors of photography. ''Batwoman'', which normally is filmed in a different [[aspect ratio]] than the other series, used the same ratio as the other series for a consistent look. Many of the stunt sequences, particularly in the ''Supergirl'' and ''Arrow'' episodes, were filmed with drones.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Blake Neely]], along with his collaborators Nathaniel Blume, Sherri Chung, and Daniel Chan, began work on the crossover on November 20, 2019,<ref name=\"ScoreStart\" /> with the score recorded by a live orchestra on December 2.<ref name=\"ScoreRecording\" /><ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> [[Tony Kanal]] and [[Stephen Perkins]] were featured performers on the score.<ref name=\"ScorePerformers\" /> Neely incorporated many musical [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] into his score, some of which were \"cues the production has attempted to obtain the rights to for years\";<ref name=\"ScoreEasterEggs\" /> some cues included the 1960s Batman television series theme,<ref name=\"60sBatmanTheme\" /> the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] theme,<ref name=\"89BatmanTheme\" /> \"hints\" of the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' theme, the march theme and \"Can You Read My Mind?\" from the [[Superman (1978 film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]],<ref name=\"Part2EasterEggs\" /> the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990s ''Flash'' television series]] theme,<ref name=\"Part3EasterEggs\" /> and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' theme.<ref name=\"TVLineFinaleRecap\" />\n\n===Effect on the Arrowverse===\nAhead of the crossover, Guggenheim told each of the series' showrunners \"there's an opportunity here to introduce some major status quo shift[s]\" if they desired, and it was something each series \"have embraced\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Guggenheim described it as \"it wasn't so much a burden of fixing something, it was the freedom of being able to change whatever we wanted to change.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> He added that each series would be affected, outside of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', since \"the crossover launches much of that season\" though there would be \"one rather big ramification\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Coming out of the crossover, Dries was looking to \"make Kate's life a little bit more integrated with all of this madness of sci-fi and aliens, and the dense mythology between\" the other series, but still keep the grounded nature established earlier in ''Batwoman''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> However, this was \"a little tricky because our characters aren\u2019t yet exposed to this notion of multiple universes, superheroes, powers, and stuff.\"<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> An action by Barry would have ramifications for the remainder of ''The Flash''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> The goal of the crossover for Wallace was to \"tap into that feeling that the readers in 1985 would have had, when reading that story, with the tectonic shifts in the comic world, underneath\" and felt the Arrowverse ending was a \"game-changer\" that \"opens up to a whole new world\".<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nBy the end of the crossover, the universe had been rebooted, with all of the CW series airing at the time{{Snd}}''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', ''Supergirl'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ''Batwoman'', and ''Black Lightning''{{Snd}}now existing on the newly established Earth-Prime; this was decided going into the crossover. A new multiverse was also created, with six of its Earths revealed.<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> Guggenheim said \"there is an opportunity going forward after \"Crisis\" to slowly reveal all of the weird changes,\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> with each series \"get[ing] the chance to tell a piece of that story.\"<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Some of the changes include John Diggle and Lyla Michaels' daughter Sara returning to the timeline after being changed in [[Flashpoint (Arrowverse)|Flashpoint]], and Lex Luthor having more heroic qualities. Returning baby Sara was \"very important\" to Guggenheim and Schwartz to accomplish in \"Crisis\" after almost doing so in \"Elseworlds\"; it was held off until this crossover because they \"thought it had more punch if it was a part of the universal reboot\". ''Supergirl'' showrunners Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller came to Guggenheim with the idea to alter Lex Luthor, something they \"were all really excited about\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> For ''Batwoman'', the series sees Kate's sister [[Beth Kane|Beth]] return as a separate person from the season's antagonist Alice,<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> with Dries calling this a \"shocking resonance\" for the series.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crisis-on-Infinite-Earths-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo without Oliver Queen]\n| image2 = [https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/crisis-final-logo-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo with Oliver Queen]\n}}\nThe first teaser for the crossover was released on November 10, 2019.<ref name=\"FirstTeaserCast\" /> [[Boost Mobile]] served as a promotional partner for the event.<ref name=\"FirstTeaser\" /> On November 15, The CW released a series of show-specific teaser shorts.<ref name=\"SupergirlShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"BatwomanShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"FlashShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"ArrowShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"LegendsShortTeaser\" /> A week later, the poster for the event was released.<ref name=\"PosterReleased\" /> On November 24, 2019, a full trailer was released.<ref name=\"FullTrailer\" /> A first long trailer for the event was released on December 3, 2019,<ref name=\"FirstLongTrailer\" /> and a second on December 6, 2019.<ref name=\"SecondLongTrailer\" />\n\nWith the release of the initial trailers in November, a logo for the event featuring the leading character from each of the series except Oliver Queen was revealed. Guggenheim claimed that, at that time, legal and financial reasons prevented them from including Amell's character in the logo.<ref name=\"LogoNoOliver\" /> However, with the release of the full trailer in December, Oliver was now included in the logo, which Guggenheim explained was due to \"the creativity of a lot of very smart people\" and \"a loophole\" to allow the change to happen.<ref name=\"LogoWithOliver\" /><ref name=\"LogoWithOliverLoophole\" /> After the crossover concluded, Guggenheim said he had been told \"only actors appearing in all five hours could be in the main title card\", hence the initial exclusion of Amell because he does not appear in Part 5.<ref name=\"LogoOliverExplaination\" />\n\nA week before the final two episodes aired, a second poster for the crossover was released. Russ Burlingame of Comicbook.com said the poster was \"a mirror to the first \"Crisis\" poster, but centering on darkness rather than light\", with different taglines used, and \"the Anti-Monitor standing with his hands raised up and pointed down, whereas The Monitor had stood with his palms up and arms at his sides.\"<ref name=\"ComicbookNewPoster\" /> On January 10, 2020, Amell released a final trailer for the last two parts.<ref name=\"FinalTrailer\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\nThe crossover began with ''Supergirl'' on December 8, 2019, continuing with ''Batwoman'' on December

response===\n====''Supergirl''====\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 100% approval rating, based on 13 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"TV's biggest crossover manages to tie these different universes together, offering plenty of cameos, dramatic moments, and surprising twists that will shake the Arrowverse forever.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supergirl/s05/e09|title=Supergirl \u2013 Season 5 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] gave the first hour a 9 out of 10. He called the episode \"accessible\" for any viewer and felt it did not \"lose sight of the personal and emotional stakes of this conflict\". Schedeen also felt the ''Supergirl'' supporting cast was \"utilized well\". The episode was also deemed \"a very critical episode for ''Arrow'' fans\" given Oliver's death by Schedeen, though he was upset that Barry did not have a large role to play in the episode.<ref name=\"IGNSupergirlReview\" /> Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sara Netzley said \"no amount of watching, reading, and speculating [could] truly [prepare]us for the heroism, the tears, the sacrifice, and the cameos\" of the episode.<ref name=\"EWSupergirlReview\" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Caroline Siede called the opening of the episode \"some of the most exhilarating superhero TV I've ever seen\". Siede was happy \"Crisis\" was the first crossover \"to deliver an episode that feels like a meaningful part of the crossover {{em|and}} a meaningful part of ''Supergirl'' as well.\" She also pointed out the scene between Kara and Clark discussing Argo City's destruction felt \"like ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' and its 'Asgard is not a place, it's a people' ethos\". She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubSupergirlReview\" /> Awarding the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars, Kayti Burt from ''[[Den of Geek]]'' called Oliver's death \"a massively gutsy storytelling move\" and overall, felt the episode \"set the stakes for the crossover journey to come.\" Speaking to the cast in the episode, Burt said, \"By keeping the ensemble in this part of the story relatively small, we were able to spend more time with all of them, not to mention check in with the characters who are ''Supergirl''-specific,\" which led to \"one of the best scenes\" between Alex and Lena.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekSupergirlReview\" />\n\n====''Batwoman''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 92% approval rating, based on 12 reviews for the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/batwoman/s01/e09|title=Batwoman \u2013 Season 1 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen called the episode \"a superhero nerd's dream come true\" since it \"doubles down on the emotional character drama and manages to deliver some of the best live-action Superman moments in a very long time.\" Schedeen noted the ''Smallville'' moments were the \"epilogue fans deserve\", but conceded some fans would not have enjoyed them and praised Routh as \"a solid Superman and a downright terrific Clark Kent\". He added the second hour was less plot-driven and the crossover could be \"moving too slowly for its own good\", but preferred it \"prioritizing the character moments over the plot and spectacle\". Speaking to the Lazarus Pit subplot in the episode, Schedeen deemed it \"an unnecessary addition to an already crowded crossover\". He gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNBatwomanReview\" /> Chancellor Agard at ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the episode a \"B+\" saying \"''Batwoman''{{'}}s Part 2 of the crossover succeeds where Part 1 stumbled a bit. Yes, tonight's episode was just as busy (and cameo-filled), but it flowed smoothly and all of the important beats landed.\" Agard credited the simple task of the heroes searching for the Paragons as to why the episode worked so well. Conroy's appearance was \"truly something,\" according to Agard. He also was one of the fans \"letdown\" by the ''Smallville'' moments, but it eventually made sense to him because \"''Smallville'' was always about Clark Kent [and] his desire to live a normal life despite his powers\".<ref name=\"EWBatwomanReview\" /> Alani Vargas of ''The A.V. Club'' felt \"the writers did a great job of weaving in some of the most famous versions of Superman\" into the episode, though she did note that other characters and elements from ''Batwoman'' got \"the short end of the stick\" in the crossover; she gave the episode a \"B\".<ref name=\"AVClubBatwomanReview\" /> ''Den of Geek''{{'}}s Delia Harrington gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekBatwomanReview\" />\n\n====''The Flash''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 11 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An emotional episode that packs a surprising punch, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" sets the stage for a heartbreaking winter premiere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash/s06/e09|title=The Flash \u2013 Season 6 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen felt \"the cracks are definitely starting to show\" with ''The Flash'' episode, highlighting the number of new characters introduced to the story along with all the plot needed to be covered in this hour. Specifically, he felt Ryan Choi's introduction could have happened before the crossover to \"get some of the backstory out of the way\", and the purgatory storyline \"deserved far more attention\" than the episode was able to give, despite Schedeen being \"very much behind\" Oliver becoming the Spectre. Schedeen was able to see some of the production limitations, commenting on how it was obvious to him some scenes did not have all actors filming together. Despite all this, \"this episode never loses sight of the core appeal of Crisis\" giving characters \"their big moments and celebrating the connections these characters have forged.\" Schedeen praised Earth-90 Flash's sacrifice, the way Black Lightning was introduced to the Arrowverse, Blake Neely's score, and the Lucifer cameo, ultimately giving the episode an 8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNFlashReview\" /> Agard said with the Earth-90 Flash's death, the episode achieved the \"clever way to save Grant Gustin from that fate while also wrapping up that thread in a way that was satisfying and didn't feel like a complete cheat\". He was also glad that J'onn J'onnz and Iris West were having more substantial roles in the crossover than previous ones in which they had been sidelined or underutilized. To Agard, the introduction of Black Lightning was \"the definition of delayed gratification. Seeing Cress interact with everyone in this scene was something to behold because we've been waiting for it to happen and, more importantly, the script does a good job of synthesizing who this guy is to non-''Black Lightning'' viewers.\" Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", Agard concluded, \"Overall, I kind of loved this episode. Sure, it definitely moved a bit too quickly and I lost track of the story at times. But it had an immense heart to it. Not only that, but it also improved on what Part 2 did.\"<ref name=\"EWFlashReview\" />\n\n''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Scott Von Doviak also awarded the episode an \"A\u2013\", saying the crossover is \"a hot mess, there's no question about it. To call it overstuffed would be an understatement{{nbsp}}... There are five-minute subplots here that could have been entire episodes of the various series making up the Arrowverse, and the whole thing feels like it could fly apart like the Flash on the cosmic treadmill at any moment. But that's what makes it so much fun.\" Von Doviak called the purgatory subplot one of the ones that felt rushed, and the killing of Earth-90 Flash made \"all the angst of the first half of the season feel a little cheap\". As for the episode's ending, Von Doviak said it was \"kind of a ripoff of ''Avengers: Infinity War''\" especially since he predicted all of it would be reversed in the final installments, \"but as far as cliffhangers to hold us until after the holidays go, it'll do.\"<ref name=\"AVClubFlashReview\" /> Awarding the episode 5 out of 5 stars, Mike Cecchini from ''Den of Geek'' felt the crossover and this episode succeeded in \"deliver[ing] 100+ episodes worth of emotional and narrative payoff\" and being \"the climax of the single most ambitious crossover in television history\".<ref name=\"DenOfGeekFlashReview\" />\n\n====''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 79% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the ''Arrow'' episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"{{'}}s fourth installment reshuffles the universe in rousing fashion thanks to ''Arrow'' himself and a delightful cameo from Ezra Miller, even if repeating the same sacrifice twice dilutes the impact of this farewell to Oliver Queen.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arrow/s08/e08|title=Arrow \u2013 Season 8 Episode 8|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref> For the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 5 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/dc_s_legends_of_tomorrow/s05/e01|title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow \u2013 Season 5 Episode 1|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen gave the final two installments a 9 out of 10 saying, \"The final two chapters of 'Crisis on Infinite Earths' cement this crossover as the most entertaining and most ambitious Arrowverse adventure yet.\" After fearing the crossover would buckle under its weight in Part 3, Schedeen was glad in the ''Arrow'' episode that the \"consolidating [of] the cast down to a handful of heroes and a few cosmic entities really help[ed] refocus and remind viewers of what's at stake.\" He also liked seeing the human side of the Monitor, but could not say the same for the Anti-Monitor, who was just \"a faceless threat and an obligatory, all-powerful punching bag in these final two episodes.\" Schedeen called Oliver's sacrifice \"a fitting end\" to the character stating, \"These final two episodes more than justify the decision to resurrect Ollie after his heroic sacrifice in Part 1. They do even more to bring the character full circle and complete his arc. Ollie's story has always been about the sacrifices he makes for the greater good and what better way to end that story than by having the Arrowverse's first hero give his life so that its best heroes can continue the fight?\" For the ''Legends'' episode, he felt the \"finale manages to deftly balance the whimsical, self-aware tone of ''Legends'' with the gravitas needed as our heroes confront the Anti-Monitor one last time.\" Schedeen also added Part 5 \"manages to juggle its many moving parts elegantly\" and he enjoyed the ending sequence and the creation of the Arrowverse's version of the Justice League.<ref name=\"IGNArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nFor Part 4, Agard felt the Speed Force flashbacks were \"very cheesy and reminiscent of things ''Arrow'' has done in the past. On the other hand, I found it very effective in putting us in the mindset for the final battle and, more importantly, the end of ''Arrow''{{nbsp}}... [T]his episode honors his connection to the other shows and how this one show\u2019s existence has created so much.\" He added Oliver's death in this episode \"packed way more of an emotional punch [over the one in Part 1] because of the three actors\u2019 performances.\" With the ''Legends'' episode, Agard was \"surprised by how strong\" it was, noting, \"[t]he last episode of a crossover is usually the weakest because the big battle ends up taking precedence over character moments, but that\u2019s not the case here at all.\" The episodes were given an \"A\u2013\" by Agard.<ref name=\"EWArrowLegendsReview\" /> Delia Harrington at ''Den of Geek'' felt the final two episodes were \"very different, but equally compelling\". She praised the performances by Amell and Benoist and enjoyed all of the cameos and Easter eggs in the final episodes. She, like Agard, was more approving of Oliver's death in these episodes saying it \"was much more in line with what his character deserved\". For Part 5, Harrington said \"The governing principle of this episode was the banana pants aesthetic of ''Legends'', and that\u2019s exactly what it needed,\" pointing out the appearance of the giant Beebo. Giving the episodes 4 out of 5 stars, she concluded, \"for those of us who were touting ''Arrow'' as the best superhero property on any screen, big or small, back in Season 1, this is truly the television equivalent to ''Endgame''-level storytelling. Some of the old heroes are gone. New heroes rise in their place. The fandom mourns, but we also get to celebrate all the new stories there are to tell.\"<ref name=\"DenOfGeekArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nKate Kulzick of ''The A.V. Club'' was more negative on the ''Arrow'' episode, giving it a \"C\u2013\". She said, \"''Arrow''{{'}}s contribution to the crossover not only fails to live up to the dramatic stakes of that cliffhanger, it sours the goodwill generated by the first three episodes, retreading old ground and sending the crossover limping into its finale.\" Kulzick was disappointed more explanation was not given to how the Monitor and Ant-Monitor received their god-like powers. She also called the Speed Force moments \"arbitrary\" it what could have been \"a wonderful opportunity to relive and re-imagine high points from each of the Arrowverse shows\u2019 histories.\" Getting to the final battle between the Paragons and Anti-Monitor was where Kulzick felt the episode \"really starts to flounder\". Unlike Agard and Harrington, Kulzick felt Oliver's death was \"a pale shadow of the raw and emotional end of part one\" and \"one hell of a disappointing way to send out Oliver Queen\".<ref name=\"AVClubArrowReview\" /> For the ''Legends'' episode, ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Allison Shoemaker felt some of the concepts in the episode were \"flimsy\" adding, \"The plot is fine. The characters and their reactions to what\u2019s happened, to that loss and the new status quo, is what really hits home.\" The highlight character moment to Shoemaker was Barry and Sara's conversation, followed by Sara and Diggle's. She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubLegendsReview\" />\n\n==''Crisis Aftermath''==\n''Crisis Aftermath'' is an [[aftershow]] that aired after the December 8 ''Supergirl'' episode and the December 10 ''The Flash'' episode. The show went \"in-depth to explore\" the crossover, and was hosted by [[Kevin Smith]].<ref name=\"Aftershow\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' helped develop the special. The show featured discussions with executive producers Guggenheim, Dries, Rovner, Shimizu, and Wallace; stars Cryer, Garrett, McNamara, and Conroy; and panel guest Dani Fernandez, among others.

[[Arrowverse]] [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] event, featuring episodes of the television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' on [[The CW]]. The ''Supergirl'', ''Batwoman'', and ''The Flash'' episodes aired in December 2019, while the ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episodes aired in January 2020. Additionally, events in the ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\", airing between ''Batwoman'' and ''The Flash'', and a two-issue comic featuring characters and concepts unable to appear in the live-action episodes, tie into the event.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", which is inspired by the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]], continues plotlines established in the previous crossover, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\". Moreover, the preceding episodes of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow'' season eight]] and much of [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash'' season six]] served as a prelude to the crossover. In \"Crisis\", the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] gathers [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]], the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]], and several \"Paragons\" from throughout the multiverse to stop the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] from destroying all of reality. The crossover's events resulted in the Arrowverse's continuity being [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]].\n\nInitial references to the crossover began in 2014, with [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''The Flash''. The adaptation began in earnest during the development of \"Elseworlds\", with the crossover title revealed at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in December 2018. In mid-2019, multiple castings were announced, including actors who previously portrayed DC characters in other media, such as [[Burt Ward]] and [[Kevin Conroy]]. \"Crisis\" also sees [[Cress Williams]] from fellow CW series ''Black Lightning'' appear and cross over with the Arrowverse for the first time, along with actors reprising their roles from various DC film and television series. Filming took place from the end of September 2019 until the beginning of November 2019.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Prelude===\nTo prepare for the coming Crisis, the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] recruits [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] and sends him on missions to collect various items.<ref name=\"ArrowFinale\" /> The former also retrieves the cadaver of [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]] and revives him.<ref name=\"SupergirlFinale\" /><ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /> [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] and [[Iris West (Arrowverse)|Iris West-Allen]] learn that the Crisis date has moved up to December 2019 and that to save billions, the Flash must die.<ref name=\"Flash601\" /> To learn more about what happens to him, Barry travels to [[Earth-3 (Arrowverse)|Earth-3]] to see [[Jay Garrick (Arrowverse)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Joan Williams (Arrowverse)|Joan Williams]], who have been tracking antimatter signatures across the multiverse. They send Barry's mind forward in time, causing him to see billions of timelines where the multiverse is destroyed and the one where he dies saving it.<ref name=\"Flash602\" />\n\nMeanwhile, on one of his missions, Oliver witnesses the destruction of [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]] from an antimatter wave.<ref name=\"Earth2Destroyed\" /> Back in [[Star City (Arrowverse)|Star City]], [[William Clayton (Arrowverse)|William Clayton]], [[Connor Hawke (Arrowverse Earth-1)|Connor Hawke]], and [[Mia Smoak]] mysteriously time travel from 2040 to the present,<ref name=\"Arrow803\" /> while Oliver and [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] learn that [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]] has been working with the Monitor.<ref name=\"Arrow805\" /> Minutes before the Crisis begins, [[Nash Wells]] is teleported into a chamber under [[Central City (Arrowverse)|Central City]] after being promised a new life.<ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /> As the Crisis starts, red skies loom over Central City and [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], where Lyla, now a \"Harbinger of things to come\", collects Oliver and Mia.<ref name=\"Flash608\" /><ref name=\"Arrow807\" />\n\nOn an unspecified Earth, the skies turn red over Freeland, causing [[Jennifer Pierce (Arrowverse)|Jennifer Pierce]]'s powers to adversely react and tear her between her Earth and those of two of her alternate counterparts.

Clark and Lois narrowly send their son [[Jonathan Kent (Arrowverse)|Jonathan]] off into an escape pod just as the wave wipes out Argo alongside Alura. Harbinger brings Barry, [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Kate Kane]], [[Sara Lance]] and [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]] to Earth-38, while also rescuing the Kents from Argo. Harbinger briefs the gathered heroes on the threat of the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] as the Monitor raises a quantum tower to impede the antimatter wave while the [[Department of Extranormal Operations (Arrowverse)|DEO]] and [[Lena Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lena Luthor]] work to evacuate Earth-38's inhabitants to [[Earth-1 (Arrowverse)|Earth-1]]. Brainy locates Jonathan's pod on [[Earth-16 (Arrowverse)|Earth-16]], so he, Lois, and Sara leave to retrieve him while the others stay behind to fend off the Anti-Monitor's forces. In preparation for his death, Oliver passes the mantle of Green Arrow to Mia. When he learns Barry is fated to die however, he argues with the Monitor over the deal they made last year.{{efn|As depicted in the 2018 crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\".}} The heroes make their stand at the tower and fend off an army of shadow demons until the Monitor teleports them off-world, deeming the battle to be lost. Refusing to leave, Oliver temporarily nullifies the Monitor and stays behind to ensure the exodus succeeds. Back on Earth-1, Lois' team returns with Jonathan before the Monitor brings a dying Oliver to say good-bye, commenting that this was not how he was supposed to die. Nash, now a \"Pariah\" for releasing the Anti-Monitor, appears and announces that events have changed and everything is doomed.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 1 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part One |series=Supergirl |series-link=Supergirl (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=5 |number=9 |airdate=December 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the Earth-1 [[Legends of Tomorrow (Arrowverse team)|Legends]] unavailable, Harbinger recruits [[Earth-74 (Arrowverse)|Earth-74]]'s [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory]] so the heroes can use his ''Waverider'' as their base of operations. In the wake of Oliver's death, which he cannot undo because of the Anti-Monitor's growing power, the Monitor consults the Book of Destiny and learns of seven Paragons who could turn the tide; the \"Paragon of Hope\", Kara; the \"Paragon of Destiny\", Sara; the \"Paragon of Truth\", a Superman who has suffered \"more than any mortal man\"; and the \"Paragon of Courage\", who is described as the \"Bat of the Future\". Clark, Lois, and Iris locate the second Superman on [[Earth-96 (Arrowverse)|Earth-96]], though Lex uses the Book of Destiny to mind-control that Earth's Clark until Lois knocks Lex out. Kara and Kate travel to [[Earth-99 (Arrowverse)|Earth-99]], where the latter fails to recruit an elderly crippled [[Bruce Wayne (Arrowverse Earth-99)|Bruce Wayne]], who became a killer. Bruce is in turn accidentally electrocuted in a heated confrontation with Kate and Kara. Elsewhere on [[Earth-18 (Arrowverse)|Earth-18]], Sara, Barry, Mia, and [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]] take Oliver's body to a [[Lazarus Pit]] in an attempt to resurrect him, but the accumulating antimatter across the multiverse prevents them from bringing his soul back. Back on the ''Waverider'', the Monitor tasks Ray with building a \"Paragon detector\", which identifies Kate as the true \"Paragon of Courage\". Unbeknownst to everyone, Harbinger is secretly contacted by the Anti-Monitor.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 2 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Two |series=Batwoman |series-link=Batwoman (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=1 |number=9 |airdate=December 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]]'s help, Ray's \"Paragon detector\" identifies Barry as the \"Paragon of Love\", [[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]] as the \"Paragon of Honor\", and [[Ivy Town (Arrowverse)|Ivy Town]] scientist [[Ryan Choi (Arrowverse)|Ryan Choi]] as the \"Paragon of Humanity\". Iris, Ray, and [[Ralph Dibny (Arrowverse)|Ralph Dibny]] attempt to recruit a reluctant Choi, who eventually complies when Iris assures him that ordinary people can be heroes too. After the Monitor restores Cisco's powers, he, Barry, and [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] meet up with Pariah at the Anti-Monitor's chamber beneath Central City, where they find an anti-matter cannon powered by the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Flash]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]]. When Cisco frees Barry-90, the cannon goes critical, so Pariah recruits Jefferson from his recently-destroyed Earth to contain the energy. Barry-1 volunteers to destroy the cannon, which would result in his prophesied death. However, Barry-90 stops him, claiming the Monitor did not specify which Flash would die in the Crisis and takes his place. Meanwhile, Constantine, Mia, and Diggle visit [[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer]] on [[Earth-666 (Arrowverse)|Earth-666]] to get his help in entering [[Purgatory]] and retrieve Oliver's soul. Before they can leave, [[Jim Corrigan]] appears and bestows the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]'s power onto Oliver. He accepts, and Constantine's team is returned to the ''Waverider'' without him. While the heroes regroup, the Anti-Monitor sends a brainwashed Harbinger to kill the Monitor so he can absorb his power and finish destroying the multiverse. Before the remaining heroes and Earth-1 are destroyed, Pariah sends the Paragons to the Vanishing Point to keep them safe, where they witness Lex replace Superman-96 with himself using a page from the Book of Destiny.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 3 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Three |series=The Flash |series-link=The Flash (2014 TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=6 |number=9 |airdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn a flashback to the planet Maltus 10,000 years ago, Mar Novu experiments with time-travel to witness the birth of the universe, only to accidentally end up in the antimatter universe and reveal the multiverse's existence to the Anti-Monitor. In the months since the multiverse was destroyed, the Paragons have struggled to survive at the Vanishing Point. Once Corrigan teaches him how to use the Spectre's power, Oliver heads to the Vanishing Point to rescue the Paragons and strengthen Barry's powers. With his increased speed, Barry drops off Kara, Choi, and Lex on Maltus, but loses everyone else across the Speed Force after being attacked by the Anti-Monitor. Despite an expected double-cross from Lex, Kara and Choi convince Novu not to go through with his plans. Once Barry retrieves everyone, they arrive at the dawn of time, only to learn the Anti-Monitor will always learn of the multiverse's existence as there will always be a version of Novu who cannot give up his ambitions. The Paragons battle the Anti-Monitor and his shadow demons until Oliver uses the Spectre's power to restore the multiverse, with the Paragons providing additional assistance via Lex's Book of Destiny page. As a result however, Oliver dies a second and final time in Barry and Sara's arms.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 4 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Four |series=Arrow |series-link=Arrow (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |season=8 |number=8 |airdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWaking up in the newly-recreated universe, the Paragons discover they are the only ones who remember the Crisis and that both Earth-38 and Jefferson's Earth were merged with Earth-1 into a composite universe later designated as [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]], among other changes throughout the multiverse. While J'onn uses his psionic powers to bring their allies up to speed, Sara attempts to find Oliver, though without success. Later that night, the Paragons are attacked by shadow demons. A restored and remorseful Nash discovers that the Anti-Monitor is still alive and plotting to renew his destruction of the multiverse. To stop him once and for all, Nash, Ray, Barry, and Choi work to develop a bomb capable of shrinking the Anti-Monitor for eternity while the other heroes distract him. Once it is finished, Kara uses it on the Anti-Monitor, sending him to the microverse. Sometime later, Barry, Kara, Sara, Kate, Clark, J'onn, and Jefferson hold a memorial service for Oliver before agreeing to come together to protect their new world in his memory.<ref name=\"Crisis Part 5 ep\">{{Cite episode |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Five |series=Legends of Tomorrow |series-link=Legends of Tomorrow |network=[[The CW]] |season=5 |number=1 |airdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{further2|[[List of Supergirl characters|Supergirl]], [[List of Batwoman characters|Batwoman]], [[List of The Flash characters|The Flash]], [[List of Arrow characters|Arrow]], and [[List of Legends of Tomorrow characters|Legends of Tomorrow]] cast and characters}}\n\n===Main and recurring===\n<!--Ordered per WP:TVCAST.

Arrowverse in [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /> In September 2018, three months before the release of \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319]] [[Arrowverse]] crossover,<ref name=\"ElseworldsTitle\" /> ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' executive producer Phil Klemmer said \"people [were] already talking about\" the 2019 crossover, with it already having \"a loose shape\".<ref name=\"KlemmerSep2018\" /> In early December 2018, a week before the airing of \"Elseworlds\", ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' showrunner Beth Schwartz said the producers for all the series \"already know a lot about what's going on in next year's crossover,\"<ref name=\"SchwartzDec2018\" /> while [[Marc Guggenheim]] stated \"Elseworlds\" would \"lay the groundwork\" for the [[2019\u201320 United States network television schedule|2019\u201320 crossover]].<ref name=\"TVInsiderNov2018\" /> The end of \"Elseworlds\" revealed the crossover title and premise as \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", adapting the story from the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]].<ref name=\"CrisisOnInfiniteEarthsCrossover\" /> \"Elseworlds\" introduced the characters [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Mar Novu / Monitor]] and [[Psycho-Pirate (Arrowverse)|Psycho-Pirate]], and alluded to an impending \"crisis\".<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsSetUp\" />\n\nIn January 2019, ''The Flash'' showrunner [[Todd Helbing]] said the remainder of the [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]] would contain things in service of the forthcoming crossover.<ref name=\"HelbingJan2019\" /> At that time, [[The CW]] President [[Mark Pedowitz]] called the crossover \"the biggest, the most complicated one\" to date, and was hopeful ''Legends of Tomorrow'', which did not participate in \"Elseworlds\" because of production complications, would be part of \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"PedowitzJan2019\" /> When pitching the crossover to the studio and network early on, Guggenheim noted the creators stressed they did not want the event to be \"Crisis on CW Earths\", but to have the ability \"to touch as many strands of the DC tapestry as possible.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" />\n\nIn May 2019, Pedowitz announced at The CW's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation that the crossover would include ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', and ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'' in a five-episode event, spanning dates in both late 2019 and early 2020.<ref name=\"CrisisTwoQuarters\" /> The crossover occurred in the ninth episodes of [[Supergirl (season 5)|''Supergirl''{{'}}s fifth season]],<ref name=\"SupergirlEpisodeNumber\" /> [[Batwoman (TV series)|''Batwoman''{{'}}s first season]],<ref name=\"BatwomanPreCrisis\" /> and [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash''{{'}}s sixth season]],<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> in the eighth episode of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season]],<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" /> and as a special episode of the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|''Legends of Tomorrow''{{'}}s fifth season]]; this episode is not considered the series' season premiere.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Speaking to the comparison of the crossover to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), Guggenheim felt \"for [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry]] and [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]], there is an emotional denouement that is reminiscent of ''Endgame''\" adding, \"''Endgame'' is an exclamation point. \"Crisis\" is a semi-colon.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\n===Lead-up===\nIn May 2019, the season finales of ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''Supergirl'', and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' all featured teases for the upcoming crossover, with the Monitor making an appearance in all series except ''The Flash''.<ref name=\"SeasonFinaleTeases\" /> Eric Wallace, showrunner of the sixth season of ''The Flash'', stated that when all the series' showrunners discussed plans for their series before the crossover, \"all of this synergy started to happen\" with \"a lot of cross collaboration\" in service to the crossover events. Wallace felt the themes of grief, death, and the end of all worlds in \"Crisis\" worked with the story they were trying to tell with the villain [[Ramsey Rosso (Arrowverse)|Ramsey Rosso / Bloodwork]], \"who is facing the end of his own world\". This allowed the start of season six of ''The Flash'' to help set up the crossover.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> The majority of ''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season serves as a prelude to the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettArrowS8Prelude\" /> The ''Arrow'' writers consulted with ''The Flash'' writers regarding the destruction of [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]] in \"[[Starling City (Arrow episode)|Starling City]]\" to ensure they could destroy this Earth.<ref name=\"Earth2Destroyed\" /> On ''Supergirl'', co-showrunner [[Robert Rovner]] said the season would tease the crossover \"in our way, which is a little bit different from the way ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' are doing it.\" He also highlighted the return of [[Malefic J'onzz (Arrowverse)|Malefic]], [[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]]'s brother, as a major plot thread leading to the crossover, describing it as \"a gauntlet for J'onn\".<ref name=\"SupergirlEPsSep2019\" /> [[LaMonica Garrett]], who portrays both the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor, said before the crossover, the Anti-Monitor's \"presence [would] be felt before you physically see him,\" adding, \"You see just enough of him to know this guy means business, but it's not in your face in every scene leading up to\" the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> The preceding episodes of ''Batwoman'', ''Supergirl'', ''The Flash'', and ''Arrow'' featured an end tag scene with [[Nash Wells]] gaining access to the chamber under Central City.<ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /><ref name=\"Flash608\" /><ref name=\"Arrow807Tag\" /><!--<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> can source all episodes having the tag, if needed. -->\n\n===Tie-ins===\nThe ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" tied in to \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", ahead of [[Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jefferson Pierce]] first appearing in ''The Flash'' episode of the crossover. The episode saw red skies cover Freeland before anti-matter strikes [[Jennifer Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jennifer Pierce]], sending her to a void where she finds her Earth-1 and 2 counterparts. An anti-matter wave eventually wipes them out, along with her Earth, except for Jefferson, who is teleported to an unknown location.<ref name=\"BlackLightning309\" />\n\nThe crossover story was expanded in a two-issue comics series, ''Crisis on Infinite Earths Giant'', written by [[Marv Wolfman]], the writer of the 1985 original series, and Guggenheim and illustrated by Tom Derenick, Trevor Scott, [[John Kalisz]], Andy Owens, Hi-Fi, [[Tom Grummett]], Danny Miki, and [[Chris Sotomayor]].<ref name=\"ComicsGiantDC\" /> The issues also reprinted material from the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' comic, with the second issue including material from ''DC Universe: Legacies'' #6 (2010). Speaking to the issues, Guggenheim said their conception \"came pretty early on in the process\" once it was realized the scope of the story would be more than the five episodes. By creating the comics, it allowed the producers to utilize \"all of the characters that we don't have in the crossover proper for logistical reasons, or financial reasons, or creative reasons{{nbsp}}... [The comics] allows us to tell a major piece of the story that we're designing, with characters and concepts that we couldn't achieve in live action.\" The four main characters of the comic are [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]], the [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray]], [[Nyssa al Ghul (Arrowverse)|Nyssa al Ghul]], and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West]], in addition to appearances by [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Atom]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], the Flash,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> the Monitor, [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]], and others.<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Serious consideration was given to include the [[Huntress (Arrowverse)|Huntress]], but Guggenheim opted for Nyssa al Ghul instead because \"we had done [[Arrow: Season 2.5|a comic book tie-in]] that bridged [[Arrow (season 2)|seasons two]] and [[Arrow (season 3)|three]] of ''Arrow'' and [Huntress] had featured prominently in that, so Nyssa had not yet had her chance to be immortalized that way.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Wolfman added that the comics were \"created to tie in perfectly with the CW shows\" so it felt like a main part of the story and not ancillary,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> adding, \"This is integral to the entire storyline.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> The first comic debuted exclusively in [[Walmart]] stores on December 15, 2019, with the second releasing on January 19, 2020, and releases in comic stores the month after.<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> The events of the comics occur during the first part of the ''Batwoman'' episode of the crossover.<ref name=\"ComicsGiantTwitter\" /> The stories from both issues, plus behind-the-scenes extra, will be collected in a deluxe edition hardcover, set for release on May 6, 2020.<ref name=\"ComicsHardCover\" />\n\n===Writing===\nEach part of the crossover was written by the following creative teams. The ''Supergirl'' episode was written by Derek Simon and [[Jay Faerber]] with [[Robert Rovner]] and Guggenheim contributing the story,<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson wrote the ''Batwoman'' episode,<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> and Lauren Certo and Sterling Gates wrote ''The Flash'' episode, with Eric Wallace conceiving the story.<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> The ''Arrow'' episode was co-written by Wolfman and Guggenheim,<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode was written by [[Keto Shimizu]] and Ubah Mohamed.<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" />\n\nThe writers gathered for a two-week session to write the crossover. Guggenheim, who was the overall creative for \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", began by creating \"a series of big tentpole beats that could happen in each of the five hours\". These moments were designed to be modular, meaning they could be moved between the episodes depending on each series' creative needs, the scheduling of actors, and other factors. This also helped determine the order each episode aired. Guggenheim's initial template was catered to ''Arrow'' being the fourth hour and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' being the fifth \"because in crossovers past, ''Legends'' has always been the finale of the crossover.\" The CW then requested for ''The Flash'' to be the third hour, and after working \"out those tentpoles, for a variety of different plot reasons, it made a lot of sense for the first hour to be ''Supergirl''\", leaving ''Batwoman'' as the second hour.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Within this, certain characters were considered \"integral\", while others would just make cameo appearances, should that actor be available to appear.<ref name=\"GuggenheimRollingStoneDec2019\" /> With the large moments determined, the individual writers then broke off to write each episode, before the group reconvened to review the whole, making adjustments and moving moments as necessary. Each series' writers would work on their title character's scenes (for example, Supergirl's scenes on ''Batwoman'' were written by the ''Supergirl'' writers) to ensure consistency. The story is considered \"a five-hour epic\" as opposed to individual episodes, but the title character of each series and characters appropriate for those worlds (such as [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Barry Allen]] of Earth-90 appearing on ''The Flash''), were given highlights.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> The episodes' scripts were completed by early September 2019.<ref name=\"Scripts\" />\n\nGuggenheim stated the crossover would try to incorporate \"seminal moments\" from the comic book, with the opening of the Arrowverse crossover showing the destruction of various parallel universes similarly to the comic's beginning.<ref name=\"GuggenheimSeminalMoments\" /> Speaking to the deaths of Supergirl and the Flash from the comic storyline, Wallace conceded that the writers \"can't just kill all of our number ones on our shows\" but a proper balance was found in killing some.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> Though it was revealed in \"Elseworlds\" that Oliver would die in the crossover, which Guggenheim felt \"spoiled our own story\", his death in the first hour was done in an attempt to \"surprise the audience\" who may have expected him to die in the fifth. It was also done to \"establish the stakes going into the next four hours\".<ref name=\"OliverDeathEW\" /> In the third hour, the death of Barry Allen from Earth-90 was \"a way to honor what was said [by] the Monitor {{nbsp}}... saying the Flash must die\" without killing Gustin's character. Wallace thought this gave \"it a nice story twist, [to] get in some emotion\" while also \"complet[ing] a 30-year arc\" for [[John Wesley Shipp]]'s character. The flashback scene from the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990 ''Flash'' television series]] was not originally scripted for inclusion, but was added while editing the episode \"to give a little bit of his life flashing before his eyes\".<ref name=\"Flash90Death\" /> Oliver dies for a second time at the end of the ''Arrow'' episode. Once again, this was done to \"[surprise] the audience with the unexpected\" according to Guggenheim, adding, \"I think <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Stephen Amell]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> enjoyed A) the opportunity to play two death scenes and B) the creative sleight of hand in terms of surprising the audience.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nThe original comic was created to help with [[DC Comics]]' continuity problems, but since the Arrowverse does not have those, the crossover allowed the creators to focus on the characters and their interactions. Supergirl and Batwoman's relationship was further developed, after being teased at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in a way that \"those two characters [are] supporting each other much in the same way that Barry and Oliver have been supporting each other in previous crossovers.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" /> For scenes set in [[Gotham City]], ''Batwoman'' showrunner Caroline Dries ensured the grounded tone of the series was kept to since it is \"not normal for [the characters of ''Batwoman''] to interact with aliens and travel to different universes\".<ref name=\"DriesTCA\" /> The version of the Anti-Monitor that appears was also inspired by the character's appearance in the [[New 52]] \"Darkseid Wars\" storyline.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> [[Sara Lance]] is the focus of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' characters, with the crossover \"kick[ing] off Sara's emotional journey for season 5 of ''Legends''\" and giving Sara \"a different perspective on things.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" /> Though the early allusions to \"Crisis\" on ''The Flash'' mentioned the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and [[Tom Cavanagh]] was said to be reprising the role in the crossover,<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /><ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /> the character did not make an appearance. Guggenheim did not want to be beholden to this, pointing out that the newspaper headline mentioning him had been created by executives no longer involved with the series or this crossover. The character had also already featured prominently in previous crossovers.<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Psycho-Pirate, included in \"Elseworlds\", was another character that appeared in early versions of the crossover. Ultimately, per Guggenheim, he was not included since \"given the story we were telling, the only reason we were having him in there was because he was in the original comic\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" />\n\nWith the inclusion of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] from ''[[Smallville]]'' in the crossover, it explored what happened to the characters after ''Smallville'' ended.<ref name=\"Durance\" /> [[Erica Durance]], who portrays that series' Lois Lane, said, \"It's a little bit of a look into their future and the different choices they've made to be together. It's a full-circle moment that's really nice.\" Guggenheim pointed out that the ''Batwoman'' episode where the characters appear was written by former writers on ''Smallville''. This allowed Guggenheim to \"[step] aside and let them speak to where things were headed. As a fan of the show, it answered a lot of questions that I had. It provided a lot of closure, I think, in a really nice way.\" The ''Smallville'' material in the crossover was shared with ''Smallville'' co-creator [[Alfred Gough]] before filming began.<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Despite having three actors who portray Clark Kent / Superman in the crossover, there was never a scene written featuring all three. The writers wanted a clear distinction of Welling's character appearing at the Kent Farm, with Routh's character appearing at the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. Guggenheim added, \"The desire to have multiple Supermen [together] is what inspired the backup story\" in the comic tie-in.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> Appearing as [[Bruce Wayne]] in live-action for the first time allowed [[Kevin Conroy]] to \"explore a lot of [the] dark corners\" of the character in a different way than when he voiced an older version of the character in the animated series ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" />\n\n[[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer Morningstar]]'s appearance was considered to be five years before the events of ''[[Lucifer (TV series)|Lucifer]]'', according to actor [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]], who added, \"This is him in his proper playboy, don't-give-a-damn-about-anything stage in his life. He is very irreverent with our characters when they turn up in the scene and obviously, with [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|Constantine]], there is some history there.\"<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> His scene was written by Certo, a fan of ''Lucifer'', and was sent to the creative team on ''Lucifer'' for their feedback. ''Lucifer'' co-showrunner Joe Henderson suggested Lucifer's flirting joke, while Ellis contributed the bit of him saying \"Constantyne\" instead of \"Constantine\". Henderson called Lucifer's appearance \"the coolest thing\" since he wanted to participate once he knew the Arrowverse series were adapting ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.<ref name=\"EWLuciferShowrunners\" /> The inclusion of Black Lightning in the crossover was decided \"very late in the game\" according to Guggenheim. He worked closely with ''Black Lightning'' showrunner [[Salim Akil]] to figure out a way to incorporate the character in a way that would not be a simple cameo but \"in a way that feels significant\". Once the logistics and creative elements were solved, having the character \"elevated the crossover to another level\". On the character's appearance, actor [[Cress Williams]] stated the character's entrance comes \"in a very surprising way. He's not prepared for it. So, he doesn't know these people.\" Williams added that because of this, there is \"some conflict early on when he's trying to figure out, who are you people and why am I here?\".<ref name=\"BlackLightningEWNov2019\" />\n\nBarry's journey through the Speed Force in the ''Arrow'' hour was an opportunity for the writers to \"revisit a series 'greatest hits' for Oliver, key moments in terms of his relationships{{nbsp}}... it\u2019s a little bit of a 'Before you die, your life flashes before your eyes' kind of feel\"; it was important to the writers that they could \"look backwards before Oliver's death.\" Oliver and Diggle's fight in the [[Arrow (season 6)|season six]] episode \"[[Brothers in Arms (Arrow)|Brothers in Arms]]\" was originally planned for Kate's scene in the Speed Force, with Kate helping to break up the fight. The writers felt season six was \"relatively recent\", so they chose \"[[Suicidal Tendencies (Arrow)|Suicidal Tendencies]]\" from [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]]. This episode, one of Guggenheim's favorites, and the argument between Oliver and Ray helped show \"how much all of the shows have evolved and relationships between the characters have evolved.\" The other moments in the Speed Force were also chosen based on \"showing how far the characters have come\". While in the Speed Force, Barry encountered [[Ezra Miller]]'s [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen]] from the [[DC Extended Universe]]. Guggenheim worked with DC Comics' Chief Creative Officer [[Jim Lee]] and DC Entertainment's film vice president Adam Schlagman on the scene to ensure it would not conflict with the planned [[The Flash (film)|''Flash'' film]].<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" />\n\nThe end of the crossover sees Barry converting the old [[S.T.A.R. Labs (Arrowverse)|S.T.A.R. Labs]] hangar seen in the \"[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion!]]\" crossover to a spot where the heroes could gather for future team-ups,<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> along with a hint at a possible introduction of [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] and the [[Wonder Twins]]. These hints were a \"fun bit\" the writers knew they wanted to end the crossover on, with an early version of the scripts having the Wonder Twins make an appearance.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> Guggenheim had tried to have [[Swamp Thing]] appear to interact with Constantine, given their history and relationship in the comics. This was \"a really important inclusion\" for Guggenheim, but \"for a variety of different reasons,\" it could not happen.<ref name=\"SwampThing\" />\n\n===Casting===\nLaMonica Garrett was upgraded to series regular status on all of the series, receiving the credit in the episodes he appears in before the crossover, to ensure he would have been available for \"Crisis\" and his appearances leading up to it.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> In July 2019 at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], multiple castings for the crossover were announced. They included: [[Tyler Hoechlin]] reprising his role as [[Superman (Arrowverse)|Superman]],<ref name=\"HoechlinRouthSuperman\" /> while [[Brandon Routh]], who portrays Ray Palmer / Atom in the Arrowverse, would reprise his role as Superman from the film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006), portraying \"an older, more world-weary\" version, inspired by the [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|''Kingdom Come'' Superman]];<ref name=\"RouthKingdomCome\" /><ref name=\"RouthSupermanClarify\" /><ref name=\"/FilmTCAAug2019\" /> Tom Cavanagh would portray [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]] in addition to Nash Wells;<ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /><ref name=\"NashWells\" /> [[Burt Ward]], who portrayed [[Dick Grayson|<!-- don't delink -->Dick Grayson / Robin]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s Batman television series]], would appear in an undisclosed role;<ref name=\"Ward\" /> Amell portraying multiple versions of Oliver Queen;<ref name=\"MultipleOliverQueens\" /> [[Jon Cryer]] reprising his role as Lex Luthor;<ref name=\"LexLuthor\" /> and Garrett also portraying the Anti-Monitor in addition to the Monitor.<ref name=\"AntiMonitor\" /> Shortly after, [[Elizabeth Tulloch]] was also confirmed to be reprising her role as [[Lois Lane (Arrowverse)|Lois Lane]].<ref name=\"Tulloch\" />\n\nThe following month, at the [[Television Critics Association]], Pedowitz announced that cast members from the series ''Black Lightning'' would appear,<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> something star Cress Williams previously hinted at,<ref name=\"CressWilliamsTease\" /> and that Kevin Conroy would appear as an elderly Bruce Wayne, having previously voiced the character in multiple animated media.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Conroy \"jumped at\" the opportunity to portray the character in live action, having not done it previously. He also felt it would be an opportunity to satisfy the \"loyal\" fanbase of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', who also expressed interest in seeing Conroy portray the character on camera.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" /> Guggenheim also revealed the producers discussed with DC and Warner Bros. about the possibility of having [[Lynda Carter]] reprise her role as [[Wonder Woman]] from the [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|television series]], but felt it was unlikely to happen.<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" />\n\nIn September, [[Johnathon Schaech]] was confirmed to be reprising his role as [[Jonah Hex (Arrowverse)|Jonah Hex]],<ref name=\"JonahHex\" /> and shortly after [[John Wesley Shipp]] was cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Shipp\" /> Around this time, Tom Ellis was approached to appear as Lucifer Morningstar from the series ''Lucifer''. Working on his series, Ellis \"talked over the years about Lucifer being a DC character and, 'Is there any chance of this happening?'\", feeling \"Crisis\" was a good chance to explore that connection for the character.<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> In the middle of the month, it was announced that [[Tom Welling]] and Erica Durance would reprise their roles as Clark Kent and Lois Lane, respectively, from ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"Welling\" /><ref name=\"Durance\" /> Durance also returns to reprise her Arrowverse role as [[Alura Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Alura Zor-El]].<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]], who portrayed [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] on ''Smallville'', revealed Warner Bros. and the producers approached him to reprise the role in \"Crisis\", but he ultimately declined.<ref name=\"RosenbaumApproached\" /> [[Alan Ritchson]], who played [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry/Aquaman]] on ''Smallville'', was also approached to reprise his role in the crossover but he turned it down due to his scheduling conflicts with the series ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]''.<ref name=\"Ritchson\" /> Later in the month, [[Osric Chau]] was cast as [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]] and [[Ashley Scott]] was confirmed to be reprising her role as [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Kyle / Huntress]] from the series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.<ref name=\"Chau\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" /> At the start of October, [[Audrey Marie Anderson]] was announced to be reprising her role as [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]], while also taking on the [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]] persona from the comics; Lyla previously used \"Harbinger\" as her [[A.R.G.U.S.]] codename.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> The same month, [[Stephen Lobo]] was cast as [[Jim Corrigan]].<ref name=\"Lobo\" /> By that time, the producers had reached out to [[Nicolas Cage]], who at one point was attached to portray Superman in the planned ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]'' film, about appearing.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\"/>\n\nAt the end of November, it was reported that [[Brec Bassinger]] would appear in the crossover as [[Courtney Whitmore|<!--don't delink-->Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]], ahead of the release of [[Stargirl (TV series)|her series]] on the streaming service [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] later in 2020.<ref name=\"Stargirl\" /> [[Ezra Miller]] appeared in the ''Arrow'' episode reprising his [[DC Extended Universe]] role of Barry Allen, after [[Warner Bros. Television]] president [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] spoke to Guggenheim about including him. Despite production on the crossover being completed, Guggenheim approached Gustin to see if he would be \"on-board\" with Miller appearing, not wanting to do it if Gustin was not, and Gustin \"was incredibly enthusiastic\" with the idea.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> Guggenheim also called Jim Lee \"instrumental in making [the cameo] happen\".<ref name=\"EzraMiller\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction for \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began on September 24, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> Filming at the farmhouse for the Kent family farm took place at the end of the month.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /> The farmhouse had previously been featured in the \"Elseworlds\" crossover and on ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsKentFarm\" /> Production for the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode began on October 4.<ref name=\"LegendsProduction\" /> Williams took a break from filming ''Black Lightning'' in [[Atlanta]] to spend a week filming his parts of the crossover in [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"WilliamsFilming\" /> His scenes were reviewed by the crew of ''Black Lightning'' to ensure his characterization was consistent with his series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Filming had completed by November 8, with some reshoots and minor filming having finished by December 19.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnd2\" /> Once Miller's cameo was finalized, a small crew from ''The Flash'' was used to film it since the ''Arrow'' crew had already wrapped on the series and was no longer around.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nDirectors on the crossover included [[Jesse Warn]] (''Supergirl''),<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Laura Belsey (''Batwoman''),<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> David McWhirter (''The Flash''),<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> [[Glen Winter]] (''Arrow''),<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] (''Legends of Tomorrow'').<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" /> These directors were hired specifically for the crossover, because of their previous experience working in the Arrowverse, allowing them to create a unified look, with help from their directors of photography. ''Batwoman'', which normally is filmed in a different [[aspect ratio]] than the other series, used the same ratio as the other series for a consistent look. Many of the stunt sequences, particularly in the ''Supergirl'' and ''Arrow'' episodes, were filmed with drones.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Blake Neely]], along with his collaborators Nathaniel Blume, Sherri Chung, and Daniel Chan, began work on the crossover on November 20, 2019,<ref name=\"ScoreStart\" /> with the score recorded by a live orchestra on December 2.<ref name=\"ScoreRecording\" /><ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> [[Tony Kanal]] and [[Stephen Perkins]] were featured performers on the score.<ref name=\"ScorePerformers\" /> Neely incorporated many musical [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] into his score, some of which were \"cues the production has attempted to obtain the rights to for years\";<ref name=\"ScoreEasterEggs\" /> some cues included the 1960s Batman television series theme,<ref name=\"60sBatmanTheme\" /> the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] theme,<ref name=\"89BatmanTheme\" /> \"hints\" of the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' theme, the march theme and \"Can You Read My Mind?\" from the [[Superman (1978 film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]],<ref name=\"Part2EasterEggs\" /> the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990s ''Flash'' television series]] theme,<ref name=\"Part3EasterEggs\" /> and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' theme.<ref name=\"TVLineFinaleRecap\" />\n\n===Effect on the Arrowverse===\nAhead of the crossover, Guggenheim told each of the series' showrunners \"there's an opportunity here to introduce some major status quo shift[s]\" if they desired, and it was something each series \"have embraced\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Guggenheim described it as \"it wasn't so much a burden of fixing something, it was the freedom of being able to change whatever we wanted to change.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> He added that each series would be affected, outside of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', since \"the crossover launches much of that season\" though there would be \"one rather big ramification\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Coming out of the crossover, Dries was looking to \"make Kate's life a little bit more integrated with all of this madness of sci-fi and aliens, and the dense mythology between\" the other series, but still keep the grounded nature established earlier in ''Batwoman''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> However, this was \"a little tricky because our characters aren\u2019t yet exposed to this notion of multiple universes, superheroes, powers, and stuff.\"<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> An action by Barry would have ramifications for the remainder of ''The Flash''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> The goal of the crossover for Wallace was to \"tap into that feeling that the readers in 1985 would have had, when reading that story, with the tectonic shifts in the comic world, underneath\" and felt the Arrowverse ending was a \"game-changer\" that \"opens up to a whole new world\".<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nBy the end of the crossover, the universe had been rebooted, with all of the CW series airing at the time{{Snd}}''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', ''Supergirl'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ''Batwoman'', and ''Black Lightning''{{Snd}}now existing on the newly established Earth-Prime; this was decided going into the crossover. A new multiverse was also created, with six of its Earths revealed.<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> Guggenheim said \"there is an opportunity going forward after \"Crisis\" to slowly reveal all of the weird changes,\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> with each series \"get[ing] the chance to tell a piece of that story.\"<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Some of the changes include John Diggle and Lyla Michaels' daughter Sara returning to the timeline after being changed in [[Flashpoint (Arrowverse)|Flashpoint]], and Lex Luthor having more heroic qualities. Returning baby Sara was \"very important\" to Guggenheim and Schwartz to accomplish in \"Crisis\" after almost doing so in \"Elseworlds\"; it was held off until this crossover because they \"thought it had more punch if it was a part of the universal reboot\". ''Supergirl'' showrunners Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller came to Guggenheim with the idea to alter Lex Luthor, something they \"were all really excited about\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> For ''Batwoman'', the series sees Kate's sister [[Beth Kane|Beth]] return as a separate person from the season's antagonist Alice,<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> with Dries calling this a \"shocking resonance\" for the series.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crisis-on-Infinite-Earths-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo without Oliver Queen]\n| image2 = [https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/crisis-final-logo-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo with Oliver Queen]\n}}\nThe first teaser for the crossover was released on November 10, 2019.<ref name=\"FirstTeaserCast\" /> [[Boost Mobile]] served as a promotional partner for the event.<ref name=\"FirstTeaser\" /> On November 15, The CW released a series of show-specific teaser shorts.<ref name=\"SupergirlShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"BatwomanShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"FlashShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"ArrowShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"LegendsShortTeaser\" /> A week later, the poster for the event was released.<ref name=\"PosterReleased\" /> On November 24, 2019, a full trailer was released.<ref name=\"FullTrailer\" /> A first long trailer for the event was released on December 3, 2019,<ref name=\"FirstLongTrailer\" /> and a second on December 6, 2019.<ref name=\"SecondLongTrailer\" />\n\nWith the release of the initial trailers in November, a logo for the event featuring the leading character from each of the series except Oliver Queen was revealed. Guggenheim claimed that, at that time, legal and financial reasons prevented them from including Amell's character in the logo.<ref name=\"LogoNoOliver\" /> However, with the release of the full trailer in December, Oliver was now included in the logo, which Guggenheim explained was due to \"the creativity of a lot of very smart people\" and \"a loophole\" to allow the change to happen.<ref name=\"LogoWithOliver\" /><ref name=\"LogoWithOliverLoophole\" /> After the crossover concluded, Guggenheim said he had been told \"only actors appearing in all five hours could be in the main title card\", hence the initial exclusion of Amell because he does not appear in Part 5.<ref name=\"LogoOliverExplaination\" />\n\nA week before the final two episodes aired, a second poster for the crossover was released. Russ Burlingame of Comicbook.com said the poster was \"a mirror to the first \"Crisis\" poster, but centering on darkness rather than light\", with different taglines used, and \"the Anti-Monitor standing with his hands raised up and pointed down, whereas The Monitor had stood with his palms up and arms at his sides.\"<ref name=\"ComicbookNewPoster\" /> On January 10, 2020, Amell released a final trailer for the last two parts.<ref name=\"FinalTrailer\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\nThe crossover began with ''Supergirl'' on December 8, 2019, continuing with ''Batwoman'' on December 9 and ''The Flash'' on December 10. \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" concluded with ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' on January 14, 2020.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> The December 9, 2019 episode of ''Black Lightning'' ties into the event.<ref name=\"BlackLightning309\" /> As of late March 2020, the ''Batwoman'' episode of the crossover is expected to air in the United Kingdom in late spring

response===\n====''Supergirl''====\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 100% approval rating, based on 13 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"TV's biggest crossover manages to tie these different universes together, offering plenty of cameos, dramatic moments, and surprising twists that will shake the Arrowverse forever.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supergirl/s05/e09|title=Supergirl \u2013 Season 5 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] gave the first hour a 9 out of 10. He called the episode \"accessible\" for any viewer and felt it did not \"lose sight of the personal and emotional stakes of this conflict\". Schedeen also felt the ''Supergirl'' supporting cast was \"utilized well\". The episode was also deemed \"a very critical episode for ''Arrow'' fans\" given Oliver's death by Schedeen, though he was upset that Barry did not have a large role to play in the episode.<ref name=\"IGNSupergirlReview\" /> Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sara Netzley said \"no amount of watching, reading, and speculating [could] truly [prepare]us for the heroism, the tears, the sacrifice, and the cameos\" of the episode.<ref name=\"EWSupergirlReview\" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Caroline Siede called the opening of the episode \"some of the most exhilarating superhero TV I've ever seen\". Siede was happy \"Crisis\" was the first crossover \"to deliver an episode that feels like a meaningful part of the crossover {{em|and}} a meaningful part of ''Supergirl'' as well.\" She also pointed out the scene between Kara and Clark discussing Argo City's destruction felt \"like ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' and its 'Asgard is not a place, it's a people' ethos\". She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubSupergirlReview\" /> Awarding the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars, Kayti Burt from ''[[Den of Geek]]'' called Oliver's death \"a massively gutsy storytelling move\" and overall, felt the episode \"set the stakes for the crossover journey to come.\" Speaking to the cast in the episode, Burt said, \"By keeping the ensemble in this part of the story relatively small, we were able to spend more time with all of them, not to mention check in with the characters who are ''Supergirl''-specific,\" which led to \"one of the best scenes\" between Alex and Lena.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekSupergirlReview\" />\n\n====''Batwoman''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 92% approval rating, based on 12 reviews for the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/batwoman/s01/e09|title=Batwoman \u2013 Season 1 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen called the episode \"a superhero nerd's dream come true\" since it \"doubles down on the emotional character drama and manages to deliver some of the best live-action Superman moments in a very long time.\" Schedeen noted the ''Smallville'' moments were the \"epilogue fans deserve\", but conceded some fans would not have enjoyed them and praised Routh as \"a solid Superman and a downright terrific Clark Kent\". He added the second hour was less plot-driven and the crossover could be \"moving too slowly for its own good\", but preferred it \"prioritizing the character moments over the plot and spectacle\". Speaking to the Lazarus Pit subplot in the episode, Schedeen deemed it \"an unnecessary addition to an already crowded crossover\". He gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNBatwomanReview\" /> Chancellor Agard at ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the episode a \"B+\" saying \"''Batwoman''{{'}}s Part 2 of the crossover succeeds where Part 1 stumbled a bit. Yes, tonight's episode was just as busy (and cameo-filled), but it flowed smoothly and all of the important beats landed.\" Agard credited the simple task of the heroes searching for the Paragons as to why the episode worked so well. Conroy's appearance was \"truly something,\" according to Agard. He also was one of the fans \"letdown\" by the ''Smallville'' moments, but it eventually made sense to him because \"''Smallville'' was always about Clark Kent [and] his desire to live a normal life despite his powers\".<ref name=\"EWBatwomanReview\" /> Alani Vargas of ''The A.V. Club'' felt \"the writers did a great job of weaving in some of the most famous versions of Superman\" into the episode, though she did note that other characters and elements from ''Batwoman'' got \"the short end of the stick\" in the crossover; she gave the episode a \"B\".<ref name=\"AVClubBatwomanReview\" /> ''Den of Geek''{{'}}s Delia Harrington gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekBatwomanReview\" />\n\n====''The Flash''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 11 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An emotional episode that packs a surprising punch, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" sets the stage for a heartbreaking winter premiere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash/s06/e09|title=The Flash \u2013 Season 6 Episode 9|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen felt \"the cracks are definitely starting to show\" with ''The Flash'' episode, highlighting the number of new characters introduced to the story along with all the plot needed to be covered in this hour. Specifically, he felt Ryan Choi's introduction could have happened before the crossover to \"get some of the backstory out of the way\", and the purgatory storyline \"deserved far more attention\" than the episode was able to give, despite Schedeen being \"very much behind\" Oliver becoming the Spectre. Schedeen was able to see some of the production limitations, commenting on how it was obvious to him some scenes did not have all actors filming together. Despite all this, \"this episode never loses sight of the core appeal of Crisis\" giving characters \"their big moments and celebrating the connections these characters have forged.\" Schedeen praised Earth-90 Flash's sacrifice, the way Black Lightning was introduced to the Arrowverse, Blake Neely's score, and the Lucifer cameo, ultimately giving the episode an 8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNFlashReview\" /> Agard said with the Earth-90 Flash's death, the episode achieved the \"clever way to save Grant Gustin from that fate while also wrapping up that thread in a way that was satisfying and didn't feel like a complete cheat\". He was also glad that J'onn J'onnz and Iris West were having more substantial roles in the crossover than previous ones in which they had been sidelined or underutilized. To Agard, the introduction of Black Lightning was \"the definition of delayed gratification. Seeing Cress interact with everyone in this scene was something to behold because we've been waiting for it to happen and, more importantly, the script does a good job of synthesizing who this guy is to non-''Black Lightning'' viewers.\" Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", Agard concluded, \"Overall, I kind of loved this episode. Sure, it definitely moved a bit too quickly and I lost track of the story at times. But it had an immense heart to it. Not only that, but it also improved on what Part 2 did.\"<ref name=\"EWFlashReview\" />\n\n''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Scott Von Doviak also awarded the episode an \"A\u2013\", saying the crossover is \"a hot mess, there's no question about it. To call it overstuffed would be an understatement{{nbsp}}... There are five-minute subplots here that could have been entire episodes of the various series making up the Arrowverse, and the whole thing feels like it could fly apart like the Flash on the cosmic treadmill at any moment. But that's what makes it so much fun.\" Von Doviak called the purgatory subplot one of the ones that felt rushed, and the killing of Earth-90 Flash made \"all the angst of the first half of the season feel a little cheap\". As for the episode's ending, Von Doviak said it was \"kind of a ripoff of ''Avengers: Infinity War''\" especially since he predicted all of it would be reversed in the final installments, \"but as far as cliffhangers to hold us until after the holidays go, it'll do.\"<ref name=\"AVClubFlashReview\" /> Awarding the episode 5 out of 5 stars, Mike Cecchini from ''Den of Geek'' felt the crossover and this episode succeeded in \"deliver[ing] 100+ episodes worth of emotional and narrative payoff\" and being \"the climax of the single most ambitious crossover in television history\".<ref name=\"DenOfGeekFlashReview\" />\n\n====''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 79% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the ''Arrow'' episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"{{'}}s fourth installment reshuffles the universe in rousing fashion thanks to ''Arrow'' himself and a delightful cameo from Ezra Miller, even if repeating the same sacrifice twice dilutes the impact of this farewell to Oliver Queen.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arrow/s08/e08|title=Arrow \u2013 Season 8 Episode 8|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref> For the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 5 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/dc_s_legends_of_tomorrow/s05/e01|title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow \u2013 Season 5 Episode 1|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen gave the final two installments a 9 out of 10 saying, \"The final two chapters of 'Crisis on Infinite Earths' cement this crossover as the most entertaining and most ambitious Arrowverse adventure yet.\" After fearing the crossover would buckle under its weight in Part 3, Schedeen was glad in the ''Arrow'' episode that the \"consolidating [of] the cast down to a handful of heroes and a few cosmic entities really help[ed] refocus and remind viewers of what's at stake.\" He also liked seeing the human side of the Monitor, but could not say the same for the Anti-Monitor, who was just \"a faceless threat and an obligatory, all-powerful punching bag in these final two episodes.\" Schedeen called Oliver's sacrifice \"a fitting end\" to the character stating, \"These final two episodes more than justify the decision to resurrect Ollie after his heroic sacrifice in Part 1. They do even more to bring the character full circle and complete his arc. Ollie's story has always been about the sacrifices he makes for the greater good and what better way to end that story than by having the Arrowverse's first hero give his life so that its best heroes can continue the fight?\" For the ''Legends'' episode, he felt the \"finale manages to deftly balance the whimsical, self-aware tone of ''Legends'' with the gravitas needed as our heroes confront the Anti-Monitor one last time.\" Schedeen also added Part 5 \"manages to juggle its many moving parts elegantly\" and he enjoyed the ending sequence and the creation of the Arrowverse's version of the Justice League.<ref name=\"IGNArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nFor Part 4, Agard felt the Speed Force flashbacks were \"very cheesy and reminiscent of things ''Arrow'' has done in the past. On the other hand, I found it very effective in putting us in the mindset for the final battle and, more importantly, the end of ''Arrow''{{nbsp}}... [T]his episode honors his connection to the other shows and how this one show\u2019s existence has created so much.\" He added Oliver's death in this episode \"packed way more of an emotional punch [over the one in Part 1] because of the three actors\u2019 performances.\" With the ''Legends'' episode, Agard was \"surprised by how strong\" it was, noting, \"[t]he last episode of a crossover is usually the weakest because the big battle ends up taking precedence over character moments, but that\u2019s not the case here at all.\" The episodes were given an \"A\u2013\" by Agard.<ref name=\"EWArrowLegendsReview\" /> Delia Harrington at ''Den of Geek'' felt the final two episodes were \"very different, but equally compelling\". She praised the performances by Amell and Benoist and enjoyed all of the cameos and Easter eggs in the final episodes. She, like Agard, was more approving of Oliver's death in these episodes saying it \"was much more in line with what his character deserved\". For Part 5, Harrington said \"The governing principle of this episode was the banana pants aesthetic of ''Legends'', and that\u2019s exactly what it needed,\" pointing out the appearance of the giant Beebo. Giving the episodes 4 out of 5 stars, she concluded, \"for those of us who were touting ''Arrow'' as the best superhero property on any screen, big or small, back in Season 1, this is truly the television equivalent to ''Endgame''-level storytelling. Some of the old heroes are gone. New heroes rise in their place. The fandom mourns, but we also get to celebrate all the new stories there are to tell.\"<ref name=\"DenOfGeekArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nKate Kulzick of ''The A.V. Club'' was more negative on the ''Arrow'' episode, giving it a \"C\u2013\". She said, \"''Arrow''{{'}}s contribution to the crossover not only fails to live up to the dramatic stakes of that cliffhanger, it sours the goodwill generated by the first three episodes, retreading old ground and sending the crossover limping into its finale.\" Kulzick was disappointed more explanation was not given to how the Monitor and Ant-Monitor received their god-like powers. She also called the Speed Force moments \"arbitrary\" it what could have been \"a wonderful opportunity to relive and re-imagine high points from each of the Arrowverse shows\u2019 histories.\" Getting to the final battle between the Paragons and Anti-Monitor was where Kulzick felt the episode \"really starts to flounder\". Unlike Agard and Harrington, Kulzick felt Oliver's death was \"a pale shadow of the raw and emotional end of part one\" and \"one hell of a disappointing way to send out Oliver Queen\".<ref name=\"AVClubArrowReview\" /> For the ''Legends'' episode, ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Allison Shoemaker felt some of the concepts in the episode were \"flimsy\" adding, \"The plot is fine. The characters and their reactions to what\u2019s happened, to that loss and the new status quo, is what really hits home.\" The highlight character moment to Shoemaker was Barry and Sara's conversation, followed by Sara and Diggle's. She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubLegendsReview\" />\n\n==''Crisis Aftermath''==\n''Crisis Aftermath'' is an [[aftershow]] that aired after the December 8 ''Supergirl'' episode and the December 10 ''The Flash'' episode. The show went \"in-depth to explore\" the crossover, and was hosted by [[Kevin Smith]].<ref name=\"Aftershow\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' helped develop the special. The show featured discussions with executive producers Guggenheim, Dries, Rovner, Shimizu, and Wallace; stars Cryer, Garrett, McNamara, and Conroy; and panel guest Dani Fernandez, among others.

It is the flagship property of [[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc.]], which is owned by [[MediaQuest Holdings]], the multimedia arm of [[Philippines|Philippine-based]] telecommunications company [[PLDT]]. \n5 is also formally referred to as \"The ''Kapatid'' Network\", the [[Filipino language|Tagalog]] term for \"sibling\", which was introduced in 2010.\n\nNamed after its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWET-TV]], which are carried in VHF Channel 5 (analog broadcast) and UHF Channel 51 (digital test broadcast; though the latter is licensed to TV5's sister company [[Cignal TV|Mediascape/Cignal TV]])  with channel 18 served as a permanent assigned digital frequency. 5 is also broadcasting to 7 other owned-and-operated stations, and 19 affiliated television stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through [[Kapatid Channel]] and [[AksyonTV|AksyonTV International]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|TV5 Network}}\n\n===The early years (1960\u20131972)===\n[[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]], owner of the [[Manila Times]] was granted of a radio-TV franchise from [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] under [[Republic Act]] 2945 on 19 June 1960.<ref name=\"ra2945\" /> He then founded the Associated Broadcasting Corporation with its first studios along Pasong Tamo, becoming the fourth television network established in the country. ABC operated radio and television services from 1960 until 23 September 1972 when [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] declared [[Ferdinand E. Marcos#Martial law and the New Society|Martial Law]]. Both ABC and the [[Manila Times]] were forcibly shut down as a result with rivals [[ABS-CBN]], [[GMA Network|RBS]], and [[Manila Broadcasting Company|MBC]]'s radio and television broadcasts also shut down by martial law that day.\n\nAfter the [[People Power Revolution]] in 1986, Chino Roces made a successful representation with [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino]] for the network's reinstatement. ABC's rival [[ABS-CBN]] reopened that year but ABC was not yet reopened until it made a test broadcast in 1991 and finally reopened in 1992. Chino Roces died in 1988, but his son Edgardo Roces would reopen the network after.\n\nNew stockholders led by broadcast veteran Edward Tan and Chino Roces's son Edgardo then began the arduous task of resuming broadcasts. The [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] granted their application for an increase in capitalization and amendments to ABC's articles of incorporation and by-laws. They were subsequently granted a permit to operate by the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)]].\n\n===The return and growth (1992\u20132003)===\nABC inaugurated its studio complex and transmitter tower in San Bartolome, [[Novaliches]], [[Quezon City]] in 1990 and began test broadcasts by the end of 1991; officially and finally returning to the air as the Associated Broadcasting Company on 21 February 1992 with the different callsign of the flagship station, DWET-TV and the corporate name, Associated Broadcasting Company, which the Company uses C as the corporate initial instead of keeping Corporation, the name of the original ABC, along its original callsign, DZTM-TV, during the pre-martial law years as a result of the new management of the now revived network which took over its operations.\n\nABC acquired a new 25-year franchise to operate on 9 December 1994 under [[Republic Act]] 7831 (will expire on 9 December 2019) signed by President [[Fidel V. Ramos|Fidel Valdez Ramos]]. In the same year, it went on nationwide satellite broadcasting. In a surge of phenomenal growth, ABC earned its reputation as \"The Fastest Growing Network\" under new network executive [[Tina Monzon-Palma]] who served as Chief Operating Officer.\n\nIn 2001, ABC began to produce local versions of ''[[The Price Is Right]]'' (hosted by [[Dawn Zulueta]] and later acquired by [[ABS-CBN]]); ''[[Wheel of Fortune (game show) in different countries|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (hosted by [[Rustom Padilla]], later acquired by [[ABS-CBN]]); and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (hosted by [[Ogie Alcasid]], later acquired by [[GMA Network]] and then by [[ABS-CBN]]). This was during the height of the game show frenzy within Philippine networks brought on by the success of [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]]'s Philippine editions of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' (hosted by [[Christopher de Leon]], which is later transferred to TV5 hosted by [[Vic Sotto]]) and ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' (hosted by [[Edu Manzano]]).\n\n===The Cojuangco era (2003\u20132008)===\nIn October 2003, ABC was acquired by a group led by businessman Antonio \"Tonyboy\" O. Cojuangco, Jr. former Chairman of the [[PLDT|Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]] (PLDT) and owner of [[Dream Satellite TV|Dream Satellite Broadcasting]] and Bank of Commerce, among other assets. Cojuangco was the chairman and CEO of ABC at the time. The new management introduced many changes including a stronger news and public affairs division, modernization of its broadcast equipment, and the acquisition of broadcast rights of [[Philippine Basketball Association]] games. Additionally, the network also launched a new advertising campaign and slogan, \"Iba Tayo!\" (\"We're Different!\"), which emphasized the new lineup as being more distinct and new than what was being aired by its competitors at the time, targeting the burgeoning middle- to upper-class youth market.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jazmines|first1=Tessa|title=DTH station buys terrestrial TV channel|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/markets-festivals/dth-station-buys-terrestrial-tv-channel-1117896313/|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=30 November 2003}}</ref> ABC continued to support [[Family Rosary Crusade (TV program)|Family Rosary Crusade]], and its religious pre-identification campaign \"Please Pray the Rosary\" was played before every program on the network until the plug gradually phased out due to the network's programming revamp.\n\nIn 2005, ABC won the \"Outstanding TV Station\" award at the 2005 [[Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas|KBP Golden Dove Awards]], with several other programs on the network also earning awards in their respective categories.\n\nIn early 2007, ABC implemented a series of [[budget cut]]s, primarily directed towards its news department, which laid off most of its employees. The cuts, held prior to the [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 general elections]], left ABC almost incapable of coverage.\n\nIn November 2007, ABC debuted an array of new sports programming, including [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] basketball, pro boxing, and [[WWE]] events, as part of a new five-year deal with [[Solar Entertainment Corporation|Solar Entertainment]]. However, due to their high costs and poor ratings, these programs were later dropped throughout 2008, and its NBA review show \"House of Hoops\" was cut back as well and eventually cancelled by April 2008. However, much of these programs, along with the PBA (as ABC elected not to renew its contract through the ended after the [[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference|2008 Fiesta Conference]]), would be picked up by [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], who had begun a much wider partnership with Solar earlier in 2007, which led to its privatization by the latter in 2011.\n\n===TV5 era (2008\u20132018)===\n\n==== ABC-MPB Primedia Partnership (2008\u20132010) ====\nIn March 2008, Cojuangco announced that ABC had reached a partnership with MPB Primedia Inc., a local company backed by [[Media Prima|Media Prima Berhad]] of [[Malaysia]] as part of a long-term strategy to make the network more competitive. MPB Primedia, meanwhile, was formed to serve as seed asset for Media Prima's proposed private equity fund to invest in various media companies within Southeast Asia.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2009/10/14/media-prima-set-to-exit-philippine-tv/ Media Prima set to exit Philippine TV] Accessed 8 October 2018</ref> Cojuangco said MPB Primedia Inc., in principle, would produce and source most of the entertainment programs while ABC would continue to be responsible for news programming and operation of the stations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.com.ph/features/features032808_aoc.html|title=ABC Signs Content Partnership with Malaysia-Backed Group|publisher=ABC.com.ph|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727012656/http://abc.com.ph/features/features032808_aoc.html|archivedate=27 July 2008}}</ref> MPB Primedia was also given exclusive right to schedule and manage sale of ABC-5's airtime.

This forced the network to implement a series of retrenchment of its employees. The biggest retrenchment happened in September 2015, when TV5's entertainment division got on the verge of dissolution and its employees were laid off, including [[Wilma Galvante]], its Chief Entertainment Content Officer. From 4,000 employees in mid-2013, the series of retrenchment resizes TV5 to merely around 700 employees by the end of 2017.\n\nIncapable of producing original content, TV5 appointed [[Viva Entertainment]] CEO, Vicente \"Vic\" Del Rosario as the network's new Chief Entertainment Strategist, implementing changes on TV5's entertainment programming. These included a formation of the Viva-TV5 joint venture [[Sari-Sari Channel]] and outsourcing [[Viva Entertainment|Viva Television]] for its entertainment shows, including [[Ang Panday (2016 TV series)|a revival of ''Ang Panday'']], the return of [[Diether Ocampo]] and [[Claudine Barretto]]'s tandem in ''[[Bakit Manipis ang Ulap?]]'' and shows from by-then sister station [[MTV Pinoy]] such as ''Top 20 Pilipinas''. New shows started to air between November 2015 and February 2016 but were cancelled a few months later due to lack of advertisement support and poor ratings.\n\nSince January 2016, TV5 and [[Cignal]] via [[Hyper (TV channel)|Hyper]] will be the official Free TV and Pay TV partner, respectively, of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] in the Philippines.\n\nBy July 2016, TV5 began airing selected programs from [[MTV]] and [[MTV International]] like ''[[Catfish]]'', ''[[Ridiculousness (TV series)|Ridiculousness]]'' and ''[[Ex on the Beach]]'' after inking a deal with [[Viacom International Media Networks]] that month to create the new MTV on TV5 block.\n\nOn 8 September 2016, TV5 cancelled its locally produced programs ''[[Aksyon Bisaya]]'' (Cebu) and ''[[Aksyon Dabaw]]'' (Davao) due to cost-cutting measures. With this move, the personnel remained employed as they will continue file reports for ''[[Aksyon]]'' newscasts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/local-news/2016/09/09/cost-cutting-leaves-tv5-cebu-journalists-workers-limbo-496590|title=Cost cutting leaves TV5 Cebu journalists, workers in limbo|publisher=[[Sun.Star Cebu]]|last=Baquero|first=Elias O.|date=8 September 2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 September 2016, TV5 President and CEO Emmanuel \"Noel\" C. Lorenzana stepped down from his position. He was replaced by basketball coach and Sports5/D5 Studio head, Vicente \"Chot\" Reyes the following day. Following his appointment, the network announced it would be retrenching around 200 employees as part of TV5's digitalization.\n\nIn April 2017, TV5 acquired the rights to air the [[WWE]] after [[Fox Channel Asia|Fox Philippines]] decision to not renew its contract with the WWE due to unknown reasons. The network previously handle the rights from 2007\u201308 and 2010.\n\nOn 12 October 2017, TV5 Network announced its partnership with [[ESPN]], licensing its PBA, UFC, PSL and NFL rights and giving TV5 access to ESPN programs and content. The partnership formed the '''ESPN5''' brand, that is airing on TV5 and [[AksyonTV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=TV5 and ESPN collaborate to launch ESPN 5|url=http://sports.tv5.com.ph/sports5/article/tv5-and-espn-collaborate-to-launch-espn-5|work=Sports5|publisher=[[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc.]]|date=11 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012201619/http://sports.tv5.com.ph/sports5/article/tv5-and-espn-collaborate-to-launch-espn-5|archivedate=12 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Interaksyon|title=ESPN-5 IS HERE &#124; TV5 announces partnership with \u2018Worldwide Leader in Sports\u2019|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/sports/2017/10/12/102970/espn-5-is-here-tv5-announces-partnership-with-worldwide-leader-in-sports/|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=Interaksyon|publisher=Philstar Global Corporation|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> The said deal comes in response to the network's formal, albeit temporary shift from a general entertainment station to a sports and news channel.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mercurio|first1=Richmond|title=TV5 narrows losses in 2018|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2019/01/11/1883955/tv5-narrows-losses-2018|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=[[The Philippine Star|Philstar.com]]|publisher=Philstar Global Corp.|date=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== The 5 Network era (2018\u20132020) ===\nOn 17 February 2018, in line with the recent changes within the network and in celebration of its 10th anniversary, TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply '''5''' with a new logo and station ID entitled ''Get It on 5'', whereas the TV on the top right quadrant of the logo has been dropped, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity. Aside from rebranding, TV5's programming grid has also divided into three blocks: ESPN5 (Sports), News 5, and On 5 (Entertainment, Anime, Cartoons, Informative and Home TV Shopping), along with D5 Studio (Digital Content) and Studio 5 (World-class Filipino productions for audiences across all platforms). Along with the rebrand, the ''Kapatid'' moniker was also deemphasized and is now only used by News5 and ESPN5 for some of its programs. But the more visible change was the slow quiet phraseout of Filipino-dubbed movies and foreign-acquired programming, a feature that dated back from its MPB Primedia era in 2008. Today, even more of its ''Disney Club on 5'' programs and more of its movies are now aired in the English language.\n\nOn 13 January 2019, coinciding with the reformat of [[AksyonTV]] to [[5 Plus]], 5 introduced a variation of its 2018 logo. It has also since included the websites of the division producing the program airing (e.g. TV5.com.ph for entertainment and blocktimers) as part of their on-screen graphics.\n\nOn 3 June 2019, [[Chot Reyes]] retired as TV5 President and CEO, which was immediately replaced by Jane Basas, which leads pay-TV provider and radio company [[Cignal TV|Cignal TV/Mediascape]]. Since her appointment, 5 has begun to outsource news and sports programming from its co-owned Cignal channels [[One News (Philippines)|One News]], [[One PH]], [[One Sports (Philippines)|One Sports]], and [[PBA Rush]]; it has also phased out its daytime [[ESPN5]] programs and relegated it to sister free-TV station [[5 Plus]] in favor of archived entertainment programs and expanded movie blocks. Jane Basas later revealed future plans for the network; which includes retaining its existing news programs and sports content in primetime, and reintroducing original entertainment programming through outsourcing from [[Cignal TV#Cignal Entertainment|Cignal Entertainment]] and other major blocktimers. The network also saw the return of former TV5 executive Perci Intalan as the station's head of programming in November.\n\nTV5 Network got its  25-year franchise extension under [[Republic Act]] 11320 but lapsed-into-law on 22 April 2019 without President [[Rodrigo Duterte|Rodrigo Roa Duterte]]'s signature coincided with the 25-year franchise extension of [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines|CBCP]] under [[Republic Act]] 11319 also lapsed-into-law on that same day  without Chief Executive's signature.\n\nOn 4 February 2020, Robert P. Galang has been appointed as the new President and CEO of TV5 Network and [[Cignal TV]], replacing Basas who has been appointed as the new Chief Marketing Officer of [[Smart Communications]].\n\nOn 8 March 2020, 5's sister channel [[5 Plus]] was relaunched as [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports]] (moving from being a Cignal-exclusive pay television channel), with the ESPN5 division also being renamed and merged to the abovementioned brand. As a result, all sports programming on 5 no longer bears the ''ESPN5'' banner. Despite the change, the ESPN5 partnership continues online, with ESPN5.com serving as the de-facto sports portal of One Sports and ESPN in the Philippines. On the same day, TV5 Network announced that 5 would be rebranded as '''One TV''' (adopting from Cignal TV's \"One\"-branded channels) on 13 April 2020. However, if the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]] and the Luzon-wide community quarantine extends, the rebranding will be moved to either 2nd or 3rd Quarter 2020.\n\n==Branding of 5==\n===Network identity===\nOn 19 June 1960, newspaper publisher [[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]] launched its television station in the Philippines, then known as the Associated Broadcasting Corporation.<ref name=\"ra2945\" /> Since then, the network evolved and used different brandings until it became widely known from what it is today.\n\n:*'''Associated Broadcasting Corporation''' (1960\u20131972) \u2014 founded by [[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]] until it was forced to shut down in 1972 following the declaration of the [[Ferdinand E. Marcos#Martial law and the New Society|Martial Law]] by President Marcos.\n:*'''Associated Broadcasting Company''' (1992\u20132008) \u2014 fully restored after being granted a new franchise led by its new stockholders Edward Tan and Roces' son, Edgardo Roces. It was acquired by businessman Antonio O. Cojuangco Jr. in 2003.\n:*'''TV5''' (2008\u20132018) \u2014 renamed as TV5 after ABC entered a partnership with MPB Primedia, Inc. backed by the Malaysian media group [[Media Prima|Media Prima Berhad]]. In 2010, [[Media Prima]] divested its share with [[MediaQuest Holdings|MediaQuest Holdings, Inc.]] to business tycoon [[Manuel V. Pangilinan]]. Upon relaunch as ''5'', the TV5 branding became obsolete, only to be used during station sign-on and sign-off messages, social media accounts, and selected program teasers.\n:*'''5 (The 5 Network)''' (2018\u20132020) \u2014 TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply ''5'' on 17 February 2018. The station launched its numerical 5 logo, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity, as its programming grid is divided into news, sports, and entertainment. Although, '''TV5''' was still used to refer to both the channel and the company itself.\n:*'''One TV''' (2Q/3Q 2020) - 5 will be relaunched as One TV starting on the 2nd or 3rd Quarter of 2020. This will make them the 6th TV station under PLDT-Smart's MediaQuest to take the \"One\" branding.\n\n===Logos===\nTV5 used several logos since it was established in 1960. In 1960, the network used a 5 Logo derived from its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWET-TV|DZTM-TV]] carried in VHF channel 5 until it was shut down in 1972. When it returned to the airwaves, the network used a more-known ABC 5 logo with an iconic cyclone icon, incorporating the colors [[red]], [[blue]] and [[green]]\u2014colors making up a [[pixel]] shown on the [[television]] technology of 1992. The number 5 was removed to the logo in 1995 but retaining its ABC and the cyclone icon. In 2001, the logo added its slogan Come home to ABC, the same logo used in April 2004 with its new slogan Iba Tayo. The last logo as ABC in September 2004 has been enclosed with a yellow circle. The logo changed after its re-launch in 2008 having the new name of the network TV5 inside a shaking television. In 2010, the network used a red circle being shined in the northwest corner carrying the name TV5 with the letters TV in the northeastern part above the largely sized number 5. The logo adopted a 3D version in 2013 and applying it on-air, although the 2010 2D version oftentimes appear.\n\nIn 2018, TV5 adopted its numerical 5 logo, which was first appeared on [[ESPN5]] logo, which was launched on October 2017, dropping the \"TV\" word on the northeastern quadrant as part of their ''Get It on 5'' campaign. They also started to display the name of the current program using the format: \"(title) ''on 5''\" as the part of the logo (usually applied to entertainment and other programs not provided by either News5 or ESPN5; except blocktimers, where only the 5 logo is displayed) resulting to viewers mistakenly thought \"on\" was part of the title. The numerical five logo was also simultaneously adopted for TV5 sister divisions [[News5]], [[DWFM|Radyo 5]], and [[Digital5|D5 Studio]].\n\nA variation of the current numerical 5 logo was unveiled on 13 January 2019, similar to the newly launched network, [[5 Plus]].\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by 5 (TV channel)}}\n5's program lineup includes news and current affairs programs, dubbed cartoons, movies, American drama, sports, informative, talk shows, infomercials and Japanese anime shows.\n\nOn its second month since its re-launch last 9 August 2008, TV5 has been reportedly on Top 3 based on the [[AGB Nielsen Philippines|AGB Nielsen]] survey. It also gained its rating on their ''Nick on TV5'' morning cartoon block, and its popularity because of their former AniMEGA primetime anime block.\n\nIn 2013, the network's ratings improved as they launched the Weekend Do It Better and Everyday All The Way programming blocks under the helm of the former Chief Entertainment Content Officer, [[Wilma Galvante]] (2012\u20132015), however some of the programs under the block were discontinued, particularly due to low ratings.\n\nIn 2014, the network launched another set of new programs under the \"Happy Ka Dito!\" campaign.\n\nIn 2015, TV5 launched more than a dozen programs that are more focused to light entertainment and sports programming under its \"Happy sa 2015\" campaign. Also the said year, viewers sought the return of AniMEGA.\n\nMonths later, TV5's entertainment programming were produced by different content providers, including Unitel Productions (TV5's sister company), The IdeaFirst Company (formed by former TV5 Entertainment Head Perci Intalan) and Content Cows Company Inc. (formed by Galvante). By 14 October 2015, TV5 Network named [[Sari-Sari Channel|Sari-Sari Network]] as the main production outfit of TV5. They also appointed SSN Co-CEO and [[Viva Entertainment|Viva]] executive, Vicente \"Vic\" Del Rosario as the new Chief Entertainment Strategist of the network. He will handle all of the entertainment programs broadcast by the network. It happened a month after TV5, Cignal and Viva inked a deal to create [[Sari-Sari Channel|Sari-Sari Network]] (SSN). New shows for 2016 were also launched by TV5 together with [[Viva Entertainment]] last 25 November 2015.

It is the flagship property of [[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc.]], which is owned by [[MediaQuest Holdings]], the multimedia arm of [[Philippines|Philippine-based]] telecommunications company [[PLDT]]. \n5 is also formally referred to as \"The ''Kapatid'' Network\", the [[Filipino language|Tagalog]] term for \"sibling\", which was introduced in 2010.\n\nNamed after its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWET-TV]], which are carried in VHF Channel 5 (analog broadcast) and UHF Channel 51 (digital test broadcast; though the latter is licensed to TV5's sister company [[Cignal TV|Mediascape/Cignal TV]])  with channel 18 served as a permanent assigned digital frequency. 5 is also broadcasting to 7 other owned-and-operated stations, and 19 affiliated television stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through [[Kapatid Channel]] and [[AksyonTV|AksyonTV International]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|TV5 Network}}\n\n===The early years (1960\u20131972)===\n[[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]], owner of the [[Manila Times]] was granted of a radio-TV franchise from [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] under [[Republic Act]] 2945 on 19 June 1960.<ref name=\"ra2945\" /> He then founded the Associated Broadcasting Corporation with its first studios along Pasong Tamo, becoming the fourth television network established in the country. ABC operated radio and television services from 1960 until 23 September 1972 when [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] declared [[Ferdinand E. Marcos#Martial law and the New Society|Martial Law]]. Both ABC and the [[Manila Times]] were forcibly shut down as a result with rivals [[ABS-CBN]], [[GMA Network|RBS]], and [[Manila Broadcasting Company|MBC]]'s radio and television broadcasts also shut down by martial law that day.\n\nAfter the [[People Power Revolution]] in 1986, Chino Roces made a successful representation with [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino]] for the network's reinstatement. ABC's rival [[ABS-CBN]] reopened that year but ABC was not yet reopened until it made a test broadcast in 1991 and finally reopened in 1992. Chino Roces died in 1988, but his son Edgardo Roces would reopen the network after.\n\nNew stockholders led by broadcast veteran Edward Tan and Chino Roces's son Edgardo then began the arduous task of resuming broadcasts. The [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] granted their application for an increase in capitalization and amendments to ABC's articles of incorporation and by-laws. They were subsequently granted a permit to operate by the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)]].\n\n===The return and growth (1992\u20132003)===\nABC inaugurated its studio complex and transmitter tower in San Bartolome, [[Novaliches]], [[Quezon City]] in 1990 and began test broadcasts by the end of 1991; officially and finally returning to the air as the Associated Broadcasting Company on 21 February 1992 with the different callsign of the flagship station, DWET-TV and the corporate name, Associated Broadcasting Company, which the Company uses C as the corporate initial instead of keeping Corporation, the name of the original ABC, along its original callsign, DZTM-TV, during the pre-martial law years as a result of the new management of the now revived network which took over its operations.\n\nABC acquired a new 25-year franchise to operate on 9 December 1994 under [[Republic Act]] 7831 (will expire on 9 December 2019) signed by President [[Fidel V. Ramos|Fidel Valdez Ramos]]. In the same year, it went on nationwide satellite broadcasting. In a surge of phenomenal growth, ABC earned its reputation as \"The Fastest Growing Network\" under new network executive [[Tina Monzon-Palma]] who served as Chief Operating Officer.\n\nIn 2001, ABC began to produce local versions of ''[[The Price Is Right]]'' (hosted by [[Dawn Zulueta]] and later acquired by [[ABS-CBN]]); ''[[Wheel of Fortune (game show) in different countries|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (hosted by [[Rustom Padilla]], later acquired by [[ABS-CBN]]); and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (hosted by [[Ogie Alcasid]], later acquired by [[GMA Network]] and then by [[ABS-CBN]]). This was during the height of the game show frenzy within Philippine networks brought on by the success of [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]]'s Philippine editions of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' (hosted by [[Christopher de Leon]], which is later transferred to TV5 hosted by [[Vic Sotto]]) and ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' (hosted by [[Edu Manzano]]).\n\n===The Cojuangco era (2003\u20132008)===\nIn October 2003, ABC was acquired by a group led by businessman Antonio \"Tonyboy\" O. Cojuangco, Jr. former Chairman of the [[PLDT|Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]] (PLDT) and owner of [[Dream Satellite TV|Dream Satellite Broadcasting]] and Bank of Commerce, among other assets. Cojuangco was the chairman and CEO of ABC at the time. The new management introduced many changes including a stronger news and public affairs division, modernization of its broadcast equipment, and the acquisition of broadcast rights of [[Philippine Basketball Association]] games. Additionally, the network also launched a new advertising campaign and slogan, \"Iba Tayo!\" (\"We're Different!\"), which emphasized the new lineup as being more distinct and new than what was being aired by its competitors at the time, targeting the burgeoning middle- to upper-class youth market.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jazmines|first1=Tessa|title=DTH station buys terrestrial TV channel|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/markets-festivals/dth-station-buys-terrestrial-tv-channel-1117896313/|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=30 November 2003}}</ref> ABC continued to support [[Family Rosary Crusade (TV program)|Family Rosary Crusade]], and its religious pre-identification campaign \"Please Pray the Rosary\" was played before every program on the network until the plug gradually phased out due to the network's programming revamp.\n\nIn 2005, ABC won the \"Outstanding TV Station\" award at the 2005 [[Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas|KBP Golden Dove Awards]], with several other programs on the network also earning awards in their respective categories.\n\nIn early 2007, ABC implemented a series of [[budget cut]]s, primarily directed towards its news department, which laid off most of its employees. The cuts, held prior to the [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 general elections]], left ABC almost incapable of coverage.\n\nIn November 2007, ABC debuted an array of new sports programming, including [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] basketball, pro boxing, and [[WWE]] events, as part of a new five-year deal with [[Solar Entertainment Corporation|Solar Entertainment]]. However, due to their high costs and poor ratings, these programs were later dropped throughout 2008, and its NBA review show \"House of Hoops\" was cut back as well and eventually cancelled by April 2008. However, much of these programs, along with the PBA (as ABC elected not to renew its contract through the ended after the [[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference|2008 Fiesta Conference]]), would be picked up by [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], who had begun a much wider partnership with Solar earlier in 2007, which led to its privatization by the latter in 2011.\n\n===TV5 era (2008\u20132018)===\n\n==== ABC-MPB Primedia Partnership (2008\u20132010) ====\nIn March 2008, Cojuangco announced that ABC had reached a partnership with MPB Primedia Inc., a local company backed by [[Media Prima|Media Prima Berhad]] of [[Malaysia]] as part of a long-term strategy to make the network more competitive. MPB Primedia, meanwhile, was formed to serve as seed asset for Media Prima's proposed private equity fund to invest in various media companies within Southeast Asia.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2009/10/14/media-prima-set-to-exit-philippine-tv/ Media Prima set to exit Philippine TV] Accessed 8 October 2018</ref> Cojuangco said MPB Primedia Inc., in principle, would produce and source most of the entertainment programs while ABC would continue to be responsible for news programming and operation of the stations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.com.ph/features/features032808_aoc.html|title=ABC Signs Content Partnership with Malaysia-Backed Group|publisher=ABC.com.ph|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727012656/http://abc.com.ph/features/features032808_aoc.html|archivedate=27 July 2008}}</ref> MPB Primedia was also given exclusive right to schedule and manage sale of ABC-5's airtime.

This forced the network to implement a series of retrenchment of its employees. The biggest retrenchment happened in September 2015, when TV5's entertainment division got on the verge of dissolution and its employees were laid off, including [[Wilma Galvante]], its Chief Entertainment Content Officer. From 4,000 employees in mid-2013, the series of retrenchment resizes TV5 to merely around 700 employees by the end of 2017.\n\nIncapable of producing original content, TV5 appointed [[Viva Entertainment]] CEO, Vicente \"Vic\" Del Rosario as the network's new Chief Entertainment Strategist, implementing changes on TV5's entertainment programming. These included a formation of the Viva-TV5 joint venture [[Sari-Sari Channel]] and outsourcing [[Viva Entertainment|Viva Television]] for its entertainment shows, including [[Ang Panday (2016 TV series)|a revival of ''Ang Panday'']], the return of [[Diether Ocampo]] and [[Claudine Barretto]]'s tandem in ''[[Bakit Manipis ang Ulap?]]'' and shows from by-then sister station [[MTV Pinoy]] such as ''Top 20 Pilipinas''. New shows started to air between November 2015 and February 2016 but were cancelled a few months later due to lack of advertisement support and poor ratings.\n\nSince January 2016, TV5 and [[Cignal]] via [[Hyper (TV channel)|Hyper]] will be the official Free TV and Pay TV partner, respectively, of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] in the Philippines.\n\nBy July 2016, TV5 began airing selected programs from [[MTV]] and [[MTV International]] like ''[[Catfish]]'', ''[[Ridiculousness (TV series)|Ridiculousness]]'' and ''[[Ex on the Beach]]'' after inking a deal with [[Viacom International Media Networks]] that month to create the new MTV on TV5 block.\n\nOn 8 September 2016, TV5 cancelled its locally produced programs ''[[Aksyon Bisaya]]'' (Cebu) and ''[[Aksyon Dabaw]]'' (Davao) due to cost-cutting measures. With this move, the personnel remained employed as they will continue file reports for ''[[Aksyon]]'' newscasts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/local-news/2016/09/09/cost-cutting-leaves-tv5-cebu-journalists-workers-limbo-496590|title=Cost cutting leaves TV5 Cebu journalists, workers in limbo|publisher=[[Sun.Star Cebu]]|last=Baquero|first=Elias O.|date=8 September 2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 September 2016, TV5 President and CEO Emmanuel \"Noel\" C.

Following his appointment, the network announced it would be retrenching around 200 employees as part of TV5's digitalization.\n\nIn April 2017, TV5 acquired the rights to air the [[WWE]] after [[Fox Channel Asia|Fox Philippines]] decision to not renew its contract with the WWE due to unknown reasons.

The partnership formed the '''ESPN5''' brand, that is airing on TV5 and [[AksyonTV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=TV5 and ESPN collaborate to launch ESPN 5|url=http://sports.tv5.com.ph/sports5/article/tv5-and-espn-collaborate-to-launch-espn-5|work=Sports5|publisher=[[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc.]]|date=11 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012201619/http://sports.tv5.com.ph/sports5/article/tv5-and-espn-collaborate-to-launch-espn-5|archivedate=12 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Interaksyon|title=ESPN-5 IS HERE &#124; TV5 announces partnership with \u2018Worldwide Leader in Sports\u2019|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/sports/2017/10/12/102970/espn-5-is-here-tv5-announces-partnership-with-worldwide-leader-in-sports/|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=Interaksyon|publisher=Philstar Global Corporation|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> The said deal comes in response to the network's formal, albeit temporary shift from a general entertainment station to a sports and news channel.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mercurio|first1=Richmond|title=TV5 narrows losses in 2018|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2019/01/11/1883955/tv5-narrows-losses-2018|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=[[The Philippine Star|Philstar.com]]|publisher=Philstar Global Corp.|date=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== The 5 Network era (2018\u20132020) ===\nOn 17 February 2018, in line with the recent changes within the network and in celebration of its 10th anniversary, TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply '''5''' with a new logo and station ID entitled ''Get It on 5'', whereas the TV on the top right quadrant of the logo has been dropped, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity. Aside from rebranding, TV5's programming grid has also divided into three blocks: ESPN5 (Sports), News 5, and On 5 (Entertainment, Anime, Cartoons, Informative and Home TV Shopping), along with D5 Studio (Digital Content) and Studio 5 (World-class Filipino productions for audiences across all platforms). Along with the rebrand, the ''Kapatid'' moniker was also deemphasized and is now only used by News5 and ESPN5 for some of its programs. But the more visible change was the slow quiet phraseout of Filipino-dubbed movies and foreign-acquired programming, a feature that dated back from its MPB Primedia era in 2008. Today, even more of its ''Disney Club on 5'' programs and more of its movies are now aired in the English language.\n\nOn 13 January 2019, coinciding with the reformat of [[AksyonTV]] to [[5 Plus]], 5 introduced a variation of its 2018 logo. It has also since included the websites of the division producing the program airing (e.g. TV5.com.ph for entertainment and blocktimers) as part of their on-screen graphics.\n\nOn 3 June 2019, [[Chot Reyes]] retired as TV5 President and CEO, which was immediately replaced by Jane Basas, which leads pay-TV provider and radio company [[Cignal TV|Cignal TV/Mediascape]]. Since her appointment, 5 has begun to outsource news and sports programming from its co-owned Cignal channels [[One News (Philippines)|One News]], [[One PH]], [[One Sports (Philippines)|One Sports]], and [[PBA Rush]]; it has also phased out its daytime [[ESPN5]] programs and relegated it to sister free-TV station [[5 Plus]] in favor of archived entertainment programs and expanded movie blocks. Jane Basas later revealed future plans for the network; which includes retaining its existing news programs and sports content in primetime, and reintroducing original entertainment programming through outsourcing from [[Cignal TV#Cignal Entertainment|Cignal Entertainment]] and other major blocktimers. The network also saw the return of former TV5 executive Perci Intalan as the station's head of programming in November.\n\nTV5 Network got its  25-year franchise extension under [[Republic Act]] 11320 but lapsed-into-law on 22 April 2019 without President [[Rodrigo Duterte|Rodrigo Roa Duterte]]'s signature coincided with the 25-year franchise extension of [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines|CBCP]] under [[Republic Act]] 11319 also lapsed-into-law on that same day  without Chief Executive's signature.\n\nOn 4 February 2020, Robert P. Galang has been appointed as the new President and CEO of TV5 Network and [[Cignal TV]], replacing Basas who has been appointed as the new Chief Marketing Officer of [[Smart Communications]].\n\nOn 8 March 2020, 5's sister channel [[5 Plus]] was relaunched as [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports]] (moving from being a Cignal-exclusive pay television channel), with the ESPN5 division also being renamed and merged to the abovementioned brand. As a result, all sports programming on 5 no longer bears the ''ESPN5'' banner. Despite the change, the ESPN5 partnership continues online, with ESPN5.com serving as the de-facto sports portal of One Sports and ESPN in the Philippines. On the same day, TV5 Network announced that 5 would be rebranded as '''One TV''' (adopting from Cignal TV's \"One\"-branded channels) on 13 April 2020. However, if the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]] and the Luzon-wide community quarantine extends, the rebranding will be moved to either 2nd or 3rd Quarter 2020.\n\n==Branding of 5==\n===Network identity===\nOn 19 June 1960, newspaper publisher [[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]] launched its television station in the Philippines, then known as the Associated Broadcasting Corporation.<ref name=\"ra2945\" /> Since then, the network evolved and used different brandings until it became widely known from what it is today.\n\n:*'''Associated Broadcasting Corporation''' (1960\u20131972) \u2014 founded by [[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]] until it was forced to shut down in 1972 following the declaration of the [[Ferdinand E. Marcos#Martial law and the New Society|Martial Law]] by President Marcos.\n:*'''Associated Broadcasting Company''' (1992\u20132008) \u2014 fully restored after being granted a new franchise led by its new stockholders Edward Tan and Roces' son, Edgardo Roces. It was acquired by businessman Antonio O. Cojuangco Jr. in 2003.\n:*'''TV5''' (2008\u20132018) \u2014 renamed as TV5 after ABC entered a partnership with MPB Primedia, Inc. backed by the Malaysian media group [[Media Prima|Media Prima Berhad]]. In 2010, [[Media Prima]] divested its share with [[MediaQuest Holdings|MediaQuest Holdings, Inc.]] to business tycoon [[Manuel V. Pangilinan]]. Upon relaunch as ''5'', the TV5 branding became obsolete, only to be used during station sign-on and sign-off messages, social media accounts, and selected program teasers.\n:*'''5 (The 5 Network)''' (2018\u20132020) \u2014 TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply ''5'' on 17 February 2018. The station launched its numerical 5 logo, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity, as its programming grid is divided into news, sports, and entertainment. Although, '''TV5''' was still used to refer to both the channel and the company itself.\n:*'''One TV''' (2Q 2020) - 5 will be relaunched as One TV starting on the 2nd or 3rd Quarter of 2020. This will make them the 6th TV station under PLDT-Smart's MediaQuest to take the \"One\" branding.\n\n===Logos===\nTV5 used several logos since it was established in 1960. In 1960, the network used a 5 Logo derived from its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWET-TV|DZTM-TV]] carried in VHF channel 5 until it was shut down in 1972. When it returned to the airwaves, the network used a more-known ABC 5 logo with an iconic cyclone icon, incorporating the colors [[red]], [[blue]] and [[green]]\u2014colors making up a [[pixel]] shown on the [[television]] technology of 1992. The number 5 was removed to the logo in 1995 but retaining its ABC and the cyclone icon. In 2001, the logo added its slogan Come home to ABC, the same logo used in April 2004 with its new slogan Iba Tayo. The last logo as ABC in September 2004 has been enclosed with a yellow circle. The logo changed after its re-launch in 2008 having the new name of the network TV5 inside a shaking television. In 2010, the network used a red circle being shined in the northwest corner carrying the name TV5 with the letters TV in the northeastern part above the largely sized number 5. The logo adopted a 3D version in 2013 and applying it on-air, although the 2010 2D version oftentimes appear.\n\nIn 2018, TV5 adopted its numerical 5 logo, which was first appeared on [[ESPN5]] logo, which was launched on October 2017, dropping the \"TV\" word on the northeastern quadrant as part of their ''Get It on 5'' campaign. They also started to display the name of the current program using the format: \"(title) ''on 5''\" as the part of the logo (usually applied to entertainment and other programs not provided by either News5 or ESPN5; except blocktimers, where only the 5 logo is displayed) resulting to viewers mistakenly thought \"on\" was part of the title. The numerical five logo was also simultaneously adopted for TV5 sister divisions [[News5]], [[DWFM|Radyo 5]], and [[Digital5|D5 Studio]].\n\nA variation of the current numerical 5 logo was unveiled on 13 January 2019, similar to the newly launched network, [[5 Plus]].\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by 5 (TV channel)}}\n5's program lineup includes news and current affairs programs, dubbed cartoons, movies, American drama, sports, informative, talk shows, infomercials and Japanese anime shows.\n\nOn its second month since its re-launch last 9 August 2008, TV5 has been reportedly on Top 3 based on the [[AGB Nielsen Philippines|AGB Nielsen]] survey. It also gained its rating on their ''Nick on TV5'' morning cartoon block, and its popularity because of their former AniMEGA primetime anime block.\n\nIn 2013, the network's ratings improved as they launched the Weekend Do It Better and Everyday All The Way programming blocks under the helm of the former Chief Entertainment Content Officer, [[Wilma Galvante]] (2012\u20132015), however some of the programs under the block were discontinued, particularly due to low ratings.\n\nIn 2014, the network launched another set of new programs under the \"Happy Ka Dito!\" campaign.\n\nIn 2015, TV5 launched more than a dozen programs that are more focused to light entertainment and sports programming under its \"Happy sa 2015\" campaign. Also the said year, viewers sought the return of AniMEGA.\n\nMonths later, TV5's entertainment programming were produced by different content providers, including Unitel Productions (TV5's sister company), The IdeaFirst Company (formed by former TV5 Entertainment Head Perci Intalan) and Content Cows Company Inc. (formed by Galvante). By 14 October 2015, TV5 Network named [[Sari-Sari Channel|Sari-Sari Network]] as the main production outfit of TV5. They also appointed SSN Co-CEO and [[Viva Entertainment|Viva]] executive, Vicente \"Vic\" Del Rosario as the new Chief Entertainment Strategist of the network. He will handle all of the entertainment programs broadcast by the network. It happened a month after TV5, Cignal and Viva inked a deal to create [[Sari-Sari Channel|Sari-Sari Network]] (SSN). New shows for 2016 were also launched by TV5 together with [[Viva Entertainment]] last 25 November 2015. However, all programs produced by Viva were phased out between July and August 2016 due to management disagreements following an attempted partnership of shows.\n\nJust recently, [[Brillante Mendoza]] signed a contract with TV5 last December 2016 to make made-for-TV movies to be aired on the network under the ''Brillante Mendoza Presents'' umbrella. Unfortunately, the actual date of mini-series ''Brillante Mendoza Presents: Amo'', that supposed to premiere on TV5, was cancelled due to unknown reasons.\n\nSince 2017, [[NFL]] games began to broadcast on TV5, replacing the TV5 Kids presents Cartoon Network block (whereas [[Cartoon Network (Asia)|Cartoon Network]] shows were moved to [[GMA Network]] since [[Ben 10 (2016 TV series)|Ben 10]] on 29 March 2018 and [[CNN Philippines]] on 1 September 2018 in original English-language audio.)<ref>{{cite web|date=7 September 2017|author=ralphierce|title=TV5 Pulls Out Cartoon Network Shows, Refurbish Lineup Anew with NFL, Cockfighting, Japan Japan and Amo|publisher=From the Tube|url=https://fromthetube.wordpress.com/2017/09/07/tv5-pulls-out-cartoon-network-shows-refurbish-lineup-anew-with-nfl-cockfighting-japan-japan-and-amo/}}</ref>\n\nThe network also started airing selected shows from the [[Sari-Sari Channel]] under the ''Sari-Sari sa Weekends'' banner.\n\nAfter several months of hiatus, the local drama ''[[Amo (TV series)|Brillante Mendoza Presents: Amo]]'' was premiered on 21 April 2018.\n\nOn 13 January 2019, all foreign entertainment shows broadcast on 5 started to be broadcast in the original English-language audio instead of Filipino dubbed audio (except ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]'' and Sine Squad on weekends).\n\nIn March 2019, the Sine Squad movie block on weekends are now aired in original English audio (except on weekday afternoons in Filipino dubbed audio starting June 2019).\n\nOn 23 September 2019, upon 5's expansion of its movie blocks, they returned in airing the Filipino language dubbing instead of the original English audio. However, in January of 2020, the primetime movie blocks returned to the original English audio as reruns of 5 programming took the place of the afternoon movies.\n\n==Kapatid Channel==\n{{Main|Kapatid Channel}}\n\nTV5 programs are seen internationally via [[Kapatid Channel]], and is currently available in [[Guam]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://philippines.mom-rsf.org/en/media/tv/ Media Ownership Monitor Philippines - Television] by VERA Files and [[Reporters Without Borders]]\n\n{{Commons category|Associated Broadcasting Company}}\n\n{{TV5|state=expanded}}\n{{Television in the Philippines}}\n\n[[Category:1960 establishments in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:The 5 Network| ]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Mandaluyong]]\n[[Category:Digital terrestrial television in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Filipino-language television stations]]\n[[Category:Media companies of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Philippine television networks]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1960]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 1972]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1992]]\n[[Category:Television in Metro Manila]]\n[[Category:Television in the Philippines]]\n", "name_user": "BeemoZaslavskiMalvar", "label": "safe", "comment": "3Q", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_(TV_channel)"}

Written by Sia and [[Jesse Shatkin]] and produced by Shatkin and [[Greg Kurstin]], the song was released on 17 March 2014 as the [[lead single]] from the album. It is an [[electropop]] song, featuring [[electronica]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[reggae]] influences. Lyrically, the song has a melancholic theme, detailing the demoralisation and rationalisation of [[alcoholism]] through the thought process of a \"party girl\".  More broadly, the song speaks to the fleeting feelings of release and abandon that come with intoxication, as well as the pain, guilt and emptiness that accompany addiction, alcoholism and hedonistic excess.\n\nThe single received critical acclaim and reached the top 5 on [[record chart]]s in 20 countries including France, Italy, Poland, Norway, Australia and New Zealand. In the United States, the single peaked at number 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Sia's first single as a lead artist to appear on the Hot 100, and has sold over 2 million copies in the country. The song received 4 nominations at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]], with its video receiving a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]].<ref name=\"Spin Grammys\"/>\n\nA music video for the song, directed by Sia and [[Daniel Askill]], and choreographed by [[Ryan Heffington]], features dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. It has been viewed on YouTube more than 2.2 billion times. In support of the single and ''1000 Forms of Fear'', Sia, often with Ziegler, performed \"Chandelier\" on a number of American television shows, including ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing With the Stars]]'', and at the 57th Grammy Awards.\n\n==Background==\nIn 2010, [[Sia (musician)|Sia]] released her fifth studio album ''[[We Are Born]]'', which ended up at number two on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Sia&titel=We+Are+Born&cat=a|title=Australian-charts.com &ndash;

Written by Sia and [[Jesse Shatkin]] and produced by Shatkin and [[Greg Kurstin]], the song was released on 17 March 2014 as the [[lead single]] from the album. It is an [[electropop]] song, featuring [[electronica]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[reggae]] influences. Lyrically, the song has a melancholic theme, detailing the demoralisation and rationalisation of [[alcoholism]] through the thought process of a \"party girl\".  More broadly, the song speaks to the fleeting feelings of release and abandon that come with intoxication, as well as the pain, guilt and emptiness that accompany addiction, alcoholism and hedonistic excess.\n\nThe single received critical acclaim and reached the top 5 on [[record chart]]s in 20 countries including France, Italy, Poland, Norway, Australia and New Zealand. In the United States, the single peaked at number 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Sia's first single as a lead artist to appear on the Hot 100, and has sold over 2 million copies in the country. The song received 4 nominations at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]], with its video receiving a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]].<ref name=\"Spin Grammys\"/>\n\nA music video for the song, directed by Sia and [[Daniel Askill]], and choreographed by [[Ryan Heffington]], features dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. It has been viewed on YouTube more than 2.2 billion times. In support of the single and ''1000 Forms of Fear'', Sia, often with Ziegler, performed \"Chandelier\" on a number of American television shows, including ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing With the Stars]]'', and at the 57th Grammy Awards.\n\n==Background==\nIn 2010, [[Sia (musician)|Sia]] released her fifth studio album ''[[We Are Born]]'', which ended up at number two on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Sia&titel=We+Are+Born&cat=a|title=Australian-charts.com &ndash;

Rimes' version was noted for its extreme longevity, spending a record-breaking 69 weeks on the chart and 32 weeks on the top ten alone, also a record. The track spent 25 of those in the top five, yet another record. Despite not peaking at number one, the Rimes version spent five weeks at number two, ten weeks at number three and seven weeks at number four, all non-consecutive. The song spent so many weeks inside the top 5 of the chart that it competed directly with two songs by [[R&B]] singer [[Usher (musician)|Usher]], \"[[You Make Me Wanna...]]\" and \"[[Nice & Slow]]\", that were released seven months apart from each other. Overall, \"How Do I Live\" by Rimes spent 62 weeks in the US Top 40 and 30 weeks on the UK Top 40 singles chart.<ref name=\"bsph\"/>\n\nOn March 11, 2017, \"[[Closer (The Chainsmokers song)|Closer]]\" by [[The Chainsmokers]] and [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]] set the new record for the most amount of time a song has spent in the top five of the Hot 100 when it was ranked at number five, marking its 27th week in the top five (though unlike \"How Do I Live\" this was nonconsecutive). On July 29, 2017 \"[[Shape of You]]\" by [[Ed Sheeran]] also ranked in the top five for a 27th week, thus surpassing \"How Do I Live.\"\n\nTrisha Yearwood's version was moving quickly up the charts, getting as high as number 23, when MCA refused to issue any more copies of the single, for fear of cannibalizing album sales. The limited press run of 300,000 sold out, and the single was off the Hot 100 after 12 weeks.  Yearwood's single on the country charts quickly climbed all the way to number 2.

Rimes' version was noted for its extreme longevity, spending a record-breaking 69 weeks on the chart and 32 weeks on the top ten alone, also a record. The track spent 25 of those in the top five, yet another record. Despite not peaking at number one, the Rimes version spent five weeks at number two, ten weeks at number three and seven weeks at number four, all non-consecutive. The song spent so many weeks inside the top 5 of the chart that it competed directly with two songs by [[R&B]] singer [[Usher (musician)|Usher]], \"[[You Make Me Wanna...]]\" and \"[[Nice & Slow]]\", that were released seven months apart from each other. Overall, \"How Do I Live\" by Rimes spent 62 weeks in the US Top 40 and 30 weeks on the UK Top 40 singles chart.<ref name=\"bsph\"/>\n\nOn March 11, 2017, \"[[Closer (The Chainsmokers song)|Closer]]\" by [[The Chainsmokers]] and [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]] set the new record for the most amount of time a song has spent in the top five of the Hot 100 when it was ranked at number five, marking its 27th week in the top five (though unlike \"How Do I Live\" this was nonconsecutive). On July 29, 2017 \"[[Shape of You]]\" by [[Ed Sheeran]] also ranked in the top five for a 27th week, thus surpassing \"How Do I Live.\"\n\nTrisha Yearwood's version was moving quickly up the charts, getting as high as number 23, when MCA refused to issue any more copies of the single, for fear of cannibalizing album sales. The limited press run of 300,000 sold out, and the single was off the Hot 100 after 12 weeks.  Yearwood's single on the country charts quickly climbed all the way to number 2. Rimes single was the top selling country single of all time.\n\nRimes' version ranked at number 4 on Billboard's All Time Top 100 in 2008. When the All Time chart was retabulated for the chart's 55th anniversary in 2013, it remained in the same position, being the most successful single by a female artist in the list. [[Billboard Magazine]] also ranked the song as the most successful single of the 1990s.<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/>\n\nRimes' version spent 11 weeks atop the Adult Contemporary chart.<ref name=top100/>\nIn Australia, Rimes' version peaked on the [[ARIA Charts]] at number 17 while Yearwood's peaked at number 3.\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n===Rimes version charts and sales===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Weekly charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1997\u201399)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|17|artist=LeAnn Rimes|song=How Do I Live|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|24|artist=LeAnn Rimes|song=How Do I Live|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|19|chartid=3369|publishdate=October 27, 1997|accessdate=July 17, 2013|artist=|song=|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|13|chartid=3322|publishdate=September 15, 1997|accessdate=July 17, 2013|artist=|song=|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadacountry|60|chartid=3313|publishdate=September 1, 1997|accessdate=July 17, 2013|artist=|song=|refname=}}\n|-\n|Denmark ([[IFPI Denmark|IFPI]])<ref>Danish Singles Chart 25 September 1998</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|16\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany<!--European Charts-->|22|artist=Rimes, LeAnn|song=How Do I Live|refname=}}\n|-\n|Ireland ([[Irish Recorded Music Association|IRMA]])<ref name=irishcharts>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement |title=The Irish Charts \u2013 All there is to know |work=irishcharts.ie |accessdate=September 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hFf8iFDu?url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement |archivedate=June 3, 2009}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch40|4|artist=LeAnn Rimes|song=How Do I Live|accessdate=June 19, 2018|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch100|5|artist=LeAnn Rimes|song=How Do I Live|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Norway|4|artist=LeAnn Rimes|song=How Do I Live|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Scotland|6|artist=LeAnn Rimes|song=How Do I Live|date=1998-04-19|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Switzerland|24|artist=LeAnn Rimes|song=How Do I Live|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|UKsinglesbyname|7|artist=LeAnn Rimes|song=How Do I Live|artistid=1892}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|2|artist=LeAnn Rimes|artistid=155119|accessdate=2011-10-07|song=|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultcontemporary|1|artist=LeAnn Rimes|artistid=155119|accessdate=2011-10-07|song=|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultpopsongs|10|artist=LeAnn Rimes|artistid=155119|accessdate=2011-10-07|song=|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardcountrysongs|43|artist=LeAnn Rimes|artistid=155119|accessdate=2011-10-07|song=|refname=}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardpopsongs|4|artist=LeAnn Rimes|artistid=155119|accessdate=2011-10-07|song=|refname=}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Year-end charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Country\n!Position\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1997\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"|1998\n|Europe<ref>[http://jove.prohosting.com/euro100/archive/1998/1998-ye.txt]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|72\n|-\n|Netherlands<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.top40.nl/pdf/Top%20100/top%20100%20-%201998.pdf |title=Singles Top 100 Van 1998 |publisher=Top40.nl |date= |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n|-\n|United Kingdom\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1999\n|align=\"left\"|Germany (Official German Charts)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/charts/single-jahr/for-date-1999 |title=Top 100 Single-Jahrescharts|language=German |publisher=[[GfK Entertainment]] |accessdate=April 21, 2018}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|84\n|}\n\n====Decade-end charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
