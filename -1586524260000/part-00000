He was still a kid when he started drawing on the pavement of the village's streets. The son of a railwayman, Benito entered [[Macerata]]'s art school at age 11, graduating to [[Florence|Firenze]]'s art institute five years later. Here he received the nickname ''lisca di pesce'' (\"fishbone\") because of his thin figure, that he will use as his signature during his career.\n\nIn 1939 Jacovitti started working for the Florentine satirical magazine ''Il Brivido'' and, a year later, he began an almost 30 years long collaboration with ''[[Il Vittorioso]]'', a Catholic comic magazine targeted at teenagers and young adults that only published Italian artists. There he created several characters: Pippo, Pertica e Palla, Oreste il guastafeste, Chicchiricch\u00ec, [[Cip l'arcipoliziotto]] and his nemesis Zagar, Giacinto corsaro dipinto, Jack Mandolino, La signora Carlomagno, adaptations of classic like ''[[Ali Baba]]'' and ''[[Don Quixote]],'' and parodies of famous comics like ''L'onorevole [[Tarzan]]'' and ''Il mago [[Mandrake the Magician|Mandrago]]''. During this period, he also contributed cartoons to the satirical weekly ''[[Il Travaso delle idee]]''.\n\nStarting from 1949, Jacovitti produced a series of cartoons for school diaries, named ''I Diari Vitt'' (short for ''Vittorioso'') and published by A.V.E. These books made him a household name among kids and parents, and he kept producing them until 1980.\n\nIn 1956 he began working for the newspaper ''[[Il Giorno (newspaper)|Il Giorno]]'', then owned by [[Enrico Mattei]], where he created his best known character, the cowboy [[Cocco Bill]], as well as the private eye Tom Ficcanaso.\n\nTen years later Jacovitti left ''Il Giorno'' to join the glorious ''[[Il Corriere dei Piccoli]]'', then the most popular weekly publication for kids, for which he renewed old characters as Cip l'Arcipoliziotto and Zagar, and created new ones as [[Zorry Kid]], Tarallino Tarall\u00e0 and others.\n\nIn 1973 he published the controversial ''Gionni Peppe'' on the left-wing oriented magazine ''[[Linus (magazine)|Linus]]'', followed in 1981 by ''Joe Balordo''.\n\nJacovitti's unique artstyle is immediately appealing to both kids and adults: his characters sport huge noses and feet, his pages are chock full of details and all sort of objects and weird creatures born from his untamed creativity (like his salami, often drawn with little legs or smiley faces). While most of his production was geared toward humour and parody, Jacovitti did not shy away from more controversial material like the erotic book ''Kamasultra'' (based on the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'') and political cartoons.\n\nDuring his career, Jacovitti created more than 60 characters and produced around 150 books, making him one of the most prolific and original artists in comic book history.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.jacovitti.it}}\n* [https://coccobill.muuta.net/ Cocco Bill and other characters bibliography]\n* [http://www.lambiek.net/artists/j/jacovitti.htm article from Lambiek Comiclopedia]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jacovitti, Benito}}\n[[Category:1923 births]]\n[[Category:1997 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from the Province of Campobasso]]\n[[Category:Italian comics artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=March 2012}}\n{{Infobox comics creator\n| name          = Benito Jacovitti\n| image         = Jacovitti-photo-by-joe-zatt.jpg\n| image_size    = 150\n| caption       = \n| alt           = \n| birth_name    = \n| birth_date    = March 19, 1923\n| birth_place   = [[Termoli]], [[Molise]], [[Italy]]\n| death_date    = December 3, 1997\n| death_place   = \n| nationality   = Italian\n| area          = \n| cartoonist    = y\n| write         = \n| art           = \n| pencil        = \n| ink           = \n| edit          = \n| publish       = \n| letter        = \n| color         = \n| alias         = \n| signature     = <!-- very optional -->\n| signature_alt = \n| notable works = [[Cocco Bill]]\n| collaborators = \n| influences    = \n| influenced    = \n| awards        = \n| website       = http://www.jacovitti.it\n| nonUS         = yes\n| sortkey       = Jacovitti, Benito\n| subcat        = \n}}\n\n'''Benito Jacovitti''' (March 19, 1923 \u2013 December 3, 1997) was an Italian comic artist.<ref name=\"asb\">{{cite web |title=BENITO JACOVITTI \u2013 ILLUSTRATOR, CARTOONIST |url=https://www.archiviostoricobarilla.com/en/explore/focus/biographic-references-of-authors/benito-jacovitti-illustrator-cartoonist/ |website=archiviostoricobarilla.com/ |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nBenito Jacovitti was born in [[Termoli]], [[Molise]].

Morral sought refuge from republican journalist [[Jos\u00e9 Nakens]] but fled in the night to [[Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz]], whose villagers reported the interloper. Two days after the attack, militiamen accosted Morral, who killed one before killing himself.

Its capital is [[Pili, Camarines Sur|Pili]] and the province borders [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Quezon]] to the northwest, and [[Albay]] to the south. To the east lies the island province of [[Catanduanes]] across the [[Maqueda Channel]].\n\nCamarines Sur is the largest among the six provinces in the Bicol Region both by population and land area. Its territory includes two cities: [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]], the lone chartered city, as the province's religious, cultural, financial, commercial, industrial and business center; and [[Iriga]], a component city, as the center of the Rinconada area and [[Rinconada Bikol|Ri\u014bkon\u0101da]] Language. Within the province lies [[Lake Buhi]], where the smallest commercially harvested fish, the [[Sinarapan]] (''Mistichthys luzonensis''), can be found. The province is also home to the critically endangered Isarog Agta language, one of the three critically endangered languages in the Philippines according to [[UNESCO]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-colonial and Spanish colonial era===\n\nThe earliest settlers in Camarines Sur are the Isarog Agta people who live within the circumference of [[Mount Isarog]] and the Iraya Agta who live within the circumference of Mount Iraya. They have been in the province for thousands of years and have been one of the first settlers in the entire Philippines.\n\nIn July 1569, [[Luis Enriquez de Guzman]], a member of the expedition led by Maestro de Campo [[Mateo de Saz]] and Captain [[Martin de Goiti]], led a group which crossed from [[Burias (island)|Burias]] and [[Ticao Island|Ticao]] islands and landed on a coastal settlement called ''Ibalon'' in what is now the province of [[Sorsogon]]. From this point another expedition was sent to explore the interior and founded the town of ''Camalig''.\n\nIn 1573, Spanish ''conquistador'' [[Juan de Salcedo]] penetrated the [[Bicol Peninsula]] from the north as made it as far south as Libon, establishing the settlement of [[Santiago de Libon]]. [[Jose Maria Pe\u00f1aranda]], the first governor of [[Albay]] and a military engineer, was made ''coregidor'' of the province on May 14, 1834. He constructed public buildings and built roads and bridges.\n\nThe entire [[Bicol Peninsula]] was organized as one province with two divisions, Camarines in the northwest and Ibalon in the southeast. In 1636, the two ''partido''s were separated.\n\nKnown centuries ago as the ''Tierra de Camarines'', the province is distinctly Spanish-founded settlement. Its name having been derived from ''camaronchones'' or ''camarines'', a Spanish word for ''kamalig'' referring to small nipa or bamboo-made [[nipa hut|huts]] by the natives.\n\nIn 1574, [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Guido de Lavezaris]] referred Camarines Sur to the [[King of Spain]] as ''Los Camarines'', after the abundance of ''camarin''s-rice granaries - which were conspicuous features of the area.\n\nSpanish colonizers later subjugated its people and denominated the area into two distinct aggrupations. The southern portion comprising the area south of the present town of [[Camalig, Albay|Camalig]] (in Albay), Sorsogon, the islands of [[Masbate Island|Masbate]] and [[Catanduanes]], and the area, which is now [[Partido (Philippines)|Partido]] in present day, then called ''Partido de Ibalon''. The northern, upper portion, which included from the present day Camalig town in Albay, and all towns of Camarines Sur and [[Camarines Norte]], was called ''Partido de Camarines''.\n\n''Partido de Camarines'' was partitioned into ''Camarines Sur'' and ''Camarines Norte'' in 1829, and thereafter underwent fusion, annexations and re-partitions until March 19, 1919 when two provinces, jointly called ''[[Ambos Camarines]]'', were finally separated with their present boundaries by decree of the [[First Philippine Legislature]].\n\nThe [[Philippine Revolution]] started in Ambos Camarines when [[Elias Angeles]] and [[Felix Plazo]], Filipino corporals in the Spanish Army, sided with revolutionists and fought the local Spanish forces on September 17, 1898. Governor [[Vicente Zaidin]] capitulated to the revolutionists on the following day. With the arrival of General [[Vicente Lukban]], the revolutionary government in the Bicol Region was established.\n\n===American colonial era and World War II===\nThe American forces occupied the Bicol Peninsula in January 1900. In March of the same year. General [[John M. Bell]] was made the military governor of the southeastern Luzon. Civil government was finally established in Ambos Camarines in April 1901.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Camarines Sur came under [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]] in late December 1941, following the capture of Naga City on December 18, a few days after the [[Japanese invasion of Legaspi]].<ref name=\"Hyper\">{{cite web|title=The First Landings|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-PI/USA-P-PI-6.html|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> Guerrilla units were organized by [[Wenceslao Q. Vinzons]] that waged underground operations against the Japanese troops stationed in Camarines Sur. After the capture of Vinzons on July 8, 1942, the guerrilla movement was carried on by Lieutenant [[Francisco Boayes]] and by the [[Tangcong Vaca Guerrilla Unit]] organized by Elias Madrid, Juan Miranda and Leon Aureus. In April 1945, Camarines Sur was finally liberated from the Japanese invaders against the combined Filipino and American troops in 1945.\n\nOn March 8, 1942, the famous Tangcong Vaca Guerrilla Unit (TVGU) was organized in San Nicolas, [[Canaman]] with Juan Miranda as the Commanding Officer, Leon Aureus as the Executive Officer and Elias Madrid as the Finance Officer. Among the numerous Canamanons who joined-up soon afterwards either in the unit\u2019s intelligence or combat components were Jose and Antonio Madrid, Mamerto Sibulo, Andres Fortaleza, Marcos Severo, Damaso Avenilla, Federico Crescini, Nicolas Vargas, Venancio Begino, Eugenio Ragodon, Juan Pachica, Santiago Amaro, Jose Gervas, Pedro Angeles, Aproniano Lopez, Andres Alzate, Modesto Sanchez, Blas Alcantara, Andres Aguilar, Florencio Frondozo, Alfredo de la Torre and Flaviano Estrada.\n\nThe military general headquarters and military camp bases of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] were active on January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] was active on October 28, 1944 to June 30, 1946 in the province of Camarines Sur. The Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary were spearheading the local military special operations in Bicol Region with the Bicolano guerrilla units decisively aiding them.\n\nIn 1945, Filipino and American troops along with the Bicolano guerrillas, liberated Camarines Sur from the Japanese forces towards the end of WWII. Local Filipino troops of the 4th, 5th, 52nd, 53rd, 55th, 56th and 57th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 5th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary were involved in the liberation efforts.\n\n===Transfer of provincial capital===\nNaga, the former capital of Camarines Sur, was founded in 1573 as [[Nueva C\u00e1ceres]], named after the [[C\u00e1ceres, Spain|city]] in Spain. It was among the original five royal cities of the colony. It was designated as the provincial capital by virtue of ''Philippine Legislative Act No. 2711'' approved on March 10, 1917. In June 6, 1955 however, [[Pili, Camarines Sur|Pili]], the adjoining town, was declared the provincial capital by virtue of ''[[Republic Act]] 1336''. Pili functions as the provincial capital up to the present.<ref>{{cite web|title=Camarines Sur|url=http://www.visitmyphilippines.com/index.php?title=CamarinesSur&func=all&pid=445|accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCamarines Sur covers a total area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2|0}}{{PSGC detail|nscb}} occupying the central section of the [[Bicol Region]] in [[Luzon]]. The province borders [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Quezon]] to the northwest, and [[Albay]] to the south.

The census also stated that Camarines Sur had 288,172 households with an average household size of 5.37 persons, significantly higher than the national average of 4.99. The annual growth rate was 1.86%, much lower than the national growth rate of 2.36%. This rate of growth will double the population of Camarines Sur in 8 years.\n\n===Religion===\nThe religion of the province is predominantly [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholicism]] followed by 93%{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} of the population. Other religions professed by the people include the [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]] or Aglipayan Church, Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC), Baptist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Jehovah's Witnesses, Methodists and other smaller Christian groups. Islam is also present in the province with their mosques stood in large population areas.\n\nPrior to colonization, the region had a complex religious system which involved various deities. Among these deities include: Gugurang, the supreme god who dwells inside of [[Mount Mayon]] where he guards and protects the sacred fire in which Aswang, his brother was trying to steal. Whenever people disobey his orders, wishes and commit numerous sins, he would cause Mount Mayon to burst lava as a sign of warning for people to mend their crooked ways. Ancient Bikolanos had a rite performed for him called Atang.;<ref name=\"ourownvoice.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ourownvoice.com/tales/tales2004a-2.shtml |title=Asuang Steals Fire from Gugurang by Damiana L.

He has deep affection towards Magindang, but plays with him by running away so that Magindang would never catch him. The reason for this is because he is shy to the man that he loves. If Magindang manages to catch Bulan, Haliya always comes to free him from Magindang's grip; ''Magindang'', the god of the sea and all its creatures. He has deep affection to the lunar god Bulan and pursues him despite never catching him. Due to this, the Bicolanos reasoned that it is to why the waves rise to reach the moon when seen from the distant horizon. Whenever he does catch up to Bulan, Haliya comes to rescue Bulan and free him immediately; ''Okot'', god of forest and hunting; and ''[[Bakunawa]]'',  a gigantic sea serpent deity who is often considered as the cause of eclipses, the devourer of the sun and the moon, and an adversary of Haliya as Bakunawa's main aim is to swallow Bulan, who Haliya swore to protect for all of eternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/181693/eclipse-bakunawa-eats-the-sun-behind-a-curtain-of-clouds|title=GMANews: Eclipse; Bakunawa eats the sun behind a curtain of clouds|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Languages===\nThe main languages spoken in Camarines Sur are the [[Coastal Bikol languages|Coastal Bikol]] (especially [[Central Bikol]]) and [[Inland Bikol languages|Inland Bikol]] group of languages. The latter is a group of languages that includes [[Albay Bikol language|Albay Bikol]] group and [[Rinconada Bikol language|Rinconada Bikol]], while the former just consists dialects. A dialect of Coastal Bikol, called ''Coastal Bikol-Partido'' is used in the eastern portion of the province around [[Lagonoy Gulf]], and another dialect called ''Coastal Bikol-Central'' is spoken around [[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga City]].\n\nThe [[Rinconada Bikol language|Rinconada Bikol]] also known as Ri\u014bkon\u0101da (under the umbrella of Inland Bikol group of languages), is used by most people in the Rinconada area or district of the province especially in [[Nabua, Camarines Sur|Nabua]], [[Iriga City]] and by people of Rinconada in diaspora. ''[[Albay Bikol language|Buhinon]]'' (one of the languages of Albay Bikol group, another member of Inland Bikol), is a minority language spoken in the town of Buhi and around [[Lake Buhi]]. Most inhabitants of Camarines Sur understand [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[English language|English]].\n\nThe Canaman dialect of [[Central Bikol]] variant of ''Coastal Bikol'' spoken in [[Canaman, Camarines Sur]] is said to be the \"purest\" form of Bikol (according to Jesuit anthropologist Frank Lynch, S.J.), though most linguists just consider it as the standard form of Central Bikol language since other Coastal Bikol languages, Rinconada Bikol and Buhinon (both Inland Bikol) are separate languages.\n\n==Isarog Agta Language==\nIn 2010, [[UNESCO]] released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages in the ''Isarog Agta'' language which has an estimated 5 speakers in the year 2000. The language was classified as ''Critically Endangered'', meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 150 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of [[Isarog]] Agta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades.\n\nThe Isarog Agta people live within the circumference of Mount Isarog, though only 5 of them still know their indigenous language. They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines. They belong to the [[Aeta people]] classification, but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nThe economy of Camarines Sur is mostly agriculture-based. 29 of the 35 towns are agricultural and produce rice, corn, feedmeal, freshwater fish, livestock, coconut, sugar, abac\u00e1, and water-lily.\n\nEntrepreneurs engage in trading, often branching out towards neighboring provinces in the south as local demand might be limited by the 3rd to 5th income-class municipalities. Handicrafts are the major source of rural income, providing a fairly large share in the small-scale industries of the province. Forestry and papermaking are other sources of livelihood. The manufacture of abac\u00e1 products such as Manila hemp, hats, bags, mats, and slippers is one of the main sources of income in the rural areas. Fishing is also done along both shores of the province. Tourism, primarily because of Caramoan and [[Mount Isarog]], also generates income for Camarines Sur.\n\n[[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]] and several towns have a tri-economy or three-base economy: commerce, industry, and agriculture.  As the main center in the Bicol Region, all of the products from other provinces in the region are brought to Naga. It has four major industries: the manufacture of jewelry and gifts/toys/housewares, and processing of pineapple and coconut. Naga also has vast cornfields, rice fields, and water lily farms all over the city.\n\n[[Calabanga, Camarines Sur|Calabanga]], [[Cabusao, Camarines Sur|Cabusao]], [[Libmanan, Camarines Sur|Libmanan]] and [[Sipocot, Camarines Sur|Sipocot]] have similar economies to Naga City. Calabanga has commerce from goods moving out of Naga, and is the trade center for the towns of [[Tinambac, Camarines Sur|Tinambac]], [[Goa, Camarines Sur|Goa]], and [[Siruma, Camarines Sur|Siruma]]. Calabanga also has fishing from the Quipayo Fishing Center (the largest in Bicol), and vast productions of corn, sugar, and rice, which benefit from a large granary. Libmanan has 156 hectares of ricefields and cornfields, and fishing along its coastline connecting the towns of [[Ragay, Camarines Sur|Ragay]] and [[Pasacao, Camarines Sur|Pasacao]]; Libmanan also has a commercial district. Sipocot has an agricultural base economy, with an abundant stock of native chicken (Sipocot's OTOP) and wide production of calamansi and other vegetables, while also serving as trading post for towns of Cabusao, Ragay and Mercedes (Camarines Norte).

Its capital is [[Pili, Camarines Sur|Pili]] and the province borders [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Quezon]] to the northwest, and [[Albay]] to the south. To the east lies the island province of [[Catanduanes]] across the [[Maqueda Channel]].\n\nCamarines Sur is the largest among the six provinces in the Bicol Region both by population and land area. Its territory includes two cities: [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]], the lone chartered city, as the province's religious, cultural, financial, commercial, industrial and business center; and [[Iriga]], a component city, as the center of the Rinconada area and [[Rinconada Bikol|Ri\u014bkon\u0101da]] Language. Within the province lies [[Lake Buhi]], where the smallest commercially harvested fish, the [[Sinarapan]] (''Mistichthys luzonensis''), can be found. The province is also home to the critically endangered Isarog Agta language, one of the three critically endangered languages in the Philippines according to [[UNESCO]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-colonial and Spanish colonial era===\n\nThe earliest settlers in Camarines Sur are the Isarog Agta people who live within the circumference of [[Mount Isarog]] and the Iraya Agta who live within the circumference of Mount Iraya. They have been in the province for thousands of years and have been one of the first settlers in the entire Philippines.\n\nIn July 1569, [[Luis Enriquez de Guzman]], a member of the expedition led by Maestro de Campo [[Mateo de Saz]] and Captain [[Martin de Goiti]], led a group which crossed from [[Burias (island)|Burias]] and [[Ticao Island|Ticao]] islands and landed on a coastal settlement called ''Ibalon'' in what is now the province of [[Sorsogon]]. From this point another expedition was sent to explore the interior and founded the town of ''Camalig''.\n\nIn 1573, Spanish ''conquistador'' [[Juan de Salcedo]] penetrated the [[Bicol Peninsula]] from the north as made it as far south as Libon, establishing the settlement of [[Santiago de Libon]]. [[Jose Maria Pe\u00f1aranda]], the first governor of [[Albay]] and a military engineer, was made ''coregidor'' of the province on May 14, 1834. He constructed public buildings and built roads and bridges.\n\nThe entire [[Bicol Peninsula]] was organized as one province with two divisions, Camarines in the northwest and Ibalon in the southeast. In 1636, the two ''partido''s were separated.\n\nKnown centuries ago as the ''Tierra de Camarines'', the province is distinctly Spanish-founded settlement. Its name having been derived from ''camaronchones'' or ''camarines'', a Spanish word for ''kamalig'' referring to small nipa or bamboo-made [[nipa hut|huts]] by the natives.\n\nIn 1574, [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Guido de Lavezaris]] referred Camarines Sur to the [[King of Spain]] as ''Los Camarines'', after the abundance of ''camarin''s-rice granaries - which were conspicuous features of the area.\n\nSpanish colonizers later subjugated its people and denominated the area into two distinct aggrupations. The southern portion comprising the area south of the present town of [[Camalig, Albay|Camalig]] (in Albay), Sorsogon, the islands of [[Masbate Island|Masbate]] and [[Catanduanes]], and the area, which is now [[Partido (Philippines)|Partido]] in present day, then called ''Partido de Ibalon''. The northern, upper portion, which included from the present day Camalig town in Albay, and all towns of Camarines Sur and [[Camarines Norte]], was called ''Partido de Camarines''.\n\n''Partido de Camarines'' was partitioned into ''Camarines Sur'' and ''Camarines Norte'' in 1829, and thereafter underwent fusion, annexations and re-partitions until March 19, 1919 when two provinces, jointly called ''[[Ambos Camarines]]'', were finally separated with their present boundaries by decree of the [[First Philippine Legislature]].\n\nThe [[Philippine Revolution]] started in Ambos Camarines when [[Elias Angeles]] and [[Felix Plazo]], Filipino corporals in the Spanish Army, sided with revolutionists and fought the local Spanish forces on September 17, 1898. Governor [[Vicente Zaidin]] capitulated to the revolutionists on the following day. With the arrival of General [[Vicente Lukban]], the revolutionary government in the Bicol Region was established.\n\n===American colonial era and World War II===\nThe American forces occupied the Bicol Peninsula in January 1900. In March of the same year. General [[John M. Bell]] was made the military governor of the southeastern Luzon. Civil government was finally established in Ambos Camarines in April 1901.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Camarines Sur came under [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]] in late December 1941, following the capture of Naga City on December 18, a few days after the [[Japanese invasion of Legaspi]].<ref name=\"Hyper\">{{cite web|title=The First Landings|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-PI/USA-P-PI-6.html|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> Guerrilla units were organized by [[Wenceslao Q. Vinzons]] that waged underground operations against the Japanese troops stationed in Camarines Sur. After the capture of Vinzons on July 8, 1942, the guerrilla movement was carried on by Lieutenant [[Francisco Boayes]] and by the [[Tangcong Vaca Guerrilla Unit]] organized by Elias Madrid, Juan Miranda and Leon Aureus. In April 1945, Camarines Sur was finally liberated from the Japanese invaders against the combined Filipino and American troops in 1945.\n\nOn March 8, 1942, the famous Tangcong Vaca Guerrilla Unit (TVGU) was organized in San Nicolas, [[Canaman]] with Juan Miranda as the Commanding Officer, Leon Aureus as the Executive Officer and Elias Madrid as the Finance Officer. Among the numerous Canamanons who joined-up soon afterwards either in the unit\u2019s intelligence or combat components were Jose and Antonio Madrid, Mamerto Sibulo, Andres Fortaleza, Marcos Severo, Damaso Avenilla, Federico Crescini, Nicolas Vargas, Venancio Begino, Eugenio Ragodon, Juan Pachica, Santiago Amaro, Jose Gervas, Pedro Angeles, Aproniano Lopez, Andres Alzate, Modesto Sanchez, Blas Alcantara, Andres Aguilar, Florencio Frondozo, Alfredo de la Torre and Flaviano Estrada.\n\nThe military general headquarters and military camp bases of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] were active on January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] was active on October 28, 1944 to June 30, 1946 in the province of Camarines Sur. The Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary were spearheading the local military special operations in Bicol Region with the Bicolano guerrilla units decisively aiding them.\n\nIn 1945, Filipino and American troops along with the Bicolano guerrillas, liberated Camarines Sur from the Japanese forces towards the end of WWII. Local Filipino troops of the 4th, 5th, 52nd, 53rd, 55th, 56th and 57th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 5th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary were involved in the liberation efforts.\n\n===Transfer of provincial capital===\nNaga, the former capital of Camarines Sur, was founded in 1573 as [[Nueva C\u00e1ceres]], named after the [[C\u00e1ceres|city]] in Spain. It was among the original five royal cities of the colony. It was designated as the provincial capital by virtue of ''Philippine Legislative Act No. 2711'' approved on March 10, 1917. In June 6, 1955 however, [[Pili, Camarines Sur|Pili]], the adjoining town, was declared the provincial capital by virtue of ''[[Republic Act]] 1336''. Pili functions as the provincial capital up to the present.<ref>{{cite web|title=Camarines Sur|url=http://www.visitmyphilippines.com/index.php?title=CamarinesSur&func=all&pid=445|accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCamarines Sur covers a total area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2|0}}{{PSGC detail|nscb}} occupying the central section of the [[Bicol Region]] in [[Luzon]]. The province borders [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Quezon]] to the northwest, and [[Albay]] to the south.

The census also stated that Camarines Sur had 288,172 households with an average household size of 5.37 persons, significantly higher than the national average of 4.99. The annual growth rate was 1.86%, much lower than the national growth rate of 2.36%. This rate of growth will double the population of Camarines Sur in 8 years.\n\n===Religion===\nThe religion of the province is predominantly [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholicism]] followed by 93%{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} of the population. Other religions professed by the people include the [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]] or Aglipayan Church, Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC), Baptist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Jehovah's Witnesses, Methodists and other smaller Christian groups. Islam is also present in the province with their mosques stood in large population areas.\n\nPrior to colonization, the region had a complex religious system which involved various deities. Among these deities include: Gugurang, the supreme god who dwells inside of [[Mount Mayon]] where he guards and protects the sacred fire in which Aswang, his brother was trying to steal. Whenever people disobey his orders, wishes and commit numerous sins, he would cause Mount Mayon to burst lava as a sign of warning for people to mend their crooked ways. Ancient Bikolanos had a rite performed for him called Atang.;<ref name=\"ourownvoice.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ourownvoice.com/tales/tales2004a-2.shtml |title=Asuang Steals Fire from Gugurang by Damiana L.

He has deep affection towards Magindang, but plays with him by running away so that Magindang would never catch him. The reason for this is because he is shy to the man that he loves. If Magindang manages to catch Bulan, Haliya always comes to free him from Magindang's grip; ''Magindang'', the god of the sea and all its creatures. He has deep affection to the lunar god Bulan and pursues him despite never catching him. Due to this, the Bicolanos reasoned that it is to why the waves rise to reach the moon when seen from the distant horizon. Whenever he does catch up to Bulan, Haliya comes to rescue Bulan and free him immediately; ''Okot'', god of forest and hunting; and ''[[Bakunawa]]'',  a gigantic sea serpent deity who is often considered as the cause of eclipses, the devourer of the sun and the moon, and an adversary of Haliya as Bakunawa's main aim is to swallow Bulan, who Haliya swore to protect for all of eternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/181693/eclipse-bakunawa-eats-the-sun-behind-a-curtain-of-clouds|title=GMANews: Eclipse; Bakunawa eats the sun behind a curtain of clouds|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Languages===\nThe main languages spoken in Camarines Sur are the [[Coastal Bikol languages|Coastal Bikol]] (especially [[Central Bikol]]) and [[Inland Bikol languages|Inland Bikol]] group of languages. The latter is a group of languages that includes [[Albay Bikol language|Albay Bikol]] group and [[Rinconada Bikol language|Rinconada Bikol]], while the former just consists dialects. A dialect of Coastal Bikol, called ''Coastal Bikol-Partido'' is used in the eastern portion of the province around [[Lagonoy Gulf]], and another dialect called ''Coastal Bikol-Central'' is spoken around [[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga City]].\n\nThe [[Rinconada Bikol language|Rinconada Bikol]] also known as Ri\u014bkon\u0101da (under the umbrella of Inland Bikol group of languages), is used by most people in the Rinconada area or district of the province especially in [[Nabua, Camarines Sur|Nabua]], [[Iriga City]] and by people of Rinconada in diaspora. ''[[Albay Bikol language|Buhinon]]'' (one of the languages of Albay Bikol group, another member of Inland Bikol), is a minority language spoken in the town of Buhi and around [[Lake Buhi]]. Most inhabitants of Camarines Sur understand [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[English language|English]].\n\nThe Canaman dialect of [[Central Bikol]] variant of ''Coastal Bikol'' spoken in [[Canaman, Camarines Sur]] is said to be the \"purest\" form of Bikol (according to Jesuit anthropologist Frank Lynch, S.J.), though most linguists just consider it as the standard form of Central Bikol language since other Coastal Bikol languages, Rinconada Bikol and Buhinon (both Inland Bikol) are separate languages.\n\n==Isarog Agta Language==\nIn 2010, [[UNESCO]] released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages in the ''Isarog Agta'' language which has an estimated 5 speakers in the year 2000. The language was classified as ''Critically Endangered'', meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 150 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of [[Isarog]] Agta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades.\n\nThe Isarog Agta people live within the circumference of Mount Isarog, though only 5 of them still know their indigenous language. They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines. They belong to the [[Aeta people]] classification, but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nThe economy of Camarines Sur is mostly agriculture-based. 29 of the 35 towns are agricultural and produce rice, corn, feedmeal, freshwater fish, livestock, coconut, sugar, abac\u00e1, and water-lily.\n\nEntrepreneurs engage in trading, often branching out towards neighboring provinces in the south as local demand might be limited by the 3rd to 5th income-class municipalities. Handicrafts are the major source of rural income, providing a fairly large share in the small-scale industries of the province. Forestry and papermaking are other sources of livelihood. The manufacture of abac\u00e1 products such as Manila hemp, hats, bags, mats, and slippers is one of the main sources of income in the rural areas. Fishing is also done along both shores of the province. Tourism, primarily because of Caramoan and [[Mount Isarog]], also generates income for Camarines Sur.\n\n[[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]] and several towns have a tri-economy or three-base economy: commerce, industry, and agriculture.  As the main center in the Bicol Region, all of the products from other provinces in the region are brought to Naga. It has four major industries: the manufacture of jewelry and gifts/toys/housewares, and processing of pineapple and coconut. Naga also has vast cornfields, rice fields, and water lily farms all over the city.\n\n[[Calabanga, Camarines Sur|Calabanga]], [[Cabusao, Camarines Sur|Cabusao]], [[Libmanan, Camarines Sur|Libmanan]] and [[Sipocot, Camarines Sur|Sipocot]] have similar economies to Naga City. Calabanga has commerce from goods moving out of Naga, and is the trade center for the towns of [[Tinambac, Camarines Sur|Tinambac]], [[Goa, Camarines Sur|Goa]], and [[Siruma, Camarines Sur|Siruma]]. Calabanga also has fishing from the Quipayo Fishing Center (the largest in Bicol), and vast productions of corn, sugar, and rice, which benefit from a large granary. Libmanan has 156 hectares of ricefields and cornfields, and fishing along its coastline connecting the towns of [[Ragay, Camarines Sur|Ragay]] and [[Pasacao, Camarines Sur|Pasacao]]; Libmanan also has a commercial district. Sipocot has an agricultural base economy, with an abundant stock of native chicken (Sipocot's OTOP) and wide production of calamansi and other vegetables, while also serving as trading post for towns of Cabusao, Ragay and Mercedes (Camarines Norte). Fish products from these towns are received by Sipocot. Other towns not mentioned have a fishing industry as the main base of their economy.\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n* 19th-century churches \u2013 There are a number of century old-churches in [[Goa, Camarines Sur|Goa]], [[San Jose, Nueva Ecija|San Jose]] and [[Sag\u00f1ay]].\n* [[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia Shrine|Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia Church]] \u2013 Completed in 1750, this two-century-old church is a site of pilgrimage located in Naga.\n* [[Lake Buhi]] - Created by volcanic activity, this isolated lake is famous for unique organisms including the world's smallest commercially harvested fish.\n* [[Mount Isarog]] and [[Mount Asog]] \u2013 Two potentially active volcanoes with hiking trails to explore rich biodiversity.\n* Beaches of Sag\u00f1ay, Sabang (Partido) and [[Caramoan, Camarines Sur|Caramoan]] \u2013 These black and white sand beaches are shielded by coral reefs.\n* Pasacao \u2013 Known for its beaches as \"the Summer Capital of Cam.

The coronet was revised in 1996 following local government reorganisation (and is almost identical to the pre-1975 version). The present version is based on the coat of arms granted by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] in 1673.]] -->\n[[Dundee]] ({{lang-gd|D\u00f9n D\u00e8agh}}) is the fourth-largest [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] in [[Scotland]] with a population of around 150,000 people. It is situated on the north bank of the [[Firth of Tay]] on the east coast of the [[Central Lowlands]] of Scotland. The Dundee area has been settled since the [[Mesolithic]] with evidence of [[Picts|Pictish]] habitation beginning in the [[Iron Age]]. During the [[Medieval Era]] the city became a prominent trading port and was the site of many battles. Throughout the [[Industrial Revolution]], the local [[jute]] industry caused the city to grow rapidly. In this period, Dundee also gained prominence due to its marmalade industry and its journalism, giving Dundee its epithet as the city of \"jute, jam and journalism\".\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe name \"Dundee\" is of uncertain etymology. It incorporates the place-name element ''d\u00f9n'', fort, present in both [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] and in [[Brythonic languages]] such as [[Pictish]].<ref>Taylor (1898); Forsyth (1997)</ref> The remainder of the name is less obvious. One possibility is that it comes from the Gaelic 'D\u00e8agh', meaning 'fire'. Another is that it derives from 'Tay', and it is in this form, 'Duntay' that the town is seen in [[Timothy Pont]]'s map (c.1583\u20131596).<ref>Pont (c1583-96) p325</ref> Another suggestion is that it is a personal name, referring to an otherwise unknown local ruler named 'Daigh'.<ref>Barrow</ref>  \n\n[[Folk etymology]], repeated by Boece, claims that the town's name was originally Allectum, and it was renamed ''Dei Donum'' 'Gift from God', following [[David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon|David, 8th Earl of Huntingdon]]'s arrival there on his return from the Holy Land.<ref>Boece (1527)</ref>\n\n==Early history==\nDundee and its surrounding area have been continuously occupied since the [[Mesolithic]]. A kitchen [[midden]] of that date was unearthed during work on the harbour in 1879, and yielded flints, charcoal and a stone axe.<ref>Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland: Dundee, Stannergate; Mathewson(1878\u201379)</ref>\n\nA [[Neolithic]] [[cursus]], with associated [[tumulus|barrows]] has been identified at the north-western end of the city<ref>Historic Scotland: Greystane Lodge, cursus and barrows</ref> and nearby lies the Balgarthno [[stone circle]].<ref>Jervise (1854\u201357); Historic Scotland: Gourdie, stone circle</ref> A lack of [[Stratigraphy#Archaeological stratigraphy|stratigraphy]] around the stone circle has left it difficult to determine a precise age,<ref>Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland: Balgarthno Stone Circle</ref> but it is thought to date from around the late [[Neolithic]]/early [[Bronze Age]].<ref>The Council for Scottish Archaeology: Balgarthno Stone Circle</ref> The circle has been subject to vandalism in the past and has recently been fenced off to protect it.<ref>BBC News: Stone circle protected by fence</ref> Bronze Age finds are fairly abundant in Dundee and the surrounding area, particularly in the form of short [[cist]] burials.<ref>See for example: Coutts (1963\u201364); Kerr (1896)</ref>\n\nFrom the [[Iron age]], perhaps the most prominent remains are of the Law Hill Fort,<ref>Driscoll (1995)</ref> although domestic remains are also well represented.<ref>Gibson (1989)</ref> Near to Dundee can be found the well-characterised [[souterrain]]s at Carlungie and Ardestie, which date from around the 2nd century AD.<ref>Armit (1999)</ref> Several [[broch]]s are also found in the area, including the ruins at Laws Hill near [[Monifieth]],<ref name=feachem>Feachem(1977); Brand-dd.com: Drumsturdy Broch</ref> at Craighill<ref>Feachem (1977); Historic Scotland: Craig Hill, fort and broch</ref> and at Hurley Hawkin, near [[Liff, Angus|Liff]].<ref>Feachem (1977); Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland: Hurly Hawkin; Taylor (1982)</ref>\n\n==Early Middle Ages==\n[[File:Strathmartine castle stone.jpg|right|thumb|The Strathmartine Castle Stone, a type I [[Pictish stone]]]]\nThe early medieval history of the town relies heavily on tradition. In Pictish times, the part of Dundee that was later expanded into the Burghal town in the twelfth/13th centuries was a minor settlement in the kingdom of Circinn, later known as [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]].<ref>Barrow (1990); Chadwick (1949)</ref> An area roughly equivalent to the current urban area of Dundee is likely to have formed a [[demesne]], centred on Dundee castle.<ref name=\"Barrow 1990\">Barrow (1990)</ref>\n\n[[Hector Boece|Boece]] records the ancient name of the settlement as ''Alectum''.<ref>Boece (1527) p325</ref> While there is evidence this name was being used to refer to the town in the 18th century,<ref>Small (1842)</ref> its early attribution should be treated with caution as Boece's reliability as a source is questionable.<ref>Ferguson (1998)</ref>\n\nThe Chronicle of Huntingdon (c1290) records a battle on 20 July 834 AD between the [[Scottish people|Scots]], led by Alpin (father of [[Kenneth MacAlpin]]), and the [[Picts]], which supposedly took place at the former village of Pitalpin (NO 370 329). The battle was allegedly a decisive victory for the Picts, and Alpin is said to have been executed by beheading.<ref name = \"SkeneCeltic\">Skene (1886); (1867)</ref> This account, while perhaps appealing, should be treated with caution as the battle's historical authenticity is in doubt.<ref>Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland: Pitalpin, Battle Site</ref>\n\n==High Middle Ages==\nTradition names Dundee as the location of a court palace of the [[List of monarchs of Scotland#House of Dunkeld.2C 1034\u20131286|House of Dunkeld]].<ref>Mackie (1836); Ordnance Survey (1857): Town plan of Dundee; Wilson (c1883); Fordun (1360); Wyntoun (c1420)</ref> However, no physical trace of such a residence remains,<ref>Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland: Dundee, High St</ref> and such notions are likely to have been due to a misinterpretation of the ancient name of [[Edinburgh]], ''Dunedin''.<ref>Skene (1886</ref>\n\nDundee history as a major town dates to the charter in which [[William I of Scotland|King William]] granted the earldom of Dundee to his younger brother, [[David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon|David]] (later Earl of Huntingdon) in 1179\u20131182.<ref>Barrow (2003)</ref> Earl David is thought to have built Dundee Castle, which formerly occupied the site now occupied by St Pauls Cathedral.<ref name=\"Barrow 1990\"/>\n\nDundee's position on the Tay, with its natural harbour between St Nicholas Craig and Stannergate (now obscured by development) made it an ideal location for a trading port, which led to a period of major growth in the town as Earl David promoted the town as a burgh.<ref>Barrow (1990); Mackie (1836)</ref>\n\nOn David's death in 1219, the burgh passed first to his son, [[John of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon|John]]. John died without issue in 1237 and the burgh was divided evenly between his three sisters, with the castle becoming the property of the eldest, [[Margaret of Huntingdon, Lady of Galloway|Margaret]] and, subsequently, to her youngest daughter, [[Dervorguilla of Galloway|Dervorguilla]]. Dervorguilla's portion of the burgh later passed to her eldest surviving son, [[John of Scotland|John Balliol]], and the town became a [[Royal Burgh]] on the coronation of John as king in 1292.<ref name=\"Barrow 1990\"/>\n\nDundee experienced periods of occupation and destruction in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Following [[John Balliol]]'s renunciation (1295) of [[Edward I of England|Edward I's]] claimed authority over Scotland, the English King twice visited Scotland with hostile intent. Edward (the 'Hammer of the Scots') revoked Dundee's royal charter, removing the town's people the right to control [[Local government of Scotland|local government]] and the judiciary. He occupied the Castle at Dundee at the outbreak of the [[First War of Scottish Independence|First War of Independence]] in 1296 but the castle retaken by siege by the forces of [[William Wallace]] in 1297, immediately prior to the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]].<ref name=\"Barrow 1990\"/>\n\nFrom 1303 to 1312 the city was again occupied. Edward's removal resulted in the complete destruction of the Castle by [[Robert the Bruce]], who had been proclaimed [[King of Scots]] at nearby [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] in 1306. In 1327, the Bruce granted the [[royal burgh]] a new charter.<ref name=\"Mackie 1836\">Mackie (1836)</ref> Later in the 14th century, during the conflict between England and France known as the [[Hundred Years' War]], the French invoked the [[Auld Alliance]], drawing [[Scotland]] into the hostilities. [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] subsequently marched northward and razed [[Edinburgh]], [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] and Dundee.\n\n==Early Modern Era==\n[[File:Wishart Arch.jpg|thumb|The Wishart Arch is believed to be the only surviving part of the city walls]] Dundee became a [[walled city]] in 1545 during a period of English hostilities known as the [[rough wooing]] ([[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s attempt to extend his Protestant ambitions north by marrying his youngest son [[Edward VI of England|Edward, Duke of Cornwall]] to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]). The Wishart Arch was believed to be the only remaining part of the wall though a piece behind St Paul's Cathedral may have survived, though this remains unconfirmed pursuant to further investigation. Mary maintained the alliance with the French, who captured Protestant opponents, including [[John Knox]], at [[St Andrews Castle]], in nearby east Fife in July 1547. That year, following victory at the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]], the English occupied Edinburgh and went on to destroy much of Dundee by naval bombardment. [[The Howff]] Burial Ground, granted to the people of Dundee in 1546, was a gift from Mary. In July 1547, much of the city was destroyed by an English naval bombardment.\n\nDuring a period of relative peace between Scotland and England, the status of Dundee as a [[royal burgh]] was reconfirmed (in [[The Great Charter]] of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], dated 14 September 1641). In 1645, during the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], Dundee was again besieged, this time by the Royalist [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]].<ref>Gazetteer for Scotland: Overview of James Graham</ref><ref>Bartholomew (1887)</ref> On 1 September 1651, during the [[Third English Civil War]], the city was attacked by [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s Parliamentarian forces, led by [[General Monck|George Monk]]. Much of the city was destroyed and many of its inhabitants killed.<ref name=\"Mackie 1836\"/> (see [[Siege of Dundee (1651)]])\n\nDundee was later the site of an early [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] uprising when [[John Graham of Claverhouse, 1st Viscount Dundee]] raised the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] standard on [[Law, Dundee|Dundee Law]] in 1689. This show of support of [[James VII]] (James II of England) following his overthrow, earned the Viscount the nickname [[Bonnie Dundee]].<ref>Gazetteer for Scotland: Overview of John Graham of Claverhouse</ref><ref>{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst70.html | title = Overview of John Graham of Claverhouse | work = Gazetteer for Scotland | publisher = University of Edinburgh | accessdate = 9 July 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Modern era==\nDundee greatly expanded in size during the [[Industrial Revolution]] mainly because of the burgeoning British Empire trade, flax and then latterly the [[jute]] industry.<ref>A vision of Britain through time: Dundee Total Population</ref> By the end of the 19th century, a majority of the city's workers were employed in its many jute mills and in related industries. Dundee's location on a major estuary allowed for the easy importation of jute from the [[Indian subcontinent]] as well as [[whale oil]]\u2014needed for the processing of the jute\u2014from the city's large [[whaling]] industry. A substantial coastal marine trade also developed, with inshore shipping working between the city of Dundee and the port of London. The industry began to decline in the 20th century as it became cheaper to process the cloth on the Indian subcontinent.

The \"jam\" association refers to [[marmalade]], which was purportedly invented in the city by [[Janet Keiller]] in 1797 (although in reality, recipes for marmalade have been found dating back to the 16th century). [[Keiller's marmalade]] became a famous brand because of its mass production and its worldwide export. The industry was never a major employer compared with the jute trade.<ref name=\"jam\">Keiller's: Sticky Success</ref> Marmalade has since become the \"preserve\" of larger businesses, but jars of Keiller's marmalade are still widely available. \"Journalism\" refers to the publishing firm [[D. C. Thomson & Co.

These merged in 1888 to form the [[Alliance Trust]]. Many of the investors in this trust were notable local figures including land gentry, such as the [[Earl of Airlie]], merchants, ship owners, ship builders and  jute barons and other textile manufacturers. The Alliance Trust shared its headquarters with another Dundee based trust the Western & Hawaiian Investment Company, later known as the Second Alliance Trust. The two would finally merge into one firm in 2006. The two Alliance Trusts' original main interests were focused on mortgages and land business principally in agricultural areas of the western United States (notably [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]] and [[Texas]]) and [[Hawaii]]. The company also leased mineral rights of properties in Texas and [[Oklahoma]], as well as investing in various ventures in Britain and abroad. In 2008 the company was listed on the [[FTSE 100 Index]] and the next year moved to new purpose-built headquarters.<ref name=\"ATarchive\">{{cite web|title=MS 335 Alliance Trust Archive|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27ms%20335%27%29|website=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"FraserAT\">{{cite news|last1=Fraser|first1=Douglas|title=Who to trust at Alliance Trust?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-32464742|accessdate=8 May 2018|work=BBC News|date=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nDundee also developed a major maritime and shipbuilding industry in the 19th century. 2,000 ships were built in Dundee between 1871 and 1881, including the Antarctic research ship used by [[Robert Falcon Scott]], the ''[[RRS Discovery]]''.

First, the jute industry was protected from cheap imports by the state. Tariffs and quotas were not allowed by the [[GATT]] agreements. Instead protection came through the continuation from 1945 into the 1970s of the wartime Jute Control system, by which the Ministry of Materials imported jute goods and sold them at an artificial price related to the cost of manufacture in Dundee.<ref>Tomlinson, et al ''The Decline of Jute'', pp. 122\u201323.</ref> Secondly, the jute firms agreed to company consolidation to make themselves more efficient, to increase labour productivity, and to cooperate in developing new fibres and goods. Third, labour unions and management ended the hard feelings that caused so much labour unrest and had come to a head in the dismal decade of unemployment in the 1930s. In the postwar cooperation, employers, unions and the city spoke with one voice.  Success in managing jute's decline, and the brief brief{{clarify|date=September 2014|reason=That second \"brief\" needs to be replaced by a noun, but what?}} of multinational corporations like NCR and [[Timex Corporation|Timex]], held off decline and there was relative full employment in the city down to the 1970s.  The golden age ended in the 1980s as the multinationals found cheaper labour in Bangladesh, India, and South America, and the Thatcher government ended state support for British industry. By the 1990s jute had disappeared from Dundee.<ref>Tomlinson, et al ''The Decline of Jute'', p. 160</ref>\n\nThe [[Timex Corporation]] was a major employer in the city in the post-war era, but in the early 1980s financial difficulties led to attempts to streamline its operations in Dundee.

Dundee's industrial heritage is traditionally summarised as \"the three Js\": jute, jam and journalism. East-central Scotland became too heavily dependent on linens, hemp, and jute. Despite Indian competition and the cyclical nature of the trade which periodically ruined weaker companies, profits held up well in the 19th century. Typical firms were family affairs, even after the introduction of limited liability in the 1890s. The profits, either taken from the firms or left on interest, helped make the city an important source of overseas investment, especially in North America.  The profits were seldom invested locally, apart from the linen trade, because low wages limited local consumption, and because there were no important  natural resources, the region offered little opportunity for profitable industrial diversification.<ref>Bruce Lenman, and Kathleen Donaldson,  \"Partners' Incomes, Investment and Diversification in the Scottish Linen Area 1850\u20131921,\" ''Business History,'' January 1971, Vol. 13#1 pp 1\u201318</ref>\n \n[[File:Cox's stack 02SEP05.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Cox's Stack, a chimney from the former Camperdown works jute mill.

During the 18th and 19th Centuries, [[flax]] was imported from the countries surrounding the [[Baltic Sea]] for the production of [[linen]]. The trade supported 36 spinning mills by 1835, but various conflicts, including the [[Crimean War]], put a stop to the trade. Textiles thus formed an important part of the economy long before the introduction of jute, but it was jute for rope-making and rough fabrics that helped put Dundee on the map of world trade.<ref>Louise Miskell and C.

(Dundee's 'jute barons' had invested heavily in Indian factories). By 1951 only 18.5% of Dundee's workforce was employed in the jute industry, with the total number of female workers employed in the industry declining by 62%.<ref name=Carstairs/> In 1942, the Ashton Works were requisitioned by the Government and taken over by \"Briggs Motor Bodies Ltd\" for the production of [[jerrycan]]s. Ten million were produced by the time of derequisition in 1946. The Cragie works closed for economic reasons at the end of 1954 when a study found that it was not viable to modernised equipment; production was subsequently moved to Ashton works. Commercial jute production in Dundee ceased in the 1970s, particularly after the cessation of jute control on 30 April 1969.<ref name=\"jute\">General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade</ref> Some manufacturers successfully diversified to produce [[synthetic fiber|synthetic fibres]] and [[linoleum]] for a short time.

This account is most likely apocryphal, as recipes for marmalade have been found dating back to the 16th century, with the Keillers likely to have developed their marmalade by modifying an existing recipe for [[Quince cheese|quince marmalade]]. Nevertheless, marmalade became a famed Dundee export after Alex Keiller, James' son, industrialised the production process during the 19th century.<ref name=\"jam\"/>\n\nThe Keillers originally started selling their produce from a small sweet shop in the Seagate area of the city which specialised in selling locally preserved fruit and jams. In 1845, Alex Keiller moved the business from the Seagate and into a new larger premises on Castle Street. Later, he also later bought premises in [[Guernsey]] to take advantage of the lack of sugar duties. The Guernsey premises accounted for a third of the firm's output but still carried the Dundee logo. The Guernsey plant was closed in 1879 due to lack of profitability and was moved to [[Woolwich|North Woolwich]] where it was brought back under the control of the Dundee branch. Though iconic to the city, jam was never a major sector of the city's industry, employing approximately 300 people at its peak compared to the thousands who worked in the Jute industry at the same time.<ref name=\"jam\" /> Today traditional marmalade production has become the preserve of larger businesses, but distinctive white jars of [[Keiller's marmalade]] can still be bought. For many years, these were made by the [[Maling pottery]] of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].\n\n==Journalism==\nJournalism in Dundee generally refers to the publishing company of [[D. C. Thomson & Co.

In 1857, the whaling ship ''Tay'' was the first in the world to be fitted with [[steam engine]]s.<ref name=\"whaling\"/> By 1872 Dundee had become the premier whaling port of the [[British Isles]], partly due to the local jute industry's demand for whale oil for use in the processing of its cloth. Over 2,000 ships were built in the city between 1871 and 1881. The last whaling ship to be built at Dundee was {{ship||Terra Nova|ship|2}} in 1884. The whaling industry ended around 1912.<ref name=\"whaling\" /> The last connection between Dundee and the whaling industry ended in 1922 with the loss of the trading [[ketch]], 'Easonian', which was owned by the Dundee-based shipping agents and charter company Robert Kinnes & Sons.

The incident was popular with the public and extra rail journeys were organised to assist those from surrounding areas who wished to see the whale. The creature became known as the [[Tay Whale]], and the event was also celebrated in a poem by [[William McGonagall]].\n\nThe [[Dundee Perth and London Shipping Company]] (DPLC) ran [[steamship]]s down the Tay from [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] and on to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and London. The firm still exists, but is now a travel agency. However, [[shipbuilding]] shrank with the closure of the five berths at the former [[Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company]] in 1981, and came to an end altogether in 1987 when the Kestrel Marine yard was closed with the loss of 750 jobs.\n\n{{ship|RRS|Discovery}}, the ship taken to the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and the last wooden three-masted ship to be built in the British Isles, was built in Dundee in 1901.<ref name=\"Huntford 1986\"/> It returned to Dundee in April 1986 initially being moored in Victoria Dock. Since 1992 Discovery has been moored next to a purpose-built visitors' centre, Discovery Point.

The most prominent wharfs are King George V, Caledon West, Princess Alexandra, Eastern and Caledon East. The Victoria Dock was built in the 19th century to serve the loading of major imports of jute. Activity ceased in the 1960s and the wharf was out of service for forty years. It has since been redeveloped into a shopping wharf known as ''City Quay''. The Quay has a 500-yard Millennium Bridge spanning its eastern quay which swings round to allow ships in. Camperdown docklands {{As of|2006|lc=on}} is also being redeveloped in a manner similar to [[Canary Wharf]] in London and is scheduled for completion in 2008. The last wharf to be built in Dundee was at Stannergate for the shipbuilders Kestrel Marine. It was formally opened by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] on 17 July 1979 and named after him.<ref name=\"pcwharf\">Prince Charles opens new wharf</ref>\n\n==Tay Bridge Disaster==\n[[File:Original Tay Bridge before the 1879 collapse.jpg|thumb|left|Original Tay Bridge (from the north)]]\nIn 1878 a new [[Tay Rail Bridge|railway bridge over the Tay]] was opened, connecting the rail network at Dundee to [[Fife]] and [[Edinburgh]]. Its completion was commemorated in verse by [[William McGonagall]]. About two years after completion, the bridge collapsed under the weight of a full train of passengers during a fierce storm. All on board the train were lost and some bodies were never recovered.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> McGonagall's ''[[The Tay Bridge Disaster]]'' recounts the [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]] in verse. perhaps one of his best known poems. [[File:Tay bridge down.JPG|thumb|Original Tay Bridge (from the South) the day after the disaster.]]  The public inquiry of the [[Tay Bridge disaster]] in 1880 found that the bridge had been \"badly designed, badly built and badly maintained\" and Sir [[Thomas Bouch]] was blamed for the catastrophe. He had under-designed the structure and used brittle [[cast iron]] for critical components, especially the lugs which held tensioned [[tie bar]]s in the towers. It was these lugs which fractured first and destabilised the towers in the high girders section. The bolt holes in the lugs were cast, and had a conical section, so all the load was concentrated at a sharp outer edge. Such conical [[Screw|bolt]] holes were used for critical horizontal [[strut]] lugs as well, and weakened the structure substantially. The towers of the high girder section were heavily loaded and were very top heavy, making then susceptible to toppling. The towers failed during the storm as the train was travelling over, and a chain reaction followed as each of the towers in the high girders section collapsed. In 1887 the bridge was replaced by [[William Henry Barlow]] with a much more substantial bridge, which was at that time the longest railway bridge in Europe, at just over {{convert|2|mi}} long (Europe's longest bridge today is the [[Oresund Bridge]]).\n\n==Public transport==\n{{See also|Dundee Corporation Tramways}}\n\n===Trams===\nThe first municipal public transport in Dundee was operated by [[Dundee and District Tramways]]. From 1877, these were generally horse-drawn, but by June 1885 [[Tram#Steam|steam cars]] with green and white livery were introduced. Unusually, the tram lines were publicly built and owned, although initially leased by police commissionaires to private companies.<ref name=\"tramown\">Whitley, Swinfen & Smith (1993)</ref>\n\nAll routes came under direct municipal control in 1893, which allowed the city to adopt overhead electric lines to power the trams. Between 1899 and 1902 the tramways were fully electrified. The first electric tram in Dundee started on 12 July 1900. The route ran from High Street to Ninewells in the West ''via'' Nethergate and Perth Road with a later route running to Dryburgh in the North. The peak of the tram network was in 1932, when 79 lines operated in the city. By 1951, many of the trams had not been updated. At least a third of the stock was over 50 years old. A study led by the Belfast transport consultant, Colonel R McCreary showed that the cost of trams compared with bus service was 26.700 and 21.204 pence per mile, respectively. He advocated abandoning the tramway system in 1952. In October 1956, the last trams were quietly taken out of service.<ref name=\"tramstop\">Fitt and Robson (2006)</ref> On the evening of 20 October 1956 the last tram (#25) went to Maryfield Depot. Over 5,000 people witnessed the tram leaving the depot at 12:31&nbsp;am to go to the [[Lochee]] depot. All remaining cars were reduced to scrap by burning.\n\n===Buses===\nThe first [[trolleybus]]es in Scotland were introduced along Clepington Road in Dundee during 1912\u20131914.<ref name=\"cleptrol\">Dundee 1912: handbook and guide to Dundee and district</ref> However, [[Bus|motor buses]] were gradually introduced from 1921 to supplement the tram system, and [[double-decker bus]]es appeared ten&nbsp;years later. Electric-powered operated by \"Dundee Corporation Electricity Works\" were still used in parts of the city until 1961. In 1975, Dundee Corporation Transport became part of the new [[Tayside]] Regional Council. Tayside adopted a new dark blue, white and light blue livery for its buses, replacing the former dark green. The [[Volvo Ailsa]] double deck bus became standard in the Tayside fleet during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1986, following bus deregulation, Tayside Buses was formed as a separate company. It was later privatised and bought out by [[National Express]] and now trades as [[Xplore Dundee]].\n\nDundee (and the surrounding countryside) was also served by buses of [[Walter Alexander Coachbuilders|Walter Alexander]] (part of the state-owned [[Scottish Transport Group]]), which was rebranded as [[Northern Scottish]] in the early 1960s. In the 1980s the Tayside operation of Northern Scottish became a separate company, [[Strathtay Scottish]]. The company was privatised in the late 1980s.\n\n===Rail===\nRail transport in Dundee began with the [[Dundee and Newtyle Railway]] Company which was formed in 1826 and was the first railway to be built in the North of Scotland.

Various plans were put forward to concentrate all Dundee's railway facilities in a new central station. This idea was first mooted in 1864 by [[John Leng (politician)|John Leng]], then the editor of the ''Dundee Advertiser'', and the idea re-emerged in 1872 following the start of work on the [[Tay Rail Bridge]]. The concept was also put forward for a final time in 1896.  Various sites for a central station were put forwardincluding building it between the High Street and the harbour, between the Murraygate and the Meadows and on a waterfront site created by partially filling in two of Dundee's docks. However none of these proposals were ever released and the three distinct stations survived as independent entities.<ref name=\"McKeanetal\">{{cite book|last1=McKean|first1=Charles|last2=Whatley|first2=Patricia|last3=with Baxter|first3=Kenneth|title=Lost Dundee.

Popularly known in Dundee as ''\"the Fifie\"'', the service was withdrawn in August 1966, being replaced by the newly opened [[Tay Road Bridge]].\n\nThree vessels latterly operated the service \u2013 the [[paddle steamer]] ''B.

After the [[Reformation]] its running was taken over by the town council and it was used to house and care for a dozen 'decayed [[burgess (title)|burgesses]]'. The original building was replaced in about 1678. During the 18th century it was decided it was better to care for the needy in their own homes and the hospital was then used for other purposes. Tay Street was built on its extensive gardens, and [[St Andrew's Cathedral, Dundee|St Andrews Cathedral]] was later erected on the site of the hospital itself.<ref name=\"Town Hospital\">{{cite book|last=McKean|first=Charles, and Whatley, Patricia, with Baxter, Kenneth|title=Lost Dundee: Dundee's lost Architectural Heritage|year=2008|publisher=Birlinn|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-84158-562-8|pages=51\u201353}}</ref>\n\nIn 1798 an infirmary was opened in King Street which would serve as the principal hospital in Dundee for almost 200 years.

Above the shield is a single lily and above that a scroll with the motto ''Dei Donum'', gift of God.\n\nThe blue colour of the shield is said to represent the cloak of the Virgin Mary while the silver (white) lilies are also closely associated with her. There is an early carving in the city\u2019s Old Steeple, showing a similar coat of arms with Mary, protecting her child with a shield from dragons. Following an Act of Parliament passed in 1672, Dundee\u2019s \u2018new\u2019 coat of arms was matriculated in the office of the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] on 30 July 1673. However, by this time Scotland had become a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] nation, and any such idolatry of the Virgin Mary would have been frowned upon, leading to the more subtle symbolism that appears today. There are different theories as to why Dragons came to be used as supporters. One is that on the earlier arms they represent the violent sea that the Virgin Mary protected David from. Another is that they relate to the local legend of the [[Strathmartine Dragon]].\n\nOver the years small changes crept in until in 1932 the City Council decided to ask the Lord Lyon King of Arms about the correct form. Amongst other differences he pointed out that the dragons on the coat of arms were actually wyverns. (Although closely related wyverns have only two legs while dragons have four.) The coat of arms above the [[Eastern Cemetery]] gateway shows wyverns instead of dragons and three lilies above the shield instead of one. It was decided to go back to the original form with dragon supporters and one lily and to add a second motto \u2018Prudentia et Candore\u2019 \u2013 Wisdom and Truth.\n\nThe coat of arms was slightly modified in 1975 when the City of Dundee District Council was created under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]]. A coronet, with thistle heads, was incorporated; this emblem being common to the coats of arms of all Scottish district councils. A further modification took place in 1996, when the District Council was replaced by the current Dundee City Council; the design of the coronet was revised to the present format.\n\n==Important People Associated with Dundee==\n\n===Winston Churchill===\nBetween 1908 and 1922, one of the city's Members of Parliament was [[Winston Churchill]], at that time a member of the (Coalition) [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. He had won the seat at a by-election on 8 May 1908 and was initially popular, especially as he was the [[President of the Board of Trade]] and, later, senior Cabinet minister. However, his frequent absence from Dundee on cabinet business, combined with the local bitterness and disillusionment that was caused by the [[World War I|Great War]] strained this relationship. In the buildup to the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]], even the local newspapers contained vitriolic rhetoric with regards to his political status in the city. At a one meeting he was only able to speak for 40 minutes when he was barracked by a section of the audience.<ref>Churchill Howled Down</ref> Prevented from campaigning in the final days of his reelection campaign by [[appendicitis]], his wife [[Clementine Churchill|Clementine]] was even spat on for wearing [[pearls]].<ref>McGrath (2006)</ref>  Churchill was ousted by the [[Scottish Prohibition Party|Scottish Prohibitionist]] [[Edwin Scrymgeour]] \u2013 Scrymgeour's sixth election attempt \u2013 and indeed came only fourth in the poll. Churchill would later write that he left Dundee ''\"short of an appendix, seat and party\"''.<ref>All the Elections Churchill Ever Contested</ref> In 1943 he was offered [[Freedom of the City]] \u2014 by 16 votes to 15 \u2013 but refused to accept.

The present version is based on the coat of arms granted by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] in 1673.]] -->\n[[Dundee]] ({{lang-gd|D\u00f9n D\u00e8agh}}) is the fourth-largest [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] in [[Scotland]] with a population of around 150,000 people. It is situated on the north bank of the [[Firth of Tay]] on the east coast of the [[Central Lowlands]] of Scotland. The Dundee area has been settled since the [[Mesolithic]] with evidence of [[Picts|Pictish]] habitation beginning in the [[Iron Age]]. During the [[Medieval Era]] the city became a prominent trading port and was the site of many battles. Throughout the [[Industrial Revolution]], the local [[jute]] industry caused the city to grow rapidly. In this period, Dundee also gained prominence due to its marmalade industry and its journalism, giving Dundee its epithet as the city of \"jute, jam and journalism\".\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe name \"Dundee\" is of uncertain etymology. It incorporates the place-name element ''d\u00f9n'', fort, present in both [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] and in [[Brythonic languages]] such as [[Pictish]].<ref>Taylor (1898); Forsyth (1997)</ref> The remainder of the name is less obvious.

Dervorguilla's portion of the burgh later passed to her eldest surviving son, [[John of Scotland|John Balliol]], and the town became a [[Royal Burgh]] on the coronation of John as king in 1292.<ref name=\"Barrow 1990\"/>\n\nDundee experienced periods of occupation and destruction in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Following [[John Balliol]]'s renunciation (1295) of [[Edward I of England|Edward I's]] claimed authority over Scotland, the English King twice visited Scotland with hostile intent. Edward (the 'Hammer of the Scots') revoked Dundee's royal charter, removing the town's people the right to control [[Local government of Scotland|local government]] and the judiciary.

Edward's removal resulted in the complete destruction of the Castle by [[Robert the Bruce]], who had been proclaimed [[King of Scots]] at nearby [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] in 1306. In 1327, the Bruce granted the [[royal burgh]] a new charter.<ref name=\"Mackie 1836\">Mackie (1836)</ref> Later in the 14th century, during the conflict between England and France known as the [[Hundred Years' War]], the French invoked the [[Auld Alliance]], drawing [[Scotland]] into the hostilities.

The Wishart Arch was believed to be the only remaining part of the wall though a piece behind St Paul's Cathedral may have survived, though this remains unconfirmed pursuant to further investigation. Mary maintained the alliance with the French, who captured Protestant opponents, including [[John Knox]], at [[St Andrews Castle]], in nearby east Fife in July 1547. That year, following victory at the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]], the English occupied Edinburgh and went on to destroy much of Dundee by naval bombardment. [[The Howff]] Burial Ground, granted to the people of Dundee in 1546, was a gift from Mary. In July 1547, much of the city was destroyed by an English naval bombardment.\n\nDuring a period of relative peace between Scotland and England, the status of Dundee as a [[royal burgh]] was reconfirmed (in [[The Great Charter]] of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], dated 14 September 1641). In 1645, during the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], Dundee was again besieged, this time by the Royalist [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]].<ref>Gazetteer for Scotland: Overview of James Graham</ref><ref>Bartholomew (1887)</ref> On 1 September 1651, during the [[Third English Civil War]], the city was attacked by [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s Parliamentarian forces, led by [[General Monck|George Monk]].

Dundee's location on a major estuary allowed for the easy importation of jute from the [[Indian subcontinent]] as well as [[whale oil]]\u2014needed for the processing of the jute\u2014from the city's large [[whaling]] industry. A substantial coastal marine trade also developed, with inshore shipping working between the city of Dundee and the port of London. The industry began to decline in the 20th century as it became cheaper to process the cloth on the Indian subcontinent. The city's last jute mill closed in the 1970s.\n[[File:SCO Dundee, Tay Rail Bridge.jpg|thumb|The original [[Tay Rail Bridge|Tay Bridge]] (from the south) the day after the disaster.

The \"jam\" association refers to [[marmalade]], which was purportedly invented in the city by [[Janet Keiller]] in 1797 (although in reality, recipes for marmalade have been found dating back to the 16th century). [[Keiller's marmalade]] became a famous brand because of its mass production and its worldwide export. The industry was never a major employer compared with the jute trade.<ref name=\"jam\">Keiller's: Sticky Success</ref> Marmalade has since become the \"preserve\" of larger businesses, but jars of Keiller's marmalade are still widely available. \"Journalism\" refers to the publishing firm [[D.

These merged in 1888 to form the [[Alliance Trust]]. Many of the investors in this trust were notable local figures including land gentry, such as the [[Earl of Airlie]], merchants, ship owners, ship builders and  jute barons and other textile manufacturers. The Alliance Trust shared its headquarters with another Dundee based trust the Western & Hawaiian Investment Company, later known as the Second Alliance Trust. The two would finally merge into one firm in 2006. The two Alliance Trusts' original main interests were focused on mortgages and land business principally in agricultural areas of the western United States (notably [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]] and [[Texas]]) and [[Hawaii]]. The company also leased mineral rights of properties in Texas and [[Oklahoma]], as well as investing in various ventures in Britain and abroad. In 2008 the company was listed on the [[FTSE 100 Index]] and the next year moved to new purpose-built headquarters.<ref name=\"ATarchive\">{{cite web|title=MS 335 Alliance Trust Archive|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27ms%20335%27%29|website=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"FraserAT\">{{cite news|last1=Fraser|first1=Douglas|title=Who to trust at Alliance Trust?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-32464742|accessdate=8 May 2018|work=BBC News|date=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nDundee also developed a major maritime and shipbuilding industry in the 19th century. 2,000 ships were built in Dundee between 1871 and 1881, including the Antarctic research ship used by [[Robert Falcon Scott]], the ''[[RRS Discovery]]''.

First, the jute industry was protected from cheap imports by the state. Tariffs and quotas were not allowed by the [[GATT]] agreements. Instead protection came through the continuation from 1945 into the 1970s of the wartime Jute Control system, by which the Ministry of Materials imported jute goods and sold them at an artificial price related to the cost of manufacture in Dundee.<ref>Tomlinson, et al ''The Decline of Jute'', pp. 122\u201323.</ref> Secondly, the jute firms agreed to company consolidation to make themselves more efficient, to increase labour productivity, and to cooperate in developing new fibres and goods. Third, labour unions and management ended the hard feelings that caused so much labour unrest and had come to a head in the dismal decade of unemployment in the 1930s. In the postwar cooperation, employers, unions and the city spoke with one voice.  Success in managing jute's decline, and the brief brief{{clarify|date=September 2014|reason=That second \"brief\" needs to be replaced by a noun, but what?}} of multinational corporations like NCR and [[Timex Corporation|Timex]], held off decline and there was relative full employment in the city down to the 1970s.

Dundee's industrial heritage is traditionally summarised as \"the three Js\": jute, jam and journalism. East-central Scotland became too heavily dependent on linens, hemp, and jute. Despite Indian competition and the cyclical nature of the trade which periodically ruined weaker companies, profits held up well in the 19th century. Typical firms were family affairs, even after the introduction of limited liability in the 1890s. The profits, either taken from the firms or left on interest, helped make the city an important source of overseas investment, especially in North America.  The profits were seldom invested locally, apart from the linen trade, because low wages limited local consumption, and because there were no important  natural resources, the region offered little opportunity for profitable industrial diversification.<ref>Bruce Lenman, and Kathleen Donaldson,  \"Partners' Incomes, Investment and Diversification in the Scottish Linen Area 1850\u20131921,\" ''Business History,'' January 1971, Vol. 13#1 pp 1\u201318</ref>\n \n[[File:Cox's stack 02SEP05.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Cox's Stack, a chimney from the former Camperdown works jute mill.

During the 18th and 19th Centuries, [[flax]] was imported from the countries surrounding the [[Baltic Sea]] for the production of [[linen]]. The trade supported 36 spinning mills by 1835, but various conflicts, including the [[Crimean War]], put a stop to the trade. Textiles thus formed an important part of the economy long before the introduction of jute, but it was jute for rope-making and rough fabrics that helped put Dundee on the map of world trade.<ref>Louise Miskell and C.

By 1951 only 18.5% of Dundee's workforce was employed in the jute industry, with the total number of female workers employed in the industry declining by 62%.<ref name=Carstairs/> In 1942, the Ashton Works were requisitioned by the Government and taken over by \"Briggs Motor Bodies Ltd\" for the production of [[jerrycan]]s. Ten million were produced by the time of derequisition in 1946. The Cragie works closed for economic reasons at the end of 1954 when a study found that it was not viable to modernised equipment; production was subsequently moved to Ashton works. Commercial jute production in Dundee ceased in the 1970s, particularly after the cessation of jute control on 30 April 1969.<ref name=\"jute\">General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade</ref> Some manufacturers successfully diversified to produce [[synthetic fiber|synthetic fibres]] and [[linoleum]] for a short time.

This account is most likely apocryphal, as recipes for marmalade have been found dating back to the 16th century, with the Keillers likely to have developed their marmalade by modifying an existing recipe for [[Quince cheese|quince marmalade]]. Nevertheless, marmalade became a famed Dundee export after Alex Keiller, James' son, industrialised the production process during the 19th century.<ref name=\"jam\"/>\n\nThe Keillers originally started selling their produce from a small sweet shop in the Seagate area of the city which specialised in selling locally preserved fruit and jams. In 1845, Alex Keiller moved the business from the Seagate and into a new larger premises on Castle Street. Later, he also later bought premises in [[Guernsey]] to take advantage of the lack of sugar duties. The Guernsey premises accounted for a third of the firm's output but still carried the Dundee logo. The Guernsey plant was closed in 1879 due to lack of profitability and was moved to [[Woolwich|North Woolwich]] where it was brought back under the control of the Dundee branch. Though iconic to the city, jam was never a major sector of the city's industry, employing approximately 300 people at its peak compared to the thousands who worked in the Jute industry at the same time.<ref name=\"jam\" /> Today traditional marmalade production has become the preserve of larger businesses, but distinctive white jars of [[Keiller's marmalade]] can still be bought. For many years, these were made by the [[Maling pottery]] of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].\n\n==Journalism==\nJournalism in Dundee generally refers to the publishing company of [[D. C. Thomson & Co.

In 1857, the whaling ship ''Tay'' was the first in the world to be fitted with [[steam engine]]s.<ref name=\"whaling\"/> By 1872 Dundee had become the premier whaling port of the [[British Isles]], partly due to the local jute industry's demand for whale oil for use in the processing of its cloth. Over 2,000 ships were built in the city between 1871 and 1881. The last whaling ship to be built at Dundee was {{ship||Terra Nova|ship|2}} in 1884. The whaling industry ended around 1912.<ref name=\"whaling\" /> The last connection between Dundee and the whaling industry ended in 1922 with the loss of the trading [[ketch]], 'Easonian', which was owned by the Dundee-based shipping agents and charter company Robert Kinnes & Sons. Kinnes & Sons had been formed in 1883 by the managing director of the Tay Whale Fishing Company.<ref name=\"Tay Whale fishing\">{{cite web|title=MS 59 Tay Whale Fishing Company (Microfilm)|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27ms%2059%27%29|website=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1883, a whale was caught in the Tay and was later publicly dissected by [[John Struthers (anatomist)|Professor John Struthers]] of the [[University of Aberdeen]]. The incident was popular with the public and extra rail journeys were organised to assist those from surrounding areas who wished to see the whale. The creature became known as the [[Tay Whale]], and the event was also celebrated in a poem by [[William McGonagall]].\n\nThe [[Dundee Perth and London Shipping Company]] (DPLC) ran [[steamship]]s down the Tay from [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] and on to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and London. The firm still exists, but is now a travel agency. However, [[shipbuilding]] shrank with the closure of the five berths at the former [[Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company]] in 1981, and came to an end altogether in 1987 when the Kestrel Marine yard was closed with the loss of 750 jobs.\n\n{{ship|RRS|Discovery}}, the ship taken to the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and the last wooden three-masted ship to be built in the British Isles, was built in Dundee in 1901.<ref name=\"Huntford 1986\"/> It returned to Dundee in April 1986 initially being moored in Victoria Dock.

The most prominent wharfs are King George V, Caledon West, Princess Alexandra, Eastern and Caledon East. The Victoria Dock was built in the 19th century to serve the loading of major imports of jute. Activity ceased in the 1960s and the wharf was out of service for forty years. It has since been redeveloped into a shopping wharf known as ''City Quay''. The Quay has a 500-yard Millennium Bridge spanning its eastern quay which swings round to allow ships in. Camperdown docklands {{As of|2006|lc=on}} is also being redeveloped in a manner similar to [[Canary Wharf]] in London and is scheduled for completion in 2008.

Its completion was commemorated in verse by [[William McGonagall]]. About two years after completion, the bridge collapsed under the weight of a full train of passengers during a fierce storm. All on board the train were lost and some bodies were never recovered.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> McGonagall's ''[[The Tay Bridge Disaster]]'' recounts the [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]] in verse. perhaps one of his best known poems. [[File:Tay bridge down.JPG|thumb|Original Tay Bridge (from the South) the day after the disaster.]]  The public inquiry of the [[Tay Bridge disaster]] in 1880 found that the bridge had been \"badly designed, badly built and badly maintained\" and Sir [[Thomas Bouch]] was blamed for the catastrophe. He had under-designed the structure and used brittle [[cast iron]] for critical components, especially the lugs which held tensioned [[tie bar]]s in the towers. It was these lugs which fractured first and destabilised the towers in the high girders section. The bolt holes in the lugs were cast, and had a conical section, so all the load was concentrated at a sharp outer edge. Such conical [[Screw|bolt]] holes were used for critical horizontal [[strut]] lugs as well, and weakened the structure substantially. The towers of the high girder section were heavily loaded and were very top heavy, making then susceptible to toppling. The towers failed during the storm as the train was travelling over, and a chain reaction followed as each of the towers in the high girders section collapsed. In 1887 the bridge was replaced by [[William Henry Barlow]] with a much more substantial bridge, which was at that time the longest railway bridge in Europe, at just over {{convert|2|mi}} long (Europe's longest bridge today is the [[Oresund Bridge]]).\n\n==Public transport==\n{{See also|Dundee Corporation Tramways}}\n\n===Trams===\nThe first municipal public transport in Dundee was operated by [[Dundee and District Tramways]]. From 1877, these were generally horse-drawn, but by June 1885 [[Tram#Steam|steam cars]] with green and white livery were introduced. Unusually, the tram lines were publicly built and owned, although initially leased by police commissionaires to private companies.<ref name=\"tramown\">Whitley, Swinfen & Smith (1993)</ref>\n\nAll routes came under direct municipal control in 1893, which allowed the city to adopt overhead electric lines to power the trams. Between 1899 and 1902 the tramways were fully electrified. The first electric tram in Dundee started on 12 July 1900. The route ran from High Street to Ninewells in the West ''via'' Nethergate and Perth Road with a later route running to Dryburgh in the North. The peak of the tram network was in 1932, when 79 lines operated in the city. By 1951, many of the trams had not been updated. At least a third of the stock was over 50 years old. A study led by the Belfast transport consultant, Colonel R McCreary showed that the cost of trams compared with bus service was 26.700 and 21.204 pence per mile, respectively. He advocated abandoning the tramway system in 1952. In October 1956, the last trams were quietly taken out of service.<ref name=\"tramstop\">Fitt and Robson (2006)</ref> On the evening of 20 October 1956 the last tram (#25) went to Maryfield Depot. Over 5,000 people witnessed the tram leaving the depot at 12:31&nbsp;am to go to the [[Lochee]] depot. All remaining cars were reduced to scrap by burning.\n\n===Buses===\nThe first [[trolleybus]]es in Scotland were introduced along Clepington Road in Dundee during 1912\u20131914.<ref name=\"cleptrol\">Dundee 1912: handbook and guide to Dundee and district</ref> However, [[Bus|motor buses]] were gradually introduced from 1921 to supplement the tram system, and [[double-decker bus]]es appeared ten&nbsp;years later. Electric-powered operated by \"Dundee Corporation Electricity Works\" were still used in parts of the city until 1961. In 1975, Dundee Corporation Transport became part of the new [[Tayside]] Regional Council. Tayside adopted a new dark blue, white and light blue livery for its buses, replacing the former dark green. The [[Volvo Ailsa]] double deck bus became standard in the Tayside fleet during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1986, following bus deregulation, Tayside Buses was formed as a separate company. It was later privatised and bought out by [[National Express]] and now trades as [[Xplore Dundee]].\n\nDundee (and the surrounding countryside) was also served by buses of [[Walter Alexander Coachbuilders|Walter Alexander]] (part of the state-owned [[Scottish Transport Group]]), which was rebranded as [[Northern Scottish]] in the early 1960s. In the 1980s the Tayside operation of Northern Scottish became a separate company, [[Strathtay Scottish]]. The company was privatised in the late 1980s.\n\n===Rail===\nRail transport in Dundee began with the [[Dundee and Newtyle Railway]] Company which was formed in 1826 and was the first railway to be built in the North of Scotland. The railway linking Dundee with [[Newtyle]] opened in 1832 and was eventually part of the [[Caledonian Railway]].<ref name=\"Newtyle Railway\">{{cite web|title=Archive Services Online  Catalogue MS 105/2 Dundee and Newtyle Railway Company|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27MS%20105%2F2%27%29|publisher=[[University of Dundee]]|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref> This was followed  by the [[Dundee and Arbroath Railway]] Company which was incorporated in May 1836.

Various plans were put forward to concentrate all Dundee's railway facilities in a new central station. This idea was first mooted in 1864 by [[John Leng (politician)|John Leng]], then the editor of the ''Dundee Advertiser'', and the idea re-emerged in 1872 following the start of work on the [[Tay Rail Bridge]]. The concept was also put forward for a final time in 1896.  Various sites for a central station were put forwardincluding building it between the High Street and the harbour, between the Murraygate and the Meadows and on a waterfront site created by partially filling in two of Dundee's docks. However none of these proposals were ever released and the three distinct stations survived as independent entities.<ref name=\"McKeanetal\">{{cite book|last1=McKean|first1=Charles|last2=Whatley|first2=Patricia|last3=with Baxter|first3=Kenneth|title=Lost Dundee.

Other commuter train services to [[Invergowrie railway station|Invergowrie]], [[Balmossie railway station|Balmossie]], [[Broughty Ferry railway station|Broughty Ferry]] and [[Monifieth railway station|Monifieth]] have been substantially reduced since the 1980s. Dundee East closed in 1959 and Dundee West station closed in the 1960s, with all traffic being diverted to Tay Bridge station (now simply known as Dundee station).\n\n===Tay Ferry===\nA passenger and vehicle ferry service across the River Tay operated from Craigie Pier, Dundee, to [[Newport-on-Tay]]. Popularly known in Dundee as ''\"the Fifie\"'', the service was withdrawn in August 1966, being replaced by the newly opened [[Tay Road Bridge]].\n\nThree vessels latterly operated the service \u2013 the [[paddle steamer]] ''B. L. Nairn'' (of 1929) and the two more modern ferries ''Abercraig'' and ''Scotscraig'', which were both equipped with [[Voith Schneider Propeller]]s.\n\n==Hospitals==\nThe original Town Hospital in Dundee was founded in what is now the Nethergate in 1530 to provide for the support of the sick and elderly persons dwelling in the burgh and run by the [[Trinitarians]]. After the [[Reformation]] its running was taken over by the town council and it was used to house and care for a dozen 'decayed [[burgess (title)|burgesses]]'. The original building was replaced in about 1678. During the 18th century it was decided it was better to care for the needy in their own homes and the hospital was then used for other purposes. Tay Street was built on its extensive gardens, and [[St Andrew's Cathedral, Dundee|St Andrews Cathedral]] was later erected on the site of the hospital itself.<ref name=\"Town Hospital\">{{cite book|last=McKean|first=Charles, and Whatley, Patricia, with Baxter, Kenneth|title=Lost Dundee: Dundee's lost Architectural Heritage|year=2008|publisher=Birlinn|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-84158-562-8|pages=51\u201353}}</ref>\n\nIn 1798 an infirmary was opened in King Street which would serve as the principal hospital in Dundee for almost 200 years. This hospital was granted a [[Royal Charter]] by [[George III]] in 1819, after which it became known as the \"Dundee Royal Infirmary and Asylum\". In 1820 the asylum was formally established as a separate entity in its own premises in Albert Street, and the hospital in King Street became [[Dundee Royal Infirmary]] (commonly known as DRI).

In 1879 work began on a new site for the asylum at Westgreen Farm, [[Liff, Angus|Liff]] to which all patients had been transferred by October 1882. A second building, Gowrie House was erected to the south of Westgreen for private patients. From 1903 Westgreen was owned and operated by the Dundee District Lunacy Board  as Dundee District Asylum, while Gowrie House continued as Dundee Royal Lunatic Asylum.

Above the shield is a single lily and above that a scroll with the motto ''Dei Donum'', gift of God.\n\nThe blue colour of the shield is said to represent the cloak of the Virgin Mary while the silver (white) lilies are also closely associated with her. There is an early carving in the city\u2019s Old Steeple, showing a similar coat of arms with Mary, protecting her child with a shield from dragons. Following an Act of Parliament passed in 1672, Dundee\u2019s \u2018new\u2019 coat of arms was matriculated in the office of the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] on 30 July 1673. However, by this time Scotland had become a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] nation, and any such idolatry of the Virgin Mary would have been frowned upon, leading to the more subtle symbolism that appears today. There are different theories as to why Dragons came to be used as supporters. One is that on the earlier arms they represent the violent sea that the Virgin Mary protected David from. Another is that they relate to the local legend of the [[Strathmartine Dragon]].\n\nOver the years small changes crept in until in 1932 the City Council decided to ask the Lord Lyon King of Arms about the correct form. Amongst other differences he pointed out that the dragons on the coat of arms were actually wyverns. (Although closely related wyverns have only two legs while dragons have four.) The coat of arms above the [[Eastern Cemetery]] gateway shows wyverns instead of dragons and three lilies above the shield instead of one. It was decided to go back to the original form with dragon supporters and one lily and to add a second motto \u2018Prudentia et Candore\u2019 \u2013 Wisdom and Truth.\n\nThe coat of arms was slightly modified in 1975 when the City of Dundee District Council was created under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]]. A coronet, with thistle heads, was incorporated; this emblem being common to the coats of arms of all Scottish district councils. A further modification took place in 1996, when the District Council was replaced by the current Dundee City Council; the design of the coronet was revised to the present format.\n\n==Important People Associated with Dundee==\n\n===Winston Churchill===\nBetween 1908 and 1922, one of the city's Members of Parliament was [[Winston Churchill]], at that time a member of the (Coalition) [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. He had won the seat at a by-election on 8 May 1908 and was initially popular, especially as he was the [[President of the Board of Trade]] and, later, senior Cabinet minister. However, his frequent absence from Dundee on cabinet business, combined with the local bitterness and disillusionment that was caused by the [[World War I|Great War]] strained this relationship. In the buildup to the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]], even the local newspapers contained vitriolic rhetoric with regards to his political status in the city. At a one meeting he was only able to speak for 40 minutes when he was barracked by a section of the audience.<ref>Churchill Howled Down</ref> Prevented from campaigning in the final days of his reelection campaign by [[appendicitis]], his wife [[Clementine Churchill|Clementine]] was even spat on for wearing [[pearls]].<ref>McGrath (2006)</ref>  Churchill was ousted by the [[Scottish Prohibition Party|Scottish Prohibitionist]] [[Edwin Scrymgeour]] \u2013 Scrymgeour's sixth election attempt \u2013 and indeed came only fourth in the poll.
