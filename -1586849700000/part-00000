Whiting]\" Political Science, University of Michigan March 21, 2019</ref>{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}}\n\nWhiting was [[University of Arizona]] Regents' Professor of Political Science from 1993 to his retirement, having joined the university in 1982. He graduated from [[Cornell University]] in 1948, earned a master's degree from [[Columbia University]] in 1950 and a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1952. After first joining the Department of Political Science at [[Michigan State University]], he became a researcher at the [[RAND Corporation]] and served in several capacities in the U.S. Department of State, including head of the Far Eastern Division of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research and deputy consul general in Hong Kong. He then taught at [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], 1968-1982. Whiting has been a member of the Board of Directors of the [[National Committee on United States-China Relations]], the [[Association for Asian Studies]], and the [[International Institute of Strategic Studies]].<ref>[http://www.worldlymind.org/whiting.pdf Allen S. Whiting] University of Arizona 11/18/2002</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nAllen Suess Whiting was born to Leo Robert and Viola Allen (n\u00e9e Suess) Whiting in [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey]]. He graduated from [[Cornell University]] in 1948, where he studied with [[Knight Biggerstaff]] and gained master's degree at [[Columbia University]] in 1950. In 1952 he gained PhD at Columbia University.{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}}\n\n== Career and major works ==\nWhiting was instructor of political science at [[Northwestern University]] from 1951 to 1953, but his contract was not renewed when senior colleagues felt that his interest in the Soviet Union and China were politically suspicious. He was unemployed for a time, but received a [[Ford Foundation]] grant to study language in Taiwan. While there he contracted polio, whose effects afflicted him for the rest of his life.{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}}\nBetween 1955 and 1957 he was assistant professor at [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]]. From 1957 to 1961 he was a social scientist at the [[RAND Corporation]] in [[Santa Monica, California]].{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}} Between 1962 and 1966 he worked for the [[United States Department of State]] as Director of the Office of Research and Analysis for the Far East. From 1966 to 1966 he served as Deputy Consul General in [[Hong Kong]]. Whiting continued academic career as professor of political science at [[University Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], where he worked from 1968 to 1982.{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}} He was then professor at [[University Arizona]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] between 1982 and 1993, and from then a regents professor. He was a director of the Center for East Asian Studies from 1982 to 1993. Whiting also served as a consultant for the Department of State between 1968 and 1988 and director of the National Committee on the United States-China Relation in [[New York City]] from 1977 to 1994.{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}}\nHe was an associate of the China Council from 1978 to 1988. From 1983 to 1995 he was president of the Southern Arizona China Council in Tucson and a fellow of the [[Woodrow Wilson Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] from 1995 to 1996.{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}}\n\n=== ''Sinkiang:Pawn or Pivot?'' (1958) ===\n\n[[File:Governor Sheng Shicai.jpg|thumb|Governor of Xinjiang Sheng Shicai]]\n\nHis 1958 ''Sinkiang: Pawn or Pivot?'' includes Whiting's \"Soviet Strategy in Sinkiang: 1933-49\" (pp.&nbsp;3\u2013148), which analyzes the background and the international rivalry between Moscow and the Chinese central government in this period, and \"Red Failure in Sinkiang,\" the memoirs of [[Sheng Shicai]], the military ruler of [[Xinjiang]] (Sinkiang, as it was spelled at the time), from 1933 to 1949. The book also includes archival material, for instance Sheng's interrogation and 1943 execution of [[Mao Zemin]], the brother of [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfnb|Whiting|1958| pp = vii, ix}}\n\nWhile studying in Taiwan in 1954, having heard that Sheng had come there with the Nationalist government after the communist victory on the mainland, Whiting inquired as to Sheng's whereabouts and was told that they were \"unknown.\" Whiting then met and interviewed Sheng extensively and edited his memoirs for this book. Whiting also interviewed Nationalist government officials who had dealt with Sheng, Stalin, and Xinjiang, as well as exploring archives in Taiwan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. He received helpful accounts of wartime diplomacy from [[O. Edmund Clubb]], who opened the first American consulate in Urumchi in 1943. Although he thanks [[Owen Lattimore]] in the Foreword for adding \"another dimension of understanding,\" Whiting explains that by titling the book \"pawn or pivot,\" he  wished to place a different emphasis from Lattimore's 1950 book ''Pivot of Asia'' and from those who saw the region as simply a pawn of the neighboring great powers. Taking the advice of a friend, he observed that in chess a \"pawn\" could also be a \"pivot.\"{{sfnb|Whiting|1958| pp = xvii}}\n\nSince Xinjiang was an important communication link between Moscow and the Chinese Communist Party headquarters in [[Yan'an]], Sheng's memoirs illuminate the sometimes angry relations between Stalin and Mao Zedong as well as Sheng's swing away from Moscow to ally with China.{{sfnb|Whiting|1958| pp = xiii}}\n\n=== ''China Crosses the Yalu'' (1960) ===\n\n''China Crosses the Yalu: the Decision to Enter the Korean War'' is a monograph based on research for the United States Air Force by the [[RAND Corporation]]. Whiting argues that China entered the [[Korean War]] reluctantly and to protect its border against a perceived American threat. This view became widely accepted at a time when many other observers saw the People's Republic as irrational and expansionist. William Stueck's 2002 review of scholarship on the Korean War concluded that in its \"broad outlines, Whiting's account remains plausible if hardly incontestable.\"<ref>{{cite journal\n|last =Stueck  |first =William |authorlink = |title =Revisionism and the Korean War |journal =  Journal of Conflict Studies|volume =22|issue = 1|pages = |publisher = |location = |date =2002 |language = |url =  http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/JCS/article/view/365/576 |jstor = |doi = |accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nIn 1990 two political scientists at Taiwan's [[National Chengchi University]] revisited the question of China's decision. They noted that \"Whiting's comprehensive study of China's decision to enter the war, and some of his inferences and conclusions, were closer to the truth than those of most other western analysts\"; considering the limited materials he had then from the Chinese side, \"probably no one could have done better than he did.\" But they also saw evidence that Whiting was \"deeply biased ideologically, and overlooked many important factors.\" He assumed that \"patron-client relations existed between Stalin and Mao, which \"limited the possibilities he could explore,\" rather than seeing that China's primary concern was for security in the face of a hostile power on their border.<ref>{{citation |title = China's Decision to Enter the Korean War: History Revisited | last = Hao |first = Yufan and Zhai Zhihai| journal = The China Quarterly | volume = 121 | year = 1990 |pp = 114\u2013115 |url = http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~lorenzo/Hao%20Chinas%20Decision.pdf |ref = harv}}</ref>\n\n=== Department of State in the 1960s ===\n\nWhiting was recruited from his position in the [[RAND Corporation]] in late 1961 and became head of the Far Eastern Division of the [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]].<ref name=\"Prados \" >John Prados (National Security Archive Fellow), \"[http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB121/prados.htm Introduction: The Mouse That Roared: State Department Intelligence in the Vietnam War],\" National Security Archives</ref>\n\nIn 1962, as the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] was breaking out, Whiting and his group correctly predicted that border clashes between [[India]] and [[China]] would escalate into the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962, and that China would initiate and then inflict a humiliating military defeat on America's ally, India. When [[President Kennedy]] then sent [[Averell Harriman]] to India to keep relations calm, Whiting and his group, including a specialist in Tibetan affairs, were dispatched with them. In the words of a National Security Archive history, Whiting's group \"embarrassed the U.S. military, and helped Harriman's mission, because their excellent maps ... were much better than anything the military had and formed the basis for policy discussions.\"<ref name=\"Prados \" />\n\nWhiting had responsibility for gathering and analyzing intelligence on the People's Republic of China at a time when there were no diplomatic relations and direct access was not possible but calculating China's intentions was important in making military decisions in the [[Vietnam war]]. In his memoirs, Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] complained that he was hampered in decision-making because there were no diplomats who were as familiar with China as those were who were familiar with [[Russia]]. Reviewers took exception to this claim. [[Roger Hilsman]], who had been assistant secretary of state in the [[Kennedy administration]], pointed to Whiting as just such a Chinese speaking expert. The problem, he said, was not that the department did not have such experts but that MacNamara would not listen to them.<ref>{{citation |first = Roger |last = Hilsman| title = McNamara's War -- Against the Truth: A Review Essay|journal = Political Science Quarterly| volume = 96|issue = 1| pp = 153\u2013 | ref = |jstor = 2151932|year = 1996}}</ref>\n\nHilsman's successor, [[Thomas L. Hughes]], wrote in his own review of McNamara's book that Whiting regularly briefed McNamara and Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]].<ref name=\"Hughes \">{{citation |first = Thomas L. |last = Hughes |title = Review of Robert McNamara, In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam (New York: Random House) |journal = Foreign Policy  |volume = 100 |issue = 100 |year = 1995 |pages = 154\u2013171 | ref= |jstor = 1149310 |doi = 10.2307/1149310 }}</ref> Whiting, said Hughes, warned [[Pentagon]] officials in August 1964 that North Vietnam would retaliate against American air bases after the bombings of Hanoi.<ref>For Whiting's retrospective view of this work see , [http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB121/inr03.pdf INR Estimates and the Vietnam War] Whiting to Hughes. February 10, 1969</ref> Whiting recommended that aircraft be moved to [[Thailand]] or provided with extra security. Neither action was taken and the planes suffered heavy damage when the bases were attacked.<ref name=\"Hughes \" /> Hughes also describes Whiting as \"a major influence on both Dean Rusk and [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]] in the 1960s as well as on [[Henry Kissinger]] and his opening to China in the 1970s.\"<ref>{{citation |first = Thomas L. |last = Hughes |title = Perilous Encounters: The Cold War Collisions Of Domestic And World Politics |year = 2012 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aT4tqznq6tYC|pages = 83 | ref= |isbn = 9781456889258 }}</ref>\n\nWhiting's State Department group was often at odds with the [[CIA]] and military, whose assessments of the intentions of China and the North Vietnamese often contended that the application of force, such as escalated bombing, would induce Hanoi to make concessions or come to the bargaining table. Whiting's group considered those views unrealistic and predicted that the Chinese would willing to take military action if pushed. Whiting later conceded that in the end the fear of Chinese intervention may have gone too far, although  Chinese intervention may have been prevented by the split in the leadership and China's turn inward at the outbreak of the [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1965. His State Department intelligence group then correctly predicted that China would limit itself to low risk support of North Vietnam, such as allowing use of air bases in southwest China. Whiting found on a trip to [[Vietnam]], however, that high level U.S. Navy intelligence estimates of Chinese capabilities did not include the existence of these airbases, which Whiting knew to exist. He was warned that some disgruntled fighter pilots identified him as a source of resistance to the air war and that he might be in danger of bodily harm.<ref name=\"Prados \" />\n\nAs the American involvement in Vietnam became deeper and more contentious, Whiting became a frequent adviser to [[George W. Ball]], then deputy under secretary of state, who President [[Lyndon Johnson]] consulted as a counterweight to more hawkish advisers, and also to Averell Harriman. But in 1966, when [[McGeorge Bundy]], Whiting's direct contact in the White House, was replaced by the more hawkish [[Walt Rostow]], Whiting accepted the position of deputy consul in the US consulate in [[Hong Kong].<ref name=\"Prados \" />\n\nIn 1968, he became professor of political science at University of Michigan, where he taught until 1982.<ref>[http://um2017.org/faculty-history/faculty/allen-s-whiting Allen S.

Asked to testify about the matter as an expert witness during the subsequent trial, Whiting testified that the disclosure of the Pentagon papers had not damaged the national defense, stating, \"I cannot see any way in which these [the Pentagon papers] would be of any advantage to a foreign national operating against the United States\"<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news |last=Arnold |first=Martin |date=March 15, 1973 |title=ELLSBERG JURORS BRIEFED ON SPYING |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/15/archives/ellsberg-jurors-briefed-on-spying-kissinger-consultant-tells-of.html |work=New York Times}}</ref> Under examination by [[Charles Nesson]], Whiting contested the assertions by [[Paul F. Gorman]] that the Pentagon Papers had hurt the United States' national defense by alerting the [[Soviet Union]] to the fact that their phones had been tapped at a summit in [[London]] in February 1967. Instead, Whiting testified that the Soviets had known the phones were tapped and intentionally discussed matters they wanted the British and American governments to intercept. Whiting concluded by stating, \"I see no way in which the material could be used to injure the United States.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> His characterization was later strongly disputed in court by [[Alexander Haig]], a top military advisor for President Nixon.<ref>{{cite news |last=Arnold |first=Martin |date=April 26, 1973 |title=HAIG IS A WITNESS IN ELLEN CASE |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/26/archives/haig-is-a-witness-in-ellsberg-case-general-an-aide-to-nixon-called.html?_r=0 |work=New York Times}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Chinese Calculus of Deterrence'' (1975) ===\n\n''The Chinese Calculus of Deterrence: India and Indochina'' compared two situations in which China's decision-makers moved to deter foreign powers.

Garver writing in 2005 noted that Whiting and the British journalist [[Neville Maxwell]] reached the same broad conclusion: \"China's resort to war in 1962 was largely a function of perceived Indian aggression.\" New China sources, Garver continued, made possible a \"testing\" of this \"Whiting-Maxwell thesis.\" While finding that the thesis was largely sound, Garver added that Mao's judgments about Indian motives were shaped by [[fundamental attribution error]], which finds that it is common to explain the motivation of others in terms of their character or culture while explaining one's own motivation by external necessity, and [[psychological projection]], that is, ascribing one's own suppressed aggression to others.{{sfnb|Garver|2006| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=DCihrQEdPzAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Whiting-Maxwell%20thesis&f=false 87]}}\n\nIn 2001, Whiting took advantage of new publications and archives to write an article reconsidering ''The Chinese Calculus of Deterrence''.

What emerges from Whiting's analysis, Klein continues, is the \"indelible point\" of the \"depth and fervor of China's historic memory of Japan's past predatory policies\" and the \"special intensity\" concerning the [[Nanjing Massacre]] of 1937. Although some Chinese officials admired Japan's economic success, Whiting's off-the-record interviews made clear that the feelings of enmity were serious and sincere.<ref>{{citation| first = Donald | last = Klein | title = Review \"China Eyes Japan\" | date = 1990 | journal = Journal of Asian Studies | volume = 49 | issue = 1  | pages = 146\u2013147 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=6988572&fileId=S0021911800101366 | ref = none | doi=10.2307/2058473| jstor = 2058473 }}</ref> Whiting concluded that \"the conventional cliche about a 'love-hate relationship' does not apply,\" for \"there is no 'love' on the Chinese side....\"{{sfnb|Whiting|1989| p = 198-199}}\n\n=== General assessment ===\n\nThe volume ''New Directions In The Study Of China\u2019s Foreign Policy'', edited by Alastair Iain Johnston and Robert S.

This understanding includes an emphasis on the role of historical legacies and the links between domestic political legitimacy. Whiting, they say, has taught a lesson: \"to try to see China and the world the way that influential Chinese see China and the world and you will be not only a much better scholar but a more effective advisor to those creating policy toward Beijing in the United States and elsewhere.

He graduated from [[Cornell University]] in 1948, earned a master's degree from [[Columbia University]] in 1950 and a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1952. After first joining the Department of Political Science at [[Michigan State University]], he became a researcher at the [[RAND Corporation]] and served in several capacities in the U.S. Department of State, including head of the Far Eastern Division of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research and deputy consul general in Hong Kong. He then taught at [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], 1968-1982. Whiting has been a member of the Board of Directors of the [[National Committee on United States-China Relations]], the [[Association for Asian Studies]], and the [[International Institute of Strategic Studies]].<ref>[http://www.worldlymind.org/whiting.pdf Allen S.

He graduated from [[Cornell University]] in 1948, where he studied with [[Knight Biggerstaff]] and gained master's degree at [[Columbia University]] in 1950. In 1952 he gained PhD at Columbia University.{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}}\n\n== Career and major works ==\nWhiting was instructor of political science at [[Northwestern University]] from 1951 to 1953, but his contract was not renewed when senior colleagues felt that his interest in the Soviet Union and China were politically suspicious. He was unemployed for a time, but received a [[Ford Foundation]] grant to study language in Taiwan. While there he contracted polio, whose effects afflicted him for the rest of his life.{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}}\nBetween 1955 and 1957 he was assistant professor at [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]]. From 1957 to 1961 he was a social scientist at the [[RAND Corporation]] in [[Santa Monica, California]].{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}} Between 1962 and 1966 he worked for the [[United States Department of State]] as Director of the Office of Research and Analysis for the Far East. From 1966 to 1966 he served as Deputy Consul General in [[Hong Kong]]. Whiting continued academic career as professor of political science at [[University Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], where he worked from 1968 to 1982.{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}} He was then professor at [[University Arizona]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] between 1982 and 1993, and from then a regents professor. He was a director of the Center for East Asian Studies from 1982 to 1993. Whiting also served as a consultant for the Department of State between 1968 and 1988 and director of the National Committee on the United States-China Relation in [[New York City]] from 1977 to 1994.{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}}\nHe was an associate of the China Council from 1978 to 1988. From 1983 to 1995 he was president of the Southern Arizona China Council in Tucson and a fellow of the [[Woodrow Wilson Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] from 1995 to 1996.{{sfnb|PollackShambaugh|2019}}\n\n=== ''Sinkiang:Pawn or Pivot?'' (1958) ===\n\n[[File:Governor Sheng Shicai.jpg|thumb|Governor of Xinjiang Sheng Shicai]]\n\nHis 1958 ''Sinkiang: Pawn or Pivot?'' includes Whiting's \"Soviet Strategy in Sinkiang: 1933-49\" (pp.&nbsp;3\u2013148), which analyzes the background and the international rivalry between Moscow and the Chinese central government in this period, and \"Red Failure in Sinkiang,\" the memoirs of [[Sheng Shicai]], the military ruler of [[Xinjiang]] (Sinkiang, as it was spelled at the time), from 1933 to 1949. The book also includes archival material, for instance Sheng's interrogation and 1943 execution of [[Mao Zemin]], the brother of [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfnb|Whiting|1958| pp = vii, ix}}\n\nWhile studying in Taiwan in 1954, having heard that Sheng had come there with the Nationalist government after the communist victory on the mainland, Whiting inquired as to Sheng's whereabouts and was told that they were \"unknown.\" Whiting then met and interviewed Sheng extensively and edited his memoirs for this book. Whiting also interviewed Nationalist government officials who had dealt with Sheng, Stalin, and Xinjiang, as well as exploring archives in Taiwan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. He received helpful accounts of wartime diplomacy from [[O. Edmund Clubb]], who opened the first American consulate in Urumchi in 1943. Although he thanks [[Owen Lattimore]] in the Foreword for adding \"another dimension of understanding,\" Whiting explains that by titling the book \"pawn or pivot,\" he  wished to place a different emphasis from Lattimore's 1950 book ''Pivot of Asia'' and from those who saw the region as simply a pawn of the neighboring great powers. Taking the advice of a friend, he observed that in chess a \"pawn\" could also be a \"pivot.\"{{sfnb|Whiting|1958| pp = xvii}}\n\nSince Xinjiang was an important communication link between Moscow and the Chinese Communist Party headquarters in [[Yan'an]], Sheng's memoirs illuminate the sometimes angry relations between Stalin and Mao Zedong as well as Sheng's swing away from Moscow to ally with China.{{sfnb|Whiting|1958| pp = xiii}}\n\n=== ''China Crosses the Yalu'' (1960) ===\n\n''China Crosses the Yalu: the Decision to Enter the Korean War'' is a monograph based on research for the United States Air Force by the [[RAND Corporation]]. Whiting argues that China entered the [[Korean War]] reluctantly and to protect its border against a perceived American threat. This view became widely accepted at a time when many other observers saw the People's Republic as irrational and expansionist. William Stueck's 2002 review of scholarship on the Korean War concluded that in its \"broad outlines, Whiting's account remains plausible if hardly incontestable.\"<ref>{{cite journal\n|last =Stueck  |first =William |authorlink = |title =Revisionism and the Korean War |journal =  Journal of Conflict Studies|volume =22|issue = 1|pages = |publisher = |location = |date =2002 |language = |url =  http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/JCS/article/view/365/576 |jstor = |doi = |accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nIn 1990 two political scientists at Taiwan's [[National Chengchi University]] revisited the question of China's decision. They noted that \"Whiting's comprehensive study of China's decision to enter the war, and some of his inferences and conclusions, were closer to the truth than those of most other western analysts\"; considering the limited materials he had then from the Chinese side, \"probably no one could have done better than he did.\" But they also saw evidence that Whiting was \"deeply biased ideologically, and overlooked many important factors.\" He assumed that \"patron-client relations existed between Stalin and Mao, which \"limited the possibilities he could explore,\" rather than seeing that China's primary concern was for security in the face of a hostile power on their border.<ref>{{citation |title = China's Decision to Enter the Korean War: History Revisited | last = Hao |first = Yufan and Zhai Zhihai| journal = The China Quarterly | volume = 121 | year = 1990 |pp = 114\u2013115 |url = http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~lorenzo/Hao%20Chinas%20Decision.pdf |ref = harv}}</ref>\n\n=== Department of State in the 1960s ===\n\nWhiting was recruited from his position in the [[RAND Corporation]] in late 1961 and became head of the Far Eastern Division of the [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]].<ref name=\"Prados \" >John Prados (National Security Archive Fellow), \"[http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB121/prados.htm Introduction: The Mouse That Roared: State Department Intelligence in the Vietnam War],\" National Security Archives</ref>\n\nIn 1962, as the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] was breaking out, Whiting and his group correctly predicted that border clashes between [[India]] and [[China]] would escalate into the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962, and that China would initiate and then inflict a humiliating military defeat on America's ally, India. When [[President Kennedy]] then sent [[Averell Harriman]] to India to keep relations calm, Whiting and his group, including a specialist in Tibetan affairs, were dispatched with them. In the words of a National Security Archive history, Whiting's group \"embarrassed the U.S. military, and helped Harriman's mission, because their excellent maps ... were much better than anything the military had and formed the basis for policy discussions.\"<ref name=\"Prados \" />\n\nWhiting had responsibility for gathering and analyzing intelligence on the People's Republic of China at a time when there were no diplomatic relations and direct access was not possible but calculating China's intentions was important in making military decisions in the [[Vietnam war]]. In his memoirs, Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] complained that he was hampered in decision-making because there were no diplomats who were as familiar with China as those were who were familiar with [[Russia]]. Reviewers took exception to this claim. [[Roger Hilsman]], who had been assistant secretary of state in the [[Kennedy administration]], pointed to Whiting as just such a Chinese speaking expert. The problem, he said, was not that the department did not have such experts but that MacNamara would not listen to them.<ref>{{citation |first = Roger |last = Hilsman| title = McNamara's War -- Against the Truth: A Review Essay|journal = Political Science Quarterly| volume = 96|issue = 1| pp = 153\u2013 | ref = |jstor = 2151932|year = 1996}}</ref>\n\nHilsman's successor, [[Thomas L.

Whiting's group considered those views unrealistic and predicted that the Chinese would willing to take military action if pushed. Whiting later conceded that in the end the fear of Chinese intervention may have gone too far, although  Chinese intervention may have been prevented by the split in the leadership and China's turn inward at the outbreak of the [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1965. His State Department intelligence group then correctly predicted that China would limit itself to low risk support of North Vietnam, such as allowing use of air bases in southwest China. Whiting found on a trip to [[Vietnam]], however, that high level U.S. Navy intelligence estimates of Chinese capabilities did not include the existence of these airbases, which Whiting knew to exist. He was warned that some disgruntled fighter pilots identified him as a source of resistance to the air war and that he might be in danger of bodily harm.<ref name=\"Prados \" />\n\nAs the American involvement in Vietnam became deeper and more contentious, Whiting became a frequent adviser to [[George W. Ball]], then deputy under secretary of state, who President [[Lyndon Johnson]] consulted as a counterweight to more hawkish advisers, and also to Averell Harriman. But in 1966, when [[McGeorge Bundy]], Whiting's direct contact in the White House, was replaced by the more hawkish [[Walt Rostow]], Whiting accepted the position of deputy consul in the US consulate in [[Hong Kong].<ref name=\"Prados \" />\n\nIn 1968, he became professor of political science at University of Michigan, where he taught until 1982.<ref>[http://um2017.org/faculty-history/faculty/allen-s-whiting Allen S.

Asked to testify about the matter as an expert witness during the subsequent trial, Whiting testified that the disclosure of the Pentagon papers had not damaged the national defense, stating, \"I cannot see any way in which these [the Pentagon papers] would be of any advantage to a foreign national operating against the United States\"<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news |last=Arnold |first=Martin |date=March 15, 1973 |title=ELLSBERG JURORS BRIEFED ON SPYING |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/15/archives/ellsberg-jurors-briefed-on-spying-kissinger-consultant-tells-of.html |work=New York Times}}</ref> Under examination by [[Charles Nesson]], Whiting contested the assertions by [[Paul F.

Instead, Whiting testified that the Soviets had known the phones were tapped and intentionally discussed matters they wanted the British and American governments to intercept.

What emerges from Whiting's analysis, Klein continues, is the \"indelible point\" of the \"depth and fervor of China's historic memory of Japan's past predatory policies\" and the \"special intensity\" concerning the [[Nanjing Massacre]] of 1937. Although some Chinese officials admired Japan's economic success, Whiting's off-the-record interviews made clear that the feelings of enmity were serious and sincere.<ref>{{citation| first = Donald | last = Klein | title = Review \"China Eyes Japan\" | date = 1990 | journal = Journal of Asian Studies | volume = 49 | issue = 1  | pages = 146\u2013147 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=6988572&fileId=S0021911800101366 | ref = none | doi=10.2307/2058473| jstor = 2058473 }}</ref> Whiting concluded that \"the conventional cliche about a 'love-hate relationship' does not apply,\" for \"there is no 'love' on the Chinese side....\"{{sfnb|Whiting|1989| p = 198-199}}\n\n=== General assessment ===\n\nThe volume ''New Directions In The Study Of China\u2019s Foreign Policy'', edited by Alastair Iain Johnston and Robert S. Ross,  grew out of a December 2002 conference held in Whiting's honor at Harvard University.<ref>Richard Desjardins,\n[http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo8/no1/book-livre-02-eng.asp ''Canadian Military Journal'' 8.1] (archived)</ref> Chapters in the volume revisit Whiting's books in order to reconsider the arguments in light of new evidence.The editors note in their concluding remarks that Whiting has \"long argued that China\u2019s government pursues its international goals with basic rationality,\" even those \"ideologically fundamentalist actors, like Mao himself.\" They add that \"rationality\" is conditioned by \"perceptions and misconceptions\" held both by China's foreign policy elites and the elites of other countries. This understanding includes an emphasis on the role of historical legacies and the links between domestic political legitimacy. Whiting, they say, has taught a lesson: \"to try to see China and the world the way that influential Chinese see China and the world and you will be not only a much better scholar but a more effective advisor to those creating policy toward Beijing in the United States and elsewhere. [[Empathy]], not [[sympathy]], is critical.\"{{sfnb|Johnston|2006 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=DCihrQEdPzAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=cautiously%20optimistic&f=false 379-380]}}\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n* {{cite book |last = Whiting, Allen S.  |year = 1954 |title = Soviet Policies in China, 1917-1924 |publisher = Columbia University Press| location = New York |isbn = |ref = }} [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015001858904 Hathi Trust] (search only).\n* {{cite book |last = Haas, Ernst Bernard and Allen S.

It was the band's last for [[Casablanca Records]], the only label for which Kiss had recorded up to that point. The album was dedicated to the memory of Casablanca founder and early Kiss supporter [[Neil Bogart]],<ref>[[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] \u2013 Creatures of the Night [http://www.kissmonster.com/discography/cover_creatures82_large_rear.jpg back album cover]. ''[[Casablanca Records]]''. Retrieved April 8, 2012.</ref> who had died of cancer during the recording sessions. It is also the band's last album recorded with [[Ace Frehley]] credited as an official member and their first album with [[Vinnie Vincent]] as the initially-uncredited [[lead guitar]]ist (Vincent would later be credited but not featured on the cover of the 1985 reissue of the album). It was also Kiss' last album to feature the band with their trademark makeup until the 1998 release, ''[[Psycho Circus]]''.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe album represented a conscious effort by Kiss to return to the [[hard rock]] style that had helped them achieve commercial success with ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' and ''[[Love Gun]]''. Their pop-oriented albums ''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'' and ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'' had started a decline in popularity that reached rock bottom with 1981's ''[[Music from \"The Elder\"]]''. By 1982, Kiss knew it needed to deliver on their earlier 1980\u201381 promise of a heavy record.\n\nThe first key ingredient was songwriter/guitarist Vinnie Vincent, who was soon to replace Ace Frehley as the band's new lead guitarist after being introduced to the band by album co-writer [[Adam Mitchell (songwriter)|Adam Mitchell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kissasylum.com/vault/issue9.html|title=KISS Asylum: KISS Thought Vault: Issue #9|website=www.kissasylum.com|accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref> Though Frehley did not play on the album, his face was still featured on the album cover for contractual and commercial reasons. Frehley had been pushing the band to do a heavy rock record since'' Dynasty'', and by the time of ''Creatures of the Night'' he was fully disillusioned with the band, and that combined with [[alcoholism]] and a prescription medicine dependency (begun after a car wreck) led to his leaving the band during the recording sessions. On the tour, Vincent was introduced with his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Ankh]] make-up, designed in a hurry by [[Paul Stanley]]. In 1985, Kiss [[re-release]]d the album in their non-make-up state with a cover featuring [[Gene Simmons]], Stanley, [[Eric Carr]] and then-current guitarist [[Bruce Kulick]] (even though Kulick did not play on the album). Vinnie Vincent had long since departed the band (being twice fired) by 1985.\n\nBy 1982, Kiss's popularity in the US had plummeted due to changing music tastes and their near abandonment of hard rock. 1979's ''Dynasty'', while commercially successful, alienated many fans with the [[disco]]-flavored track \"[[I Was Made For Lovin' You]]\". 1980's ''Unmasked'' fell further into pop music\u2014and was Kiss's first album not to achieve platinum status since 1975's ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]''. The band did not even tour the US for ''Unmasked'', and it was also soon faced with its first lineup change: founding member [[Peter Criss]], who had not participated in any of the ''Unmasked'' recording sessions, officially left Kiss in 1980. He was replaced by Eric Carr.\n\nFan hopes were raised in late 1980 when Kiss announced that they were going to record their heaviest record yet. Instead, the band released ''Music from \"The Elder\"'' in late 1981, a [[concept album]] originally intended to complement a film called ''The Elder'' that was ultimately never filmed. The album was [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]]-based and had [[ballads]], a short [[orchestral]] piece, and different lyrical themes. The album failed to achieve gold status, and having cancelled their US [[Unmasked Tour]] just a short time before, the band then called off the planned tour for ''Music from \"The Elder\"''. Frehley soon left the band.\n\nKiss's label situation had changed as well. Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart had sold the label to its distributor PolyGram, and went on to briefly form The Boardwalk Recording Company before being diagnosed with and later succumbing to cancer. Using a clause in their Casablanca contract that gave the band an option to leave the label if Bogart did, Kiss became free agents and signed a multimillion-dollar deal with [[Mercury Records]]. Mercury, a label also owned by PolyGram, reverted the band to their \"old\" label, though in name only.\n\n==Recording==\n\nWhen recording sessions for ''Creatures of the Night'' began in July 1982, Kiss was essentially a trio. Frehley still made appearances with the band but had nearly ended his musical involvement with Kiss. Frehley looked completely out of sorts in promotional appearances for the album; in cases where the band was lip syncing to recorded tracks, he did not know the material. It was only after the album was released and a short promotional tour of [[Europe]] was completed that Frehley officially left Kiss. The lead guitar replacement for Frehley for the [[Creatures of the Night Tour/10th Anniversary Tour]] in the US was Vinnie Vincent, who adopted the Ankh make-up.\n\nMusically, the progressive rock of ''Music From \"The Elder\"'' and the pop of ''Dynasty'' and ''Unmasked'' were completely absent from ''Creatures of the Night'', making it the heaviest album the group had made at that point.<ref>''MusicMight'' [http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/new+york/new+york+city/kiss Kiss biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420021246/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/new+york/new+york+city/kiss |date=April 20, 2016 }}. Retrieved April 8, 2012.</ref> \"I Still Love You\", the only ballad on ''Creatures of the Night'', was still heavier and darker than any ballad Kiss had released in earlier years. Also contributing to the heavy sound was Carr's drumming style, which was more similar to [[John Bonham]]'s drumming than to Criss' jazz-influenced style.<ref>Rubin, Jon [http://www.kissrocks.net/kissrocks_ericcarrinterview.html KISS Rocks' Exclusive 1989 Interview with Eric Carr]. ''kissrocks.com''. Retrieved April 8, 2012.</ref> Some of the earliest pressings of the album mistakenly contained one full side of [[John Cougar]]'s ''[[American Fool]]''. Both Kiss and Cougar were under the umbrella of Mercury Records at the time.\n\n''Creatures of the Night'' is the first Kiss album to have all lead vocal duties handled by either Simmons or Stanley exclusively. All previous studio releases by the group contained at least one song with lead vocals by another band member. The band released a video for \"[[I Love It Loud]]\", which received moderate airplay on [[MTV]]. In it was a stage setup that featured Carr's [[drum kit]] as a giant metallic tank with an exploding turret. Flames and explosions were also in abundance, as Kiss attempted to produce a video that reflected the music on ''Creatures of the Night''. Frehley did appear in the video as the rhythm guitarist, with Stanley shown playing the seven-note solo.\n\nThough Kiss had used \"ghost players\" on previous albums, most notably [[Bob Kulick]] (''[[Alive II]]'' and ''[[Killers (Kiss album)|Killers]]'') and [[Dick Wagner]] (''Destroyer)'', Vinnie Vincent handled most of the lead guitar as a session player and co-writer before being added as the full-time replacement for Frehley, though as an employee and not a full member (like Carr). Blues guitarist [[Robben Ford]], a friend of the album's producer Michael James Jackson, contributed two solos in what he described as one of his weirdest gigs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiss-related-recordings.nl/news_201301.html|title=KISS Related Recordings ;News update January 2013|website=www.kiss-related-recordings.nl|accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref> [[Mr. Mister]] guitarist Steve Farris (who was considered as a replacement for Frehley but was thought to not have \"the right look\") provided the solo and lead fills to the title track.

However, the Creatures Tour proved to be a bigger failure than the last North American tour in 1979. Kiss played to numerous half-empty arenas on the tour, including venues that the band had sold out or at least played to near-full capacity four years earlier on the [[Dynasty Tour]] and shows canceled due to insufficient ticket sales. Despite this, the favourable fan perception of the album has ensured that \"War Machine\", \"I Love It Loud\", and \"Creatures of the Night\" remain Kiss concert staples to this day.

It was the band's last for [[Casablanca Records]], the only label for which Kiss had recorded up to that point. The album was dedicated to the memory of Casablanca founder and early Kiss supporter [[Neil Bogart]],<ref>[[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] \u2013 Creatures of the Night [http://www.kissmonster.com/discography/cover_creatures82_large_rear.jpg back album cover]. ''[[Casablanca Records]]''. Retrieved April 8, 2012.</ref> who had died of cancer during the recording sessions. It is also the band's last album recorded with [[Ace Frehley]] credited as an official member and their first album with [[Vinnie Vincent]] as the initially-uncredited [[lead guitar]]ist (Vincent would later be credited but not featured on the cover of the 1985 reissue of the album). It was also Kiss' last album to feature the band with their trademark makeup until the 1998 release, ''[[Psycho Circus]]''.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe album represented a conscious effort by Kiss to return to the [[hard rock]] style that had helped them achieve commercial success with ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' and ''[[Love Gun]]''. Their pop-oriented albums ''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'' and ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'' had started a decline in popularity that reached rock bottom with 1981's ''[[Music from \"The Elder\"]]''. By 1982, Kiss knew it needed to deliver on their earlier 1980\u201381 promise of a heavy record.\n\nThe first key ingredient was songwriter/guitarist Vinnie Vincent, who was soon to replace Ace Frehley as the band's new lead guitarist after being introduced to the band by album co-writer [[Adam Mitchell (songwriter)|Adam Mitchell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kissasylum.com/vault/issue9.html|title=KISS Asylum: KISS Thought Vault: Issue #9|website=www.kissasylum.com|accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref> Though Frehley did not play on the album, his face was still featured on the album cover for contractual and commercial reasons. Frehley had been pushing the band to do a heavy rock record since'' Dynasty'', and by the time of ''Creatures of the Night'' he was fully disillusioned with the band, and that combined with [[alcoholism]] and a prescription medicine dependency (begun after a car wreck) led to his leaving the band during the recording sessions. On the tour, Vincent was introduced with his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Ankh]] make-up, designed in a hurry by [[Paul Stanley]]. In 1985, Kiss [[re-release]]d the album in their non-make-up state with a cover featuring [[Gene Simmons]], Stanley, [[Eric Carr]] and then-current guitarist [[Bruce Kulick]] (even though Kulick did not play on the album). Vinnie Vincent had long since departed the band (being twice fired) by 1985.\n\nBy 1982, Kiss's popularity in the US had plummeted due to changing music tastes and their near abandonment of hard rock. 1979's ''Dynasty'', while commercially successful, alienated many fans with the [[disco]]-flavored track \"[[I Was Made For Lovin' You]]\". 1980's ''Unmasked'' fell further into pop music\u2014and was Kiss's first album not to achieve platinum status since 1975's ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]''. The band did not even tour the US for ''Unmasked'', and it was also soon faced with its first lineup change: founding member [[Peter Criss]], who had not participated in any of the ''Unmasked'' recording sessions, officially left Kiss in 1980. He was replaced by Eric Carr.\n\nFan hopes were raised in late 1980 when Kiss announced that they were going to record their heaviest record yet. Instead, the band released ''Music from \"The Elder\"'' in late 1981, a [[concept album]] originally intended to complement a film called ''The Elder'' that was ultimately never filmed. The album was [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]]-based and had [[ballads]], a short [[orchestral]] piece, and different lyrical themes. The album failed to achieve gold status, and having cancelled their US [[Unmasked Tour]] just a short time before, the band then called off the planned tour for ''Music from \"The Elder\"''. Frehley soon left the band.\n\nKiss's label situation had changed as well. Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart had sold the label to its distributor PolyGram, and went on to briefly form The Boardwalk Recording Company before being diagnosed with and later succumbing to cancer. Using a clause in their Casablanca contract that gave the band an option to leave the label if Bogart did, Kiss became free agents and signed a multimillion-dollar deal with [[Mercury Records]]. Mercury, a label also owned by PolyGram, reverted the band to their \"old\" label, though in name only.\n\n==Recording==\n\nWhen recording sessions for ''Creatures of the Night'' began in July 1982, Kiss was essentially a trio. Frehley still made appearances with the band but had nearly ended his musical involvement with Kiss. Frehley looked completely out of sorts in promotional appearances for the album; in cases where the band was lip syncing to recorded tracks, he did not know the material. It was only after the album was released and a short promotional tour of [[Europe]] was completed that Frehley officially left Kiss. The lead guitar replacement for Frehley for the [[Creatures of the Night Tour/10th Anniversary Tour]] in the US was Vinnie Vincent, who adopted the Ankh make-up.\n\nMusically, the progressive rock of ''Music From \"The Elder\"'' and the pop of ''Dynasty'' and ''Unmasked'' were completely absent from ''Creatures of the Night'', making it the heaviest album the group had made at that point.<ref>''MusicMight'' [http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/new+york/new+york+city/kiss Kiss biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420021246/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/new+york/new+york+city/kiss |date=April 20, 2016 }}. Retrieved April 8, 2012.</ref> \"I Still Love You\", the only ballad on ''Creatures of the Night'', was still heavier and darker than any ballad Kiss had released in earlier years.

''kissrocks.com''. Retrieved April 8, 2012.</ref> Some of the earliest pressings of the album mistakenly contained one full side of [[John Cougar]]'s ''[[American Fool]]''. Both Kiss and Cougar were under the umbrella of Mercury Records at the time.\n\n''Creatures of the Night'' is the first Kiss album to have all lead vocal duties handled by either Simmons or Stanley exclusively. All previous studio releases by the group contained at least one song with lead vocals by another band member. The band released a video for \"[[I Love It Loud]]\", which received moderate airplay on [[MTV]]. In it was a stage setup that featured Carr's [[drum kit]] as a giant metallic tank with an exploding turret. Flames and explosions were also in abundance, as Kiss attempted to produce a video that reflected the music on ''Creatures of the Night''. Frehley did appear in the video as the rhythm guitarist, with Stanley shown playing the seven-note solo.\n\nThough Kiss had used \"ghost players\" on previous albums, most notably [[Bob Kulick]] (''[[Alive II]]'' and ''[[Killers (Kiss album)|Killers]]'') and [[Dick Wagner]] (''Destroyer)'', Vinnie Vincent handled most of the lead guitar as a session player and co-writer before being added as the full-time replacement for Frehley, though as an employee and not a full member (like Carr). Blues guitarist [[Robben Ford]], a friend of the album's producer Michael James Jackson, contributed two solos in what he described as one of his weirdest gigs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiss-related-recordings.nl/news_201301.html|title=KISS Related Recordings ;News update January 2013|website=www.kiss-related-recordings.nl|accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref> [[Mr. Mister]] guitarist Steve Farris (who was considered as a replacement for Frehley but was thought to not have \"the right look\") provided the solo and lead fills to the title track.

On the 1985 non-make-up release, the song \"Creatures of the Night\" is remixed, and \"Saint and Sinner\" and \"Killer\" are interchanged from side to side with each other.

However, the Creatures Tour proved to be a bigger failure than the last North American tour in 1979. Kiss played to numerous half-empty arenas on the tour, including venues that the band had sold out or at least played to near-full capacity four years earlier on the [[Dynasty Tour]] and shows canceled due to insufficient ticket sales. Despite this, the favourable fan perception of the album has ensured that \"War Machine\", \"I Love It Loud\", and \"Creatures of the Night\" remain Kiss concert staples to this day. Live versions of \"Creatures\" and \"I Love It Loud\" were included on [[Alive III]].\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = Lead vocals\n| headline        = Side one\n| title1          = [[Creatures of the Night (Kiss song)|Creatures of the Night]]\n| writer1         = [[Paul Stanley]], [[Adam Mitchell (songwriter)|Adam Mitchell]]\n| extra1          = Stanley\n| length1         = 4:02\n| title2          = Saint and Sinner\n| writer2         = [[Gene Simmons]], [[Mikel Japp]]\n| extra2          = Simmons\n| length2         = 4:50\n| title3          = Keep Me Comin'\n| writer3         = Stanley, Mitchell\n| extra3          = Stanley\n| length3         = 3:55\n| title4          = Rock and Roll Hell\n| writer4         = Simmons, [[Bryan Adams]], [[Jim Vallance]]\n| extra4          = Simmons\n| length4         = 4:11\n| title5          = Danger\n| writer5         = Stanley, Mitchell\n| extra5          = Stanley\n| length5         = 3:54\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| extra_column    = Lead vocals\n| headline        = Side two\n| title6          = [[I Love It Loud]]\n| writer6         = Simmons, [[Vinnie Vincent]]\n| extra6          = Simmons\n| length6         = 4:15\n| title7          = I Still Love You\n| writer7         = Stanley, Vincent\n| extra7          = Stanley\n| length7         = 6:06\n| title8          = [[Killer (Kiss song)|Killer]]\n| writer8         = Simmons, Vincent\n| extra8          = Simmons\n| length8         = 3:19\n| title9          = War Machine\n| writer9         = Simmons, Adams, Vallance\n| extra9          = Simmons\n| length9         = 4:14\n}}\n\n*'''Note''': On the 1985 re-release of the album tracks 2 and 8 were switched.

Written by [[Roberta Williams]] and [[Jane Jensen]], ''King's Quest VI'' is widely recognized as the high point in the series for its landmark 3D graphic introduction movie (created by [[Kronos Digital Entertainment]]) and professional voice acting (Hollywood actor [[Robby Benson]] provided the voice for Prince Alexander, the game's protagonist). ''King's Quest VI'' was programmed in [[Sierra Entertainment#1980s|Sierra's Creative Interpreter]] and was the last ''King's Quest'' game to be released on [[floppy disk]]. A [[CD-ROM]] version of the game was released in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]], including more character voices, a slightly different opening movie and more detailed artwork and animation.\n\nThe name of this sequel is a pun on the common phrase \"here today, gone tomorrow\". This pun is related to the abrupt departure of Prince Alexander after the events of ''[[King's Quest V]]'', where he was just rescued by King Graham along with Princess Cassima, who asked Alexander to come visit her at the end of that game. ''[[King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human]]'' also contained the word \"heir\" in its title and also featured Prince Alexander (then known as the slave Gwydion) as the main character.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:KQ6 CD bookstore.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot from the Windows version displaying the interface of the functions toolbar and inventory; on the left is the player character Prince Alexander]]\n''King's Quest VI'' is a 2D [[graphic adventure]] game with a [[point-and-click]] interface. The player is given an icon-based toolbar at the top of the screen of selectable functions: walk, look (provides a description from the narrator of the object targeted), action and talk, respectively. It also includes the item inventory (the last selected item can be picked right away) and a game options menu. This is the second game in the series to feature this interface, which was introduced in its immediate predecessor ''[[King's Quest V]]'' as a new feature of the SCI1 version of [[Sierra's Creative Interpreter]] engine; previous titles in the series featured a [[text parser]] where players had to type commands and actions instead of selecting them on the screen.<ref name=\"ACG\" />\n\nGameplay involves solving puzzles. Those include logic puzzles and interacting with characters either by dialogue or usage of collected items.<ref name=\"AGR\" /> One of the puzzles requires consulting the booklet \"Guidebook to the Land of the Green Isles\", which is included in the game's package.<ref name=\"AGR\" /><ref name=\"guidebook\" /> Aside from providing additional background to the game's setting, this booklet serves as part of the game's [[copy-protection]]. The player will not be able to pass the puzzles on the Cliffs of Logic that guard the Isle of the Sacred Mountain without information from the booklet.

Although a magic map had been used in earlier games of the series such as ''[[King's Quest III]]'', its implementation in ''King's Quest VI'' was different from earlier games in that it was only used for travel between islands, which could not be reached using the walking interface.<ref>[http://www.oocities.org/petter_holmberg/kq6review.html ''King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow'' review]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe game takes place almost entirely in a fictional kingdom called the Land of the Green Isles.

The Isle of the Beast, inspired by [[Beauty And The Beast]], is heavily forested and scattered with magical barriers.

After seeing a vision of Cassima in the magical mirror that his father acquired in the first ''[[King's Quest]]'', he sails to find her. At the beginning of the game he is shipwrecked on the shore of the Isle of the Crown, where he learns that the [[vizier]] [[Abdul Alhazred]] (named after the author of the fictional [[Necronomicon]]) has assumed control in Cassima's absence, and plans to force her to marry him.

Upon completing either path, the player is given a clue about what choices would have led to the other ending. In addition to the two main paths and endings, the game's endings also contain many minor variables based on optional tasks in the game that the player may or may not have performed.<ref name=\"AGR\" /> Almost half of the game's quests are optional, many have multiple solutions, and because of the game's [[open world]] design players can solve most in any order.{{r|miller199301}}\n\n==Cast==\n* '''[[Robby Benson]]''' - Prince Alexander\n* '''[[Stevie Vallance]]''' (credited as Louise Vallance) - Princess Cassima\n* '''[[Bill Ratner]]''' - Narrator\n* '''[[Townsend Coleman]]''' - Vizier Abdul Alhazred / Shamir Shamazel / Lord Azure / Ferryman / Beast / Minotaur\n* '''[[Tony Jay]]''' - Captain Saladin / Gate / Arch Druid / Lamp Trader\n* '''Sheryl Bernstein''' - Queen Valanice / Princess Rosella / Lady Aeriel / White Chess Queen / Black Widow\n* '''[[Ron Feinberg]]''' - King Caliphim / Lord of the Dead / Gruff\n* '''[[Dave Fennoy]]''' (credited as David Fennoy) - Pawnshop Owner\n* '''[[Don Messick]]''' - Ali / Gnomes\n* '''[[Neil Ross]]''' - Chess Knights \n* '''[[Russi Taylor]]''' - Beauty / Lady Celeste / Ghost Child / Oyster \n* '''[[Linda Gary]]''' (credited as Linda Grey) - Oracle / Red Chess Queen / Mother Ghost / Queen Allaria\n* '''[[Josh Mandel (video game designer)|Josh Mandel]]''' - King Graham / Shamir Shamazel / Oxymoron / Druid / Guard Dog\n* '''[[Chuck McCann]]''' - Jollo / Bookworm / Bump-on-a-Log / Woof \n* '''[[Patrick Pinney]]''' - Winged One / Diphthong\n* '''David Prince''' - Dangling Participle / Stick-in-the-mud\n\n==Development==\n''King's Quest'' creator and designer [[Roberta Williams]] first met with [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]] newcomer and co-designer [[Jane Jensen]] (who would go on to create the ''[[Gabriel Knight]]'' series)<ref name=\"ACG\">{{cite web|last1=Hagerup|first1=Eivind|title=King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow|url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/63/|publisher=Adventure Classic Gaming|accessdate=4 April 2017|date=20 April 1998}}</ref> in May 1991 to discuss the design for the upcoming sixth title in the series.{{sfn|Shannon|1992|p=2}} Williams began preliminary work on ''King's Quest VI'' in June, \"laying out the basic story\"<ref name=\"IAV5N3\">{{cite journal|last1=DeBaun|first1=Rich|title=The Quest for King's Quest VI|journal=InterAction Magazine|date=Fall 1992|volume=5|issue=3|pages=20\u201326|url=http://www.sierragamers.com/uploads/24082/Interaction/015_InterAction_Volume_5_Number_3_Fall_1992.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2017|publisher=[[Sierra On-Line]]}}</ref> and worked alongside Jensen throughout July and August on coming up with design ideas; after five months, Williams and Jensen finished the documentation for the design.{{sfn|Shannon|1992|p=2}}<ref name=\"IAV5N3\" /><ref name=\"EG\">{{cite journal|last1=Ceccola|first1=Russ|title=All about King's Quest VI: EG learns the inside scoop from Roberta Williams and Jane Jensen|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|date=February 1993|volume=1|issue=5|pages=84, 85}}</ref> Two key goals of the writers were to keep the game's tone consistent with its predecessors' while still making it a distinct title, and to make players connect emotionally with the game; Williams wrote the love story of Prince Alexander and Cassima specifically for this emotional attachment.<ref name=\"IAV5N3\" />\n\n[[File:Making of KQ6.png|thumb|left|Crew filming real-life actors for [[motion capture]] in a behind-the-scenes footage of ''King's Quest VI''.]]\nCo-director and project manager Bill Skirvin and the artists created the storyboards and character sketches.

Written by [[Roberta Williams]] and [[Jane Jensen]], ''King's Quest VI'' is widely recognized as the high point in the series for its landmark 3D graphic introduction movie (created by [[Kronos Digital Entertainment]]) and professional voice acting (Hollywood actor [[Robby Benson]] provided the voice for Prince Alexander, the game's protagonist). ''King's Quest VI'' was programmed in [[Sierra Entertainment#1980s|Sierra's Creative Interpreter]] and was the last ''King's Quest'' game to be released on [[floppy disk]]. A [[CD-ROM]] version of the game was released in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]], including more character voices, a slightly different opening movie and more detailed artwork and animation.\n\nThe name of this sequel is a pun on the common phrase \"here today, gone tomorrow\". This pun is related to the abrupt departure of Prince Alexander after the events of ''[[King's Quest V]]'', where he was just rescued by King Graham along with Princess Cassima, who asked Alexander to come visit her at the end of that game. ''[[King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human]]'' also contained the word \"heir\" in its title and also featured Prince Alexander (then known as the slave Gwydion) as the main character.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:KQ6 CD bookstore.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot from the Windows version displaying the interface of the functions toolbar and inventory; on the left is the player character Prince Alexander]]\n''King's Quest VI'' is a 2D [[graphic adventure]] game with a [[point-and-click]] interface. The player is given an icon-based toolbar at the top of the screen of selectable functions: walk, look (provides a description from the narrator of the object targeted), action and talk, respectively. It also includes the item inventory (the last selected item can be picked right away) and a game options menu. This is the second game in the series to feature this interface, which was introduced in its immediate predecessor ''[[King's Quest V]]'' as a new feature of the SCI1 version of [[Sierra's Creative Interpreter]] engine; previous titles in the series featured a [[text parser]] where players had to type commands and actions instead of selecting them on the screen.<ref name=\"ACG\" />\n\nGameplay involves solving puzzles. Those include logic puzzles and interacting with characters either by dialogue or usage of collected items.<ref name=\"AGR\" /> One of the puzzles requires consulting the booklet \"Guidebook to the Land of the Green Isles\", which is included in the game's package.<ref name=\"AGR\" /><ref name=\"guidebook\" /> Aside from providing additional background to the game's setting, this booklet serves as part of the game's [[copy-protection]]. The player will not be able to pass the puzzles on the Cliffs of Logic that guard the Isle of the Sacred Mountain without information from the booklet. The booklet also includes a poem encoding the solution to one of the puzzles in the labyrinth on the island. In the re-released edition, the guide is part of the manual released on the game CD.<ref name=\"Game nostalgia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.game-nostalgia.com/sierra/kings_quest_series/kings_quest6_1.html|title=1992 \u2013 ''King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow''|website=Game Nostalgia}}</ref>\n\nSolving the puzzles in the game usually requires traveling between the islands that make up the game world, which is accomplished by means of a magic map. Although a magic map had been used in earlier games of the series such as ''[[King's Quest III]]'', its implementation in ''King's Quest VI'' was different from earlier games in that it was only used for travel between islands, which could not be reached using the walking interface.<ref>[http://www.oocities.org/petter_holmberg/kq6review.html ''King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow'' review]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe game takes place almost entirely in a fictional kingdom called the Land of the Green Isles. The kingdom comprises several islands, and is described as being largely isolated from the outside world.<ref name=\"guidebook\">{{cite book|last=Jenson|first=Jane|title=Guidebook to the Land of the Green Isles|publisher=Sierra On-Line|date=1992|url=http://www.sierrahelp.com/Documents/Misc/Kings_Quest_VI_-_Guidebook_to_the_Land_of_the_Green_Isles.pdf|accessdate=6 July 2014}}</ref> The player can travel between different islands after obtaining a magic map.<ref name=\"ACG\" />\n\nThe center of the kingdom is the Isle of the Crown, which has an [[Arabian Nights]] theme. The Isle of Wonder is inspired by [[Alice in Wonderland]], and the Isle of the Sacred Mountain is inspired by [[Classical mythology]]. The Isle of the Beast, inspired by [[Beauty And The Beast]], is heavily forested and scattered with magical barriers. There also are additional hidden areas.<ref name=\"AGR\" /> One of these is inhabited by a tribe of [[druids]], while another gives the player the option to confront [[Death (personification)|Death]].<ref name=\"Gamespot\">{{cite web|last=Gouskos|first=Carrie|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6144989/index.html|title=The Greatest Games of All Time: ''King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow''|website=[[GameSpot]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410142928/http://www.gamespot.com/features/6144989/index.html | archivedate=April 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe game's opening cutscene shows Prince Alexander haunted by his memories of Princess Cassima, who he met at the end of ''[[King's Quest V]]'' when they were both rescued from the wizard Mordack. After seeing a vision of Cassima in the magical mirror that his father acquired in the first ''[[King's Quest]]'', he sails to find her. At the beginning of the game he is shipwrecked on the shore of the Isle of the Crown, where he learns that the [[vizier]] [[Abdul Alhazred]] (named after the author of the fictional [[Necronomicon]]) has assumed control in Cassima's absence, and plans to force her to marry him. Alexander must explore the Land of the Green Isles in order to find and learn what he needs to rescue Cassima from the vizier.<ref name=\"COMPUTE\">{{cite journal|first=Scott A.|last=May|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue152/88_Kings_Quest_VI_Hei.php|title=''King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow''|journal=[[Compute]]!|publisher=[[ABC Publishing]]|issue=152|pages=88\u201389|date=May 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Multiple endings===\nA significant aspect of ''KQ6''{{'s}} story and gameplay is the option for the player to receive different endings based on choices made during the course of the game. Partway through the game, the player has the option to pursue either the \"short path\", which finishes the game rather quickly, or the \"long path\", which contains more puzzles and leads to a more satisfying ending. Upon completing either path, the player is given a clue about what choices would have led to the other ending. In addition to the two main paths and endings, the game's endings also contain many minor variables based on optional tasks in the game that the player may or may not have performed.<ref name=\"AGR\" /> Almost half of the game's quests are optional, many have multiple solutions, and because of the game's [[open world]] design players can solve most in any order.{{r|miller199301}}\n\n===Cast===\n* '''[[Robby Benson]]''' - Prince Alexander\n* '''[[Stevie Vallance]]''' (credited as Louise Vallance) - Princess Cassima\n* '''[[Bill Ratner]]''' - Narrator\n* '''[[Townsend Coleman]]''' - Vizier Abdul Alhazred / Shamir Shamazel / Lord Azure / Ferryman / Beast / Minotaur\n* '''[[Tony Jay]]''' - Captain Saladin / Gate / Arch Druid / Lamp Trader\n* '''Sheryl Bernstein''' - Queen Valanice / Princess Rosella / Lady Aeriel / White Chess Queen / Black Widow\n* '''[[Ron Feinberg]]''' - King Caliphim / Lord of the Dead / Gruff\n* '''[[Dave Fennoy]]''' (credited as David Fennoy) - Pawnshop Owner\n* '''[[Don Messick]]''' - Ali / Gnomes\n* '''[[Neil Ross]]''' - Chess Knights \n* '''[[Russi Taylor]]''' - Beauty / Lady Celeste / Ghost Child / Oyster \n* '''[[Linda Gary]]''' (credited as Linda Grey) - Oracle / Red Chess Queen / Mother Ghost / Queen Allaria\n* '''[[Josh Mandel (video game designer)|Josh Mandel]]''' - King Graham / Shamir Shamazel / Oxymoron / Druid / Guard Dog\n* '''[[Chuck McCann]]''' - Jollo / Bookworm / Bump-on-a-Log / Woof \n* '''[[Patrick Pinney]]''' - Winged One / Diphthong\n* '''David Prince''' - Dangling Participle / Stick-in-the-mud \n\n\n==Development==\n''King's Quest'' creator and designer [[Roberta Williams]] first met with [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]] newcomer and co-designer [[Jane Jensen]] (who would go on to create the ''[[Gabriel Knight]]'' series)<ref name=\"ACG\">{{cite web|last1=Hagerup|first1=Eivind|title=King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow|url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/63/|publisher=Adventure Classic Gaming|accessdate=4 April 2017|date=20 April 1998}}</ref> in May 1991 to discuss the design for the upcoming sixth title in the series.{{sfn|Shannon|1992|p=2}} Williams began preliminary work on ''King's Quest VI'' in June, \"laying out the basic story\"<ref name=\"IAV5N3\">{{cite journal|last1=DeBaun|first1=Rich|title=The Quest for King's Quest VI|journal=InterAction Magazine|date=Fall 1992|volume=5|issue=3|pages=20\u201326|url=http://www.sierragamers.com/uploads/24082/Interaction/015_InterAction_Volume_5_Number_3_Fall_1992.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2017|publisher=[[Sierra On-Line]]}}</ref> and worked alongside Jensen throughout July and August on coming up with design ideas; after five months, Williams and Jensen finished the documentation for the design.{{sfn|Shannon|1992|p=2}}<ref name=\"IAV5N3\" /><ref name=\"EG\">{{cite journal|last1=Ceccola|first1=Russ|title=All about King's Quest VI: EG learns the inside scoop from Roberta Williams and Jane Jensen|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|date=February 1993|volume=1|issue=5|pages=84, 85}}</ref> Two key goals of the writers were to keep the game's tone consistent with its predecessors' while still making it a distinct title, and to make players connect emotionally with the game; Williams wrote the love story of Prince Alexander and Cassima specifically for this emotional attachment.<ref name=\"IAV5N3\" />\n\n[[File:Making of KQ6.png|thumb|left|Crew filming real-life actors for [[motion capture]] in a behind-the-scenes footage of ''King's Quest VI''.]]\nCo-director and project manager Bill Skirvin and the artists created the storyboards and character sketches.

It is not closely related to other languages and appears to form its own branch of the [[Niger\u2013Congo family]], although it was formerly classified as an [[Atlantic languages|Atlantic language]].<ref name=\"Guldemann\">{{Cite book|title=The Languages and Linguistics of Africa|last=G\u00fcldemann|first=Tom|editor-last=G\u00fcldemann|editor-first=Tom|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|chapter=Historical linguistics and genealogical language classification in Africa|year=2018|edition=|isbn=978-3-11-042606-9|doi=10.1515/9783110421668-002|location=Berlin|pages=58-444|series=The World of Linguistics series|volume=11}}</ref> Dialects include ''Tonko, Sela, Kamuke'' (or ''Ke''), ''Wara-wara, Keleng, Biriwa,'' and ''Safroko''. The eastern variety, spoken primarily in [[Guinea]], is quite distinct. Limba has a system of [[noun class]]es, marked by an old, eroded set of prefixes augmented by a newer set of [[enclitic]]s.\n\n==Distribution==\n''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists the following two varieties of Limba, spoken in [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]].\n\n'''East Limba''' is spoken in [[Our\u00e9-Kaba]], [[Guinea]].\n\n'''West-Central Limba''' is spoken in northern [[Sierra Leone]]. It is spoken in the [[Little Scarcies River]] area in east [[Bombali District]] and northeast [[Kambia District]], as well as north of [[Makeni]].\n\n==Phonology==\nLike neighboring [[Temne language|Temne]], Limba has an unusual contrast among its consonants. It distinguishes [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], but the dental consonants are [[apical consonant|apical]] and the alveolar consonants are [[laminal consonant|laminal]], the opposite of the general pattern.<ref>{{SOWL|42}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Noun classes===\nNoun classes are distinguished by the form of the definite article (class particle) which follows the noun, and sometimes also by a prefix. Roughly, the following classes can be deduced from the examples given by Mary Lane Clarke:<ref>Mary Lane Clarke, ''A Limba\u2013English Dictionary, or, Tampe\u0148 ta ka Talu\u0148 ta ka Hulimba ha in Hui\u0148kilisi ha'', Houghton, New York, 1922, reprinted 1971 by Gregg International Publishers, Farnborough, England. {{page missing|date=August 2018}} This information is based on the '''Biriwa''' and '''Safroko''' dialects.</ref>\n\nA.
