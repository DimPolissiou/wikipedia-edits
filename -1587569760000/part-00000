To meet the characteristics for the next-generation aircraft, work was underway on two aircraft projects: the twin-engined delta canard [[Sukhoi Su-47]] with [[forward-swept wing]]s and the [[Mikoyan Project 1.44]]. However, due to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and lack of funds, both remained only as technology demonstrators.\n\nAfter 2000, the Russian Defence Ministry initiated a new fighter competition known as \"PAK FA\" ({{lang-ru|\u041f\u0410\u041a \u0424\u0410}}, {{lang-ru|label=short for|\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438|Perspektivny Aviatsionny Kompleks Frontovoy Aviatsii|'Prospective aeronautical complex of front-line air forces'}}) to develop a next-generation fighter for the Russian Air Force, with [[Sukhoi]] and [[Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG|MiG]] as the main competitors.
