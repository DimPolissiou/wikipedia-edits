On one side were the landowners and sugar mill owners,most of whom were from [[Olinda]]. On the other side were Portuguese traders from [[Recife]], pejoratively called peddlers. It ended in a stalemate at the seige of Recife by the militias. The Crown installed a new governer, who was partial to the traders in Recife. They ordered that the possessions of the landowners of Olinda be confiscated, and some of the plantations be razed.\n\n[[Image:Recife brazil rugendas.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]\n{{BrazilianHistory}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{missing information|dramatic increase in price of slaves|date=January 2014}}\n:''For history 1580-1640, see [[Iberian Union]]''\n\n:''For history 1630-1654, see [[Dutch Brazil]]''\n\nUntil the mid-17th century, [[Olinda]] was the main city of the [[Captaincy of Pernambuco]] in northeast Brazil, where sugar plantations owned by The Zilioto family operated. A lack of capital to invest in crops, equipment and manpower (slaves), combined with the declining price of sugar due to competition from European powers' investments in the [[West Indies]], caused a crisis.  In an effort to resolve this, the sugar planters of Olinda began to borrow money from traders in the settlement of [[Recife]].  At that time, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders (pejoratively called \"mascates,\" or \"peddlers\") living in Recife agreed to lend money to the planters in Olinda, but charged very high interest rates, increasing the planters' indebtedness.\n\nAware of Recife's economic importance, merchants asked [[John V of Portugal|king of Portugal]] that the settlement be elevated to town status. In February 1709, shortly after receiving the Royal Charter which declared it a town, merchants erected a town hall and a [[pillory]]. Recife was formally separated from Olinda, the seat of the Captaincy.\n\nEconomically dependent on Portuguese merchants, the landowners did not accept the politico-administrative elevation of Recife, before then a settlement which was subject to Olinda.

Having members of the landed aristocracy abandoned Olinda to escape the plantations where they lived, hostilities commenced in [[Vit\u00f3ria de Santo Ant\u00e3o]], led by their Captain General, Pedro Ribeiro da Silva. These forces, thickened in Afogados with reinforcements from S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o de Mata and Olinda, under the leadership of Bernardo Vieira de Melo and his father, Colonel Leonardo Bezerra Cavalcanti, invaded Recife, demolishing the [[pillory]], tearing the Provincial regal, freeing arrested and persecuting people connected to the governor Sebasti\u00e3o de Castro Caldas Barbosa (peddlers). This, in turn, in order to ensure their safety, he withdrew to [[Bahia]], and left the government over the captaincy of Bishop  [[Manuel \u00c1lvares da Costa]].

After the victory of the hawkers, traders perceived the predominance of trade in relation to colonial production that had already occurred since the lords of Olinda caught the interest on money borrowed so the peddlers can keep their colonial system.\n\nThe autonomist feeling of Pernambuco, which came from the fight against the Dutch, continued to manifest itself in other conflicts such as the [[Conspiracy of Suassuna]], [[Pernambucan Revolt|Pernambucan Revolution]] of 1817 against Portugal and the  [[Confederation of the Equator]] against Brazil.{{speculation inline}}{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[History of Pernambuco]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* Frei Joaquim do Amor Divino Caneca, Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Formadores do Brasil (Collection of Brazil Trainers), 1994 {{in lang|pt}}\n* \"The Golden Age of Brazil\", [[Charles Boxer]]\n\n== External links ==\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20121213152927/http://www.v-brazil.com/information/geography/pernambuco/history.html\n\n{{Portugal topics}}\n{{Brazil topics}}\n{{History of South America}}\n\n[[Category:Wars involving Brazil]]\n[[Category:1710 in Brazil]]\n[[Category:1711 in Brazil]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in Brazil]]\n[[Category:Portuguese colonization of the Americas]]\n[[Category:History of Recife]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced|date=October 2010}}\n{{cleanup|reason=The article is incomprehensible, and much of it is irrelevant.|date=January 2014}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Mascate War''' or the sugar war had ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Guerra dos Mascates''), also known as the '''War of the Peddlers''', was a conflict fought between two rival mercantile groups the zillioto  family and the Astrid family in [[colonial Brazil]] from Oct. 1710 to Aug. 1711.

Having members of the landed aristocracy abandoned Olinda to escape the plantations where they lived, hostilities commenced in [[Vit\u00f3ria de Santo Ant\u00e3o]], led by their Captain General, Pedro Ribeiro da Silva. These forces, thickened in Afogados with reinforcements from S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o de Mata and Olinda, under the leadership of Bernardo Vieira de Melo and his father, Colonel Leonardo Bezerra Cavalcanti, invaded Recife, demolishing the [[pillory]], tearing the Provincial regal, freeing arrested and persecuting people connected to the governor Sebasti\u00e3o de Castro Caldas Barbosa (peddlers). This, in turn, in order to ensure their safety, he withdrew to [[Bahia]], and left the government over the captaincy of Bishop  [[Manuel \u00c1lvares da Costa]].  The crown appointed a new governor F\u00e9lix Jos\u00e9 de Mendon\u00e7a.\nThe peddlers fought back in 1712, invading Olinda and causing fires and destroying villages and plantations in the region.\n{{#tag:ref|\n{{Cleanup translation|Portuguese}}\nIn the 19th century, [[Frei Caneca]] wrote about it: \"When the country lacked the arms and blood of their sons, along with the browns have not given him his arms and blood whites and blacks? When those tears have washed their irons despotism, did not go well with the edge of tears? Before the pernambucanos have suffered more than other major storms in Pernambuco. Sedition in the last century, all entering the fray, only about white people came the plagues and lightning, the dungeons were full of the most respectable people of Pernambuco, others piled on more entrenched in the woods and distant hinterlands, and they were loaded irons and sent to Portugal.

The commercial bourgeoisie was supported by the metropolis, and Recife maintained its autonomy.\nThe city intervened in the region in 1711, arresting the leaders of the rebellion. Finally after much struggling, which included the intervention of colonial authorities, this fact was consummated in 1711: Recife was to be treated like Olinda from that time on.after the war the zilioto family was cursed to die of corse it was just a superstition \n\n== Legacy ==\nWith the victory of the merchants, the war reaffirmed the dominance of merchant capital (trade) on the colonial production. After the victory of the hawkers, traders perceived the predominance of trade in relation to colonial production that had already occurred since the lords of Olinda caught the interest on money borrowed so the peddlers can keep their colonial system.\n\nThe autonomist feeling of Pernambuco, which came from the fight against the Dutch, continued to manifest itself in other conflicts such as the [[Conspiracy of Suassuna]], [[Pernambucan Revolt|Pernambucan Revolution]] of 1817 against Portugal and the  [[Confederation of the Equator]] against Brazil.{{speculation inline}}{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[History of Pernambuco]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* Frei Joaquim do Amor Divino Caneca, Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Formadores do Brasil (Collection of Brazil Trainers), 1994 {{in lang|pt}}\n* \"The Golden Age of Brazil\", [[Charles Boxer]]\n\n== External links ==\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20121213152927/http://www.v-brazil.com/information/geography/pernambuco/history.html\n\n{{Portugal topics}}\n{{Brazil topics}}\n{{History of South America}}\n\n[[Category:Wars involving Brazil]]\n[[Category:1710 in Brazil]]\n[[Category:1711 in Brazil]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in Brazil]]\n[[Category:Portuguese colonization of the Americas]]\n[[Category:History of Recife]]\n", "name_user": "SucculentLeaves", "label": "safe", "comment": "cleanup on the first section. finna go check the edit history. someones editing in \"subscribe to my Chanel\" messages , coco chanel involvement suspected", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascate_War"}

It is the sequel to [[IndyCar Racing]], and was released in 1995 for the [[MS-DOS]], [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. A little over a year later, the game was re-released, with a few minor upgrades, under the title '''CART Racing'''. The name change came about as a result of the [[Champ Car|CART]] series losing licensing rights to the name ''IndyCar'', after the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] and [[Indy Racing League|IRL]] lockout in 1996.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game still used many contemporary drivers, chassis (Lola, Reynard, Penske) and engines (Ford-Cosworth, Mercedes-Benz, Honda). 15 circuits were included in this game with Miami (road course) and Indianapolis missing.\n\n==Development==\nThis game is based on the 1989 game ''[[Indianapolis 500: The Simulation|Indianapolis 500]]'' and on Papyrus' 1993 ''[[IndyCar Racing]]''.

A little over a year later, the game was re-released, with a few minor upgrades, under the title '''CART Racing'''. The name change came about as a result of the [[Champ Car|CART]] series losing licensing rights to the name ''IndyCar'', after the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] and [[Indy Racing League|IRL]] lockout in 1996.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game still used many contemporary drivers, chassis (Lola, Reynard, Penske) and engines (Ford-Cosworth, Mercedes-Benz, Honda). 15 circuits were included in this game with Miami (road course) and Indianapolis missing.\n\n==Development==\nThis game is based on the 1989 game ''[[Indianapolis 500: The Simulation|Indianapolis 500]]'' and on Papyrus' 1993 ''[[IndyCar Racing]]''. Little is known about the development of the game, but a demo for the game was released in 1995, and several patches for the [[DOS]] and [[Windows 95]] were created after the game's release to improve it.

Colors are harmonized to achieve a balanced, unified, and aesthetically pleasing effect for the viewer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nColor harmony is achieved in a variety of ways, some of which consist of combining a set of colors that share the same hue, or a set of colors that share the same values for two of the three color characteristics (hue, saturation, brightness).<ref name=\":1\" /> Color harmony can also be achieved by simply combining colors that are considered compatible to one another<ref name=\":1\" /> as represented in the [[color wheel]].\n\n*[[Contrast (vision)|'''Color contrasts''']]\n\n[[Contrast (vision)|Color contrasts]] are studied with a pair of colors, as opposed to color harmony, which studies a set of colors.

Lines can be vertical, horizontal, diagonal or curved. They can be any width or texture. And can be continuous, implied, or broken. On top of that, there are different types of line, aside from the ones previously mentioned. For example, you could have a line that is \nhorizontal and zigzagged or a line that is vertical and zigzagged. Different lines create different moods, it all depends on what mood you are using a line to create.\n\n=== Point ===\nA Point is basically the beginning of \u201csomething\u201d in \u201cnothing\u201d. It forces the mind to think upon its position and gives something to build upon in both imagination and space. Some abstract points in a group can provoke human imagination to link it with familiar shapes or forms\n\n===Shape===\n{{main|Shape and form (visual arts)}}\nA [[shape]] is defined as a two dimensional area that stands out from the space next to or around it due to a defined or implied boundary, or because of differences of value, color, or texture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ehhs.kent.edu/community/VLO/design/elements/shape/index.html | title=Visual Literacy |author=Cindy Kovalik, Ph.D. and Peggy King, M.Ed. |accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref> Shapes are recognizable objects and forms<ref name=\":0\" /> and are usually composed of other elements of design.<ref name=\"Design Notes\">{{cite web|last=Saw|first=James|title=Design Notes|url=http://daphne.palomar.edu/design/Default.htm|publisher=Palomar College|accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor example, a [[square]] that is drawn on a piece of paper is considered a shape. It is created with a series of lines which serve as a boundary that shapes the square and separates it from the space around it that is not part of the square.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Types of shapes====\n[[Geometric shape|'''Geometric shapes''']] or mechanical shapes are shapes that can be drawn using a ruler or compass, such as [[square]]s, [[circle]]s, [[triangle]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[parallelogram]]s, [[Star polygon|stars]], and so on.<ref name=\":0\" /> Mechanical shapes, whether simple or complex, produce a feeling of control and order.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\n[[Organic form|'''Organic shapes''']] are irregular shapes<ref name=\":0\" /> that are often complex and resemble shapes that are found in [[nature]].<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> Organic shapes can be drawn by hand, which is why they are sometimes subjective and only exist in the imagination of the artist.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Curvilinear shapes''' are composed of curved lines and smooth edges. They give off a more natural feeling to the shape. In contrast, '''rectilinear shapes''' are composed of sharp edges and [[right angle]]s, and give off a sense of order in the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]. They look more human-made, structured, and [[Artificiality|artificial]]. Artists can choose to create a composition that revolves mainly around one of these styles of shape, or they can choose to combine both.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Texture===\n{{main|Texture (visual arts)}}\n[[File:Texture arbre.jpg|thumb|This is only a two dimensional image of a tree, but appears to have the texture of three dimensional bark.]]\n[[Texture (visual arts)|Texture]] refers to the physical and visual qualities of a surface.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==== Uses of texture in design ====\n\n* Texture can be used to attract or repel interest to an element, depending on how pleasant the texture is perceived to be.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> \n* Texture can also be used to add complex detail into the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of a design.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* In theatrical design, the surface qualities of a costume sculpts the look and feel of a character, which influences the way the audience reacts to the character.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Types of texture\n\n'''Tactile texture''', also known as \"actual texture\", refers to the physical three-dimensional texture of an object. Tactile texture can be perceived by the sense of touch. A person can feel the tactile texture of a sculpture by running their hand over its surface and feelings its ridges and dents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Painters use [[impasto]] to build peaks and create texture in their painting.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n* Texture can be created through [[collage]]. This is when artists assemble three dimensional objects and apply them onto a two-dimensional surface, like a piece of paper or canvas, to create one final composition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Papier coll\u00e9]] is another collaging technique in which artists glue paper to a surface to create different textures on its surface.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]] is a technique that consists of assembling various three-dimensional objects into a sculpture, which can also reveal textures to the viewer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Visual texture''', also referred to as \"implied texture\", is not detectable by our sense of touch, but by our sense of sight.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Visual texture is the illusion of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface.<ref name=\":0\" /> Any texture perceived in an image or photograph is a visual texture.

Colors are harmonized to achieve a balanced, unified, and aesthetically pleasing effect for the viewer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nColor harmony is achieved in a variety of ways, some of which consist of combining a set of colors that share the same hue, or a set of colors that share the same values for two of the three color characteristics (hue, saturation, brightness).<ref name=\":1\" /> Color harmony can also be achieved by simply combining colors that are considered compatible to one another<ref name=\":1\" /> as represented in the [[color wheel]].\n\n*[[Contrast (vision)|'''Color contrasts''']]\n\n[[Contrast (vision)|Color contrasts]] are studied with a pair of colors, as opposed to color harmony, which studies a set of colors. In color contrasting, two colors with perceivable differences in aspects such as luminance, or saturation, are placed side by side to create contrast.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[Johannes Itten]] presented seven kinds of color contrasts: contrast of light and dark, contrast of hue, contrast of temperature, contrast of [[Colorfulness|saturation]], simultaneous contrast, contrast of sizes, and contrast of complementary.<ref name=\":1\" /> These seven kinds of color contrasts have inspired past works involving color schemes in design.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*[[Color scheme|'''Color schemes''']]\n\n[[Color scheme]]s are defined as the set of colors chosen for a design.

Lines can be vertical, horizontal, diagonal or curved. They can be any width or texture. And can be continuous, implied, or broken. On top of that, there are different types of line, aside from the ones previously mentioned. For example, you could have a line that is \nhorizontal and zigzagged or a line that is vertical and zigzagged. Different lines create different moods, it all depends on what mood you are using a line to create.\n\n=== Point ===\nA Point is basically the beginning of \u201csomething\u201d in \u201cnothing\u201d.

It is created with a series of lines which serve as a boundary that shapes the square and separates it from the space around it that is not part of the square.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Types of shapes====\n[[Geometric shape|'''Geometric shapes''']] or mechanical shapes are shapes that can be drawn using a ruler or compass, such as [[square]]s, [[circle]]s, [[triangle]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[parallelogram]]s, [[Star polygon|stars]], and so on.<ref name=\":0\" /> Mechanical shapes, whether simple or complex, produce a feeling of control and order.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\n[[Organic form|'''Organic shapes''']] are irregular shapes<ref name=\":0\" /> that are often complex and resemble shapes that are found in [[nature]].<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> Organic shapes can be drawn by hand, which is why they are sometimes subjective and only exist in the imagination of the artist.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Curvilinear shapes''' are composed of curved lines and smooth edges. They give off a more natural feeling to the shape. In contrast, '''rectilinear shapes''' are composed of sharp edges and [[right angle]]s, and give off a sense of order in the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]. They look more human-made, structured, and [[Artificiality|artificial]]. Artists can choose to create a composition that revolves mainly around one of these styles of shape, or they can choose to combine both.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Texture===\n{{main|Texture (visual arts)}}\n[[File:Texture arbre.jpg|thumb|This is only a two dimensional image of a tree, but appears to have the texture of three dimensional bark.]]\n[[Texture (visual arts)|Texture]] refers to the physical and visual qualities of a surface.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==== Uses of texture in design ====\n\n* Texture can be used to attract or repel interest to an element, depending on how pleasant the texture is perceived to be.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> \n* Texture can also be used to add complex detail into the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of a design.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* In theatrical design, the surface qualities of a costume sculpts the look and feel of a character, which influences the way the audience reacts to the character.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Types of texture\n\n'''Tactile texture''', also known as \"actual texture\", refers to the physical three-dimensional texture of an object. Tactile texture can be perceived by the sense of touch. A person can feel the tactile texture of a sculpture by running their hand over its surface and feelings its ridges and dents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Painters use [[impasto]] to build peaks and create texture in their painting.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n* Texture can be created through [[collage]]. This is when artists assemble three dimensional objects and apply them onto a two-dimensional surface, like a piece of paper or canvas, to create one final composition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Papier coll\u00e9]] is another collaging technique in which artists glue paper to a surface to create different textures on its surface.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]] is a technique that consists of assembling various three-dimensional objects into a sculpture, which can also reveal textures to the viewer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Visual texture''', also referred to as \"implied texture\", is not detectable by our sense of touch, but by our sense of sight.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Visual texture is the illusion of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface.<ref name=\":0\" /> Any texture perceived in an image or photograph is a visual texture.

The DLS method is an attempt to set a statistically fair target for the second team's innings, which is the same difficulty as the original target. The basic principle is that each team in a limited-overs match has two resources available with which to score runs (overs to play and wickets remaining), and the target is adjusted proportionally to the change in the combination of these two resources.\n\n==History and creation==\nVarious different methods had been used previously to resolve rain-affected cricket games, with the most common being the [[Average Run Rate method]] and the [[Most Productive Overs method]]. \n\nThese earlier methods, while simple in nature, had intrinsic flaws that meant they produced unfair revised targets that altered the balance of the match, and were easily exploitable:\n* The Average Run Rate method took no account of how many wickets were lost by the team batting second, but simply reflected how quickly they were scoring when the match was interrupted. So, if a team felt a rain stoppage was likely, they could attempt to force the scoring rate without regard for the corresponding highly likely loss of wickets, skewing the comparison with the first team. \n* The Most Productive Overs method also took no account of wickets lost by the team batting second, and effectively penalised the team batting second for good bowling by ignoring their best overs in setting the revised target.\n\n[[File:India Vs New zealand One day International, 10 December 2010 (6159936713).jpg|thumb|D/L began in [[one-day international]]s]]\n\nThe D/L method was devised by two British [[statistician]]s, [[Frank Duckworth]] and [[Tony Lewis (mathematician)|Tony Lewis]], as a result of the outcome to the semi-final in the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]] between England and South Africa, where the ''Most Productive Overs'' method was used. Rain stopped play for 12 minutes with [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] needing 22 runs from 13 balls. The revised target left South Africa needing 21 runs from one ball, a reduction of only one run compared to a reduction of two overs, and a virtually impossible target given that the maximum score from one ball is generally six runs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Miller|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/280142.html|title=22 off one ball \u2013 A farcical rain rule leaves everyone bewildered|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|work=Cricinfo|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nDuckworth said, \"I recall hearing [[Christopher Martin-Jenkins]] on radio saying 'surely someone, somewhere could come up with something better' and I soon realised that it was a mathematical problem that required a mathematical solution.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/274677.html|title=A decade of Duckworth-Lewis|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|date=1 January 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=A decade of Duckworth-Lewis|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6222943.stm |work=BBC Sport|date=1 January 2007}}</ref> \n\nThe D/L method avoids this flaw: in this match, the revised D/L target would have left South Africa four to tie or five to win from the final ball.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/tms/6502207.stm|title=Stump the Bearded Wonder|work=BBC Sport|date=28 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe D/L method was first used in international cricket on 1 January 1997 in the second match of the Zimbabwe versus England [[One Day International|ODI]] series, which [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] won by seven runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1996-97/ENG_IN_ZIM/ENG_ZIM_ODI2_01JAN1997.html|title=Full Scorecard of Zimbabwe v England 2nd ODI 1997|date=1 January 1997|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|work=Cricinfo}}</ref> The D/L method was formally adopted by the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] in 1999 as the standard method of calculating target scores in rain-shortened [[one-day cricket|one-day]] matches.\n\n==Theory==\n===Calculation summary===\nThe essence of the D/L method is 'resources'. Each team is taken to have two 'resources' to use to score as many runs as possible: the number of [[over (cricket)|over]]s they have to receive; and the number of [[Dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] they have in hand. At any point in any [[innings]], a team's ability to score more runs depends on the combination of these two resources they have left. Looking at historical scores, there is a very close correspondence between the availability of these resources and a team's final score, a correspondence which D/L exploits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daa.com.au/analytical-ideas/cricket/|title=The Duckworth-Lewis Method|publisher=Data Analysis Australia|date=September 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:(Duckworth Lewis) method of adjusting target scores.PNG|thumb|300px|A published table of resource remaining percentages, for all combinations of wickets lost and whole overs left]]\n\nThe D/L method converts all possible combinations of overs (or, more accurately, balls) and wickets left into a combined resources remaining [[percentage]] figure (with 50 overs and 10 wickets = 100%), and these are all stored in a published table or computer. The target score for the team batting second ('Team 2') can be adjusted up or down from the total the team batting first ('Team 1') achieved using these resource percentages, to reflect the loss of resources to one or both teams when a match is shortened one or more times.\n\nIn the version of D/L most commonly in use in international and [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches (the 'Professional Edition'), the target for Team 2 is adjusted simply in [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] to the two teams' resources, i.e.\n\n: <math>\\text{Team 2's par score }=\\text{ Team 1's score} \\times \\frac{\\text{Team 2's resources}}{\\text{Team 1's resources}}.</math>\n\nIf, as usually occurs, this 'par score' is a non-[[integer]] number of runs, then Team 2's target to win is this number rounded up to the next integer, and the score to [[The result in cricket#Tie|tie]] (also called the par score), is this number rounded down to the preceding integer. If Team 2 reaches or passes the target score, then they have won the match. If the match ends when Team 2 has exactly met (but not passed) the par score then the match is a tie. If Team 2 fail to reach the par score then they have lost.\n\nFor example, if a rain delay means that Team 2 only has 90% of resources available, and Team 1 scored 254 with 100% of resources available, then 254&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;90%&nbsp;/&nbsp;100%&nbsp;=&nbsp;228.6, so Team 2's target is 229, and the score to tie is 228. The actual resource values used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available,<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ABOUT_CRICKET/RAIN_RULES/DL_FAQ.html|title=D/L method: answers to frequently asked questions|author1=Frank Duckworth|author2=Tony Lewis|work=Crickinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|date=December 2008}}</ref> so a computer which has this software loaded must be used.\n\nIf it is a 50-over match and Team 1 completed its innings uninterrupted, then they had 100% resource available to them, so the formula simplifies to:\n\n: <math>\\text{Team 2's par score }=\\text{ Team 1's score} \\times \\text{Team 2's resources}. </math>\n\n===Summary of impact on Team 2's target===\n*If there is a delay before the first innings starts, so that the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced but still the same as each other, then D/L makes no change to the target score, because both sides are aware of the total number of overs and wickets throughout their innings, thus they will have the same resources available.\n*Team 2's target score is first calculated once Team 1's innings has finished.\n*If there were interruption(s) during Team 1's innings, or Team 1's innings was cut short, so the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced (but still the same as each other), then D/L will adjust Team 2's target score as described above. The adjustment to Team 2's target after interruptions in Team 1's innings is often an increase, implying that Team 2 has more resource available than Team 1 had. Although both teams have 10 wickets and the same (reduced) number of overs available, an increase is fair as, for some of their innings, Team 1 ''thought'' they would have more overs available than they actually ended up having. If Team 1 had known that their innings was going to be shorter, they would have batted less conservatively, and scored more runs (at the expense of more wickets). They saved some wicket resource to use up in the overs that ended up being cancelled, which Team 2 does not need to do, therefore Team 2 ''does'' have more resource to use in the same number of overs. Therefore, increasing Team 2's target score compensates Team 1 for the denial of some of the overs they thought they would get to bat. The increased target is what D/L thinks Team 1 would have scored in the overs it ended up having, if it had known throughout that the innings would be only as long as it was.\n:For example, if Team 1 batted for 20 overs before rain came, thinking they would have 50 overs in total, but at the re-start there was only time for Team 2 to bat for 20 overs, it would clearly be unfair to give Team 2 the target that Team 1 achieved, as Team 1 would have batted less conservatively and scored more runs, if they had known they would only have the 20 overs.\n*If there are interruption(s) to Team 2's innings, either before it starts, during, or it is cut short, then D/L will reduce Team 2's target score from the initial target set at the end of Team 1's innings, in proportion to the reduction in Team 2's resources. If there are multiple interruptions in the second innings, the target will be adjusted downwards each time.\n*If there are interruptions which both increase and decrease the target score, then the net effect on the target could be either an increase or decrease, depending on which interruptions were bigger.\n\n===Mathematical theory===\nThe original D/L model started by assuming that the number of runs that can still be scored (called <math>Z</math>), for a given number of overs remaining (called <math>u</math>) and wickets lost (called <math>w</math>), takes the following [[exponential decay]] relationship:<ref name=OrigPaper>{{Cite journal |last1=Duckworth |first1=FC |last2=Lewis|first2= AJ |year=1998 |title=A fair method for resetting the target in interrupted one-day cricket matches |journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=220\u2013227 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600524 |citeseerx=10.1.1.180.3272 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>Z(u,w) = Z_0(w)\\left({1 - e^{-b(w)u} } \\right),</math>\n\nwhere the constant <math>Z_0</math> is the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] average total score in unlimited overs (under one-day rules), and <math>b</math> is the exponential decay constant. Both vary with <math>w</math> (only). The values of these two parameters for each <math>w</math> from 0 to 9 were [[Estimation|estimated]] from scores from 'hundreds of one-day internationals' and 'extensive research and experimentation', though were not disclosed due to 'commercial confidentiality'.<ref name=\"OrigPaper\"/>\n\n[[Image:DuckworthLewisEng.png|right|Scoring potential as a function of [[wicket]]s and [[over (cricket)|overs]].]]\nFinding the value of <math>Z</math> for a particular combination of <math>u</math> and <math>w</math> (by putting in <math>u</math> and the values of these constants for the particular <math>w</math>), and dividing this by the score achievable at the start of the innings, i.e. finding\n:<math>P(u,w) = \\frac{Z(u,w)}{Z(u=50,w=0)},\\,</math>\ngives the proportion of the combined run scoring resources of the innings remaining when <math>u</math> overs are left and <math>w</math> wickets are down.<ref name=\"OrigPaper\"/> These proportions can be plotted in a graph, as shown right, or shown in a single table, as shown below.\n\nThis became the Standard Edition. When it was introduced, it was necessary that D/L could be implemented with a single table of\nresource percentages, as it could not be guaranteed that computers would be present. Therefore, this single formula was used giving average resources. This method relies on the assumption that average performance is proportional to the mean, irrespective of the actual score. This was good enough in 95 per cent of matches, but in the 5 per cent of matches with very high scores, the simple approach started to break down.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Duckworth |first=Frank |year=2008 |title=The Duckworth/Lewis method: an exercise in Maths, Stats, OR and communications |journal=MSOR Connections |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=11\u201314 |url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/msor.8.3d.pdf |publisher=HE Academy|doi=10.11120/msor.2008.08030011 }}</ref> To overcome the problem, an upgraded formula was proposed with an additional parameter whose value depends on the Team 1 innings.<ref name=SecondPaper>{{Cite journal |last=Duckworth |first=FC |last2=Lewis|first2= AJ |year=2004 |title=A successful Operational Research intervention in one-day cricket |journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society |volume=55 |issue=7 |pages=749\u2013759 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601717 |pmid= |bibcode= |ref=}}</ref> This became the Professional Edition.\n\n==Examples==\n===Stoppage in first innings===\n====Increased target====\nIn the 4th [[Indian Cricket Team|India]] \u2013 [[England cricket team|England]] ODI in the 2008 series, the first innings was interrupted by rain on two occasions, resulting in the match being reduced to 22 overs each. India (batting first) made 166/4. England's target was set by the D/L method at 198 from 22 overs. As England ''knew'' they had only 22 overs the expectation is that they will be able to score more runs from those overs than India had from their (interrupted) innings.

Pakistan, batting second, were 311/7 when bad light stopped play after the 47th over. Pakistan's target, had the match continued, was 18 runs in 18 balls, with three wickets in hand. Considering the overall scoring rate throughout the match, this is a target most teams would be favoured to achieve. And indeed, application of the D/L method resulted in a retrospective target score of 305 (or par score of 304) at the end of the 47th over, with the result therefore officially listed as \"Pakistan won by 7 runs (D/L Method)\".\n\nThe D/L method was used in the group stage match between [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] at the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20#Group B|20/20 World Cup in 2010]]. Sri Lanka scored 173/7 in 20 overs batting first, and in reply Zimbabwe were 4/0 from 1 over when rain interrupted play. At the restart Zimbabwe's target was reduced to 108 from 12 overs, but rain stopped the match when they had scored 29/1 from 5 overs. The retrospective D/L target from 5 overs was a further reduction to 44, or a par score of 43, and hence Sri Lanka won the match by 14 runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/world-twenty20-2010/engine/current/match/412686.html|title=Full Scorecard of Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe ICC Men's T20 World Cup 7th Match Group B|date=3 May 2010|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/world-twenty20-2010/content/story/458306.html|title=Jayawardene ton floors Zimbabwe|date=3 May 2010|author=Sriram Veera|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media}}</ref>\n\nAn example of a D/L tied match was the ODI between England and India on 11 September 2011. This match was frequently interrupted by rain in the final overs, and a ball-by-ball calculation of the Duckworth\u2013Lewis 'par' score played a key role in tactical decisions during those overs. At one point, India were leading under D/L during one rain delay, and would have won if play had not resumed. At a second rain interval, England, who had scored some quick runs (knowing they needed to get ahead in D/L terms) would correspondingly have won if play had not resumed. Play was finally called off with just 7 balls of the match remaining and England's score equal to the Duckworth\u2013Lewis 'par' score, therefore resulting in a tie.\n\nThis example does show how crucial (and difficult) the decisions of the umpires can be, in assessing when rain is heavy enough to justify ceasing play. If the umpires of that match had halted play one ball earlier, England would have been ahead on D/L, and so would have won the match. Equally, if play had stopped one ball later, India could have won the match with a [[dot ball]] \u2013 indicating how finely-tuned D/L calculations can be in such situations.\n\n===Stoppages in both innings===\nDuring the [[2012\u201313 Big Bash League season#Knockout stage 2|2012/13 KFC Big Bash League]], D/L was used in the 2nd semi-final played between the [[Melbourne Stars]] and the [[Perth Scorchers]]. After rain delayed the start of the match, it interrupted Melbourne's innings when they had scored 159/1 off 15.2 overs, and both innings were reduced by 2 overs to 18, and Melbourne finished on 183/2. After a further rain delay reduced Perth's innings to 17 overs, Perth returned to the field to face 13 overs, with a revised target of 139. Perth won the game by 8 wickets with a boundary off the final ball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/571265.html|title=Full Scorecard of Perth Scorchers vs Melbourne Stars, Big Bash League 2nd semi-final|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|date=16 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2012/content/story/601098.html|title=Scorchers prevail in dramatic, rain-hit match|author=Alex Malcolm|date=16 January 2013|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media}}</ref>\n\n==Use and updates==\nThe published table that underpins the D/L method is regularly updated,{{what|date=August 2019}} using source data from more recent matches; this is done on July 1st <ref>Professor Steven Sern interview with Simon Sharwood from Register.co.uk https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/12/just_not_cricket_microsofts_big_data_googly_declared_no_ball_bowled_by_rain_man/ </ref>\n\nFor 50-over matches decided by D/L, each team must face at least 20 overs for the result to be valid. For [[Twenty20]] games decided by D/L, each side must face at least five overs. These minimum limits do not apply to innings where a team is bowled out or reaches its target early. If the conditions prevent a match from reaching this minimum length, it is declared a [[no result]].\n\n===1996\u20132003 \u2013 Single version===\nUntil 2003, a single version of D/L was in use. This used a single published reference table of total resource percentages remaining for all possible combinations of overs and wickets,<ref name=\"DLMethod\">[http://static.ecb.co.uk/files/3140-fc-domestic-duckworthlewis-2013-p127-140-lr-12376.pdf Duckworth/Lewis Method of Re-calculating the Target Score in an Interrupted Match] ECB, 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211845/http://static.ecb.co.uk/files/3140-fc-domestic-duckworthlewis-2013-p127-140-lr-12376.pdf |date=22 February 2014 }}</ref> and some simple [[mathematical]] calculations, and was relatively transparent and straightforward to implement.\n\nHowever, a flaw in how it handled very high first innings scores (350+) became apparent from the 1999 Cricket World Cup match in Bristol between India and Kenya. Tony Lewis noticed that there was an inherent weakness in the formula that would give a noticeable advantage to the side chasing a total in excess of 350. A correction was built into the formula and the software, but was not fully adopted until 2004. One-day matches were achieving significantly higher scores than in previous decades, affecting the historical relationship between resources and runs. The second version uses more sophisticated statistical modelling, but does not use a single table of resource percentages. Instead, the percentages also vary with score, so a computer is required.<ref name=FAQ/> Therefore, it loses some of the previous advantages of transparency and simplicity.\n\nIn 2002 the resource percentages were revised, following an extensive analysis of limited overs matches, and there was a change to the [[Duckworth\u2013Lewis method#Step 2. Convert the two teams.27 batting resources into Team 2.27s target score|G50]] for ODIs. (G50 is the average score expected from the team batting first in an uninterrupted 50 overs-per-innings match.) G50 was changed to 235 for ODIs. These changes came into effect on 1 September 2002.<ref name=\"DLM2002\"/> As of 2014, these resource percentages are the ones still in use in the Standard Edition, though G50 has subsequently changed.\n\nThe tables show how the percentages were in 1999 and 2001, and what they were changed to in 2002.

Find the batting resources available to each team===\n\nAfter each reduction in overs, the new total batting resources available to the two teams are found, using figures for the total amount of batting resources ''remaining'' for any combination of overs and wickets. While the process for converting these resources remaining figures into total resource available figures is the same in the two Editions, this can be done manually in the Standard Edition, as the resource remaining figures are published in a reference table.<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/> However, the resource remaining figures used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available,<ref name=FAQ/> so a computer must be used which has the software loaded.\n\n*If a team loses resource at the ''start'' of an innings (left hand image below), then this is simple. For example, if the first 20 overs of an innings are lost, then 30 overs and 10 wickets are remaining, which is 75.1% in the Standard Edition, so this is the resource available.\n*If a team loses resource at the ''end'' of its innings (centre image below), then the resource that was available to that team is found by taking the resources it had at the start, and [[subtraction|subtracting]] the resources remaining at the point the innings was ended. For example, if a team starts with 50 overs and 10 wickets (100% of its resources), but its innings is ended with 20 overs and 8 wickets remaining (52.4% of its resources), then the resources it actually used is 100% &minus; 52.4% = 47.6%.\n*If a team loses resource in the ''middle'' of its innings (right hand image below), then the resource that was available to that team is found by taking the resources it had at the start, and subtracting the resources remaining at the point the innings was interrupted (to give the resources used in the first period of the innings), then adding on the resource remaining at the restart. For example, if a team starts with 50 overs and 10 wickets (100% of its resources), but is interrupted when it still has 40 overs and 8 wickets remaining (77.8% of its resources), and restarted when it has 20 overs and 8 wickets remaining (52.4% of its resources), then the resources it actually used is 100% &minus; 77.8% + 52.4% = 74.6%. Another way of looking at this is to say it lost the resources available between 40 overs and 8 wickets (77.8%) and 20 overs and 8 wickets (52.4%), i.e. 77.8% &minus; 52.4% = 25.4%, so its total resource available was 100% &minus; 25.4% = 74.6%.\n\n'''[[File:DuckworthLewisDiag1.png|300px|DuckworthLewisDiag1]]''' \n[[File:DuckworthLewisDiag2.png|330px|DuckworthLewisDiag2]] \n[[File:DuckworthLewisDiag3.png|360px|DuckworthLewisDiag3]]\n\nThese are just the different ways of having one interruption. With multiple interruptions possible, it may seem like finding the total resource percentage requires a different calculation for each different scenario. However, the formula is actually the same each time &minus; it's just that different scenarios, with more or less interruptions and restarts, need to use more or less of the same formula. The total resources available to a team are given by:<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/>\n\n<!--<div style=\"background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 2px;\">-->\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 0); padding: 2px;\">\n{|\n|-\n|Total resources available = 100% &minus; Resources lost by 1st interruption &minus; Resources lost by 2nd interruption &minus; Resources lost by 3rd interruption &minus; ...\n|}\n</div>\n\nwhich can alternatively be written as:\n\n<!--<div style=\"background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 2px;\">-->\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 0); padding: 2px;\">\n{|\n|-\n|Total resources available = 100% &minus; Resources remaining at 1st interruption + Resources remaining at 1st restart &minus; Resources remaining at 2nd interruption + Resources remaining at 2nd restart &minus; Resources remaining at 3rd interruption + Resources remaining at 3rd restart &minus; ...\n|}\n</div>\n\nEach time there's an interruption or a restart after an interruption, the resource remaining percentages at those times (obtained from a reference table for the Standard Edition, or from a computer for the Professional Edition) can be entered into the formula, with the rest left blank. Note that a delay at the start of an innings counts as the 1st interruption.\n\n===Step 2. Convert the two teams' batting resources into Team 2's target score===\n\n'''Standard Edition'''\n\n*If R2&nbsp;<&nbsp;R1, reduce Team 2's target score in proportion to the reduction in total resources, i.e. '''S&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;R2/R1'''.\n*If R2&nbsp;=&nbsp;R1, no adjustment to Team 2's target score is needed.\n*If R2&nbsp;>&nbsp;R1, increase Team 2's target score by the extra runs that could be expected to be scored on average with the extra total resource, i.e. '''S&nbsp;+&nbsp;G50&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;(R2&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;R1)/100''', where G50 is the average 50-over total. Team 2's target score is not simply increased in proportion to the increase in total resources, i.e. S&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;R2/R1, as this 'could lead to some unrealistically high targets if Team 1 had achieved an early high rate of scoring [in the [[Powerplay (cricket)|powerplay]] overs] and rain caused a drastic reduction in the overs for the match.'<ref name=FAQ/> Instead, D/L Standard Edition requires average performance for Team 2's additional resource over Team 1.\n\n'''G50'''\n\nG50 is the average score expected from the team batting first in an uninterrupted 50 overs-per-innings match. This will vary with the level of competition and over time.

In fact it would be possible for the two captains to agree a value of G50 before the start of each match, taking account of all relevant factors. However, we do not believe that something that is only invoked if rain interferes with the game should impose itself on every game in this way. In any case, it should be realised that the value of G50 usually has very little effect on the revised target.

It is fair that their target was increased, even though they had the same number of overs to bat as Australia, as Australia would have batted less conservatively in their first 28 overs, and scored more runs at the expense of more wickets, if they had known that their innings would only be 36 overs long. Increasing the Netherlands' target score neutralises the injustice done to Australia when they were denied some of the overs to bat they thought they would get. The Netherlands were all out for 122, giving Australia victory by 197 &minus; 122 = 75 runs.\n\nThis formula for Netherlands' par score comes from the Standard Edition of D/L, which was used at the time. Currently the Professional Edition is used, which has a different formula when R2>R1. The formula required Netherlands to match Australia's performance with their overlapping 72.6% of resource (i.e. score 170 runs), and achieve average performance with their extra 84.1% &minus; 72.6% = 11.5% of resource (i.e. score 11.5% of G50 (235 at the time) = 27.025 runs).\n\nAfter the match there were reports in the media<ref name=\"AusNedReport\"/> that Australia had batted conservatively in their final 8 overs after the final restart, to avoid losing wickets rather than maximising their numbers of runs, in belief that this would further increase the Netherlands' par score. However, if this is true, this belief was mistaken, in the same way that conserving wickets rather than maximising runs in the final 8 overs of a full 50-over innings would be a mistake. At that point the amount of resource available to each team was fixed (as long as there were no further rain interruptions), so the only undetermined number in the formula for Netherlands' par score was Australia's final score, so they should have tried to maximise this.\n\nAs Australia's innings was interrupted three times (once before it started) and restarted three times, their resource is given by the general formula above as follows:\n\nTotal resources available = 100% &minus; Resources remaining at 1st interruption + Resources remaining at 1st restart &minus; Resources remaining at 2nd interruption + Resources remaining at 2nd restart &minus; Resources remaining at 3rd interruption + Resources remaining at 3rd restart = 100% &minus; 100% + 97.1% &minus; 55.8% + 50.5% &minus; 44.7% + 25.5% = 72.6%.\n\n==In-game strategy==\n===During team 1's innings===\n====Strategy for team 1====\nDuring Team 1's innings, the target score calculations (as described above), have not yet been made.\n\nThe objective of the team batting first is to maximise the target score which will be calculated for the team batting second, which (in the Professional Edition) will be determined by the formula:\n\n<math>\\text{Team 2's par score }=\\text{ Team 1's score} \\times \\frac{\\text{Team 2's resources}}{\\text{Team 1's resources}}.</math>\n\nFor these three terms:\n*'''Team 1's score''': Team 1 will always increase Team 2's target by increasing their own score. \n*At the start of Team 2's innings, '''Team 2's resources''' will be 10 wickets and the number of overs available, and Team 1 cannot affect this.\n*'''Team 1's resources''' are given by:\n\n<!--<div style=\"background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 2px;\">-->\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 0); padding: 2px;\">\n{|\n|-\n|Total resources available = 100% &minus; Resources lost by 1st interruption &minus; Resources lost by 2nd interruption &minus; Resources lost by 3rd interruption &minus; ...\n|}\n</div>\n\nIf there will not be any future interruptions to Team 1's innings, then the amount of resource available to them is now fixed (whether there have been interruptions so far or not), so the only thing Team 1 can do to increase Team 2's target is increase their own score, ignoring how many wickets they lose (as in a normal unaffected match).\n\nHowever, if there will be future interruptions to Team 1's innings, then an alternative strategy to scoring more runs is minimising the amount of resource they use before the coming interruption (i.e. preserving wickets). While the best overall strategy is obviously to both score more runs ''and'' preserve resources, if a choice has to be made between the two, sometimes preserving wickets at the expense of scoring runs ('conservative' batting) is a more effective way of increasing Team 2's target, and sometimes the reverse ('aggressive' batting) is true.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center; width:25%;\"\n|+ Percentage total resources remaining reference table (D/L Standard Edition)<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Overs remaining\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Wickets in hand\n|-\n| '''10''' || '''8''' || '''6''' || '''4''' || '''2''' \n|-\n| '''50''' || 100.0 || 85.1 || 62.7 || 34.9 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''40''' || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 89.3 || 77.8 || 59.5 || 34.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''30''' || 75.1 || 67.3 || 54.1 || 33.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''20''' || 56.6 || 52.4 || 44.6 || 30.8 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''10''' || 32.1 || 30.8 || 28.3 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 22.8 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 11.4 \n|-\n| '''5''' || 17.2 || 16.8 || 16.1 || 14.3 || 9.4 \n|}\n\nFor example, suppose Team 1 has been batting without interruptions, but thinks the innings will be cut short at 40 overs, i.e. with 10 overs left.

Team 1 thinks by batting conservatively it can reach 200\u20136, or by batting aggressively it can reach 220\u20138:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Batting strategy\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Conservative\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Aggressive\n|-\n| Runs Team 1 thinks it can score\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 220 \n|-\n| Wickets Team 1 thinks it will have in hand\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n|-\n| Resource remaining to Team 1 at cut-off\n| align=\"center\" | 22.8%\n| align=\"center\" | 11.4%\n|-\n| Resource used by Team 1\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 22.8% = 77.2%\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 11.4% = 88.6%\n|-\n| Team 2's par score\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | 200 + 250 x (89.3% - 77.2%) <br />= '''230.25 runs'''\n| align=\"center\" | 220 + 250 x (89.3% - 88.6%) <br />= '''221.75 runs'''\n|}\n\nTherefore, in this case, the conservative strategy achieves a higher target for Team 2.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center; width:25%;\"\n|+ Percentage total resources remaining reference table (D/L Standard Edition)<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Overs remaining\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Wickets in hand\n|-\n| '''10''' || '''8''' || '''6''' || '''4''' || '''2''' \n|-\n| '''50''' || 100.0 || 85.1 || 62.7 || 34.9 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''40''' || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 89.3 || 77.8 || 59.5 || 34.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''30''' || 75.1 || 67.3 || 54.1 || 33.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''20''' || 56.6 || 52.4 || 44.6 || 30.8 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''10''' || 32.1 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 30.8 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 28.3 || 22.8 || 11.4 \n|-\n| '''5''' || 17.2 || 16.8 || 16.1 || 14.3 || 9.4 \n|}\n\nHowever, suppose instead that the difference between the two strategies is scoring 200\u20132 or 220\u20134:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Batting strategy\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Conservative\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Aggressive\n|-\n| Runs Team 1 thinks it can score\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 220 \n|-\n| Wickets Team 1 thinks it will have in hand\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n|-\n| Resource remaining to Team 1 at cut-off\n| align=\"center\" | 30.8%\n| align=\"center\" | 28.3%\n|-\n| Resource used by Team 1\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 30.8% = 69.2%\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 28.3% = 71.7%\n|-\n| Team 2's par score\n| align=\"center\" | 200 + 250 x (89.3% - 69.2%) <br />= '''250.25 runs'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | 220 + 250 x (89.3% - 71.7%) <br />= '''264.00 runs'''\n|}\n\nIn this case, the aggressive strategy is better.\n\nTherefore, the best batting strategy for Team 1 ahead of a coming interruption is not always the same, but varies with the [[facts]] of the match situation to date (runs scored, wickets lost, overs used, and whether there have been interruptions), and also with the [[opinions]] about what will happen with each strategy (how many further runs will be scored, further wickets will be lost, and further overs will be used? How likely are the coming interruptions, when will they happen, and how long will they last \u2013 will Team 1's innings be restarted?).\n\nThis example shows just two possible batting strategies, but in reality there could be a range of others, e.g. 'neutral', 'semi-aggressive', 'super-aggressive', or [[timewasting]] to minimise the amount of resource used by slowing the over rate. Finding which strategy is the best can only be found by inputting the facts and one's opinions into the calculations and seeing what emerges.\n\nOf course, a chosen strategy may backfire. For example, if Team 1 chooses to bat conservatively, Team 2 may see this and decide to attack (rather than focus on saving runs), and Team 1 may both fail to score many more runs ''and'' lose wickets.\n\nIf there have already been interruptions to Team 1's innings, the calculation of total resource they use will be more complicated than this example.\n\n====Strategy for team 2====\nDuring Team 1's innings, Team 2's objective is to minimise the target score they will be set. This is achieved by minimising Team 1's score, or (as above), if there will be future interruptions to Team 1's innings, alternatively by maximising the resource used by Team 1 (i.e. wickets lost or overs bowled) before that happens. Team 2 can vary their bowling strategy (between conservative and aggressive) to try and achieve either of these objectives, so this means doing the same calculations as above, inputting their opinions of future runs conceded, wickets taken and overs bowled in each bowling strategy, to see which one is best.\n\nAlso, Team 2 can encourage Team 1 to bat particularly conservatively or aggressively (e.g. through [[Fielding (cricket)#Tactics of field placement|field settings]]).\n\n===During team 2's innings===\nA target (from a given number of overs) is set for Team 2 at the start of its innings. If there will not be any future interruptions, then both sides can play to a finish in the normal way. However, if there are likely to be interruptions to Team 2's innings, then Team 2 will aim to keep itself ahead of the D/L par score, and Team 1 will aim to keep them behind it. This is because, if a match is abandoned before the given number of overs is complete, Team 2 is declared the winner if they're ahead of the par score, and Team 1 is declared the winner if Team 2 are behind the par score. A tie is declared if Team 2 are exactly on the par score. (This is provided a minimum number of overs has been bowled in Team 2's innings.)\n\nThe par score increases with every ball bowled and every wicket lost, as the amount of resource used increases. As an example, in the [[2003 Cricket World Cup Final]] Australia batted first and scored 359 from 50 overs. As Australia completed their 50 overs, their total resources used R1=100%, so India's par score throughout their innings was: 359 x R2/100%, where R2 is the amount of resource used to that point. As shown in the first line of the table below, after 9 overs India were 57-1, and 41 overs and 9 wickets remaining equates to 85.3% of resources, so 100% &minus; 85.3% = 14.7% had been used. India's par score after 9 overs was therefore 359 x 14.7%/100% = 52.773, which is rounded down to 52.\n\nDuring the six balls of the 10th over India scored 0, 0, 0, 1 (from a no ball), loss of wicket, 0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC2003/SCORECARDS/FINALS/AUS_IND_WC2003_ODI-FINAL_23MAR2003_BBB-COMMS.html|title=Final: Australia v India at Johannesburg Ball-by-Ball Commentary|date=23 March 2003|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media}}</ref> At the start of the over India were ahead of the par score, but the loss of the wicket caused their par score to jump from 55 to 79, which put them behind the par score.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: center; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Overs used\n! style=\"border-style:solid;border-color:white;\" rowspan=\"9\" width=\"50pt\" | \n! style=\"border-width:0 0 0 3px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey;background:#ffdead;\" colspan=\"4\" width=\"100pt\" | 1 wicket lost\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | 2 wickets lost\n! style=\"border-style:solid;border-color:white;\" rowspan=\"9\" width=\"50pt\" | \n! style=\"border-width:0 0 0 3px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey;background:#ffdead;\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"100pt\" | India's actual score\n|-\n| width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''Resources remaining''' || width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''Resources used (R2)''' || width=\"100pt\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''D/L par score''' || width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''Resources remaining''' || width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''Resources used (R2)''' || width=\"100pt\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''D/L par score''' \n|-\n| 9.0 || 85.3% || 14.7% || width=\"60pt\" | 52.773 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" width=\"40pt\" | 52 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.7% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.3% || width=\"60pt\" style=\"color:grey;\" | 76.467 || width=\"40pt\" style=\"color:grey;\" | 76 || 57-1\n|-\n| 9.1 || 85.1% || 14.9% || 53.491 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 53 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.5% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.5% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 77.185 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 77 || 57-1\n|-\n| 9.2 || 84.9% || 15.1% || 54.209 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 54 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.4% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.6% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 77.544 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 77 || 57-1\n|-\n| 9.3 || 84.7% || 15.3% || 54.927 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 54 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.2% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.8% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.262 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78 || 57-1\n|-\n| 9.4 || 84.6% || 15.4% || 55.286 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 55 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.1% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.9% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.621 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78 || 58-1\n|-\n| 9.5 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 84.4% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 15.6% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 56.004 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 56 || 77.9% || 22.1% || 79.339 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 79 || 58-2\n|-\n| 10.0 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 84.2% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 15.8% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 56.722 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 56 || 77.8% || 22.2% || 79.698 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 79 || 58-2\n|}\n\n==Other uses==\n\nThere are uses of the D/L method other than finding the current official final target score for the team batting second in a match that has already been reduced by the weather.\n\n===Ball-by-ball par score===\n\n[[File:Lords scoreboard.jpg|thumb|300px|Scoreboard showing ball-by-ball D/L Par Score.]]\n\n[[File:2015 CWC I v UAE 02-28 Scoreboard (02).JPG|thumb|Many stadium scoreboards do not carry information about par scores during games]]\n\nDuring the second team's innings, the number of runs a chasing side would expect to have scored on average with this number of overs used and wickets lost, if they were going to successfully match the first team's score, called the D/L par score, may be shown on a computer printout, the scoreboard and/or TV alongside the actual score, and updated after every ball.

The DLS method is an attempt to set a statistically fair target for the second team's innings, which is the same difficulty as the original target. The basic principle is that each team in a limited-overs match has two resources available with which to score runs (overs to play and wickets remaining), and the target is adjusted proportionally to the change in the combination of these two resources.\n\n==History and creation==\nVarious different methods had been used previously to resolve rain-affected cricket games, with the most common being the [[Average Run Rate method]] and the [[Most Productive Overs method]]. \n\nThese earlier methods, while simple in nature, had intrinsic flaws that meant they produced unfair revised targets that altered the balance of the match, and were easily exploitable:\n* The Average Run Rate method took no account of how many wickets were lost by the team batting second, but simply reflected how quickly they were scoring when the match was interrupted. So, if a team felt a rain stoppage was likely, they could attempt to force the scoring rate without regard for the corresponding highly likely loss of wickets, skewing the comparison with the first team. \n* The Most Productive Overs method also took no account of wickets lost by the team batting second, and effectively penalised the team batting second for good bowling by ignoring their best overs in setting the revised target.\n\n[[File:India Vs New zealand One day International, 10 December 2010 (6159936713).jpg|thumb|D/L began in [[one-day international]]s]]\n\nThe D/L method was devised by two British [[statistician]]s, [[Frank Duckworth]] and [[Tony Lewis (mathematician)|Tony Lewis]], as a result of the outcome to the semi-final in the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]] between England and South Africa, where the ''Most Productive Overs'' method was used.

Each team is taken to have two 'resources' to use to score as many runs as possible: the number of [[over (cricket)|over]]s they have to receive; and the number of [[Dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] they have in hand. At any point in any [[innings]], a team's ability to score more runs depends on the combination of these two resources they have left. Looking at historical scores, there is a very close correspondence between the availability of these resources and a team's final score, a correspondence which D/L exploits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daa.com.au/analytical-ideas/cricket/|title=The Duckworth-Lewis Method|publisher=Data Analysis Australia|date=September 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:(Duckworth Lewis) method of adjusting target scores.PNG|thumb|300px|A published table of resource remaining percentages, for all combinations of wickets lost and whole overs left]]\n\nThe D/L method converts all possible combinations of overs (or, more accurately, balls) and wickets left into a combined resources remaining [[percentage]] figure (with 50 overs and 10 wickets = 100%), and these are all stored in a published table or computer. The target score for the team batting second ('Team 2') can be adjusted up or down from the total the team batting first ('Team 1') achieved using these resource percentages, to reflect the loss of resources to one or both teams when a match is shortened one or more times.\n\nIn the version of D/L most commonly in use in international and [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches (the 'Professional Edition'), the target for Team 2 is adjusted simply in [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] to the two teams' resources, i.e.\n\n: <math>\\text{Team 2's par score }=\\text{ Team 1's score} \\times \\frac{\\text{Team 2's resources}}{\\text{Team 1's resources}}.</math>\n\nIf, as usually occurs, this 'par score' is a non-[[integer]] number of runs, then Team 2's target to win is this number rounded up to the next integer, and the score to [[The result in cricket#Tie|tie]] (also called the par score), is this number rounded down to the preceding integer. If Team 2 reaches or passes the target score, then they have won the match. If the match ends when Team 2 has exactly met (but not passed) the par score then the match is a tie. If Team 2 fail to reach the par score then they have lost.\n\nFor example, if a rain delay means that Team 2 only has 90% of resources available, and Team 1 scored 254 with 100% of resources available, then 254&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;90%&nbsp;/&nbsp;100%&nbsp;=&nbsp;228.6, so Team 2's target is 229, and the score to tie is 228. The actual resource values used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available,<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ABOUT_CRICKET/RAIN_RULES/DL_FAQ.html|title=D/L method: answers to frequently asked questions|author1=Frank Duckworth|author2=Tony Lewis|work=Crickinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|date=December 2008}}</ref> so a computer which has this software loaded must be used.\n\nIf it is a 50-over match and Team 1 completed its innings uninterrupted, then they had 100% resource available to them, so the formula simplifies to:\n\n: <math>\\text{Team 2's par score }=\\text{ Team 1's score} \\times \\text{Team 2's resources}. </math>\n\n===Summary of impact on Team 2's target===\n*If there is a delay before the first innings starts, so that the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced but still the same as each other, then D/L makes no change to the target score, because both sides are aware of the total number of overs and wickets throughout their innings, thus they will have the same resources available.\n*Team 2's target score is first calculated once Team 1's innings has finished.\n*If there were interruption(s) during Team 1's innings, or Team 1's innings was cut short, so the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced (but still the same as each other), then D/L will adjust Team 2's target score as described above. The adjustment to Team 2's target after interruptions in Team 1's innings is often an increase, implying that Team 2 has more resource available than Team 1 had. Although both teams have 10 wickets and the same (reduced) number of overs available, an increase is fair as, for some of their innings, Team 1 ''thought'' they would have more overs available than they actually ended up having. If Team 1 had known that their innings was going to be shorter, they would have batted less conservatively, and scored more runs (at the expense of more wickets). They saved some wicket resource to use up in the overs that ended up being cancelled, which Team 2 does not need to do, therefore Team 2 ''does'' have more resource to use in the same number of overs. Therefore, increasing Team 2's target score compensates Team 1 for the denial of some of the overs they thought they would get to bat. The increased target is what D/L thinks Team 1 would have scored in the overs it ended up having, if it had known throughout that the innings would be only as long as it was.\n:For example, if Team 1 batted for 20 overs before rain came, thinking they would have 50 overs in total, but at the re-start there was only time for Team 2 to bat for 20 overs, it would clearly be unfair to give Team 2 the target that Team 1 achieved, as Team 1 would have batted less conservatively and scored more runs, if they had known they would only have the 20 overs.\n*If there are interruption(s) to Team 2's innings, either before it starts, during, or it is cut short, then D/L will reduce Team 2's target score from the initial target set at the end of Team 1's innings, in proportion to the reduction in Team 2's resources. If there are multiple interruptions in the second innings, the target will be adjusted downwards each time.\n*If there are interruptions which both increase and decrease the target score, then the net effect on the target could be either an increase or decrease, depending on which interruptions were bigger.\n\n===Mathematical theory===\nThe original D/L model started by assuming that the number of runs that can still be scored (called <math>Z</math>), for a given number of overs remaining (called <math>u</math>) and wickets lost (called <math>w</math>), takes the following [[exponential decay]] relationship:<ref name=OrigPaper>{{Cite journal |last1=Duckworth |first1=FC |last2=Lewis|first2= AJ |year=1998 |title=A fair method for resetting the target in interrupted one-day cricket matches |journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=220\u2013227 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600524 |citeseerx=10.1.1.180.3272 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>Z(u,w) = Z_0(w)\\left({1 - e^{-b(w)u} } \\right),</math>\n\nwhere the constant <math>Z_0</math> is the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] average total score in unlimited overs (under one-day rules), and <math>b</math> is the exponential decay constant. Both vary with <math>w</math> (only).

When it was introduced, it was necessary that D/L could be implemented with a single table of\nresource percentages, as it could not be guaranteed that computers would be present. Therefore, this single formula was used giving average resources. This method relies on the assumption that average performance is proportional to the mean, irrespective of the actual score. This was good enough in 95 per cent of matches, but in the 5 per cent of matches with very high scores, the simple approach started to break down.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Duckworth |first=Frank |year=2008 |title=The Duckworth/Lewis method: an exercise in Maths, Stats, OR and communications |journal=MSOR Connections |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=11\u201314 |url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/msor.8.3d.pdf |publisher=HE Academy|doi=10.11120/msor.2008.08030011 }}</ref> To overcome the problem, an upgraded formula was proposed with an additional parameter whose value depends on the Team 1 innings.<ref name=SecondPaper>{{Cite journal |last=Duckworth |first=FC |last2=Lewis|first2= AJ |year=2004 |title=A successful Operational Research intervention in one-day cricket |journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society |volume=55 |issue=7 |pages=749\u2013759 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601717 |pmid= |bibcode= |ref=}}</ref> This became the Professional Edition.\n\n==Examples==\n===Stoppage in first innings===\n====Increased target====\nIn the 4th [[Indian Cricket Team|India]] \u2013 [[England cricket team|England]] ODI in the 2008 series, the first innings was interrupted by rain on two occasions, resulting in the match being reduced to 22 overs each. India (batting first) made 166/4. England's target was set by the D/L method at 198 from 22 overs. As England ''knew'' they had only 22 overs the expectation is that they will be able to score more runs from those overs than India had from their (interrupted) innings. England made 178/8 from 22 overs, and so the match was listed as \"India won by 19 runs (D/L method)\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-eap.cricinfo.com/indveng/engine/current/match/361046.html |work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|title=Full Scoreboard of India vs England 4th ODI 2008|date=23 November 2008}}</ref>\n\nDuring the fifth ODI between India and South Africa in January 2011, rain halted play twice during the first innings.

Pakistan, batting second, were 311/7 when bad light stopped play after the 47th over. Pakistan's target, had the match continued, was 18 runs in 18 balls, with three wickets in hand. Considering the overall scoring rate throughout the match, this is a target most teams would be favoured to achieve. And indeed, application of the D/L method resulted in a retrospective target score of 305 (or par score of 304) at the end of the 47th over, with the result therefore officially listed as \"Pakistan won by 7 runs (D/L Method)\".\n\nThe D/L method was used in the group stage match between [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] at the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20#Group B|20/20 World Cup in 2010]]. Sri Lanka scored 173/7 in 20 overs batting first, and in reply Zimbabwe were 4/0 from 1 over when rain interrupted play. At the restart Zimbabwe's target was reduced to 108 from 12 overs, but rain stopped the match when they had scored 29/1 from 5 overs.

This match was frequently interrupted by rain in the final overs, and a ball-by-ball calculation of the Duckworth\u2013Lewis 'par' score played a key role in tactical decisions during those overs. At one point, India were leading under D/L during one rain delay, and would have won if play had not resumed. At a second rain interval, England, who had scored some quick runs (knowing they needed to get ahead in D/L terms) would correspondingly have won if play had not resumed. Play was finally called off with just 7 balls of the match remaining and England's score equal to the Duckworth\u2013Lewis 'par' score, therefore resulting in a tie.\n\nThis example does show how crucial (and difficult) the decisions of the umpires can be, in assessing when rain is heavy enough to justify ceasing play. If the umpires of that match had halted play one ball earlier, England would have been ahead on D/L, and so would have won the match. Equally, if play had stopped one ball later, India could have won the match with a [[dot ball]] \u2013 indicating how finely-tuned D/L calculations can be in such situations.\n\n===Stoppages in both innings===\nDuring the [[2012\u201313 Big Bash League season#Knockout stage 2|2012/13 KFC Big Bash League]], D/L was used in the 2nd semi-final played between the [[Melbourne Stars]] and the [[Perth Scorchers]]. After rain delayed the start of the match, it interrupted Melbourne's innings when they had scored 159/1 off 15.2 overs, and both innings were reduced by 2 overs to 18, and Melbourne finished on 183/2. After a further rain delay reduced Perth's innings to 17 overs, Perth returned to the field to face 13 overs, with a revised target of 139.

Tony Lewis noticed that there was an inherent weakness in the formula that would give a noticeable advantage to the side chasing a total in excess of 350. A correction was built into the formula and the software, but was not fully adopted until 2004. One-day matches were achieving significantly higher scores than in previous decades, affecting the historical relationship between resources and runs. The second version uses more sophisticated statistical modelling, but does not use a single table of resource percentages. Instead, the percentages also vary with score, so a computer is required.<ref name=FAQ/> Therefore, it loses some of the previous advantages of transparency and simplicity.\n\nIn 2002 the resource percentages were revised, following an extensive analysis of limited overs matches, and there was a change to the [[Duckworth\u2013Lewis method#Step 2. Convert the two teams.27 batting resources into Team 2.27s target score|G50]] for ODIs. (G50 is the average score expected from the team batting first in an uninterrupted 50 overs-per-innings match.)

Find the batting resources available to each team===\n\nAfter each reduction in overs, the new total batting resources available to the two teams are found, using figures for the total amount of batting resources ''remaining'' for any combination of overs and wickets. While the process for converting these resources remaining figures into total resource available figures is the same in the two Editions, this can be done manually in the Standard Edition, as the resource remaining figures are published in a reference table.<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/> However, the resource remaining figures used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available,<ref name=FAQ/> so a computer must be used which has the software loaded.\n\n*If a team loses resource at the ''start'' of an innings (left hand image below), then this is simple. For example, if the first 20 overs of an innings are lost, then 30 overs and 10 wickets are remaining, which is 75.1% in the Standard Edition, so this is the resource available.\n*If a team loses resource at the ''end'' of its innings (centre image below), then the resource that was available to that team is found by taking the resources it had at the start, and [[subtraction|subtracting]] the resources remaining at the point the innings was ended. For example, if a team starts with 50 overs and 10 wickets (100% of its resources), but its innings is ended with 20 overs and 8 wickets remaining (52.4% of its resources), then the resources it actually used is 100% &minus; 52.4% = 47.6%.\n*If a team loses resource in the ''middle'' of its innings (right hand image below), then the resource that was available to that team is found by taking the resources it had at the start, and subtracting the resources remaining at the point the innings was interrupted (to give the resources used in the first period of the innings), then adding on the resource remaining at the restart. For example, if a team starts with 50 overs and 10 wickets (100% of its resources), but is interrupted when it still has 40 overs and 8 wickets remaining (77.8% of its resources), and restarted when it has 20 overs and 8 wickets remaining (52.4% of its resources), then the resources it actually used is 100% &minus; 77.8% + 52.4% = 74.6%. Another way of looking at this is to say it lost the resources available between 40 overs and 8 wickets (77.8%) and 20 overs and 8 wickets (52.4%), i.e. 77.8% &minus; 52.4% = 25.4%, so its total resource available was 100% &minus; 25.4% = 74.6%.\n\n'''[[File:DuckworthLewisDiag1.png|300px|DuckworthLewisDiag1]]''' \n[[File:DuckworthLewisDiag2.png|330px|DuckworthLewisDiag2]] \n[[File:DuckworthLewisDiag3.png|360px|DuckworthLewisDiag3]]\n\nThese are just the different ways of having one interruption. With multiple interruptions possible, it may seem like finding the total resource percentage requires a different calculation for each different scenario. However, the formula is actually the same each time &minus; it's just that different scenarios, with more or less interruptions and restarts, need to use more or less of the same formula. The total resources available to a team are given by:<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/>\n\n<!--<div style=\"background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 2px;\">-->\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 0); padding: 2px;\">\n{|\n|-\n|Total resources available = 100% &minus; Resources lost by 1st interruption &minus; Resources lost by 2nd interruption &minus; Resources lost by 3rd interruption &minus; ...\n|}\n</div>\n\nwhich can alternatively be written as:\n\n<!--<div style=\"background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 2px;\">-->\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 0); padding: 2px;\">\n{|\n|-\n|Total resources available = 100% &minus; Resources remaining at 1st interruption + Resources remaining at 1st restart &minus; Resources remaining at 2nd interruption + Resources remaining at 2nd restart &minus; Resources remaining at 3rd interruption + Resources remaining at 3rd restart &minus; ...\n|}\n</div>\n\nEach time there's an interruption or a restart after an interruption, the resource remaining percentages at those times (obtained from a reference table for the Standard Edition, or from a computer for the Professional Edition) can be entered into the formula, with the rest left blank. Note that a delay at the start of an innings counts as the 1st interruption.\n\n===Step 2. Convert the two teams' batting resources into Team 2's target score===\n\n'''Standard Edition'''\n\n*If R2&nbsp;<&nbsp;R1, reduce Team 2's target score in proportion to the reduction in total resources, i.e. '''S&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;R2/R1'''.\n*If R2&nbsp;=&nbsp;R1, no adjustment to Team 2's target score is needed.\n*If R2&nbsp;>&nbsp;R1, increase Team 2's target score by the extra runs that could be expected to be scored on average with the extra total resource, i.e. '''S&nbsp;+&nbsp;G50&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;(R2&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;R1)/100''', where G50 is the average 50-over total. Team 2's target score is not simply increased in proportion to the increase in total resources, i.e. S&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;R2/R1, as this 'could lead to some unrealistically high targets if Team 1 had achieved an early high rate of scoring [in the [[Powerplay (cricket)|powerplay]] overs] and rain caused a drastic reduction in the overs for the match.'<ref name=FAQ/> Instead, D/L Standard Edition requires average performance for Team 2's additional resource over Team 1.\n\n'''G50'''\n\nG50 is the average score expected from the team batting first in an uninterrupted 50 overs-per-innings match. This will vary with the level of competition and over time. The annual ICC Playing Handbook<ref name=\"ICCPH\"/> gives the values of G50 to be used each year when the D/L Standard Edition is applied:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| width=\"160pt\" align=\"center\" | Period \n| width=\"180pt\" align=\"center\" | Matches involving [[List of International Cricket Council members#Full Members|ICC full member nations]]\n| width=\"180pt\" align=\"center\" | Matches between teams that play [[first-class cricket]]\n| width=\"100pt\" align=\"center\" | Under-19 internationals\n| width=\"100pt\" align=\"center\" | Under-15 internationals\n| width=\"180pt\" align=\"center\" | Matches between [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate Members|ICC associate member nations]]\n| width=\"100pt\" align=\"center\" | [[Women's One Day International cricket|Women's ODIs]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1999 &minus; 31 August 2002<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/1999/sep/16guest.htm|title= The dummy's guide to Duckworth-Lewis|author=Dr Srinivas Bhogle|date=16 September 1999|work=Rediff on the Net}}</ref>\n| rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |225\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | ?\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1 September 2002 &minus; 2006<ref name=\"DLM2002\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/page/409996.html |title=The Duckworth-Lewis Method (2002)| author1=Frank Duckworth|author2=Tony Lewis|year=2002|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media}}</ref>\n| rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |235\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2006/07<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toxovolia.com/downloads/cricket/ICC%20HB%20E-Book2.pdf|title=ICC Playing Handbook 2006-07|access-date=18 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224031/http://www.toxovolia.com/downloads/cricket/ICC%20HB%20E-Book2.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |235\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" | 200\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" | 190\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" | 175\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2007/08\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2008/09<ref name=\"ICCPH\"/>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2009/10<ref name=\"ICCPH\"/>\n| rowspan=\"5\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |245\n| rowspan=\"5\" colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |200\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2010/11<ref name=\"ICCPH\"/>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2011/12<ref name=\"ICCPH\"/>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2012/13<ref name=\"ICCPH\"/>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2013/14<ref name=\"ICCPH\"/>\n|}\n\nDuckworth and Lewis write, 'We accept that the value of G50, perhaps, should be different for each country, or even for each ground, and there is no reason why any cricket authority may not choose the value it believes to be the most appropriate. In fact it would be possible for the two captains to agree a value of G50 before the start of each match, taking account of all relevant factors. However, we do not believe that something that is only invoked if rain interferes with the game should impose itself on every game in this way. In any case, it should be realised that the value of G50 usually has very little effect on the revised target. If 250 were used, for instance, instead of 235, it is unlikely that the target would be more than two or three runs different.'<ref name=FAQ/>\n\n'''Professional Edition'''\n\n*If R2&nbsp;<&nbsp;R1, reduce Team 2's target score in proportion to the reduction in total resources, i.e. '''S&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;R2/R1'''.\n*If R2&nbsp;=&nbsp;R1, no adjustment to Team 2's target score is needed.\n*If R2&nbsp;>&nbsp;R1, increase Team 2's target score in proportion to the increase in total resources, i.e. '''S&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;R2/R1'''. The problem of early high scoring rates potentially producing anomalously high targets has been overcome in the Professional Edition, which is essentially 'a different table of resource percentages for every total score in the Team 1 innings.'<ref name=FAQ/> Therefore, Team 2's target score can be simply increased in proportion to the increase in total resources when R2&nbsp;>&nbsp;R1,<ref name=FAQ/> and there is no G50.\n\n===Example Standard Edition Target score calculations===\nAs the resource percentages used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available, it is difficult to give examples of the D/L calculation for the Professional Edition.

It is fair that their target was increased, even though they had the same number of overs to bat as Australia, as Australia would have batted less conservatively in their first 28 overs, and scored more runs at the expense of more wickets, if they had known that their innings would only be 36 overs long. Increasing the Netherlands' target score neutralises the injustice done to Australia when they were denied some of the overs to bat they thought they would get. The Netherlands were all out for 122, giving Australia victory by 197 &minus; 122 = 75 runs.\n\nThis formula for Netherlands' par score comes from the Standard Edition of D/L, which was used at the time. Currently the Professional Edition is used, which has a different formula when R2>R1. The formula required Netherlands to match Australia's performance with their overlapping 72.6% of resource (i.e. score 170 runs), and achieve average performance with their extra 84.1% &minus; 72.6% = 11.5% of resource (i.e. score 11.5% of G50 (235 at the time) = 27.025 runs).\n\nAfter the match there were reports in the media<ref name=\"AusNedReport\"/> that Australia had batted conservatively in their final 8 overs after the final restart, to avoid losing wickets rather than maximising their numbers of runs, in belief that this would further increase the Netherlands' par score. However, if this is true, this belief was mistaken, in the same way that conserving wickets rather than maximising runs in the final 8 overs of a full 50-over innings would be a mistake. At that point the amount of resource available to each team was fixed (as long as there were no further rain interruptions), so the only undetermined number in the formula for Netherlands' par score was Australia's final score, so they should have tried to maximise this.\n\nAs Australia's innings was interrupted three times (once before it started) and restarted three times, their resource is given by the general formula above as follows:\n\nTotal resources available = 100% &minus; Resources remaining at 1st interruption + Resources remaining at 1st restart &minus; Resources remaining at 2nd interruption + Resources remaining at 2nd restart &minus; Resources remaining at 3rd interruption + Resources remaining at 3rd restart = 100% &minus; 100% + 97.1% &minus; 55.8% + 50.5% &minus; 44.7% + 25.5% = 72.6%.\n\n==In-game strategy==\n===During team 1's innings===\n====Strategy for team 1====\nDuring Team 1's innings, the target score calculations (as described above), have not yet been made.\n\nThe objective of the team batting first is to maximise the target score which will be calculated for the team batting second, which (in the Professional Edition) will be determined by the formula:\n\n<math>\\text{Team 2's par score }=\\text{ Team 1's score} \\times \\frac{\\text{Team 2's resources}}{\\text{Team 1's resources}}.</math>\n\nFor these three terms:\n*'''Team 1's score''': Team 1 will always increase Team 2's target by increasing their own score. \n*At the start of Team 2's innings, '''Team 2's resources''' will be 10 wickets and the number of overs available, and Team 1 cannot affect this.\n*'''Team 1's resources''' are given by:\n\n<!--<div style=\"background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 2px;\">-->\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 0); padding: 2px;\">\n{|\n|-\n|Total resources available = 100% &minus; Resources lost by 1st interruption &minus; Resources lost by 2nd interruption &minus; Resources lost by 3rd interruption &minus; ...\n|}\n</div>\n\nIf there will not be any future interruptions to Team 1's innings, then the amount of resource available to them is now fixed (whether there have been interruptions so far or not), so the only thing Team 1 can do to increase Team 2's target is increase their own score, ignoring how many wickets they lose (as in a normal unaffected match).\n\nHowever, if there will be future interruptions to Team 1's innings, then an alternative strategy to scoring more runs is minimising the amount of resource they use before the coming interruption (i.e. preserving wickets). While the best overall strategy is obviously to both score more runs ''and'' preserve resources, if a choice has to be made between the two, sometimes preserving wickets at the expense of scoring runs ('conservative' batting) is a more effective way of increasing Team 2's target, and sometimes the reverse ('aggressive' batting) is true.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center; width:25%;\"\n|+ Percentage total resources remaining reference table (D/L Standard Edition)<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Overs remaining\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Wickets in hand\n|-\n| '''10''' || '''8''' || '''6''' || '''4''' || '''2''' \n|-\n| '''50''' || 100.0 || 85.1 || 62.7 || 34.9 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''40''' || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 89.3 || 77.8 || 59.5 || 34.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''30''' || 75.1 || 67.3 || 54.1 || 33.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''20''' || 56.6 || 52.4 || 44.6 || 30.8 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''10''' || 32.1 || 30.8 || 28.3 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 22.8 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 11.4 \n|-\n| '''5''' || 17.2 || 16.8 || 16.1 || 14.3 || 9.4 \n|}\n\nFor example, suppose Team 1 has been batting without interruptions, but thinks the innings will be cut short at 40 overs, i.e. with 10 overs left. (Then Team 2 will have 40 overs to bat, so Team 2's resource will be 89.3%.) Team 1 thinks by batting conservatively it can reach 200\u20136, or by batting aggressively it can reach 220\u20138:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Batting strategy\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Conservative\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Aggressive\n|-\n| Runs Team 1 thinks it can score\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 220 \n|-\n| Wickets Team 1 thinks it will have in hand\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n|-\n| Resource remaining to Team 1 at cut-off\n| align=\"center\" | 22.8%\n| align=\"center\" | 11.4%\n|-\n| Resource used by Team 1\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 22.8% = 77.2%\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 11.4% = 88.6%\n|-\n| Team 2's par score\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | 200 + 250 x (89.3% - 77.2%) <br />= '''230.25 runs'''\n| align=\"center\" | 220 + 250 x (89.3% - 88.6%) <br />= '''221.75 runs'''\n|}\n\nTherefore, in this case, the conservative strategy achieves a higher target for Team 2.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center; width:25%;\"\n|+ Percentage total resources remaining reference table (D/L Standard Edition)<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Overs remaining\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Wickets in hand\n|-\n| '''10''' || '''8''' || '''6''' || '''4''' || '''2''' \n|-\n| '''50''' || 100.0 || 85.1 || 62.7 || 34.9 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''40''' || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 89.3 || 77.8 || 59.5 || 34.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''30''' || 75.1 || 67.3 || 54.1 || 33.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''20''' || 56.6 || 52.4 || 44.6 || 30.8 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''10''' || 32.1 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 30.8 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 28.3 || 22.8 || 11.4 \n|-\n| '''5''' || 17.2 || 16.8 || 16.1 || 14.3 || 9.4 \n|}\n\nHowever, suppose instead that the difference between the two strategies is scoring 200\u20132 or 220\u20134:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Batting strategy\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Conservative\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Aggressive\n|-\n| Runs Team 1 thinks it can score\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 220 \n|-\n| Wickets Team 1 thinks it will have in hand\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n|-\n| Resource remaining to Team 1 at cut-off\n| align=\"center\" | 30.8%\n| align=\"center\" | 28.3%\n|-\n| Resource used by Team 1\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 30.8% = 69.2%\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 28.3% = 71.7%\n|-\n| Team 2's par score\n| align=\"center\" | 200 + 250 x (89.3% - 69.2%) <br />= '''250.25 runs'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | 220 + 250 x (89.3% - 71.7%) <br />= '''264.00 runs'''\n|}\n\nIn this case, the aggressive strategy is better.\n\nTherefore, the best batting strategy for Team 1 ahead of a coming interruption is not always the same, but varies with the [[facts]] of the match situation to date (runs scored, wickets lost, overs used, and whether there have been interruptions), and also with the [[opinions]] about what will happen with each strategy (how many further runs will be scored, further wickets will be lost, and further overs will be used? How likely are the coming interruptions, when will they happen, and how long will they last \u2013 will Team 1's innings be restarted?).\n\nThis example shows just two possible batting strategies, but in reality there could be a range of others, e.g. 'neutral', 'semi-aggressive', 'super-aggressive', or [[timewasting]] to minimise the amount of resource used by slowing the over rate. Finding which strategy is the best can only be found by inputting the facts and one's opinions into the calculations and seeing what emerges.\n\nOf course, a chosen strategy may backfire. For example, if Team 1 chooses to bat conservatively, Team 2 may see this and decide to attack (rather than focus on saving runs), and Team 1 may both fail to score many more runs ''and'' lose wickets.\n\nIf there have already been interruptions to Team 1's innings, the calculation of total resource they use will be more complicated than this example.\n\n====Strategy for team 2====\nDuring Team 1's innings, Team 2's objective is to minimise the target score they will be set. This is achieved by minimising Team 1's score, or (as above), if there will be future interruptions to Team 1's innings, alternatively by maximising the resource used by Team 1 (i.e. wickets lost or overs bowled) before that happens. Team 2 can vary their bowling strategy (between conservative and aggressive) to try and achieve either of these objectives, so this means doing the same calculations as above, inputting their opinions of future runs conceded, wickets taken and overs bowled in each bowling strategy, to see which one is best.\n\nAlso, Team 2 can encourage Team 1 to bat particularly conservatively or aggressively (e.g. through [[Fielding (cricket)#Tactics of field placement|field settings]]).\n\n===During team 2's innings===\nA target (from a given number of overs) is set for Team 2 at the start of its innings. If there will not be any future interruptions, then both sides can play to a finish in the normal way. However, if there are likely to be interruptions to Team 2's innings, then Team 2 will aim to keep itself ahead of the D/L par score, and Team 1 will aim to keep them behind it. This is because, if a match is abandoned before the given number of overs is complete, Team 2 is declared the winner if they're ahead of the par score, and Team 1 is declared the winner if Team 2 are behind the par score. A tie is declared if Team 2 are exactly on the par score. (This is provided a minimum number of overs has been bowled in Team 2's innings.)\n\nThe par score increases with every ball bowled and every wicket lost, as the amount of resource used increases. As an example, in the [[2003 Cricket World Cup Final]] Australia batted first and scored 359 from 50 overs. As Australia completed their 50 overs, their total resources used R1=100%, so India's par score throughout their innings was: 359 x R2/100%, where R2 is the amount of resource used to that point. As shown in the first line of the table below, after 9 overs India were 57-1, and 41 overs and 9 wickets remaining equates to 85.3% of resources, so 100% &minus; 85.3% = 14.7% had been used. India's par score after 9 overs was therefore 359 x 14.7%/100% = 52.773, which is rounded down to 52.\n\nDuring the six balls of the 10th over India scored 0, 0, 0, 1 (from a no ball), loss of wicket, 0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC2003/SCORECARDS/FINALS/AUS_IND_WC2003_ODI-FINAL_23MAR2003_BBB-COMMS.html|title=Final: Australia v India at Johannesburg Ball-by-Ball Commentary|date=23 March 2003|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media}}</ref> At the start of the over India were ahead of the par score, but the loss of the wicket caused their par score to jump from 55 to 79, which put them behind the par score.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: center; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Overs used\n! style=\"border-style:solid;border-color:white;\" rowspan=\"9\" width=\"50pt\" | \n! style=\"border-width:0 0 0 3px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey;background:#ffdead;\" colspan=\"4\" width=\"100pt\" | 1 wicket lost\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | 2 wickets lost\n! style=\"border-style:solid;border-color:white;\" rowspan=\"9\" width=\"50pt\" | \n! style=\"border-width:0 0 0 3px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey;background:#ffdead;\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"100pt\" | India's actual score\n|-\n| width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''Resources remaining''' || width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''Resources used (R2)''' || width=\"100pt\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''D/L par score''' || width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''Resources remaining''' || width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''Resources used (R2)''' || width=\"100pt\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''D/L par score''' \n|-\n| 9.0 || 85.3% || 14.7% || width=\"60pt\" | 52.773 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" width=\"40pt\" | 52 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.7% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.3% || width=\"60pt\" style=\"color:grey;\" | 76.467 || width=\"40pt\" style=\"color:grey;\" | 76 || 57-1\n|-\n| 9.1 || 85.1% || 14.9% || 53.491 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 53 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.5% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.5% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 77.185 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 77 || 57-1\n|-\n| 9.2 || 84.9% || 15.1% || 54.209 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 54 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.4% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.6% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 77.544 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 77 || 57-1\n|-\n| 9.3 || 84.7% || 15.3% || 54.927 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 54 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.2% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.8% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.262 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78 || 57-1\n|-\n| 9.4 || 84.6% || 15.4% || 55.286 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 55 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.1% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.9% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.621 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78 || 58-1\n|-\n| 9.5 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 84.4% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 15.6% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 56.004 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 56 || 77.9% || 22.1% || 79.339 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 79 || 58-2\n|-\n| 10.0 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 84.2% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 15.8% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 56.722 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 56 || 77.8% || 22.2% || 79.698 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 79 || 58-2\n|}\n\n==Other uses==\n\nThere are uses of the D/L method other than finding the current official final target score for the team batting second in a match that has already been reduced by the weather.\n\n===Ball-by-ball par score===\n\n[[File:Lords scoreboard.jpg|thumb|300px|Scoreboard showing ball-by-ball D/L Par Score.]]\n\n[[File:2015 CWC I v UAE 02-28 Scoreboard (02).JPG|thumb|Many stadium scoreboards do not carry information about par scores during games]]\n\nDuring the second team's innings, the number of runs a chasing side would expect to have scored on average with this number of overs used and wickets lost, if they were going to successfully match the first team's score, called the D/L par score, may be shown on a computer printout, the scoreboard and/or TV alongside the actual score, and updated after every ball.
