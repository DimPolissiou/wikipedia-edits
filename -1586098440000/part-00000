Groups included [[Wretched (punk band)|Wretched]], [[Raw Power (band)|Raw Power]], and [[Negazione]]. The [[Last White Christmas]] festival, held in Pisa on Dec. 4, 1983, was an important concert for Italian groups (CCM, I Refuse It!, Raw Power, Purid Fever, War Dogs). Sweden developed several influential hardcore bands, including [[Mob 47]] and [[Anti Cimex]], whose music has also inspired many foreign bands. Since the early 1990s, many Swedish groups were [[D-beat]] \"tribute bands\" to groups such as UK's Discharge. A hardcore scene that emerged in [[Ume\u00e5]] and other northern cities in the 1990s, with bands such as [[Refused]] (Ume\u00e5) and [[Raised Fist]] ([[Lule\u00e5]]). Finland produced some influential hardcore bands, including [[Terveet K\u00e4det]], one of the first hardcore groups to emerge in the country. In Eastern Europe notable hardcore bands included Hungaria's [[Galloping Coroners]] from 1975, Yugoslavia's 1980s-era [[Niet]] from Ljubljana, [[KUD Idijoti]] from [[Pula]], and [[KBO!]].\n\nIn Brazil, the hardcore scene was jump started with the opening of a punk record shop called ''Punk Rock Discos'' in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1979. By the early 1980s, the store was bringing records from British bands like [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[Disorder (band)|Disorder]] as well as Swedish and Finnish hardcore. Around 1981, punk gigs were happening often around S\u00e3o Paulo, where there were already dozens of active bands, mostly playing hardcore punk and similar styles, most importantly [[C\u00f3lera]] and [[Inocentes]].\n\nA [[Japanese hardcore]] scene arose to protest the social and economic changes sweeping the country in the late 1970s and during the 1980s.

Inspired by UK bands such as [[Crass (band)|Crass]] and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], many Italian groups had lyrics that were anti-war and anti-[[NATO]]. Groups included [[Wretched (punk band)|Wretched]], [[Raw Power (band)|Raw Power]], and [[Negazione]]. The [[Last White Christmas]] festival, held in Pisa on Dec. 4, 1983, was an important concert for Italian groups (CCM, I Refuse It!, Raw Power, Purid Fever, War Dogs). Sweden developed several influential hardcore bands, including [[Mob 47]] and [[Anti Cimex]], whose music has also inspired many foreign bands. Since the early 1990s, many Swedish groups were [[D-beat]] \"tribute bands\" to groups such as UK's Discharge. A hardcore scene that emerged in [[Ume\u00e5]] and other northern cities in the 1990s, with bands such as [[Refused]] (Ume\u00e5) and [[Raised Fist]] ([[Lule\u00e5]]). Finland produced some influential hardcore bands, including [[Terveet K\u00e4det]], one of the first hardcore groups to emerge in the country. In Eastern Europe notable hardcore bands included Hungaria's [[Galloping Coroners]] from 1975, Yugoslavia's 1980s-era [[Niet]] from Ljubljana, [[KUD Idijoti]] from [[Pula]], and [[KBO!]].\n\nIn Brazil, the hardcore scene was jump started with the opening of a punk record shop called ''Punk Rock Discos'' in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1979. By the early 1980s, the store was bringing records from British bands like [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[Disorder (band)|Disorder]] as well as Swedish and Finnish hardcore. Around 1981, punk gigs were happening often around S\u00e3o Paulo, where there were already dozens of active bands, mostly playing hardcore punk and similar styles, most importantly [[C\u00f3lera]] and [[Inocentes]].\n\nA [[Japanese hardcore]] scene arose to protest the social and economic changes sweeping the country in the late 1970s and during the 1980s.
