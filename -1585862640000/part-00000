It is the fourth most populous city in the U.S. state of New York, behind [[New York City]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]. The population of Yonkers was 195,976 as enumerated in the [[2010 United States Census]] and is estimated to have increased by 2.5% to 199,663 in 2018.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> It is an [[inner suburb]] of New York City, directly to the north of [[the Bronx]] and approximately two miles (3&nbsp;km) north of the northernmost point in [[Manhattan]].\n\nYonkers' downtown is centered on a plaza known as [[Getty Square]], where the municipal government is located. The downtown area also houses significant local businesses and non-profits, and serves as a major retail hub for Yonkers and the northwest Bronx.\n\nThe city is home to several attractions, including [[Untermyer Park]]; [[Hudson River Museum]]; [[Saw Mill River]] [[Daylighting (streams)|daylighting]], wherein a parking lot was removed to uncover a river; [[Science Barge]]; [[Sherwood House (Yonkers, New York)|Sherwood House]]; and [[Yonkers Raceway]], a [[harness racing]] track that has renovated its grounds and clubhouse and added legalized [[video slot machine]] [[gambling]] in 2006 in a \"[[racino]]\" called Empire City.\n\nMajor shopping areas are located in [[Getty Square]], on South Broadway, at the [[Cross County Shopping Center]] and [[Westchester's Ridge Hill]], and along [[New York State Route 100|Central Park Avenue]], informally called \"Central Ave\" by area residents, a name it takes officially a few miles north in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]].\n\nYonkers is known as the \"[[City of Seven Hills]]\" which includes Park Hill, Nodine Hill, Ridge Hill, Cross Hill, Locust Hill, Glen Hill, and Church Hill.\n\nAnd oh boy do we have ravioli!\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Philipse Manor Hall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor Hall]]]]\nThe land on which the city is built was once part of a {{convert|24,000|acre|km2|abbr=off|adj=on|sp=us}} land grant called [[Colen Donck]] that ran from the current Manhattan-Bronx border at [[Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York|Marble Hill]] northwards for {{convert|12|mi|0}}, and from the [[Hudson River]] eastwards to the [[Bronx River]]. In July 1645, this area was granted to [[Adriaen van der Donck]], the [[patroon]] of Colendonck.  Van der Donck was known locally as the ''[[Jonkheer]]'' or ''Jonker'' (etymologically, \"young gentleman,\" derivation of old Dutch ''jong'' (''young'') and ''heer'' (\"lord\"); in effect, \"[[Esquire]]\"), a word from which the name \"Yonkers\" is directly derived.<ref>{{cite web |author=Erik |url=http://www.thirteen.org/dutchny/interactives/dutch-place-names-in-new-york-city/6/ |title=Interactive Map: Dutch Place Names in New York &#124; Dutch New York |website=Thirteen.org |date=August 19, 2009 |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}</ref> Van der Donck built a [[Sawmill|saw mill]] near where the Nepperhan Creek met the Hudson; the Nepperhan is now also known as the [[Saw Mill River]].  Van der Donck was killed in the [[Peach War]]. His wife, Mary Doughty, was taken captive and ransomed later.\n\nNear the site of van der Donck's mill is [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor Hall]], a Colonial-era manor house which today serves as a museum and archive, offering many glimpses into life before the American Revolution. The original structure (later enlarged) was built around 1682 by [[Frederick Philipse]] and his wife Margaret Hardenbroeck. Frederick was a wealthy Dutchman who by the time of his death had amassed an enormous estate, which encompassed the entire modern City of Yonkers, as well as several other Hudson River towns. Philipse's great-grandson, Frederick Philipse III, was a prominent [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] during the [[American Revolution]], who, because of his political leanings, was forced to flee to England. All the lands that belonged to the Philipse family were confiscated and sold.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:View of Yonkers, New York (NYPL Hades-1803881-1659418).jpg|thumb|Yonkers, New York]]\nFor its first 200 years, Yonkers was a small farming town with an active industrial waterfront. Yonkers's later growth rested largely on developing industry. In 1853, [[Elisha Otis]] invented the first safety elevator and the [[Otis Elevator Company]] opened the first elevator factory in the world on the banks of the Hudson near what is now Vark Street. It relocated to larger quarters (now the Yonkers Public Library) in the 1880s. Around the same time, the [[Alexander Smith Carpet Mills Historic District|Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Company]] (in the Saw Mill River Valley) expanded to 45 buildings, 800 looms, and more than 4,000 workers and was known as one of the premier carpet-producing centers in the world.\n\nThe community was incorporated as a village in the northern part of the town of Yonkers in 1854 and as a city in 1872. In 1874 the southern part of the town, including [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] and [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], was annexed by New York City as [[The Bronx]]. In 1898, Yonkers (along with [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]]) voted on a referendum to determine if they wanted to become part of New York City. While the results were positive elsewhere, the returns were so negative in Yonkers and neighboring [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]] that those two areas were not included in the consolidated city and remained independent.<ref>{{cite inside}}, p.177-78</ref> Still, some residents call the city \"the [[Sixth Borough]]\" referring to its location on the New York City border, its urban character, and the failed merger vote.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], 254 Yonkers resident joined the Army and Navy. They enlisted primarily in four different regiments. These included the [[6th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment|6th New York Heavy Artillery]], the [[5th New York Volunteer Infantry]], the [[17th New York Volunteer Infantry|17th New York Volunteers]], and the 15th NY National Guard. During the [[New York City draft riots|New York City Draft Riots]], Yonkers formed the Home Guards. This force of constables was formed to protect Yonkers for rioting that was feared to spread from New York City, which fortunately for Yonkers residents it never did. In total, seventeen Yonkers residents were killed during the Civil War.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Yonkers in the Rebellion 1861-1965 |last=Atkins |first=Thomas Astley |publisher=The Yonkers Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument Association |year=1892 |isbn= |location= |pages=21\u201373}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New York and Putnam Railroad|New York City and Northern Railway Company]] (later the [[New York Central Railroad]]) connected Yonkers to Manhattan and points north from 1888. A three-mile spur to [[Getty Square]] existed until 1943.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kinglyheirs.com/AbandonedRR/Putnam1.html |title=New York Central\\'s Putnam Division |first=Ken |last=Kinlock |work=kinglyheirs.com}}</ref>\n\nAside from being a manufacturing center, Yonkers played a key role in the development of entertainment in the United States. In 1888, Scottish-born John Reid founded the first [[golf course]] in the United States, St. Andrew's Golf Club, in Yonkers.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-29310735 \"Ryder Cup: Painting celebrates Dunfermline links to American golf\"].

Today, two of the former [[Alexander Smith Carpet Mills Historic District|Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Company]] loft buildings located at 540 and 578 Nepperhan Avenue have been repurposed to house the [[YoHo Artist Community]], a collective group of talented artists that works out of private studios there.<ref>Fallon, Bill (March 3, 2008). \"Industrial Arts: Carpet Mills Become Studio Central,\" ''Westchester County Business Journal'', p. 49.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], a total of 6,909 Yonkers residents entered military service.

In 1916, there were one hundred twenty-six people in the Yonkers chapter of the Red Cross. By the end of the war, 15,358 Yonkers residents were members of the chapter. Some of the activities that the Yonkers Chapter of the Red Cross participated in were preparing surgical dressings, creating hospital garments for the wounded, and knitting articles of clothing for refugees and soldiers. Besides joining the Red Cross, residents of Yonkers donated to various war drives. The total amount raised for these drives were $19,255,255.<ref name=\"Yonkers in the World War\"/>{{rp|23&ndash;24}}\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Yonkers also hosted a [[brass era]] [[automobile]] maker, [[Colt Runabout Company]];<ref>No apparent relation to Colt's Patent Firearms. Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.63.</ref> despite the car's seemingly glowing performance, the company went under. Yonkers was also the headquarters of the Waring Hat Company, at the time the nation's largest hat manufacturer. [[World War II]] saw the city's factories manufacture such items as tents and blankets in the Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Factory and tanks in the Otis Elevator factory. After World War II, however, with increased competition from less expensive imports, Yonkers lost much of its manufacturing activity. The Alexander Smith Carpet Company, one of the city's largest employers, ceased operation during a labor dispute in June 1954.\n\nIn 1983, the Otis Elevator Factory finally closed its doors. With the loss of jobs in the city itself, Yonkers became primarily a residential city, and some neighborhoods, such as [[Crestwood, Yonkers, New York|Crestwood]] and [[Park Hill, Yonkers|Park Hill]], became popular with wealthy New Yorkers who wished to live outside Manhattan without giving up urban conveniences. Yonkers's excellent transportation infrastructure, including three commuter railroad lines (now two: the [[Harlem Line|Harlem]] and [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]]s) and five parkways and thruways, as well as its 15-minute drive from Manhattan and picturesque prewar homes and apartment buildings, made it a desirable city in which to live. Yonkers's manufacturing sector has also shown a recent resurgence.\n\nOn January 4, 1940, Yonkers resident [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] transmitted the first [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio broadcast (on station [[W2XCR]]) from the Yonkers home of C.R. Runyon, a co-experimenter. Yonkers also had the longest running [[pirate radio]] station, owned by Allan Weiner during the 1970s through the 1980s.\n\nIn 1942, a short subway connection was planned between Getty Square and the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]], which terminates in Riverdale at [[242nd Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|242nd Street]] just slightly south of the city line, but the plan was dropped.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wants Subway Extended: Yonkers Mayor to Ask City to Take Over N.Y.C.

After a 1985 decision and an unsuccessful appeal, Yonkers's schools were integrated in 1988. Federal judge [[Leonard B. Sand]] ruled that Yonkers had engaged in institutional segregation in housing and school policies for over 40 years and tied the illegal concentration of public housing and private housing discrimination to the city's resistance to ending racial isolation in its public schools.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n[[File:Yonkers Public Library 02.JPG|thumb|left|[[Yonkers Public Library]]]]\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Yonkers developed a national reputation for racial tension, based on a long-term battle between the city and the [[NAACP]] over the building of subsidized low-income housing projects. The city planned to use federal funding for [[urban renewal]] efforts within Downtown Yonkers exclusively; other groups, led by the NAACP, felt that the resulting concentration of low-income housing in traditionally poor neighborhoods perpetuated poverty. Although the City of Yonkers had been warned in 1971 by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development against further building of low-income housing in west Yonkers, subsidized housing continued to be built in this area between 1972 and 1977.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Study of African-American Life in Yonkers From the Turn of the Century |last=Esannson |first=Harold |last2=Bagwell |first2=Vinnie |publisher=Harold Esannson |year=1993 |isbn= |location= |pages=50}}</ref> Yonkers gained national/international attention during the summer of 1988, when it reneged on its previous agreement to build promised municipal public housing in the eastern portions of the city, an agreement it had made in a consent decree after losing an appeal in 1987. After its reversal, the city was found in contempt of the federal courts, and Judge Sand imposed a fine on Yonkers which started at $100 and doubled every day, capped at $1 million per day by an appeals court,<ref>{{cite news|title=Leonard B.

First-term mayor [[Nick Wasicsko|Nicholas C. Wasicsko]] fought to save the city from financial disaster and bring about unity. Yonkers's youngest mayor (elected at age 28), Wasicsko was a lonely figure in city politics, which was scarred with the stigma of the \"[[Balkanization]] of Yonkers\". He succeeded in helping to end the city's contempt of the courts, but was voted out of office as a result. His story is the subject of a miniseries called ''[[Show Me a Hero]]'' that aired on [[HBO]] in 2015, which is based on the 1999 nonfiction book of the same name by former ''[[New York Times]]'' writer, Lisa Belkin.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nA [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki]] railroad cars assembly plant opened in 1986 in the former Otis plant, producing the new [[R142A (New York City Subway car)|R142A]], [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]], [[R160B (New York City Subway car)|R160B]], and [[R188 (New York City Subway car)|R188]] cars for the [[New York City Subway]], and the PA4 and PA5 series for [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]].\n\n===Ethnic communities===\nToday, Yonkers is a diverse community, with residents of many ethnicities.  Hispanics are prominent in Yonkers including large populations of Dominicans and Puerto Ricans.  Also prominent is the African American community, many of whom migrated north to Yonkers during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the 1930s to the 1970s.\n\n[[File:Dignitaries at the Yonkers Saint Patrick's Parade.JPG|thumb|right|Dignitaries at the 2005 Yonkers Saint Patrick's Day Parade]]\n\nThe Irish-American community is prominent in Yonkers, and the city hosts one of the nation's oldest [[St. Patrick's Day]] parades. It is also home to a large [[Italian-American]] community, and the city hosts a large [[Columbus Day]] festival with a \"Miss Italian-American\" pageant. Yonkers also has a significant [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] population.\n\nYonkers also has a large [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] community. In the early and mid-20th century a large number of people emigrated from [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Russia]], and [[Croatia]]. Recently a large number of immigrants from the former [[Yugoslavia]] have called Yonkers home. The Slavic community is centered around St. Casimir's Roman Catholic Church, Most Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church, Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church, and St. Michael's Ukrainian Catholic Church. The city also has a ''stanytsia'' (branch) of [[Plast]].\n\nYonkers also has a large [[Arab American|Arab]] population, coinciding with the high percentage of Arabic speakers in Yonkers. Most of these Arabs come from [[the Levant]] region, mainly from [[Jordan]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Lebanon]], and are of the Christian faith. The Arabic community specifically Jordanian currently has three churches in the city, Virgin Mary Orthodox Church, [[Immaculate Conception St. Mary's Church|St Mary's Roman Catholic Church]], and Christ the Savior Melkite Church. The community settled in Yonkers in the late 1940s and has since continued a steady growth.\n\nThere also once was a significant [[Jewish]] population (the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]'' and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello Dolly]]'' take place within the Yonkers Jewish community). However, it has since dwindled.\n\n===21st century===\nIn the 2000s, some areas bordering similar neighborhoods in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], [[The Bronx|Bronx]] began seeing an influx of [[Orthodox Jew]]s. Subsequently, Riverdale [[Hatzalah]] Volunteer Ambulance Service began serving some neighborhoods in the southwest section of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riverdalehatzalah.org/ |title=Riverdale Hatzalah |work=riverdalehatzalah.org}}</ref>  There is also a small Jewish cemetery, the Sherwood Park Cemetery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://test.histopolis.com/Place/US/NY/Westchester_County/Sherwood_Park_Cemetery |title=Sherwood Park Cemetery, Yonkers, Westchester County, New York, United States - Nearby Cities, Nearby Cemeteries and Genealogy Resources - Histopolis |website=Test.histopolis.com |date=November 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125075738/http://test.histopolis.com/Place/US/NY/Westchester_County/Sherwood_Park_Cemetery |archive-date=January 25, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Yonkers NY Waterfront.JPG|thumb|High-rise apartments along the Hudson River in Northwest Yonkers]]\nThe city is spread out over hills rising from near sea level at the eastern bank of the [[Hudson River]] to 416 feet (126 m) at Sacred Heart Church, whose spire can be seen from [[Long Island]], [[New York City]], and [[New Jersey]].\n\nThe city occupies 20.3&nbsp;square miles (52.6&nbsp;km\u00b2), including 18.1 square miles (46.8&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land and 2.2 square miles (5.8&nbsp;km\u00b2) (11.02%) of water, according to the [[United States Census Bureau]].\nThe [[Bronx River]] separates Yonkers from [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]], [[Tuckahoe (village), New York|Tuckahoe]], [[Eastchester, New York|Eastchester]], [[Bronxville]], and [[Scarsdale]] to the east.

There are 37 or more distinct neighborhoods, though many of these names are rarely used today except by older residents and real-estate brokers.\n\n===Northeast Yonkers===\n\nNortheast Yonkers is a primarily [[Irish-American]] and [[Italian-American]] area. House sizes vary widely, from small houses set close together, to larger homes in areas like Lawrence Park West and mid-rise apartment buildings along Central Avenue ([[NY 100]]). Central Avenue (officially named Central Park Avenue) provides an abundance of shopping for Yonkers residents. Shopping \ncenters along Central Avenue include stores such as Best Buy, Burlington Coat Factory, Kohl's, Bob's Furniture and Barnes & Noble, as well as many other stores and restaurants. Notable former residents include [[Steven Tyler]] (born Steven Tallarico) of the rock band [[Aerosmith]], whose childhood home was just off Central Avenue on Pembrook Drive.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nNortheast Yonkers contains the upscale neighborhoods of [[Crestwood, Yonkers, New York|Crestwood]], Colonial Heights, and Cedar Knolls, as well as the wealthy enclaves of Beech Hill and Lawrence Park West. It also contains a gated community off the eastern edge of the Grassy Sprain Reservoir known as [[Winchester Villages]]. Landmarks include [[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary|St Vladimir's Seminary]], as well as [[Sarah Lawrence College]], and the Tanglewood Shopping Center (one-time home of [[The Tanglewood Boys]] gang). Northeast Yonkers is somewhat more expensive than the rest of the city, and due to the proximity of several [[Metro-North]] commuter railroad stations, its residents tend to be employed in corporate positions in [[Manhattan]].\n\n[[File:Blue Cube 1 Point Street Yonkers jeh.jpg|thumb|The Blue Cube, a landmark former factory on the Northwest Yonkers waterfront.]][[File:Yonkholy3jeh.JPG|thumb|Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church]]\n[[File:Yonkers 800.jpg|thumb|Riverdale Avenue looking north from the [[Bronx]] line]]\n[[File:Messiah Baptist 76 Wharburton jeh.jpg|thumb|Messiah Baptist Church]]\n\n===Northwest Yonkers===\nNorthwest Yonkers is a collection of widely varying neighborhoods, spanning from the [[Hudson River]] to around the [[New York State Thruway]]/I-87 and from Ashburton Avenue north to the [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]] border. With the Hudson River bordering it to the west, this area has many [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-era homes]] with panoramic views of [[New Jersey Palisades|the Palisades]]. An interest in historic preservation has taken hold in this neighborhood in recent years,{{when|date=March 2019}} as demonstrated on streets like Shonnard Terrace, Delavan Terrace, and Hudson Terrace.\n\nNeighborhoods include Nepera Park, [[Runyon Heights, Yonkers|Runyon Heights]], Homefield, Glenwood, and Greystone. Landmarks include the [[Hudson River Museum]], the Lenoir Nature Preserve, and the nationally recognized Untermyer Park and Gardens. The significant amount of surviving Victorian architecture and 19th-century estates in northwest Yonkers has attracted many filmmakers in recent years. In fact, the Untermyer Park and Gardens is not only Yonkers hidden gem but is the number one attraction in Westchester County.\n\nThe two block section of Palisade Avenue between Chase and Roberts Avenues in northwest Yonkers is colloquially known as \"the north end\" or \"the end\". It was and still is the only retail area in the neighborhood, and was well known for an original soda fountain store, \"Urich's,\" and Robbins Pharmacy. It was once the end of the #2 trolley line, which has since been replaced by a [[Bee-Line Bus System|Bee-line Bus]] route. One part of Yonkers that is sometimes overlooked is Nepera Park. This is a small section at the northern part of Nepperhan Avenue on the Hastings-on-Hudson border. Nepperhan Avenue in Nepera Park is also a major shopping district for the area.\n\n===Southeast Yonkers===\nSoutheast Yonkers is mostly Irish-American (many of the Irish being native born) and Italian-American. Many of the businesses and type of architecture in southeast Yonkers bear a greater resemblance to certain parts of [[the Bronx]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], or [[Staten Island]] than to points north. Southeastern Yonkers is largely within walking distance of the [[Woodlawn, Bronx|Woodlawn]] and [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] sections of the Bronx. Many residents regard eastern McLean Avenue, home to a vibrant Irish community shared with Woodlawn, to be the true hub of Yonkers.\n\nSimilarly, a portion of Midland Avenue in the [[Dunwoodie, Yonkers, New York|Dunwoodie]] section has been called the \"Little Italy\" of Yonkers. Landmarks of southeastern Yonkers include the [[Cross County Shopping Center]], Yonkers Raceway, and [[St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie|St. Joseph's Seminary]] in the Dunwoodie neighborhood, which was visited by [[Pope John Paul II]] in October 1995 and later by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in April 2008.\n\n===Southwest Yonkers===\n[[Getty Square]] is Yonkers' [[downtown]] and the [[civic center]] and [[central business district]] of the city. Much of southwest Yonkers grew densely along the multiple railroads and trolley (now bus) lines along South Broadway and in [[Getty Square]], connecting to [[New York City]]. Clusters of apartment buildings surrounded the stations of the Yonkers branch of the [[New York and Putnam Railroad]] and the [[Third Avenue Railway]] trolley lines and these buildings still remain although now served by the [[Bee-Line Bus System]]. The railroad companies themselves built neighborhoods of mixed housing types ranging from apartment buildings to large mansions in areas like [[Park Hill, Yonkers|Park Hill]] wherein the railroad also built a [[funicular]] to connect it with the train station in the valley. This traditionally African-American and white area has seen a tremendous influx of immigrants from Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, South Asia, and the Middle East. Off South Broadway and Yonkers Avenue one can find residential neighborhoods, such as Lowerre, Nodine Hill, [[Park Hill, Yonkers|Park Hill]], and Hudson Park (off the Hudson River) with a mix of building styles ranging from dense clusters of apartment buildings, blocks of retail with apartments above, multifamily [[row house]]s, and detached single-family homes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victoriansource.com/id4.html |title=Yonkers Victorian Homes |work=victoriansource.com}}</ref>\n\nOther neighborhoods of these types, although with a larger number of detached houses, are Ludlow Park, Hudson Park, and Van Cortlandt Crest, off Riverdale Avenue next to the border with [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]].\n\nThe area is also home to significant historical and educational institutions including the historic [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor Hall]] (a New York State Historic Site that houses one of three papier-mache ceilings in the United States), The [[Science Barge]], Beczak Environmental Education Center, and a 2003 [[Yonkers Public Library]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ypl.org/hoursanddirec.htm#RIV |title=Welcome to the Yonkers Public Library!-Hours and Directions |website=Ypl.org |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729014156/http://www.ypl.org/hoursanddirec.htm#RIV |archivedate=July 29, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMany residents are of [[African American|African]], [[Caribbean]], [[Italian people|Italian]], or [[Mexican people|Mexican]] descent while an influx those from other cultural backgrounds has continued to shape a culturally diverse community. Some neighborhoods right on the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] border are increasingly becoming home to [[Orthodox Jew]]s. The revitalization of the [[Getty Square]] area has helped to nurture growth for Southwest Yonkers.\n\nIn the early 2000s several new luxury apartment buildings were built along the Hudson. There is also a new \"Sculpture Meadow on the Hudson,\" renovation of a Victorian-era pier, and a new public library housed in the remodeled Otis elevator factory. [[Peter X. Kelly|Peter Kelly]]'s award-winning fine dining restaurant X<sub>2</sub>0 - Xaviars on Hudson is located at the renovated pier with much success.<ref>Johnson, Liz (February 3, 2010).

The [[Yonkers City Council]] consists of seven members, six each elected from one of six districts, as well as a Council President to preside over the council. The mayor and city council president are elected in a citywide vote. The current mayor is Democrat [[Mike Spano]] and the Council President is Michael Khader.\n\nYonkers is typically a Democratic stronghold just like the rest of Westchester County and most of [[New York (state)|New York]] state on the national level. In 1992, Yonkers voted for [[George H. W. Bush]] over [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ross Perot]] for president, but has voted solidly Democratic ever since.  At a local level, recent mayors of Yonkers have included Republicans [[Phil Amicone]] and [[John Spencer (mayor)|John Spencer]], while the [[Yonkers City Council]] has mostly been controlled by Republicans.  In the State Assembly, Yonkers is represented by Democrats [[J. Gary Pretlow]] and Nader Sayegh, and in the [[New York State Senate]], by Democrats [[Andrea Stewart-Cousins]] and [[Shelley Mayer]]. At the federal level, Democratic representative [[Eliot Engel]] represents the city.\n\n==Education==\nPublic schools in Yonkers are operated by [[Yonkers Public Schools]].\n\n[[Sarah Lawrence College]], which gives its address as Bronxville, NY 10708,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slc.edu/ |title=Sarah Lawrence College.

It is the fourth most populous city in the U.S. state of New York, behind [[New York City]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]. The population of Yonkers was 195,976 as enumerated in the [[2010 United States Census]] and is estimated to have increased by 2.5% to 199,663 in 2018.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> It is an [[inner suburb]] of New York City, directly to the north of [[the Bronx]] and approximately two miles (3&nbsp;km) north of the northernmost point in [[Manhattan]].\n\nYonkers' downtown is centered on a plaza known as [[Getty Square]], where the municipal government is located. The downtown area also houses significant local businesses and non-profits, and serves as a major retail hub for Yonkers and the northwest Bronx.\n\nThe city is home to several attractions, including [[Untermyer Park]]; [[Hudson River Museum]]; [[Saw Mill River]] [[Daylighting (streams)|daylighting]], wherein a parking lot was removed to uncover a river; [[Science Barge]]; [[Sherwood House (Yonkers, New York)|Sherwood House]]; and [[Yonkers Raceway]], a [[harness racing]] track that has renovated its grounds and clubhouse and added legalized [[video slot machine]] [[gambling]] in 2006 in a \"[[racino]]\" called Empire City.\n\nMajor shopping areas are located in [[Getty Square]], on South Broadway, at the [[Cross County Shopping Center]] and [[Westchester's Ridge Hill]], and along [[New York State Route 100|Central Park Avenue]], informally called \"Central Ave\" by area residents, a name it takes officially a few miles north in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]].\n\nYonkers is known as the \"[[City of Seven Hills]]\" which includes Park Hill, Nodine Hill, Ridge Hill, Cross Hill, Locust Hill, Glen Hill, and Church Hill.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Philipse Manor Hall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor Hall]]]]\nThe land on which the city is built was once part of a {{convert|24,000|acre|km2|abbr=off|adj=on|sp=us}} land grant called [[Colen Donck]] that ran from the current Manhattan-Bronx border at [[Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York|Marble Hill]] northwards for {{convert|12|mi|0}}, and from the [[Hudson River]] eastwards to the [[Bronx River]]. In July 1645, this area was granted to [[Adriaen van der Donck]], the [[patroon]] of Colendonck.  Van der Donck was known locally as the ''[[Jonkheer]]'' or ''Jonker'' (etymologically, \"young gentleman,\" derivation of old Dutch ''jong'' (''young'') and ''heer'' (\"lord\"); in effect, \"[[Esquire]]\"), a word from which the name \"Yonkers\" is directly derived.<ref>{{cite web |author=Erik |url=http://www.thirteen.org/dutchny/interactives/dutch-place-names-in-new-york-city/6/ |title=Interactive Map: Dutch Place Names in New York &#124; Dutch New York |website=Thirteen.org |date=August 19, 2009 |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}</ref> Van der Donck built a [[Sawmill|saw mill]] near where the Nepperhan Creek met the Hudson; the Nepperhan is now also known as the [[Saw Mill River]].  Van der Donck was killed in the [[Peach War]]. His wife, Mary Doughty, was taken captive and ransomed later.\n\nNear the site of van der Donck's mill is [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor Hall]], a Colonial-era manor house which today serves as a museum and archive, offering many glimpses into life before the American Revolution. The original structure (later enlarged) was built around 1682 by [[Frederick Philipse]] and his wife Margaret Hardenbroeck. Frederick was a wealthy Dutchman who by the time of his death had amassed an enormous estate, which encompassed the entire modern City of Yonkers, as well as several other Hudson River towns. Philipse's great-grandson, Frederick Philipse III, was a prominent [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] during the [[American Revolution]], who, because of his political leanings, was forced to flee to England. All the lands that belonged to the Philipse family were confiscated and sold.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:View of Yonkers, New York (NYPL Hades-1803881-1659418).jpg|thumb|Yonkers, New York]]\nFor its first 200 years, Yonkers was a small farming town with an active industrial waterfront. Yonkers's later growth rested largely on developing industry. In 1853, [[Elisha Otis]] invented the first safety elevator and the [[Otis Elevator Company]] opened the first elevator factory in the world on the banks of the Hudson near what is now Vark Street. It relocated to larger quarters (now the Yonkers Public Library) in the 1880s. Around the same time, the [[Alexander Smith Carpet Mills Historic District|Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Company]] (in the Saw Mill River Valley) expanded to 45 buildings, 800 looms, and more than 4,000 workers and was known as one of the premier carpet-producing centers in the world.\n\nThe community was incorporated as a village in the northern part of the town of Yonkers in 1854 and as a city in 1872. In 1874 the southern part of the town, including [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] and [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], was annexed by New York City as [[The Bronx]]. In 1898, Yonkers (along with [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]]) voted on a referendum to determine if they wanted to become part of New York City. While the results were positive elsewhere, the returns were so negative in Yonkers and neighboring [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]] that those two areas were not included in the consolidated city and remained independent.<ref>{{cite inside}}, p.177-78</ref> Still, some residents call the city \"the [[Sixth Borough]]\" referring to its location on the New York City border, its urban character, and the failed merger vote.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], 254 Yonkers resident joined the Army and Navy. They enlisted primarily in four different regiments. These included the [[6th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment|6th New York Heavy Artillery]], the [[5th New York Volunteer Infantry]], the [[17th New York Volunteer Infantry|17th New York Volunteers]], and the 15th NY National Guard. During the [[New York City draft riots|New York City Draft Riots]], Yonkers formed the Home Guards. This force of constables was formed to protect Yonkers for rioting that was feared to spread from New York City, which fortunately for Yonkers residents it never did. In total, seventeen Yonkers residents were killed during the Civil War.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Yonkers in the Rebellion 1861-1965 |last=Atkins |first=Thomas Astley |publisher=The Yonkers Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument Association |year=1892 |isbn= |location= |pages=21\u201373}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New York and Putnam Railroad|New York City and Northern Railway Company]] (later the [[New York Central Railroad]]) connected Yonkers to Manhattan and points north from 1888. A three-mile spur to [[Getty Square]] existed until 1943.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kinglyheirs.com/AbandonedRR/Putnam1.html |title=New York Central\\'s Putnam Division |first=Ken |last=Kinlock |work=kinglyheirs.com}}</ref>\n\nAside from being a manufacturing center, Yonkers played a key role in the development of entertainment in the United States. In 1888, Scottish-born John Reid founded the first [[golf course]] in the United States, St. Andrew's Golf Club, in Yonkers.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-29310735 \"Ryder Cup: Painting celebrates Dunfermline links to American golf\"].

Today, two of the former [[Alexander Smith Carpet Mills Historic District|Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Company]] loft buildings located at 540 and 578 Nepperhan Avenue have been repurposed to house the [[YoHo Artist Community]], a collective group of talented artists that works out of private studios there.<ref>Fallon, Bill (March 3, 2008). \"Industrial Arts: Carpet Mills Become Studio Central,\" ''Westchester County Business Journal'', p. 49.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], a total of 6,909 Yonkers residents entered military service. This was approximately seven percent of the population.<ref name=\"Yonkers in the World War\">{{Cite book |title=Yonkers in the World War |last= |first= |publisher=The Plimpton Press |year=1922 |isbn= |location=Norwood, Mass.}}</ref>{{rp|vi}} Most Yonkers men joined either the [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th Division]] or the [[77th Division (United States)|77th Division]].<ref name=\"Yonkers in the World War\"/>{{rp|6}} In total one hundred thirty-seven Yonkers residents were killed during the war.<ref name=\"Yonkers in the World War\"/>{{rp|77}} Among the survivors of the ''[[USS President Lincoln (1907)|U.S.S.

In 1916, there were one hundred twenty-six people in the Yonkers chapter of the Red Cross. By the end of the war, 15,358 Yonkers residents were members of the chapter. Some of the activities that the Yonkers Chapter of the Red Cross participated in were preparing surgical dressings, creating hospital garments for the wounded, and knitting articles of clothing for refugees and soldiers. Besides joining the Red Cross, residents of Yonkers donated to various war drives. The total amount raised for these drives were $19,255,255.<ref name=\"Yonkers in the World War\"/>{{rp|23&ndash;24}}\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Yonkers also hosted a [[brass era]] [[automobile]] maker, [[Colt Runabout Company]];<ref>No apparent relation to Colt's Patent Firearms. Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.63.</ref> despite the car's seemingly glowing performance, the company went under. Yonkers was also the headquarters of the Waring Hat Company, at the time the nation's largest hat manufacturer. [[World War II]] saw the city's factories manufacture such items as tents and blankets in the Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Factory and tanks in the Otis Elevator factory. After World War II, however, with increased competition from less expensive imports, Yonkers lost much of its manufacturing activity. The Alexander Smith Carpet Company, one of the city's largest employers, ceased operation during a labor dispute in June 1954.\n\nIn 1983, the Otis Elevator Factory finally closed its doors. With the loss of jobs in the city itself, Yonkers became primarily a residential city, and some neighborhoods, such as [[Crestwood, Yonkers, New York|Crestwood]] and [[Park Hill, Yonkers|Park Hill]], became popular with wealthy New Yorkers who wished to live outside Manhattan without giving up urban conveniences. Yonkers's excellent transportation infrastructure, including three commuter railroad lines (now two: the [[Harlem Line|Harlem]] and [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]]s) and five parkways and thruways, as well as its 15-minute drive from Manhattan and picturesque prewar homes and apartment buildings, made it a desirable city in which to live. Yonkers's manufacturing sector has also shown a recent resurgence.\n\nOn January 4, 1940, Yonkers resident [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] transmitted the first [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio broadcast (on station [[W2XCR]]) from the Yonkers home of C.R. Runyon, a co-experimenter. Yonkers also had the longest running [[pirate radio]] station, owned by Allan Weiner during the 1970s through the 1980s.\n\nIn 1942, a short subway connection was planned between Getty Square and the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]], which terminates in Riverdale at [[242nd Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|242nd Street]] just slightly south of the city line, but the plan was dropped.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wants Subway Extended: Yonkers Mayor to Ask City to Take Over N.Y.C.

After a 1985 decision and an unsuccessful appeal, Yonkers's schools were integrated in 1988. Federal judge [[Leonard B. Sand]] ruled that Yonkers had engaged in institutional segregation in housing and school policies for over 40 years and tied the illegal concentration of public housing and private housing discrimination to the city's resistance to ending racial isolation in its public schools.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n[[File:Yonkers Public Library 02.JPG|thumb|left|[[Yonkers Public Library]]]]\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Yonkers developed a national reputation for racial tension, based on a long-term battle between the city and the [[NAACP]] over the building of subsidized low-income housing projects. The city planned to use federal funding for [[urban renewal]] efforts within Downtown Yonkers exclusively; other groups, led by the NAACP, felt that the resulting concentration of low-income housing in traditionally poor neighborhoods perpetuated poverty. Although the City of Yonkers had been warned in 1971 by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development against further building of low-income housing in west Yonkers, subsidized housing continued to be built in this area between 1972 and 1977.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Study of African-American Life in Yonkers From the Turn of the Century |last=Esannson |first=Harold |last2=Bagwell |first2=Vinnie |publisher=Harold Esannson |year=1993 |isbn= |location= |pages=50}}</ref> Yonkers gained national/international attention during the summer of 1988, when it reneged on its previous agreement to build promised municipal public housing in the eastern portions of the city, an agreement it had made in a consent decree after losing an appeal in 1987. After its reversal, the city was found in contempt of the federal courts, and Judge Sand imposed a fine on Yonkers which started at $100 and doubled every day, capped at $1 million per day by an appeals court,<ref>{{cite news|title=Leonard B. Sand, Judge in Landmark Yonkers Segregation Case, Dies at 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/nyregion/judge-leonard-sand-dead-yonkers-housing.html|accessdate=May 10, 2018|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 5, 2016}}</ref> until the city capitulated to the federally mandated plan.\n\nYonkers remained in contempt of court until September 9, 1988, when the City Council relented in the wake of library closures and sanitation cutbacks and while looking at massive city layoffs which would have been required to continue its resistance to desegregation. First-term mayor [[Nick Wasicsko|Nicholas C. Wasicsko]] fought to save the city from financial disaster and bring about unity. Yonkers's youngest mayor (elected at age 28), Wasicsko was a lonely figure in city politics, which was scarred with the stigma of the \"[[Balkanization]] of Yonkers\". He succeeded in helping to end the city's contempt of the courts, but was voted out of office as a result. His story is the subject of a miniseries called ''[[Show Me a Hero]]'' that aired on [[HBO]] in 2015, which is based on the 1999 nonfiction book of the same name by former ''[[New York Times]]'' writer, Lisa Belkin.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nA [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki]] railroad cars assembly plant opened in 1986 in the former Otis plant, producing the new [[R142A (New York City Subway car)|R142A]], [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]], [[R160B (New York City Subway car)|R160B]], and [[R188 (New York City Subway car)|R188]] cars for the [[New York City Subway]], and the PA4 and PA5 series for [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]].\n\n===Ethnic communities===\nToday, Yonkers is a diverse community, with residents of many ethnicities.  Hispanics are prominent in Yonkers including large populations of Dominicans and Puerto Ricans.  Also prominent is the African American community, many of whom migrated north to Yonkers during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the 1930s to the 1970s.\n\n[[File:Dignitaries at the Yonkers Saint Patrick's Parade.JPG|thumb|right|Dignitaries at the 2005 Yonkers Saint Patrick's Day Parade]]\n\nThe Irish-American community is prominent in Yonkers, and the city hosts one of the nation's oldest [[St. Patrick's Day]] parades. It is also home to a large [[Italian-American]] community, and the city hosts a large [[Columbus Day]] festival with a \"Miss Italian-American\" pageant. Yonkers also has a significant [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] population.\n\nYonkers also has a large [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] community. In the early and mid-20th century a large number of people emigrated from [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Russia]], and [[Croatia]]. Recently a large number of immigrants from the former [[Yugoslavia]] have called Yonkers home. The Slavic community is centered around St. Casimir's Roman Catholic Church, Most Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church, Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church, and St. Michael's Ukrainian Catholic Church. The city also has a ''stanytsia'' (branch) of [[Plast]].\n\nYonkers also has a large [[Arab American|Arab]] population, coinciding with the high percentage of Arabic speakers in Yonkers. Most of these Arabs come from [[the Levant]] region, mainly from [[Jordan]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Lebanon]], and are of the Christian faith. The Arabic community specifically Jordanian currently has three churches in the city, Virgin Mary Orthodox Church, [[Immaculate Conception St. Mary's Church|St Mary's Roman Catholic Church]], and Christ the Savior Melkite Church. The community settled in Yonkers in the late 1940s and has since continued a steady growth.\n\nThere also once was a significant [[Jewish]] population (the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]'' and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello Dolly]]'' take place within the Yonkers Jewish community). However, it has since dwindled.\n\n===21st century===\nIn the 2000s, some areas bordering similar neighborhoods in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], [[The Bronx|Bronx]] began seeing an influx of [[Orthodox Jew]]s.

The town of [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]] is to the north, and on the western border is the [[Hudson River]].\n\nOn the south, Yonkers borders the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], [[Woodlawn, Bronx|Woodlawn]], and [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] sections of [[The Bronx]]. In addition, the southernmost point of Yonkers is only {{convert|2|mi|0|abbr=off}} north of the northernmost point of [[Manhattan]] when measured from Broadway & Caryl Avenue in Yonkers to Broadway & West 228th Street in the [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] section of Manhattan.\n\nMuch of the city grew up around the [[Saw Mill River]], which enters Yonkers from the north and feeds into the [[Hudson River]] in the [[Getty Square]] neighborhood.  Portions of the [[Saw Mill River]] that were buried in flumes beneath parking lots are being uncovered, or [[Daylighting (streams)|\"daylighted\"]].\n\nThe [[gentilic]] for residents is alternately Yonkersonian or Yonkersite.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wordsmith.org/chat/dickson.html |title=Wordsmith.org -- Online Chat with Paul Dickson |work=wordsmith.org}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 8218\n|1870= 12733\n|1880= 18892\n|1890= 32033\n|1900= 47931\n|1910= 79803\n|1920= 100176\n|1930= 134646\n|1940= 142598\n|1950= 152798\n|1960= 190634\n|1970= 204297\n|1980= 195351\n|1990= 188082\n|2000= 196086\n|2010= 195976\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=199663\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=Historical sources: 1790-1990<ref>Forstall, Richard L.

There are 37 or more distinct neighborhoods, though many of these names are rarely used today except by older residents and real-estate brokers.\n\n===Northeast Yonkers===\n\nNortheast Yonkers is a primarily [[Irish-American]] and [[Italian-American]] area. House sizes vary widely, from small houses set close together, to larger homes in areas like Lawrence Park West and mid-rise apartment buildings along Central Avenue ([[NY 100]]). Central Avenue (officially named Central Park Avenue) provides an abundance of shopping for Yonkers residents. Shopping \ncenters along Central Avenue include stores such as Best Buy, Burlington Coat Factory, Kohl's, Bob's Furniture and Barnes & Noble, as well as many other stores and restaurants. Notable former residents include [[Steven Tyler]] (born Steven Tallarico) of the rock band [[Aerosmith]], whose childhood home was just off Central Avenue on Pembrook Drive.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nNortheast Yonkers contains the upscale neighborhoods of [[Crestwood, Yonkers, New York|Crestwood]], Colonial Heights, and Cedar Knolls, as well as the wealthy enclaves of Beech Hill and Lawrence Park West. It also contains a gated community off the eastern edge of the Grassy Sprain Reservoir known as [[Winchester Villages]]. Landmarks include [[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary|St Vladimir's Seminary]], as well as [[Sarah Lawrence College]], and the Tanglewood Shopping Center (one-time home of [[The Tanglewood Boys]] gang). Northeast Yonkers is somewhat more expensive than the rest of the city, and due to the proximity of several [[Metro-North]] commuter railroad stations, its residents tend to be employed in corporate positions in [[Manhattan]].\n\n[[File:Blue Cube 1 Point Street Yonkers jeh.jpg|thumb|The Blue Cube, a landmark former factory on the Northwest Yonkers waterfront.]][[File:Yonkholy3jeh.JPG|thumb|Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church]]\n[[File:Yonkers 800.jpg|thumb|Riverdale Avenue looking north from the [[Bronx]] line]]\n[[File:Messiah Baptist 76 Wharburton jeh.jpg|thumb|Messiah Baptist Church]]\n\n===Northwest Yonkers===\nNorthwest Yonkers is a collection of widely varying neighborhoods, spanning from the [[Hudson River]] to around the [[New York State Thruway]]/I-87 and from Ashburton Avenue north to the [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]] border. With the Hudson River bordering it to the west, this area has many [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-era homes]] with panoramic views of [[New Jersey Palisades|the Palisades]]. An interest in historic preservation has taken hold in this neighborhood in recent years,{{when|date=March 2019}} as demonstrated on streets like Shonnard Terrace, Delavan Terrace, and Hudson Terrace.\n\nNeighborhoods include Nepera Park, [[Runyon Heights, Yonkers|Runyon Heights]], Homefield, Glenwood, and Greystone. Landmarks include the [[Hudson River Museum]], the Lenoir Nature Preserve, and the nationally recognized Untermyer Park and Gardens. The significant amount of surviving Victorian architecture and 19th-century estates in northwest Yonkers has attracted many filmmakers in recent years. In fact, the Untermyer Park and Gardens is not only Yonkers hidden gem but is the number one attraction in Westchester County.\n\nThe two block section of Palisade Avenue between Chase and Roberts Avenues in northwest Yonkers is colloquially known as \"the north end\" or \"the end\". It was and still is the only retail area in the neighborhood, and was well known for an original soda fountain store, \"Urich's,\" and Robbins Pharmacy. It was once the end of the #2 trolley line, which has since been replaced by a [[Bee-Line Bus System|Bee-line Bus]] route. One part of Yonkers that is sometimes overlooked is Nepera Park. This is a small section at the northern part of Nepperhan Avenue on the Hastings-on-Hudson border. Nepperhan Avenue in Nepera Park is also a major shopping district for the area.\n\n===Southeast Yonkers===\nSoutheast Yonkers is mostly Irish-American (many of the Irish being native born) and Italian-American. Many of the businesses and type of architecture in southeast Yonkers bear a greater resemblance to certain parts of [[the Bronx]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], or [[Staten Island]] than to points north. Southeastern Yonkers is largely within walking distance of the [[Woodlawn, Bronx|Woodlawn]] and [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] sections of the Bronx. Many residents regard eastern McLean Avenue, home to a vibrant Irish community shared with Woodlawn, to be the true hub of Yonkers.\n\nSimilarly, a portion of Midland Avenue in the [[Dunwoodie, Yonkers, New York|Dunwoodie]] section has been called the \"Little Italy\" of Yonkers. Landmarks of southeastern Yonkers include the [[Cross County Shopping Center]], Yonkers Raceway, and [[St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie|St. Joseph's Seminary]] in the Dunwoodie neighborhood, which was visited by [[Pope John Paul II]] in October 1995 and later by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in April 2008.\n\n===Southwest Yonkers===\n[[Getty Square]] is Yonkers' [[downtown]] and the [[civic center]] and [[central business district]] of the city. Much of southwest Yonkers grew densely along the multiple railroads and trolley (now bus) lines along South Broadway and in [[Getty Square]], connecting to [[New York City]]. Clusters of apartment buildings surrounded the stations of the Yonkers branch of the [[New York and Putnam Railroad]] and the [[Third Avenue Railway]] trolley lines and these buildings still remain although now served by the [[Bee-Line Bus System]]. The railroad companies themselves built neighborhoods of mixed housing types ranging from apartment buildings to large mansions in areas like [[Park Hill, Yonkers|Park Hill]] wherein the railroad also built a [[funicular]] to connect it with the train station in the valley. This traditionally African-American and white area has seen a tremendous influx of immigrants from Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, South Asia, and the Middle East. Off South Broadway and Yonkers Avenue one can find residential neighborhoods, such as Lowerre, Nodine Hill, [[Park Hill, Yonkers|Park Hill]], and Hudson Park (off the Hudson River) with a mix of building styles ranging from dense clusters of apartment buildings, blocks of retail with apartments above, multifamily [[row house]]s, and detached single-family homes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victoriansource.com/id4.html |title=Yonkers Victorian Homes |work=victoriansource.com}}</ref>\n\nOther neighborhoods of these types, although with a larger number of detached houses, are Ludlow Park, Hudson Park, and Van Cortlandt Crest, off Riverdale Avenue next to the border with [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]].\n\nThe area is also home to significant historical and educational institutions including the historic [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor Hall]] (a New York State Historic Site that houses one of three papier-mache ceilings in the United States), The [[Science Barge]], Beczak Environmental Education Center, and a 2003 [[Yonkers Public Library]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ypl.org/hoursanddirec.htm#RIV |title=Welcome to the Yonkers Public Library!-Hours and Directions |website=Ypl.org |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729014156/http://www.ypl.org/hoursanddirec.htm#RIV |archivedate=July 29, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMany residents are of [[African American|African]], [[Caribbean]], [[Italian people|Italian]], or [[Mexican people|Mexican]] descent while an influx those from other cultural backgrounds has continued to shape a culturally diverse community. Some neighborhoods right on the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] border are increasingly becoming home to [[Orthodox Jew]]s. The revitalization of the [[Getty Square]] area has helped to nurture growth for Southwest Yonkers.\n\nIn the early 2000s several new luxury apartment buildings were built along the Hudson. There is also a new \"Sculpture Meadow on the Hudson,\" renovation of a Victorian-era pier, and a new public library housed in the remodeled Otis elevator factory. [[Peter X. Kelly|Peter Kelly]]'s award-winning fine dining restaurant X<sub>2</sub>0 - Xaviars on Hudson is located at the renovated pier with much success.<ref>Johnson, Liz (February 3, 2010).

The [[Yonkers City Council]] consists of seven members, six each elected from one of six districts, as well as a Council President to preside over the council. The mayor and city council president are elected in a citywide vote. The current mayor is Democrat [[Mike Spano]] and the Council President is Michael Khader.\n\nYonkers is typically a Democratic stronghold just like the rest of Westchester County and most of [[New York (state)|New York]] state on the national level. In 1992, Yonkers voted for [[George H. W. Bush]] over [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ross Perot]] for president, but has voted solidly Democratic ever since.  At a local level, recent mayors of Yonkers have included Republicans [[Phil Amicone]] and [[John Spencer (mayor)|John Spencer]], while the [[Yonkers City Council]] has mostly been controlled by Republicans.  In the State Assembly, Yonkers is represented by Democrats [[J. Gary Pretlow]] and Nader Sayegh, and in the [[New York State Senate]], by Democrats [[Andrea Stewart-Cousins]] and [[Shelley Mayer]]. At the federal level, Democratic representative [[Eliot Engel]] represents the city.\n\n==Education==\nPublic schools in Yonkers are operated by [[Yonkers Public Schools]].\n\n[[Sarah Lawrence College]], which gives its address as Bronxville, NY 10708,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slc.edu/ |title=Sarah Lawrence College.

The city agreed to give the museum a piece of land on the south shore of the [[Inner Harbor]] under the condition that its organizers would clean up residual pollution from a copper paint factory and a whiskey warehouse that formerly occupied the site.

Rather than focusing shows on specific artists or styles, it sponsors themed exhibitions with titles such as ''Wind in Your Hair'' and ''High on Life''. The museum's founder, [[Rebecca Alban Hoffberger]], takes pride in the fact that AVAM is \"pretty un-museumy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimorechronicle.com/wind_in_hair.html |title=Visionary Arts Museum Shows \"Wind in My Hair\" |publisher=Baltimorechronicle.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe founder and director of the AVAM is [[Rebecca Alban Hoffberger]], who while working in the development department of Sinai Hospital's (Baltimore) People Encouraging People (a program geared toward aiding psychiatric patients in their return to the community) began to develop the idea for a visionary museum, an idea that eventually blossomed into the American Visionary Art Museum, or AVAM. Initially, Hoffberger was simply interested in the artwork created by the patients in the People Encouraging People program, and found herself \u201cimpressed with their imagination\u201d and looking to \u201ctheir strengths, not their illnesses.\u201d\n\nHoffberger found inspiration on a visit to the [[Collection de l'art brut]] in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, which was established by French artist [[Jean Dubuffet]] as a collection of \u201cl'art brut\u201d or \u201craw art because of the untamed emotions resonating in it.\u201d Hoffberger described the museum as \u201cthe best, the most imaginative, the most original museum\u201d and soon adopted the idea of \u201cl'art brut\u201d for her own visionary museum.\n\nTo gauge the community's interest in visionary art, Hoffberger and gallery owner George Ciscle held an exhibit in 1987 titled \u201cAmerican Outsider Art,\u201d at which point she formally announced her plans for the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore. With the support of her friends and family, Hoffberger petitioned the city of Baltimore and was eventually awarded two buildings near the city's Inner Harbor worth $1.1 million. Hoffberger has said that she \u201cpublicly bent over backwards to not go to traditional art funders.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Currie|first=Donya|title=Vision Quest|url=http://www.marylandlife.com/reviews/vision-quest/page-2.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129015838/http://www.marylandlife.com/reviews/vision-quest/page-2.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-29|newspaper=Maryland Life}}</ref> The State of Maryland also issued $1.3 million in bonds to finance the construction, which helped jump-start the building process. Hoffberger also relied heavily on contributions and donations, a tradition that continues to keep the museum running today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msa.md.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/014500/014534/html/14534bio.html |title=Rebecca Alban Hoffberger, MSA SC 3520-14534 |publisher=Msa.md.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15}}</ref> Hoffberger raised $7 million in six years from donors such as [[Anita Roddick]].

Visionary artists Gerald Hawkes and Vollis Simpson were the first people to step through the doors.\n\nIn collaboration with the event's founder, Hobart Brown, AVAM brought the [[Kinetic Sculpture Race]] to the East coast in 1999. In 2004 the museum opened its third building, the Jim Rouse Visionary Center, converted from a former whiskey warehouse. The Jim Rouse Visionary Center houses such items as Kinetic Sculptures from AVAM's annual race, Baltimore painted screens, Leonard Knight's \u201cLove Balloon,\u201d DeVon Smith's \u201cWorld\u2019s First Robot Family,\u201d and an interactive display of automata from London's Cabaret Mechanical Theatre. It also features two classrooms and a 3rd floor banquet room that can accommodate up to 400 people for the museum's programs & engagements, as well as private rentals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avam.org/exhibitions/jrvc.shtml|title=James Rouse Visionary Center}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, AVAM began its popular \u201cFlicks from the Hill\u201d series with generous support from the Hughes family. Each summer, the free, outdoor family film series features a selection of movies inspired by the museum's current thematic exhibition. The films are projected on a large screen mounted below artist Adam Kurtzman's \u201cGiant Golden Hand\u201d in \u201cThe Hughes Family Outdoor Theater,\u201d and the natural amphitheater of Federal Hill can seat more than 1000 visitors for this popular outdoor film series.\n\nThe museum's many other programs include a summer arts camp and after-school program, established in 2009. AVAM is also a popular venue for weddings, hosting over 70 weddings annually. Rental/admission fees accounted for 72% of earned income in 2011, nearly three times the average for an art museum.<ref>{{cite news|last=Currie|first=Donya|title=Vision Quest|url=http://www.marylandlife.com/reviews/vision-quest/page-2.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129015838/http://www.marylandlife.com/reviews/vision-quest/page-2.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-29|newspaper=Maryland Life}}</ref>  AVAM is seeking to raise a $25 million endowment before \u201cexploring the many offers to establish a West coast branch.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=AVAM: Museum History|url=http://www.avam.org/stuff-everyone-asks/museum-history.shtml}}</ref>\n\n==Mission==\n\nHoffberger has said that \u201ca good museum does more than just have objects that stand there on pedestals.

Despite this, the museum won the support of collectors, critics, and the public through its exhibitions that examine the relationship of art to the human condition rather than to the canon of [[art history]]. In her inaugural address, Hoffberger stated that \u201cthe American Visionary Art Museum opens its doors of perception not in an effort to make war on academic or institutionalized learning, but to create a place where the best of self-taught, intuitive contributions of all kinds will be duly recognized, explored, and then championed in a clear strong voice.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=AVAM: Inaugural Address|url=http://www.avam.org/stuff-everyone-asks/inaugural-address.shtml}}</ref> Since its designation\u2014by a unanimous vote of the U.S. Congress\u2014as America's \"official national education center, repository and museum for self-taught, intuitive artistry,\" the museum has produced 18 thematic \"mega-exhibitions\" (as of 2012); added The Jim Rouse Visionary Center (in 2004) which more than doubled its exhibition space and provided an expansive, permanent home to its education department; and added new features to the Baltimore cultural landscape (including the Hughes Family Outdoor Theater, the LeRoy Hoffberger Speaker's Corner, and more).

neighborhood at 800 [[Key Highway]]. The museum specializes in the preservation and display of [[outsider art]] (also known as \"intuitive art,\" \"raw art,\" or \"art brut\"). The city agreed to give the museum a piece of land on the south shore of the [[Inner Harbor]] under the condition that its organizers would clean up residual pollution from a copper paint factory and a whiskey warehouse that formerly occupied the site. It has been designated by [[United States Congress|Congress]] as America's national museum for [[self-taught art]].\n\nAVAM's 1.1 acre campus contains 67,000 square feet of exhibition space and a permanent collection of approximately 4,000 pieces.<ref>{{cite web|title=AVAM: Museum History|url=http://www.avam.org/stuff-everyone-asks/museum-history.shtml}}</ref> The permanent collection includes works by visionary artists like [[Ho Baron]], [[Nek Chand]], [[Howard Finster]], [[Vanessa German]], ''[[Mr. Imagination]]'' (aka Gregory Warmack), [[Leonard Knight]], [[William Kurelek]], [[Leo Sewell]], [[Judith Scott (artist)|Judith Scott]], [[Ben Wilson (artist)|Ben Wilson]], as well as over 40 pieces from the [[Cabaret Mechanical Theatre|Cabaret Mechanical Theatre of London]]. AVAM artists, the museum boasts, include \u201cfarmers, housewives, mechanics, the disabled, the homeless. . . all inspired by the fire within.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Art with a Heart|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2019/4/5/art-with-a-heart |website=The Attic|accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref> The museum's Main Building features three floors of exhibition space, and the campus includes a Tall Sculpture Barn and Wildflower Garden, along with large exhibition and event spaces in the Jim Rouse Visionary Center.\n\nThe museum has no staff [[curator]]s, preferring to use guest curators for its shows. Rather than focusing shows on specific artists or styles, it sponsors themed exhibitions with titles such as ''Wind in Your Hair'' and ''High on Life''. The museum's founder, [[Rebecca Alban Hoffberger]], takes pride in the fact that AVAM is \"pretty un-museumy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimorechronicle.com/wind_in_hair.html |title=Visionary Arts Museum Shows \"Wind in My Hair\" |publisher=Baltimorechronicle.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe founder and director of the AVAM is [[Rebecca Alban Hoffberger]], who while working in the development department of Sinai Hospital's (Baltimore) People Encouraging People (a program geared toward aiding psychiatric patients in their return to the community) began to develop the idea for a visionary museum, an idea that eventually blossomed into the American Visionary Art Museum, or AVAM. Initially, Hoffberger was simply interested in the artwork created by the patients in the People Encouraging People program, and found herself \u201cimpressed with their imagination\u201d and looking to \u201ctheir strengths, not their illnesses.\u201d\n\nHoffberger found inspiration on a visit to the [[Collection de l'art brut]] in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, which was established by French artist [[Jean Dubuffet]] as a collection of \u201cl'art brut\u201d or \u201craw art because of the untamed emotions resonating in it.\u201d Hoffberger described the museum as \u201cthe best, the most imaginative, the most original museum\u201d and soon adopted the idea of \u201cl'art brut\u201d for her own visionary museum.\n\nTo gauge the community's interest in visionary art, Hoffberger and gallery owner George Ciscle held an exhibit in 1987 titled \u201cAmerican Outsider Art,\u201d at which point she formally announced her plans for the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore. With the support of her friends and family, Hoffberger petitioned the city of Baltimore and was eventually awarded two buildings near the city's Inner Harbor worth $1.1 million. Hoffberger has said that she \u201cpublicly bent over backwards to not go to traditional art funders.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Currie|first=Donya|title=Vision Quest|url=http://www.marylandlife.com/reviews/vision-quest/page-2.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129015838/http://www.marylandlife.com/reviews/vision-quest/page-2.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-29|newspaper=Maryland Life}}</ref> The State of Maryland also issued $1.3 million in bonds to finance the construction, which helped jump-start the building process. Hoffberger also relied heavily on contributions and donations, a tradition that continues to keep the museum running today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msa.md.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/014500/014534/html/14534bio.html |title=Rebecca Alban Hoffberger, MSA SC 3520-14534 |publisher=Msa.md.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15}}</ref> Hoffberger raised $7 million in six years from donors such as [[Anita Roddick]].

Visionary artists Gerald Hawkes and Vollis Simpson were the first people to step through the doors.\n\nIn collaboration with the event's founder, Hobart Brown, AVAM brought the [[Kinetic Sculpture Race]] to the East coast in 1999. In 2004 the museum opened its third building, the Jim Rouse Visionary Center, converted from a former whiskey warehouse. The Jim Rouse Visionary Center houses such items as Kinetic Sculptures from AVAM's annual race, Baltimore painted screens, Leonard Knight's \u201cLove Balloon,\u201d DeVon Smith's \u201cWorld\u2019s First Robot Family,\u201d and an interactive display of automata from London's Cabaret Mechanical Theatre. It also features two classrooms and a 3rd floor banquet room that can accommodate up to 400 people for the museum's programs & engagements, as well as private rentals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avam.org/exhibitions/jrvc.shtml|title=James Rouse Visionary Center}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, AVAM began its popular \u201cFlicks from the Hill\u201d series with generous support from the Hughes family. Each summer, the free, outdoor family film series features a selection of movies inspired by the museum's current thematic exhibition. The films are projected on a large screen mounted below artist Adam Kurtzman's \u201cGiant Golden Hand\u201d in \u201cThe Hughes Family Outdoor Theater,\u201d and the natural amphitheater of Federal Hill can seat more than 1000 visitors for this popular outdoor film series.\n\nThe museum's many other programs include a summer arts camp and after-school program, established in 2009. AVAM is also a popular venue for weddings, hosting over 70 weddings annually. Rental/admission fees accounted for 72% of earned income in 2011, nearly three times the average for an art museum.<ref>{{cite news|last=Currie|first=Donya|title=Vision Quest|url=http://www.marylandlife.com/reviews/vision-quest/page-2.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129015838/http://www.marylandlife.com/reviews/vision-quest/page-2.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-29|newspaper=Maryland Life}}</ref>  AVAM is seeking to raise a $25 million endowment before \u201cexploring the many offers to establish a West coast branch.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=AVAM: Museum History|url=http://www.avam.org/stuff-everyone-asks/museum-history.shtml}}</ref>\n\n==Mission==\n\nHoffberger has said that \u201ca good museum does more than just have objects that stand there on pedestals.

Despite this, the museum won the support of collectors, critics, and the public through its exhibitions that examine the relationship of art to the human condition rather than to the canon of [[art history]]. In her inaugural address, Hoffberger stated that \u201cthe American Visionary Art Museum opens its doors of perception not in an effort to make war on academic or institutionalized learning, but to create a place where the best of self-taught, intuitive contributions of all kinds will be duly recognized, explored, and then championed in a clear strong voice.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=AVAM: Inaugural Address|url=http://www.avam.org/stuff-everyone-asks/inaugural-address.shtml}}</ref> Since its designation\u2014by a unanimous vote of the U.S. Congress\u2014as America's \"official national education center, repository and museum for self-taught, intuitive artistry,\" the museum has produced 18 thematic \"mega-exhibitions\" (as of 2012); added The Jim Rouse Visionary Center (in 2004) which more than doubled its exhibition space and provided an expansive, permanent home to its education department; and added new features to the Baltimore cultural landscape (including the Hughes Family Outdoor Theater, the LeRoy Hoffberger Speaker's Corner, and more).

It was released on April 19, 1994, by [[Columbia Records]]. After signing with the label with the help of [[MC Serch]], Nas recorded the album in 1992 and 1993 at [[Chung King Studios]], [[D&D Studios|D&D Recording]], Battery Studios, and [[Unique Recording Studios]] in New York City. The album's production was handled by [[DJ Premier]], [[Large Professor]], [[Pete Rock]], [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]], [[L.E.S. (producer)|L.E.S.]] and Nas himself. Styled as a [[hardcore hip hop]] album, ''Illmatic'' features multi-syllabic [[internal rhyme]]s and inner-city narratives based on Nas' experiences in [[Queensbridge, Queens|Queensbridge, New York]].\n\nThe album debuted at number 12 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 59,000 copies in its first week. However, its initial sales fell below expectations and its five singles failed to achieve significant chart success. Despite the album's low initial sales, ''Illmatic'' received rave reviews from most music critics, who praised its production and Nas' lyricism. On January 17, 1996, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], and on December 11, 2001, it earned a platinum certification after shipping 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The album has sold 2 million copies in the United States as of February 6, 2019.\n\nSince its initial reception, ''Illmatic'' has been recognized by writers and music critics as a landmark album in [[East Coast hip hop]].

At the time, the assembly of big-name producers was unprecedented, since most hip hop albums had primarily been the work of one dedicated producer and sometimes an embedded production team.<ref name=\"cowie\" /> Yet author Adam Mansbach reflects on the impact of ''Illmatic''{{'}}s noteworthy producers, writing: \"The psychological impact on the listener of having all these elite producers \u2013 some of whom, like Q-Tip, really weren't known yet for doing outside production work at all \u2013 coming together to lace the debut of this kid from Queensbridge was tremendous.\"<ref name=\"Sohail 13\" /> This same [[Wiktionary:Template|template]] would also be used by other successful East Coast rappers.

That formula, most successfully mined by the late Notorious B.I.G.

In an article titled, \"How Nas' \"Illmatic\" Ruined Hip-Hop,\" Insanul Ahmed of ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' argues that one \"unintended consequence\" of ''Illmatic'' was the overall decline in the cohesion and quality of rap albums: \"Next thing you knew, rap albums started having a different producer for every song.

In an April 2006 article, an ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' columnist wrote of the history and impact of the Queensbridge hip hop scene, stating \"Since the 1980s, New York City's Queensbridge Housing Projects has been documented perhaps better than any other geographic location. Starting with super producer Marley Marl's dominant Juice Crew in the '80s all the way through '90s mainstays like Nas, [[Cormega]] and [[Capone]], the Bridge has produced the highest per-capita talent of any 'hood.\"<ref>[http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=1080 XXLmag.com | Hip-Hop On A Higher Level | \u00bb Mobb Deep's Queensbridge Classics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210141845/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=1080 |date=December 10, 2008 }}.

According to Nas: \"I was coming from the legacy of Marley Marl, MC Shan, [[Juice Crew]] kind of vibe. Knowing these guys out in the neighborhood. At that time, the Queensbridge scene was dead. Dropping that album right there said a lot for me to carry on the legacy of the Queensbridge pioneers.\"<ref name=\"Rakim\"/>\n\nFollowing ''Illmatic'''s release, Queensbridge returned to prominence after years of obscurity, with the ascendancy of the influential [[hardcore rap]] group, [[Mobb Deep]] (who gained credibility due to their affiliation with Nas) and later with the emergence of the trend-setting duo, [[Capone-n-Noreaga]].<ref name=\"cowie\" /> Nas appeared on Mobb Deep's critically acclaimed studio album ''[[The Infamous]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"cowie\" /> Furthermore, the album is credited with launching the career of the [[East New York]]-based rapper, [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]]. AZ, who gained instant exposure and underground credibility due to his appearance on \"Life's a Bitch\", became a frequent collaborator of Nas, who appeared on his debut album ''[[Doe or Die]]'' (1995).\n\n==== Decline of alternative hip hop ====\n''Illmatic'' was one of the first major recordings to emerge from New York's burgeoning [[hardcore hip hop]] scene, at a time when much of East Coast hip hop was still dominated by [[alternative hip hop]] acts such as [[A Tribe Called Quest]] and [[De La Soul]] (groups often known for their [[jazz]]-inspired production and playful sensibilities). Adam Heimlich of The ''[[New York Press]]'' comments on the appeal of alternative hip-hop in [[Music of New York City|New York City's music scene]], and points out that, \"In 1994, there appeared likely to be more money (and definitely more cultural rewards) in working with [[Arrested Development (hip hop group)|Arrested Development]] or [[Digable Planets]].\"<ref name=\"heimlich\" /> Yet according to Heimlich, ''Illmatic'' provided an \"explosive, explicit rejection of the [[cultural assimilation]] of most previous hip-hop,\" due to its rugged use of language and its uncompromising portrayal of crime.<ref name=\"heimlich\">Heimlich, Adam.

In the 2009 essay \"Born Alone, Die Alone,\" she recounts the album's impact on West Coast artist, [[Tupac Shakur]].<ref name=\"Hampton\"/> While working as a journalist for ''The Source'' in 1994, Hampton covered three court cases involving Tupac. Around this time, she received an advance-copy of ''Illmatic'' and immediately dubbed a cassette version for Tupac, who became \"an instant convert\" of the album. The next day, she writes, Tupac \"arrived in his assigned courtroom blasting ''Illmatic'' so loudly that the [[bailiff]] yelled at him to turn it off before the judge took his seat on the bench.\" In her essay, Hampton implies that Nas' lyricism might have influenced Tupac's acclaimed album, ''[[Me Against the World]]'', which was recorded that same year.<ref name=\"Hampton\"/>\n\nWest Coast artist [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] also recounts the impact of ''Illmatic'' for fans like himself outside of New York. In his collaboration with Nas on \"[[Hustlers (song)|Hustlers]]\" (2006), he retells an episode taking place during his youth, where he decided to [[shoplift]] both ''Illmatic'' and ''The Chronic'': \"1995, eleven years from the day/I'm in the record shop with choices to make ''Illmatic'' on the top shelf, ''The Chronic'' on the left, homie/Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me/So fuck it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub-sack/Ripped the package of ''Illmatic'' and bumped that/For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhymed/I was the only [[Compton, California|Compton]] nigga with a [[N.Y.

In 2009, as part of the [[33\u2153]] book series, author Matthew Gasteier published a [[deconstruction]] of ''Illmatic'', that focuses on the dualities that inform its narratives. In 2012, playwright Shaun Neblett created a tribute play titled ''Homage 3: Illmatic'', which tells the story of an aspiring artist and explores the themes found in Nas' debut.<ref name=\"Interview\">[http://www.thestarklife.com/2011/11/23/homage-3-illmatic-hip-hop-theater/  H3 ILLMATIC: Hip-Hop Theater] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226181144/http://www.thestarklife.com/2011/11/23/homage-3-illmatic-hip-hop-theater/ |date=December 26, 2012 }} Retrieved April 5, 2013</ref> \"[A]s its title suggests,\" writes one reviewer, \"...the play is completely based on and acts as a tribute to Nas' ''Illmatic'' album.

No doubt these were great albums, coming at a moment when hip hop was cutting its teeth on social commentary and refining its ear on dusty breaks, hard snares, and sonic mayhem. But there is something about ''Illmatic'' that transcends the categories that have ever existed about hip-hop. Something complex about its simplicity, something elusive that we felt we wanted to explore.

As music critic Jeff Weiss writes,  \u201c''Illmatic'' is the [[gold standard]] that [[boom bap|boom-bap]] [[Wiktionary:connoisseur|connoisseurs]] refer to in the same way that [[Baby Boomer]]s talk about ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]''. The evidence they point to when they want to say: this is how good it can be.\u201d<ref name=\"Jeff\"/> ''New York Times'' columnist Jon Caramanica also credits the album with inadvertently spawning hip hop's [[counterculture]]. \"''Illmatic''\" he writes, \"mobilized a national network of dissidents craving something true to the streets but eager to distance themselves from what was beginning to be perceived as a scourge \u2013 [[gangster rap]].\" According to Caramanica, Nas' debut was received by these fans as a \"rebuke\" towards trends that were beginning to shape mainstream rap: \"the pop crossover, the exuberant production values, [and] the splintering of rap into [[Wiktionary:blithe|blithe]] and concerned wings.\"<ref name=\"Sohail D 255\"/>\n\nFor this reason, Caramanica considers ''Illmatic'' to be \"unusually significant to the intellectual development of the [hip-hop] genre\" yet he also remains critical of the divisiveness spawned by its \"zealots.\"<ref name=\"Sohail D 255\" /> In his essay, \"'Night Time is More Trife Than Ever': The Many Misuses of Nas,\" he writes: \"''Illmatic'' is responsible for countless pointless 'rap versus hip-hop debates,' a shocking amount of hip-hop self-righteousness, the emergence of the backpack movement as something more than a regional [[Wiktionary:curio|curio]], and the persistence of the idea that lyricism is the only standard great rap music should be held to.\"<ref name=\"Sohail D 255\" /> Commenting on these polarized debates, Jeff Weiss suggests that ''Illmatic'' is \"best heard by ignoring the dogma, [[culture war]]s, Nas clones, and would-be saviors that have accreted since April of 1994. Who cares whether it's the greatest rap album of all-time or not?

It was released on April 19, 1994, by [[Columbia Records]]. After signing with the label with the help of [[MC Serch]], Nas recorded the album in 1992 and 1993 at [[Chung King Studios]], [[D&D Studios|D&D Recording]], Battery Studios, and [[Unique Recording Studios]] in New York City. The album's production was handled by [[DJ Premier]], [[Large Professor]], [[Pete Rock]], [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]], [[L.E.S. (producer)|L.E.S.]] and Nas himself. Styled as a [[hardcore hip hop]] album, ''Illmatic'' features multi-syllabic [[internal rhyme]]s and inner-city narratives based on Nas' experiences in [[Queensbridge, Queens|Queensbridge, New York]].\n\nThe album debuted at number 12 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 59,000 copies in its first week. However, its initial sales fell below expectations and its five singles failed to achieve significant chart success. Despite the album's low initial sales, ''Illmatic'' received rave reviews from most music critics, who praised its production and Nas' lyricism. On January 17, 1996, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], and on December 11, 2001, it earned a platinum certification after shipping 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The album has sold 2 million copies in the United States as of February 6, 2019.\n\nSince its initial reception, ''Illmatic'' has been recognized by writers and music critics as a landmark album in [[East Coast hip hop]]. Its influence on subsequent hip hop artists has been attributed to the album's production and Nas' lyricism. It also contributed to the [[East Coast Renaissance|revival of the New York City rap scene]], introducing a number of stylistic trends to the region. The album is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time, appearing on numerous best album lists by critics and publications.<ref name=\"about1\">{{cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/top10albums/ss/EssentialAlbums_10.htm |title=Top 10 Essential Hip-Hop Albums \u2013 10 Essential Rap/Hip-Hop Albums |publisher=Rap.about.com |date=2014-04-09 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}</ref><ref>Petrusich, Amanda.

AZ, who gained instant exposure and underground credibility due to his appearance on \"Life's a Bitch\", became a frequent collaborator of Nas, who appeared on his debut album ''[[Doe or Die]]'' (1995).\n\n==== Decline of alternative hip hop ====\n''Illmatic'' was one of the first major recordings to emerge from New York's burgeoning [[hardcore hip hop]] scene, at a time when much of East Coast hip hop was still dominated by [[alternative hip hop]] acts such as [[A Tribe Called Quest]] and [[De La Soul]] (groups often known for their [[jazz]]-inspired production and playful sensibilities). Adam Heimlich of The ''[[New York Press]]'' comments on the appeal of alternative hip-hop in [[Music of New York City|New York City's music scene]], and points out that, \"In 1994, there appeared likely to be more money (and definitely more cultural rewards) in working with [[Arrested Development (hip hop group)|Arrested Development]] or [[Digable Planets]].\"<ref name=\"heimlich\" /> Yet according to Heimlich, ''Illmatic'' provided an \"explosive, explicit rejection of the [[cultural assimilation]] of most previous hip-hop,\" due to its rugged use of language and its uncompromising portrayal of crime.<ref name=\"heimlich\">Heimlich, Adam.

Along with Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and [[Mobb Deep]]. . . all but invented 90s New York rap, back when the notion of an 'East Coast [[gangsta rap|gangsta]]' still meant [[Schoolly D]] or [[Kool G. Rap]]. Those three ... designed the manner and style in which New York artists would address what [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop]] and [[Dr. Dre|Dre]] had made rap's hottest topics: drugs and violence.\"<ref name=\"heimlich\"/> Similarly, [[Duke University]] Professor, Mark Anthony Neal, writes, \"Nas was at the forefront of a [[East Coast Renaissance|renaissance of East Coast hip hop]]\" in which \"...&nbsp;a distinct East Coast style of so-called [[gangsta rap]] appeared,\" as heard in similarly styled recordings such as Wu-Tang Clan's \u201c[[C.R.E.A.M.]]\u201d and [[Notorious B.I.G.]]'s \"Everyday Struggle\".<ref name=\"Sohail 13\" /> Steve Huey of [[Allmusic]] concludes that while ''Illmatic'' contains strong elements of [[jazz rap]], it nonetheless signaled a major regional shift towards hardcore aesthetics, marking \"the beginning of a shift away from [[Native Tongues]]-inspired alternative rap.\"<ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\n==== West Coast hip hop ====\nThe critical acclaim surrounding the album also helped to shift attention away from the melodious, [[synthesizer|synth]]-driven, and [[funk]]-induced [[G-funk]] subgenre, which dominated the charts for some time after [[Dr. Dre]]'s ''[[The Chronic]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"nas\">[http://www.hiponline.com/artist/music/n/nas Biography: Nas].</ref> Citing the example of [[Snoop Dogg]]'s wildly popular ''[[Doggystyle]]'' (released six months prior to Nas' debut) author Matthew Gasteier writes, \"The first thing immediately noticeable about the [Source magazine] review, is that, like essentially every other review about ''Illmatic'' in publications like ''Vibe'', ''Spin'', ''Rolling Stones'', and ''The New York Times'', it mentions Snoop Doggy Dogg's ''Doggystyle'' in the first paragraph.\"<ref name=\"Gasteier\" /> That nearly every reviewer felt the need to contextualize their response to ''Illmatic'' within the frame of West Coast G-Funk \"is a reminder of just how pervasive the style was within the hip hop world and the music community as a whole.\"<ref name=\"Gasteier\"/>\n\nYet according to writer Mickey Hess, ''Illmatic'' was among those East Coast records that helped \"create sparse, rough and rugged soundscapes that clearly differed from Dre's multi-layered melodies.\"<ref name=\"icons\">''Icons of Hip Hop''.

In the 2009 essay \"Born Alone, Die Alone,\" she recounts the album's impact on West Coast artist, [[Tupac Shakur]].<ref name=\"Hampton\"/> While working as a journalist for ''The Source'' in 1994, Hampton covered three court cases involving Tupac. Around this time, she received an advance-copy of ''Illmatic'' and immediately dubbed a cassette version for Tupac, who became \"an instant convert\" of the album. The next day, she writes, Tupac \"arrived in his assigned courtroom blasting ''Illmatic'' so loudly that the [[bailiff]] yelled at him to turn it off before the judge took his seat on the bench.\" In her essay, Hampton implies that Nas' lyricism might have influenced Tupac's acclaimed album, ''[[Me Against the World]]'', which was recorded that same year.<ref name=\"Hampton\"/>\n\nWest Coast artist [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] also recounts the impact of ''Illmatic'' for fans like himself outside of New York. In his collaboration with Nas on \"[[Hustlers (song)|Hustlers]]\" (2006), he retells an episode taking place during his youth, where he decided to [[shoplift]] both ''Illmatic'' and ''The Chronic'': \"1995, eleven years from the day/I'm in the record shop with choices to make ''Illmatic'' on the top shelf, ''The Chronic'' on the left, homie/Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me/So fuck it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub-sack/Ripped the package of ''Illmatic'' and bumped that/For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhymed/I was the only [[Compton, California|Compton]] nigga with a [[N.Y.

Why not [[Boogie Down Productions]]' ''[[Criminal Minded]]'', [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back|It Takes a Nation to Hold Us Back]]'', or [[Ice Cube]]'s ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]''? No doubt these were great albums, coming at a moment when hip hop was cutting its teeth on social commentary and refining its ear on dusty breaks, hard snares, and sonic mayhem. But there is something about ''Illmatic'' that transcends the categories that have ever existed about hip-hop. Something complex about its simplicity, something elusive that we felt we wanted to explore. Straight up though, ''Illmatic'' is just a dope album, embodying everything that is hip-hop while mastering what matters most: beats and rhymes.<ref name=\"Sohail 13\" />}}\n\n==== Hip hop debates ====\n''Illmatic'' has also helped to shape the attitudes and perceptions of hip hop fans, who cherish it as a music template that defines the genre's conventions. As music critic Jeff Weiss writes,  \u201c''Illmatic'' is the [[gold standard]] that [[boom bap|boom-bap]] [[Wiktionary:connoisseur|connoisseurs]] refer to in the same way that [[Baby Boomer]]s talk about ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]''. The evidence they point to when they want to say: this is how good it can be.\u201d<ref name=\"Jeff\"/> ''New York Times'' columnist Jon Caramanica also credits the album with inadvertently spawning hip hop's [[counterculture]]. \"''Illmatic''\" he writes, \"mobilized a national network of dissidents craving something true to the streets but eager to distance themselves from what was beginning to be perceived as a scourge \u2013 [[gangster rap]].\" According to Caramanica, Nas' debut was received by these fans as a \"rebuke\" towards trends that were beginning to shape mainstream rap: \"the pop crossover, the exuberant production values, [and] the splintering of rap into [[Wiktionary:blithe|blithe]] and concerned wings.\"<ref name=\"Sohail D 255\"/>\n\nFor this reason, Caramanica considers ''Illmatic'' to be \"unusually significant to the intellectual development of the [hip-hop] genre\" yet he also remains critical of the divisiveness spawned by its \"zealots.\"<ref name=\"Sohail D 255\" /> In his essay, \"'Night Time is More Trife Than Ever': The Many Misuses of Nas,\" he writes: \"''Illmatic'' is responsible for countless pointless 'rap versus hip-hop debates,' a shocking amount of hip-hop self-righteousness, the emergence of the backpack movement as something more than a regional [[Wiktionary:curio|curio]], and the persistence of the idea that lyricism is the only standard great rap music should be held to.\"<ref name=\"Sohail D 255\" /> Commenting on these polarized debates, Jeff Weiss suggests that ''Illmatic'' is \"best heard by ignoring the dogma, [[culture war]]s, Nas clones, and would-be saviors that have accreted since April of 1994. Who cares whether it's the greatest rap album of all-time or not? It's an example of how great rap can be, but not necessarily the way it should be.\"<ref name=\"Jeff\"/>'\n\n=== Subsequent work by Nas ===\n[[File:Nas SXSW 2012.jpg|right|thumb|Nas at [[South by Southwest]] in 2012, where he performed the album in its entirety.]]\n\nWhile its success helped Nas' career immeasurably, hip hop aficionados have cited the album as his inextricable \"gift and curse\".<ref name=\"hess\"/><ref name=\"Hill\" /> Due to its critical fame, Nas' subsequent studio albums have been [[sophomore slump|weighed against]] ''Illmatic'', despite all of them outselling his debut.<ref name=\"hess\"/> Against this standard, they are often critically deemed as mediocre follow-ups.<ref name=\"Hill\" /> After manager [[Steve Stoute]] convinced Nas to aim his efforts in a more commercial direction for his follow-up album ''[[It Was Written]]'' (1996), he enlisted the production team [[Trackmasters]], who were known for their mainstream work at the time.<ref name=\"cowie\"/> It was criticized for its embrace of [[Gangsta rap|gangsta/mafioso]] themes and materialistic subject matter, but proved to be a commercial success, selling over three million copies.<ref name=\"cowie\"/> Critics gave it mixed reviews, and general consensus was that it failed to live up to the classic status of ''Illmatic''.<ref>[http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=9983 Sputnikmusic: Staff Review \u2013 It Was Written]. Sputnikmusic.com. Retrieved on February 11, 2009.</ref> Many fans of ''Illmatic'' labeled his subsequent efforts as '[[selling out]]', due to his crossover sensibilities (e.g. his participation with the hip hop group [[The Firm (hip hop group)|The Firm]]) and radio-friendly hits aimed at the pop charts, such as \"[[If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)]]\" (1996) and \"[[Hate Me Now]]\" (1999).<ref name=\"cowie\"/>\n\nWhen he released his third and fourth studio albums, ''[[I Am\u2026 (Nas album)|I Am\u2026]]'' and ''[[Nastradamus]]'' (1999), which underwent editing due to bootlegging of the recording sessions,<ref name=\"cowie\"/> many fans and critics feared that his career was deteriorating, as both albums received further criticism for their commercially oriented sound.<ref name=\"cowie\"/> Reflecting this widespread perception in the hip hop community and adding to his ongoing feud with Nas at the time, Jay-Z mocked him in the song \"[[Takeover (song)|Takeover]]\" (2001) for having a \"one hot album [''Illmatic''] every ten year average\".<ref>Hinds, Selwyn Seyfu.

He was the creator of ''Dealer McDope'' and ''[[Tales from the Leather Nun]]'' and collaborated with [[Gilbert Shelton]] and [[Paul Mavrides]] on ''[[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in 1943 and raised in the [[Cleveland, Ohio]] area, Sheridan arrived in [[San Francisco]], California in 1969 after having graduated from the [[Cleveland Institute of Art]] and serving time in the military in Ethiopia. In California he collaborated with fellow [[Midwestern United States|midwesterner]] [[Fred Schrier]] as the \"Overland Vegetable Stagecoach\" on three issues of ''Mother's Oats Comix'', two of ''Meef Comix'', and a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] title called ''The Balloon Vendor'',  published by [[Rip Off Press]] and The [[Print Mint]].<ref>[http://lambiek.net/artists/s/sheridan_david.htm Sheridan entry], Lambiek Comiclopedia.]</ref> \n\nSheridan was the art editor for three issues of ''[[The Rip Off Review of Western Culture]]'' in 1972, a magazine published by the [[Rip Off Press]]. His solo comix work can be seen in ''[[Slow Death]], Skull Comix, Hydrogen Bomb and Biochemical Warfare Funnies #1, San Francisco Comic Book #1,'' ''[[Tales from the Leather Nun]]'', ''[[Rip Off Comix]]'', and ''[[High Times]]'', and in cartoons he made for the ''[[Berkeley Barb]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]''. He also did the art for  ''Weed and Wine'', the first mini-album produced by Cleveland area folk singer/songwriter [[John Bassette]], as well as album covers for Carl Oglesby, [[John Lee Hooker]], [[David Steinberg]], and [[Impulse! Records]].The \"Black Death Malt Liquor\" shirt regularly worn by [[Howard Hesseman]] on [[WKRP in Cincinnati]] in his role as [[Dr. Johnny Fever]] was designed and drawn by Sheridan.{{cn|date=October 2016}} His illustrations appeared in [[Ramparts (magazine)|''Ramparts'']], and he produced a series of  cannabis labels for the fictitious California Homegrowers Association (with cartoonist Pat Ryan).\n\nSheridan eventually settled in [[San Anselmo, California]]. There he became a member of the [[Artista]] collective, an artists collective with its own jackets and softball team. During the [[1972 Major League Baseball strike]], he appointed himself the head of the \"Scab League\", offering to have his team take the strikers' places for $100 per week and all the beer they could drink.<ref name=\"Liberatore\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marinij.com/ci_6004681|title=Liberatore: Work of Marin's late counterculture cartoonist Sheridan to be showcased|accessdate=January 20, 2008|author=Paul Liberatore|date=May 28, 2007|publisher=Marin Independent Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223155151/http://www.marinij.com/ci_6004681|archive-date=February 23, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also befriended and worked closely with comedian [[Don Novello]], drawing the album cover for Novello's [[Father Guido Sarducci]] \"Live at St. Douglas Convent\" comedy album. A characterization of Sarducci appeared in a Dealer McDope adventure, \"20,000 Kilos Beneath the Sea\" in ''Mother's Oats'' #3.{{issue|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1974, Sheridan began collaborating on [[Gilbert Shelton]]'s ''[[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]'' strips. These were [[Print syndication|syndicated]] by Rip Off Press to alternative and college weeklies nationwide, and later collected into comix and anthologies. His first issue of ''[[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]'' was #4, with a many-page story-arc entitled ''The Seventh Voyage of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers'': escaping the landlady and her demands for rent, the hirsute trio go to Mexico where they encounter far worse perils, including a [[Carlos Castaneda]] [[parody]]. Sheridan's detailed graphic style lent itself well to the fantastic imagery needed to [[parody|lampoon]] Castaneda's [[Psychoactive drug|drug]]-related [[Central America]]n-cum-[[New Age]] [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. He then continued to collaborate on the ''Freak Brothers'' comix series<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/freakbro.htm Toonopedia Website]</ref> through issues 5, 6 and 7;  the team was joined by [[Paul Mavrides]] in 1978 for issue #6. In all, Sheridan contributed to 45 Freak Brothers tales.\n\n==Death==\nSheridan was diagnosed with [[cancer]] on March 3, 1982, eight months after his July 4, 1981, marriage to Dava Stone. Sheridan died from a brain hemorrhage on March 28, 1982. He had been in a coma for four days at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco.

He was the creator of ''Dealer McDope'' and ''[[Tales from the Leather Nun]]'' and collaborated with [[Gilbert Shelton]] and [[Paul Mavrides]] on ''[[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in 1943 and raised in the [[Cleveland, Ohio]] area, Sheridan arrived in [[San Francisco]], California in 1969 after having graduated from the [[Cleveland Institute of Art]] and serving time in the military in Ethiopia. In California he collaborated with fellow [[Midwestern United States|midwesterner]] [[Fred Schrier]] as the \"Overland Vegetable Stagecoach\" on three issues of ''Mother's Oats Comix'', two of ''Meef Comix'', and a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] title called ''The Balloon Vendor'',  published by [[Rip Off Press]] and The [[Print Mint]].<ref>[http://lambiek.net/artists/s/sheridan_david.htm Sheridan entry], Lambiek Comiclopedia.]</ref> \n\nSheridan was the art editor for three issues of ''[[The Rip Off Review of Western Culture]]'' in 1972, a magazine published by the [[Rip Off Press]]. His solo comix work can be seen in ''[[Slow Death]], Skull Comix, Hydrogen Bomb and Biochemical Warfare Funnies #1, San Francisco Comic Book #1,'' ''[[Tales from the Leather Nun]]'', ''[[Rip Off Comix]]'', and ''[[High Times]]'', and in cartoons he made for the ''[[Berkeley Barb]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]''. He also did the art for  ''Weed and Wine'', the first mini-album produced by Cleveland area folk singer/songwriter [[John Bassette]], as well as album covers for Carl Oglesby, [[John Lee Hooker]], [[David Steinberg]], and [[Impulse! Records]].The \"Black Death Malt Liquor\" shirt regularly worn by [[Howard Hesseman]] on [[WKRP in Cincinnati]] in his role as [[Dr. Johnny Fever]] was designed and drawn by Sheridan.{{cn|date=October 2016}} His illustrations appeared in [[Ramparts (magazine)|''Ramparts'']], and he produced a series of  cannabis labels for the fictitious California Homegrowers Association (with cartoonist Pat Ryan).\n\nSheridan eventually settled in [[San Anselmo, California]]. There he became a member of the [[Artista]] collective, an artists collective with its own jackets and softball team. During the [[1972 Major League Baseball strike]], he appointed himself the head of the \"Scab League\", offering to have his team take the strikers' places for $100 per week and all the beer they could drink.<ref name=\"Liberatore\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marinij.com/ci_6004681|title=Liberatore: Work of Marin's late counterculture cartoonist Sheridan to be showcased|accessdate=January 20, 2008|author=Paul Liberatore|date=May 28, 2007|publisher=Marin Independent Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223155151/http://www.marinij.com/ci_6004681|archive-date=February 23, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also befriended and worked closely with comedian [[Don Novello]], drawing the album cover for Novello's [[Father Guido Sarducci]] \"Live at St. Douglas Convent\" comedy album. A characterization of Sarducci appeared in a Dealer McDope adventure, \"20,000 Kilos Beneath the Sea\" in ''Mother's Oats'' #3.{{issue|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1974, Sheridan began collaborating on [[Gilbert Shelton]]'s ''[[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]'' strips. These were [[Print syndication|syndicated]] by Rip Off Press to alternative and college weeklies nationwide, and later collected into comix and anthologies. His first issue of ''[[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]'' was #4, with a many-page story-arc entitled ''The Seventh Voyage of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers'': escaping the landlady and her demands for rent, the hirsute trio go to Mexico where they encounter far worse perils, including a [[Carlos Castaneda]] [[parody]]. Sheridan's detailed graphic style lent itself well to the fantastic imagery needed to [[parody|lampoon]] Castaneda's [[Psychoactive drug|drug]]-related [[Central America]]n-cum-[[New Age]] [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. He then continued to collaborate on the ''Freak Brothers'' comix series<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/freakbro.htm Toonopedia Website]</ref> through issues 5, 6 and 7;  the team was joined by [[Paul Mavrides]] in 1978 for issue #6. In all, Sheridan contributed to 45 Freak Brothers tales.\n\n==Death==\nSheridan was diagnosed with [[cancer]] on March 3, 1982, eight months after his July 4, 1981, marriage to Dava Stone. Sheridan died from a brain hemorrhage on March 28, 1982. He had been in a coma for four days at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco. He was buried at sea at a memorial service the following Friday.\n\nHis wife Dava gave birth to their daughter Dori on April 4, 1982, a week after Sheridan died.<ref name=\"Liberatore\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nA [http://www.fantagraphics.com/davesheridan/ full biography of Dave Sheridan], which reproduces most of his comix and graphics work, was published by [[Fantagraphics Books]] in 2018. \n\n==[[Fantagraphics Books|Bibliography]]==\n===Overland Vegetable Stagecoach===\n* ''Mother's Oats Comix'' No. 1 \u2013 San Francisco Comic Book Company/Rip Off Press 1969\n* ''Mother's Oats Comix'' No. 2 \u2013 San Francisco Comic Book Company/Rip Off Press 1970\n* ''Skull Comics'' No. 1 (with [[Greg Irons]], [[Jaxon|Jack Jackson]] and [[Rory Hayes]]) \u2013 San Francisco Comic Book Company/Rip Off Press 1970\n* ''The Balloon Vendor'' \u2013 San Francisco Comic Book Company/Rip Off Press 1971\n* ''Meef Comix'' No. 1 \u2013 San Francisco Comic Book Company/Rip Off Press 1972\n* ''Meef Comix'' No. 2 \u2013 San Francisco Comic Book Company/Rip Off Press 1973\n* ''Tales of the Leather Nun'' No. 1 \u2013 [[Last Gasp]] Eco Funnies, 1973\n* ''Mindwarp: An Anthology'' by Sheridan & Schrier&nbsp;\u2014 [[And/Or Press]], 1975\n* ''Mother's Oats Comix'' No. 3 \u2013 San Francisco Comic Book Company/Rip Off Press 1976\n\n===Other===\n* ''[[Slow Death Funnies]]'' #1 (with Fred Schrier, Jim Osborne and Gilbert Shelton) \u2013 Last Gasp 1970\n* ''Slow Death Funnies'' #2 \"The Sex Evulsors of Tecnicus\" \u2013 Last Gasp 1970\n* ''The Food Stamp Gourmet'' by William Brown, Illustrations by Greg Irons, Gilbert Shelton, and Dave Sheridan&nbsp;\u2014 Bellerophon Books, 1971.\n* ''The Legion of Charlies'' by Tom Veitch, Greg Irons, and Dave Sheridan (Paperback) Last Gasp, 1971\n* '' Light Comitragies'' \u2013 Greg Irons&nbsp;\u2014 Print Mint 1971\n* ''Skull Comics'' No.s 2\u20135 \u2013 San Francisco Comic Book Company/Rip Off Press 1971\u20131972\n* ''[[Yellow Dog (comics)|Yellow Dog]]'' #19 (with Fred Schrier) \u2013 The Print Mint 1971\n* ''Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers'' issues 4, 5, 6 (with Paul Mavrides), and 7\n* ''Jayzey Lynch's Nard n' Pat'' No. 1 \"We Could Get Any Artist ta Draw Us!\" (1974)\n* ''U-Comix Sammelband Nr. 1'' (Introduction to Paperback) UPN-Volksverlag (1974)\n* ''U-Comix Sammelband Nr. 2'' (Introduction to Paperback) UPN-Volksverlag (1975)\n* ''The Seattle Simpleton'' (vol. 1 No. 3) \"The Mellow Cab Man\" (Freewheelin' Frank) and \"The Story of Phineas and the Organic Mechanic\", both by Shelton & Sheridan.
