The problem faced by the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington Route]] was that its main terminal in Chicago, [[Chicago Union Station]], charged the railroads serving it by the length of each train, and the Burlington wanted to avoid such charges. Because of the line's satisfaction with Budd's products, they approached Budd seeking a solution.\n\nBudd proposed to build coaches that were taller than the typical lightweight passenger car while keeping the streamline car's length of 85 feet, with the cars having a capacity 50% greater than previous commuter cars. To address the issue of the conductor collecting tickets without having to climb stairs, the upper level was designed with its center portion open so that the conductor could reach the tickets from upper-level passengers. Two rows of individual seats, one on each side of the car, provided the increase in seating capacity.\n\nThe unique design of the upper level's open center section led to the cars being called \"Gallery\" cars. Burlington approved the design and ordered 30 cars. These cars, built as Budd lot 9679-041, were delivered between August 1950 and January 1951 and not only marked a change in how the commuters were handled but also were the first cars in commuter service to have [[air conditioning]]. The Burlington retrofitted its earlier cars with air conditioning as well, once the new cars had entered service.\n\nWith the first of the new commuter cars in service on the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington]], the next railroad to approach Budd to design a new type of car with a greater seating capacity while also improving the accommodations for coach passengers was the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]].\n\nThe [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] was searching for a better design for its long-distance passenger trains and, with the design of the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington]] coaches in mind, Budd set out to create a similar passenger car design to meet the Santa Fe's needs. In September 1952, the Santa Fe placed an order for two two-level prototypes, Budd's Lot 9679-129. These, carrying the numbers 526 and 527, were delivered in July 1954, at which time both were placed into service for evaluation.\n\nThese two prototypes had seating on the both levels, stairs on one end to provide access to single-level cars, a stairway at the center of the car for access to toilets on the lower level, as well as the door in the side of the car for embarking and departing passengers. This lower floor also contained various mechanical and pneumatic equipment that otherwise would be mounted below the floors of single-level cars.\n\nWith the two [[Hi-Level]] prototypes in service and proving to not only meet the needs of line but also being popular with passengers who were afforded a much better view of the scenery from the upper level, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] again approached Budd with the idea of building additional two-level cars.\n\nThis time, in five different configurations: step-down coaches like the two prototype cars, convertible coaches which could have one end of the car converted from the high level on both ends to a step-down car as needed, coaches with both ends of the car having the end door at the upper level's height to provide access to adjoining passenger cars, dining cars and lounge cars (with kitchens on the lower level) which featured a partial glassed-in roof similar to the [[Big Dome]] lounge cars that were also built by Budd and delivered around the time the prototype [[Hi-Level]] cars were built.\n\nThe order for additional cars was placed in March 1955 for 10 68-seat step-down coaches (delivered between December 1955 and January 1956 and numbered 528 to 537), 25 72-seat Hi-Level coaches (delivered between January and April 1956 numbered 700 to 724), six 60-seat bar \u2013 lounge \u2013 news stand which also had a 26-seat lounge in the lower level (delivered between May and June 1956) and six 80-seat dining cars (delivered between June and August 1956 numbered 650 to 655).\n\nWith these cars delivered the Santa Fe re-equipped the [[El Capitan]], the only coach train operated between [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and also had some of the Hi-Level coaches being assigned to the [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]\u2013[[Galveston, Texas]] [[Texas Chief]]. An additional 12 step-down coaches, numbered 538 to 549, and 12 convertible coaches, numbered 725 to 736, which were ordered in November 1962 and delivered between December 1963 and April 1964.\n\n====Later years====\n[[File:BUDD Plate (1).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|The Budd company logo on the [[builder's plate]] in a [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[M1/M3 (railcar)|M3]] railcar.]]\n[[File:Izukyu 8000 Series EMU 011.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The Budd company license plate in a [[Tokyu Car Corporation]] railcar.]]\n\nBudd continued to build ''gallery'' passenger cars for [[Chicago]]-area commuter service on the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington Route]] (and [[Burlington Northern]] after the merger), [[Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad|Rock Island]], and [[Milwaukee Road]] lines during the 1960s and 1970s; most of these cars are still in service on today's [[Metra]] routes. What is more, the Santa Fe Hi-level cars were the inspiration for the [[Amtrak]] [[Superliner (railcar)|Superliner]] and [[Superliner II]] which ply the rails of Amtrak on many different routes even today, though they were not a product of Budd.\n\nStainless steel Budd cars originally built for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s 1955 train ''[[The Canadian]]'' are still in service with [[Via Rail|Via Rail Canada]]. Since 1951 two formations of six Budd cars operated by [[Ferrobaires]] have run a weekly service called \"El Marplatense\" from [[Buenos Aires]] to the ocean-side city of [[Mar del Plata]] in Buenos Aires Province, [[Argentina]]; the cars were originally built for the [[Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad]].\n\nBudd-patented processes and designs were also used in [[Brazil]] (by [[Mafersa]]), France and Belgium after World War II to construct [[SNCF]] electric-powered [[multiple-unit]] cars, [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] suburban trainsets, [[Wagons-Lits]] [CIWL] [[sleeping car]]s and even [[SNCF Class CC 40100]] a small class of SNCF and [[SNCB]] four-current six-axle high speed [[electric locomotive]]s for [[Trans Europ Express]] service between [[Paris]], [[Brussels]] and [[Amsterdam]] and SNCB class 56 EMU.\n\nIn Japan [[Tokyu Car Corporation]] became the licensee of the Budd process and made the Stainless steel commuter cars like Series 7000 of [[Tokyu Corporation|Tokyu]] line. [[Mafersa]] continued to manufacture cars based on Budd designs with 38 cars being built for [[Virginia Rail Express]] between 1990 and 1992, some now at [[Shore Line East]]. [[Canadian Vickers]] and [[Avco]] built cars and incomplete [[knock-down kit|kit shell]]s (for GE) under Budd license, including the 1980 PATCO Series II cars, [[Metro-North]] [[M2 (railcar)|M-2 Cosmopolitan]] and the Arrow II/III/Silverliner IV MUs.\n\nBudd also issued a licence to Australian manufacturer [[Commonwealth Engineering]] in [[Sydney]] where Budd's stainless steel technology was used between the late 1950s and 1989 to build a variety of projects including the Monocoque self steer [[NSW TrainLink V set|V set]] double-decker interurban electric multiple units considered by many to be one of the worlds most advanced double decker design. Budd's extensive research into the use of Stainless steel in rail carriage design and construction methodology carries on today in consulting businesses like Bay Rail.\n\n===Rail diesel car===\nIn 1949, Budd introduced the \"[[Rail Diesel Car]]\" (RDC), a stainless steel self-propelled \"train in one car\" which expanded rail service on lightly populated railway lines and provided an adaptable car for suburban commuter service. More than 300 RDCs were built, and some are still in service in Canada, the United States, Australia, Cuba and Saudi Arabia, with similar but shorter cars also being built under license by [[Mafersa]] in Brazil, which used the Budd [[Pioneer III (railcar)|Pioneer]] construction methods that the company designed and implemented in 1956 on some of the later commuter cars, such as the [[Milwaukee Road]] gallery cars that operated out of [[Chicago]] as well as [[electric multiple unit]] (EMU) high speed cars that operated between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[New York City]]. The final few RDC cars were built by Canadian Car & Foundry under licensed from Budd.\n\n===Electric multiple units===\n[[File:Long Island Rail Road.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|A Budd [[M1/M3 (railcar)|M1]] train on the [[Long Island Rail Road]].]]\nIn the late 1950s, Budd built the prototype [[Pioneer III (railcar)|Pioneer III]]. When re-designed and outfitted with electrical propulsion and end cabs as EMU coaches, six were purchased by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] who originally intended them for medium-distance use in PRR's electrified territory. In 1963, they became known as \"Silverliner I\" cars when their use was supplemented by the new ''[[Budd Silverliner|Silverliner II]]'' cars, which used an improved Pioneer III body, and which were placed into Philadelphia-area commuter rail service on the PRR and [[Reading Company]] lines.\n\nBudd was contracted in 1966 by the PRR and the U.S. Department of Commerce's \"Office of High-Speed Ground Transportation\" (prior to the establishment of USDOT) to build the original ''[[Budd Metroliner|Metroliner]]'' multiple unit cars for luxury high-speed service on the [[Northeast Corridor]]. The 50 original Metroliners were delivered in 1967\u201369. An additional 11 Metroliner coaches were built for SEPTA, but were not accepted for service until 1972 under Amtrak. The Metroliners have been either retired, rebuilt into coaches without the cabs, or de-powered and used as [[cab car]]s.\n\nThe Silverliner II cars had a top speed of {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, but ran at up to {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} when the PRR used them for Philadelphia-Harrisburg service. The ''Metroliner'' EMU cars operated at 110 to {{convert|125|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} but every car was tested up to at least {{convert|160|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, although breakdowns in the system led Amtrak to derate them to {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Since their retirement from regular service, Amtrak has used the ''Metroliner'' EMU coaches as cab-coaches on various services.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.budd-rdc.org/introduction.html|publisher=Budd-rdc.org|accessdate=14 July 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075846/http://www.budd-rdc.org/introduction.html|archivedate=24 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Subway cars===\n\nIn 1960, Budd manufactured the first stainless steel production subway cars for Philadelphia's [[Market-Frankford Line]]. 270 M-3 cars were jointly owned by the [[Philadelphia|City of Philadelphia]] and the [[Philadelphia Transportation Company]] (now [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority]]). Some rail enthusiasts nicknamed the cars \"Almond Joys\" because the four hump-shaped ventilators on the roof evoked the [[Almond Joy]] candy bar.\n\nThere were 46 single units and 112 \"married\" pairs. The pairs were a \"mixed marriage\" because the odd-numbered car came with [[General Electric]] motors and equipment and was permanently coupled to the even-numbered car, which had [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] motors and equipment. Two cars in this fleet were air conditioned.\n\nThese cars were replaced with more modern, air-conditioned M-4 units from 1997 to 1999. Some cars were transferred to the [[Norristown High Speed Line]] in the early 1990s. The cars had to be [[Bogie|re-trucked]], because the Norristown line is [[standard gauge]] (4' 8\u00bd\") while the Market-Frankford line is [[broad gauge]] (5' 2\u00bd\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Budd Company|url=http://www.mauspfeil.net/Budd_Company.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130714084709/http://www.mauspfeil.net/Budd_Company.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 July 2013|publisher=Mauspfeil.net|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIndustrial historian Jonathan Feldman has concluded that Budd, along with other \"old-line suppliers\" of subway cars, \"lacked advanced systems-integration know-how and the skills required to manage complex electrical systems and electronics.

It was designed to use AMC's existing chassis for the sporty-model market segment before the introduction of the [[Ford Mustang]]. The proposed car did not enter production.\n\nAn irony to the XR-400 story is that Budd tried to sell the idea to [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] first. In 1961, Budd combined a 1957 [[Ford Thunderbird]] body with a 1961 [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] chassis to produce a sporty convertible. When Ford turned them down, Budd shifted focus to AMC. Ford went on to base the Mustang on the Falcon chassis.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nIn 1965, Budd designed and manufactured a front [[disc brake]] system for [[Chrysler]], [[Chrysler Imperial|Imperial]] and full-size [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] and [[Dodge]] automobiles, used (optionally) for the 1966\u201368 model years.\n\n==Divisions and subsidiaries==\nBy the end of 1950s, Budd had the following divisions and subsidiaries, important suppliers of the U.S. aerospace and military industry:<ref name=\"AW-19591215\" />\n* '''Budd Lewyt Electronics, Inc.''' \u2014 special-purpose data processing systems; communications equipment; instrumentation; products for the environmental control of electronic equipment.\n* '''Tatnall Measuring Systems Division''' \u2014 physical testing equipment, metal film strain gages, standard and custom load cells, and a unique PhotoStress technique for direct strain measurements.\n* '''Continental-Diamond Fibre Corporation''' \u2014 special high-heat resistant materials for ablation applications, laminated and molded plastics, vulcanized fibre, and bonded mica in the form of sheets, rods, tubes and tapes.\n* '''Defense Division''' \u2014 advanced aerospace and atomics structures, coupling a broad research and engineering capability with extensive prototype and production facilities.\n* '''Nuclear Systems Division''' \u2014 gamma radiography equipment for non-destructive testing of airframes, providing beam, panoramic and internal exposures in shop and field.\n* '''Electronic Controls Section''' \u2014 monautronic resistance welding controls for the aircraft industry.\n\n==Final years of railcar production==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2016}}\n[[File:MTAM Millford-Mill-departing-train.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|A Budd-built [[Baltimore Metro Subway]] train]]\n[[File:Linha1SP.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|A Budd train built by Mafersa in [[S\u00e3o Paulo Metro]]]]\n\nBudd built two series of \"L\" cars for the [[Chicago Transit Authority]], the [[2200 series (CTA)|2200 series]] (1969&ndash;1970). and the [[2600 series (Chicago \"L\")|2600 series]] (1981&ndash;1987).

The problem faced by the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington Route]] was that its main terminal in Chicago, [[Chicago Union Station]], charged the railroads serving it by the length of each train, and the Burlington wanted to avoid such charges. Because of the line's satisfaction with Budd's products, they approached Budd seeking a solution.\n\nBudd proposed to build coaches that were taller than the typical lightweight passenger car while keeping the streamline car's length of 85 feet, with the cars having a capacity 50% greater than previous commuter cars. To address the issue of the conductor collecting tickets without having to climb stairs, the upper level was designed with its center portion open so that the conductor could reach the tickets from upper-level passengers. Two rows of individual seats, one on each side of the car, provided the increase in seating capacity.\n\nThe unique design of the upper level's open center section led to the cars being called \"Gallery\" cars. Burlington approved the design and ordered 30 cars. These cars, built as Budd lot 9679-041, were delivered between August 1950 and January 1951 and not only marked a change in how the commuters were handled but also were the first cars in commuter service to have [[air conditioning]]. The Burlington retrofitted its earlier cars with air conditioning as well, once the new cars had entered service.\n\nWith the first of the new commuter cars in service on the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington]], the next railroad to approach Budd to design a new type of car with a greater seating capacity while also improving the accommodations for coach passengers was the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]].\n\nThe [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] was searching for a better design for its long-distance passenger trains and, with the design of the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington]] coaches in mind, Budd set out to create a similar passenger car design to meet the Santa Fe's needs. In September 1952, the Santa Fe placed an order for two two-level prototypes, Budd's Lot 9679-129. These, carrying the numbers 526 and 527, were delivered in July 1954, at which time both were placed into service for evaluation.\n\nThese two prototypes had seating on the both levels, stairs on one end to provide access to single-level cars, a stairway at the center of the car for access to toilets on the lower level, as well as the door in the side of the car for embarking and departing passengers. This lower floor also contained various mechanical and pneumatic equipment that otherwise would be mounted below the floors of single-level cars.\n\nWith the two [[Hi-Level]] prototypes in service and proving to not only meet the needs of line but also being popular with passengers who were afforded a much better view of the scenery from the upper level, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] again approached Budd with the idea of building additional two-level cars.\n\nThis time, in five different configurations: step-down coaches like the two prototype cars, convertible coaches which could have one end of the car converted from the high level on both ends to a step-down car as needed, coaches with both ends of the car having the end door at the upper level's height to provide access to adjoining passenger cars, dining cars and lounge cars (with kitchens on the lower level) which featured a partial glassed-in roof similar to the [[Big Dome]] lounge cars that were also built by Budd and delivered around the time the prototype [[Hi-Level]] cars were built.\n\nThe order for additional cars was placed in March 1955 for 10 68-seat step-down coaches (delivered between December 1955 and January 1956 and numbered 528 to 537), 25 72-seat Hi-Level coaches (delivered between January and April 1956 numbered 700 to 724), six 60-seat bar \u2013 lounge \u2013 news stand which also had a 26-seat lounge in the lower level (delivered between May and June 1956) and six 80-seat dining cars (delivered between June and August 1956 numbered 650 to 655).\n\nWith these cars delivered the Santa Fe re-equipped the [[El Capitan]], the only coach train operated between [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and also had some of the Hi-Level coaches being assigned to the [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]\u2013[[Galveston, Texas]] [[Texas Chief]]. An additional 12 step-down coaches, numbered 538 to 549, and 12 convertible coaches, numbered 725 to 736, which were ordered in November 1962 and delivered between December 1963 and April 1964.\n\n====Later years====\n[[File:BUDD Plate (1).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|The Budd company logo on the [[builder's plate]] in a [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[M1/M3 (railcar)|M3]] railcar.]]\n[[File:Izukyu 8000 Series EMU 011.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The Budd company license plate in a [[Tokyu Car Corporation]] railcar.]]\n\nBudd continued to build ''gallery'' passenger cars for [[Chicago]]-area commuter service on the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington Route]] (and [[Burlington Northern]] after the merger), [[Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad|Rock Island]], and [[Milwaukee Road]] lines during the 1960s and 1970s; most of these cars are still in service on today's [[Metra]] routes. What is more, the Santa Fe Hi-level cars were the inspiration for the [[Amtrak]] [[Superliner (railcar)|Superliner]] and [[Superliner II]] which ply the rails of Amtrak on many different routes even today, though they were not a product of Budd.\n\nStainless steel Budd cars originally built for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s 1955 train ''[[The Canadian]]'' are still in service with [[Via Rail|Via Rail Canada]]. Since 1951 two formations of six Budd cars operated by [[Ferrobaires]] have run a weekly service called \"El Marplatense\" from [[Buenos Aires]] to the ocean-side city of [[Mar del Plata]] in Buenos Aires Province, [[Argentina]]; the cars were originally built for the [[Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad]].\n\nBudd-patented processes and designs were also used in [[Brazil]] (by [[Mafersa]]), France and Belgium after World War II to construct [[SNCF]] electric-powered [[multiple-unit]] cars, [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] suburban trainsets, [[Wagons-Lits]] [CIWL] [[sleeping car]]s and even [[SNCF Class CC 40100]] a small class of SNCF and [[SNCB]] four-current six-axle high speed [[electric locomotive]]s for [[Trans Europ Express]] service between [[Paris]], [[Brussels]] and [[Amsterdam]] and SNCB class 56 EMU.\n\nIn Japan [[Tokyu Car Corporation]] became the licensee of the Budd process and made the Stainless steel commuter cars like Series 7000 of [[Tokyu Corporation|Tokyu]] line. [[Mafersa]] continued to manufacture cars based on Budd designs with 38 cars being built for [[Virginia Rail Express]] between 1990 and 1992, some now at [[Shore Line East]]. [[Canadian Vickers]] and [[Avco]] built cars and incomplete [[knock-down kit|kit shell]]s (for GE) under Budd license, including the 1980 PATCO Series II cars, [[Metro-North]] [[M2 (railcar)|M-2 Cosmopolitan]] and the Arrow II/III/Silverliner IV MUs.\n\nBudd also issued a licence to Australian manufacturer [[Commonwealth Engineering]] in [[Sydney]] where Budd's stainless steel technology was used between the late 1950s and 1989 to build a variety of projects including the Monocoque self steer [[NSW TrainLink V set|V set]] double-decker interurban electric multiple units considered by many to be one of the worlds most advanced double decker design. Budd's extensive research into the use of Stainless steel in rail carriage design and construction methodology carries on today in consulting businesses like Bay Rail.\n\n===Rail diesel car===\nIn 1949, Budd introduced the \"[[Rail Diesel Car]]\" (RDC), a stainless steel self-propelled \"train in one car\" which expanded rail service on lightly populated railway lines and provided an adaptable car for suburban commuter service. More than 300 RDCs were built, and some are still in service in Canada, the United States, Australia, Cuba and Saudi Arabia, with similar but shorter cars also being built under license by [[Mafersa]] in Brazil, which used the Budd [[Pioneer III (railcar)|Pioneer]] construction methods that the company designed and implemented in 1956 on some of the later commuter cars, such as the [[Milwaukee Road]] gallery cars that operated out of [[Chicago]] as well as [[electric multiple unit]] (EMU) high speed cars that operated between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[New York City]]. The final few RDC cars were built by Canadian Car & Foundry under licensed from Budd.\n\n===Electric multiple units===\n[[File:Long Island Rail Road.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|A Budd [[M1/M3 (railcar)|M1]] train on the [[Long Island Rail Road]].]]\nIn the late 1950s, Budd built the prototype [[Pioneer III (railcar)|Pioneer III]]. When re-designed and outfitted with electrical propulsion and end cabs as EMU coaches, six were purchased by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] who originally intended them for medium-distance use in PRR's electrified territory. In 1963, they became known as \"Silverliner I\" cars when their use was supplemented by the new ''[[Budd Silverliner|Silverliner II]]'' cars, which used an improved Pioneer III body, and which were placed into Philadelphia-area commuter rail service on the PRR and [[Reading Company]] lines.\n\nBudd was contracted in 1966 by the PRR and the U.S. Department of Commerce's \"Office of High-Speed Ground Transportation\" (prior to the establishment of USDOT) to build the original ''[[Budd Metroliner|Metroliner]]'' multiple unit cars for luxury high-speed service on the [[Northeast Corridor]]. The 50 original Metroliners were delivered in 1967\u201369. An additional 11 Metroliner coaches were built for SEPTA, but were not accepted for service until 1972 under Amtrak. The Metroliners have been either retired, rebuilt into coaches without the cabs, or de-powered and used as [[cab car]]s.\n\nThe Silverliner II cars had a top speed of {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, but ran at up to {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} when the PRR used them for Philadelphia-Harrisburg service. The ''Metroliner'' EMU cars operated at 110 to {{convert|125|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} but every car was tested up to at least {{convert|160|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, although breakdowns in the system led Amtrak to derate them to {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Since their retirement from regular service, Amtrak has used the ''Metroliner'' EMU coaches as cab-coaches on various services.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.budd-rdc.org/introduction.html|publisher=Budd-rdc.org|accessdate=14 July 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075846/http://www.budd-rdc.org/introduction.html|archivedate=24 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Subway cars===\n\nIn 1960, Budd manufactured the first stainless steel production subway cars for Philadelphia's [[Market-Frankford Line]]. 270 M-3 cars were jointly owned by the [[Philadelphia|City of Philadelphia]] and the [[Philadelphia Transportation Company]] (now [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority]]). Some rail enthusiasts nicknamed the cars \"Almond Joys\" because the four hump-shaped ventilators on the roof evoked the [[Almond Joy]] candy bar.\n\nThere were 46 single units and 112 \"married\" pairs. The pairs were a \"mixed marriage\" because the odd-numbered car came with [[General Electric]] motors and equipment and was permanently coupled to the even-numbered car, which had [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] motors and equipment. Two cars in this fleet were air conditioned.\n\nThese cars were replaced with more modern, air-conditioned M-4 units from 1997 to 1999. Some cars were transferred to the [[Norristown High Speed Line]] in the early 1990s. The cars had to be [[Bogie|re-trucked]], because the Norristown line is [[standard gauge]] (4' 8\u00bd\") while the Market-Frankford line is [[broad gauge]] (5' 2\u00bd\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Budd Company|url=http://www.mauspfeil.net/Budd_Company.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130714084709/http://www.mauspfeil.net/Budd_Company.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 July 2013|publisher=Mauspfeil.net|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIndustrial historian Jonathan Feldman has concluded that Budd, along with other \"old-line suppliers\" of subway cars, \"lacked advanced systems-integration know-how and the skills required to manage complex electrical systems and electronics.

The proposed car did not enter production.\n\nAn irony to the XR-400 story is that Budd tried to sell the idea to [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] first. In 1961, Budd combined a 1957 [[Ford Thunderbird]] body with a 1961 [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] chassis to produce a sporty convertible. When Ford turned them down, Budd shifted focus to AMC. Ford went on to base the Mustang on the Falcon chassis.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nIn 1965, Budd designed and manufactured a front [[disc brake]] system for [[Chrysler]], [[Chrysler Imperial|Imperial]] and full-size [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] and [[Dodge]] automobiles, used (optionally) for the 1966\u201368 model years.\n\n==Divisions and subsidiaries==\nBy the end of 1950s, Budd had the following divisions and subsidiaries, important suppliers of the U.S. aerospace and military industry:<ref name=\"AW-19591215\" />\n* '''Budd Lewyt Electronics, Inc.''' \u2014 special-purpose data processing systems; communications equipment; instrumentation; products for the environmental control of electronic equipment.\n* '''Tatnall Measuring Systems Division''' \u2014 physical testing equipment, metal film strain gages, standard and custom load cells, and a unique PhotoStress technique for direct strain measurements.\n* '''Continental-Diamond Fibre Corporation''' \u2014 special high-heat resistant materials for ablation applications, laminated and molded plastics, vulcanized fibre, and bonded mica in the form of sheets, rods, tubes and tapes.\n* '''Defense Division''' \u2014 advanced aerospace and atomics structures, coupling a broad research and engineering capability with extensive prototype and production facilities.\n* '''Nuclear Systems Division''' \u2014 gamma radiography equipment for non-destructive testing of airframes, providing beam, panoramic and internal exposures in shop and field.\n* '''Electronic Controls Section''' \u2014 monautronic resistance welding controls for the aircraft industry.\n\n==Final years of railcar production==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2016}}\n[[File:MTAM Millford-Mill-departing-train.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|A Budd-built [[Baltimore Metro Subway]] train]]\n[[File:Linha1SP.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|A Budd train built by Mafersa in [[S\u00e3o Paulo Metro]]]]\n\nBudd built two series of \"L\" cars for the [[Chicago Transit Authority]], the [[2200 series (CTA)|2200 series]] (1969&ndash;1970). and the [[2600 series (Chicago \"L\")|2600 series]] (1981&ndash;1987).

The Tate Springs Resort complex located in the Bean Station region of the county, provided accommodations for tourists and business travelers alike until the [[Great Depression]]. It included mineral baths and waters, an enormous resort hotel, a swimming pool and bathhouse, a springhouse constructed as a gazebo, private cabins, and a golf course. After the Great Depression, the resort had closed and the property was given to local authorities. A children\u2019s home and school occupied the space of the hotel and cabins, until a major fire destroyed the entire hotel in the 1960s.

The Shields family operated Holston Paper Mill, one of the earliest local industries in the county.

He is the [[patron saint]] for persons suffering from [[cancer]], AIDS, or other illness.\n\n==Life==\nPeregrine Laziosi was born in 1260, the only son of an affluent family in [[Forl\u00ec]], in northern [[Italy]]. At that time Forli was part of the Papal States. Peregrine's family supported the anti-papal faction. In 1283 the residents of Forl\u00ec were under interdict.<ref name=servite>[http://stperegrine.org/biography/ Biography of St. Peregrine, The Order of Friar Servants of Mary]</ref> St. [[Philip Benizi]], Prior General of the Friar Servants of Saint Mary, was sent to try to reconcile the divided community. While trying to preach in Forl\u00ec, Philip was heckled and struck by the eighteen-year-old Peregrine. He was driven from the city with insults and violence. Peregrine repented and asked Philip for forgiveness. St. Philip received him with kindness. The moment had a profound effect on Peregrine. Filled with remorse, he began to pray more and to channel his energies into good works. A few years later, he joined the Servites in Siena and went on to be ordained a priest.<ref name=foley>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1373 Foley OFM, Leonard.

It is said that he miraculously multiplied grain and wine during a severe shortage in his area.<ref name=servite/> People took to calling him the \"Angel of Good Counsel\", so grateful were they for his wise advice so freely given.<ref name=fma>[http://www.franciscanmissionassoc.org/requests_stperegrine_story.cfm \"The Story of St. Peregrine\", Franciscan Mission Associates]</ref>\n\nOne of the special penances he imposed on himself was to stand whenever it was not necessary to sit. When tired he would support himself on a choir stall. At the age of sixty, he developed an infection in his right leg.<ref name=benburb>[http://www.servites-benburb.com/st_peregrine.php \"St. Peregrine OSM\", Our Lady of Benburb Priory]</ref> His condition deteriorated to the point that the physician decided to amputate his leg.<ref name=foley/>\n\nThe night before the operation Peregrine spent time praying before a fresco of the Crucifixion in the chapter room. He fell into a deep trance-like sleep and seemed to see Jesus descend from the cross to touch his leg.<ref name=foley/>\n\nThe following day, the doctor arrived to perform the amputation and finding no sign of the cancer, news spread of the miraculous cure throughout the town. This only increased the people\u2019s regard for Peregrine.  The saint died of a fever on May 1, 1345 at the age of eighty-five.  An extraordinary number of people from the town and countryside honored his death.  Some of the sick who came were healed through his intercession.<ref name=servite/>\n\n==Veneration==\nHis body rests in the Servite church of Forl\u00ec, the Basilica of Saint Pellegrino Laziosi.<ref>[http://www.basilicasanpellegrinolaziosi.it/old/santo_en.php Basilica of Saint Pellegrino Laziosi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417182044/http://www.basilicasanpellegrinolaziosi.it/old/santo_en.php |date=April 17, 2012 }}</ref> Pope Paul V declared him blessed in 1609 and Pope Benedict XIII canonized him in 1726.<ref name=servite/> The liturgical feast of Saint Pellegrino/Peregrine is on May 1.\n\nPeregrine is considered the [[patron saint]] of those suffering from [[cancer]].

It houses a relic taken from St. Peregrine himself, a rib. It is currently on display in the church's Relic Chapel. There is a Saint Peregrine Cancer Shrine with Perpetual Eucharistic Adoration at Christ the King Catholic Church in Mesa, Arizona. The mission of this St. Peregrine Shrine is to promote perpetual adoration of Jesus Christ and to pray for those affected by cancer. In the midst of suffering, a sanctuary for spiritual healing and emotional peace is offered. <ref>{{Cite web | url=http://cancershrine.com/about-us/mission-statement/ | title=Mission Statement}}</ref>\nThere also is a statue of St. Peregrine in the Mission church of San Juan Capistrano in southern California.\n\n==Legacy==\nAccording to some, the lesson of Peregrine's life is not that God worked a miracle, but that a faithful servant placed himself, unconditionally, in the hands of God.

He is the [[patron saint]] for persons suffering from [[cancer]], AIDS, or other illness.\n\n==Life==\nPeregrine Laziosi was born in 1260, the only son of an affluent family in [[Forl\u00ec]], in northern [[Italy]]. At that time Forli was part of the Papal States. Peregrine's family supported the anti-papal faction. In 1283 the residents of Forl\u00ec were under interdict.<ref name=servite>[http://stperegrine.org/biography/ Biography of St. Peregrine, The Order of Friar Servants of Mary]</ref> St. [[Philip Benizi]], Prior General of the Friar Servants of Saint Mary, was sent to try to reconcile the divided community. While trying to preach in Forl\u00ec, Philip was heckled and struck by the eighteen-year-old Peregrine. He was driven from the city with insults and violence. Peregrine repented and asked Philip for forgiveness. St. Philip received him with kindness. The moment had a profound effect on Peregrine. Filled with remorse, he began to pray more and to channel his energies into good works. A few years later, he joined the Servites in Siena and went on to be ordained a priest.<ref name=foley>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1373 Foley OFM, Leonard.

It is said that he miraculously multiplied grain and wine during a severe shortage in his area.<ref name=servite/> People took to calling him the \"Angel of Good Counsel\", so grateful were they for his wise advice so freely given.<ref name=fma>[http://www.franciscanmissionassoc.org/requests_stperegrine_story.cfm \"The Story of St. Peregrine\", Franciscan Mission Associates]</ref>\n\nOne of the special penances he imposed on himself was to stand whenever it was not necessary to sit. When tired he would support himself on a choir stall. At the age of sixty, he developed an infection in his right leg.<ref name=benburb>[http://www.servites-benburb.com/st_peregrine.php \"St. Peregrine OSM\", Our Lady of Benburb Priory]</ref> His condition deteriorated to the point that the physician decided to amputate his leg.<ref name=foley/>\n\nThe night before the operation Peregrine spent time praying before a fresco of the Crucifixion in the chapter room. He fell into a deep trance-like sleep and seemed to see Jesus descend from the cross to touch his leg.<ref name=foley/>\n\nThe following day, the doctor arrived to perform the amputation and finding no sign of the cancer, news spread of the miraculous cure throughout the town. This only increased the people\u2019s regard for Peregrine.  The saint died of a fever on May 1, 1345 at the age of eighty-five.  An extraordinary number of people from the town and countryside honored his death.  Some of the sick who came were healed through his intercession.<ref name=servite/>\n\n==Veneration==\nHis body rests in the Servite church of Forl\u00ec, the Basilica of Saint Pellegrino Laziosi.<ref>[http://www.basilicasanpellegrinolaziosi.it/old/santo_en.php Basilica of Saint Pellegrino Laziosi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417182044/http://www.basilicasanpellegrinolaziosi.it/old/santo_en.php |date=April 17, 2012 }}</ref> Pope Paul V declared him blessed in 1609 and Pope Benedict XIII canonized him in 1726.<ref name=servite/> The liturgical feast of Saint Pellegrino/Peregrine is on May 1.\n\nPeregrine is considered the [[patron saint]] of those suffering from [[cancer]]. The National Shrine of Saint Peregrine is located at [[Our Lady of Sorrows Basilica]] in Chicago, Illinois, as a ministry of the Friar Servants of Mary.<ref name=shrine>[http://stperegrine.org/national-shrine/ National Shrine of St. Peregrine, Friar Servants of Mary]</ref> There is a St. Peregrine Shrine at [[The Grotto]], at The National Sanctuary of Our Sorrowful Mother, in Portland, Oregon.

It houses a relic taken from St. Peregrine himself, a rib. It is currently on display in the church's Relic Chapel. There is a Saint Peregrine Cancer Shrine with Perpetual Eucharistic Adoration at Christ the King Catholic Church in Mesa, Arizona. The mission of this St. Peregrine Shrine is to promote perpetual adoration of Jesus Christ and to pray for those affected by cancer. In the midst of suffering, a sanctuary for spiritual healing and emotional peace is offered. <ref>{{Cite web | url=http://cancershrine.com/about-us/mission-statement/ | title=Mission Statement}}</ref>\nThere also is a statue of St. Peregrine in the Mission church of San Juan Capistrano in southern California.\n\n==Legacy==\nAccording to some, the lesson of Peregrine's life is not that God worked a miracle, but that a faithful servant placed himself, unconditionally, in the hands of God. Peregrine's trust in God therefore serves as a model for those dealing with sickness.<ref name=grotto/> However, his recovery has been cited as an example of the potency of the immune system in fighting cancer.<ref>[http://pmj.bmj.com/content/79/938/672 Cann SH, Van Netten JP, Van Netten C.

[[Kerbala]], against [[corruption]] and a national government that protestors saw as unaccountable for its actions. After the [[History of Iraq (2003\u20132011)|U.S. occupation (2003\u201311)]], oligarchs and warlords were perceived to have taken control over Iraq. While the country produces more oil than the [[United Arab Emirates]], the oil revenues were seen by protestors as failing to be spent on maintenance of hospitals and roads. A widely used slogan in this phase of the protests was: \"We want a home land\"\u2014reflecting a longing both for a sense of unity and for a self-determined life in dignity.<ref name=Zeit13Nov>{{in lang|de}} [https://www.zeit.de/2019/47/irak-proteste-iran-vorherrschaft-naher-osten 'Sie wollen B\u00fcrger sein' (They want to be citizens)].

The meeting expressed satisfaction that eight of the ministers under Abadi were sufficiently \"in complete harmony\", \"close\", in a \"special relationship\" or \"loyal to\" Iran, including Foreign Minister [[Ibrahim al-Jaafari]] and Minister of Transportation [[Baqir Jabr al-Zubeidi|Bayan Jabr Solagh]], and two were \"better than the previous [ones]\".

Friends of the victims and security services told ''[[Thomson Reuters]]'' that the assassination had been ordered by an Iran-backed militia. Interviews by ''Thomson Reuters'' with officials and activists indicated a \"pattern of mass arrests, intimidation and torture, and in some cases targeted killings of Iraqi protesters\", with six activists \"shot dead in or near their homes\" over the year from November 2018 to October 2019, that was attributed by the interviewees to an Iran-backed militia. The activists had criticised the militias and been threatened for their activism. In November, gunmen in unmarked cars killed activist Adnan Rustum in Baghdad and another activist in Amara.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nAn Iranian official contacted by ''Thomson Reuters'' said the claims of assassinations and threats by Iran-backed militias were \"baseless\".{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Iraqi Prime Minister stated during a parliament meeting, \u201cHuge demonstrations against me duly materialized and Trump called again to threaten that if I did not comply with his demands, then he would have Marine snipers on tall buildings target protesters and security personnel alike in order to pressure me. I refused again and handed in my resignation.
