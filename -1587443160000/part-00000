During the [[Second Party System]] (from 1832 to the mid-1850s) under [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[James K. Polk]], the Democrats usually bested the opposition [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] by narrow margins.\n\nFrom 1860 to 1932 in the era of the [[American Civil War]] to the [[Great Depression]], the opposing [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], organized in the mid-1850s from the ruins of the Whig Party and some other smaller splinter groups, was dominant in [[United States presidential election|presidential politics]]. The Democrats elected [[List of United States Presidents|only two Presidents]] during this period: [[Grover Cleveland]] (in 1884 and 1892) and [[Woodrow Wilson]] (in 1912 and 1916). Over the same period, the Democrats proved more competitive with the Republicans in [[United States midterm election|Congressional politics]], enjoying [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] majorities (as in the [[65th United States Congress|65th Congress]]) in 15 of the 36 [[United States Congress|Congresses]] elected, although only in five of these did they form the majority in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Furthermore, the Democratic Party was split between the [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, representing Eastern business interests; and the agrarian elements comprising poor farmers in the South and West. The agrarian element, marching behind the slogan of [[free silver]] (i.e. in favor of inflation), captured the party in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the 1896, 1900 and 1908 presidential elections, although he lost every time. Both Bryan and Wilson were leaders of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] (1890s\u20131920s).\n\n[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Andrew Jackson]], founder of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the first [[President of the United States|President]] to be elected from the Democratic Party (1829\u20131837)]]\nStarting with 32nd President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1932 during the Great Depression, the party dominated the [[Fifth Party System]], with its [[Social liberalism|progressive liberal]] policies and programs with the [[New Deal coalition]] to combat the emergency bank closings and the continuing financial depression since the famous [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and later going into the crises leading up to [[World War II]]. The Democrats and the Democratic Party finally lost the [[White House]] and control of the executive branch of government only after Roosevelt's death in April 1945 near the end of the war and after the continuing post-war administration of Roosevelt's third [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], former [[United States Senator|Senator]] from Missouri (for 1945 to 1953, elections of [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]] and the \"stunner\" of [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]]). A new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] President was only elected later in the following decade of the early 1950s with the losses by two-time nominee, the [[Governor of Illinois]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] (grandson of the [[Adlai Stevenson I|former Vice President with the same name]] of the [[1892 United States presidential election|1890s]]) to the very popular war hero and commanding general in World War II, [[General of the Army (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]]).\n\nWith two brief interruptions since the Great Depression and World War II eras, the Democrats with unusually large majorities for over four decades, controlled the lower house of the Congress in the House of Representatives from 1930 until 1994 and the Senate for most of that same period, electing the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and the Representatives' majority leaders/committee chairs along with the upper house of the Senate's majority leaders and committee chairmen. Important Democratic progressive/liberal leaders included 33rd and 36th Presidents Harry S. Truman of [[Missouri]] (1945\u20131953) and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of [[Texas]] (1963\u20131969), respectively; and the earlier [[Kennedy family|Kennedy brothers]] of 35th President [[John F. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]] (1961\u20131963), Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] of [[New York State|New York]] and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts who carried the flag for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. Since the [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1976]], Democrats have won five out of the last eleven presidential elections, winning in the presidential elections of [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] (with 39th President [[Jimmy Carter]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1977\u20131981), [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] (with 42nd President [[Bill Clinton]] of [[Arkansas]], 1993\u20132001) and [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] (with 44th President [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]], 2009\u20132017). Democrats have also won the [[Plurality voting|popular vote]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], but lost the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] with [[Al Gore]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], respectively.

Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue that \"the Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s\".<ref>{{cite book|first1=Theodore|last1=Caplow|first2=Howard M.|last2=Bahr|first3=Bruce A.|last3=Chadwick|first4=John|last4=Modell|title=Recent Social Trends in the United States, 1960\u20131990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwBvm8aF2bsC&pg=PA337|year=1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=337|isbn=9780773512122}} They add: \"The Republican party, nationally, moved from right-center toward the center in 1940s and 1950s, then moved right again in the 1970s and 1980s.</ref>\n\n== Foundation: 1820-28 ==\nThe modern Democratic Party emerged in the late 1820s from former factions of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which had largely collapsed by 1824. It was built by [[Martin Van Buren]], who assembled a cadre of politicians in every state behind war hero [[Andrew Jackson]] of Tennessee.<ref>Robert V. Remini, ''Martin Van Buren and the Making of the Democratic Party'' (1959).</ref>\n\n==Jacksonian ascendancy: 1829-40==\n\n=== Presidency of Andrew Jackson (1829\u20131837) ===\n\n{{main|Jacksonian democracy}}\n[[File:The modern balaam and his ass.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|1837 cartoon shows the Democratic Party as donkey]]\n\nThe spirit of [[Jacksonian democracy]] animated the party from the early 1830s to the 1850s, shaping the [[Second Party System]], with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] as the main opposition. After the disappearance of the [[Federalist party|Federalists]] after 1815 and the [[Era of Good Feelings]] (1816\u20131824), there was a hiatus of weakly organized personal factions until about 1828\u20131832, when the modern Democratic Party emerged along with its rival, the Whigs. The new Democratic Party became a coalition of farmers, city-dwelling laborers and Irish Catholics.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005)</ref> Both parties worked hard to build [[grassroots]] organizations and maximize the turnout of voters, which often reached 80 percent or 90 percent of eligible voters. Both parties used [[Patronage#Politics|patronage]] extensively to finance their operations, which included emerging big city [[political machine]]s as well as national networks of newspapers.<ref>Michael Kazin, ed., ''The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (2011) pp 59-65, 159-62, 600-603.</ref>\n\nBehind the party platforms, acceptance speeches of candidates, editorials, pamphlets and stump speeches, there was a widespread consensus of political values among Democrats. As Mary Beth Norton explains: <blockquote>The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] concept of an [[agrarian society]]. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"[[Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]]\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. [...] Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual \u2013 the artisan and the ordinary farmer \u2013 by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of [[Banknote|paper currency]], which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like [[Education reform|educational reform]] and the establishment of a public education system....Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], initiating the removal of the [[Cherokee]]s along the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p. 287</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe party was weakest in [[New England]], but strong everywhere else and won most national elections thanks to strength in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] (by far the most populous states at the time) and the [[American frontier]]. Democrats opposed elites and aristocrats, the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] and the whiggish modernizing programs that would build up industry at the expense of the [[yeoman]] or independent small farmer.<ref>John Ashworth, ''\"Agrarians\" & \"Aristocrats\": Party Political Ideology in the United States, 1837\u20131846'' (1983).</ref>\n\nThe party was known for its populism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://utpress.org/title/andrew-jackson-and-the-rise-of-the-democratic-party/|title=Andrew Jackson and the Rise of the Democratic Party - University of Tennessee Press|publisher=}}</ref> Historian Frank Towers has specified an important ideological divide: <blockquote>Democrats stood for the 'sovereignty of the people' as expressed in popular demonstrations, constitutional conventions, and majority rule as a general principle of governing, whereas Whigs advocated the rule of law, written and unchanging constitutions, and protections for minority interests against majority tyranny.<ref>Frank Towers, \"Mobtown's Impact on the Study of Urban Politics in the Early Republic.\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 107 (Winter 2012) pp. 469\u201375, p. 472, citing Robert E, Shalhope, ''The Baltimore Bank Riot: Political Upheaval in Antebellum Maryland'' (2009) p. 147.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt its inception, the Democratic Party was the party of the \"common man\".<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2013/04/10/wait-whose-plantation-now/|title=Wait, Whose Plantation Now? - The Edge of the American West|first=David|last=Silbey|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}</ref> It opposed the abolition of slavery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/12/8/7328755/maps-democratic-party|title=23 maps that explain how Democrats went from the party of racism to the party of Obama|first=Andrew|last=Prokop|date=8 December 2014|website=Vox}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nFrom 1828 to 1848, banking and tariffs were the central domestic policy issues. Democrats strongly favored\u2014and Whigs opposed\u2014expansion to new farm lands, as typified by their expulsion of eastern [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and acquisition of vast amounts of new land in the West after 1846. The party favored the [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with Mexico]] and opposed anti-immigrant [[nativism (politics)|nativism]]. In the 1830s, the [[Locofocos]] in New York City were radically democratic, anti-monopoly and were proponents of [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]] and [[free trade]].<ref>Earle (2004), p. 19</ref><ref>Taylor (2006), p. 54</ref> Their chief spokesman was [[William Leggett (USA)|William Leggett]]. At this time, [[labor union]]s were few and some were loosely affiliated with the party.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''Chants Democratic: New York City and the Rise of the American Working Class, 1788\u20131850'' (1984)</ref>\n\n=== Presidency of Martin Van Buren (1837\u20131841) ===\n[[Martin Van Buren]] was key in the development of the Democratic Party, although his presidency featured many setbacks. Many of the policies of Jackson had repercussions while Van Buren held office, such as the [[Trail of Tears]]. The policies enacted during Jackson came into full swing during Van Buren, who oversaw the displacement of thousands of Native Americans. In addition to this, Van Buren was anti-slavery and represented a divide in both parties. Despite this, he did almost nothing to help the abolitionist movement and his presidency saw a continuation of pro-slavery legislation. Jackson's decision to abolish the [[Second Bank of the United States]] led to the [[Panic of 1837]] during Van Buren's presidency, leading to disapproval by the public and loss of power for his party.\n\nThe 1840 Democratic convention was the first at which the party adopted a platform. Delegates reaffirmed their belief that the Constitution was the primary guide for each state's political affairs. To them, this meant that all roles of the federal government not specifically defined fell to each respective state government, including such responsibilities as debt created by local projects. Decentralized power and states' rights pervaded each and every resolution adopted at the convention, including those on slavery, taxes, and the possibility of a central bank.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/polcon/democraticindex.html |title= 1840 Democratic Convention |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030799376 |title=Proceedings of the National democratic convention, held in ...

The Whigs nominated [[William Henry Harrison]] as their candidate for the 1840 presidential race. Harrison won as the first President of the Whigs. However, he died in office a month later and was succeeded by his Vice President [[John Tyler]]. Tyler had recently left the Democrats for the Whigs and thus his beliefs did not align much with the Whig Party. During his presidency, he vetoed many of his own party's bills, leading to his own party disowning him. This allowed for the Democrats to retake power in 1845.\n\n== Presidency of James K. Polk (1845\u20131849) ==\nForeign policy was a major issue in the 1840s as war threatened with Mexico over Texas and with Britain over Oregon. Democrats strongly supported [[Manifest Destiny]] and most Whigs strongly opposed it. The [[1844 United States presidential election|1844 election]] was a showdown, with the Democrat [[James K. Polk]] narrowly defeating Whig [[Henry Clay]] on the Texas issue.<ref>Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America 1815\u20131848'' (2007) pp. 705\u2013706.</ref>\n\n[[John Mack Faragher]]'s analysis of the political polarization between the parties is: <blockquote>Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the [[Northern United States|North]]) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by [[Technological and industrial history of the United States|industrialization]] but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|territories]]. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed. [...] For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.<ref>John Mack Faragher et al. ''Out of Many: A History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 1997) p. 413</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Free Soil split===\nIn [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]] a major innovation was the creation of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) to coordinate state activities in the presidential contest. Senator [[Lewis Cass]], who held many offices over the years, lost to General [[Zachary Taylor]] of the Whigs. A major cause of the defeat was that the new [[Free Soil Party]], which opposed slavery expansion, split the Democratic vote, particularly in New York, where the electoral votes went to Taylor.<ref>Frederick J. Blue, ''The Free Soilers: Third Party Politics, 1848-54'' (1973).</ref> The Free Soil Party attracted Democrats, and some Whigs, and had considerable support in the Northeast. The primary doctrine was a warning that rich slave owners would move into new territories such as Nebraska and buy up the best lands, and work them with slaves. To protect the white farmer it was essential therefore to keep the soil \"free\"\u2014that is without slavery. The fate of the slaves was not of concern. In 1852, the free soil movement was much smaller, and consisted primarily of former members of the Liberty Party and some abolitionists, it hedged on the question of full equality. The majority wanted some form of racial separation to allow space for black activism, without alienating the overwhelming northern opposition to equal rights for black men.<ref>Eric  Foner,  \"Politics and Prejudice: The Free Soil Party and the Negro, 1849-1852.\" ''Journal of Negro History'' 50.4 (1965): 239-256. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716247 online]</ref>\n\n== Presidencies of Zachary Taylor (1849\u20131850) and Millard Fillmore (1850\u20131853) ==\nFollowing the death of President Taylor, Democrats in Congress passed the [[Compromise of 1850]] designed to avoid civil war by putting the slavery issue to rest while resolves issued involving territories gained following the War with Mexico. However, in state after state the Democrats gained small but permanent advantages over the Whig Party, which finally collapsed in 1852, fatally weakened by division on slavery and [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]]. The fragmented opposition could not stop the election of Democrats [[Franklin Pierce]] in [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] and [[James Buchanan]] in [[1856 United States presidential election|1856]].<ref>Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005) ch. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\n== The presidencies of Franklin Pierce (1853\u201357) and James Buchanan (1857\u201361) ==\n[[file:Augustbelmont.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|August Belmont: DNC Chair for 12 years during and after the Civil war]]\n\nThe eight years during which Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan held the presidency were disasters; historians agree that they rank as among the worst presidents. The Party increasingly split along regional lines. In 1860 two Democrats ran for president and the United States was moving rapidly toward civil war.<ref>David M. Potter, ''The Impending Crisis, 1848\u20131861'' (1976) pp 225-67.</ref>\n\n=== Young America ===\nYonatan Eyal (2007) argues that the 1840s and 1850s were the heyday of a new faction of young Democrats called \"[[Young America movement|Young America]]\". Led by [[Stephen A. Douglas]], James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce and New York financier [[August Belmont]], this faction explains, broke with the agrarian and [[Strict constructionism|strict constructionist]] orthodoxies of the past and embraced commerce, technology, regulation, reform and internationalism. The movement attracted a circle of outstanding writers, including [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[George Bancroft]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]. They sought independence from European standards of [[high culture]] and wanted to demonstrate the excellence and [[exceptionalism]] of [[American literature|America's own literary tradition]].<ref>Yonatan Eyal, ''The Young America Movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, 1828\u20131861'', (2007)</ref>\n\nIn economic policy, Young America saw the necessity of a modern infrastructure with railroads, canals, telegraphs, turnpikes and harbors. They endorsed the \"[[market revolution]]\" and promoted [[capitalism]]. They called for Congressional land grants to the states, which allowed Democrats to claim that [[internal improvements]] were locally rather than federally sponsored. Young America claimed that modernization would perpetuate the agrarian vision of [[Jeffersonian democracy]] by allowing yeomen farmers to sell their products and therefore to prosper. They tied internal improvements to [[free trade]], while accepted moderate tariffs as a necessary source of government revenue. They supported the [[Independent Treasury]] (the Jacksonian alternative to the Second Bank of the United States) not as a scheme to quash the special privilege of the Whiggish monied elite, but as a device to spread prosperity to all [[Americans]].<ref>Eyal, ''The Young America Movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, 1828\u20131861,'' p. 79</ref>\n\n=== Breakdown of the Second Party System (1854\u20131859) ===\nSectional confrontations escalated during the 1850s, the Democratic Party split between [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]] grew deeper. The conflict was papered over at the [[1852 Democratic National Convention|1852]] and [[1856 Democratic National Convention|1856 conventions]] by selecting men who had little involvement in sectionalism, but they made matters worse. Historian [[Roy F. Nichols]] explains why [[Franklin Pierce]] was not up to the challenges a Democratic president had to face:\n:As a national political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]] on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence.

The demands were to support slavery outside the South. Southerners insisted that full equality for their region required the government to acknowledge the legitimacy of slavery outside the South. The Southern demands included a fugitive slave law to recapture runaway slaves; opening Kansas to slavery; forcing a pro-slavery constitution on Kansas; acquire Cuba (where slavery already existed); accepting the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court; and adopting a federal slave code to protect slavery in the territories. President Buchanan went along with these demands, but Douglas refused and proved a much better politician than Buchanan, though the bitter battle lasted for years and permanently alienated the Northern and Southern wings.<ref>Michael Todd Landis. ''Northern Men with Southern Loyalties: The Democratic Party and the Sectional Crisis'' (2014).</ref>\n\nWhen the new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] formed in 1854 on the basis of refusing to tolerate the expansion of slavery into the territories, many northern Democrats (especially [[Free Soil Party|Free Soilers]] from 1848) joined it.

No party politics were allowed in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], whose political leadership, mindful of the welter prevalent in antebellum American politics and with a pressing need for unity, largely viewed political parties as inimical to good governance and as being especially unwise in wartime. Consequently, the Democratic Party halted all operations during the life of the Confederacy (1861\u20131865).<ref name=\"Jennifer L. Weber 2006\">Jennifer L. Weber, ''Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln's Opponents in the North'' (2006)</ref>\n\nPartisanship flourished in the North and strengthened the Lincoln Administration as Republicans automatically rallied behind it. After the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], Douglas rallied Northern Democrats behind the Union, but when Douglas died the party lacked an outstanding figure in the North and by 1862 an anti-war peace element was gaining strength. The most intense anti-war elements were the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]].<ref name=\"Jennifer L.

To a considerable extent, the challenge of restoring morale was the province of historian [[Claude Bowers]]. His histories of the Democratic Party in its formative years from the 1790s to the 1830s helped shape the party's self-image as a powerful force against monopoly and privilege. In his enormously popular books ''Party Battles of the Jackson Period'' (1922) and ''Jefferson and Hamilton: The Struggle for Democracy in America'' (1925) he argued for the political and moral superiority of the Democratic Party since the days of Jefferson versus the almost un-American faults of the [[Federalist Party]], the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], as bastions of aristocracy. ''Jefferson and Hamilton'' especially impressed his friend [[Franklin D Roosevelt]]. It inspired Roosevelt when he became president to build a great monument to the party's founder in the national capital, the [[Jefferson Memorial]]. According to Historian [[Merrill D. Peterson]], the book conveyed:\n<blockquote>the myth of the Democratic Party masterfully re-created, a fresh awareness of the elemental differences between the parties, and ideology with which they might make sense of the two often senseless conflicts of the present, and a feeling for the importance of dynamic leadership. The book was a mirror for Democrats.<ref>{{cite book|first=Merrill D.|last=Peterson|title=The Jefferson Image in the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QNrZoAgGAsC&pg=PA351|year=1960|page=351|isbn=9780813918518}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== The Great Depression and a Second World War: Democratic hegemony (1930\u201353) ==\nThe Great Depression marred Hoover's term as the Democratic Party made large gains in the 1930 congressional elections and garnered a landslide win in 1932.\n\n=== Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933\u20131945) ===\n[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the longest-serving President of the United States (1933\u20131945)]]\nThe [[Wall Street Crash 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]] set the stage for a more progressive government and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] won a [[landslide victory]] in the [[1932 United States presidential election|election of 1932]], campaigning on a platform of \"Relief, Recovery, and Reform\", that is relief of unemployment and rural distress, recovery of the economy back to normal and long-term structural reforms to prevent a repetition of the Depression. This came to be termed \"[[New Deal|The New Deal]]\" after a phrase in Roosevelt's acceptance speech.<ref>Robert T. Oliver, \"The speech that established Roosevelt's reputation.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech '' 31#3   (1945): 274-282.</ref>\n\nThe Democrats also swept to large majorities in both houses of Congress and among state governors. Roosevelt altered the nature of the party, away from ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and towards an ideology of economic regulation and insurance against hardship. Two old words took on new meanings: \"liberal\" now meant a supporter of the New Deal while \"conservative\" meant an opponent.<ref>[[Pamela Johnston Conover]], and Stanley Feldman, \"The origins and meaning of liberal/conservative self-identifications.\" ''American Journal of Political Science'' 25#4 (1981), pp. 617-645 617-645.</ref>\n\n[[Conservative Democrat]]s were outraged and led by [[Al Smith]] they formed the [[American Liberty League]] in 1934 and counterattacked. They failed and either retired from politics or joined the Republican Party. A few of them, such as [[Dean Acheson]], found their way back to the Democratic Party.<ref>Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1958) pp 227-46.</ref>\n\nThe 1933 programs, called \"the First New Deal\" by historians, represented a broad consensus. Roosevelt tried to reach out to business and labor, farmers and consumers, cities and countryside. However, by 1934 he was moving toward a more confrontational policy. After making gains in state governorships and in Congress, in 1934 Roosevelt embarked on an ambitious legislative program that came to be called \"The [[Second New Deal]]\". It was characterized by building up labor unions, nationalizing welfare by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], setting up [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], imposing more regulations on business (especially transportation and communications) and raising taxes on business profits.<ref>James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox: Vol. 1, 1882-1940'' (1958) pp 171-208.</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's New Deal programs focused on job creation through [[public works]] projects as well as on social welfare programs such as Social Security. It also included sweeping reforms to the banking system, work regulation, transportation, communications and stock markets, as well as attempts to regulate prices. His policies soon paid off by uniting a diverse coalition of Democratic voters called the [[New Deal coalition]], which included labor unions, Southerners, minorities (most significantly, Catholics and Jews) and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]]. This united voter base allowed Democrats to be elected to Congress and the presidency for much of the next 30 years.<ref>Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1958) pp 264-90.</ref>\n\n===The Second term===\nAfter a triumphant re-election in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]], he announced plans to [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|enlarge the Supreme Court]], which tended to oppose his New Deal, by five new members. A firestorm of opposition erupted, led by his own Vice President [[John Nance Garner]]. Roosevelt was defeated by an alliance of Republicans and conservative Democrats, who formed a [[conservative coalition]] that managed to block nearly all liberal legislation (only a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage law]] got through). Annoyed by the conservative wing of his own party, Roosevelt made an attempt to rid himself of it and in 1938 he actively campaigned against five incumbent conservative Democratic senators, though all five senators won re-election.<ref>Milton Plesur,  \"The Republican congressional comeback of 1938.\" ''Review of Politics'' 24.4 (1962): 525-562.</ref>\n\n===The Party===\nUnder Roosevelt, the Democratic Party became identified more closely with modern liberalism, which included the promotion of [[social welfare]], [[labor unions]], [[civil rights]] and the regulation of business, as well as support for farmers and promotion of ethnic leaders. The opponents, who stressed long-term growth and support for entrepreneurship and low taxes, now started calling themselves \"conservatives\".<ref>Sean J. Savage, ''Roosevelt: The Party Leader, 1932-1945'' (2015).</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nWith a near disaster in 1937 with the so-called \"recession\" and the near defeat in Congress in 1938, things looked bleak for the Democrats, but FDR decided that he with the upcoming crisis that would become World War II, he was irreplaceable, and he broke tradition and ran for a third, and later 4th term, taking a Democratic congress with him.\n\n=== Presidency of Harry S. Truman (1945\u20131953) ===\n[[Harry S. Truman]] took over after Roosevelt's death in 1945 and the rifts inside the party that Roosevelt had papered over began to emerge. Major components included the big city machines, the Southern state and local parties, the far-left and the \"Liberal coalition\" or \"Liberal-Labor coalition\" comprising the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]], [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] and ideological groups such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] (representing [[African American|Blacks]]), the [[American Jewish Congress]] (AJC) and the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) (representing liberal intellectuals).<ref>\nDaniel Disalvo. \"The Politics of a Party Faction: The Liberal-Labor Alliance in the Democratic Party, 1948\u20131972,\" ''Journal of Policy History'' (2010) vol.  22#3 pp. 269\u201399 in [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_policy_history/v022/22.3.disalvo.html Project MUSE]</ref> By 1948, the unions had expelled nearly all the far-left and communist elements.<ref>Max M.

Eisenhower]] rejected their invitation they lacked an alternative. Truman counterattacked, pushing [[J.

However, all of Truman's [[Fair Deal]] proposals, such as [[universal health care]], were defeated by the Southern Democrats in Congress. His seizure of the steel industry was [[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer|reversed by the Supreme Court]].<ref>Sean J. Savage, ''Truman and the Democratic Party'' (2015).</ref>\n\n==== Foreign policy ====\nOn the far-left, former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] denounced Truman as a war-monger for his anti-Soviet programs, the [[Truman Doctrine]], [[Marshall Plan]] and [[NATO]]. Wallace quit the party and ran for [[1948 United States presidential election|President as an independent in 1948]]. He called for [[d\u00e9tente]] with the [[Soviet Union\u2013United States relations|Soviet Union]], but much of his campaign was controlled by communists who had been expelled from the main unions. Wallace fared poorly and helped turn the anti-communist vote toward Truman.<ref>Robert A.

Wallace supporters and other Democrats who were farther left were pushed out of the party and the CIO in 1946\u20131948 by young anti-communists like [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Walter Reuther]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] [[Hollywood]] emerged in the 1940s as an important new base in the party and was led by movie-star politicians such as [[Ronald Reagan]], who strongly supported Roosevelt and Truman at this time.<ref>{{cite book|first=Edward M.|last=Yager|title=Ronald Reagan's Journey: Democrat to Republican|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2cs7IHERBwC&pg=PA43|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=43|isbn=9780742544215}}</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, Europe was safe, but troubles mounted in Asia as China fell to the communists in 1949. Truman entered the [[Korean War]] without formal Congressional approval. When the war turned to a stalemate and he fired General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in 1951, Republicans blasted his policies in Asia. A series of petty scandals among friends and buddies of Truman further tarnished his image, allowing the Republicans in 1952 to crusade against \"Korea, Communism and Corruption\". Truman dropped out of the Presidential race early in 1952, leaving no obvious successor. The convention nominated [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], only to see him overwhelmed by two Eisenhower landslides.<ref>{{cite book|first=Kenneth F.|last=Warren|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Campaigns, Elections, and Electoral Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCh1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA634|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=634|isbn=9781452265872}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of Dwight D.

It also brought brief Republican control to both houses of Congress for one term. In Congress, the powerful team of Texans House Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] and Senate Majority leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] held the party together, often by compromising with Eisenhower. In 1958, the party made dramatic gains in the midterms and seemed to have a permanent lock on Congress, thanks largely to organized labor. Indeed, Democrats had majorities in the House every election from 1930 to 1992 (except 1946 and 1952).<ref>{{cite book|first1=Earl|last1=Black|first2=Merle|last2=Black|title=Divided America: The Ferocious Power Struggle in American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm8eHHDR_osC&pg=PT23|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=23 |isbn=9781416539056}}</ref>\n\nMost Southern Congressmen were [[conservative Democrats]] and they usually worked with conservative Republicans.<ref>James T.

He challenged America in the [[Space Race]] to land an American man on the moon by 1969. After the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] he moved to de-escalate tensions with the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>James N. Giglio, ''Presidency of John F. Kennedy'' (2006).</ref>\n\nKennedy also pushed for [[civil rights]] and [[racial integration]], one example being Kennedy assigning federal marshals to protect the [[Freedom Riders]] in the South. His election did mark the coming of age of the Catholic component of the New Deal Coalition. After 1964, middle class Catholics started voting Republican in the same proportion as their Protestant neighbors. Except for the Chicago of [[Richard J. Daley]], the last of the Democratic machines faded away. [[Assassination of John F.

Johnson signed into law the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The act was passed in both House and Senate by a Republican majority and support from Democrats in Northern and Western states. Many Democrats and Republicans from the South opposed the act. The year 1968 marked a major crisis for the party. In January, even though it was a military defeat for the [[Viet Cong]], the [[Tet Offensive]] began to turn American public opinion against the Vietnam War. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] rallied intellectuals and [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] students on college campuses and came within a few percentage points of defeating Johnson in the [[New Hampshire primary]]:Johnson was permanently weakened.

Kennedy won the critical California primary on June 4, but [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|he was assassinated]] that night.

Meanwhile, Alabama's Democratic governor [[George C. Wallace]] launched a third-party campaign and at one point was running second to the Republican candidate Richard Nixon. Nixon barely won, with the Democrats retaining control of Congress. The party was now so deeply split that it would not again win a majority of the popular vote for president until [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], when Jimmy Carter won the popular vote in 1976 with 50.1%.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael C.|last=LeMay|title=The American Political Party System: A Reference Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fkmDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|year=2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=37\u201338}}</ref>\n\nThe degree to which the Southern Democrats had abandoned the party became evident in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]] when the electoral votes of every former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] state except [[Texas]] went to either Republican Richard Nixon or independent Wallace.

They did not continue to vote Republican in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] or [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], so the term fell into disuse except as a reference to the 1980s. The term is not used to describe [[White Southerners]] who became permanent Republicans in presidential elections.<ref name=\"Stanley B. Greenberg 1996\">Stanley B.

The county voted 63 percent for Kennedy in 1960 and 66 percent for Reagan in 1984. He concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead saw it as a party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially African Americans, [[advocacy group]]s of the [[political left]] and the very poor.<ref name=\"Stanley B. Greenberg 1996\"/>\n\nThe failure to hold the Reagan Democrats and the white South led to the final collapse of the New Deal coalition. In [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], Reagan carried 49 states against former Vice President and Minnesota Senator [[Walter Mondale]], a New Deal stalwart.<ref>Steven M. Gillon, ''The Democrats' Dilemma: Walter F. Mondale and the Liberal Legacy'' (1992) pp. 365\u201390</ref>\n\nIn response to these landslide defeats, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC) was created in 1985. It worked to move the party rightwards to the ideological center in order to recover some of the fundraising that had been lost to the Republicans due to corporate donors supporting Reagan. The goal was to retain left-of-center voters as well as moderates and conservatives on social issues to become a [[Big tent|catch all party]] with widespread appeal to most opponents of the Republicans. Despite this, Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], running not as a New Dealer but as an efficiency expert in public administration, lost by a landslide in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] to Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>Jack W. Germond and Jules Witcover. ''Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?'' (1989)</ref>\n\n=== South becomes Republican ===\nFor nearly a century after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the white South identified with the Democratic Party. The Democrats' lock on power was so strong the region was called the [[Solid South]], although the Republicans controlled parts of the [[Appalachian mountains]] and they competed for statewide office in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]. Before 1948, [[Southern Democrats]] believed that their party, with its respect for [[states' rights]] and appreciation of traditional southern values, was the defender of the Southern way of life. Southern Democrats warned against aggressive designs on the part of Northern liberals and Republicans and civil rights activists whom they denounced as \"outside agitators\".<ref>Joseph A. Aistrup, ''The southern strategy revisited: Republican top-down advancement in the South'' (2015).</ref>\n\nThe adoption of the strong civil rights plank by the 1948 convention and the integration of the armed forces by President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Executive Order 9981]], which provided for equal treatment and opportunity for African-American servicemen, drove a wedge between the Northern and Southern branches of the party. The party was sharply divided in the [[1948 United States presidential election|following election]], as [[Southern Democrats]] [[Strom Thurmond]] ran as \"States' Rights Democratic Party\".\n\nWith the presidency of John F. Kennedy the Democratic Party began to embrace the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and its lock on the South was irretrievably broken. Upon signing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], President Lyndon B. Johnson prophesied: \"We have lost the South for a generation\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Risen|first=Clay|title=How the South was won|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=March 5, 2006|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/03/05/how_the_south_was_won/|accessdate=November 24, 2006}}</ref>\n\nModernization had brought factories, national businesses and larger, more cosmopolitan cities such as [[Atlanta]], [[Dallas]], [[Charlotte]] and [[Houston]] to the South, as well as millions of migrants from the North and more opportunities for higher education. Meanwhile, the cotton and tobacco economy of the traditional rural South faded away, as former farmers commuted to factory jobs. As the South became more like the rest of the nation, it could not stand apart in terms of racial segregation. Integration and the Civil Rights Movement caused enormous controversy in the white South, with many attacking it as a violation of states' rights. When segregation was outlawed by court order and by the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, a die-hard element resisted integration, led by Democratic governors [[Orval Faubus]] of Arkansas, [[Lester Maddox]] of Georgia and especially [[George Wallace]] of Alabama. These populist governors appealed to a less-educated, blue-collar electorate that on economic grounds favored the Democratic Party and opposed desegregation. After 1965, most Southerners accepted integration (with the exception of public schools).<ref>Jon P, Alston, and Ben M. Crouch. \"White acceptance of three degrees of school desegregation, 1974.\" ''Phylon'' 39.3 (1978): 216-224.</ref>\n\nBelieving themselves betrayed by the Democratic Party, traditional [[White Southerners]] joined the new middle-class and the Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party. Meanwhile, newly enfranchised black voters began supporting Democratic candidates at the 80\u201390 percent levels, producing Democratic leaders such as [[Julian Bond]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of Georgia and [[Barbara Jordan]] of Texas. Just as [[Martin Luther King]] had promised, integration had brought about a new day in Southern politics.<ref>Katherine Tate, ''Black faces in the mirror: African Americans and their representatives in the US Congress'' (2018).</ref>\n \nIn addition to its white middle-class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities among [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]], who prior to the 1980s were largely apolitical. Exit polls in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]] showed that [[George W. Bush]] led [[John Kerry]] by 70\u201330% among White Southerners, who were 71% of the voters. Kerry had a 90\u20139 lead among the 18% of Southern voters who were black. One-third of the Southern voters said they were white Evangelicals and they voted for Bush by 80\u201320.<ref>{{cite news|title=Exit Polls|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.3.html|date=November 2, 2004|accessdate=November 18, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of George H.

Berman, ''America's Right Turn: From Nixon to Clinton'' (1998).</ref> In [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], for the first time in 12 years the United States had a Democrat in the White House. During President [[Bill Clinton]]'s term, the Congress balanced the federal [[budget]] for the first time since the Kennedy Presidency and presided over a robust American economy that saw incomes grow across the board. In 1994, the economy had the lowest combination of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. President Clinton also signed into law several [[gun control]] bills, including the [[Brady Bill]], which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases; and he also signed into legislation a [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|ban]] on many types of [[semi-automatic firearm]]s (which expired in 2004). His [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], covering some 40 million Americans, offered workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-guaranteed leave for childbirth or a personal or family illness. He deployed the U.S. military to [[Haiti]] to reinstate deposed president [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], took a strong hand in [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process|Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations]], brokered a historic cease-fire in [[Northern Ireland]] and negotiated the [[Dayton accords]]. In [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], Clinton became the first Democratic President to be re-elected since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].\n\nHowever, the Democrats lost their majority in both Houses of Congress in 1994. Clinton vetoed two Republican-backed [[welfare reform]] bills before signing the third, the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996. The [[tort reform]] [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] passed over his veto. Labor unions, which had been steadily losing membership since the 1960s, found they had also lost political clout inside the Democratic Party and Clinton enacted the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] over unions' strong objections.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kilborn|first=Peter T.|title=The Free Trade Accord: Labor, Unions Vow to Punish Pact's Backers|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 1993|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/us/the-free-trade-accord-labor-unions-vow-to-punish-pact-s-backers.html|accessdate=November 17, 2006}}</ref> In 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] Clinton on two charges, though he was subsequently acquitted by the [[United States Senate]] in 1999.

Jimmy Carter initiated the big push toward deregulation, generally with the support of his party in Congress. Bill Clinton presided over the growth of the loosely supervised shadow financial system and the repeal of Depression-era restrictions on commercial banks.<ref>Sebastian Mallaby.

Even though analysis of roll call votes show that since the 1970s, Republicans have drifted farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, the latter were instrumental in implementing financial deregulation in the 1990s and focused increasingly on cultural issues such as gender, race, and sexual identity rather than traditional social welfare policies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scheidel|first=Walter|author-link=Walter Scheidel|title=The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=|year=2017|isbn=978-0691165028|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA416#v=onepage&q&f=false 416]|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html}}</ref>\n\nBoth Carter and Clinton quietly abandoned the New Deal style of aggressive support for welfare for the poor and support for the working-class and labor unions. They downplayed traditional Democratic hostility toward business, and aggressive regulation of the economy. Carter and Clinton agreed on a greater reliance on the market economy\u2014As conservatives have long demanded. They gave control of inflation priority over reduction in unemployment. They both sought balanced budgets\u2014and Clinton actually succeeded in generating a federal budget surplus. They both used monetary policy more than fiscal/spending policy to micromanage the economy, and they accepted the conservative emphasis on supply-side programs to encourage private investment, and the expectation it would produce long-term economic growth.<ref>Iwan Morgan, \"Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and the new democratic economics.\" ''Historical Journal'' 47.4 (2004): 1015-1039.</ref>\n\n=== Election of 2000 ===\n{{main|United States presidential election, 2000}}\nDuring the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], the Democrats chose Vice President [[Al Gore]] to be the party's candidate for the presidency. Gore ran against [[George W. Bush]], the Republican candidate and son of former President [[George H. W. Bush]]. The issues Gore championed include [[national debt|debt reduction]], tax cuts, foreign policy, public education, [[global warming]], judicial appointments and [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]]. Nevertheless, Gore's affiliation with Clinton and the DLC caused critics to assert that Bush and Gore were too similar, especially on free trade, reductions in social welfare and the death penalty. [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in particular was very vocal in his criticisms.\n\nGore won a popular plurality of over 540,000 votes over Bush, but lost in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] by four votes. Many Democrats blamed Nader's third-party [[spoiler effect|spoiler role]] for Gore's defeat. They pointed to the states of New Hampshire (4 electoral votes) and Florida (25 electoral votes), where Nader's total votes exceeded Bush's margin of victory. In Florida, Nader received 97,000 votes and Bush defeated Gore by a mere 537. Controversy plagued the election and Gore largely dropped from elective politics.\n\nDespite Gore's close defeat, the Democrats gained five seats in the Senate (including the election of [[Hillary Clinton]] in New York) to turn a 55\u201345 Republican edge into a 50\u201350 split (with a Republican Vice President breaking a tie). However, when Republican Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of Vermont decided in 2001 to become an independent and vote with the Democratic caucus, the majority status shifted along with the seat, including control of the floor (by the Majority Leader) and control of all committee chairmanships. However, the Republicans regained their Senate majority with gains in 2002 and 2004, leaving the Democrats with only 44 seats, the fewest since the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|author=CQ Press|title=Guide to Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqN2AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA156|year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=156}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of George W.

All but one Democrat (Representative [[Barbara Lee]]) voted with their Republican counterparts to authorize President Bush's [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]. House leader [[Richard Gephardt]] and Senate leader [[Thomas Daschle]] pushed Democrats to vote for the [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. The Democrats were split over invading Iraq in 2003 and increasingly expressed concerns about both the justification and progress of the [[War on Terror]]ism as well as the domestic effects from the Patriot Act.<ref>It was renewed in 2006 by a vote of 280\u2013138 in the House (with Democrats breaking 66 for and 124 against) and 89-10 in the Senate (with Democrats splitting 33 in favor and 9 against). \"House approves Patriot Act renewal,\" CNN News, March 7, 2006.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nancy Pelosi.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Nancy Pelosi]] of California was the first woman to serve as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]]]]\nIn the wake of the financial fraud scandal of the [[Enron Corporation]] and other corporations, Congressional Democrats pushed for a legal overhaul of business accounting with the intention of preventing further [[Accounting scandals|accounting fraud]]. This led to the bipartisan [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in 2002. With job losses and bankruptcies across regions and industries increasing in 2001 and 2002, the Democrats generally campaigned on the issue of economic recovery. That did not work for them in 2002, as the Democrats lost a few seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. They lost three seats in the Senate ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as [[Max Cleland]] was unseated, [[Minnesota]] as Paul Wellstone died and [[Walter Mondale|his succeeding Democratic candidate]] lost the election and [[Missouri]] as [[Jean Carnahan]] was unseated). While Democrats gained governorships in [[New Mexico]] (where [[Bill Richardson]] was elected), [[Arizona]] ([[Janet Napolitano]]), [[Michigan]] ([[Jennifer Granholm]]) and [[Wyoming]] ([[Dave Freudenthal]]). Other Democrats lost governorships in [[South Carolina]] ([[Jim Hodges]]), [[Alabama]] ([[Don Siegelman]]) and\u2014for the first time in more than a century\u2014Georgia ([[Roy Barnes]]). The election led to another round of soul searching about the party's narrowing base. Democrats had further losses 2003, when a voter recall unseated the unpopular Democratic governor of California [[Gray Davis]] and replaced him with Republican [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

An unusual gaffe known as the \"Dean Scream\" and subsequent negative media coverage doomed his candidacy. The nomination went to Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]], a centrist with heavy support from the [[Democratic Leadership Council]]. Democrats pulled together in attacking Bush's war in Iraq. Kerry lost by a 3 million vote margin out of 120 million votes and lost four Senate seats. The Democrats had only 44 Senators, their fewest since the 1920s.

In addition, there is growing support for a [[Green New Deal]]: A set of laws, taxes, and projects that seek to drastically reduce carbon emissions and provide Americans with a plethora of jobs in the process. A notable new asset to the democratic caucus is Representative [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]], who at 29, is the youngest woman elected to congress. Ocasio-Cortez is an emerging leader in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, and her positions, campaign strategies, and support base indicate a leftward shift in Democratic politics.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chotiner |first1=Isaac |title=Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Takes the Democrats Back to the Future: An Interview with the Historian Rick Perlstein |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-takes-the-democrats-back-to-the-future-an-interview-with-the-historian-rick-perlstein |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=2019-02-25}}</ref>\n\n=== 2020 United States elections ===\n\n==== 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries ====\n{|\n[[File:Bernie_Sanders_wiki.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|Senator [[Bernie Sanders]]]]\n|[[File:Joe Biden wiki.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]]]]\n|}\nThe [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2020 primaries]] saw an unprecedentedly bloated and competitive field of 29 major candidates vie for the party's nomination, with the contest ultimately narrowing down to a binary race between Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden after [[Super Tuesday]] \u2014\u2014 a similar dynamic to the entirety of the 2016 primary.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Klahr |first1=Renee |title=2020 Presidential Candidates: Tracking Which Democrats Ran |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/01/31/689980506/which-democrats-are-running-in-2020-and-which-still-might |website=NPR |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref>However, the two-person period of this contest was never extended as long as in 2016, as the consolidation of the moderate half of the party, a series of wins in key swing states by Biden, and, moreover, the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 global pandemic]], allowed the former Vice President to push his last rival, Senator Sanders, out of the race by April. He formally suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, nearly 14 months after his launch in February of 2019. And on April 13, 2020, Sanders officially endorsed his chief rival and final remaining opponent, Joe Biden, via a joint live stream discussion. This was seen as the culmination of partisan coalescence around Biden, with former President Obama endorsing him the next day, unofficially ending the competitive stage of the primaries. Nevertheless, Sanders still sits on the ballot in every remaining state and will continue to accrue votes and delegates to take to the [[2020 Democratic National Convention|convention]] in August.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Epstein |first1=Kayla |title=Bernie Sanders vows to stay on upcoming ballots and continue to gather delegates so he can 'exert significant influence over the party platform' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/sanders-will-continue-gathering-delegates-to-influence-dnc-platform-2020-4 |website=Business Insider |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the primary, self-described socialist Senator Sanders ran a strong advocacy campaign (even referred to by some in the media as more of a movement), continuing to champion the same issues that [[Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign|his 2016 campaign for president]] featured, namely income inequality, Wall Street and corporate taxation, climate change awareness, and healthcare.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Waters-Smith |first1=Paul |title=The Bernie Sanders Movement is Achieving Things We Thought Impossible |url=https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/02/the-bernie-sanders-movement-is-achieving-things-we-thought-impossible |website=Current Affairs |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> His newly-released healthcare policy plan, dubbed Medicare-for-All, implementation of the [[Green New Deal]], as well as a proposal to eliminate all student debt and make public colleges tuition free were the three core elements of his 2020 campaign platform. \n\nRepresenting the more conservative, moderate side of the party, Vice President Biden positioned himself as an elder statesman ready to lead in moments of crisis that demanded strong executive experience. While his campaign lacked the policy luster that drew so many to Sanders, Biden was able to contrast himself starkly against the left-leaning platforms of Senators Sanders and [[Elizabeth Warren|Warren]] by promising to protect the Affordable Care Act against progressive efforts to further expand and nationalize it. This choice between the nostalgia and stability of more centrist Obama era policies, perceived by many as less of a liability against President Trump in November, and the high-risk, high-reward uncertainty of a far bolder, historically progressive vision became the defining narrative of the primary season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erickson |first1=Bo |title=Joe Biden prevails in nomination fight with electability argument |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-nomination-electability/ |website=CBS News |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> Ultimately, despite Joe Biden winning the most votes and delegates throughout the primary, polls showed that [[Bernie Sanders|Sanders]]'s progressive platform had more popular support than any other. Likely due to the threat of a second Trump term, though, voters were not willing to take the perceived risk of voting it into effect just yet due to the higher premium placed on simply winning the General Election. This led Senator Sanders to proudly declare that he had \"won the ideological war,\" as well as the \"generational debate,\" in reference to his enduring ideas and sustained strong support from younger voters.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lutz |first1=Eric |title=BERNIE SANDERS DECLARES IDEOLOGICAL VICTORY AS HE DROPS OUT OF 2020 RACE |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/bernie-sanders-declares-ideological-victory-as-he-drops-out-of-2020-race |website=Vanity Fair |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nDemographics-wise, Vice President Biden dominated with African Americans, suburban whites, voters over the age of 50, and newly-minted conservative Democrats who had joined the party after leaving the GOP in response to [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump]] and the stigma attached to his policies.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=Katelyn |title=Joe Biden\u2019s winning coalition: Black and suburban voters |url=https://www.vox.com/2020/3/4/21164494/joe-biden-coalition-black-suburban-voters |website=Vox |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> These former Republicans, and, to a lesser degree, elderly Black voters, are largely cited as the decisive demographics that tipped the scales in favor of Vice President Biden. Conversely, Senator Sanders led a similarly-diverse, but comparatively more urban, coalition of Latinos, Asian Americans, Muslim Americans, staunch progressives, and voters of all races under the age of 50.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Narea |first1=Nicole |title=Bernie Sanders\u2019s coalition of Latinos and young voters wasn\u2019t enough to help him win in Tuesday\u2019s primaries |url=https://www.vox.com/2020/3/11/21174591/bernie-sanders-latino-young-voter-coalition-michigan |website=Vox |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> However, many rural white working class voters that had supported him in his previous campaign no longer remained in the Democratic Party, having switched to either Independent or Republican status once Sanders lost the 2016 primary; therefore, most of their votes were no longer able to be cast for Sanders in this primary, costing him another key constituency that led to his ultimate defeat.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beauchamp |first1=Zack |title=Why Bernie Sanders failed |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/4/10/21214970/bernie-sanders-2020-lost-class-socialism |website=Vox |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> The gender balance between the Biden and Sanders campaigns was relatively the same, with equal parts women and men supporting each \u2014\u2014 a key difference between 2016 and 2020. Among the other major candidates, Elizabeth Warren's base consisted primarily of middle-aged, highly-educated white voters in coastal regions; [[Michael Bloomberg]] scooped up some votes on Super Tuesday within demographics similar to Joe Biden's (sans the strength with African Americans); [[Pete Buttigieg]] performed well in the first few primaries with moderate liberals and wealthier white voters, however, his campaign was doomed by a lack of appeal to minorities; and [[Amy Klobuchar]] proved to have relatively strong, albeit very limiting, Midwestern regional appeal.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Democratic National Convention]]\n* [[List of Democratic National Conventions]]\n\n; United States politics:\n* [[American election campaigns in the 19th century]]\n* [[History of the United States Republican Party]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Secondary sources ===\n* ''American National Biography'' (20 volumes, 1999) covers all politicians no longer alive; online and paper copies at many academic libraries.

During the [[Second Party System]] (from 1832 to the mid-1850s) under [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[James K. Polk]], the Democrats usually bested the opposition [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] by narrow margins.\n\nFrom 1860 to 1932 in the era of the [[American Civil War]] to the [[Great Depression]], the opposing [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], organized in the mid-1850s from the ruins of the Whig Party and some other smaller splinter groups, was dominant in [[United States presidential election|presidential politics]]. The Democrats elected [[List of United States Presidents|only two Presidents]] during this period: [[Grover Cleveland]] (in 1884 and 1892) and [[Woodrow Wilson]] (in 1912 and 1916). Over the same period, the Democrats proved more competitive with the Republicans in [[United States midterm election|Congressional politics]], enjoying [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] majorities (as in the [[65th United States Congress|65th Congress]]) in 15 of the 36 [[United States Congress|Congresses]] elected, although only in five of these did they form the majority in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Furthermore, the Democratic Party was split between the [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, representing Eastern business interests; and the agrarian elements comprising poor farmers in the South and West. The agrarian element, marching behind the slogan of [[free silver]] (i.e. in favor of inflation), captured the party in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the 1896, 1900 and 1908 presidential elections, although he lost every time. Both Bryan and Wilson were leaders of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] (1890s\u20131920s).\n\n[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Andrew Jackson]], founder of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the first [[President of the United States|President]] to be elected from the Democratic Party (1829\u20131837)]]\nStarting with 32nd President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1932 during the Great Depression, the party dominated the [[Fifth Party System]], with its [[Social liberalism|progressive liberal]] policies and programs with the [[New Deal coalition]] to combat the emergency bank closings and the continuing financial depression since the famous [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and later going into the crises leading up to [[World War II]]. The Democrats and the Democratic Party finally lost the [[White House]] and control of the executive branch of government only after Roosevelt's death in April 1945 near the end of the war and after the continuing post-war administration of Roosevelt's third [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], former [[United States Senator|Senator]] from Missouri (for 1945 to 1953, elections of [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]] and the \"stunner\" of [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]]). A new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] President was only elected later in the following decade of the early 1950s with the losses by two-time nominee, the [[Governor of Illinois]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] (grandson of the [[Adlai Stevenson I|former Vice President with the same name]] of the [[1892 United States presidential election|1890s]]) to the very popular war hero and commanding general in World War II, [[General of the Army (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]]).\n\nWith two brief interruptions since the Great Depression and World War II eras, the Democrats with unusually large majorities for over four decades, controlled the lower house of the Congress in the House of Representatives from 1930 until 1994 and the Senate for most of that same period, electing the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and the Representatives' majority leaders/committee chairs along with the upper house of the Senate's majority leaders and committee chairmen. Important Democratic progressive/liberal leaders included 33rd and 36th Presidents Harry S. Truman of [[Missouri]] (1945\u20131953) and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of [[Texas]] (1963\u20131969), respectively; and the earlier [[Kennedy family|Kennedy brothers]] of 35th President [[John F. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]] (1961\u20131963), Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] of [[New York State|New York]] and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts who carried the flag for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. Since the [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1976]], Democrats have won five out of the last eleven presidential elections, winning in the presidential elections of [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] (with 39th President [[Jimmy Carter]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1977\u20131981), [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] (with 42nd President [[Bill Clinton]] of [[Arkansas]], 1993\u20132001) and [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] (with 44th President [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]], 2009\u20132017). Democrats have also won the [[Plurality voting|popular vote]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], but lost the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] with [[Al Gore]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], respectively.

Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue that \"the Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s\".<ref>{{cite book|first1=Theodore|last1=Caplow|first2=Howard M.|last2=Bahr|first3=Bruce A.|last3=Chadwick|first4=John|last4=Modell|title=Recent Social Trends in the United States, 1960\u20131990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwBvm8aF2bsC&pg=PA337|year=1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=337|isbn=9780773512122}} They add: \"The Republican party, nationally, moved from right-center toward the center in 1940s and 1950s, then moved right again in the 1970s and 1980s.</ref>\n\n== Foundation: 1820-28 ==\nThe modern Democratic Party emerged in the late 1820s from former factions of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which had largely collapsed by 1824. It was built by [[Martin Van Buren]], who assembled a cadre of politicians in every state behind war hero [[Andrew Jackson]] of Tennessee.<ref>Robert V.

After the disappearance of the [[Federalist party|Federalists]] after 1815 and the [[Era of Good Feelings]] (1816\u20131824), there was a hiatus of weakly organized personal factions until about 1828\u20131832, when the modern Democratic Party emerged along with its rival, the Whigs. The new Democratic Party became a coalition of farmers, city-dwelling laborers and Irish Catholics.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005)</ref> Both parties worked hard to build [[grassroots]] organizations and maximize the turnout of voters, which often reached 80 percent or 90 percent of eligible voters. Both parties used [[Patronage#Politics|patronage]] extensively to finance their operations, which included emerging big city [[political machine]]s as well as national networks of newspapers.<ref>Michael Kazin, ed., ''The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (2011) pp 59-65, 159-62, 600-603.</ref>\n\nBehind the party platforms, acceptance speeches of candidates, editorials, pamphlets and stump speeches, there was a widespread consensus of political values among Democrats. As Mary Beth Norton explains: <blockquote>The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] concept of an [[agrarian society]]. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"[[Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]]\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. [...] Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual \u2013 the artisan and the ordinary farmer \u2013 by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of [[Banknote|paper currency]], which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like [[Education reform|educational reform]] and the establishment of a public education system....Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], initiating the removal of the [[Cherokee]]s along the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p. 287</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe party was weakest in [[New England]], but strong everywhere else and won most national elections thanks to strength in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] (by far the most populous states at the time) and the [[American frontier]]. Democrats opposed elites and aristocrats, the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] and the whiggish modernizing programs that would build up industry at the expense of the [[yeoman]] or independent small farmer.<ref>John Ashworth, ''\"Agrarians\" & \"Aristocrats\": Party Political Ideology in the United States, 1837\u20131846'' (1983).</ref>\n\nThe party was known for its populism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://utpress.org/title/andrew-jackson-and-the-rise-of-the-democratic-party/|title=Andrew Jackson and the Rise of the Democratic Party - University of Tennessee Press|publisher=}}</ref> Historian Frank Towers has specified an important ideological divide: <blockquote>Democrats stood for the 'sovereignty of the people' as expressed in popular demonstrations, constitutional conventions, and majority rule as a general principle of governing, whereas Whigs advocated the rule of law, written and unchanging constitutions, and protections for minority interests against majority tyranny.<ref>Frank Towers, \"Mobtown's Impact on the Study of Urban Politics in the Early Republic.\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 107 (Winter 2012) pp. 469\u201375, p. 472, citing Robert E, Shalhope, ''The Baltimore Bank Riot: Political Upheaval in Antebellum Maryland'' (2009) p. 147.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt its inception, the Democratic Party was the party of the \"common man\".<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2013/04/10/wait-whose-plantation-now/|title=Wait, Whose Plantation Now? - The Edge of the American West|first=David|last=Silbey|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}</ref> It opposed the abolition of slavery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/12/8/7328755/maps-democratic-party|title=23 maps that explain how Democrats went from the party of racism to the party of Obama|first=Andrew|last=Prokop|date=8 December 2014|website=Vox}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nFrom 1828 to 1848, banking and tariffs were the central domestic policy issues. Democrats strongly favored\u2014and Whigs opposed\u2014expansion to new farm lands, as typified by their expulsion of eastern [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and acquisition of vast amounts of new land in the West after 1846. The party favored the [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with Mexico]] and opposed anti-immigrant [[nativism (politics)|nativism]]. In the 1830s, the [[Locofocos]] in New York City were radically democratic, anti-monopoly and were proponents of [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]] and [[free trade]].<ref>Earle (2004), p. 19</ref><ref>Taylor (2006), p. 54</ref> Their chief spokesman was [[William Leggett (USA)|William Leggett]]. At this time, [[labor union]]s were few and some were loosely affiliated with the party.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''Chants Democratic: New York City and the Rise of the American Working Class, 1788\u20131850'' (1984)</ref>\n\n=== Presidency of Martin Van Buren (1837\u20131841) ===\n[[Martin Van Buren]] was key in the development of the Democratic Party, although his presidency featured many setbacks. Many of the policies of Jackson had repercussions while Van Buren held office, such as the [[Trail of Tears]]. The policies enacted during Jackson came into full swing during Van Buren, who oversaw the displacement of thousands of Native Americans. In addition to this, Van Buren was anti-slavery and represented a divide in both parties. Despite this, he did almost nothing to help the abolitionist movement and his presidency saw a continuation of pro-slavery legislation. Jackson's decision to abolish the [[Second Bank of the United States]] led to the [[Panic of 1837]] during Van Buren's presidency, leading to disapproval by the public and loss of power for his party.\n\nThe 1840 Democratic convention was the first at which the party adopted a platform. Delegates reaffirmed their belief that the Constitution was the primary guide for each state's political affairs. To them, this meant that all roles of the federal government not specifically defined fell to each respective state government, including such responsibilities as debt created by local projects. Decentralized power and states' rights pervaded each and every resolution adopted at the convention, including those on slavery, taxes, and the possibility of a central bank.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/polcon/democraticindex.html |title= 1840 Democratic Convention |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030799376 |title=Proceedings of the National democratic convention, held in ...

The Whigs nominated [[William Henry Harrison]] as their candidate for the 1840 presidential race. Harrison won as the first President of the Whigs. However, he died in office a month later and was succeeded by his Vice President [[John Tyler]]. Tyler had recently left the Democrats for the Whigs and thus his beliefs did not align much with the Whig Party. During his presidency, he vetoed many of his own party's bills, leading to his own party disowning him. This allowed for the Democrats to retake power in 1845.\n\n== Presidency of James K. Polk (1845\u20131849) ==\nForeign policy was a major issue in the 1840s as war threatened with Mexico over Texas and with Britain over Oregon. Democrats strongly supported [[Manifest Destiny]] and most Whigs strongly opposed it. The [[1844 United States presidential election|1844 election]] was a showdown, with the Democrat [[James K. Polk]] narrowly defeating Whig [[Henry Clay]] on the Texas issue.<ref>Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America 1815\u20131848'' (2007) pp. 705\u2013706.</ref>\n\n[[John Mack Faragher]]'s analysis of the political polarization between the parties is: <blockquote>Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the [[Northern United States|North]]) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by [[Technological and industrial history of the United States|industrialization]] but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|territories]]. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed. [...] For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.<ref>John Mack Faragher et al. ''Out of Many: A History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 1997) p. 413</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Free Soil split===\nIn [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]] a major innovation was the creation of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) to coordinate state activities in the presidential contest. Senator [[Lewis Cass]], who held many offices over the years, lost to General [[Zachary Taylor]] of the Whigs. A major cause of the defeat was that the new [[Free Soil Party]], which opposed slavery expansion, split the Democratic vote, particularly in New York, where the electoral votes went to Taylor.<ref>Frederick J. Blue, ''The Free Soilers: Third Party Politics, 1848-54'' (1973).</ref> The Free Soil Party attracted Democrats, and some Whigs, and had considerable support in the Northeast. The primary doctrine was a warning that rich slave owners would move into new territories such as Nebraska and buy up the best lands, and work them with slaves. To protect the white farmer it was essential therefore to keep the soil \"free\"\u2014that is without slavery. The fate of the slaves was not of concern. In 1852, the free soil movement was much smaller, and consisted primarily of former members of the Liberty Party and some abolitionists, it hedged on the question of full equality. The majority wanted some form of racial separation to allow space for black activism, without alienating the overwhelming northern opposition to equal rights for black men.<ref>Eric  Foner,  \"Politics and Prejudice: The Free Soil Party and the Negro, 1849-1852.\" ''Journal of Negro History'' 50.4 (1965): 239-256. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716247 online]</ref>\n\n== Presidencies of Zachary Taylor (1849\u20131850) and Millard Fillmore (1850\u20131853) ==\nFollowing the death of President Taylor, Democrats in Congress passed the [[Compromise of 1850]] designed to avoid civil war by putting the slavery issue to rest while resolves issued involving territories gained following the War with Mexico. However, in state after state the Democrats gained small but permanent advantages over the Whig Party, which finally collapsed in 1852, fatally weakened by division on slavery and [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]]. The fragmented opposition could not stop the election of Democrats [[Franklin Pierce]] in [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] and [[James Buchanan]] in [[1856 United States presidential election|1856]].<ref>Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005) ch. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\n== The presidencies of Franklin Pierce (1853\u201357) and James Buchanan (1857\u201361) ==\n[[file:Augustbelmont.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|August Belmont: DNC Chair for 12 years during and after the Civil war]]\n\nThe eight years during which Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan held the presidency were disasters; historians agree that they rank as among the worst presidents. The Party increasingly split along regional lines. In 1860 two Democrats ran for president and the United States was moving rapidly toward civil war.<ref>David M. Potter, ''The Impending Crisis, 1848\u20131861'' (1976) pp 225-67.</ref>\n\n=== Young America ===\nYonatan Eyal (2007) argues that the 1840s and 1850s were the heyday of a new faction of young Democrats called \"[[Young America movement|Young America]]\". Led by [[Stephen A. Douglas]], James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce and New York financier [[August Belmont]], this faction explains, broke with the agrarian and [[Strict constructionism|strict constructionist]] orthodoxies of the past and embraced commerce, technology, regulation, reform and internationalism. The movement attracted a circle of outstanding writers, including [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[George Bancroft]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].

Young America claimed that modernization would perpetuate the agrarian vision of [[Jeffersonian democracy]] by allowing yeomen farmers to sell their products and therefore to prosper. They tied internal improvements to [[free trade]], while accepted moderate tariffs as a necessary source of government revenue.

The conflict was papered over at the [[1852 Democratic National Convention|1852]] and [[1856 Democratic National Convention|1856 conventions]] by selecting men who had little involvement in sectionalism, but they made matters worse. Historian [[Roy F. Nichols]] explains why [[Franklin Pierce]] was not up to the challenges a Democratic president had to face:\n:As a national political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]] on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.<ref>Roy F.

The demands were to support slavery outside the South. Southerners insisted that full equality for their region required the government to acknowledge the legitimacy of slavery outside the South. The Southern demands included a fugitive slave law to recapture runaway slaves; opening Kansas to slavery; forcing a pro-slavery constitution on Kansas; acquire Cuba (where slavery already existed); accepting the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court; and adopting a federal slave code to protect slavery in the territories. President Buchanan went along with these demands, but Douglas refused and proved a much better politician than Buchanan, though the bitter battle lasted for years and permanently alienated the Northern and Southern wings.<ref>Michael Todd Landis. ''Northern Men with Southern Loyalties: The Democratic Party and the Sectional Crisis'' (2014).</ref>\n\nWhen the new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] formed in 1854 on the basis of refusing to tolerate the expansion of slavery into the territories, many northern Democrats (especially [[Free Soil Party|Free Soilers]] from 1848) joined it.

No party politics were allowed in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], whose political leadership, mindful of the welter prevalent in antebellum American politics and with a pressing need for unity, largely viewed political parties as inimical to good governance and as being especially unwise in wartime.

Weber, ''Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln's Opponents in the North'' (2006)</ref>\n\nPartisanship flourished in the North and strengthened the Lincoln Administration as Republicans automatically rallied behind it. After the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], Douglas rallied Northern Democrats behind the Union, but when Douglas died the party lacked an outstanding figure in the North and by 1862 an anti-war peace element was gaining strength. The most intense anti-war elements were the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]].<ref name=\"Jennifer L.

There was also an expression of annoyance with the federal prohibition of beer and wine, and the closing of most saloons.<ref>David Berner, ''The Politics of Provincialism: The Democratic party in transition, 1918-1932'' (1968)</ref><ref>Ciment, ''Encyclopedia of the Jazz Age''  (2008) 1:195-96, 263-64, 2:298-305,  2:519-23</ref>\n\n=== Culture conflict and Al Smith (1924\u201328) ===\nAt the [[1924 Democratic National Convention]], a resolution denouncing the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was introduced by Catholic and liberal forces allied with [[Al Smith]] and [[Oscar W. Underwood]] in order to embarrass the front-runner, [[William Gibbs McAdoo]]. After much debate, the resolution failed by a single vote. The KKK faded away soon after, but the deep split in the party over cultural issues, especially prohibition, facilitated Republican landslides in [[1924 United States presidential election|1924]] and [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]].<ref>Robert K. Murray, ''The 103rd Ballot: Democrats and Disaster in Madison Square Garden'' (1976)</ref> However, Al Smith did build a strong Catholic base in the big cities in 1928 and [[Franklin D.

To a considerable extent, the challenge of restoring morale was the province of historian [[Claude Bowers]]. His histories of the Democratic Party in its formative years from the 1790s to the 1830s helped shape the party's self-image as a powerful force against monopoly and privilege. In his enormously popular books ''Party Battles of the Jackson Period'' (1922) and ''Jefferson and Hamilton: The Struggle for Democracy in America'' (1925) he argued for the political and moral superiority of the Democratic Party since the days of Jefferson versus the almost un-American faults of the [[Federalist Party]], the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], as bastions of aristocracy. ''Jefferson and Hamilton'' especially impressed his friend [[Franklin D Roosevelt]]. It inspired Roosevelt when he became president to build a great monument to the party's founder in the national capital, the [[Jefferson Memorial]]. According to Historian [[Merrill D. Peterson]], the book conveyed:\n<blockquote>the myth of the Democratic Party masterfully re-created, a fresh awareness of the elemental differences between the parties, and ideology with which they might make sense of the two often senseless conflicts of the present, and a feeling for the importance of dynamic leadership. The book was a mirror for Democrats.<ref>{{cite book|first=Merrill D.|last=Peterson|title=The Jefferson Image in the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QNrZoAgGAsC&pg=PA351|year=1960|page=351|isbn=9780813918518}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== The Great Depression and a Second World War: Democratic hegemony (1930\u201353) ==\nThe Great Depression marred Hoover's term as the Democratic Party made large gains in the 1930 congressional elections and garnered a landslide win in 1932.\n\n=== Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933\u20131945) ===\n[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the longest-serving President of the United States (1933\u20131945)]]\nThe [[Wall Street Crash 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]] set the stage for a more progressive government and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] won a [[landslide victory]] in the [[1932 United States presidential election|election of 1932]], campaigning on a platform of \"Relief, Recovery, and Reform\", that is relief of unemployment and rural distress, recovery of the economy back to normal and long-term structural reforms to prevent a repetition of the Depression. This came to be termed \"[[New Deal|The New Deal]]\" after a phrase in Roosevelt's acceptance speech.<ref>Robert T. Oliver, \"The speech that established Roosevelt's reputation.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech '' 31#3   (1945): 274-282.</ref>\n\nThe Democrats also swept to large majorities in both houses of Congress and among state governors. Roosevelt altered the nature of the party, away from ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and towards an ideology of economic regulation and insurance against hardship. Two old words took on new meanings: \"liberal\" now meant a supporter of the New Deal while \"conservative\" meant an opponent.<ref>[[Pamela Johnston Conover]], and Stanley Feldman, \"The origins and meaning of liberal/conservative self-identifications.\" ''American Journal of Political Science'' 25#4 (1981), pp. 617-645 617-645.</ref>\n\n[[Conservative Democrat]]s were outraged and led by [[Al Smith]] they formed the [[American Liberty League]] in 1934 and counterattacked. They failed and either retired from politics or joined the Republican Party. A few of them, such as [[Dean Acheson]], found their way back to the Democratic Party.<ref>Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1958) pp 227-46.</ref>\n\nThe 1933 programs, called \"the First New Deal\" by historians, represented a broad consensus. Roosevelt tried to reach out to business and labor, farmers and consumers, cities and countryside. However, by 1934 he was moving toward a more confrontational policy. After making gains in state governorships and in Congress, in 1934 Roosevelt embarked on an ambitious legislative program that came to be called \"The [[Second New Deal]]\". It was characterized by building up labor unions, nationalizing welfare by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], setting up [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], imposing more regulations on business (especially transportation and communications) and raising taxes on business profits.<ref>James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox: Vol. 1, 1882-1940'' (1958) pp 171-208.</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's New Deal programs focused on job creation through [[public works]] projects as well as on social welfare programs such as Social Security. It also included sweeping reforms to the banking system, work regulation, transportation, communications and stock markets, as well as attempts to regulate prices. His policies soon paid off by uniting a diverse coalition of Democratic voters called the [[New Deal coalition]], which included labor unions, Southerners, minorities (most significantly, Catholics and Jews) and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]]. This united voter base allowed Democrats to be elected to Congress and the presidency for much of the next 30 years.<ref>Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1958) pp 264-90.</ref>\n\n===The Second term===\nAfter a triumphant re-election in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]], he announced plans to [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|enlarge the Supreme Court]], which tended to oppose his New Deal, by five new members. A firestorm of opposition erupted, led by his own Vice President [[John Nance Garner]]. Roosevelt was defeated by an alliance of Republicans and conservative Democrats, who formed a [[conservative coalition]] that managed to block nearly all liberal legislation (only a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage law]] got through). Annoyed by the conservative wing of his own party, Roosevelt made an attempt to rid himself of it and in 1938 he actively campaigned against five incumbent conservative Democratic senators, though all five senators won re-election.<ref>Milton Plesur,  \"The Republican congressional comeback of 1938.\" ''Review of Politics'' 24.4 (1962): 525-562.</ref>\n\n===The Party===\nUnder Roosevelt, the Democratic Party became identified more closely with modern liberalism, which included the promotion of [[social welfare]], [[labor unions]], [[civil rights]] and the regulation of business, as well as support for farmers and promotion of ethnic leaders. The opponents, who stressed long-term growth and support for entrepreneurship and low taxes, now started calling themselves \"conservatives\".<ref>Sean J. Savage, ''Roosevelt: The Party Leader, 1932-1945'' (2015).</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nWith a near disaster in 1937 with the so-called \"recession\" and the near defeat in Congress in 1938, things looked bleak for the Democrats, but FDR decided that he with the upcoming crisis that would become World War II, he was irreplaceable, and he broke tradition and ran for a third, and later 4th term, taking a Democratic congress with him.\n\n=== Presidency of Harry S. Truman (1945\u20131953) ===\n[[Harry S. Truman]] took over after Roosevelt's death in 1945 and the rifts inside the party that Roosevelt had papered over began to emerge. Major components included the big city machines, the Southern state and local parties, the far-left and the \"Liberal coalition\" or \"Liberal-Labor coalition\" comprising the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]], [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] and ideological groups such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] (representing [[African American|Blacks]]), the [[American Jewish Congress]] (AJC) and the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) (representing liberal intellectuals).<ref>\nDaniel Disalvo. \"The Politics of a Party Faction: The Liberal-Labor Alliance in the Democratic Party, 1948\u20131972,\" ''Journal of Policy History'' (2010) vol.  22#3 pp. 269\u201399 in [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_policy_history/v022/22.3.disalvo.html Project MUSE]</ref> By 1948, the unions had expelled nearly all the far-left and communist elements.<ref>Max M.

However, all of Truman's [[Fair Deal]] proposals, such as [[universal health care]], were defeated by the Southern Democrats in Congress.

Wallace]] denounced Truman as a war-monger for his anti-Soviet programs, the [[Truman Doctrine]], [[Marshall Plan]] and [[NATO]]. Wallace quit the party and ran for [[1948 United States presidential election|President as an independent in 1948]]. He called for [[d\u00e9tente]] with the [[Soviet Union\u2013United States relations|Soviet Union]], but much of his campaign was controlled by communists who had been expelled from the main unions.

Wallace supporters and other Democrats who were farther left were pushed out of the party and the CIO in 1946\u20131948 by young anti-communists like [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Walter Reuther]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] [[Hollywood]] emerged in the 1940s as an important new base in the party and was led by movie-star politicians such as [[Ronald Reagan]], who strongly supported Roosevelt and Truman at this time.<ref>{{cite book|first=Edward M.|last=Yager|title=Ronald Reagan's Journey: Democrat to Republican|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2cs7IHERBwC&pg=PA43|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=43|isbn=9780742544215}}</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, Europe was safe, but troubles mounted in Asia as China fell to the communists in 1949. Truman entered the [[Korean War]] without formal Congressional approval. When the war turned to a stalemate and he fired General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in 1951, Republicans blasted his policies in Asia. A series of petty scandals among friends and buddies of Truman further tarnished his image, allowing the Republicans in 1952 to crusade against \"Korea, Communism and Corruption\". Truman dropped out of the Presidential race early in 1952, leaving no obvious successor. The convention nominated [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], only to see him overwhelmed by two Eisenhower landslides.<ref>{{cite book|first=Kenneth F.|last=Warren|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Campaigns, Elections, and Electoral Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCh1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA634|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=634|isbn=9781452265872}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of Dwight D.

It also brought brief Republican control to both houses of Congress for one term. In Congress, the powerful team of Texans House Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] and Senate Majority leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] held the party together, often by compromising with Eisenhower. In 1958, the party made dramatic gains in the midterms and seemed to have a permanent lock on Congress, thanks largely to organized labor. Indeed, Democrats had majorities in the House every election from 1930 to 1992 (except 1946 and 1952).<ref>{{cite book|first1=Earl|last1=Black|first2=Merle|last2=Black|title=Divided America: The Ferocious Power Struggle in American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm8eHHDR_osC&pg=PT23|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=23 |isbn=9781416539056}}</ref>\n\nMost Southern Congressmen were [[conservative Democrats]] and they usually worked with conservative Republicans.<ref>James T.

He challenged America in the [[Space Race]] to land an American man on the moon by 1969. After the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] he moved to de-escalate tensions with the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>James N. Giglio, ''Presidency of John F.

His election did mark the coming of age of the Catholic component of the New Deal Coalition. After 1964, middle class Catholics started voting Republican in the same proportion as their Protestant neighbors. Except for the Chicago of [[Richard J.

In January, even though it was a military defeat for the [[Viet Cong]], the [[Tet Offensive]] began to turn American public opinion against the Vietnam War. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] rallied intellectuals and [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] students on college campuses and came within a few percentage points of defeating Johnson in the [[New Hampshire primary]]:Johnson was permanently weakened.

Kennedy won the critical California primary on June 4, but [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|he was assassinated]] that night.

Nixon barely won, with the Democrats retaining control of Congress.

In addition, he championed [[human rights]] throughout the world and used human rights as the center of his administration's foreign policy.<ref name=\"John Dumbrell 1995\">John Dumbrell, ''The Carter presidency: A re-evaluation'' (Manchester University Press, 1995)</ref>\n\nEven with all of these successes, Carter failed to implement a national health plan or to reform the tax system as he had promised in his campaign and inflation was also on the rise. Abroad, the [[Iranian hostage crisis|Iranians held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days]] and Carter's diplomatic and military rescue attempts failed. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] later that year further disenchanted some Americans with Carter. In [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], Carter defeated Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] to gain renomination, but lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] in November. The Democrats lost 12 Senate seats and for the first time since 1954 the Republicans controlled the Senate, though the House remained in Democratic hands.<ref name=\"John Dumbrell 1995\"/> After his defeat, Carter negotiated the release of every American hostage held in Iran and they were lifted out of Iran minutes after Reagan was inaugurated, ending a 444-day crisis.<ref>David Farber, ''Taken Hostage: The Iran Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam'' (2005)</ref>\n\n== Presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981\u20131989) ==\n=== 1980s: Battling Reaganism ===\n[[File:SpeakerO'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Representative [[Tip O'Neill|Thomas \"Tip\" O'Neill]] was Speaker of the House (1977\u20131987) and was the highest ranking Democrat in Washington, D.C. during most of Reagan's term]]\nDemocrats who supported many conservative policies were instrumental in the election of Republican [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]]. The \"[[Reagan Democrat]]s\" were Democrats before the Reagan years and afterward, but they voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] and for [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], producing their landslide victories. Reagan Democrats were mostly white ethnics in the Northeast and Midwest who were attracted to Reagan's [[social conservatism]] on issues such as abortion and to his strong foreign policy. They did not continue to vote Republican in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] or [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], so the term fell into disuse except as a reference to the 1980s. The term is not used to describe [[White Southerners]] who became permanent Republicans in presidential elections.<ref name=\"Stanley B. Greenberg 1996\">Stanley B. Greenberg, ''Middle Class Dreams: Politics and Power of the New American Majority'' (1996).</ref>\n\n[[Stan Greenberg]], a Democratic pollster, analyzed white ethnic voters \u2013 largely unionized auto workers \u2013 in suburban [[Macomb County, Michigan]], just north of Detroit. The county voted 63 percent for Kennedy in 1960 and 66 percent for Reagan in 1984. He concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead saw it as a party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially African Americans, [[advocacy group]]s of the [[political left]] and the very poor.<ref name=\"Stanley B. Greenberg 1996\"/>\n\nThe failure to hold the Reagan Democrats and the white South led to the final collapse of the New Deal coalition. In [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], Reagan carried 49 states against former Vice President and Minnesota Senator [[Walter Mondale]], a New Deal stalwart.<ref>Steven M. Gillon, ''The Democrats' Dilemma: Walter F. Mondale and the Liberal Legacy'' (1992) pp. 365\u201390</ref>\n\nIn response to these landslide defeats, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC) was created in 1985. It worked to move the party rightwards to the ideological center in order to recover some of the fundraising that had been lost to the Republicans due to corporate donors supporting Reagan. The goal was to retain left-of-center voters as well as moderates and conservatives on social issues to become a [[Big tent|catch all party]] with widespread appeal to most opponents of the Republicans. Despite this, Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], running not as a New Dealer but as an efficiency expert in public administration, lost by a landslide in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] to Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>Jack W. Germond and Jules Witcover. ''Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?'' (1989)</ref>\n\n=== South becomes Republican ===\nFor nearly a century after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the white South identified with the Democratic Party. The Democrats' lock on power was so strong the region was called the [[Solid South]], although the Republicans controlled parts of the [[Appalachian mountains]] and they competed for statewide office in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]. Before 1948, [[Southern Democrats]] believed that their party, with its respect for [[states' rights]] and appreciation of traditional southern values, was the defender of the Southern way of life. Southern Democrats warned against aggressive designs on the part of Northern liberals and Republicans and civil rights activists whom they denounced as \"outside agitators\".<ref>Joseph A. Aistrup, ''The southern strategy revisited: Republican top-down advancement in the South'' (2015).</ref>\n\nThe adoption of the strong civil rights plank by the 1948 convention and the integration of the armed forces by President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Executive Order 9981]], which provided for equal treatment and opportunity for African-American servicemen, drove a wedge between the Northern and Southern branches of the party. The party was sharply divided in the [[1948 United States presidential election|following election]], as [[Southern Democrats]] [[Strom Thurmond]] ran as \"States' Rights Democratic Party\".\n\nWith the presidency of John F. Kennedy the Democratic Party began to embrace the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and its lock on the South was irretrievably broken. Upon signing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], President Lyndon B. Johnson prophesied: \"We have lost the South for a generation\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Risen|first=Clay|title=How the South was won|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=March 5, 2006|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/03/05/how_the_south_was_won/|accessdate=November 24, 2006}}</ref>\n\nModernization had brought factories, national businesses and larger, more cosmopolitan cities such as [[Atlanta]], [[Dallas]], [[Charlotte]] and [[Houston]] to the South, as well as millions of migrants from the North and more opportunities for higher education. Meanwhile, the cotton and tobacco economy of the traditional rural South faded away, as former farmers commuted to factory jobs. As the South became more like the rest of the nation, it could not stand apart in terms of racial segregation. Integration and the Civil Rights Movement caused enormous controversy in the white South, with many attacking it as a violation of states' rights. When segregation was outlawed by court order and by the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, a die-hard element resisted integration, led by Democratic governors [[Orval Faubus]] of Arkansas, [[Lester Maddox]] of Georgia and especially [[George Wallace]] of Alabama. These populist governors appealed to a less-educated, blue-collar electorate that on economic grounds favored the Democratic Party and opposed desegregation. After 1965, most Southerners accepted integration (with the exception of public schools).<ref>Jon P, Alston, and Ben M. Crouch. \"White acceptance of three degrees of school desegregation, 1974.\" ''Phylon'' 39.3 (1978): 216-224.</ref>\n\nBelieving themselves betrayed by the Democratic Party, traditional [[White Southerners]] joined the new middle-class and the Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party. Meanwhile, newly enfranchised black voters began supporting Democratic candidates at the 80\u201390 percent levels, producing Democratic leaders such as [[Julian Bond]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of Georgia and [[Barbara Jordan]] of Texas. Just as [[Martin Luther King]] had promised, integration had brought about a new day in Southern politics.<ref>Katherine Tate, ''Black faces in the mirror: African Americans and their representatives in the US Congress'' (2018).</ref>\n \nIn addition to its white middle-class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities among [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]], who prior to the 1980s were largely apolitical. Exit polls in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]] showed that [[George W. Bush]] led [[John Kerry]] by 70\u201330% among White Southerners, who were 71% of the voters. Kerry had a 90\u20139 lead among the 18% of Southern voters who were black. One-third of the Southern voters said they were white Evangelicals and they voted for Bush by 80\u201320.<ref>{{cite news|title=Exit Polls|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.3.html|date=November 2, 2004|accessdate=November 18, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of George H.

Berman, ''America's Right Turn: From Nixon to Clinton'' (1998).</ref> In [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], for the first time in 12 years the United States had a Democrat in the White House. During President [[Bill Clinton]]'s term, the Congress balanced the federal [[budget]] for the first time since the Kennedy Presidency and presided over a robust American economy that saw incomes grow across the board. In 1994, the economy had the lowest combination of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. President Clinton also signed into law several [[gun control]] bills, including the [[Brady Bill]], which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases; and he also signed into legislation a [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|ban]] on many types of [[semi-automatic firearm]]s (which expired in 2004). His [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], covering some 40 million Americans, offered workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-guaranteed leave for childbirth or a personal or family illness. He deployed the U.S. military to [[Haiti]] to reinstate deposed president [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], took a strong hand in [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process|Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations]], brokered a historic cease-fire in [[Northern Ireland]] and negotiated the [[Dayton accords]]. In [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], Clinton became the first Democratic President to be re-elected since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].\n\nHowever, the Democrats lost their majority in both Houses of Congress in 1994. Clinton vetoed two Republican-backed [[welfare reform]] bills before signing the third, the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996. The [[tort reform]] [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] passed over his veto. Labor unions, which had been steadily losing membership since the 1960s, found they had also lost political clout inside the Democratic Party and Clinton enacted the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] over unions' strong objections.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kilborn|first=Peter T.|title=The Free Trade Accord: Labor, Unions Vow to Punish Pact's Backers|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 1993|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/us/the-free-trade-accord-labor-unions-vow-to-punish-pact-s-backers.html|accessdate=November 17, 2006}}</ref> In 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] Clinton on two charges, though he was subsequently acquitted by the [[United States Senate]] in 1999.

Bill Clinton presided over the growth of the loosely supervised shadow financial system and the repeal of Depression-era restrictions on commercial banks.<ref>Sebastian Mallaby.

Even though analysis of roll call votes show that since the 1970s, Republicans have drifted farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, the latter were instrumental in implementing financial deregulation in the 1990s and focused increasingly on cultural issues such as gender, race, and sexual identity rather than traditional social welfare policies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scheidel|first=Walter|author-link=Walter Scheidel|title=The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=|year=2017|isbn=978-0691165028|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA416#v=onepage&q&f=false 416]|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html}}</ref>\n\nBoth Carter and Clinton quietly abandoned the New Deal style of aggressive support for welfare for the poor and support for the working-class and labor unions. They downplayed traditional Democratic hostility toward business, and aggressive regulation of the economy. Carter and Clinton agreed on a greater reliance on the market economy\u2014As conservatives have long demanded. They gave control of inflation priority over reduction in unemployment. They both sought balanced budgets\u2014and Clinton actually succeeded in generating a federal budget surplus. They both used monetary policy more than fiscal/spending policy to micromanage the economy, and they accepted the conservative emphasis on supply-side programs to encourage private investment, and the expectation it would produce long-term economic growth.<ref>Iwan Morgan, \"Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and the new democratic economics.\" ''Historical Journal'' 47.4 (2004): 1015-1039.</ref>\n\n=== Election of 2000 ===\n{{main|United States presidential election, 2000}}\nDuring the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], the Democrats chose Vice President [[Al Gore]] to be the party's candidate for the presidency. Gore ran against [[George W. Bush]], the Republican candidate and son of former President [[George H. W. Bush]]. The issues Gore championed include [[national debt|debt reduction]], tax cuts, foreign policy, public education, [[global warming]], judicial appointments and [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]]. Nevertheless, Gore's affiliation with Clinton and the DLC caused critics to assert that Bush and Gore were too similar, especially on free trade, reductions in social welfare and the death penalty. [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in particular was very vocal in his criticisms.\n\nGore won a popular plurality of over 540,000 votes over Bush, but lost in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] by four votes. Many Democrats blamed Nader's third-party [[spoiler effect|spoiler role]] for Gore's defeat. They pointed to the states of New Hampshire (4 electoral votes) and Florida (25 electoral votes), where Nader's total votes exceeded Bush's margin of victory. In Florida, Nader received 97,000 votes and Bush defeated Gore by a mere 537. Controversy plagued the election and Gore largely dropped from elective politics.\n\nDespite Gore's close defeat, the Democrats gained five seats in the Senate (including the election of [[Hillary Clinton]] in New York) to turn a 55\u201345 Republican edge into a 50\u201350 split (with a Republican Vice President breaking a tie). However, when Republican Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of Vermont decided in 2001 to become an independent and vote with the Democratic caucus, the majority status shifted along with the seat, including control of the floor (by the Majority Leader) and control of all committee chairmanships. However, the Republicans regained their Senate majority with gains in 2002 and 2004, leaving the Democrats with only 44 seats, the fewest since the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|author=CQ Press|title=Guide to Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqN2AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA156|year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=156}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of George W.

All but one Democrat (Representative [[Barbara Lee]]) voted with their Republican counterparts to authorize President Bush's [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]. House leader [[Richard Gephardt]] and Senate leader [[Thomas Daschle]] pushed Democrats to vote for the [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].

This led to the bipartisan [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in 2002. With job losses and bankruptcies across regions and industries increasing in 2001 and 2002, the Democrats generally campaigned on the issue of economic recovery. That did not work for them in 2002, as the Democrats lost a few seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. They lost three seats in the Senate ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as [[Max Cleland]] was unseated, [[Minnesota]] as Paul Wellstone died and [[Walter Mondale|his succeeding Democratic candidate]] lost the election and [[Missouri]] as [[Jean Carnahan]] was unseated). While Democrats gained governorships in [[New Mexico]] (where [[Bill Richardson]] was elected), [[Arizona]] ([[Janet Napolitano]]), [[Michigan]] ([[Jennifer Granholm]]) and [[Wyoming]] ([[Dave Freudenthal]]). Other Democrats lost governorships in [[South Carolina]] ([[Jim Hodges]]), [[Alabama]] ([[Don Siegelman]]) and\u2014for the first time in more than a century\u2014Georgia ([[Roy Barnes]]). The election led to another round of soul searching about the party's narrowing base.

An unusual gaffe known as the \"Dean Scream\" and subsequent negative media coverage doomed his candidacy.

He formally suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, nearly 14 months after his launch in February of 2019; an endorsement of his chief rival and presumptive nominee, Joe Biden, remains outstanding. Nevertheless, Sanders still sits on the ballot in every remaining state and will continue to accrue votes and delegates to take to the [[2020 Democratic National Convention|convention]] in August.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Epstein |first1=Kayla |title=Bernie Sanders vows to stay on upcoming ballots and continue to gather delegates so he can 'exert significant influence over the party platform' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/sanders-will-continue-gathering-delegates-to-influence-dnc-platform-2020-4 |website=Business Insider |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the primary, self-described socialist Senator Sanders ran a strong advocacy campaign (even referred to by some in the media as more of a movement), continuing to champion the same issues that [[Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign|his 2016 campaign for president]] featured, namely income inequality, Wall Street and corporate taxation, climate change awareness, and healthcare.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Waters-Smith |first1=Paul |title=The Bernie Sanders Movement is Achieving Things We Thought Impossible |url=https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/02/the-bernie-sanders-movement-is-achieving-things-we-thought-impossible |website=Current Affairs |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> His newly-released healthcare policy plan, dubbed Medicare-for-All, implementation of the [[Green New Deal]], as well as a proposal to eliminate all student debt and make public colleges tuition free were the three core elements of his 2020 campaign platform. \n\nRepresenting the more conservative, moderate side of the party, Vice President Biden positioned himself as an elder statesman ready to lead in moments of crisis that demanded strong executive experience. While his campaign lacked the policy luster that drew so many to Sanders, Biden was able to contrast himself starkly against the left-leaning platforms of Senators Sanders and [[Elizabeth Warren|Warren]] by promising to protect the Affordable Care Act against progressive efforts to further expand and nationalize it. This choice between the nostalgia and stability of more centrist Obama era policies, perceived by many as less of a liability against President Trump in November, and the high-risk, high-reward uncertainty of a far bolder, historically progressive vision became the defining narrative of the primary season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erickson |first1=Bo |title=Joe Biden prevails in nomination fight with electability argument |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-nomination-electability/ |website=CBS News |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> Ultimately, despite Joe Biden winning the most votes and delegates throughout the primary, polls showed that [[Bernie Sanders|Sanders]]'s progressive platform had more popular support than any other. Likely due to the threat of a second Trump term, though, voters were not willing to take the perceived risk of voting it into effect just yet due to the higher premium placed on simply winning the General Election. This led Senator Sanders to proudly declare that he had \"won the ideological war,\" as well as the \"generational debate,\" in reference to his enduring ideas and sustained strong support from younger voters.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lutz |first1=Eric |title=BERNIE SANDERS DECLARES IDEOLOGICAL VICTORY AS HE DROPS OUT OF 2020 RACE |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/bernie-sanders-declares-ideological-victory-as-he-drops-out-of-2020-race |website=Vanity Fair |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nDemographics-wise, Vice President Biden dominated with African Americans, suburban whites, voters over the age of 50, and newly-minted conservative Democrats who had joined the party after leaving the GOP in response to [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump]] and the stigma attached to his policies.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=Katelyn |title=Joe Biden\u2019s winning coalition: Black and suburban voters |url=https://www.vox.com/2020/3/4/21164494/joe-biden-coalition-black-suburban-voters |website=Vox |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> These former Republicans, and, to a lesser degree, elderly Black voters, are largely cited as the decisive demographics that tipped the scales in favor of Vice President Biden.

Among the other major candidates, Elizabeth Warren's base consisted primarily of middle-aged, highly-educated white voters in coastal regions; [[Michael Bloomberg]] scooped up some votes on Super Tuesday within demographics similar to Joe Biden's (sans the strength with African Americans); [[Pete Buttigieg]] performed well in the first few primaries with moderate liberals and wealthier white voters, however, his campaign was doomed by a lack of appeal to minorities; and [[Amy Klobuchar]] proved to have relatively strong, albeit very limiting, Midwestern regional appeal.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Democratic National Convention]]\n* [[List of Democratic National Conventions]]\n\n; United States politics:\n* [[American election campaigns in the 19th century]]\n* [[History of the United States Republican Party]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Secondary sources ===\n* ''American National Biography'' (20 volumes, 1999) covers all politicians no longer alive; online and paper copies at many academic libraries.

Parts of the area were protected as the '''Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve''' ('''SNNR'''), also called the '''Three Rivers Nature Reserve'''. The reserve consisted of 18 subareas, and each contained three zones which were managed with differing degrees of strictness. In 2015, the Chinese government decided to implement a new national park system, and created Sanjiangyuan National Park (SNP), which is set to open officially in 2020<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Yan |title=China\u2019s first national park, an experiment in living with snow leopards |url=https://news.mongabay.com/2017/05/chinas-first-national-park-an-experiment-in-living-with-snow-leopards/ |website=Mongabay |accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>.\n\nAlong with wetland and waters protection, other ecological values, such as grassland, forest, and wildlife enhancement, have also been presented as goals. To advance the goals of the SNNR uncontrolled or poorly managed mining, logging, hunting, and grazing have been curtailed. Foreign and other mining firms have replaced the uncontrolled miners, trees have been planted, and measures have been taken to protect endangered species. To protect the grasslands, pastoralists are not permitted to graze their animals in designated \u2018core zones\u2019 (see below), and grazing is supervised elsewhere in the SNNR. In addition, residents have been resettled from core zones and other grassland areas of the SNNR, and rangeland has been fenced and is in the process of being privatized throughout the Sanjiangyuan Area.<ref name=\"PP\">[http://www.plateauperspectives.org/ Plateau Perspectives]</ref>\n\n== Sanjiangyuan Area ==\n\nThe Sanjiangyuan Area covers the southern and eastern parts of Qinghai and has an area of about 363,000 km<sup>2</sup>, 50.4% of Qinghai. Included in it wholly or partially are 18 counties of the four Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures Yushu, Guoluo, Hainan, and Haungnan, and Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The Sanjiangyuan Area\u2019s population is about 600,000, 90% of which are Tibetan. 70% of the Sanjiangyuan Area\u2019s population are considered to be \u2018impoverished\u2019, with the average income of about 2000 RMB (roughly $300) per person/year. Since animal husbandry is the primary source of income, and many people are nomadic, this figure does not reflect the actual standard of living in a largely non-cash economy. The Sanjiangyuan Area in general has no special legal status, and the term is used to  indicate the region in which the three rivers arise, and the SNP exists.\n\nThe Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve (SNNR) was a subarea of the Sanjiangyuan Area which covered an area of about 152,300 km<sup>2</sup>, 21% of Qinghai, 42% of the Sanjiangyuan Area. It was larger than England and Wales combined. About 200,000 people traditionally live within the area that was covered by the SNNR. Resettlement efforts were made to resettle all nomads in Qinghai by 2011, but it is unclear as to the outcome of those efforts<ref>Goodman, D. (2004), \"Qinghai and the Emergence of the West: Nationalities, Communal Interaction, and National Integration\", The China Quarterly, Vol. 178, Cambridge University Press</ref>. The [[State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China|State Forestry Administration]] and the Qinghai government legally established the SNNR in May 2000. Its Management Bureau was founded September 2001, and the SNNR obtained State-level (national) status January 2003. The Management Bureau is in [[Xining]], and is under the Qinghai Forest Bureau. Mr. Wang Zhibao, Director of the State Forest Administration, has said the goals of the nature reserve protect the [[Qinghai-Tibet Plateau]] ecosystem, with a focus on alpine swamp meadow and the natural habitat of wildlife in the Sanjiangyuan Area.\n\nThe SNNR consisted of 18 subareas. These are of three types: wetland conservation (8 subareas), wildlife conservation (3 subareas), and shrubland or forest conservation (7 subareas). Each SNNR subarea had three zones: a core zone; a buffer zone; and a multiple-use experimental zone. Residents from degraded areas are being resettled. The core zone was supposed to be strictly managed with no grazing and measures to protect endangered species. All development and use were prohibited. It was a \u2018no man\u2019s zone\u2019, with all its residents resettled elsewhere.The buffer zone promoted conservation but allowed limited and rotational grazing. The multiple-use experimental zones were also be used for scientific investigations, eco-tourism, and other green industries.\n\nThe Sanjiangyuan National Park (SNP), as of 2019, consists of an area of 123,100 km<sup>2</sup>, which is only slightly smaller than England. It encompasses most of the southern half of Qinghai Province.\n\nThe predecessors to the zones on the SNNR map may be grazing zones which were part of the tuimu huancao, \u2018converting pastures to grasslands\u2019 program, which got its start in 2000. In this program there were three types of zones to address the problem of degraded pastures: zones in which grazing was permanently banned, zones in which grazing was to be banned for typically three to ten years, and zones which were seasonally closed to grazing or allowed seasonal rotational grazing. The implementation of four kinds of zones in Yushu and Guoluo prefectures also seem to provide a precedent, if these are not the SNNR map\u2019s zones themselves described differently. The first two of these zones correspond to what is referred to on the SNNR map as the \u2018core zone\u2019, the third to the \u2018buffer zone\u2019, and the fourth to the \u2018experimental zone\u2019. In the third (i.e. buffer) zone there was to be a reduction in grazing or a ban on grazing for five or ten years, and in the fourth (i.e. experimental) zone there was to be rotational grazing to capacity.<ref>Yeh, E.T. (2005), \"Green Governmentality and Pastoralism in Western China: Converting Pastures to Grasslands\", Nomadic Peoples, Vol. 9, Issues 1&2.</ref>\n\nSince the government also has a poverty reduction and a major project (e.g. dams) resettlement program, and plans to resettle all nomads by 2011, residents from the buffer and the experimental zones may be resettled under these programs rather than the ecological resettlement program.\n\nThe absolute and relative sizes, and the populations before resettlement, of the zones are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! !! Core !!Buffer !! Experimental\n|-\n| Area\n| 31,218 km<sup>2</sup>\t\t\t\t\n| 39,242 km<sup>2</sup>\n| 81,882 km<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n| % Total\n| 20.5%\n| 25.8%\t\n| 53.7%\n|-\n| Population\n| 40,000+\n| 50,000+\n| 120,000\n|}\n\nThe boundaries and characters of the zones are likely open to negotiation. For example, the Canadian mining company Inter-Citic\u2019s Dachang gold prospect is in either a buffer or experimental zone (or both).\n\nIn addition, only the 3 functional subareas of the SNNR, those with protection stations, have definite boundaries. The other 15 subareas are more a plan for their final delineation. The three functional subareas are [[Amne Machin|A'nimaqin]], Suojia-Qumahe (2 stations, one in each Qumahe and Suojia), and [[Tongtian River|Tongtian He]].\n\n== Townships affected ==\n\nThe SNNR is entirely in Qinghai.

In the third (i.e. buffer) zone there was to be a reduction in grazing or a ban on grazing for five or ten years, and in the fourth (i.e. experimental) zone there was to be rotational grazing to capacity.<ref>Yeh, E.T. (2005), \"Green Governmentality and Pastoralism in Western China: Converting Pastures to Grasslands\", Nomadic Peoples, Vol. 9, Issues 1&2.</ref>\n\nSince the government also has a poverty reduction and a major project (e.g. dams) resettlement program, and plans to resettle all nomads by 2011, residents from the buffer and the experimental zones may be resettled under these programs rather than the ecological resettlement program.\n\nThe absolute and relative sizes, and the populations before resettlement, of the zones are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! !! Core !!Buffer !! Experimental\n|-\n| Area\n| 31,218 km<sup>2</sup>\t\t\t\t\n| 39,242 km<sup>2</sup>\n| 81,882 km<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n| % Total\n| 20.5%\n| 25.8%\t\n| 53.7%\n|-\n| Population\n| 40,000+\n| 50,000+\n| 120,000\n|}\n\nThe boundaries and characters of the zones are likely open to negotiation. For example, the Canadian mining company Inter-Citic\u2019s Dachang gold prospect is in either a buffer or experimental zone (or both).\n\nIn addition, only the 3 functional subareas of the SNNR, those with protection stations, have definite boundaries. The other 15 subareas are more a plan for their final delineation. The three functional subareas are [[Amne Machin|A'nimaqin]], Suojia-Qumahe (2 stations, one in each Qumahe and Suojia), and [[Tongtian River|Tongtian He]].\n\n== Townships affected ==\n\nThe SNNR is entirely in Qinghai.

At the same time, however, it has been responsible for several deadly floods, including the only natural disasters in recorded history to have killed more than a million people. Among the deadliest were the [[1344 Yellow River flood|1332\u201333 flood]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]], the [[1887 Yellow River flood|1887 flood]] during the [[Qing dynasty]] which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a [[Republic of China era]] 1931 flood (part of [[1931 China floods|a massive number of floods that year]]) that killed 1\u20134 million people.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|last=White|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew White (atrocitologist)|publisher=[[W.

The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams were unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water has to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the [[path of least resistance]].  When this happens, it bursts out across the flat [[North China Plain]], sometimes taking a new channel and inundating any farmland, cities or towns in its path. The traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher [[levee]]s along the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as {{convert|480|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}}, sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of [[Shandong]] Peninsula and sometimes to the south.<ref name=\"Gascoigne\">Gascoigne, Bamber and Gascoigne, Christina (2003) ''The Dynasties of China'', Perseus Books Group, {{ISBN|0786712198}}</ref>\n\nAnother historical source of devastating floods is the collapse of upstream [[Ice jam|ice dam]]s in [[Inner Mongolia]] with an accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.<ref>[http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htpeace/articles/20110329.aspx The Ice Bombers Move Against Mongolia]. strategypage.com (29 March 2011)</ref>\n\nBefore modern [[dam]]s came to China, the Yellow River used to be extremely prone to flooding. In the 2,540 years from 595 BC to 1946 AD, the Yellow River has been reckoned to have flooded 1,593 times, shifting its course 26 times noticeably and nine times severely.<ref name=\"Treg\">Tregear, T.

The source tributaries drain into [[Gyaring Lake]] and [[Ngoring Lake]] on the western edge of [[Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Golog Prefecture]] high in the Bayan Har Mountains of [[Qinghai]]. In the Zoige Basin along the boundary with [[Gansu]], the Yellow River loops northwest and then northeast before turning south, creating the \"[[Ordos Loop]]\", and then flows generally eastward across the [[North China Plain]] to the [[Bohai Sea|Gulf of Bohai]], draining a [[drainage basin|basin]] of {{convert|752443|km\u00b2|sp=us|0}} which nourishes 140 million people with drinking water and irrigation.<ref name=\"video.nytimes.com\"/>\n\nThe Yellow River passes through seven present-day [[Province (China)|provinces]] and two [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], namely (from west to east) [[Qinghai]], Gansu, [[Ningxia]], Inner Mongolia, [[Shaanxi]], Shanxi, [[Henan]], and [[Shandong]]. Major cities along the present course of the Yellow River include (from west to east) [[Lanzhou]], [[Yinchuan]], [[Wuhai]], [[Baotou]], [[Luoyang]], [[Zhengzhou]], [[Kaifeng]], and [[Jinan]]. The current mouth of the Yellow River is located at [[Kenli County]], Shandong.\n\nThe river is commonly divided into three stages. These are roughly the northeast of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], the [[Ordos Loop]], and the [[North China Plain]].<ref name=\"Fishes_YR2015\"/> However, different scholars have different opinions on how the three stages are divided.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} This article mainly adopts the division used by the [[Yellow River Conservancy Commission]].<ref>[http://www.yellowriver.gov.cn/ Yellow River Conservancy Commission]. Yellowriver.gov.cn. Retrieved on 2013-02-04.</ref>\n\n===Upper reaches===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\n[[File:Yellow river - A. Holdrinet.jpg|thumb|Near [[Xunhua]], [[Qinghai]].]]\n[[File:VM 6056 Liujiaxia Town.jpg|thumb|[[Liujiaxia]], [[Gansu]].]]\n\nThe upper reaches of the Yellow River constitute a segment starting from its source in the Bayan Har Mountains and ending at Hekou Town ([[Togtoh County]]), [[Inner Mongolia]] just before it turns sharply to the south. This segment has a total length of {{convert|3472|km|0|sp=us}} and total basin area of {{convert|386000|km\u00b2|sp=us|sigfig=3}}, 51.4% of the total basin area. Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops {{convert|3496|m|0|sp=us}}, with an average [[Grade (slope)|grade]] of 0.10%.\n\nThe source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the [[Bayan Har Mountains]], and the Anemaqen ([[Amne Machin]]) Mountains in [[Qinghai]]. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes are characteristic of this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Gyaring (Zhaling) and Lake Ngoring (Eling), with capacities of 4.7&nbsp;billion and 10.8&nbsp;billion m\u00b3 (166 and 381 billion ft<sup>3</sup>), respectively. At elevations over {{convert|4290|m|sigfig=4|sp=us|abbr=on}}) above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide.  A significant amount of land in the Yellow River's source area has been designated as the [[Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve|Sanjiangyuan (\"'Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve]], to protect the source region of the Yellow River, the [[Yangtze]], and the [[Lancang (Mekong)]].\n\nFlowing east at the eastern edge of the Amne Machin Mountains, the Yellow River enters [[Maqu County]] in [[Gansu]].  Here, the river skirts through the high-altitude peat bog known as the [[Zoig\u00ea Marsh|Zoig\u00ea Wetlands]] and makes a sharp turn towards the northwest forming the border between Maqu and [[Zoig\u00ea County]] in [[Sichuan]].  Flowing now along the northern edge of Amne Machin, the river reenters Qinghai and gradually curves north towards the Longyang Gorge at [[Xinghai County|Xinghai]].\n\nThe valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the river. The water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, so the flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the most famous of these being the [[Longyang]], Jishi, [[Liujiaxia Dam|Liujia]], Bapan, and [[Qingtong]] gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plants.  The Yellow River exits Qinghai for the second and final time in these gorges and enters Gansu for the second time just before Liujia Gorge.  Downstream from the Yanguo Gorge, the provincial capital of [[Lanzhou]] is built upon the Yellow River's banks.  The Yellow River flows northeasterly out of Gansu and into [[Ningxia]] before the Qingtong Gorge.\n\nAfter emerging from the Qingtong Gorge, the river comes into a section of vast [[alluvial plain]]s, the [[Yinchuan Plain]] and [[Hetao Plain]]. In this section, the regions along the river are mostly [[deserts]] and [[grasslands]], with very few tributaries. The flow is slow. The Hetao Plain has a length of {{convert|900|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}} and width of {{convert|30|to|50|km|mi|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}. It is historically the most important irrigation plain along the Yellow River.\n\n===Middle reaches===\n{{main|Ordos Loop}}\n[[File:Landzhou 07-2005.jpg|right|thumb|At [[Lanzhou]], [[Gansu]]]]\n[[File:Shapotou.jpg|thumb|At [[Shapotou]], [[Ningxia]]]]\n[[File:Qiankun Bend.jpg|thumb|Qiankun bend in [[Yonghe County]]]]\n[[File:Luoyang-most.przez.rzeke.LuoHe.przed.ujsciem.do.HuangHe.jpg|thumb|At [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]]]]\nThe [[Ordos Loop]] formed by an enormous twist of the Yellow River, beginning at [[Zhongning County]] in [[Ningxia]] and ending with a drastic eastward turn at its confluence with the [[Wei River|Wei]] at [[Tongguan County|Tongguan]] in [[Shaanxi]]. However, the official division for the middle reaches of the river run from [[Hekou, Togtoh County|Hekou]] in [[Togtoh County]], [[Inner Mongolia]], to [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]]. The middle reaches are {{convert|1206|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} long, with a basin area of {{convert|344000|km\u00b2|sp=us|sigfig=3}}, 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of {{convert|890|m|sigfig=3|sp=us|abbr=on}}, an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts.\n\nThe middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the [[Loess Plateau]], where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most [[sediment]]-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91&nbsp;billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3 (57.4&nbsp;lb/ft<sup>3</sup>). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the [[river bed]] and creating the famous \"river above ground\". From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous [[Hukou Waterfall]] is in the lower part of this valley on the border of [[Shanxi]] and [[Shaanxi]].\n\n===Lower reaches===\nIn the lower reaches, from [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]] to its mouth, a distance of {{convert|786|km|sp=us|abbr=on}}, the river is confined to a [[levee]]-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the [[North China Plain]] before emptying into the [[Gulf of Bohai|Bohai Sea]]. The basin area in this stage is only {{convert|23000|km\u00b2|sp=us}}, a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the [[Huai River]], whereas those to the north drain into the [[Hai River]]. The Huai River Basin, for example, is separated from the Yellow River Basin by the south dike of the Yellow River.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yang |first1=Gonghuan |last2=Zhuang |first2=Dafang |title=Atlas of the Huai River Basin Water Environment: Digestive Cancer Mortality |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789401786195 |page=143}}</ref> The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is {{convert|93.6|m|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}, with an average grade of 0.012%.\n\nThe silts received from the middle reaches form sediments here, elevating the river bed. Excessive sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters above the surrounding ground. At [[Kaifeng]], Henan, the Yellow River is {{convert|10|m|sp=us|0}} above the ground level.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214151633/http://emw21.com/CTS/GeorgeLeung/YRiver/geofo/geogren.html |author=Leung, George |title=Reclamation and Sediment Control in the Middle Yellow River Valley |journal=Water International |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=12\u201319 |year=1996 |doi=10.1080/02508069608686482}}</ref>\n\n===Tributaries===\n[[File:5922-Daxia-River-fall-into-Liujiaxia-Reservoir.jpg|thumb|The mouth of the [[Daxia River]] (coming from bottom right), flowing into the Yellow River's [[Liujiaxia Reservoir]] in [[Linxia Prefecture]], [[Gansu]]]]\nTributaries of the Yellow River listed from its source to its mouth include:\n*[[White River (China)|White River]] \n*[[Ejin River|Black River]] \n*[[Huangshui River|Huang Shui]] \n**[[Datong River]] \n*[[Daxia River]] \n*[[Tao River]] \n*[[Zuli River]] \n*[[Qingshuihe River|Qingshui River]]\n*[[Dahei River]] \n*[[Kuye River]] \n*[[Wuding River]] \n*[[Fen River]] \n*[[Wei River]] (the Wei River is the largest of these tributaries)\n*[[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] \n*[[Qin River]] \n*[[Dawen River]] \n*[[Kuo River]]\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2009}}\n[[File:Yellow River Delta Animation.gif|thumb|Expansion of the Yellow River Delta from 1989 to 2009 in five year intervals.]]\n\nThe Yellow River is notable for the large amount of [[silt]] it carries\u20141.6 billion tons annually at the point where it descends from the [[Loess Plateau]]. If it is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea per year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} One estimate gives 34 kilograms of silt per cubic meter as opposed to 10 for the [[Colorado River|Colorado]] and 1 for the [[Nile]].<ref name=\"Treg\"/>\n\nIts average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural [[irrigation]], increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 (48,572&nbsp;mi\u00b2) of land.<ref name=\"video.nytimes.com\">[https://www.nytimes.com/video/2007/05/30/world/asia/1194817118362/chinas-yellow-river-part-1.html China's Yellow River, Part 1].

Maximum demand for irrigation is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation, several dams have been built, but their expected life is limited due to the high silt load. A proposed [[South\u2013North Water Transfer Project]] involves several schemes to divert water from the [[Yangtze River]]: one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], and a third using the route of the old [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nDue to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a [[Deposition (geology)|depositing]] stream{{spaced ndash}}that is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between [[levee|natural levee]]s in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur, the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and take\na new channel. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years.

At the same time, however, it has been responsible for several deadly floods, including the only natural disasters in recorded history to have killed more than a million people. Among the deadliest were the [[1344 Yellow River flood|1332\u201333 flood]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]], the [[1887 Yellow River flood|1887 flood]] during the [[Qing dynasty]] which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a [[Republic of China era]] 1931 flood (part of [[1931 China floods|a massive number of floods that year]]) that killed 1\u20134 million people.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|last=White|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew White (atrocitologist)|publisher=[[W.

The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams were unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water has to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the [[path of least resistance]].  When this happens, it bursts out across the flat [[North China Plain]], sometimes taking a new channel and inundating any farmland, cities or towns in its path. The traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher [[levee]]s along the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as {{convert|480|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}}, sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of [[Shandong]] Peninsula and sometimes to the south.<ref name=\"Gascoigne\">Gascoigne, Bamber and Gascoigne, Christina (2003) ''The Dynasties of China'', Perseus Books Group, {{ISBN|0786712198}}</ref>\n\nAnother historical source of devastating floods is the collapse of upstream [[Ice jam|ice dam]]s in [[Inner Mongolia]] with an accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.<ref>[http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htpeace/articles/20110329.aspx The Ice Bombers Move Against Mongolia]. strategypage.com (29 March 2011)</ref>\n\nBefore modern [[dam]]s came to China, the Yellow River used to be extremely prone to flooding.

The goal of the operation was to stop the advancing Japanese troops by following a strategy of  \"using water as a substitute for soldiers\" (''yishui daibing''). The [[1938 Yellow River flood|1938 flood]] of an area covering {{convert|54000|km\u00b2|sigfig=3|sp=us|abbr=on}} took some 500,000 to 900,000 Chinese lives, along with an unknown number of Japanese soldiers.

The source tributaries drain into [[Gyaring Lake]] and [[Ngoring Lake]] on the western edge of [[Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Golog Prefecture]] high in the Bayan Har Mountains of [[Qinghai]]. In the Zoige Basin along the boundary with [[Gansu]], the Yellow River loops northwest and then northeast before turning south, creating the \"[[Ordos Loop]]\", and then flows generally eastward across the [[North China Plain]] to the [[Bohai Sea|Gulf of Bohai]], draining a [[drainage basin|basin]] of {{convert|752443|km\u00b2|sp=us|0}} which nourishes 140 million people with drinking water and irrigation.<ref name=\"video.nytimes.com\"/>\n\nThe Yellow River passes through seven present-day [[Province (China)|provinces]] and two [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], namely (from west to east) [[Qinghai]], Gansu, [[Ningxia]], Inner Mongolia, [[Shaanxi]], Shanxi, [[Henan]], and [[Shandong]]. Major cities along the present course of the Yellow River include (from west to east) [[Lanzhou]], [[Yinchuan]], [[Wuhai]], [[Baotou]], [[Luoyang]], [[Zhengzhou]], [[Kaifeng]], and [[Jinan]]. The current mouth of the Yellow River is located at [[Kenli County]], Shandong.\n\nThe river is commonly divided into three stages. These are roughly the northeast of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], the [[Ordos Loop]], and the [[North China Plain]].<ref name=\"Fishes_YR2015\"/> However, different scholars have different opinions on how the three stages are divided.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} This article mainly adopts the division used by the [[Yellow River Conservancy Commission]].<ref>[http://www.yellowriver.gov.cn/ Yellow River Conservancy Commission].

Holdrinet.jpg|thumb|Near [[Xunhua]], [[Qinghai]].]]\n[[File:VM 6056 Liujiaxia Town.jpg|thumb|[[Liujiaxia]], [[Gansu]].]]\n\nThe upper reaches of the Yellow River constitute a segment starting from its source in the Bayan Har Mountains and ending at Hekou Town ([[Togtoh County]]), [[Inner Mongolia]] just before it turns sharply to the south. This segment has a total length of {{convert|3472|km|0|sp=us}} and total basin area of {{convert|386000|km\u00b2|sp=us|sigfig=3}}, 51.4% of the total basin area. Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops {{convert|3496|m|0|sp=us}}, with an average [[Grade (slope)|grade]] of 0.10%.\n\nThe source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the [[Bayan Har Mountains]], and the Anemaqen ([[Amne Machin]]) Mountains in [[Qinghai]]. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes are characteristic of this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Gyaring (Zhaling) and Lake Ngoring (Eling), with capacities of 4.7&nbsp;billion and 10.8&nbsp;billion m\u00b3 (166 and 381 billion ft<sup>3</sup>), respectively. At elevations over {{convert|4290|m|sigfig=4|sp=us|abbr=on}}) above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide.  A significant amount of land in the Yellow River's source area has been designated as the [[Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve|Sanjiangyuan (\"'Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve]], to protect the source region of the Yellow River, the [[Yangtze]], and the [[Mekong]].\n\nFlowing east at the eastern edge of the Amne Machin Mountains, the Yellow River enters [[Maqu County]] in [[Gansu]].  Here, the river skirts through the high-altitude peat bog known as the [[Zoig\u00ea Marsh|Zoig\u00ea Wetlands]] and makes a sharp turn towards the northwest forming the border between Maqu and [[Zoig\u00ea County]] in [[Sichuan]].  Flowing now along the northern edge of Amne Machin, the river reenters Qinghai and gradually curves north towards the Longyang Gorge at [[Xinghai County|Xinghai]].\n\nThe valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the river. The water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, so the flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the most famous of these being the [[Longyang]], Jishi, [[Liujiaxia Dam|Liujia]], Bapan, and [[Qingtong]] gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plants.  The Yellow River exits Qinghai for the second and final time in these gorges and enters Gansu for the second time just before Liujia Gorge.  Downstream from the Yanguo Gorge, the provincial capital of [[Lanzhou]] is built upon the Yellow River's banks.  The Yellow River flows northeasterly out of Gansu and into [[Ningxia]] before the Qingtong Gorge.\n\nAfter emerging from the Qingtong Gorge, the river comes into a section of vast [[alluvial plain]]s, the [[Yinchuan Plain]] and [[Hetao Plain]]. In this section, the regions along the river are mostly [[deserts]] and [[grasslands]], with very few tributaries. The flow is slow. The Hetao Plain has a length of {{convert|900|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}} and width of {{convert|30|to|50|km|mi|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}. It is historically the most important irrigation plain along the Yellow River.\n\n===Middle reaches===\n{{main|Ordos Loop}}\n[[File:Landzhou 07-2005.jpg|right|thumb|At [[Lanzhou]], [[Gansu]]]]\n[[File:Shapotou.jpg|thumb|At [[Shapotou]], [[Ningxia]]]]\n[[File:Qiankun Bend.jpg|thumb|Qiankun bend in [[Yonghe County]]]]\n[[File:Luoyang-most.przez.rzeke.LuoHe.przed.ujsciem.do.HuangHe.jpg|thumb|At [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]]]]\nThe [[Ordos Loop]] formed by an enormous twist of the Yellow River, beginning at [[Zhongning County]] in [[Ningxia]] and ending with a drastic eastward turn at its confluence with the [[Wei River|Wei]] at [[Tongguan County|Tongguan]] in [[Shaanxi]]. However, the official division for the middle reaches of the river run from [[Hekou, Togtoh County|Hekou]] in [[Togtoh County]], [[Inner Mongolia]], to [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]]. The middle reaches are {{convert|1206|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} long, with a basin area of {{convert|344000|km\u00b2|sp=us|sigfig=3}}, 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of {{convert|890|m|sigfig=3|sp=us|abbr=on}}, an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts.\n\nThe middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the [[Loess Plateau]], where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most [[sediment]]-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91&nbsp;billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3 (57.4&nbsp;lb/ft<sup>3</sup>). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the [[river bed]] and creating the famous \"river above ground\". From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous [[Hukou Waterfall]] is in the lower part of this valley on the border of [[Shanxi]] and [[Shaanxi]].\n\n===Lower reaches===\nIn the lower reaches, from [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]] to its mouth, a distance of {{convert|786|km|sp=us|abbr=on}}, the river is confined to a [[levee]]-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the [[North China Plain]] before emptying into the [[Gulf of Bohai|Bohai Sea]]. The basin area in this stage is only {{convert|23000|km\u00b2|sp=us}}, a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the [[Huai River]], whereas those to the north drain into the [[Hai River]]. The Huai River Basin, for example, is separated from the Yellow River Basin by the south dike of the Yellow River.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yang |first1=Gonghuan |last2=Zhuang |first2=Dafang |title=Atlas of the Huai River Basin Water Environment: Digestive Cancer Mortality |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789401786195 |page=143}}</ref> The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is {{convert|93.6|m|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}, with an average grade of 0.012%.\n\nThe silts received from the middle reaches form sediments here, elevating the river bed. Excessive sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters above the surrounding ground. At [[Kaifeng]], Henan, the Yellow River is {{convert|10|m|sp=us|0}} above the ground level.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214151633/http://emw21.com/CTS/GeorgeLeung/YRiver/geofo/geogren.html |author=Leung, George |title=Reclamation and Sediment Control in the Middle Yellow River Valley |journal=Water International |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=12\u201319 |year=1996 |doi=10.1080/02508069608686482}}</ref>\n\n===Tributaries===\n[[File:5922-Daxia-River-fall-into-Liujiaxia-Reservoir.jpg|thumb|The mouth of the [[Daxia River]] (coming from bottom right), flowing into the Yellow River's [[Liujiaxia Reservoir]] in [[Linxia Prefecture]], [[Gansu]]]]\nTributaries of the Yellow River listed from its source to its mouth include:\n*[[White River (China)|White River]] \n*[[Ejin River|Black River]] \n*[[Huangshui River|Huang Shui]] \n**[[Datong River]] \n*[[Daxia River]] \n*[[Tao River]] \n*[[Zuli River]] \n*[[Qingshuihe River|Qingshui River]]\n*[[Dahei River]] \n*[[Kuye River]] \n*[[Wuding River]] \n*[[Fen River]] \n*[[Wei River]] (the Wei River is the largest of these tributaries)\n*[[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] \n*[[Qin River]] \n*[[Dawen River]] \n*[[Kuo River]]\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2009}}\n[[File:Yellow River Delta Animation.gif|thumb|Expansion of the Yellow River Delta from 1989 to 2009 in five year intervals.]]\n\nThe Yellow River is notable for the large amount of [[silt]] it carries\u20141.6 billion tons annually at the point where it descends from the [[Loess Plateau]]. If it is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea per year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} One estimate gives 34 kilograms of silt per cubic meter as opposed to 10 for the [[Colorado River|Colorado]] and 1 for the [[Nile]].<ref name=\"Treg\"/>\n\nIts average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural [[irrigation]], increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 (48,572&nbsp;mi\u00b2) of land.<ref name=\"video.nytimes.com\">[https://www.nytimes.com/video/2007/05/30/world/asia/1194817118362/chinas-yellow-river-part-1.html China's Yellow River, Part 1]. ''The New York Times'' (2007-05-30)</ref> The Yellow River delta totals 8,000 square kilometers (3,090&nbsp;mi\u00b2).

Maximum demand for irrigation is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation, several dams have been built, but their expected life is limited due to the high silt load. A proposed [[South\u2013North Water Transfer Project]] involves several schemes to divert water from the [[Yangtze River]]: one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], and a third using the route of the old [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nDue to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a [[Deposition (geology)|depositing]] stream{{spaced ndash}}that is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between [[levee|natural levee]]s in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur, the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and take\na new channel. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years. In modern times, considerable effort has been made to strengthen levees and control floods.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n==Hydroelectric power dams==\n[[File:6058-Liujiaxia-Dam.jpg|thumb|[[Liujiaxia Dam]], [[Gansu]]]]\n[[File:Smxgongcheng zengmian.jpg|thumb|[[Sanmenxia Dam]], [[Henan]]]]\nBelow is the list of [[hydroelectric]] power stations built on the Yellow River, arranged according to the first year of operation (in brackets):\n\n*[[Sanmenxia Dam]]  (1960; [[Sanmenxia]], Henan)\n*[[Sanshenggong Dam]] (1966)\n*[[Qingtong Gorge]] hydroelectric power station (1968; [[Qingtongxia]], Ningxia)\n*[[Liujiaxia Dam]] (Liujia Gorge) (1974; [[Yongjing County]], Gansu)\n*[[Lijiaxia Dam]] (1997) ([[Jainca County]], Qinghai)\n*[[Yanguoxia Dam]] (Yanguo Gorge) hydroelectric power station (1975; Yongjing County, Gansu)\n*[[Tianqiao Dam]] (1977)\n*[[Bapanxia Dam]] (Bapan Gorge) (1980; [[Xigu District]], [[Lanzhou]], Gansu)\n*[[Longyangxia Dam]]  (1992; [[Gonghe County]], Qinghai)\n*[[Da Gorge]] hydroelectric power station (1998)\n*[[Li Gorge]] hydroelectric power station (1999)\n*[[Wanjiazhai Dam]] (1999; [[Pianguan County]], Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia)\n*[[Xiaolangdi Dam]] (2001) ([[Jiyuan]], Henan)\n*[[Laxiwa Dam]] (2010) ([[Guide County]], Qinghai)\n*[[Yangqu Dam]] (2016) ([[Xinghai County]], Qinghai)\n*[[Maerdang Dam]] (2018) ([[Maq\u00ean County]], Qinghai)\n\nAs reported in 2000, the 7 largest hydro power plants (Longyangxia, Lijiaxia, Liujiaxia, Yanguoxia, Bapanxia, Daxia and Qinglongxia) had the total installed capacity of 5,618 MW.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/english/200012/14/eng20001214_57817.html Yellow River Upstream Important to West-East Power Transmission]  People's Daily, 14 December 2000</ref>\n\n==Crossings==\n[[File:Major cities along the Yellow River.svg|right|thumb|450px|Major cities along the Yellow River]]\n[[File:Yellow river pontoon bridge jinan 2008 05.jpg|thumb|[[Pontoon bridge]] (Luokou Pontoon Bridge {{zh\n|s={{linktext|\u6d1b\u53e3\u6d6e\u6865}}\n|t=\u6d1b\u53e3\u6d6e\u6a4b\n|p=Lu\u00f2k\u014fu F\u00faqi\u00e1o}}) over the Yellow River in [[Jinan]], [[Shandong]]]]\nThe main bridges and ferries by the province names in the order of downstream to upstream are:{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Shandong]]\n* [[Dongying Yellow River Bridge]]\n* [[Shengli Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Dongying]])\n* [[Lijin Yellow River Bridge]] (Dongying)\n* [[Binzhou Yellow River Road-Railway Bridge]]\n* [[Binzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge]]\n* [[Binzhou\u2013Laiwu Expressway Binzhou Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Binzhou]]\u2013[[Zibo]])\n* [[Huiqing Yellow River Bridge]] (Binzhou\u2013Zibo)\n* [[Jiyang Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Jinan]])\n* [[G20 Qingdao\u2013Yinchuan Expressway Jinan Yellow River Bridge]] (Jinan)\n* [[Jinan Yellow River Bridge]]\n* [[Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge]] (Jinan)\n* [[Jinan Jianbang Yellow River Bridge]]\n* [[Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-speed Railway Jinan Yellow River Bridge]] (Jinan\u2013[[Dezhou]])\n* [[Beijing\u2013Taipei Expressway Jinan Yellow River Bridge]] (Jinan\u2013Dezhou)\n* [[Beijing\u2013Shanghai Railway Jinan Yellow River New Bridge]] (Jinan\u2013Dezhou)\n* [[Pingyin Yellow River Bridge]] (Jinan-[[Liaocheng]])\n\nShandong\u2013[[Henan]]\n* [[Beijing\u2013Kowloon Railway Sunkou Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Jining]]\u2013[[Puyang]])\n* [[Juancheng Yellow River Highway Bridge]] ([[Heze]]\u2013Puyang)\n* [[Dongming Yellow River Highway Bridge]] (Heze\u2013Puyang)\n\nHenan\n* [[Kaifeng Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Kaifeng]])\n* [[Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Zhengzhou]])\n\n[[Shanxi]]\u2013Henan\n* [[Sanmen Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Sanmenxia]])\n\n[[Shaanxi]]\u2013Henan\n* [[Hancheng Yumenkou Yellow River Bridge]]\n\n[[Ningxia]]\n* [[Yinchuan Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Yinchuan]])\n\n[[Inner Mongolia]]\n* [[Baotou Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Baotou]])\n\n[[Gansu]]\n* [[Lanzhou Yellow River Bridge]]\n* [[Zhongshan Bridge]] ([[Lanzhou]])\n\n[[Qinghai]]\n* [[Dari Yellow River Bridge]]\n<!--* Zalinghu crossing-->\n\n==Fauna==\n===Fish===\n[[File:DV Paradise fish male 03.jpg|thumb|The [[paradise fish]] is well-known in the aquarium hobby and it originates from East Asian river basins, including the Yellow River]]\n\nThe Yellow River basin is rich in fish, being the home of more than 160 native species in 92 [[genera]] and 28 [[Family (biology)|families]], including 19 species found nowhere else in the world ([[Endemism|endemic]]).<ref name=Xie2018>{{cite journal | author1=Xie, J.Y. | author2=W.J.
