In competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank the competitors based on criteria such as symmetry, muscularity, size, conditioning, posing, and stage presentation. Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of [[Adipose tissue|nonessential body fat]], enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular [[dehydration]] and [[carbohydrate loading]], to achieve maximum muscular definition and [[vascularity]], as well as [[Sun tanning|tanning]] to accentuate the contrast of the skin under the spotlights. Some bodybuilders use [[anabolic steroid]]s and other [[performance-enhancing drug]]s to build muscles; however, competitions usually ban using them because of the health risks or considerations regarding fair competition.\n<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: Please do not add yourself or other bodybuilders you perceive to be notable.

He allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in \"muscle display performances\". Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]. The [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning 1936 [[musical film]] ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' depicts the beginning of modern bodybuilding, when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nSandow was so successful at flexing and posing his physique that he later created several businesses around his fame, and was among the first to market products branded with his name. He was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise equipment for the masses: machined [[dumbbell]]s, spring [[pulley]]s, and tension bands. Even his image was sold by the thousands in \"[[cabinet card]]s\" and other prints. Sandow was a perfect \"Gracilian\", a standard of [[Golden ratio|ideal body proportion]]s close to those of ancient Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statues. Men's physiques were then judged by how closely they matched these proportions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n====First large-scale bodybuilding competition====\nSandow organized the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901, called the \"Great Competition\". It was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rhodes|first=Jesse|title=Bodybuilders Through the Ages|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Bodybuilders-Through-the-Ages.html|date=July 19, 2009}}</ref> Judged by Sandow, Sir Charles Lawes, and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], the contest was a great success and many bodybuilding enthusiasts were turned away due to the overwhelming amount of audience members. The trophy presented to the winner was a gold statue of Sandow sculpted by Frederick Pomeroy. The winner was William L. Murray of [[Nottingham]]. The silver Sandow trophy was presented to second-place winner D. Cooper. The bronze Sandow trophy \u2014 now the most famous of all \u2014 was presented to third-place winner A.C. Smythe.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In 1950, this same bronze trophy was presented to [[Steve Reeves]] for winning the inaugural [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|NABBA]] [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] contest.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} It would not resurface again until 1977 when the winner of the [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] [[Mr. Olympia]] contest, [[Frank Zane]], was presented with a replica of the bronze trophy.

Two weeks later, [[Thomas Edison]] made a film of Treloar's posing routine. Edison had also made two films of Sandow a few years before. Those were the first three motion pictures featuring a bodybuilder. In the early 20th century, Macfadden and [[Charles Atlas]] continued to promote bodybuilding across the world.\n\n==== Notable early bodybuilders ====\n[[File:Ed_Fury_and_Jackie_Coey,_1953.jpg|left|thumb|Model Jackie Coey with Mr. Los Angeles contestant [[Ed Fury]] in 1953]]\n\nMany other important bodybuilders in the early history of bodybuilding prior to 1930 include: Earle Liederman (writer of some of bodybuilding's earliest books), [[Zishe Breitbart]], [[Georg Hackenschmidt]], Emy Nkemena, George F.

The number of bodybuilding organizations grew, and most notably the [[International Federation of Bodybuilders]] (IFBB) was founded in 1946 by Canadian brothers [[Joe Weider|Joe]] and [[Ben Weider]]. Other bodybuilding organizations included the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU), [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|National Amateur Bodybuilding Association]] (NABBA), and the World Bodybuilding Guild (WBBG). Consequently, the contests grew both in number and in size. Besides the many \"Mr. XXX\" (insert town, city, state, or region) championships, the most prestigious titles{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were Mr. America, Mr. World, Mr. Universe, Mr. Galaxy, and ultimately Mr. Olympia, which was started in 1965 by the IFBB and is now considered the most important bodybuilding competition in the world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the 1950s, the most successful and most famous competing bodybuilders{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were [[Bill Pearl]], [[Reg Park]], [[Leroy Colbert]], and [[Clarence Ross]]. Certain bodybuilders rose to fame thanks to the relatively new medium of television, as well as cinema. The most notable{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were [[Jack LaLanne]], [[Steve Reeves]], Reg Park, and [[Mickey Hargitay]]. While there were well-known gyms throughout the country during the 1950s (such as Vince's Gym in [[North Hollywood, California]] and [[Vic Tanny]]'s chain gyms), there were still segments of the United States that had no \"hardcore\" bodybuilding gyms until the advent of [[Gold's Gym]] in the mid-1960s.  Finally, the famed [[Muscle Beach]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] continued its popularity as the place to be for witnessing acrobatic acts, feats of strength, and the like. The movement grew more in the 1960s with increased TV and movie exposure, as bodybuilders were [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in popular shows and movies.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===1970s{{ndash}}1990s===\n==== New organizations ====\nIn the 1970s, bodybuilding had major publicity thanks to the appearance of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Franco Columbu]], [[Lou Ferrigno]], and others in the 1977 [[docudrama]] ''[[Pumping Iron]]''. By this time, the IFBB dominated the competitive bodybuilding landscape and the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) took a back seat. The [[National Physique Committee]] (NPC) was formed in 1981 by [[Jim Manion]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifbbpro.com/features/jim-manion-chairman-ifbb-professional-league/|title=IFBB Professional League - Jim Manion, Chairman IFBB Professional League|publisher=Ifbbpro.com|date=September 26, 2007|accessdate=October 5, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921210350/http://abhivacrossfitarena.com/|archivedate=September 21, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> who had just stepped down as chairman of the AAU Physique Committee. The NPC has gone on to become the most successful bodybuilding organization in America and is the amateur division of the IFBB. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the decline of AAU-sponsored bodybuilding contests. In 1999, the AAU voted to discontinue its bodybuilding events.\n\n==== Anabolic/androgenic steroid use ====\n[[File:Ronnie_Coleman_8_x_Mr_Olympia_-_2009_-_7.png|right|thumb|[[Ronnie Coleman]], eight-time [[Mr. Olympia]], pictured in October 2009]]\n\nThis period also saw the rise of [[anabolic steroid]]s in bodybuilding and many other sports. In bodybuilding lore, this is partly attributed to the rise of \"mass monsters\", beginning with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Sergio Oliva]], and [[Lou Ferrigno]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and continuing through the 1980s with [[Lee Haney]], the 1990s with [[Dorian Yates]], [[Ronnie Coleman]], and [[Markus R\u00fchl]], and up to the present day. Bodybuilders such as [[Greg Kovacs]] attained mass and size never seen previously but were not successful at the pro level. Others were renowned for their spectacular development of a particular body part, like [[Tom Platz]] or [[Paul Demayo]] for their leg muscles. At the time of shooting ''Pumping Iron'', Schwarzenegger (while never admitting to steroid use until long after his retirement) said that \"you have to do anything you can to get the advantage in competition\".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} He would later say that he does not regret using anything.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-676684.html|newspaper=CBS|date=February 11, 2009|title=Arnold: No Regrets About Steroids|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo combat anabolic steroid use and in the hopes of becoming a member of the [[IOC]], the IFBB introduced [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] tests for both steroids and other banned substances. Although doping tests occurred, the majority of professional bodybuilders still used anabolic steroids for competition. During the 1970s, the use of anabolic steroids was openly discussed, partly due to the fact they were legal.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Theunissen|first=Steve|title=Arnold & Steroids: Truth Revealed|url=http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008172601/http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm|archivedate=October 8, 2003|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990, [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] placed anabolic steroids into Schedule III of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA).

McMahon wanted to bring [[WWE|WWF]]-style showmanship and bigger prize money to the sport of bodybuilding. A number of IFBB stars were recruited but the roster was never very large and featured the same athletes competing; the most notable winner and first WBF champion was [[Gary Strydom]]. McMahon formally dissolved the WBF in July 1992. Reasons for this reportedly included lack of income from the pay-per-view broadcasts of the contests, slow sales of the WBF's magazine ''Bodybuilding Lifestyles'' (later ''WBF Magazine''), and the expense of paying multiple six-figure contracts while producing two TV shows and a monthly magazine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, [[Joe Weider]] sold Weider Publications to [[American Media (publisher)|AMI]], which owns the ''[[National Enquirer]]''. The position of president of the IFBB was filled by Rafael Santonja following the death of [[Ben Weider]] in October 2008. In 2004, contest promoter Wayne DeMilia broke ranks with the IFBB and AMI took over the promotion of the Mr. Olympia contest: in 2017 AMI took the contest outright.<ref>American Media Inc., \"American Media, Inc. Acquires Full Ownership Of Mr. Olympia Competition\" (5 Sept. 2017): https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-media-inc-acquires-full-ownership-of-mr-olympia-competition-300513901.html</ref>\n\nIn the early 21st century, patterns of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[recreation]] similar to those of the United States became more widespread in Europe and especially in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. This resulted in the emergence of whole new populations of bodybuilders from former [[Eastern Bloc]] states.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Olympic sport discussion ====\nIn the early 2000s, the IFBB was attempting to make bodybuilding an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport. It obtained full IOC membership in 2000 and was attempting to get approved as a demonstration event at the Olympics, which would hopefully lead to it being added as a full contest. This did not happen and Olympic recognition for bodybuilding remains controversial since many argue that bodybuilding is not a sport.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Littman|first=Jean|title=Bodybuilding And The Olympics: An Ongoing Controversy|publisher=article99.com|url=http://www.article99.com/recreation-and-sports/olympics/article.php?art=63758|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205174022/http://www.article99.com/recreation-and-sports/olympics/article.php?art=63758|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 5, 2007|date=November 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Areas ==\n=== Professional bodybuilding ===\n{{Main|Professional bodybuilding}}\n[[File:Frank_Zane.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Zane]], three-time Mr. Olympia]]\nIn the modern bodybuilding industry, the term \"[[Professional bodybuilding|professional]]\" generally means a bodybuilder who has won qualifying competitions as an amateur and has earned a \"pro card\" from their respective organization. Professionals earn the right to compete in competitions that include monetary prizes. A pro card also prohibits the athlete from competing in federations other than the one from which they have received the pro card.<ref>[http://www.ifbb.com/ifbb-faq/ Ifbb Faq \u2013 Ifbb]. Ifbb.com (February 22, 1999). Retrieved on 2016-11-29.</ref> Depending on the level of success, these bodybuilders may receive monetary compensation from sponsors, much like athletes in other sports.\n\n===Natural bodybuilding {{anchor|MuscleMania|UFE|INBF|WNBF|INBA|PNBA|NPC|NANBF}}===\n{{Main|Natural bodybuilding}}\nDue to the growing concerns of the high cost, health consequences, and illegal nature of some steroids, many organizations have formed in response and have deemed themselves \"natural\" bodybuilding competitions. In addition to the concerns noted, many promoters of bodybuilding have sought to shed the \"freakish\" perception that the general public has of bodybuilding and have successfully introduced a more mainstream audience to the sport of bodybuilding by including competitors whose physiques appear much more attainable and realistic.<ref name=\"natural\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/beginner_natural_bodybuilding_guide.htm|title=Beginner's Guide To Natural Bodybuilding Competition: Disseminating Misconception From Reality!|website=Bodybuilding.com|accessdate=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\nIn natural contests, the testing protocol ranges among organizations from [[Polygraph test|lie detectors]] to [[urinalysis]]. Penalties also range from organization to organization from suspensions to strict bans from competition. It is also important to note that natural organizations also have their own list of banned substances and it is important to refer to each organization's website for more information about which substances are banned from competition. There are many natural bodybuilding organizations; some of the larger ones include: MuscleMania, Ultimate Fitness Events (UFE), INBF/WNBF, and INBA/PNBA. These organizations either have an American or worldwide presence and are not limited to the country in which they are headquartered.<ref name=\"natural\"/>\n\n=== Men's Physique ===\nDue to the number of people who found bodybuilding to be \"too big\" or \"ugly\" and unhealthy, a new category was started in 2013. The first MR. Olympia was Mark Wingson, which was followed by Jeremy Buendia for consecutive years. Like bodybuilding, the federations in which you can compete in are all the same, there is natural and regular as well but the main difference between the two is that men's physique pose in board shorts rather than a traditional posing suit. Bodybuilders are much larger than the men physique competitors as well as have an extensive routine when posing while the Physique category only gets judged by the front and back poses. Many of the competitors are not freakishly large and have a bit of a more attainable and aesthetic physique in comparison to bodybuilding. Although this category started off slow, it grew tremendously in the past 5 years, now Men's Physique seems to be the most popular class to be in.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Classic Physique ===\nThis is the middle ground of both Men's Physique and Bodybuilding. The competitors in this category are not nearly as big as bodybuilders but not as small as mens physique competitors. They pose and perform in mens boxer briefs to show off the legs, unlike Mens Physique which hide the legs in board shorts. Classic physique has only been around for 3 years now as it started in 2016. Danny Hester was the first Classic Physique Mr. Olympia and now Chris Bumstead is the 2019 Mr. Olympia. {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Female bodybuilding ===\n{{main|Female bodybuilding}}\n[[File:Nikki_Fuller.jpg|thumb|Pro female bodybuilder [[Nikki Fuller]] performing a side chest pose]]\nThe first U.S. Women's National Physique Championship, promoted by Henry McGhee and held in [[Canton, Ohio]] in 1978, is generally regarded as the first true female bodybuilding contest\u2014that is, the first contest where the entrants were judged solely on muscularity.<ref>Todd, Jan, \"Bodybuilding\", St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture, Gale Group, 1999</ref> In 1980, the first [[Ms. Olympia]] (initially known as the \"Miss\" Olympia), the most prestigious contest for professionals, was held. The first winner was [[Rachel McLish]], who had also won the NPC's USA Championship earlier in the year. The contest was a major turning point for female bodybuilding. McLish inspired many future competitors to start training and competing. In 1985, a movie called ''[[Pumping Iron II: The Women]]'' was released. It documented the preparation of several women for the 1983 [[Caesars Palace]] World Cup Championship. Competitors prominently featured in the film were Kris Alexander, Lori Bowen, Lydia Cheng, Carla Dunlap, [[Bev Francis]], and McLish. At the time, Francis was actually a [[Powerlifting|powerlifter]], though she soon made a successful transition to bodybuilding, becoming one of the leading competitors of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nIn recent years, the related areas of [[fitness and figure competition]] have increased in popularity, surpassing that of female bodybuilding, and have provided an alternative for women who choose not to develop the level of muscularity necessary for bodybuilding. McLish would closely resemble what is thought of today as a fitness and figure competitor, instead of what is now considered a female bodybuilder. Fitness competitions also have a [[gymnastic]] element to them. A study by the ''[[Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine]]'' found that female bodybuilders who are taking [[anabolic steroid]]s are more likely to have qualified for [[Substance dependence|substance dependence disorder]], to have been diagnosed with a [[psychiatric illness]], or to have a history of [[sexual abuse]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Mitchell|title=Women and Anabolic Steroids: An Analysis of a Dozen Users|journal=Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine|date=Nov 2010|volume=20|issue=6|pages=475\u201381|pmid=21079445|doi=10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181fb5370}}</ref>\n\nE.

Bodybuilders usually spend a lot of time practising their posing in front of mirrors or under the guidance of their coach.\n\nIn contrast to [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] or [[powerlifting]] competitions, where [[physical strength]] is paramount, or to [[Olympic weightlifting]], where the main point is equally split between strength and technique, bodybuilding competitions typically emphasize condition, size, and symmetry. Different organizations emphasize particular aspects of competition, and sometimes have different categories in which to compete.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Preparations ===\n==== Bulking and cutting ====\nThe general strategy adopted by most present-day competitive bodybuilders is to make muscle gains for most of the year (known as the \"off-season\") and, approximately 12\u201314 weeks from competition, lose a maximum of [[Adipose tissue|body fat]] (referred to as \"cutting\") while preserving as much muscular mass as possible. The bulking phase entails remaining in a net positive energy balance ([[calorie]] surplus). The amount of a surplus in which a person remains is based on the person's goals, as a bigger surplus and longer bulking phase will create more fat tissue.

Some gain in fat mass is expected, which athletes seek to oxidize in a cutting period while maintaining as much lean mass as possible.\n\n==== Clean bulking ====\nMany non-competitive bodybuilders choose not to adopt this conventional strategy, as it often results in significant unwanted fat gain during the \"bulking\" phase. The attempt to increase muscle mass in one's body without any gain in fat is called clean bulking. Competitive bodybuilders focus their efforts to achieve a peak appearance during a brief \"competition season\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Clean bulking takes longer and is a more refined approach to achieving the body fat and muscle mass percentage a person is looking for. A common tactic for keeping fat low and muscle mass high would be to have higher calorie and lower calorie days to maintain a balance between gain and loss. Many clean bulk diets start off with a moderate amount of carbs, moderate amount of protein, and a decently low amount of fats. \"Gaining lean muscle means going for leaner cuts of meat, like flank steaks and fillets, chicken, and, of course, fish,\" says White{{Who|date=January 2019}}. \"Enjoy your meat with some starch: rice, beans, quinoa, whole-grain couscous, or sweet potato, for example\".<ref>Giblin, Chris. \"Clean Bulking: for Frustrated Hard-Gainers, Clean Bulking Is Attainable If You Focus Your Diet Accordingly with the Right Foods and Strategy.\" Joe Weider's Muscle & Fitness, vol. 75, no. 8, 2014, p. 89.</ref> To maintain a clean bulk it is important to reach calorie goals every day. [[Macronutrient]] goals will be different for each person, but, it is ideal to get as close as possible.\n\n====Dirty bulking====\n\"Dirty bulking\" is the process of eating at a massive caloric surplus, without trying to figure out the exact amount of ingested macronutrients (carbs, fats, and proteins). Weightlifters who are attempting to gain mass quickly with no [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] concerns often choose to use the \"dirty bulk\" method.<ref>Evans, Rian.

Retrieved on 2016-11-29.</ref>\n\n==== Pre-competition ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn the last week leading up to a contest, bodybuilders usually decrease their consumption of [[water]], [[Sodium in biology|sodium]], and [[carbohydrate]]s, the former two to alter how water is retained by the body and the latter to reduce [[glycogen]] in the muscle. The day before the show, water is removed from the diet, and [[diuretic]]s may be introduced, while [[carbohydrate loading]] is undertaken to increase the size of the muscles through replenishment of their glycogen. The goal is to maximize leanness and increase the visibility of veins, or \"[[vascularity]]\". The muscular definition and vascularity are further enhanced immediately before appearing on stage by darkening the skin through [[Sunless tanning|tanning products]] and applying [[Vegetable oil|oils]] to the skin to increase shine. Some competitors will eat sugar-rich foods to increase the visibility of their veins. A final step, called \"pumping\", consists in performing exercises with light weights or other kinds of low resistance (for instance two athletes can \"pump\" each other by holding a towel and pulling in turn), just before the contest, to fill the muscles with blood and further increase their size and density.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Muscle growth ==\nBodybuilders use three main strategies to maximize [[muscle hypertrophy]]:\n* [[Strength training]] through weights or elastic/hydraulic resistance.\n* Specialized [[nutrition]], incorporating extra [[protein]] and supplements when necessary.\n* Adequate rest, including sleep and recuperation between workouts.\n\nBodybuilders often shorten these three steps into the well-known motto \"eat clean, train hard, sleep well\".\n\n=== Weight training ===\n{{Main|Weight training|Strength training}}\n\nIntensive [[weight training]] causes micro-tears to the muscles being trained; this is generally known as [[microtrauma]]. These micro-tears in the muscle contribute to the soreness felt after exercise, called [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS). It is the repair of these micro-traumas that results in [[muscle growth]]. Normally, this soreness becomes most apparent a day or two after a workout. However, as muscles become adapted to the exercises, soreness tends to decrease.<ref name=\"pmid7371625\">{{cite journal|title=Effects of strength training and immobilization on human muscle fibres|year=1980|vauthors=MacDougall JD, Elder GC, Sale DG, Moroz JR, Sutton JR|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology|volume=43|issue=1|pages=25\u201334|pmid=7371625|doi=10.1007/BF00421352}}</ref>\n\nWeight training aims to build muscle by prompting two different types of [[Muscle hypertrophy|hypertrophy]]: sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy leads to larger muscles and so is favored by bodybuilders more than myofibrillar hypertrophy, which builds athletic strength. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is triggered by increasing repetitions, whereas myofibrillar hypertrophy is triggered by lifting heavier weight.<ref>{{cite web |title=Weight Training Intensity or Volume for Bigger Muscles?|url=http://www.motleyhealth.com/strength/weight-training-intensity-or-volume-for-bigger-muscles|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> In either case, there is an increase in both size and strength of the muscles (compared to what happens if that same individual does not lift weights at all), however, the emphasis is different.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nMany trainees like to cycle between the two methods in order to prevent the body from adapting (maintaining a progressive overload), possibly emphasizing whichever method more suits their goals; typically, a bodybuilder will aim at sarcoplasmic hypertrophy most of the time but may change to a myofibrillar hypertrophy kind of training temporarily in order to move past a plateau. However, no real evidence has been provided to show that trainees ever reach this plateau, and rather was more of a hype created from \"muscular confusion\".{{Clarify|date=January 2019}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Nutrition ===\nThe high levels of muscle growth and repair achieved by bodybuilders require a specialized diet. Generally speaking, bodybuilders require more [[Food energy|calories]] than the average person of the same weight to provide the protein and energy requirements needed to support their training and increase muscle mass. In preparation of a contest, a sub-maintenance level of food energy is combined with [[cardiovascular exercise]] to lose [[body fat]]. Proteins, carbohydrates and fats are the three major macronutrients that the human body needs in order to build muscle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Major Nutrients in Food|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/major-nutrients-in-food-topic-overview|publisher=webMd|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}</ref> The ratios of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats vary depending on the goals of the bodybuilder.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Manoreem MM, Thompson J, Russo M|title=Diet and exercise strategies of a world-class bodybuilder|journal=Int J Sport Nutr.|volume=3|issue=1|pages=76\u201386|date=March 1993|doi=10.1123/ijsn.3.1.76|pmid=8499940|accessdate=|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/15139f1395bff0699b645bd96461b0e129a3e8d3}}</ref>\n\n==== Carbohydrates ====\n[[Carbohydrate]]s play an important role for bodybuilders. They give the body energy to deal with the rigors of training and recovery. Carbohydrates also promote secretion of [[insulin]], a hormone enabling cells to get the glucose they need.

This is important as high-glycemic carbohydrates cause a sharp insulin response, which places the body in a state where it is likely to store additional food energy as fat. However, bodybuilders frequently do ingest some quickly digesting sugars (often in form of pure [[Glucose|dextrose]] or [[maltodextrin]]) just before, during, and/or just after a workout. This may help to replenish [[glycogen]] stored within the muscle, and to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.<ref>{{cite web |last=King|first=Michael W.|title=Substrates for Gluconeogenesis|website=|publisher=IU School of Medicine|url=http://web.indstate.edu/thcme/mwking/gluconeogenesis.html|doi=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==== Protein ====\n[[File:Protein_shake.jpg|thumb|Protein milkshakes, made from protein powder (center) and milk (left), are a common [[bodybuilding supplement]].]]\nThe motor proteins [[actin]] and [[myosin]] generate the forces exerted by contracting [[muscle]]s.

Chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish, eggs and dairy foods are high in protein, as are some nuts, seeds, beans, and lentils. [[Casein]] or [[Whey protein|whey]] are often used to supplement the diet with additional protein. Whey protein is the type of protein contained in many popular brands of protein supplements and is preferred by many bodybuilders because of its high [[Biological Value]] (BV) and quick absorption rates. [[Whey protein]] also has a bigger effect than casein on insulin levels, triggering about double the amount of insulin release.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0007114511006271|pmid=22289570|title=Greater stimulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis with ingestion of whey protein isolate v.

A combination of one part wheat protein (e.g., [[seitan]]) and two parts soy protein (e.g., [[tofu]]) has thus been favored by many bodybuilders.

There are many reasons why overtraining occurs, including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts, insufficient sleep, and training at a high intensity for too long (a lack of splitting apart workouts). Training at a high intensity too frequently also stimulates the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and can result in a hyperadrenergic state that interferes with sleep patterns.<ref name=\"LonnieLowery_Overtraining\">Lowery, Lonnie.

Timely provision of [[carbohydrate]]s, [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and various micronutrients such as [[vitamin]]s, [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], phytochemicals, even nutritional supplements are acutely critical. A mental disorder, informally called \u201cbigorexia\u201d (by analogy with [[anorexia]]), may account for overtraining in some individuals.

Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of [[Adipose tissue|nonessential body fat]], enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular [[dehydration]] and [[carbohydrate loading]], to achieve maximum muscular definition and [[vascularity]], as well as [[Sun tanning|tanning]] to accentuate the contrast of the skin under the spotlights.

He allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in \"muscle display performances\". Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]. The [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning 1936 [[musical film]] ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' depicts the beginning of modern bodybuilding, when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nSandow was so successful at flexing and posing his physique that he later created several businesses around his fame, and was among the first to market products branded with his name. He was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise equipment for the masses: machined [[dumbbell]]s, spring [[pulley]]s, and tension bands. Even his image was sold by the thousands in \"[[cabinet card]]s\" and other prints. Sandow was a perfect \"Gracilian\", a standard of [[Golden ratio|ideal body proportion]]s close to those of ancient Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statues. Men's physiques were then judged by how closely they matched these proportions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n====First large-scale bodybuilding competition====\nSandow organized the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901, called the \"Great Competition\". It was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rhodes|first=Jesse|title=Bodybuilders Through the Ages|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Bodybuilders-Through-the-Ages.html|date=July 19, 2009}}</ref> Judged by Sandow, Sir Charles Lawes, and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], the contest was a great success and many bodybuilding enthusiasts were turned away due to the overwhelming amount of audience members. The trophy presented to the winner was a gold statue of Sandow sculpted by Frederick Pomeroy. The winner was William L. Murray of [[Nottingham]]. The silver Sandow trophy was presented to second-place winner D. Cooper. The bronze Sandow trophy \u2014 now the most famous of all \u2014 was presented to third-place winner A.C. Smythe.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In 1950, this same bronze trophy was presented to [[Steve Reeves]] for winning the inaugural [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|NABBA]] [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] contest.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} It would not resurface again until 1977 when the winner of the [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] [[Mr. Olympia]] contest, [[Frank Zane]], was presented with a replica of the bronze trophy.

The number of bodybuilding organizations grew, and most notably the [[International Federation of Bodybuilders]] (IFBB) was founded in 1946 by Canadian brothers [[Joe Weider|Joe]] and [[Ben Weider]]. Other bodybuilding organizations included the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU), [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|National Amateur Bodybuilding Association]] (NABBA), and the World Bodybuilding Guild (WBBG). Consequently, the contests grew both in number and in size. Besides the many \"Mr. XXX\" (insert town, city, state, or region) championships, the most prestigious titles{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were Mr. America, Mr. World, Mr. Universe, Mr. Galaxy, and ultimately Mr. Olympia, which was started in 1965 by the IFBB and is now considered the most important bodybuilding competition in the world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the 1950s, the most successful and most famous competing bodybuilders{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were [[Bill Pearl]], [[Reg Park]], [[Leroy Colbert]], and [[Clarence Ross]]. Certain bodybuilders rose to fame thanks to the relatively new medium of television, as well as cinema. The most notable{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were [[Jack LaLanne]], [[Steve Reeves]], Reg Park, and [[Mickey Hargitay]]. While there were well-known gyms throughout the country during the 1950s (such as Vince's Gym in [[North Hollywood, California]] and [[Vic Tanny]]'s chain gyms), there were still segments of the United States that had no \"hardcore\" bodybuilding gyms until the advent of [[Gold's Gym]] in the mid-1960s.  Finally, the famed [[Muscle Beach]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] continued its popularity as the place to be for witnessing acrobatic acts, feats of strength, and the like. The movement grew more in the 1960s with increased TV and movie exposure, as bodybuilders were [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in popular shows and movies.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===1970s{{ndash}}1990s===\n==== New organizations ====\nIn the 1970s, bodybuilding had major publicity thanks to the appearance of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Franco Columbu]], [[Lou Ferrigno]], and others in the 1977 [[docudrama]] ''[[Pumping Iron]]''. By this time, the IFBB dominated the competitive bodybuilding landscape and the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) took a back seat. The [[National Physique Committee]] (NPC) was formed in 1981 by [[Jim Manion]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifbbpro.com/features/jim-manion-chairman-ifbb-professional-league/|title=IFBB Professional League - Jim Manion, Chairman IFBB Professional League|publisher=Ifbbpro.com|date=September 26, 2007|accessdate=October 5, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921210350/http://abhivacrossfitarena.com/|archivedate=September 21, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> who had just stepped down as chairman of the AAU Physique Committee. The NPC has gone on to become the most successful bodybuilding organization in America and is the amateur division of the IFBB. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the decline of AAU-sponsored bodybuilding contests. In 1999, the AAU voted to discontinue its bodybuilding events.\n\n==== Anabolic/androgenic steroid use ====\n[[File:Ronnie_Coleman_8_x_Mr_Olympia_-_2009_-_7.png|right|thumb|[[Ronnie Coleman]], eight-time [[Mr. Olympia]], pictured in October 2009]]\n\nThis period also saw the rise of [[anabolic steroid]]s in bodybuilding and many other sports. In bodybuilding lore, this is partly attributed to the rise of \"mass monsters\", beginning with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Sergio Oliva]], and [[Lou Ferrigno]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and continuing through the 1980s with [[Lee Haney]], the 1990s with [[Dorian Yates]], [[Ronnie Coleman]], and [[Markus R\u00fchl]], and up to the present day. Bodybuilders such as [[Greg Kovacs]] attained mass and size never seen previously but were not successful at the pro level. Others were renowned for their spectacular development of a particular body part, like [[Tom Platz]] or [[Paul Demayo]] for their leg muscles. At the time of shooting ''Pumping Iron'', Schwarzenegger (while never admitting to steroid use until long after his retirement) said that \"you have to do anything you can to get the advantage in competition\".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} He would later say that he does not regret using anything.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-676684.html|newspaper=CBS|date=February 11, 2009|title=Arnold: No Regrets About Steroids|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo combat anabolic steroid use and in the hopes of becoming a member of the [[IOC]], the IFBB introduced [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] tests for both steroids and other banned substances. Although doping tests occurred, the majority of professional bodybuilders still used anabolic steroids for competition. During the 1970s, the use of anabolic steroids was openly discussed, partly due to the fact they were legal.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Theunissen|first=Steve|title=Arnold & Steroids: Truth Revealed|url=http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008172601/http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm|archivedate=October 8, 2003|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990, [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] placed anabolic steroids into Schedule III of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA).

McMahon wanted to bring [[WWE|WWF]]-style showmanship and bigger prize money to the sport of bodybuilding. A number of IFBB stars were recruited but the roster was never very large and featured the same athletes competing; the most notable winner and first WBF champion was [[Gary Strydom]]. McMahon formally dissolved the WBF in July 1992. Reasons for this reportedly included lack of income from the pay-per-view broadcasts of the contests, slow sales of the WBF's magazine ''Bodybuilding Lifestyles'' (later ''WBF Magazine''), and the expense of paying multiple six-figure contracts while producing two TV shows and a monthly magazine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, [[Joe Weider]] sold Weider Publications to [[American Media (publisher)|AMI]], which owns the ''[[National Enquirer]]''. The position of president of the IFBB was filled by Rafael Santonja following the death of [[Ben Weider]] in October 2008. In 2004, contest promoter Wayne DeMilia broke ranks with the IFBB and AMI took over the promotion of the Mr. Olympia contest: in 2017 AMI took the contest outright.<ref>American Media Inc., \"American Media, Inc.

This resulted in the emergence of whole new populations of bodybuilders from former [[Eastern Bloc]] states.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Olympic sport discussion ====\nIn the early 2000s, the IFBB was attempting to make bodybuilding an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport. It obtained full IOC membership in 2000 and was attempting to get approved as a demonstration event at the Olympics, which would hopefully lead to it being added as a full contest. This did not happen and Olympic recognition for bodybuilding remains controversial since many argue that bodybuilding is not a sport.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Littman|first=Jean|title=Bodybuilding And The Olympics: An Ongoing Controversy|publisher=article99.com|url=http://www.article99.com/recreation-and-sports/olympics/article.php?art=63758|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205174022/http://www.article99.com/recreation-and-sports/olympics/article.php?art=63758|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 5, 2007|date=November 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Areas ==\n=== Professional bodybuilding ===\n{{Main|Professional bodybuilding}}\n[[File:Frank_Zane.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Zane]], three-time Mr. Olympia]]\nIn the modern bodybuilding industry, the term \"[[Professional bodybuilding|professional]]\" generally means a bodybuilder who has won qualifying competitions as an amateur and has earned a \"pro card\" from their respective organization. Professionals earn the right to compete in competitions that include monetary prizes. A pro card also prohibits the athlete from competing in federations other than the one from which they have received the pro card.<ref>[http://www.ifbb.com/ifbb-faq/ Ifbb Faq \u2013 Ifbb]. Ifbb.com (February 22, 1999). Retrieved on 2016-11-29.</ref> Depending on the level of success, these bodybuilders may receive monetary compensation from sponsors, much like athletes in other sports.\n\n===Natural bodybuilding {{anchor|MuscleMania|UFE|INBF|WNBF|INBA|PNBA|NPC|NANBF}}===\n{{Main|Natural bodybuilding}}\nDue to the growing concerns of the high cost, health consequences, and illegal nature of some steroids, many organizations have formed in response and have deemed themselves \"natural\" bodybuilding competitions. In addition to the concerns noted, many promoters of bodybuilding have sought to shed the \"freakish\" perception that the general public has of bodybuilding and have successfully introduced a more mainstream audience to the sport of bodybuilding by including competitors whose physiques appear much more attainable and realistic.<ref name=\"natural\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/beginner_natural_bodybuilding_guide.htm|title=Beginner's Guide To Natural Bodybuilding Competition: Disseminating Misconception From Reality!|website=Bodybuilding.com|accessdate=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\nIn natural contests, the testing protocol ranges among organizations from [[Polygraph test|lie detectors]] to [[urinalysis]]. Penalties also range from organization to organization from suspensions to strict bans from competition. It is also important to note that natural organizations also have their own list of banned substances and it is important to refer to each organization's website for more information about which substances are banned from competition. There are many natural bodybuilding organizations; some of the larger ones include: MuscleMania, Ultimate Fitness Events (UFE), INBF/WNBF, and INBA/PNBA. These organizations either have an American or worldwide presence and are not limited to the country in which they are headquartered.<ref name=\"natural\"/>\n\n=== Men's Physique ===\nDue to the number of people who found bodybuilding to be \"too big\" or \"ugly\" and unhealthy, a new category was started in 2013. The first MR. Olympia was Mark Wingson, which was followed by Jeremy Buendia for consecutive years. Like bodybuilding, the federations in which you can compete in are all the same, there is natural and regular as well but the main difference between the two is that men's physique pose in board shorts rather than a traditional posing suit. Bodybuilders are much larger than the men physique competitors as well as have an extensive routine when posing while the Physique category only gets judged by the front and back poses. Many of the competitors are not freakishly large and have a bit of a more attainable and aesthetic physique in comparison to bodybuilding. Although this category started off slow, it grew tremendously in the past 5 years, now Men's Physique seems to be the most popular class to be in.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Classic Physique ===\nThis is the middle ground of both Men's Physique and Bodybuilding. The competitors in this category are not nearly as big as bodybuilders but not as small as mens physique competitors. They pose and perform in mens boxer briefs to show off the legs, unlike Mens Physique which hide the legs in board shorts. Classic physique has only been around for 3 years now as it started in 2016. Danny Hester was the first Classic Physique Mr. Olympia and now Chris Bumstead is the 2019 Mr. Olympia. {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Female bodybuilding ===\n{{main|Female bodybuilding}}\n[[File:Nikki_Fuller.jpg|thumb|Pro female bodybuilder [[Nikki Fuller]] performing a side chest pose]]\nThe first U.S. Women's National Physique Championship, promoted by Henry McGhee and held in [[Canton, Ohio]] in 1978, is generally regarded as the first true female bodybuilding contest\u2014that is, the first contest where the entrants were judged solely on muscularity.<ref>Todd, Jan, \"Bodybuilding\", St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture, Gale Group, 1999</ref> In 1980, the first [[Ms. Olympia]] (initially known as the \"Miss\" Olympia), the most prestigious contest for professionals, was held. The first winner was [[Rachel McLish]], who had also won the NPC's USA Championship earlier in the year. The contest was a major turning point for female bodybuilding. McLish inspired many future competitors to start training and competing. In 1985, a movie called ''[[Pumping Iron II: The Women]]'' was released. It documented the preparation of several women for the 1983 [[Caesars Palace]] World Cup Championship. Competitors prominently featured in the film were Kris Alexander, Lori Bowen, Lydia Cheng, Carla Dunlap, [[Bev Francis]], and McLish. At the time, Francis was actually a [[Powerlifting|powerlifter]], though she soon made a successful transition to bodybuilding, becoming one of the leading competitors of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nIn recent years, the related areas of [[fitness and figure competition]] have increased in popularity, surpassing that of female bodybuilding, and have provided an alternative for women who choose not to develop the level of muscularity necessary for bodybuilding. McLish would closely resemble what is thought of today as a fitness and figure competitor, instead of what is now considered a female bodybuilder. Fitness competitions also have a [[gymnastic]] element to them. A study by the ''[[Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine]]'' found that female bodybuilders who are taking [[anabolic steroid]]s are more likely to have qualified for [[Substance dependence|substance dependence disorder]], to have been diagnosed with a [[psychiatric illness]], or to have a history of [[sexual abuse]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Mitchell|title=Women and Anabolic Steroids: An Analysis of a Dozen Users|journal=Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine|date=Nov 2010|volume=20|issue=6|pages=475\u201381|pmid=21079445|doi=10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181fb5370}}</ref>\n\nE.

Each competitor also performs a personal choreographed routine to display their physique. A [[posedown]] is usually held at the end of a posing round, while judges are finishing their scoring. Bodybuilders usually spend a lot of time practising their posing in front of mirrors or under the guidance of their coach.\n\nIn contrast to [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] or [[powerlifting]] competitions, where [[physical strength]] is paramount, or to [[Olympic weightlifting]], where the main point is equally split between strength and technique, bodybuilding competitions typically emphasize condition, size, and symmetry. Different organizations emphasize particular aspects of competition, and sometimes have different categories in which to compete.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Preparations ===\n==== Bulking and cutting ====\nThe general strategy adopted by most present-day competitive bodybuilders is to make muscle gains for most of the year (known as the \"off-season\") and, approximately 12\u201314 weeks from competition, lose a maximum of [[Adipose tissue|body fat]] (referred to as \"cutting\") while preserving as much muscular mass as possible. The bulking phase entails remaining in a net positive energy balance ([[calorie]] surplus). The amount of a surplus in which a person remains is based on the person's goals, as a bigger surplus and longer bulking phase will create more fat tissue. The surplus of calories relative to one's energy balance will ensure that muscles remain in a state of [[anabolism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mensjournal.com/food-drink/reverse-dieting-how-go-cut-bulk-without-gaining-fat|work=[[Men's Journal]]|title=Reverse Dieting: How to Go From Cut to Bulk Without Gaining Fat|accessdate=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\nThe cutting phase entails remaining in a net negative energy balance (calorie deficit). The main goal of cutting is to [[Oxidized fats|oxidize]] fat while preserving as much muscle as possible. The larger the calorie deficit, the faster one will lose weight. However, a large calorie deficit will also create the risk of losing muscle tissue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Charles|author2=Frank L|author3=Evens W|title=Macronutrient considerations for the sport of bodybuilding.|journal=Sports Med|date=March 2004|volume=34|issue=5|pages=317\u201327|pmid=15107010|doi=10.2165/00007256-200434050-00004}}</ref>\n\nThe bulking and cutting strategy is effective because there is a well-established link between muscle hypertrophy and being in a state of positive energy balance.<ref>the science and development of muscle hypertrophy, Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, page 139-140</ref> A sustained period of caloric surplus will allow the athlete to gain more fat-free mass than they could otherwise gain under eucaloric conditions. Some gain in fat mass is expected, which athletes seek to oxidize in a cutting period while maintaining as much lean mass as possible.\n\n==== Clean bulking ====\nMany non-competitive bodybuilders choose not to adopt this conventional strategy, as it often results in significant unwanted fat gain during the \"bulking\" phase. The attempt to increase muscle mass in one's body without any gain in fat is called clean bulking. Competitive bodybuilders focus their efforts to achieve a peak appearance during a brief \"competition season\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Clean bulking takes longer and is a more refined approach to achieving the body fat and muscle mass percentage a person is looking for. A common tactic for keeping fat low and muscle mass high would be to have higher calorie and lower calorie days to maintain a balance between gain and loss. Many clean bulk diets start off with a moderate amount of carbs, moderate amount of protein, and a decently low amount of fats. \"Gaining lean muscle means going for leaner cuts of meat, like flank steaks and fillets, chicken, and, of course, fish,\" says White{{Who|date=January 2019}}. \"Enjoy your meat with some starch: rice, beans, quinoa, whole-grain couscous, or sweet potato, for example\".<ref>Giblin, Chris. \"Clean Bulking: for Frustrated Hard-Gainers, Clean Bulking Is Attainable If You Focus Your Diet Accordingly with the Right Foods and Strategy.\" Joe Weider's Muscle & Fitness, vol. 75, no. 8, 2014, p. 89.</ref> To maintain a clean bulk it is important to reach calorie goals every day. [[Macronutrient]] goals will be different for each person, but, it is ideal to get as close as possible.\n\n====Dirty bulking====\n\"Dirty bulking\" is the process of eating at a massive caloric surplus, without trying to figure out the exact amount of ingested macronutrients (carbs, fats, and proteins). Weightlifters who are attempting to gain mass quickly with no [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] concerns often choose to use the \"dirty bulk\" method.<ref>Evans, Rian.

Retrieved on 2016-11-29.</ref>\n\n==== Pre-competition ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn the last week leading up to a contest, bodybuilders usually decrease their consumption of [[water]], [[Sodium in biology|sodium]], and [[carbohydrate]]s, the former two to alter how water is retained by the body and the latter to reduce [[glycogen]] in the muscle. The day before the show, water is removed from the diet, and [[diuretic]]s may be introduced, while [[carbohydrate loading]] is undertaken to increase the size of the muscles through replenishment of their glycogen. The goal is to maximize leanness and increase the visibility of veins, or \"[[vascularity]]\". The muscular definition and vascularity are further enhanced immediately before appearing on stage by darkening the skin through [[Sunless tanning|tanning products]] and applying [[Vegetable oil|oils]] to the skin to increase shine. Some competitors will eat sugar-rich foods to increase the visibility of their veins. A final step, called \"pumping\", consists in performing exercises with light weights or other kinds of low resistance (for instance two athletes can \"pump\" each other by holding a towel and pulling in turn), just before the contest, to fill the muscles with blood and further increase their size and density.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Muscle growth ==\nBodybuilders use three main strategies to maximize [[muscle hypertrophy]]:\n* [[Strength training]] through weights or elastic/hydraulic resistance.\n* Specialized [[nutrition]], incorporating extra [[protein]] and supplements when necessary.\n* Adequate rest, including sleep and recuperation between workouts.\n\nBodybuilders often shorten these three steps into the well-known motto \"eat clean, train hard, sleep well\".\n\n=== Weight training ===\n{{Main|Weight training|Strength training}}\n\nIntensive [[weight training]] causes micro-tears to the muscles being trained; this is generally known as [[microtrauma]]. These micro-tears in the muscle contribute to the soreness felt after exercise, called [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS). It is the repair of these micro-traumas that results in [[muscle growth]]. Normally, this soreness becomes most apparent a day or two after a workout. However, as muscles become adapted to the exercises, soreness tends to decrease.<ref name=\"pmid7371625\">{{cite journal|title=Effects of strength training and immobilization on human muscle fibres|year=1980|vauthors=MacDougall JD, Elder GC, Sale DG, Moroz JR, Sutton JR|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology|volume=43|issue=1|pages=25\u201334|pmid=7371625|doi=10.1007/BF00421352}}</ref>\n\nWeight training aims to build muscle by prompting two different types of [[Muscle hypertrophy|hypertrophy]]: sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy leads to larger muscles and so is favored by bodybuilders more than myofibrillar hypertrophy, which builds athletic strength. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is triggered by increasing repetitions, whereas myofibrillar hypertrophy is triggered by lifting heavier weight.<ref>{{cite web |title=Weight Training Intensity or Volume for Bigger Muscles?|url=http://www.motleyhealth.com/strength/weight-training-intensity-or-volume-for-bigger-muscles|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> In either case, there is an increase in both size and strength of the muscles (compared to what happens if that same individual does not lift weights at all), however, the emphasis is different.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nMany trainees like to cycle between the two methods in order to prevent the body from adapting (maintaining a progressive overload), possibly emphasizing whichever method more suits their goals; typically, a bodybuilder will aim at sarcoplasmic hypertrophy most of the time but may change to a myofibrillar hypertrophy kind of training temporarily in order to move past a plateau. However, no real evidence has been provided to show that trainees ever reach this plateau, and rather was more of a hype created from \"muscular confusion\".{{Clarify|date=January 2019}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Nutrition ===\nThe high levels of muscle growth and repair achieved by bodybuilders require a specialized diet. Generally speaking, bodybuilders require more [[Food energy|calories]] than the average person of the same weight to provide the protein and energy requirements needed to support their training and increase muscle mass. In preparation of a contest, a sub-maintenance level of food energy is combined with [[cardiovascular exercise]] to lose [[body fat]]. Proteins, carbohydrates and fats are the three major macronutrients that the human body needs in order to build muscle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Major Nutrients in Food|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/major-nutrients-in-food-topic-overview|publisher=webMd|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}</ref> The ratios of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats vary depending on the goals of the bodybuilder.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Manoreem MM, Thompson J, Russo M|title=Diet and exercise strategies of a world-class bodybuilder|journal=Int J Sport Nutr.|volume=3|issue=1|pages=76\u201386|date=March 1993|doi=10.1123/ijsn.3.1.76|pmid=8499940|accessdate=|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/15139f1395bff0699b645bd96461b0e129a3e8d3}}</ref>\n\n==== Carbohydrates ====\n[[Carbohydrate]]s play an important role for bodybuilders. They give the body energy to deal with the rigors of training and recovery. Carbohydrates also promote secretion of [[insulin]], a hormone enabling cells to get the glucose they need.

This is important as high-glycemic carbohydrates cause a sharp insulin response, which places the body in a state where it is likely to store additional food energy as fat. However, bodybuilders frequently do ingest some quickly digesting sugars (often in form of pure [[Glucose|dextrose]] or [[maltodextrin]]) just before, during, and/or just after a workout. This may help to replenish [[glycogen]] stored within the muscle, and to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.<ref>{{cite web |last=King|first=Michael W.|title=Substrates for Gluconeogenesis|website=|publisher=IU School of Medicine|url=http://web.indstate.edu/thcme/mwking/gluconeogenesis.html|doi=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==== Protein ====\n[[File:Protein_shake.jpg|thumb|Protein milkshakes, made from protein powder (center) and milk (left), are a common [[bodybuilding supplement]].]]\nThe motor proteins [[actin]] and [[myosin]] generate the forces exerted by contracting [[muscle]]s.

Chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish, eggs and dairy foods are high in protein, as are some nuts, seeds, beans, and lentils. [[Casein]] or [[Whey protein|whey]] are often used to supplement the diet with additional protein. Whey protein is the type of protein contained in many popular brands of protein supplements and is preferred by many bodybuilders because of its high [[Biological Value]] (BV) and quick absorption rates. [[Whey protein]] also has a bigger effect than casein on insulin levels, triggering about double the amount of insulin release.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0007114511006271|pmid=22289570|title=Greater stimulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis with ingestion of whey protein isolate v.

The western section of the border (i.e. the bulk of the modern Afghan-Turkmen boundary) was to be determined at a later date by a boundary commission.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTensions mounted as the Russians expanded further into what is now Turkmenistan in the early 1880s, reaching a crisis with the [[Panjdeh incident]] (near [[Sandykachi]] in what is now Turkmenistan), an area claimed by Afghanistan.

Genevieve/Gasper limestones.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> The valley rests on the [[Upper Mississippian]] [[Maccrady Formation]], an erratic sequence of [[shales]], [[siltstones]], and minor [[sandstones]] that possesses [[limestones]] that integrate considerable amounts of [[gypsum]], [[anhydrite]], and [[halite]].<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> Prior to 13,500 [[RCYBP]] in late [[Pleistocene]] times, the valley contained a river which subsequently transformed into a lake.

Ray during joint salvage test excavations held from 1966 through 1967 by the Smithsonian and Virginia Polytechnic Institute. In 1978, the remains of thirty four fossilized musk oxen were discovered by C.S. Bartlett Jr. in a salvage excavation. The spring of 1980, Jerry McDonald discovered the third most complete musk oxen skeleton ever found with a total of 49 bones circa 1983.<ref name=\"Bartlett\"/>\n\nFossilized components of a giant short faced bear (arctodus simus) were discovered in 1999 in the form of a canine, and supplementing dentary found a year later nearby. These are the only known carnivorous megafauna that have been found in the Saltville Valley.<ref name=\"Schubert\"/> AMS radiocarbon dates were taken from a sample of preserved collagen and produced a date of 14,853 + 55 RCYBP for the fossil.<ref name=\"Schubert\"/> This is the only specimen of giant short faced bear found in the Appalachian Highlands.<ref name=\"Schubert\"/>\n\nMammoth remains are currently being excavated as of 2009. A set of complete ribs, vertebrae, a scapula, and tarsals have been found to date. A left astragalus, left calcaneus, and an undistinguished partial carpal or tarsal exhibit postmortem alterations that may represent carnivorous scavenging by either a wolf (canis dirus), large bear (arctodus simus), or an American lion (panthera atrox).<ref name=\"Schubert\"/> The collagen taken from the mammoth yielded an age of 14,510 + 55 RCYBP.<ref name=\"Schubert\"/> It was determined that the remains were scavenged.\n\n==Major floral discoveries==\nIn 1967, samples gathered from the endocranial cavity of a musk-ox yielded pollen that demonstrated the Saltville Valley contained a spruce parkland with ponds, marshes, and prairies. Additional knowledge about the environment was revealed by a sediment sample reported by H. R. Delcourt and P.A. Delcourt in 1986 which displayed mixed forest with boreal conifers, and hardwoods.<ref name=\"Schubert\"/> The bottom land was characterized by [[spruce]], [[fir]], [[grasses]], [[shrubs]], [[herbs]], and [[sedges]] that display boreal woodland marshes. The most recent study of the valley published in 2007, examined megafaunal herbivores for their trophic relationships.<ref name=\"Schubert\"/> The carbon nitrogen isotope ratios from preserved bone collagen and other fossilized organic matter indicated C-4 plants and grasses were absent in the bottomlands of the valley, with C-3 vegetation dominant.<ref name=\"Schubert\"/>\n\n==Stratigraphy==\nThere are seven stratigraphic levels present within the Saltville Valley in archaeological context. The first two are H-1 through H-2, and represent the historic periods through the early, middle, and late Holocene. At site SV-2 H-1 is not present since it was removed by bulldozers in 1964-1965. The next 4 levels are labeled W-1 through W-4. W-1 represents the transition from late Wisconsinan to Holocene period, and the subsequent W levels display the rest of the late Wisconsinan. P-1, the last level exhibits the Upper Mississippian Maccrady Formation.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/>\n\n==SV-2 and pre-Clovis activity==\nEvidence of pre-Clovis activity was found at the SV-2 site. There are three archaeological horizons evident of human occupation located within a one-meter thick alluvial, colluvial, and lacustrine sediments overlying a pedestal of bedrock.<ref name=\"Goodyear\"/> These are dated within 14,510, and 13,500-13,000 RCYBP.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> The oldest horizon is dated to 14,510 + 80  RCYBP (Beta-117541) by the presence of a tibia bone tool from a musk ox that was AMS radiocarbon dated.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/>  Evidence for the butchering/cooking of a mastodon was found in this level. It is believed that one individual was represented. Seven complete or partial ribs, two fragments of limb bones, one tooth, and nine pieces of tusk, all of these display alike surface characteristics lacking signs of fluvial abrasion or extensive subaerial weathering.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> Evidence that this mastodon was processed and cooked includes the presence of two sandstone knives with worked edges that were used to cut meat and/ or remove hide. A concretion representing a congealed mass of viscous fluid replaced by minerals, may represent fat drippings produced by cooking with fire. Fire cracked rocks and a burned mastodon tooth were also found. Also associated were a triangular stone used as a hand held ax or wedge, a piece of exotic chert used as wedge chert flake, and two pieces of bone modified by human agency. The first of these is an incised basicranial complex of a midsized herbivore, and possible tibia bone tool AMS dated back to 14, 510 RCYBP which suggests a Pre Clovis occupation.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> It was from the shaft of a right tibia of what was assumed to be a midsized adult musk-ox since it was too gracile to belong to a bison with identification also based on surface details, absolute size, elongative nature, and the presence of other musk-oxen bone and teeth. It measured 195.2&nbsp;mm in length, 48.9mm in maximum width across the proximal end of the medial surface, 36&nbsp;mm in peak width in transverse (medial-lateral) section.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> The tibia bone exhibits three pairs of parallel fractures, two percussion fracture cone in the medullary cavity, and extensive non-random patterned wear. The fractures could have either occurred with one or numerous blow with the goal of obtaining marrow. The wear pattern indicates that the bone tool was used as a scraper or flesher, and might have been used as a meat or hide splitter.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/>\n\nThe middle horizon contains two features in a fluvial sand lens. The first has a collection of lithics that are either [[stone tools]], byproducts of stone tools, or material with the potential to be made into stone tools.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> Also present were fish bones, a piece of charcoal, and 12 pieces of microdebitage of which three show signs that bifacial retouch occurred.<ref name=\"Goodyear\"/> The second feature contained seven concretions. Five of these were elongated, and one was prismatic. These were found in maroon mud, but were grey bodied. Indicating they originated in a different sedimentary environment. All pieces found originated as congealed viscous body fat, but was replaced by minerals from ground water.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> Twigs were found in the sand lens that provided a date of 13,950 + 70 RCYBP Beta (65209).<ref name=\"McDonald\"/>\n\nThe youngest horizon contained one feature that contained 200 immature individuals of the giant floater clam, Pyganodon grandis, a mussel which usually lives in impoundments or slow moving streams beneath mud.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> Fish and amphibian vertebrates were uncovered with charcoal, lithic debris, and 125 possible pieces of foreign microdebitage that yield a small number of pieces connected to bifacial retouching. This feature is thought to date from 13,500 to 13,000 RCYBP because of interpretive information about the deposit\u2019s creation.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal | last1 = McDonald | first1 = J.

A set of complete ribs, vertebrae, a scapula, and tarsals have been found to date. A left astragalus, left calcaneus, and an undistinguished partial carpal or tarsal exhibit postmortem alterations that may represent carnivorous scavenging by either a wolf (canis dirus), large bear (arctodus simus), or an American lion (panthera atrox).<ref name=\"Schubert\"/> The collagen taken from the mammoth yielded an age of 14,510 + 55 RCYBP.<ref name=\"Schubert\"/> It was determined that the remains were scavenged.\n\n==Major floral discoveries==\nIn 1967, samples gathered from the endocranial cavity of a musk-ox yielded pollen that demonstrated the Saltville Valley contained a spruce parkland with ponds, marshes, and prairies. Additional knowledge about the environment was revealed by a sediment sample reported by H. R. Delcourt and P.A. Delcourt in 1986 which displayed mixed forest with boreal conifers, and hardwoods.<ref name=\"Schubert\"/> The bottom land was characterized by [[spruce]], [[fir]], [[grasses]], [[shrubs]], [[herbs]], and [[sedges]] that display boreal woodland marshes. The most recent study of the valley published in 2007, examined megafaunal herbivores for their trophic relationships.<ref name=\"Schubert\"/> The carbon nitrogen isotope ratios from preserved bone collagen and other fossilized organic matter indicated C-4 plants and grasses were absent in the bottomlands of the valley, with C-3 vegetation dominant.<ref name=\"Schubert\"/>\n\n==Stratigraphy==\nThere are seven stratigraphic levels present within the Saltville Valley in archaeological context. The first two are H-1 through H-2, and represent the historic periods through the early, middle, and late Holocene. At site SV-2 H-1 is not present since it was removed by bulldozers in 1964-1965. The next 4 levels are labeled W-1 through W-4. W-1 represents the transition from late Wisconsinan to Holocene period, and the subsequent W levels display the rest of the late Wisconsinan. P-1, the last level exhibits the Upper Mississippian Maccrady Formation.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/>\n\n==SV-2 and pre-Clovis activity==\nEvidence of pre-Clovis activity was found at the SV-2 site. There are three archaeological horizons evident of human occupation located within a one-meter thick alluvial, colluvial, and lacustrine sediments overlying a pedestal of bedrock.<ref name=\"Goodyear\"/> These are dated within 14,510, and 13,500-13,000 RCYBP.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> The oldest horizon is dated to 14,510 + 80  RCYBP (Beta-117541) by the presence of a tibia bone tool from a musk ox that was AMS radiocarbon dated.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/>  Evidence for the butchering/cooking of a mastodon was found in this level. It is believed that one individual was represented. Seven complete or partial ribs, two fragments of limb bones, one tooth, and nine pieces of tusk, all of these display alike surface characteristics lacking signs of fluvial abrasion or extensive subaerial weathering.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> Evidence that this mastodon was processed and cooked includes the presence of two sandstone knives with worked edges that were used to cut meat and/ or remove hide. A concretion representing a congealed mass of viscous fluid replaced by minerals, may represent fat drippings produced by cooking with fire. Fire cracked rocks and a burned mastodon tooth were also found. Also associated were a triangular stone used as a hand held ax or wedge, a piece of exotic chert used as wedge chert flake, and two pieces of bone modified by human agency. The first of these is an incised basicranial complex of a midsized herbivore, and possible tibia bone tool AMS dated back to 14, 510 RCYBP which suggests a Pre Clovis occupation.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> It was from the shaft of a right tibia of what was assumed to be a midsized adult musk-ox since it was too gracile to belong to a bison with identification also based on surface details, absolute size, elongative nature, and the presence of other musk-oxen bone and teeth. It measured 195.2&nbsp;mm in length, 48.9mm in maximum width across the proximal end of the medial surface, 36&nbsp;mm in peak width in transverse (medial-lateral) section.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> The tibia bone exhibits three pairs of parallel fractures, two percussion fracture cone in the medullary cavity, and extensive non-random patterned wear. The fractures could have either occurred with one or numerous blow with the goal of obtaining marrow. The wear pattern indicates that the bone tool was used as a scraper or flesher, and might have been used as a meat or hide splitter.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/>\n\nThe middle horizon contains two features in a fluvial sand lens. The first has a collection of lithics that are either [[stone tools]], byproducts of stone tools, or material with the potential to be made into stone tools.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> Also present were fish bones, a piece of charcoal, and 12 pieces of microdebitage of which three show signs that bifacial retouch occurred.<ref name=\"Goodyear\"/> The second feature contained seven concretions. Five of these were elongated, and one was prismatic. These were found in maroon mud, but were grey bodied. Indicating they originated in a different sedimentary environment. All pieces found originated as congealed viscous body fat, but was replaced by minerals from ground water.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> Twigs were found in the sand lens that provided a date of 13,950 + 70 RCYBP Beta (65209).<ref name=\"McDonald\"/>\n\nThe youngest horizon contained one feature that contained 200 immature individuals of the giant floater clam, Pyganodon grandis, a mussel which usually lives in impoundments or slow moving streams beneath mud.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/> Fish and amphibian vertebrates were uncovered with charcoal, lithic debris, and 125 possible pieces of foreign microdebitage that yield a small number of pieces connected to bifacial retouching. This feature is thought to date from 13,500 to 13,000 RCYBP because of interpretive information about the deposit\u2019s creation.<ref name=\"McDonald\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*McDonald, J.

The passwords that are tested are generated from a dictionary using various [[mutation (genetic algorithm)]] methods, including case mutation (password, PASSWORD, PassWOrD, etc.), year mutation (password, password1992, password67, etc.), and many other mutations to try to guess the correct password.\n\nThe advantages of using such methods over the traditional ones, such as [[rainbow table]]s,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wirelessdefence.org/Contents/coWPAttyMain.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326001431/http://wirelessdefence.org/Contents/coWPAttyMain.htm |archive-date=2012-03-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> are numerous. Rainbow tables, being very large in size because of the amount of SSID/Password combinations saved, take a long time to traverse, cannot have large numbers of passwords per SSID, and are reliant on the SSID being a common one which the rainbow table has already listed hash codes for (Common ones include linksys, belkin54g, etc.). EWSA, however, uses a relatively small dictionary file (a few megabytes versus dozens of gigabytes for common rainbow tables) and creates the passwords on the fly as needed. Rainbow tables are tested against a captured WPA/WPA2 Hash Code via a computer's processor with relatively low numbers of simultaneous processes possible.

Most of the studies in this area are large [[Prospective cohort study|prospective studies]] that follow people over time, and while there may be a [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] between the two variables (friendship and health status), researchers still do not know if there is a cause and effect relationship, such as the notion that good friendships actually improve health. A number of theories have attempted to explain this link. These theories have included that good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; that good friends encourage their friends to seek help and access services when needed; that good friends enhance their friends' coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and that good friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health.<ref>Social networks and health: It's time for an intervention trial. 2005.
