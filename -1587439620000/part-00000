It has become an \u201cInternational, interdisciplinary network of scholars communicating and sharing resources through a variety of interactive media.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.h-net.org/about/press/oah/peter.html|title=H-Net: Its Past, Present, and Future|last=Knupfer|first=Peter|date=|work=OAH Newsletter|access-date=}}</ref> It is made up of nearly 200 discipline-specific networks that host moderated scholarly discussion, announcements, reviews, formal and informal publications and other scholarly digital content. In addition to dedicated networks, H-Net services include the H-Net Job Guide, H-Net Reviews, H-Announce, the H-Net Book Channel, and the new H-Net journal services. Individual networks are edited and moderated by teams of volunteer editors who are scholars in the network\u2019s subject field.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/513/pages/1301/about|title=About H-Net {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Each network is required to have an advisory board and a staff of online editors. Included in the staff are the positions of the Vice President of Networks, the Vice President of Teaching, and the Vice President of Research and Publications. Elections for the H-Net Executive council occur on an annual basis and are run by the President of Networks. The executive committee is composed of seven representatives, the Executive Director, the Associate Directors, and a treasurer and secretary are appointed.<ref name=\":0\" /> H-Net upholds the goal of maintaining open access scholarly resources. This includes the internationalization of resources to create global accessibility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/may-1995/h-net-and-the-internationalization-of-scholarship|title=H-Net and the Internationalization of Scholarship {{!}} Perspectives on History {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\nH-Net is hosted by the Department of History at [[Michigan State University]], but H-Net officers, editors, and subscribers come from all over the globe.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://history.msu.edu/h-net-celebrates-20-years-at-msu/|title=MSU History Department|last=University|first=Michigan State|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\n== History of H-Net ==\n'''H-Net: Humanities & Social Sciences Online''' was founded in 1993 by [[Richard J. Jensen|Richard Jensen]], a history professor at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois - Chicago]]. He was assisted by Wendy Plotkin (a graduate student at the University of Illinois) and James Mott (a PhD of the University of Illinois). H-Net began in the form of a [[LISTSERV]], users could subscribe to groups or \u201clists\u201d and receive notifications in their in-boxes. This platform connected scholars through their in-boxes and made use of the new uses of e-mail. \u00a0\n\nThe earliest lists included: H-Urban, H-Women, H-Holocaust, H-Diplo, H-CivWar, H-Law, H-LatAm, H-South, H-Rural, H-Amstdy, H-Ethnic, H-Albion, H-Teach, H-Judaic, H-OIEAHC (later renamed H-Early-America), H-Film, H-Rhetor, H-Labor, and H-Pol.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/hnet25|title=H-Net 25th Anniversary Crossroads {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> The largest list at the time was HOLOCAUS (later renamed H-Holocaust), with 290 subscribers.\n\nIn 1994, H-Net created its first formal governance structure and elected an executive committee with Richard Jensen as the first Executive Director. H-Net's governance structure consisted of seven elected officers and nine elected council members <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/may-2007/h-net-digital-discussion-for-historians|title=H-Net: Digital Discussion for Historians {{!}} Perspectives on History {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> This is also the year that H-Net began technology training workshops specifically for the humanities as a part of an [[National Endowment for the Humanities|NEH]] project aimed at introducing scholars to digital humanities and training them to use the internet as a tool.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web |url=http://members.aol.com/dann01/whatis.html |title=Internet's Republic of Letters: H-Net for Scholars |author=Richard Jensen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000903084512/http://members.aol.com/dann01/whatis.html |archive-date=2000-09-03 |website= |access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\nThe home office of H-Net moved to Michigan State University's History Department in 1995. The organization held conferences, in conjunction with the [[American Historical Association|AHA]], for all the editors of H-Net in 1995 and again in 1996. H-Net received grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Japanese Foundation (Tokyo); some networks were endorsed by or affiliated with either home campuses or related organizations.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIn 1996, H-Net took on 4 staffers along with a variety of student helpers at Michigan State University.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIn 1997, MSU appointed its history Professor Mark Kornbluh as Executive Director, and founded MATRIX: MSU's Humanities Technology Center.

2018 the H-Net Editors worked with the Home Office programmers to launch a new way for users to browse the H-Net Commons to find content of interest outside the networks to which they have subscribed. A hub allows scholars to be linked directly to a piece of content that is related to the topic but perhaps part of a network outside that scholar's field. A hub does not host its own content or discussions, but aggregates related content from across all of H-Net and provides a window into the particular network where the topic is being discussed. As of April 2020, the following hubs are offered for all to view and to which users can subscribe in order to get notifications via email of new content:\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/digital-humanities-hub Digital Humanities Hub]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/gender-hub Gender Hub]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/race-and-ethnicity-hub Race and Ethnicity Hub]\n\n===H-Net Crossroads===\nCrossroads networks serve as a collaboration between Network Editors on the H-Net Commons who choose to highlight content from across the H-Net Commons as well as to commission new content on a particular subject for a Crossroads network. As of April 2020, the following Crossroads networks are offered for viewing and/or subscription:\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/oah-annual-meeting-crossroads OAH Annual Meeting Crossroads]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/world-cup-2014 World Cup 2014]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/world-war-i-crossroads World War I Crossroads]\n\n===H-Announce===\nH-Announce is an academic announcement service housed on the H-Net Commons.

Over 48,800 reviews of academic titles and other publications have been commissioned, copy edited, and published on the Commons. All reviews are archived and can be searched by author, publisher, title, ISBN, LC card number, reviewer name, date of review, the network that commissioned the review, and keywords. Each published review is sent out to the subscriber base via e-mail notifications through H-Review as well as on the \u201cReviews Tab\u201d on the front page of the Commons.\n\nH-Net set out to create a reviews program that reached out to a wide variety of scholars to participate in conversations that, previously, has only been available to the elites of the profession. The earliest archived review on H-Net is on H-Law and was published in 1993. However, the reviews program was not regularly published until 1995. In 2003, the [[Library of Congress]] began linking H-Net Reviews to the records in the online catalog.<ref name=\":7\"/>\n\nIn a 2005 study comparing H-Net online reviews and print reviews conducted by Eileen L. McGrath, Winifred Fordham Metz, John B. Rutledge, they concluded that there are some significant differences between the demographics of reviews. With the print publications reviewers having a trend of higher education and experience in their fields. However, H-Net reviews still hold validity in the scholarly community and make participating in the field more accessible to younger and less seasoned scholars. In this study they found that there was no major difference between the harshness of the H-Net Reviewers and that of the ''[[Journal of Southern history|Journal of Southern History]]'' (JoSH) reviewers, and that the main difference between the two was the length of review. The H-Net reviewers tended to have reviews three times the length of the print reviews from the same field.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn 2008 the H-Net Reviews program underwent a major update including features such as a new status updating system for tracking where each title is in the reviews process and a multi-layered editing program including two layers of content and copy editing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\"Peter Knupfer|first=H.-Net\" <peter@MAIL H.-NET MSU EDU>|date=2008-10-03|title=From the Executive Director: H-Net's New Reviews Management System|url=https://lists.h-net.org/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx|journal=H-announce}}</ref>\n\n== H-Net Job Guide ==\n'''The H-Net Job Guide''' is an online based job board for academic job postings in the US and abroad. Increasingly, the Job Guide serves the non-academic world of non-profits, government, and NGOs, as well as for-profit companies seeking candidates with specialized training and experience. Jobs posted to the Job Guide are distributed to H-Net's active community of researchers, teachers, and scholarly professionals already collaborating through H-Net's 180+ public networks. Revenue from the H-Net Job Guide recovers the cost of all H-Net's services to the public and supports the work of hundreds of volunteer editors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.h-net.org/jobs/home.php|title=H-Net Job Guide|website=www.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\nFor job seekers, all listings in the Job Guide can be browsed by category along with a few filter options. The Job Guide originated with the majority of the listings being specifically for history, however as it developed over time it began posting a greater variety of social science positions such as: humanities computing, speech, rhetoric/composition, and business. More recently, the Job Guide has begun to incorporate more positions within administration fields and other vocations outside of academia.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Social Media ==\nH-Net Maintains an active social media presence across several platforms and many individual networks manage social media accounts specific to their fields of study.\n\nA selection of the individual networks also maintains social media accounts, the majority of these are involved with Twitter, however, a few have created Facebook pages.\n\n'''All Social Media Accounts'''\n\n[[Facebook]]: H-Net: Humanities and Social Sciences Online, https://www.facebook.com/humanities.socialsciences.online/\n\nMain Twitter: '''@'''HNet_Humanities, https://twitter.com/HNet_Humanities \u00a0\n\nH-Net Book Channel Twitter: '''@'''HNetBookChannel, https://twitter.com/HNetBookChannel\n\nH-Net Reviews Twitter: '''@'''HNet_Reviews, https://twitter.com/HNet_Reviews\n\nH-Net Job Guide Twitter: '''@'''HNetJobGuide, https://twitter.com/HNetJobGuide\n\n[[LinkedIn]]: H-Net: Humanities and Social Sciences Online https://www.linkedin.com/company/h-net-humanities-&-social-sciences-on-line\n\nAll H-Net social media accounts: https://networks.h-net.org/node/513/pages/132236/h-net-social-media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/513/pages/132236/h-net-social-media|title=H-Net Social Media {{!}} H-Net {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\n== H-Net 25 ==\nFounded in 1993, H-Net celebrated its 25th anniversary as an organization in 2018.

H-Net began in the form of a [[LISTSERV]], users could subscribe to groups or \u201clists\u201d and receive notifications in their in-boxes. This platform connected scholars through their in-boxes and made use of the new uses of e-mail. \u00a0\n\nThe earliest lists included: H-Urban, H-Women, H-Holocaust, H-Diplo, H-CivWar, H-Law, H-LatAm, H-South, H-Rural, H-Amstdy, H-Ethnic, H-Albion, H-Teach, H-Judaic, H-OIEAHC (later renamed H-Early-America), H-Film, H-Rhetor, H-Labor, and H-Pol.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/hnet25|title=H-Net 25th Anniversary Crossroads {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> The largest list at the time was HOLOCAUS (later renamed H-Holocaust), with 290 subscribers.\n\nIn 1994, H-Net created its first formal governance structure and elected an executive committee with Richard Jensen as the first Executive Director.

2018 the H-Net Editors worked with the Home Office programmers to launch a new way for users to browse the H-Net Commons to find content of interest outside the networks to which they have subscribed. A hub allows scholars to be linked directly to a piece of content that is related to the topic but perhaps part of a network outside that scholar's field. A hub does not host its own content or discussions, but aggregates related content from across all of H-Net and provides a window into the particular network where the topic is being discussed. As of April 2020, the following hubs are offered for all to view and to which users can subscribe in order to get notifications via email of new content:\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/digital-humanities-hub Digital Humanities Hub]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/gender-hub Gender Hub]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/race-and-ethnicity-hub Race and Ethnicity Hub]\n\n===H-Net Crossroads===\nCrossroads networks serve as a collaboration between Network Editors on the H-Net Commons who choose to highlight content from across the H-Net Commons as well as to commission new content on a particular subject for a Crossroads network. As of April 2020, the following Crossroads networks are offered for viewing and/or subscription:\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/oah-annual-meeting-crossroads OAH Annual Meeting Crossroads]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/world-cup-2014 World Cup 2014]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/world-war-i-crossroads World War I Crossroads]\n\n===H-Announce===\nH-Announce is an academic announcement service housed on the H-Net Commons. Free of charge, any user with an account can submit an announcement as long as it is not a for-profit activity or a book announcement. To see the full H-Announce guidelines, visit here: https://networks.h-net.org/node/905/pages/73385/h-announce-users-guide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/905/pages/73385/h-announce-users-guide|title=H-Announce: A User's Guide {{!}} Help Desk {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> These announcements are moderated by trained H-Net staff and sent out via e-mail notifications. Digests are sent to network editors daily for reposting on their networks.\n\n===H-Net Book Channel===\nThe H-Net Book Channel is a new book discovery service which sorts new academic publications by category in a searchable format. Users can browse the new titles by category on the H-Net Book Channel Home Page: https://networks.h-net.org/h-net-book-channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/h-net-book-channel|title=H-Net Book Channel {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Users can also submit new book announcements with the \u201cUser Submissions\u201d form. You can find this form here: https://networks.h-net.org/book-channel-submission-form <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/book-channel-submission-form|title=Submit a Book Form|website=H-Net Commons}}</ref>\n\n== H-Net Reviews ==\n'''The H-Net Reviews''' program is one of the largest archives of academic reviews online. Over 48,800 reviews of academic titles and other publications have been commissioned, copy edited, and published on the Commons. All reviews are archived and can be searched by author, publisher, title, ISBN, LC card number, reviewer name, date of review, the network that commissioned the review, and keywords. Each published review is sent out to the subscriber base via e-mail notifications through H-Review as well as on the \u201cReviews Tab\u201d on the front page of the Commons.\n\nH-Net set out to create a reviews program that reached out to a wide variety of scholars to participate in conversations that, previously, has only been available to the elites of the profession. The earliest archived review on H-Net is on H-Law and was published in 1993. However, the reviews program was not regularly published until 1995. In 2003, the [[Library of Congress]] began linking H-Net Reviews to the records in the online catalog.<ref name=\":7\"/>\n\nIn a 2005 study comparing H-Net online reviews and print reviews conducted by Eileen L. McGrath, Winifred Fordham Metz, John B. Rutledge, they concluded that there are some significant differences between the demographics of reviews. With the print publications reviewers having a trend of higher education and experience in their fields. However, H-Net reviews still hold validity in the scholarly community and make participating in the field more accessible to younger and less seasoned scholars. In this study they found that there was no major difference between the harshness of the H-Net Reviewers and that of the ''[[Journal of Southern history|Journal of Southern History]]'' (JoSH) reviewers, and that the main difference between the two was the length of review. The H-Net reviewers tended to have reviews three times the length of the print reviews from the same field.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn 2008 the H-Net Reviews program underwent a major update including features such as a new status updating system for tracking where each title is in the reviews process and a multi-layered editing program including two layers of content and copy editing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\"Peter Knupfer|first=H.-Net\" <peter@MAIL H.-NET MSU EDU>|date=2008-10-03|title=From the Executive Director: H-Net's New Reviews Management System|url=https://lists.h-net.org/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx|journal=H-announce}}</ref>\n\n== H-Net Job Guide ==\n'''The H-Net Job Guide''' is an online based job board for academic job postings in the US and abroad. Increasingly, the Job Guide serves the non-academic world of non-profits, government, and NGOs, as well as for-profit companies seeking candidates with specialized training and experience. Jobs posted to the Job Guide are distributed to H-Net's active community of researchers, teachers, and scholarly professionals already collaborating through H-Net's 180+ public networks. Revenue from the H-Net Job Guide recovers the cost of all H-Net's services to the public and supports the work of hundreds of volunteer editors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.h-net.org/jobs/home.php|title=H-Net Job Guide|website=www.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\nFor job seekers, all listings in the Job Guide can be browsed by category along with a few filter options. The Job Guide originated with the majority of the listings being specifically for history, however as it developed over time it began posting a greater variety of social science positions such as: humanities computing, speech, rhetoric/composition, and business. More recently, the Job Guide has begun to incorporate more positions within administration fields and other vocations outside of academia.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Social Media ==\nH-Net Maintains an active social media presence across several platforms and many individual networks manage social media accounts specific to their fields of study.\n\nA selection of the individual networks also maintains social media accounts, the majority of these are involved with Twitter, however, a few have created Facebook pages.\n\n'''All Social Media Accounts'''\n\n[[Facebook]]: H-Net: Humanities and Social Sciences Online, https://www.facebook.com/humanities.socialsciences.online/\n\nMain Twitter: '''@'''HNet_Humanities, https://twitter.com/HNet_Humanities \u00a0\n\nH-Net Book Channel Twitter: '''@'''HNetBookChannel, https://twitter.com/HNetBookChannel\n\nH-Net Reviews Twitter: '''@'''HNet_Reviews, https://twitter.com/HNet_Reviews\n\nH-Net Job Guide Twitter: '''@'''HNetJobGuide, https://twitter.com/HNetJobGuide\n\n[[LinkedIn]]: H-Net: Humanities and Social Sciences Online https://www.linkedin.com/company/h-net-humanities-&-social-sciences-on-line\n\nAll H-Net social media accounts: https://networks.h-net.org/node/513/pages/132236/h-net-social-media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/513/pages/132236/h-net-social-media|title=H-Net Social Media {{!}} H-Net {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\n== H-Net 25 ==\nFounded in 1993, H-Net celebrated its 25th anniversary as an organization in 2018. This included a collection of campaigns across the website and social media all housed on the newly created H-Net 25 Crossroads network. Visit the crossroads here: <nowiki>https://networks.h-net.org/hnet25</nowiki>.<ref name=\":5\" /> On social media the hashtags used to organize content were #ThankYouHNet and #HNet25.\n\nFeatured on the crossroads is a timeline of the networks in the order they were founded, as well as an archival discussion logs project called \u201cMining the Logs,\u201d showcasing some of the more dynamic conversations from the original H-Net lists.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* Andrew McMichael, \"The Historian, the Internet, and the Web: A Reassessment,\" ''Perspectives: The Newsletter of the American Historical Association'', 36: 2 (Feb. 1998). https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/february-1998/the-historian-the-internet-and-the-web-a-reassessment\n*Brennan, Elaine. \u201cHistory Net Lists\u201d.

Sam is a local racing legend who now supports his son's racing in between dating divorcee Becca. Despite being a talented racer, Cam's car doesn't race well due to poor funding. Frustrated for losing the race due to engine issues, Sam's long-time rival, Linsky, offers Cam a chance to join his team with a new car. Cam decides to leave his father to join Linksy as a chance to prove his worth and win races. When Cam tells his father about his choice to join Linsky, Sam is enraged and warns that Linsky is a snake before firing his own son from the garage.\n\nFeeling down from Cam's defection, Sam spends the night drinking his woes away. By the following day, Sam decides to bring himself out of retirement and restore his status as a champion racer. While everyone thinks Sam is crazy to race so late in life, he quickly proves his experience and driving skills are still top notch and wins several races. With Sam reclaiming his title as champion racer, Linsky feels threatened by Sam and wants Cam to crash into Sam's car. Unable to crash into his father, Linsky has another racer stage a crash at the next race. Dunn causes Cam to spin out and Sam crashes into Cam's car onto the side. Although Cam survives his crash, he suffers multiple fractures on his leg and he is out of race for several months.\n\nIn between these six months of recovery, Sam and Cam make peace with each other and Sam learns about Linsky wanting Cam to crash into him. With both cars severely damaged, they need a new car to get back into racing. Throughout this time, Sam has kept the 1970 Mustang that killed his wife. Because of sentimental value, he could never sell it. However, in order to buy a new dirt Late Model for Cam to drive, which costs about $80,000, Sam decides to sell his car to Linsky. Now devoting all his energy into building the new car, the Munroe family pools their efforts into getting the car ready and supports Cam's return to the circuit.\n\nLinsky wants to beat Sam to finally prove who's the better racer; he has to settle with racing Cam instead. During the race, Linsky spins out Cam in the final two laps of the race. Cam manages to restart his car and rallies from the rear of the field over the final two laps (which is quite unlikely) and wins the race. Linsky is denied his victory as Munroe won the race. When commenting about the race with the press, Cam gives credit to Sam and his loving wife for their support. In the aftermath, the Munroes celebrate Cam's daughter's first birthday. Cam has gotten a new apartment to settle the family in and Sam solidifies his relationship with Becca, having finally found happiness and peace with his life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Travolta]] as Sam Munroe\n* [[Shania Twain]] as Becca\n* [[Toby Sebastian]] as Cam Munroe\n* [[Rosabell Laurenti Sellers]] as Cindy (Cam's wife)\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Linsky\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Stumpy\n* [[Buck Taylor]] as Ben\n* [[Luis Da Silva]] as Diner Redneck\n* Margaret Bowman as Martha\n* Gioia Libardoni as Kelly\n* [[Denny M\u00e9ndez]] as Dr. Deena Thompson\n* Chris Mullinax as Jack Dunn\n* [[Red Farmer]] as Ray Miller\n* Jen Baker and Faith Bruner as Track Girls\n* Jonathan Aidan Cockrell as James\n* John Flanagan as Race Car Driver\n* Haley Flanagan as Banquet Dancer\n* [[Audrey Fafard]] as Jenny Monroe\n\n==Response==\n===Box office===\n''Trading Paint'' grossed $0 in the United States and Canada<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Trading-Paint-(2019)#tab=summary |title=''Trading Paint'' (2019) - Financial Information |publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]], Nash Information Services, LLC |accessdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref> and $6,898 in other territories.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film [[List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|holds a critic approval rating of 0%]] based on 12 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 3.81/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/trading_paint |title=''Trading Paint'' (2019) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]].[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 34 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/trading-paint |title=''Trading Paint'' Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]].

Cam decides to leave his father to join Linksy as a chance to prove his worth and win races. When Cam tells his father about his choice to join Linsky, Sam is enraged and warns that Linsky is a snake before firing his own son from the garage.\n\nFeeling down from Cam's defection, Sam spends the night drinking his woes away. By the following day, Sam decides to bring himself out of retirement and restore his status as a champion racer. While everyone thinks Sam is crazy to race so late in life, he quickly proves his experience and driving skills are still top notch and wins several races. With Sam reclaiming his title as champion racer, Linsky feels threatened by Sam and wants Cam to crash into Sam's car. Unable to crash into his father, Linsky has another racer stage a crash at the next race. Dunn causes Cam to spin out and Sam crashes into Cam's car onto the side. Although Cam survives his crash, he suffers multiple fractures on his leg and he is out of race for several months.\n\nIn between these six months of recovery, Sam and Cam make peace with each other and Sam learns about Linsky wanting Cam to crash into him. With both cars severely damaged, they need a new car to get back into racing. Throughout this time, Sam has kept the 1970 Mustang that killed his wife. Because of sentimental value, he could never sell it. However, in order to buy a new dirt Late Model for Cam to drive, which costs about $80,000, Sam decides to sell his car to Linsky. Now devoting all his energy into building the new car, the Munroe family pools their efforts into getting the car ready and supports Cam's return to the circuit.\n\nLinsky wants to beat Sam to finally prove who's the better racer; he has to settle with racing Cam instead. During the race, Linsky spins out Cam in the final two laps of the race. Cam manages to restart his car and rallies from the rear of the field over the final two laps (which is quite unlikely) and wins the race. Linsky is denied his victory as Munroe won the race. When commenting about the race with the press, Cam gives credit to Sam and his loving wife for their support. In the aftermath, the Munroes celebrate Cam's daughter's first birthday. Cam has gotten a new apartment to settle the family in and Sam solidifies his relationship with Becca, having finally found happiness and peace with his life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Travolta]] as Sam Munroe\n* [[Shania Twain]] as Becca\n* [[Toby Sebastian]] as Cam Munroe\n* [[Rosabell Laurenti Sellers]] as Cindy (Cam's wife)\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Linsky\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Stumpy\n* [[Buck Taylor]] as Ben\n* [[Luis Da Silva]] as Diner Redneck\n* Margaret Bowman as Martha\n* Gioia Libardoni as Kelly\n* [[Denny M\u00e9ndez]] as Dr. Deena Thompson\n* Chris Mullinax as Jack Dunn\n* [[Red Farmer]] as Ray Miller\n* Jen Baker and Faith Bruner as Track Girls\n* Jonathan Aidan Cockrell as James\n* John Flanagan as Race Car Driver\n* Haley Flanagan as Banquet Dancer\n* [[Audrey Fafard]] as Jenny Monroe\n\n==Response==\n===Box office===\n''Trading Paint'' grossed $0 in the United States and Canada<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Trading-Paint-(2019)#tab=summary |title=''Trading Paint'' (2019) - Financial Information |publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]], Nash Information Services, LLC |accessdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref> and $6,898 in other territories.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film [[List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|holds a critic approval rating of 0%]] based on 12 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 3.81/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/trading_paint |title=''Trading Paint'' (2019) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]].[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 34 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/trading-paint |title=''Trading Paint'' Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]].

It consisted of three separate battles in the Chinese provinces of [[Henan]], [[Hunan]] and [[Guangxi]].\n\nThese battles were the Japanese '''Operation Kogo''' or [[Battle of Central Henan]], '''Operation Togo 1''' or the [[Battle of Changheng]], and '''Operation Togo 2''' and '''Togo 3''', or the [[Battle of Guilin-Liuzhou]], respectively. The two primary goals of Ichi-go were to open a land route to [[French Indochina]], and capture air bases in southeast China from which American bombers were attacking the Japanese homeland and shipping.<ref>''The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II: China Defensive'', pg. 21</ref>\n\nIn [[Japanese language|Japanese]] the operation was also called '''''Tairiku Dats\u016b Sakusen''''' (\u5927\u9678\u6253\u901a\u4f5c\u6226), or \"Continent Cross-Through Operation\", while the Chinese refer to it as the '''Battle of Henan-Hunan-Guangxi''' ({{zh|t=\u8c6b\u6e58\u6842\u6703\u6230|s=\u8c6b\u6e58\u6842\u4f1a\u6218|p=Y\u00f9 X\u012bang Gu\u00ec Hu\u00eczh\u00e0n}}).\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Japanese mechanized forces marching towards Lo-yang.jpg|thumb|left|1944 Operation Ichigo]]\nThere were two phases to the operation. In the first phase, the Japanese secured the [[Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway|Pinghan Railway]] between [[Beijing]] and Wuhan; in the second, they displaced the US air forces stationed in Hunan province and reached the city of [[Liuzhou]], near the border with Japanese-held [[Indochina]]. 17 divisions, including 500,000 men, 15,000 vehicles, 6,000 artillery pieces, 800 tanks and 100,000 horses participated in this operation.\n\nThe Japanese included [[Kwantung Army]] units and equipment from [[Manchukuo]], mechanized units, units from the North China theater and units from mainland Japan to participate in this campaign. It was the largest land campaign organized by the Japanese during the entire [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Many of the newest American-trained Chinese units and supplies were forcibly locked in the Burmese theater under [[Joseph Stilwell]] set by terms of the Lend-Lease Agreement.\n[[File:1944 Operation Ichigo IJA invaded Henan.jpg|thumb|left|Operation Ichigo, IJA invading Henan, 1944]]\nIn [[Battle of Central Henan|Operation Kogo]], 390,000 Chinese soldiers, led by General [[Tang Enbo]] (\u6e6f\u6069\u4f2f), were deployed to defend the strategic position of [[Luoyang]]. <!-- What does \"strategic position\" mean here? Please clarify.--> The 3rd Tank Division of the IJA crossed the [[Yellow River]] around [[Zhengzhou]] in late April and defeated Chinese forces near [[Xuchang]], then swung around clockwise and besieged Luoyang. Luoyang was defended by three Chinese divisions. The 3rd Tank Division began to attack Luoyang on May 13 and took it on May 25.\n[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|left|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped)]]\nThe second phase of Ichigo began in May, following the success of the first phase. Japanese forces advanced southward and occupied [[Changsha]], [[Hengyang]], [[Guilin]] and [[Liuzhou]]. In December 1944, Japanese forces reached French Indochina and achieved the purpose of the operation. Nevertheless, there were few practical gains from this offensive. US air forces moved inland from the threatened bases near the coast. The operation also forced British Commandos working with the Chinese as part of [[Mission 204]] to leave China and return to Burma. The U.S. [[Fourteenth Air Force]] often disrupted the [[Hunan\u2013Guangxi Railway]] between Hengyang and Liuzhou that had been established in Operation Ichigo. Japan continued to attack airfields where US air forces were stationed up to the spring of 1945.\n\nThe [[XX Bomber Command]] operating Strategic [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 bombers]] of the [[Twentieth Air Force]], which were attacking Japan in [[Operation Matterhorn]], were forced to move as well, but although this affected their efficiency for a short time, in early 1945 the Twentieth Air Force moved to newly established bases in the [[Marianas]] under the command of the newly established [[XXI Bomber Command]]. This nullified the limited protection that the Japanese home islands had received from Operation Ichigo.\n\n===Henan peasants attack Kuomintang forces===\nGeneral [[Jiang Dingwen]] of the First War Zone gave his account of the behavior of Henan civilians: \"During the campaign, the unexpected phenomenon was that the people of the mountains in western Henan attacked our troops, taking guns, bullets, and explosives, and even high-powered mortars and radio equipment... They surrounded our troops and killed our officers. We heard this pretty often. The heads of the villages and baojia (village mutual-responsibility groups) just ran away. At the same time, they took away our stored grain, leaving their houses and fields empty, which meant that our officers and soldiers had no food for many days.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=323\u2013324|quote=|via=}}</ref> This was revenge for the [[1938 Yellow River flood]] and the [[Chinese famine of 1942\u201343]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=271\u2013272, 326|quote=|via=}}</ref> Japanese actions would cause other famines in [[British India]] (The [[1943 Bengal famine|1943 Indian famine]] killed about 4 million indians in [[Bengal]]<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-33618621]</ref>.)

He was able to convince General [[George Marshall]] to have President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] send an ultimatum to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] threatening to end all American aid unless Chiang \"at once\" placed Stilwell \"in unrestricted command of all your forces.\"<ref>Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.446\u2013447</ref>\n\nAn exultant Stilwell immediately delivered this letter to Chiang despite pleas from [[Patrick Hurley]], Roosevelt's special envoy in China, to delay delivering the message and work on a deal that would achieve Stilwell's aim in a manner more acceptable to Chiang.<ref>Lohbeck, Hurley, p.292</ref> Seeing this act as a move toward the complete subjugation and vassalization of China, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] gave a formal reply in which he said that Stilwell must be replaced immediately.<ref>Lohbeck, Hurley, p.298</ref><ref>Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.452</ref>\nAs a result, Stilwell was replaced as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT) by Major General [[Albert Wedemeyer]]. Stilwell's other command responsibilities in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India Theater]] were divided up and allocated to other officers.\n\nAlthough Chiang was successful in removing Stilwell, the public relations damage suffered by his Chinese Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) regime was irreparable. Right before Stilwell's departure, [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] drama critic-turned-war correspondent [[Brooks Atkinson]] interviewed him in [[Chungking]] and wrote:<blockquote>The decision to relieve General Stilwell represents the political triumph of a moribund, anti-democratic regime that is more concerned with maintaining its political supremacy than in driving the Japanese out of China.  The Chinese Communists... have good armies that they are claiming to be fighting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in North China\u2014actually they are covertly or even overtly building themselves up to fight Generalissimo's government forces... The Generalissimo [Chiang Kai-shek] naturally regards these armies as the chief threat to the country and his supremacy... has seen no need to make sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them for the duration of the war... No diplomatic genius could have overcome the Generalissimo's basic unwillingness to risk his armies in battle with the Japanese.<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{cite magazine\n| title      = Crisis\n| url        = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801570-4,00.html\n| magazine  = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine quoting ''[[The New York Times]]''\n| date       = 1944-11-13\n| accessdate = 2007-03-02}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAtkinson, who had visited [[Mao Zedong]] in the communist capital of [[Yenan]], saw his Communist Chinese forces as a democratic movement (after Atkinson visited Mao, his article on his visit was titled ''Yenan: A Chinese Wonderland City''), and the Nationalists in turn as hopelessly reactionary and corrupt. This view was shared by many U.S. journalists in China at the time, but due to pro-Chiang Allied press censorship, it was not as well known to their readers until Stilwell's recall and the ensuing anti-Chiang coverage forced it into the open.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|author1=Knightley, Phillip\n|title=The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Iraq\n|page=303\n|date=2004\n|edition=3rd\n|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]\n|isbn=978-0-8018-8030-8\n|author1-link=Phillip Knightley\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe Japanese successes in Operation Ichi-Go had a limited effect on the war. The U.S. could still bomb the Japanese homeland from [[Saipan]] and other Pacific bases. In the territories seized, Japanese forces controlled only the cities, not their surrounding countryside. The increased size of the occupied territory also thinned out the Japanese lines. A great majority of the Chinese forces were able to retreat out of the area, and later come back to attack Japanese positions. As a result, future Japanese attempts to fight into [[Sichuan]], such as in the [[Battle of West Hunan]], ended in failure. All in all, Japan was not any closer in defeating China after this operation, and the constant defeats the Japanese suffered in the Pacific meant that Japan never got the time and resources needed to achieve final victory over China. The Japanese suffered 11,742 KIAs by mid-November, and the number of soldiers that died of illness was more than twice this.<ref>http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Apeman/20070710/p1</ref><ref>Until mid-November, IJA had a illness toll of 66,000\uff0cand a field hospital had taken in 6164 soldiers, 2,281 of which died due to malnutrition \u9913\u6b7b\u3057\u305f\u82f1\u970a\u305f\u3061 P116</ref><ref>[http://mil.huanqiu.com/history/2013-06/4001059.html In 1944, twice as many Japanese soldiers died of illness as KIA]</ref> The total death toll was about 100,000 by the end of 1944.<ref name=\"\u4e2d\u56fd\u6170\u970a\"/>\n\nOperation Ichi-go created a great sense of social confusion in the areas of China that it affected. Chinese Communist guerrillas were able to exploit this confusion to gain influence and control of greater areas of the countryside in the aftermath of Ichi-go.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R7qNuIJJsNEC&pg=PA162&lpg ''China at War: An Encyclopedia''].

White|Theodore White]], a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent in China at the time of the offensive, was based on an interview with former [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] Major Frank Gleason, who led a demolition group of American soldiers during the offensive that were charged with blowing up anything left behind in the retreat that might be of use to Japan. His group ultimately destroyed over 150 bridges and 50,000 tons of munitions, helping slow the Japanese advance.

It consisted of three separate battles in the Chinese provinces of [[Henan]], [[Hunan]] and [[Guangxi]].\n\nThese battles were the Japanese '''Operation Kogo''' or [[Battle of Central Henan]], '''Operation Togo 1''' or the [[Battle of Changheng]], and '''Operation Togo 2''' and '''Togo 3''', or the [[Battle of Guilin-Liuzhou]], respectively. The two primary goals of Ichi-go were to open a land route to [[French Indochina]], and capture air bases in southeast China from which American bombers were attacking the Japanese homeland and shipping.<ref>''The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II: China Defensive'', pg. 21</ref>\n\nIn [[Japanese language|Japanese]] the operation was also called '''''Tairiku Dats\u016b Sakusen''''' (\u5927\u9678\u6253\u901a\u4f5c\u6226), or \"Continent Cross-Through Operation\", while the Chinese refer to it as the '''Battle of Henan-Hunan-Guangxi''' ({{zh|t=\u8c6b\u6e58\u6842\u6703\u6230|s=\u8c6b\u6e58\u6842\u4f1a\u6218|p=Y\u00f9 X\u012bang Gu\u00ec Hu\u00eczh\u00e0n}}).\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Japanese mechanized forces marching towards Lo-yang.jpg|thumb|left|1944 Operation Ichigo]]\nThere were two phases to the operation. In the first phase, the Japanese secured the [[Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway|Pinghan Railway]] between [[Beijing]] and Wuhan; in the second, they displaced the US air forces stationed in Hunan province and reached the city of [[Liuzhou]], near the border with Japanese-held [[Indochina]]. 17 divisions, including 500,000 men, 15,000 vehicles, 6,000 artillery pieces, 800 tanks and 100,000 horses participated in this operation.\n\nThe Japanese included [[Kwantung Army]] units and equipment from [[Manchukuo]], mechanized units, units from the North China theater and units from mainland Japan to participate in this campaign. It was the largest land campaign organized by the Japanese during the entire [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Many of the newest American-trained Chinese units and supplies were forcibly locked in the Burmese theater under [[Joseph Stilwell]] set by terms of the Lend-Lease Agreement.\n[[File:1944 Operation Ichigo IJA invaded Henan.jpg|thumb|left|Operation Ichigo, IJA invading Henan, 1944]]\nIn [[Battle of Central Henan|Operation Kogo]], 390,000 Chinese soldiers, led by General [[Tang Enbo]] (\u6e6f\u6069\u4f2f), were deployed to defend the strategic position of [[Luoyang]]. <!-- What does \"strategic position\" mean here? Please clarify.--> The 3rd Tank Division of the IJA crossed the [[Yellow River]] around [[Zhengzhou]] in late April and defeated Chinese forces near [[Xuchang]], then swung around clockwise and besieged Luoyang. Luoyang was defended by three Chinese divisions. The 3rd Tank Division began to attack Luoyang on May 13 and took it on May 25.\n[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|left|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped)]]\nThe second phase of Ichigo began in May, following the success of the first phase. Japanese forces advanced southward and occupied [[Changsha]], [[Hengyang]], [[Guilin]] and [[Liuzhou]]. In December 1944, Japanese forces reached French Indochina and achieved the purpose of the operation. Nevertheless, there were few practical gains from this offensive. US air forces moved inland from the threatened bases near the coast. The operation also forced British Commandos working with the Chinese as part of [[Mission 204]] to leave China and return to Burma. The U.S. [[Fourteenth Air Force]] often disrupted the [[Hunan\u2013Guangxi Railway]] between Hengyang and Liuzhou that had been established in Operation Ichigo. Japan continued to attack airfields where US air forces were stationed up to the spring of 1945.\n\nThe [[XX Bomber Command]] operating Strategic [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 bombers]] of the [[Twentieth Air Force]], which were attacking Japan in [[Operation Matterhorn]], were forced to move as well, but although this affected their efficiency for a short time, in early 1945 the Twentieth Air Force moved to newly established bases in the [[Marianas]] under the command of the newly established [[XXI Bomber Command]]. This nullified the limited protection that the Japanese home islands had received from Operation Ichigo.\n\n===Henan peasants attack Kuomintang forces===\nGeneral [[Jiang Dingwen]] of the First War Zone gave his account of the behavior of Henan civilians: \"During the campaign, the unexpected phenomenon was that the people of the mountains in western Henan attacked our troops, taking guns, bullets, and explosives, and even high-powered mortars and radio equipment... They surrounded our troops and killed our officers. We heard this pretty often. The heads of the villages and baojia (village mutual-responsibility groups) just ran away. At the same time, they took away our stored grain, leaving their houses and fields empty, which meant that our officers and soldiers had no food for many days.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=323\u2013324|quote=|via=}}</ref> This was revenge for the [[1938 Yellow River flood]] and the [[Chinese famine of 1942\u201343]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=271\u2013272, 326|quote=|via=}}</ref> General Jiang's account also said: \"Actually this is truly painful for me to say: in the end the damages we suffered from the attacks by the people were more serious than the losses from battles with the enemy.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=324|quote=|via=}}</ref> The Henan peasants picked up the weapons Kuomintang troops had abandoned to defend themselves against the Japanese.<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=325|quote=|via=}}</ref> When the Kuomintang army ordered the Henan locals to destroy the local highways to prevent the Japanese advance, they refused.<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=326|quote=|via=}}</ref> In fact they sometimes even went back at night and mended roads which the army had torn up by day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival|last=Mitter|first=Rana|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-141-03145-3 |location=|pages=326|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the rapid deterioration of the Chinese front after Japanese launched Operation Ichi-Go in 1944, General [[Joseph Stilwell]] saw this as an opportunity to win his political struggle against [[Chiang Kai-shek]], China's leader, and gain full command of all Chinese armed forces. He was able to convince General [[George Marshall]] to have President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] send an ultimatum to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] threatening to end all American aid unless Chiang \"at once\" placed Stilwell \"in unrestricted command of all your forces.\"<ref>Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.446\u2013447</ref>\n\nAn exultant Stilwell immediately delivered this letter to Chiang despite pleas from [[Patrick Hurley]], Roosevelt's special envoy in China, to delay delivering the message and work on a deal that would achieve Stilwell's aim in a manner more acceptable to Chiang.<ref>Lohbeck, Hurley, p.292</ref> Seeing this act as a move toward the complete subjugation and vassalization of China, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] gave a formal reply in which he said that Stilwell must be replaced immediately.<ref>Lohbeck, Hurley, p.298</ref><ref>Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.452</ref>\nAs a result, Stilwell was replaced as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT) by Major General [[Albert Wedemeyer]]. Stilwell's other command responsibilities in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India Theater]] were divided up and allocated to other officers.\n\nAlthough Chiang was successful in removing Stilwell, the public relations damage suffered by his Chinese Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) regime was irreparable. Right before Stilwell's departure, [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] drama critic-turned-war correspondent [[Brooks Atkinson]] interviewed him in [[Chungking]] and wrote:<blockquote>The decision to relieve General Stilwell represents the political triumph of a moribund, anti-democratic regime that is more concerned with maintaining its political supremacy than in driving the Japanese out of China.  The Chinese Communists... have good armies that they are claiming to be fighting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in North China\u2014actually they are covertly or even overtly building themselves up to fight Generalissimo's government forces... The Generalissimo [Chiang Kai-shek] naturally regards these armies as the chief threat to the country and his supremacy... has seen no need to make sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them for the duration of the war... No diplomatic genius could have overcome the Generalissimo's basic unwillingness to risk his armies in battle with the Japanese.<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{cite magazine\n| title      = Crisis\n| url        = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801570-4,00.html\n| magazine  = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine quoting ''[[The New York Times]]''\n| date       = 1944-11-13\n| accessdate = 2007-03-02}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAtkinson, who had visited [[Mao Zedong]] in the communist capital of [[Yenan]], saw his Communist Chinese forces as a democratic movement (after Atkinson visited Mao, his article on his visit was titled ''Yenan: A Chinese Wonderland City''), and the Nationalists in turn as hopelessly reactionary and corrupt. This view was shared by many U.S. journalists in China at the time, but due to pro-Chiang Allied press censorship, it was not as well known to their readers until Stilwell's recall and the ensuing anti-Chiang coverage forced it into the open.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|author1=Knightley, Phillip\n|title=The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Iraq\n|page=303\n|date=2004\n|edition=3rd\n|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]\n|isbn=978-0-8018-8030-8\n|author1-link=Phillip Knightley\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe Japanese successes in Operation Ichi-Go had a limited effect on the war. The U.S. could still bomb the Japanese homeland from [[Saipan]] and other Pacific bases. In the territories seized, Japanese forces controlled only the cities, not their surrounding countryside. The increased size of the occupied territory also thinned out the Japanese lines. A great majority of the Chinese forces were able to retreat out of the area, and later come back to attack Japanese positions. As a result, future Japanese attempts to fight into [[Sichuan]], such as in the [[Battle of West Hunan]], ended in failure. All in all, Japan was not any closer in defeating China after this operation, and the constant defeats the Japanese suffered in the Pacific meant that Japan never got the time and resources needed to achieve final victory over China. The Japanese suffered 11,742 KIAs by mid-November, and the number of soldiers that died of illness was more than twice this.<ref>http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Apeman/20070710/p1</ref><ref>Until mid-November, IJA had a illness toll of 66,000\uff0cand a field hospital had taken in 6164 soldiers, 2,281 of which died due to malnutrition \u9913\u6b7b\u3057\u305f\u82f1\u970a\u305f\u3061 P116</ref><ref>[http://mil.huanqiu.com/history/2013-06/4001059.html In 1944, twice as many Japanese soldiers died of illness as KIA]</ref> The total death toll was about 100,000 by the end of 1944.<ref name=\"\u4e2d\u56fd\u6170\u970a\"/>\n\nOperation Ichi-go created a great sense of social confusion in the areas of China that it affected. Chinese Communist guerrillas were able to exploit this confusion to gain influence and control of greater areas of the countryside in the aftermath of Ichi-go.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R7qNuIJJsNEC&pg=PA162&lpg ''China at War: An Encyclopedia''].

His father was a clerk in the Kedah State Service and his mother a homemaker Zainuddin Affan & Hasimah Hassan.  Daim received his early education at the Malay Primary School in Seberang Perak, Alor Setar and then advanced to the Special Malay Class at the Sultan Abdul Hamid College, which was an English\u2013medium school.\n\n==Educations==\nBeing a youth of the 40s, during a period when the British Colonial Policy encouraged Malays to attend Malay schools, when Malay parents worried about the possible influence of an English education on their children's religious faith and cultural identity, Daim and his parents were able to transcend these limitations.  In fact, his broad-minded parents enrolled all their children at English\u2013medium schools as they did not want their children to become \"better farmers and fishermen\". However, Daim was very much an absentee student.  He had worked out a strategic studying method whereby he would only need to focus on subjects that he would need to pass to advance to the next class and that required little effort \u2013 English and Malay languages and Mathematics.  He devoted his free time to pursuing his main interest which was sports and more sports.\n\nCareer-wise, Daim would have ended up as a teacher except that due to some miscommunication he had been totally unaware that his name was on the list of successful candidates for Brinsford College, England, a teacher training college.\n\nThroughout his youth, he was very much encouraged by a mother who wanted him to further his studies and a father who wanted him to become a lawyer. His mother sold some land to raise money for him to study law in England. Realizing that \"time is money\", the former absentee student became a diligent and disciplined scholar in law who after eighteen months at Lincoln's Inn London and at the youthful age of 21, was called to the English Bar in 1959. It was also during his student days in London that he developed his voracious appetite for reading which till today is his favourite pastime.\n \nIn 2019, Daim at the age of 81 after retirement, working on the thesis regarding the [[New Economic Policy]] for 11 years finally obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree from [[Universiti Malaya]] (UM).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/10/12/phd-for-daim-zainuddin-on-the-new-economic-policy/|date=October 13, 2010|author=|work=[[Bernama]]|publisher=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|title=PhD for Daim Zainuddin on the New Economic Policy|accessdate=November 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nUpon his return to Malaysia from England after his studies, he started reading in the chambers of Pillai & Co. and later, the chambers of Shearn Delamore which was then the largest law firm in Kuala Lumpur. In 1961, he decided to move and work in [[Kota Bharu]], [[Kelantan]] under the tutelage of Encik Wan Mustaffa who was legal adviser to the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PMIP) which later became known as [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|Parti Islam Se-Malaysia]] (PAS).  After his stint in Kota Bharu, he joined the Malaysian Civil Service as a Magistrate, then became the President of the Sessions Court in Johor and subsequently became Deputy Public Prosecutor in [[Ipoh]], [[Perak]].  He resigned from the service in 1965, returned to Kuala Lumpur and joined the law firm of Allen & Gledhill for the next three years till his resignation in 1968 to start his own law practice of Daim & Gamany. In 1969, however, he decided to venture into business.\n\n==Business==\nHis first business venture was in salt production, partly because it seemed easy and partly because his partner's [[feng shui]] indicated that he should work with water. They went to [[Thailand]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Japan]] to study salt production, weather forecast, soil condition and location. During the start-up they proceeded to clear {{convert|600|acre|km2}} of the coastal land of [[Kuala Selangor]], but because the rain came unseasonably early just when the salt had begun to crystallise, they were almost bankrupted by it.\n\nDaim's great break was in 1971, when he decided to venture into land and property development.  Together with two other partners, he formed a company, Syarikat Maluri Sdn Bhd of which he held a 60% majority control. The Company bought and developed [[Taman Bukit Maluri]], [[Kepong]] and Daim became the first full-fledged Malay property developer in Kuala Lumpur.  Having ventured into a predominantly Chinese sector, he might have expected to encounter insurmountable problems, but he did not, because it was 1971 that the then [[Tun Abdul Razak|Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak]] introduced the [[New Economic Policy (Malaysia)|New Economic Policy]] that was an ambitious and controversial socio-economic restructuring affirmative action program. The NEP targeted a 30% share of the economy for the [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]]. Hence, being only a handful of Bumiputeras involved in this sector, Daim naturally gained advantages from the Government over his Chinese counterparts.\n\nHis next venture was in plastics production.  After he obtained a license however, another two licenses were issued and this instigated early and keen competition to Daim's fledgling company.  Furthermore, the workers were incited to strike and eventually the venture proved to be another bankrupting business.  Fortunately, his other downstream ventures which included the plastic packaging company, Daibochi and the snack food factory, Sedap Food flourished and were later listed on the [[Bursa Malaysia|Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange]] (KLSE).  He also invested in the Ports' downstream business with stevedoring, forwarding and low-loader licenses and had set up a manufacturing plant making steel and iron products like manhole covers and telephone posts. The success of these ventures helped towards offsetting loans and borrowings of the failed venture.\nAfter gaining a foothold in the property business, he began to look for other challenges to pursue and to prove that a Malaysian of Malay ethnicity could succeed in other fields. At the same time, other corporate and political stars were rising and Daim wanted to be \"the Malay to do it\" and so, he forged ahead and bought a 30% equity interest in United Estates Project (UEP) now known as Sime Darby\u2013UEP (developer of the popular '[[Subang Jaya]]' township) and went on picking up stakes in the share market, mostly strategic rather than controlling stakes.\n\nHe was willing to take risks but also saw opportunities before others.  When President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] of France came into power and decided to nationalise all French banks, Daim saw an opportunity whilst others were grumbling about the new socialist policies.  He knew that Malaysian banking regulations did not allow for government-owned banks to operate in Malaysia and therefore knew that Bank Indo-Suez will either have to close its operations in Malaysia or be sold-off.  He wrote a 'cold-call' letter to the chairman/President of the Bank registering his interest in the event that they would want to sell.  Of course rather than closing down the Bank they decided to sell to Daim and in 1981 he became the owner of Indo-Suez later renamed the Malaysian-French Bank.  Later when United Malayan Banking Corporation (then the 2nd largest bank in Malaysia) became available, he exchanged his majority stake in Malaysian-French Bank for a smaller stake in this larger bank.\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1984 he was appointed Minister of Finance.  He never lost his love for the banking industry and after he retired he started investing in small banks overseas in Europe and Africa.  As the business expanded, the banks needed to be organised under a bigger parent bank and he therefore acquired Hock Hua Bank (which he renamed International Bank of Malaysia Berhad) which was one of the smallest banks in Malaysia.  Again he had to dispose of his stake when he was reappointed Minister of Finance in 1998.  After his second retirement he is now again actively involved in the banking industry.\n\nApart from business, politics have always interested Daim. His earliest exposure was as a student in London whereby though not actively involved in politics, he shared his fellow students interests in the political issues of the day particularly independence and post-independence implications on the socio\u2013economic and religious mosaic of pluralistic Malaysia.\n\nHis first encounter with real politics albeit covertly was when in 1966, as a lawyer with Allen & Gledhill, the firm was appointed by the Federal Government of Malaysia to act for the Governor of Sarawak in a case against the Chief Minister of that State. Back in Kuala Lumpur, Daim was asked to attend a Cabinet meeting whereat he briefed the Cabinet members of the political situation in Sarawak and impressed upon the Cabinet the need for emergency to be declared to avert a worsening of the situation caused by the demonstrations against the Chief Minister's minority government. Emergency was declared.  However, the security risk persisted and the Governor as advised by the central government suspended the Standing Orders of the House and called for a meeting of the Assembly using emergency powers. Daim assisted in drafting the statement of the Governor that the Assembly was to debate; the Assembly met, the Chief Minister's government was voted out of office. Impressed by his legal skills and political knowledge, the Prime Minister offered Daim a seat in Sungai Petani in the 1974 general elections but Daim declined, choosing instead to establish his credentials in business.\n\nCome 1977, Daim decided that he was financially comfortable enough to retire. His retirement plan then was to go back to school and so he enrolled at University of California Berkeley to pursue a course in Urban Planning. At around the same time, he enjoyed a close rapport with the then [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]].\n\nIn 1978, Daim met Mahathir in Los Angeles and San Francisco, when Mahathir urged Daim to return to Malaysia and contest in the general election that year. At the same time, Daim was also offered the Chairmanship of the Urban Development Authority (UDA) by the Public Enterprises Minister. Daim was not interested in taking up the Chairmanship of UDA which he deemed too big and widespread, too bureaucratic and doing too many things at the same time. Instead he suggested that UDA should form a holding company and transfer all its commercial property and commercial assets to it; only then would be agree to manage it. Hence, Peremba was established and Daim became its non-executive chairman with a team of young and bright hand\u2013picked officers assisting him. While not many could take his punishing rigours and demands of work and discipline, those who did went on to become successful entrepreneurs and notable amongst these were Tan Sri Wan Azmi Bin Wan Hamzah, Tan Sri Halim Bin Saad, and Tan Sri Samsuddin Bin Abu Hassan. In 1980, Daim was informed that the Prime Minister [[Hussein Onn|Tun Hussein Onn]] had appointed him as Senator in the Upper House of Parliament.\n\nWhen Mahathir became Prime Minister in 1981, he sent Daim on a number of missions. The first was to the [[United States of America]] (USA) to deal with the problem posed by the USA's General Services Administration (GSA) tin stockpile releases which caused the price of tin to tumble, thus adversely affecting the Malaysian tin industry, it being a major producer of tin. Knowing that the tin miners' hardship would not move the Americans but that the communist threat would, Daim decided to take on this hard line in his negotiations with them. It worked and the GSA agreed to limit their stockpile releases to 3,000 tonnes a year for three years.\n\nIn 1981, the [[Government of Malaysia]] announced the adoption of the 'Buy British last' policy which actually was a culmination of a series of problems with the United Kingdom (UK). Prevalent was a new spirit of Malaysian nationalism which was manifested in the acquisition of Guthrie Estate by Permodalan Nasional Berhad, the Government\u2013owned national equity corporation; the return of Seri Carcosa (premises which had been given to the British by [[Tunku Abdul Rahman|Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al\u2013Haj]], Malaysia's first Prime Minister;) and the steep hike in fees of British Universities. To this day, very few Malaysians are aware that Daim was instrumental in working behind the scenes to resolve these issues and restore good relations with the British.\n\nHowever, the event that truly launched Daim's political career was the day before nominations for the 1982 General Elections, when Mahathir rang Daim to say that he was to contest the Kuala Muda Parliamentary seat. Within the short span of the next two years, his rise in politics was meteoric as he was appointed the Minister of Finance in 1984. At that same time the burgeoning economy kept up its momentum despite the high rate of borrowing and spending to keep the economy healthy. The full impact of the world recession on Malaysia was only felt in 1985. Internally too, there were many abuses involving the financial institutions brought about by lack of proper supervision and control. By the time he took over, Daim could not avert the scandals, crisis and failures. However, Daim set about implementing a strict code of monetary and financial management to prevent the disease from becoming terminal for the whole economy.\n\nHe stopped the practice of borrowing to beef up funds for spending, he curtailed expenditure to suit income, he slashed the allocation for the public sector \u2013 upsetting many quarters. In the years 1987, 1988 and 1989, Malaysia paid off about RM6.8 billion of her foreign debts which was earlier than scheduled, a record repayment for developing nations. The Far Eastern Economic Review, which had made dire predictions about Malaysia's economy in 1986, admitted in its issue of 1 September 1988 that Daim's effective management style had contributed positively and tremendously to Malaysia's economic recovery.\n\nDaim resigned as Finance Minister in March 1991, and the news caused a stir both in Malaysia and abroad because it was not in the Malaysian culture to resign from a high office. Therefore, when it happened there was a great deal of speculation as to why, and of course the most prominent was that which cited the irreconcilable differences with the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]], Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. For Daim, the reason was that he had accomplished his tasks \u2013 reorganised and improved the country's financial position. Further, the Prime Minister reiterated by saying that \"Daim had agreed to take the post on condition that he stay only to help reorganize and improve the country's financial position. He said he had fulfilled this task and it was time I let him go.\" In accepting his resignation, the Prime Minister also welcomed his readiness to contribute his ideas to the nation. To crown it all, the Prime Minister recommended Daim for the \"Tun\" title \u2013 the highest honour of the land. And so on 5 June 1991, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] [[Sultan Azlan Shah]] conferred on Daim the [[Seri Setia Mahkota]] award, which carries the title \"Tun\".\n\nPrior to his resignation, in 1991, Daim's contribution was succinctly summed up as thus: \u201cDespite having much of his tenure clouded in controversy, the outgoing Finance Minister has nonetheless earned the reputation as one of the country\u2019s ablest economic architects, having steered Malaysia through recession into four straight years of high growth.\u201d In another article, \u201cDaim exits office having earned the distinction of being a hard\u2013driving technocrat, who resisted pressure by rival ministers who wanted to alter fiscal policy for political expediency \u2026.\u201d\n\nIt was also recognised that during his tenure as the Finance Minister, Daim had implemented four broad strategic structural reforms during the 1986 to 1991 period namely the mobilisation of the private sector, active external policies, the supportive role of the private sector and the rehabilitation of the public enterprises. To this day, the tenets of his economic policies are held in high esteem and are continually pursued to either jump start or sustain the Malaysian economy.\n\nAlthough technically out of the Government, Daim was still perceived as a man to be reckoned with \u2013 an entity greater than the sum of his overt responsibilities when he was appointed Economic Advisor to the Government, Chairman of the Northern Growth Triangle, the Labuan Development Authority and the Langkawi development Authority and also the Treasurer of the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), the leading party in Malaysia's ruling coalition, [[Barisan Nasional]] (National Front). He was also Malaysia's representative to the East Asean Growth Area (EAGA).\n\nIn 1997 when the Asian crisis swept through Asia leaving behind devastated economics in its wake, Daim Zainuddin was recalled to public service.\n\nOn 5 May 2018, Daim was sacked from UMNO together with party veterans; [[Rafidah Aziz]] and [[Rais Yatim]] for supporting [[Mahathir Mohamad]] and opposition [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/umno-sacks-two-ex-ministers-for-backing-opposition/|accessdate=7 May 2018|agency=[[New Strait Times]]|title=Malaysia

'''Abdul Daim bin Zainuddin''' ([[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645 \u0628\u0646 \u0632\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646{{lrm}}; born 29 April 1938 in [[Alor Setar]], [[Kedah]]) is a Malaysian politician, businessman and former [[Minister of Finance (Malaysia)|Finance Minister of Malaysia]] from 1984 to 1991.\n\n==Early life==\nDaim bin Zainuddin is the youngest of thirteen siblings.  His father was a clerk in the Kedah State Service and his mother a homemaker Zainuddin Affan & Hasimah Hassan.  Daim received his early education at the Malay Primary School in Seberang Perak, Alor Setar and then advanced to the Special Malay Class at the Sultan Abdul Hamid College, which was an English\u2013medium school.\n\n==Educations==\nBeing a youth of the 40s, during a period when the British Colonial Policy encouraged Malays to attend Malay schools, when Malay parents worried about the possible influence of an English education on their children's religious faith and cultural identity, Daim and his parents were able to transcend these limitations.  In fact, his broad-minded parents enrolled all their children at English\u2013medium schools as they did not want their children to become \"better farmers and fishermen\". However, Daim was very much an absentee student.  He had worked out a strategic studying method whereby he would only need to focus on subjects that he would need to pass to advance to the next class and that required little effort \u2013 English and Malay languages and Mathematics.  He devoted his free time to pursuing his main interest which was sports and more sports.\n\nCareer-wise, Daim would have ended up as a teacher except that due to some miscommunication he had been totally unaware that his name was on the list of successful candidates for Brinsford College, England, a teacher training college.\n\nThroughout his youth, he was very much encouraged by a mother who wanted him to further his studies and a father who wanted him to become a lawyer. His mother sold some land to raise money for him to study law in England. Realizing that \"time is money\", the former absentee student became a diligent and disciplined scholar in law who after eighteen months at Lincoln's Inn London and at the youthful age of 21, was called to the English Bar in 1959. It was also during his student days in London that he developed his voracious appetite for reading which till today is his favourite pastime.\n \nIn 2019, Daim at the age of 81 after retirement, working on the thesis regarding the [[New Economic Policy]] for 11 years finally obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree from [[Universiti Malaya]] (UM).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/10/12/phd-for-daim-zainuddin-on-the-new-economic-policy/|date=October 13, 2010|author=|work=[[Bernama]]|publisher=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|title=PhD for Daim Zainuddin on the New Economic Policy|accessdate=November 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nUpon his return to Malaysia from England after his studies, he started reading in the chambers of Pillai & Co. and later, the chambers of Shearn Delamore which was then the largest law firm in Kuala Lumpur. In 1961, he decided to move and work in [[Kota Bharu]], [[Kelantan]] under the tutelage of Encik Wan Mustaffa who was legal adviser to the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PMIP) which later became known as [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|Parti Islam Se-Malaysia]] (PAS).  After his stint in Kota Bharu, he joined the Malaysian Civil Service as a Magistrate, then became the President of the Sessions Court in Johor and subsequently became Deputy Public Prosecutor in [[Ipoh]], [[Perak]].  He resigned from the service in 1965, returned to Kuala Lumpur and joined the law firm of Allen & Gledhill for the next three years till his resignation in 1968 to start his own law practice of Daim & Gamany. In 1969, however, he decided to venture into business.\n\n==Business==\nHis first business venture was in salt production, partly because it seemed easy and partly because his partner's [[feng shui]] indicated that he should work with water. They went to [[Thailand]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Japan]] to study salt production, weather forecast, soil condition and location. During the start-up they proceeded to clear {{convert|600|acre|km2}} of the coastal land of [[Kuala Selangor]], but because the rain came unseasonably early just when the salt had begun to crystallise, they were almost bankrupted by it.\n\nDaim's great break was in 1971, when he decided to venture into land and property development.  Together with two other partners, he formed a company, Syarikat Maluri Sdn Bhd of which he held a 60% majority control. The Company bought and developed [[Taman Bukit Maluri]], [[Kepong]] and Daim became the first full-fledged Malay property developer in Kuala Lumpur.  Having ventured into a predominantly Chinese sector, he might have expected to encounter insurmountable problems, but he did not, because it was 1971 that the then [[Tun Abdul Razak|Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak]] introduced the [[New Economic Policy (Malaysia)|New Economic Policy]] that was an ambitious and controversial socio-economic restructuring affirmative action program. The NEP targeted a 30% share of the economy for the [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]]. Hence, being only a handful of Bumiputeras involved in this sector, Daim naturally gained advantages from the Government over his Chinese counterparts.\n\nHis next venture was in plastics production.  After he obtained a license however, another two licenses were issued and this instigated early and keen competition to Daim's fledgling company.  Furthermore, the workers were incited to strike and eventually the venture proved to be another bankrupting business.  Fortunately, his other downstream ventures which included the plastic packaging company, Daibochi and the snack food factory, Sedap Food flourished and were later listed on the [[Bursa Malaysia|Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange]] (KLSE).  He also invested in the Ports' downstream business with stevedoring, forwarding and low-loader licenses and had set up a manufacturing plant making steel and iron products like manhole covers and telephone posts. The success of these ventures helped towards offsetting loans and borrowings of the failed venture.\nAfter gaining a foothold in the property business, he began to look for other challenges to pursue and to prove that a Malaysian of Malay ethnicity could succeed in other fields. At the same time, other corporate and political stars were rising and Daim wanted to be \"the Malay to do it\" and so, he forged ahead and bought a 30% equity interest in United Estates Project (UEP) now known as Sime Darby\u2013UEP (developer of the popular '[[Subang Jaya]]' township) and went on picking up stakes in the share market, mostly strategic rather than controlling stakes.\n\nHe was willing to take risks but also saw opportunities before others.  When President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] of France came into power and decided to nationalise all French banks, Daim saw an opportunity whilst others were grumbling about the new socialist policies.  He knew that Malaysian banking regulations did not allow for government-owned banks to operate in Malaysia and therefore knew that Bank Indo-Suez will either have to close its operations in Malaysia or be sold-off.  He wrote a 'cold-call' letter to the chairman/President of the Bank registering his interest in the event that they would want to sell.  Of course rather than closing down the Bank they decided to sell to Daim and in 1981 he became the owner of Indo-Suez later renamed the Malaysian-French Bank.  Later when United Malayan Banking Corporation (then the 2nd largest bank in Malaysia) became available, he exchanged his majority stake in Malaysian-French Bank for a smaller stake in this larger bank.\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1984 he was appointed Minister of Finance.  He never lost his love for the banking industry and after he retired he started investing in small banks overseas in Europe and Africa.  As the business expanded, the banks needed to be organised under a bigger parent bank and he therefore acquired Hock Hua Bank (which he renamed International Bank of Malaysia Berhad) which was one of the smallest banks in Malaysia.  Again he had to dispose of his stake when he was reappointed Minister of Finance in 1998.  After his second retirement he is now again actively involved in the banking industry.\n\nApart from business, politics have always interested Daim. His earliest exposure was as a student in London whereby though not actively involved in politics, he shared his fellow students interests in the political issues of the day particularly independence and post-independence implications on the socio\u2013economic and religious mosaic of pluralistic Malaysia.\n\nHis first encounter with real politics albeit covertly was when in 1966, as a lawyer with Allen & Gledhill, the firm was appointed by the Federal Government of Malaysia to act for the Governor of Sarawak in a case against the Chief Minister of that State. Back in Kuala Lumpur, Daim was asked to attend a Cabinet meeting whereat he briefed the Cabinet members of the political situation in Sarawak and impressed upon the Cabinet the need for emergency to be declared to avert a worsening of the situation caused by the demonstrations against the Chief Minister's minority government. Emergency was declared.  However, the security risk persisted and the Governor as advised by the central government suspended the Standing Orders of the House and called for a meeting of the Assembly using emergency powers. Daim assisted in drafting the statement of the Governor that the Assembly was to debate; the Assembly met, the Chief Minister's government was voted out of office. Impressed by his legal skills and political knowledge, the Prime Minister offered Daim a seat in Sungai Petani in the 1974 general elections but Daim declined, choosing instead to establish his credentials in business.\n\nCome 1977, Daim decided that he was financially comfortable enough to retire. His retirement plan then was to go back to school and so he enrolled at University of California Berkeley to pursue a course in Urban Planning. At around the same time, he enjoyed a close rapport with the then [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]].\n\nIn 1978, Daim met Mahathir in Los Angeles and San Francisco, when Mahathir urged Daim to return to Malaysia and contest in the general election that year. At the same time, Daim was also offered the Chairmanship of the Urban Development Authority (UDA) by the Public Enterprises Minister. Daim was not interested in taking up the Chairmanship of UDA which he deemed too big and widespread, too bureaucratic and doing too many things at the same time. Instead he suggested that UDA should form a holding company and transfer all its commercial property and commercial assets to it; only then would be agree to manage it. Hence, Peremba was established and Daim became its non-executive chairman with a team of young and bright hand\u2013picked officers assisting him. While not many could take his punishing rigours and demands of work and discipline, those who did went on to become successful entrepreneurs and notable amongst these were Tan Sri Wan Azmi Bin Wan Hamzah, Tan Sri Halim Bin Saad, and Tan Sri Samsuddin Bin Abu Hassan. In 1980, Daim was informed that the Prime Minister [[Hussein Onn|Tun Hussein Onn]] had appointed him as Senator in the Upper House of Parliament.\n\nWhen Mahathir became Prime Minister in 1981, he sent Daim on a number of missions. The first was to the [[United States of America]] (USA) to deal with the problem posed by the USA's General Services Administration (GSA) tin stockpile releases which caused the price of tin to tumble, thus adversely affecting the Malaysian tin industry, it being a major producer of tin. Knowing that the tin miners' hardship would not move the Americans but that the communist threat would, Daim decided to take on this hard line in his negotiations with them. It worked and the GSA agreed to limit their stockpile releases to 3,000 tonnes a year for three years.\n\nIn 1981, the [[Government of Malaysia]] announced the adoption of the 'Buy British last' policy which actually was a culmination of a series of problems with the United Kingdom (UK). Prevalent was a new spirit of Malaysian nationalism which was manifested in the acquisition of Guthrie Estate by Permodalan Nasional Berhad, the Government\u2013owned national equity corporation; the return of Seri Carcosa (premises which had been given to the British by [[Tunku Abdul Rahman|Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al\u2013Haj]], Malaysia's first Prime Minister;) and the steep hike in fees of British Universities. To this day, very few Malaysians are aware that Daim was instrumental in working behind the scenes to resolve these issues and restore good relations with the British.\n\nHowever, the event that truly launched Daim's political career was the day before nominations for the 1982 General Elections, when Mahathir rang Daim to say that he was to contest the Kuala Muda Parliamentary seat. Within the short span of the next two years, his rise in politics was meteoric as he was appointed the Minister of Finance in 1984. At that same time the burgeoning economy kept up its momentum despite the high rate of borrowing and spending to keep the economy healthy. The full impact of the world recession on Malaysia was only felt in 1985. Internally too, there were many abuses involving the financial institutions brought about by lack of proper supervision and control. By the time he took over, Daim could not avert the scandals, crisis and failures. However, Daim set about implementing a strict code of monetary and financial management to prevent the disease from becoming terminal for the whole economy.\n\nHe stopped the practice of borrowing to beef up funds for spending, he curtailed expenditure to suit income, he slashed the allocation for the public sector \u2013 upsetting many quarters. In the years 1987, 1988 and 1989, Malaysia paid off about RM6.8 billion of her foreign debts which was earlier than scheduled, a record repayment for developing nations. The Far Eastern Economic Review, which had made dire predictions about Malaysia's economy in 1986, admitted in its issue of 1 September 1988 that Daim's effective management style had contributed positively and tremendously to Malaysia's economic recovery.\n\nDaim resigned as Finance Minister in March 1991, and the news caused a stir both in Malaysia and abroad because it was not in the Malaysian culture to resign from a high office. Therefore, when it happened there was a great deal of speculation as to why, and of course the most prominent was that which cited the irreconcilable differences with the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]], Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. For Daim, the reason was that he had accomplished his tasks \u2013 reorganised and improved the country's financial position. Further, the Prime Minister reiterated by saying that \"Daim had agreed to take the post on condition that he stay only to help reorganize and improve the country's financial position. He said he had fulfilled this task and it was time I let him go.\" In accepting his resignation, the Prime Minister also welcomed his readiness to contribute his ideas to the nation. To crown it all, the Prime Minister recommended Daim for the \"Tun\" title \u2013 the highest honour of the land. And so on 5 June 1991, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] [[Sultan Azlan Shah]] conferred on Daim the [[Seri Setia Mahkota]] award, which carries the title \"Tun\".\n\nPrior to his resignation, in 1991, Daim's contribution was succinctly summed up as thus: \u201cDespite having much of his tenure clouded in controversy, the outgoing Finance Minister has nonetheless earned the reputation as one of the country\u2019s ablest economic architects, having steered Malaysia through recession into four straight years of high growth.\u201d In another article, \u201cDaim exits office having earned the distinction of being a hard\u2013driving technocrat, who resisted pressure by rival ministers who wanted to alter fiscal policy for political expediency \u2026.\u201d\n\nIt was also recognised that during his tenure as the Finance Minister, Daim had implemented four broad strategic structural reforms during the 1986 to 1991 period namely the mobilisation of the private sector, active external policies, the supportive role of the private sector and the rehabilitation of the public enterprises. To this day, the tenets of his economic policies are held in high esteem and are continually pursued to either jump start or sustain the Malaysian economy.\n\nAlthough technically out of the Government, Daim was still perceived as a man to be reckoned with \u2013 an entity greater than the sum of his overt responsibilities when he was appointed Economic Advisor to the Government, Chairman of the Northern Growth Triangle, the Labuan Development Authority and the Langkawi development Authority and also the Treasurer of the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), the leading party in Malaysia's ruling coalition, [[Barisan Nasional]] (National Front). He was also Malaysia's representative to the East Asean Growth Area (EAGA).\n\nIn 1997 when the Asian crisis swept through Asia leaving behind devastated economics in its wake, Daim Zainuddin was recalled to public service.\n\nOn 5 May 2018, Daim was sacked from UMNO together with party veterans; [[Rafidah Aziz]] and [[Rais Yatim]] for supporting [[Mahathir Mohamad]] and opposition [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/umno-sacks-two-ex-ministers-for-backing-opposition/|accessdate=7 May 2018|agency=[[New Strait Times]]|title=Malaysia

In the [[2012\u201313 escalation of the Syrian Civil War|mid-2012 to late 2013 escalation phase]], their numbers grew, but they were still far outnumbered by Syrian resistance fighters (only around twelve hundred foreign anti-government jihadists were killed in Syria in 2013).<ref name=\"fb\"/> [[Inter-rebel conflict during the Syrian Civil War|Throughout 2014]], with the rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], the [[Al-Nusra Front]], and other groups, their numbers drastically increased and they partnered with and absorbed Syrian rebel groups, both jihadist and non-jihadist. By 2015, foreign jihadists outnumbered Syrian jihadists and other rebels in casualty rolls (16,212 anti-government foreign jihadists were killed in 2015 compared to 7,798 Syrian anti-government rebels killed that same year), a trend that carried over into 2016 (13,297 foreign jihadists and 8,170 Syrian rebels), and 2017 (7,494 foreign jihadists and 6,452 Syrian rebels). By 2018, the proportion of foreign fighters had far decreased (following heavy losses in the bloody battles of 2015-2017 and various interventions by foreign military forces), and Syrian rebels were once again the majority of anti-government casualties (2,746 foreign jihadists killed compared to 5,852 Syrian rebels).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151231195408/http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=41779 Syria is still bleeding \u2026 more than 55,000 thousand persons were killed during the year of 2015.]</ref><ref>[http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=58114 About 60 thousand were killed in 2016 and we still wait for an international trial for the criminals.]</ref><ref>[http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=81564  2017\u2026the year of the military change and the rise of the regime and its allies to head the list of military powers and influences followed by the SDF\u2026and the loss of the opposition and the organization to large spaces of their controlled areas.]</ref><ref>[http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=111056 2018 under different titles\u2026the death of about 23,000 persons, the displacement of hundreds of thousands others, shifts in the influence of the conflicting powers, and regional and international agreements of de-escalation and withdrawal].</ref> Fighters include those from the Gulf Arab states, Tunisia (following its own [[Tunisian revolution]]), Libya (following the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Civil War]]), China, other Arab states, Russia, including the North Caucasus region, and Western countries.<ref name=\"Cerwyn Moore 2017\">Mark Youngman and Cerwyn Moore (2017) \u2018Russian-Speaking\u2019 Fighters in Syria, Iraq and at Home: Consequences and Context'</ref> Over 600 foreign fighters were killed in the first half of 2013 alone.<ref name=\"fb\"/>  According to the [[Syrian Arab Army]], by September 2014 a total of 54,000 foreign jihadists had come to fight, with the largest groups being [[Chechens]] from [[Russia]] (14,000), Saudi Arabians (12,000), Lebanese (9,000), Iraqis, and Tunisians.<ref name=\"bbc.com\">Mohanad Hashim.

Several hundred come from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia. Many of the recruits were [[Salafi]]sts and, though denied by some Salafist leaders, [[Re\u0161ad Plojovi\u0107]], the deputy leader of the [[Sand\u017eak muftiate]], said that \"some organisations and individuals [are recruiting Balkan Muslims]. There are centers or individuals who probably have connections with certain organisations, and they are motivating people. They also may know ways to transport them to the war zone. Let's be frank. Many here do not even know where Syria is. They cannot know how to go there and get involved in all that is happening there.\" [[Anel Grbovi\u0107]], a journalist from ''[[Novi Pazar]]'', wrote that most fighters from the Sand\u017eak had been removed from the country's two official Islamic communities before traveling to Syria. \"The fact is, there are illegal organisations recruiting people here. The fact is, there are houses where they come together. The fact is, there are facilities where they conduct their religious rituals \u2013 which means they exclude themselves from the mosque. That means they exclude themselves from the system of the Islamic community and are more easily influenced by some individuals or organisations.\" As for Albanian Muslims in Kosovo and Macedonia, they fought for the rebels in order to help \"Sunni brothers\" in their fight. At least one Macedonian fighter said he was recruited via an intermediary in Vienna.

Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]] said: \"The balance of power within the Syrian opposition between responsible forces and terrorists is already murky at best. If even more al Qaeda supporters are moving in, it raises the risks of supplying weapons even to 'friendly' opposition forces even higher.\" Former CIA official and former staff member of the White House National Security Council [[Bruce Riedel]] added: \"Syria is the new epicenter for the global jihad with would be 'martyrs' arriving from across the Islamic world to fight Assad. {{sic}} They are getting experience in the terror arts they will bring home.\" Aaron Zelin of the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]] wrote that \"not everyone who has joined the Syrian rebels is al Qaeda, and only a small number may ever become involved in terrorism after returning to Europe. That said, it would be wrong to conclude that individuals who have trained and fought in Syria pose no potential threat. Numerous studies show that individuals with foreign training and/or fighting experience have featured prominently in European based terrorist plots. [Other studies have shown that foreign-trained fighters] are far more lethal, dangerous and sophisticated than purely domestic cells.\" because the returning fighters are more experienced and battle hardened than those in domestic cells. Having fought and survived the war, domestic cells would most likely look up to and follow the instructions of returning fighters when carrying out violent attacks. It might be more difficult to prevent a terrorist attack from a cell headed by a Foreign fighter that have knowledge in weapons handling, constructing explosives out of improvised goods and operational planning than a cell headed by a leader without this practical training. He suggested a recurrence of roving attackers that followed the Iraq war in the 2000s, the Bosnia war in the 1990s and the [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Afghanistan war]] in the 1980s.\n\nThe ''Free Beacon'' suggested the growing number of foreign fighters was indicated by the release of videos such as one showing the execution of three Christians, including a Roman Catholic priest.

In the [[Early insurgency phase of the Syrian Civil War|early insurgency phase mid-2011 to mid-2012]], their presence was negligible. In the [[2012\u201313 escalation of the Syrian Civil War|mid-2012 to late 2013 escalation phase]], their numbers grew, but they were still far outnumbered by Syrian resistance fighters (only around twelve hundred foreign anti-government jihadists were killed in Syria in 2013).<ref name=\"fb\"/> [[Inter-rebel conflict during the Syrian Civil War|Throughout 2014]], with the rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], the [[Al-Nusra Front]], and other groups, their numbers drastically increased and they partnered with and absorbed Syrian rebel groups, both jihadist and non-jihadist. By 2015, foreign jihadists outnumbered Syrian jihadists and other rebels in casualty rolls (16,212 anti-government foreign jihadists were killed in 2015 compared to 7,798 Syrian anti-government rebels killed that same year), a trend that carried over into 2016 (13,297 foreign jihadists and 8,170 Syrian rebels), and 2017 (7,494 foreign jihadists and 6,452 Syrian rebels). By 2018, the proportion of foreign fighters had far decreased (following heavy losses in the bloody battles of 2015-2017 and various interventions by foreign military forces), and Syrian rebels were once again the majority of anti-government casualties (2,746 foreign jihadists killed compared to 5,852 Syrian rebels).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151231195408/http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=41779 Syria is still bleeding \u2026 more than 55,000 thousand persons were killed during the year of 2015.]</ref><ref>[http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=58114 About 60 thousand were killed in 2016 and we still wait for an international trial for the criminals.]</ref><ref>[http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=81564  2017\u2026the year of the military change and the rise of the regime and its allies to head the list of military powers and influences followed by the SDF\u2026and the loss of the opposition and the organization to large spaces of their controlled areas.]</ref><ref>[http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=111056 2018 under different titles\u2026the death of about 23,000 persons, the displacement of hundreds of thousands others, shifts in the influence of the conflicting powers, and regional and international agreements of de-escalation and withdrawal].</ref> Fighters include those from the Gulf Arab states, Tunisia (following its own [[Tunisian revolution]]), Libya (following the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Civil War]]), China, other Arab states, Russia, including the North Caucasus region, and Western countries.<ref name=\"Cerwyn Moore 2017\">Mark Youngman and Cerwyn Moore (2017) \u2018Russian-Speaking\u2019 Fighters in Syria, Iraq and at Home: Consequences and Context'</ref> Over 600 foreign fighters were killed in the first half of 2013 alone.<ref name=\"fb\"/>  According to the [[Syrian Arab Army]], by September 2014 a total of 54,000 foreign jihadists had come to fight, with the largest groups being [[Chechens]] from [[Russia]] (14,000), Saudi Arabians (12,000), Lebanese (9,000), Iraqis, and Tunisians.<ref name=\"bbc.com\">Mohanad Hashim.

Several hundred come from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia. Many of the recruits were [[Salafi]]sts and, though denied by some Salafist leaders, [[Re\u0161ad Plojovi\u0107]], the deputy leader of the [[Sand\u017eak muftiate]], said that \"some organisations and individuals [are recruiting Balkan Muslims]. There are centers or individuals who probably have connections with certain organisations, and they are motivating people. They also may know ways to transport them to the war zone. Let's be frank. Many here do not even know where Syria is. They cannot know how to go there and get involved in all that is happening there.\" [[Anel Grbovi\u0107]], a journalist from ''[[Novi Pazar]]'', wrote that most fighters from the Sand\u017eak had been removed from the country's two official Islamic communities before traveling to Syria. \"The fact is, there are illegal organisations recruiting people here. The fact is, there are houses where they come together. The fact is, there are facilities where they conduct their religious rituals \u2013 which means they exclude themselves from the mosque. That means they exclude themselves from the system of the Islamic community and are more easily influenced by some individuals or organisations.\" As for Albanian Muslims in Kosovo and Macedonia, they fought for the rebels in order to help \"Sunni brothers\" in their fight. At least one Macedonian fighter said he was recruited via an intermediary in Vienna.

Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]] said: \"The balance of power within the Syrian opposition between responsible forces and terrorists is already murky at best. If even more al Qaeda supporters are moving in, it raises the risks of supplying weapons even to 'friendly' opposition forces even higher.\" Former CIA official and former staff member of the White House National Security Council [[Bruce Riedel]] added: \"Syria is the new epicenter for the global jihad with would be 'martyrs' arriving from across the Islamic world to fight Assad. {{sic}} They are getting experience in the terror arts they will bring home.\" Aaron Zelin of the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]] wrote that \"not everyone who has joined the Syrian rebels is al Qaeda, and only a small number may ever become involved in terrorism after returning to Europe. That said, it would be wrong to conclude that individuals who have trained and fought in Syria pose no potential threat. Numerous studies show that individuals with foreign training and/or fighting experience have featured prominently in European based terrorist plots. [Other studies have shown that foreign-trained fighters] are far more lethal, dangerous and sophisticated than purely domestic cells.\" because the returning fighters are more experienced and battle hardened than those in domestic cells. Having fought and survived the war, domestic cells would most likely look up to and follow the instructions of returning fighters when carrying out violent attacks. It might be more difficult to prevent a terrorist attack from a cell headed by a Foreign fighter that have knowledge in weapons handling, constructing explosives out of improvised goods and operational planning than a cell headed by a leader without this practical training. He suggested a recurrence of roving attackers that followed the Iraq war in the 2000s, the Bosnia war in the 1990s and the [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Afghanistan war]] in the 1980s.\n\nThe ''Free Beacon'' suggested the growing number of foreign fighters was indicated by the release of videos such as one showing the execution of three Christians, including a Roman Catholic priest.
