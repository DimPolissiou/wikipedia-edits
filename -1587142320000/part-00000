Best known for being a tall [[left-arm orthodox spin]] bowler, he helped guide his division to the National Cricket Title in his maiden season.

Despite not playing often for the team, Razzak believed that the experience he gained from the tournament was important. He stated that [[Anil Kumble]] \"was very helpful when I asked him about bowling in Test matches.

June 1982) is a Bangladeshi [[cricket]]er, who currently plays [[Test cricket]] and retired from [[Limited overs cricket|limited overs format]] of the game. Razzak is the first Bangladeshi to take 200 wickets in [[One Day International|ODIs]]. He is also the first left arm spinner and 2nd spinner after [[Saqlain Mushtaq]] took a [[Hat-trick]].\n\nHe made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut at Bangladeshi domestic level for Khulna Division in the 2001/02 season. Best known for being a tall [[left-arm orthodox spin]] bowler, he helped guide his division to the National Cricket Title in his maiden season. From there he was selected for Bangladesh A (training team for the full national squad) performing well against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe A]], including figures of 7 for 17 in one game in [[Dhaka]].\n\nThough he has played just nine Tests, he has been more successful in [[One Day International]]s (ODIs) and was Bangladesh's leading wicket-taker in the format in 2013, when he reached the 200 wickets milestone. <ref>{{citation|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?class=2;id=25;type=team |title=Records / Bangladesh / One-Day Internationals / Most wickets |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=2011-10-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330230720/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?class=2%3Bid%3D25%3Btype%3Dteam |archivedate=30 March 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2018, he became the first Bangladesh player to take 500 wickets in first-class cricket.<ref name=first>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22131211/abdur-razzak-tushar-imran-climb-first-class-summits |title=Abdur Razzak and Tushar Imran climb first-class summits |author=Isam, Mohammad |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=18 January 2018|date=17 January 2018 }}</ref> After four years, he made comeback to the Test squad on 8 February 2018 [[Sri Lankan cricket team in Bangladesh in 2017\u201318|against Sri Lanka]], taking 4-63 opening the bowling, but Bangladesh lost by 215 runs.<ref name=razzaqcomeback>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18527/report/1130745/bangladesh-vs-sri-lanka-2nd-test-sri-lanka-tour-of-bangladesh-2018 |title=Sri Lanka bat; Abdur Razzak returns after four years |author=Fernando, Andrew Fidel |publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 February 2018}}</ref> In November 2019, he took his 600th first-class wicket, becoming the first Bangladeshi bowler to reach the milestone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/27987347/abdur-razzak-becomes-first-bangladeshi-bowler-bag-600-first-class-wickets |title=Abdur Razzak becomes first Bangladeshi bowler to bag 600 first-class wickets |author=Isam, Mohammad |work=ESPN Cricinfo |date=2 November 2019 |accessdate=2 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Domestic career==\n===Indian Premier League===\nRazzak was the only Bangladeshi to play in the [[2008 Indian Premier League]] making him the first Bangladeshi to play the league. He was bought for $50,000 by the [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] and played in only one match. Despite not playing often for the team, Razzak believed that the experience he gained from the tournament was important. He stated that [[Anil Kumble]] \"was very helpful when I asked him about bowling in Test matches. He told me that given my bowling approach, it is very important to use variations within my line and length. Actually, captains would want a breakthrough from me so without using variations, wickets are hard to come by.

He established himself as a regular fixture in the squad although he was not a regular in the starting eleven. He made his [[Test cricket|Test]] debut in the second Test of the [[Australian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2005-06|Australian tour of Bangladesh]] in April 2006.\n\nAfter impressing in one-day cricket, he was called up for his Test debut at home to [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] at the [[Chittagong Divisional Stadium]]. [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]] batted first and he recorded 15 in his first Test match [[innings]]. A decent start but he failed to take a wicket in Australia's only innings and he registered a [[duck (cricket)|golden duck]] in an innings defeat.

His older brother, David (died 2015), became a meteorologist. <ref> https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wea.2566 </ref> The third and youngest brother, Paul Houghton, became a lecturer in engineering and was treasurer and company chairman of the John Ray Initiative, connecting the environment, science and Christianity.\n\nThe family moved to [[Rhyl]] when John was two, and he attended [[Rhyl High School|Rhyl Grammar School]] where he discovered his interest in science. He continued his education at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], gaining an MA (Oxon), MPhil and DPhil.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}<ref>http://www.japanprize.jp/en/prize_prof_2006_houghton.html</ref> He was brought up as an evangelical Christian by devout Christian parents and believed in science and Christianity as strengthening each other, as well as [[Christianity and environmentalism]]. Houghton's evangelical Christianity combined with his scientific background made him a significant voice in evangelical Christian circles.

Upon election, a Land Reform Policy Group (LRPG) was established under the chairmanship of [[Lord Sewel]], then [[Scottish Office]] Minister of State, who was also tasked with steering devolution legislation though the house of lords. Policy proposals and an extensive public consultation were published by the LRPG in 1999, the same year that the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first elections]] to the newly devolved Scottish parliament returned a Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition. Following the momentum of the 1997 and 1999 elections, devolution and the LRPG's proposals, land reform progressed rapidly in the [[1st Scottish Parliament|first session of the Scottish parliament]] with bills introduced to abolish Scotland's feudal land tenure system and a draft land reform bill introduced in 2000.

The Land Reform (Scotland) Act has three parts, with provisions regarding three areas of land rights in Scotland; the creation of a legal framework for [[Freedom to roam|land access]], the community right to buy and crofting community right to buy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2003/2/pdfs/asp_20030002_en.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref> The first part formalises the tradition in Scotland of unhindered access to open countryside. It creates a framework for responsible access to land and inland water,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2003/2/notes/division/2 |title=Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 \u2013 Explanatory Notes |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-10-31}}</ref> provided that care was taken not to cause damage or interfere with activities including farming and game stalking. Access rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming. This aspect of the Act follows the distinctive approach set out in the [[Scottish Outdoor Access Code]], specifying the rights and responsibilities of land managers, countryside users and recreational managers.<ref>{{cite web |ssrn=1673225 |title=Progressive Property in Action: The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 by John A.

It differs from the community right to buy in that it can be exercised at any time, regardless of whether the land has been put on the market, allowing crofting communities to purchase land even in the absence of a willing seller.\n\nThe Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 amends the law relating to agricultural holdings under the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991. It provides for new forms of agricultural tenancies and makes provision in relation to these tenancies, the right of certain agricultural tenants to buy land and the use of certain agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes. It makes special provision for certain agricultural tenancies where the tenant is a partnership and for the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants arising under agricultural tenancies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2003/11/pdfs/asp_20030011_en.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==SNP Government (2007\u2013present)==\n{{See also|Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015|Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016}}\nThe May [[2007 Scottish Parliament election]] resulted, for the first time, in a [[Scottish National Party]] [[minority government]]. The first term of SNP government was marked by a lack of action on land reform. However, following re-election in [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011]], this time with a parliamentary majority, land reform returned to the government agenda with the Scottish Government establishing the '''Land Reform Review Group''' in 2012 and First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] in 2013 announcing a target of seeing 1 million acres of land in community ownership by 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=1 million acres short life working group |url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Environment/land-reform/MillionAcres |website=The Scottish Government |accessdate=26 March 2017}}[[File:UKOpenGovernmentLicence.svg|30px]] This content is available under the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/ Open Government Licence v3.0]. \u00a9 Crown copyright.</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Elliot |first1=Alison |last2=Watt |first2=John |last3=Ian |first3=Cooke |last4=Taylor |first4=Pip |title=The Land of Scotland and the Common Good: Report of the Land Reform Review Group |url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0045/00451087.pdf |publisher=The Scottish Government |accessdate=4 March 2017 |language=English |date=2014}}</ref> The Land Reform Review Group was given the task of identifying how land reform would enable rural and urban communities to have a stake in the ownership, governance, management and use of land, assist in the acquisition and management of that land and promote new relationships between land, people, economy and environment in Scotland. Its final report, published in May 2014, recommended policies to modernise and diversify land ownership in Scotland and encourage sustainable development, some of which would form the basis of the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]] and [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016]]. During this period the Land Registration etc. (Scotland) Act 2012 introduced changes to the [[conveyancing]] system in Scotland, with the aim of having all land in Scotland registered under the [[Registers of Scotland|Land Register of Scotland]] within 10 years. Prior to the act, entry of land into the register would be prompted by a sale but other transfers of land would not prompt first entry. The act expanded the triggers for first entry to include any transfer of property or the signing of a long lease in order to accelerate the transition from the antiquated deed based Register of Sassines to the modernised map based Land Register.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gamba |first1=Stephen |title=The Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 \u2013 a brief guide |url=http://www.gillespiemacandrew.co.uk/media/321190/gillespie-macandrew-land-reform-scotland-bill-2015-a-brief-guide.pdf |publisher=Gillespie MacAndrew LLP |accessdate=26 March 2017 |date=17 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Salvesen v Riddell case (2012\u20132013)===\nIn 2012, a section of the Agricultural Holdings Act was challenged and suspended by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]].<ref name=svr13>{{cite web |title=Salvesen v Riddell and another, Lord Advocate intervening (Scotland) |url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2012-0111.html |author=Lord Hope, Lord Kerr, Lord Wilson, Lord Reed, Lord Toulson |publisher=Uk Supreme Court |accessdate=31 October 2016 |date=24 April 2013}}</ref> The trigger for this ruling was an appeal by Salvesen, the owner of Peaston Farm near [[Ormiston]]. The Riddells were tenants in this farm and Section 72 of the 2003 Act greatly restricted the ability of landowners to terminate the tenancies of their tenants. Initially, the start date of this restriction was set to 4 February 2003. This led many landlords, including Salvesen, to terminate the tenancies of their tenants the day before \u2013 3 February 2003. A later amendment to section 72 retroactively set the start date of the restrictions to 16 September 2002, which made Salvesen's termination notice ineffective.\n\nSalvesen applied to the [[Scottish Land Court|Land Court]], which repealed his application. He then appealed to the Court of Session and obtained permission to apply to the UK Supreme Court. His main claim was that Section 72 is incompatible with his property rights, the rights guaranteed to him by [[Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]. The  Supreme  Court  unanimously  allowed  the  appeal.  It  found  that  Mr.  Salvesen's  A1P1  rights  were  violated  by section  72(10)  of  the  2003  Act  and  that  the  provision  was  outside  the  legislative  competence  of  the  Scottish  Parliament under the [[Scotland Act 1998]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The legal status of unlawful legislation: Salvesen v Riddell [2013] UKSC 22 |url=https://publiclawforeveryone.com/2013/04/25/the-legal-status-of-unlawful-legislation-salvesen-v-riddell-2013-uksc-22/ |date=2013-04-25 |author=Mark Eliott}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The case that keeps surprising \u2013 Salvesen v Riddell |url=http://www.brodies.com/blog/case-keeps-surprising-salvesen-v-riddell/ |accessdate=31 October 2016 |author=Gemma Mckinlay |date=2015-01-29}}</ref>\n\n===Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015===\nThe [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]], marked the first major piece of land reform legislation to be passed under the SNP government.

It also introduced a new community right to buy land which is abandoned, neglected or causing harm to the environmental wellbeing of the community. Similar to the 2003 Act's crofting community right to buy, this new right does not require a willing seller. Rather, Scottish ministers may compel a landowner to sell to communities with a registered interest, if they deem the sale likely to contribute to sustainable local development.\n\nFurther provisions granted community bodies the right to request to purchase, lease, manage or use land and buildings held by local authorities, Scottish ministers and other Scottish public bodies, of which relevant authorities are required to create and maintain a publicly available register. The Act reformed [[Common Good Fund|Common Good Property]], requiring local authorities to establish and maintain registers of all common good property held by them and to inform and consult local community bodies before any change of use or disposal of common good property. Allotments, updates and simplifies legislation on allotments.\n\nIt also set a requirement for local authorities to take steps to provide [[Allotment (gardening)|allotments]] should waiting lists exceed certain lengths and strengthened protections for allotments, regulated rents and allowed tenants to sell food produced on allotments on a not for profit basis. The act required that local authorities develop food growing strategies, including the identification of land that may be used as allotment sites or potential land for community cultivation.\n\nIt has been found that the Scottish approach to [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015|community empowerment and localism]] marks an example of policy divergence from the rest of the UK<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rolfe |first1=Steve |title=Divergence in Community Participation Policy: Analysing Localism and Community Empowerment Using a Theory of Change Approach |journal=Local Government Studies |volume=42 |pages=97\u2013118 |doi=10.1080/03003930.2015.1081848 |year=2016 |hdl=1893/23241 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> but that significant challenges remain in how to ensure a shared strategy; shared resources; and shared accountability.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=Ian |last2=Fejszes |first2=Violetta |last3=T\u00e0rrega |first3=Mariola |title=The Community Empowerment Act and localism under devolution in Scotland: The perspective of multiple stakeholders in a council ward |journal=International Journal of Public Sector Management |doi=10.1108/IJPSM-03-2018-0080 |year=2018 |url=http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/36095/1/Elliott%20et%20al%20-%20The%20Community%20Empowerment%20Act%20and%20Localism%20under%20Devolution%20in%20Scotland%20AAM.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016===\nIn 2013 [[Richard Lochhead]], then [[Cabinet Secretary for the Rural Economy and Connectivity|Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment]], announced the launch of the Agricultural Holdings Review, which would examine the situation of land ownership and use, tenant-owner relationships, and all of the relevant legislation.

This permitted [[Scottish Ministers]] to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Like the Crofting Community Right to Buy and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land, the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area.<ref>{{cite web |title=Community rights to buy in Scotland \u2013 which is which, and what are they for? |url=http://www.brodies.com/node/8185 |website=Brodies |accessdate=5 March 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a third party to purchase land on the same basis.\n\nThis new Community Right to Buy was not the only provision of the Act.

The landowners stated that private ownership brought efficiency and greater protection for [[endangered species]] from development of land. Also, there were other social, economic, and environmental benefits to private ownership of Scottish land. The Duke of Roxburghe raised concerns specifically about the economic impacts, and the impact on the agricultural sector, saying:\n{{Quote|Radical proposals that threaten private property rights and which impact adversely on private enterprise, investment and development or which deprive young aspiring farmers the opportunity to get a firm foothold on the farming ladder would be immensely damaging in our view and act against the interests of the communities involved.|Duke of Roxburghe|August 2013, quoted in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper|<ref name=\"scotsman-2013-august\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/lairds-warn-holyrood-over-new-land-buy-out-powers-1-3023862 |title=Lairds warn Holyrood over new land buy-out powers |website=www.scotsman.com |language=en |date=1 August 2013 |access-date=27 April 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nMany other landlords opposed the passage of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016. Mark Coombs, the estate manager of the {{convert|33,000|ha|acre|abbr=on}} Queensberry Estate, owned by the [[Duke of Buccleuch|10th Duke of Buccleuch]], stated that \"there are also concerns if the purpose of changing the ownership is simply to allow another party \u2026 to carry out the same activity as is currently being undertaken by the existing owner as this strikes at the essence of ownership rights and suggests a clear move towards a more collectivist political view which is not representative of the body politic of Scotland.\" Thus hurting the property rights of the landowners since it strips them of control of their property.<ref name=independent13 />\n\nDavid Johnstone, chairman of Scottish Land and Estates, said the proposal could lead to land not being made available to let, and hurting the tenant farming sector. Johnstone said: \"What you are doing is giving a tenant a stake in the capital value of the farm. If the landlord doesn\u2019t have the ability to pay, then the farm never comes back...

There are double criteria: significant benefit from the transfer, and significant harm from non-transfer. Each one of these criteria alone should be sufficient.\n* The upper bound of 10 years on tenancy (part 10, s.74) is too short and hurts the rights of the tenants.\n* The paragraphs on transparency and accountability (parts 3-4, s.35-36) are too weak: there are no sanctions on refusing to give information about the landowner, and there is no obligation to give information on the real person owning the land (the real landowner often hides behind a \"shell company\").\n\nLand-reform activists claim that the current reform is insufficient as several important amendments were voted down by SNP and Conservative backbenchers, including:<ref name=guardian16 />\n* Land cap \u2013 restricting the amount of land that one individual can own.\n* Preventing land ownership via offshore tax havens. Andy Wightman, the land reform spokesperson for the Scottish Greens and MSP candidate for Lothian, revealed that companies owned by the Buccleuch Estates used tax havens in the Cayman Islands. He said that \"The Green bid to clamp down on the use of tax havens goes to the heart of understanding who owns Scotland.

Upon election, a Land Reform Policy Group (LRPG) was established under the chairmanship of [[Lord Sewel]], then [[Scottish Office]] Minister of State, who was also tasked with steering devolution legislation though the house of lords. Policy proposals and an extensive public consultation were published by the LRPG in 1999, the same year that the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first elections]] to the newly devolved Scottish parliament returned a Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition. Following the momentum of the 1997 and 1999 elections, devolution and the LRPG's proposals, land reform progressed rapidly in the [[1st Scottish Parliament|first session of the Scottish parliament]] with bills introduced to abolish Scotland's feudal land tenure system and a draft land reform bill introduced in 2000.

The Land Reform (Scotland) Act has three parts, with provisions regarding three areas of land rights in Scotland; the creation of a legal framework for [[Freedom to roam|land access]], the community right to buy and crofting community right to buy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2003/2/pdfs/asp_20030002_en.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref> The first part formalises the tradition in Scotland of unhindered access to open countryside.

Access rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming.

It differs from the community right to buy in that it can be exercised at any time, regardless of whether the land has been put on the market, allowing crofting communities to purchase land even in the absence of a willing seller.\n\nThe Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 amends the law relating to agricultural holdings under the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991. It provides for new forms of agricultural tenancies and makes provision in relation to these tenancies, the right of certain agricultural tenants to buy land and the use of certain agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes. It makes special provision for certain agricultural tenancies where the tenant is a partnership and for the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants arising under agricultural tenancies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2003/11/pdfs/asp_20030011_en.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==SNP Government (2007\u2013present)==\n{{See also|Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015|Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016}}\nThe May [[2007 Scottish Parliament election]] resulted, for the first time, in a [[Scottish National Party]] [[minority government]].

Its final report, published in May 2014, recommended policies to modernise and diversify land ownership in Scotland and encourage sustainable development, some of which would form the basis of the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]] and [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016]]. During this period the Land Registration etc. (Scotland) Act 2012 introduced changes to the [[conveyancing]] system in Scotland, with the aim of having all land in Scotland registered under the [[Registers of Scotland|Land Register of Scotland]] within 10 years. Prior to the act, entry of land into the register would be prompted by a sale but other transfers of land would not prompt first entry. The act expanded the triggers for first entry to include any transfer of property or the signing of a long lease in order to accelerate the transition from the antiquated deed based Register of Sassines to the modernised map based Land Register.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gamba |first1=Stephen |title=The Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 \u2013 a brief guide |url=http://www.gillespiemacandrew.co.uk/media/321190/gillespie-macandrew-land-reform-scotland-bill-2015-a-brief-guide.pdf |publisher=Gillespie MacAndrew LLP |accessdate=26 March 2017 |date=17 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Salvesen v Riddell case (2012\u20132013)===\nIn 2012, a section of the Agricultural Holdings Act was challenged and suspended by the [[Supreme Court of the UK]].<ref name=svr13>{{cite web |title=Salvesen v Riddell and another, Lord Advocate intervening (Scotland) |url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2012-0111.html |author=Lord Hope, Lord Kerr, Lord Wilson, Lord Reed, Lord Toulson |publisher=Uk Supreme Court |accessdate=31 October 2016 |date=24 April 2013}}</ref> The trigger for this ruling was an appeal by Salvesen, the owner of Peaston Farm near [[Ormiston]]. The Riddells were tenants in this farm and Section 72 of the 2003 Act greatly restricted the ability of landowners to terminate the tenancies of their tenants. Initially, the start date of this restriction was set to 4 February 2003. This led many landlords, including Salvesen, to terminate the tenancies of their tenants the day before \u2013 3 February 2003. A later amendment to section 72 retroactively set the start date of the restrictions to 16 September 2002, which made Salvesen's termination notice ineffective.\n\nSalvesen applied to the [[Scottish Land Court|Land Court]], which repealed his application. He then appealed to the Court of Session and obtained permission to apply to the UK Supreme Court. His main claim was that Section 72 is incompatible with his property rights, the rights guaranteed to him by [[Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights]].

Its provisions covered different areas pertaining to community empowerment and public participation in policy and planning, including several related directly to land.<ref>{{cite web |title=Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act FAQs |url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/engage/CommunityEmpowermentBillFAQs |website=Scottish Government |accessdate=23 March 2017}} [[File:UKOpenGovernmentLicence.svg|30px]] This content is available under the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/ Open Government Licence v3.0]. \u00a9 Crown copyright.</ref> The most important of these was the extension of the Community Right to Buy to communities of any size, including, for the first time, those in urban areas. It also introduced a new community right to buy land which is abandoned, neglected or causing harm to the environmental wellbeing of the community. Similar to the 2003 Act's crofting community right to buy, this new right does not require a willing seller. Rather, Scottish ministers may compel a landowner to sell to communities with a registered interest, if they deem the sale likely to contribute to sustainable local development.\n\nFurther provisions granted community bodies the right to request to purchase, lease, manage or use land and buildings held by local authorities, Scottish ministers and other Scottish public bodies, of which relevant authorities are required to create and maintain a publicly available register. The Act reformed [[Common Good Fund|Common Good Property]], requiring local authorities to establish and maintain registers of all common good property held by them and to inform and consult local community bodies before any change of use or disposal of common good property. Allotments, updates and simplifies legislation on allotments.\n\nIt also set a requirement for local authorities to take steps to provide [[Allotment (gardening)|allotments]] should waiting lists exceed certain lengths and strengthened protections for allotments, regulated rents and allowed tenants to sell food produced on allotments on a not for profit basis. The act required that local authorities develop food growing strategies, including the identification of land that may be used as allotment sites or potential land for community cultivation.\n\nIt has been found that the Scottish approach to [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015|community empowerment and localism]] marks an example of policy divergence from the rest of the UK<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rolfe |first1=Steve |title=Divergence in Community Participation Policy: Analysing Localism and Community Empowerment Using a Theory of Change Approach |journal=Local Government Studies |volume=42 |pages=97\u2013118 |doi=10.1080/03003930.2015.1081848 |year=2016 |hdl=1893/23241 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> but that significant challenges remain in how to ensure a shared strategy; shared resources; and shared accountability.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=Ian |last2=Fejszes |first2=Violetta |last3=T\u00e0rrega |first3=Mariola |title=The Community Empowerment Act and localism under devolution in Scotland: The perspective of multiple stakeholders in a council ward |journal=International Journal of Public Sector Management |doi=10.1108/IJPSM-03-2018-0080 |year=2018 |url=http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/36095/1/Elliott%20et%20al%20-%20The%20Community%20Empowerment%20Act%20and%20Localism%20under%20Devolution%20in%20Scotland%20AAM.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016===\nIn 2013 [[Richard Lochhead]], then [[Cabinet Secretary for the Rural Economy and Connectivity|Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment]], announced the launch of the Agricultural Holdings Review, which would examine the situation of land ownership and use, tenant-owner relationships, and all of the relevant legislation.

This permitted [[Scottish Ministers]] to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Like the Crofting Community Right to Buy and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land, the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area.<ref>{{cite web |title=Community rights to buy in Scotland \u2013 which is which, and what are they for? |url=http://www.brodies.com/node/8185 |website=Brodies |accessdate=5 March 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a third party to purchase land on the same basis.\n\nThis new Community Right to Buy was not the only provision of the Act. The Act required that the Scottish Government produce a 'Land Rights and Responsibilities Statement', setting out its objectives for land reform and to establish a [[Scottish Land Commission]] to take forward the land reform process and prepare a strategic plan, for the approval of [[Scottish Ministers]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blair |first1=Mike |title=A Brief Guide to Land Reform in Scotland |url=http://www.gillespiemacandrew.co.uk/media/340813/land-reform-act-2016.pdf |publisher=Gillespie Macandrew LLP |accessdate=5 March 2017 |date=April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306131212/http://www.gillespiemacandrew.co.uk/media/340813/land-reform-act-2016.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other provisions of the act included new regulations to require persons who control land to be identified, with information obtained to appear in the Land Register of Scotland; the removal of sporting rights exemption from rates, are to be re-valued; and further powers for [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] to control deer management.

Additionally, tenants under the 1991 Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act are now presumed to have registered their right to buy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Scottish farmer facing eviction wins last-minute reprieve |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/26/scottish-farmer-facing-eviction-wins-last-minute-reprieve |accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=guardian16>{{cite web |title=A new dawn for land reform in Scotland? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/scotland-blog/2016/mar/17/a-new-dawn-for-land-reform-in-scotland |website=The Guardian |accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Holyrood approves sweeping Scottish land reforms |url=https://www.ft.com/content/3b4234da-eb55-11e5-bb79-2303682345c8 |accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n=== Criticism by landlords ===\nIn August 2013, landowners including the [[Duke of Roxburghe]] expressed concerns about the work of the Land Reform Review Group and the focus on community ownership. The landowners stated that private ownership brought efficiency and greater protection for [[endangered species]] from development of land. Also, there were other social, economic, and environmental benefits to private ownership of Scottish land. The Duke of Roxburghe raised concerns specifically about the economic impacts, and the impact on the agricultural sector, saying:\n{{Quote|Radical proposals that threaten private property rights and which impact adversely on private enterprise, investment and development or which deprive young aspiring farmers the opportunity to get a firm foothold on the farming ladder would be immensely damaging in our view and act against the interests of the communities involved.|Duke of Roxburghe|August 2013, quoted in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper|<ref name=\"scotsman-2013-august\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/lairds-warn-holyrood-over-new-land-buy-out-powers-1-3023862 |title=Lairds warn Holyrood over new land buy-out powers |website=www.scotsman.com |language=en |date=1 August 2013 |access-date=27 April 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nMany other landlords opposed the passage of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016. Mark Coombs, the estate manager of the {{convert|33,000|ha|acre|abbr=on}} Queensberry Estate, owned by the [[Duke of Buccleuch|10th Duke of Buccleuch]], stated that \"there are also concerns if the purpose of changing the ownership is simply to allow another party \u2026 to carry out the same activity as is currently being undertaken by the existing owner as this strikes at the essence of ownership rights and suggests a clear move towards a more collectivist political view which is not representative of the body politic of Scotland.\" Thus hurting the property rights of the landowners since it strips them of control of their property.<ref name=independent13 />\n\nDavid Johnstone, chairman of Scottish Land and Estates, said the proposal could lead to land not being made available to let, and hurting the tenant farming sector. Johnstone said: \"What you are doing is giving a tenant a stake in the capital value of the farm. If the landlord doesn\u2019t have the ability to pay, then the farm never comes back... That has got to have a knock on effect in the confidence of anyone who might wish to come to let land or is letting land at the moment.\"<ref name=telegraph15>{{cite news |last1=Auslan Cramb |title=Property rights threatened by 'aggressive' change in land reform bill |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/countryside/12057440/Property-rights-threatened-by-aggressive-change-in-land-reform-bill.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |accessdate=31 October 2016 |date=2015-12-18}}</ref>\n\nSeafield and Strathspey Estates argued that land concentration is not a bad thing, as it may lead to more efficient management. Seafield and Strathspey Estates is a {{convert|35,000|ha|acre|abbr=on}} enterprise which includes salmon beats on the [[River Spey]], and is managed on behalf of the family of the [[Earl of Seafield]]. It said landowners were being blamed for the inefficiencies of local and central government. \"There is a myth presented by individuals sponsoring land reform in Scotland that 'too many acres are owned by too few individuals.' It may be true that 'many acres are owned by few individuals' but there is very little evidence presented to show that this is a bad thing\".<ref name=independent13 />\n\n=== Criticism by Scottish Parliament ===\nThe Land Reform (Scotland) Bill was criticised during its passage by the [[Committees of the Scottish Parliament|Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee]] of the Scottish Parliament on the basis that it granted a significant power to [[Scottish Ministers|Scottish Minister]] to implement much of the details of the Act through [[Scottish Statutory Instrument|secondary legislation]] and delegated powers. Turcan Connell identified concerns around the implementation of the Act and the amount of scrutiny the detailed law would receive.<ref name=\"turcan-connell\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.turcanconnell.com/media/constitutional-issues/scottish-land-reform/articles/2016/04/land-reform-update-april-2016/ |title=Land Reform Update \u2013 April 2016 |date=27 April 2016 |website=Turcan Connell |publisher=Turcan Connell |language=en |access-date=25 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426055558/https://www.turcanconnell.com/media/constitutional-issues/scottish-land-reform/articles/2016/04/land-reform-update-april-2016/ |archive-date=26 April 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Recommendations by legal experts ===\nSeveral parts of the Bill have been criticized as follows:<ref name=ms15>{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2698578 |title=The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill and Human Rights: Key Points and Recommendations |year=2015 |last1=MacInnes |first1=Megan |last2=Shields |first2=Kirsteen}}</ref>\n* The criteria for community buyout (s.47) is too demanding. There are double criteria: significant benefit from the transfer, and significant harm from non-transfer. Each one of these criteria alone should be sufficient.\n* The upper bound of 10 years on tenancy (part 10, s.74) is too short and hurts the rights of the tenants.\n* The paragraphs on transparency and accountability (parts 3-4, s.35-36) are too weak: there are no sanctions on refusing to give information about the landowner, and there is no obligation to give information on the real person owning the land (the real landowner often hides behind a \"shell company\").\n\nLand-reform activists claim that the current reform is insufficient as several important amendments were voted down by SNP and Conservative backbenchers, including:<ref name=guardian16 />\n* Land cap \u2013 restricting the amount of land that one individual can own.\n* Preventing land ownership via offshore tax havens. Andy Wightman, the land reform spokesperson for the Scottish Greens and MSP candidate for Lothian, revealed that companies owned by the Buccleuch Estates used tax havens in the Cayman Islands. He said that \"The Green bid to clamp down on the use of tax havens goes to the heart of understanding who owns Scotland. As we have seen this week with the uncovering of the complex corporate affairs of the Buccleuch Estates, there is an urgent need to ensure transparency in who profits from Scottish land.\"\n\n=== Criticism by PhD students ===\nIn a 2016 article in the journal of the [[Law Society of Scotland]], Douglas Maxwell claims the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill contains poorly-defined terms such as \"sustainable development\" and \"communities\" which may place the bill in conflict with international human rights laws, particularly the [[ECHR]] [[Protocol 1, article 1]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Douglas Maxwell |title=Human rights and land reform: unanswered questions |url=http://www.journalonline.co.uk/Magazine/61-1/1021198.aspx |date=2016-01-18}}</ref>\n\n== Community focus ==\nLand reform in Scotland is unusual in its emphasis on [[community ownership|community land ownership]], with the Scottish government adopting the target of seeing 1 million acres of land under community ownership by 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=One Million Acres by 2020 \u2013 Strategy report and recommendations from the 1 Million Acre Short Life Working Group |url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2015/12/5735 |publisher=The Scottish Government |accessdate=6 March 2017 |date=2015}}</ref><ref name=bg07>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2005.09.004 |title=Community-based land reform: Lessons from Scotland |journal=Land Use Policy |volume=24 |pages=24\u201334 |year=2007 |last1=Bryden |first1=John |last2=Geisler |first2=Charles}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.07.013 |title=Why community ownership?

''English Reformations'' Clarendon Press (1993) p. 173</ref>\n\nIt was the logical successor of the [[English Reformation#Royal Injunctions of 1547,2-17-19|Edwardian Injunctions of 1547]] and the [[Sacrament Act 1547|Sacrament Act]] of the same year which had taken piecemeal steps towards the official introduction of Protestant doctrine and practice into England and Wales.<ref>''Documents of the English Reformation'', Gerald Bray (ed)Cambridge, James Clark & C\u00ba(1994), pp 247ff</ref> It established the [[Book of Common Prayer (1549)|''Book of Common Prayer'']] as the sole legal form of worship in England. Before 1549, the churches of England used various different versions of the [[Latin]]-[[language]] [[Missal]].<ref>'''Concerning the Service of the Church''' (par. 5) in the Book of Common Prayer 1662</ref>\n\n==Nature of the Book of Common Prayer==\nThe Book of Common Prayer was far from just an English-language translation of the Latin [[liturgical book]]s; it was largely a new creation, mainly the work of Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]], which in its text and its ceremonial directions reflected various reforming doctrinal influences (notably the breviary of Cardinal Qui\u00f1onez and the ''Consultation'' of Hermann von Wied).<ref>Bp E.C.S Gibson in the introduction of ''The First and Second Prayer Books of Edward VI'', London J.M. Dent & Sons (1964), pp vi.ff</ref> The first Act (2 & 3 Edw 6 c 1) was called ''An Act for Uniformity of Service and Administration of the Sacraments throughout the Realm''. It deemed as follows:\n<blockquote>\n''and that all and singular ministers in any cathedral or parish church or other place within this realm of England, Wales, Calais, and the marches of the same, or other the king's dominions, shall, from and after the feast of Pentecost next coming, be bound to say and use the Matins, Evensong, celebration of the Lord's Supper, commonly called the Mass, and administration of each of the sacraments, and all their common and open prayer, in such order and form as is mentioned in the said book, and none other or otherwise''<ref name=\"Gee 1896\">Gee, Henry and Hardy, William J. ''Documents Illustrative of English Church History'', p. 360 London: Macmillan and Co, 1896.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThis section covers the following three points. England claimed many territories as its own with the phrase \u201cor other of the king\u2019s dominions\u201d.  And that there was plenty of time for England\u2019s territories to become accustomed to these new laws giving them approximately one year to use The Book of Common Prayer to unify the country behind a single common practice of Faith.\nThen follow penalties against those of the clergy that should substitute any other form of service, or shall not use The Book of Common Prayer, or who shall preach or speak against it: \n<blockquote>\n''lest any obstinate person who willingly would disturb so godly order and quiet in his realm should not go unpunished, that it may also be ordained and enacted by the authority aforesaid, that if any manner of parson, vicar, or other whatsoever minister, that ought or should sing or say common prayer mentioned in the said book, or minister the sacraments, shall after the said feast of Pentecost next coming refuse to use the said common prayers, or to minister the sacraments in such cathedral or parish church or other places as he should use or minister the same, in such order and form as they be mentioned and set forth in the said book or shall use, wilfully and obstinately standing in the same, any other rite, ceremony, order, form, or manner of Mass openly or privily, or Matins, Evensong, administration of the sacraments, or other open prayer that is mentioned and set forth in the said book; or shall preach, declare, or speak anything in the derogation or depraving of the said book, or anything therein contained, or of any part thereof; and shall be thereof lawfully convicted according to the laws of this realm, by verdict of twelve men, or by his own confession, or by the notorious evidence of the fact, shall lose and forfeit to the king's highness, his heirs and successors, for his first offence, the profit of such one of his spiritual benefices or promotions as it shall please the king's highness to assign or appoint, coming and arising in one whole year next after his conviction: and also that the same person so convicted shall for the same offence suffer imprisonment by the space of six months, without bail or mainprize.''<ref name=\"Gee 1896\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis provided loss of all income, which was forfeited to the Crown. Imprisonment \u201cwithout bail or mainprize\u201d meant one could not pay one's way out of prison, nor be given freedom until acquittal or the completion of the sentence.\n\nA second offence was dealt with more harshly: \n<blockquote>\n''and if any such person once convicted of any offence concerning the premises, shall after his first conviction again offend and be thereof in form aforesaid lawfully convicted, that then the same person shall for his second offence suffer imprisonment by the space of one whole year, and also shall therefore be deprived ipso facto of all his promotions; and that it shall be lawful to all patrons, donors, and grantees of all and singular the same spiritual promotions, to present to the same any other able clerk, in like manner and form as though the party so offending were dead;''<ref name=\"Gee P.361\">Gee, Henry and Hardy, William J. ''Documents Illustrative of English Church History'', p. 361  London: Macmillan and Co, 1896.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nA second offence added a year to the previous six months in prison, loss of livelihood, and any promotions and position would be given to another as if the miscreant had died.  A third offence was the harshest, punished by life in prison:\n<blockquote>\n''and that if any such person or persons, after he shall be twice convicted in form aforesaid, shall offend against any of the premises the third time, and shall be thereof in form aforesaid lawfully convicted, that then the person so offending and convicted the third time shall suffer imprisonment during his life.''<ref>Gee, Henry and Hardy, William J. ''Documents Illustrative of English Church History'', p. 363  London: Macmillan and Co, 1896.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nNothing in this Act enforced attendance at public worship, but the provisions of the Act apply to every kind of public worship or \u201copen prayer\u201d, as it was called, which might take place. The Act itself defines \u201copen prayer\u201d as \u201cthat prayer which is for others to come unto or near, either in common churches or private chapels or oratories, commonly called the service of the Church.\u201d The Act of Uniformity 1549 was the first Act of its kind and was used to make religious worship across England and its territories consistent (i.e. uniform) at a time when the different branches of Christianity were pulling people in opposite directions, causing riots and crimes, particularly the Prayer Book Rebellion.  [[The Book of Common Prayer]] defined a middle ground for Christian [[faith]] within England; the Act of Uniformity 1549 mandated that all English subjects move to that middle ground, so that they could put aside their differences.\n\n==Preparation of the Act==\n''The Act of Uniformity'' 1549 had been prepared by a committee chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Cranmer]]. When this Bill was debated in the [[House of Lords]] in January 1549 it was very controversial. Of the eighteen bishops present at the final vote, ten voted in favour and eight against. Hostility to this Act and to the new prayer book led to rioting in some areas of the country, and a major uprising in [[Cornwall]] and the South West of England. They were resisted by Catholics on one side and radical reformers such as [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]] on the other. Yet, Edward VI stated in his Act: \n<blockquote>\n''that it may be ordained and enacted by his majesty, with the assent of the Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that all and singular person and persons that have offended concerning the premises, other than such person and persons as now be and remain in ward in the Tower of London, or in the Fleet, may be pardoned thereof;''<ref name=\"Gee 1896\"/>\n</blockquote>\nThese words assured that it was not an [[Ex post facto law]]. Only those already convicted would remain prosecuted.\n\n==Later History of the Act==\nThis Act was superseded in part by the [[Act of Uniformity 1552]] which introduced the more Protestant prayer book of 1552 and imposed penalties for unjustified absence from Sunday worship; repealed by Mary I, sess. 2, c. 2; and revived in a modified form by Elizabeth in the [[Act of Uniformity 1559]]. At the restoration of the monarchy with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] continued the major principles of 1549 in a rather different context and this later Act was reaffirmed in 1706 as a prelude to the Act of Union which united England and Scotland under one parliament. However, most of the Act of 1662 was repealed as part of the process of the removal of religious discrimination in the 19th century and the revision of statute law in the 20th.<ref>''Documents of the

''English Reformations'' Clarendon Press (1993) p. 173</ref>\n\nIt was the logical successor of the [[English Reformation#Royal Injunctions of 1547,2-17-19|Edwardian Injunctions of 1547]] and the [[Sacrament Act 1547|Sacrament Act]] of the same year which had taken piecemeal steps towards the official introduction of Protestant doctrine and practice into England and Wales.<ref>''Documents of the English Reformation'', Gerald Bray (ed)Cambridge, James Clark & C\u00ba(1994), pp 247ff</ref> It established the [[Book of Common Prayer (1549)|''Book of Common Prayer'']] as the sole legal form of worship in England. Before 1549, the churches of England used various different versions of the [[Latin]]-[[language]] [[Missal]].<ref>'''Concerning the Service of the Church''' (par. 5) in the Book of Common Prayer 1662</ref>\n\n==Nature of the Book of Common Prayer==\nThe Book of Common Prayer was far from just an English-language translation of the Latin [[liturgical book]]s; it was largely a new creation, mainly the work of Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]], which in its text and its ceremonial directions reflected various reforming doctrinal influences (notably the breviary of Cardinal Qui\u00f1onez and the ''Consultation'' of Hermann von Wied).<ref>Bp E.C.S Gibson in the introduction of ''The First and Second Prayer Books of Edward VI'', London J.M. Dent & Sons (1964), pp vi.ff</ref> The first Act (2 & 3 Edw 6 c 1) was called ''An Act for Uniformity of Service and Administration of the Sacraments throughout the Realm''. It deemed as follows:\n<blockquote>\n''and that all and singular ministers in any cathedral or parish church or other place within this realm of England, Wales, Calais, and the marches of the same, or other the king's dominions, shall, from and after the feast of Pentecost next coming, be bound to say and use the Matins, Evensong, celebration of the Lord's Supper, commonly called the Mass, and administration of each of the sacraments, and all their common and open prayer, in such order and form as is mentioned in the said book, and none other or otherwise''<ref name=\"Gee 1896\">Gee, Henry and Hardy, William J. ''Documents Illustrative of English Church History'', p. 360 London: Macmillan and Co, 1896.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThis section covers the following three points. England claimed many territories as its own with the phrase \u201cor other of the king\u2019s dominions\u201d.  And that there was plenty of time for England\u2019s territories to become accustomed to these new laws giving them approximately one year to use The Book of Common Prayer to unify the country behind a single common practice of Faith.\nThen follow penalties against those of the clergy that should substitute any other form of service, or shall not use The Book of Common Prayer, or who shall preach or speak against it: \n<blockquote>\n''lest any obstinate person who willingly would disturb so godly order and quiet in his realm should not go unpunished, that it may also be ordained and enacted by the authority aforesaid, that if any manner of parson, vicar, or other whatsoever minister, that ought or should sing or say common prayer mentioned in the said book, or minister the sacraments, shall after the said feast of Pentecost next coming refuse to use the said common prayers, or to minister the sacraments in such cathedral or parish church or other places as he should use or minister the same, in such order and form as they be mentioned and set forth in the said book or shall use, wilfully and obstinately standing in the same, any other rite, ceremony, order, form, or manner of Mass openly or privily, or Matins, Evensong, administration of the sacraments, or other open prayer that is mentioned and set forth in the said book; or shall preach, declare, or speak anything in the derogation or depraving of the said book, or anything therein contained, or of any part thereof; and shall be thereof lawfully convicted according to the laws of this realm, by verdict of twelve men, or by his own confession, or by the notorious evidence of the fact, shall lose and forfeit to the king's highness, his heirs and successors, for his first offence, the profit of such one of his spiritual benefices or promotions as it shall please the king's highness to assign or appoint, coming and arising in one whole year next after his conviction: and also that the same person so convicted shall for the same offence suffer imprisonment by the space of six months, without bail or mainprize.''<ref name=\"Gee 1896\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis provided loss of all income, which was forfeited to the Crown. Imprisonment \u201cwithout bail or mainprize\u201d meant one could not pay one's way out of prison, nor be given freedom until acquittal or the completion of the sentence.\n\nA second offence was dealt with more harshly: \n<blockquote>\n''and if any such person once convicted of any offence concerning the premises, shall after his first conviction again offend and be thereof in form aforesaid lawfully convicted, that then the same person shall for his second offence suffer imprisonment by the space of one whole year, and also shall therefore be deprived ipso facto of all his promotions; and that it shall be lawful to all patrons, donors, and grantees of all and singular the same spiritual promotions, to present to the same any other able clerk, in like manner and form as though the party so offending were dead;''<ref name=\"Gee P.361\">Gee, Henry and Hardy, William J. ''Documents Illustrative of English Church History'', p. 361  London: Macmillan and Co, 1896.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nA second offence added a year to the previous six months in prison, loss of livelihood, and any promotions and position would be given to another as if the miscreant had died.  A third offence was the harshest, punished by life in prison:\n<blockquote>\n''and that if any such person or persons, after he shall be twice convicted in form aforesaid, shall offend against any of the premises the third time, and shall be thereof in form aforesaid lawfully convicted, that then the person so offending and convicted the third time shall suffer imprisonment during his life.''<ref>Gee, Henry and Hardy, William J. ''Documents Illustrative of English Church History'', p. 363  London: Macmillan and Co, 1896.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nNothing in this Act enforced attendance at public worship, but the provisions of the Act apply to every kind of public worship or \u201copen prayer\u201d, as it was called, which might take place. The Act itself defines \u201copen prayer\u201d as \u201cthat prayer which is for others to come unto or near, either in common churches or private chapels or oratories, commonly called the service of the Church.\u201d The Act of Uniformity 1549 was the first Act of its kind and was used to make religious worship across England and its territories consistent (i.e. uniform) at a time when the different branches of Christianity were pulling people in opposite directions, causing riots and crimes, particularly the Prayer Book Rebellion.  [[The Book of Common Prayer]] defined a middle ground for Christian [[faith]] within England; the Act of Uniformity 1549 mandated that all English subjects move to that middle ground, so that they could put aside their differences.\n\n==Preparation of the Act==\n''The Act of Uniformity'' 1549 had been prepared by a committee chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Cranmer]]. When this Bill was debated in the [[House of Lords]] in January 1549 it was very controversial. Of the eighteen bishops present at the final vote, ten voted in favour and eight against. Hostility to this Act and to the new prayer book led to rioting in some areas of the country, and a major uprising in [[Cornwall]] and the South West of England. They were resisted by Catholics on one side and radical reformers such as [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]] on the other. Yet, Edward VI stated in his Act: \n<blockquote>\n''that it may be ordained and enacted by his majesty, with the assent of the Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that all and singular person and persons that have offended concerning the premises, other than such person and persons as now be and remain in ward in the Tower of London, or in the Fleet, may be pardoned thereof;''<ref name=\"Gee 1896\"/>\n</blockquote>\nThese words assured that it was not an [[Ex post facto law]]. Only those already convicted would remain prosecuted.\n\n==Later History of the Act==\nThis Act was superseded in part by the [[Act of Uniformity 1552]] which introduced the more Protestant prayer book of 1552 and imposed penalties for unjustified absence from Sunday worship; repealed by Mary I, sess. 2, c. 2; and revived in a modified form by Elizabeth in the [[Act of Uniformity 1559]]. At the restoration of the monarchy with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] continued the major principles of 1549 in a rather different context and this later Act was reaffirmed in 1706 as a prelude to the Act of Union which united England and Scotland under one parliament. However, most of the Act of 1662 was repealed as part of the process of the removal of religious discrimination in the 19th century and the revision of statute law in the 20th.<ref>''Documents of the
