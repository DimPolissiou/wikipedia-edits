{"title_page": "Late capitalism", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=March 2019}}\n\n{{Capitalism}}\n\n'''Late capitalism''' (or '''late-stage capitalism''') is a term first used in print by German economist [[Werner Sombart]] around the turn of the 20th century.<ref name=\"theatlantic_Lowrey_20170501\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/05/late-capitalism/524943/ |title=Why the Phrase 'Late Capitalism' Is Suddenly Everywhere: An investigation into a term that seems to perfectly capture the indignities and absurdities of the modern economy |first=Annie |last=Lowrey |magazine=The Atlantic |date=May 1, 2017 |access-date=November 29, 2019}}</ref> Since 2016, the term has been used in the United States and Canada to refer to perceived absurdities, contradictions, crises, injustices, and inequality created by modern business development.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nLater capitalism refers to the historical epoch since 1940, including the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion]] called the [[golden age of capitalism]]. The expression already existed for a long time in continental Europe, before it gained currency in the English-speaking world through the English translation of [[Ernest Mandel]]'s book ''Late Capitalism'', published in 1975.\n\nThe German original edition of Mandel's work was subtitled \"an attempt at an explanation\", meaning that Mandel tried to provide an orthodox [[Marxist]] explanation of the post-war epoch in terms of Marx's theory of [[capitalism]].   Mandel suggested   that important qualitative changes occurred within the capitalist system during and after World War II and that there are limits to capitalist development.\n\n==History of the term==\nThe term \"late capitalism\" was first used by [[Werner Sombart]] in his magnum opus ''Der Moderne Kapitalismus'', which was published from 1902 through 1927, and subsequent writings; Sombart divided capitalism into different stages: (1) proto-capitalist society from the early middle ages up to 1500 AD, (2) early capitalism in 1500\u20131800, (3) the heyday of capitalism (''Hochkapitalismus'') from 1800 to the first World War, and (4) late capitalism since then. Sombart's work was never translated into English, but historians sometimes do refer to ''late [[bourgeois society]]'' in contrast to ''early bourgeois society'' in the 17th and 18th century, or ''classical bourgeois society'' in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] famously declared that there are no \"absolutely hopeless situations\" for capitalism.<ref name=\"marxists_Lenin_1920\">{{citation |first=Vladimir Ilyich |last=Lenin |title=Report On The International Situation And The Fundamental Tasks Of The Communist International |date=July 19, 1920 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x03.htm |access-date=November 29, 2019}}</ref> The [[Communist International]] stated that with the first World War, a new world epoch of wars and revolutions had opened, and it defined [[state monopoly capitalism]] as the highest and final stage of capitalism.<ref name=\"marxists_Lenin_191606\">{{citation |first=Vladimir Ilyich |last=Lenin |title=Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism |date=June 1916 |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ |access-date=November 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''late capitalism'' began to be used by socialists in continental Europe towards the end of the 1930s and in the 1940s, when many economists believed capitalism was doomed.<ref>See, for example, [[Natalie Moszkowska]]'s ''[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6479733M/Zur_Dynamik_des_Spa%CC%88tkapitalismus Zur Dynamik des Sp\u00e4tkapitalismus]''. Zurich: Verlag Der Aufbruch, 1943.</ref> \nAt the end of [[World War II]], many economists, including [[Joseph Schumpeter]] and [[Paul Samuelson]], believed the end of capitalism could be near, in that the economic problems might be insurmountable.<ref>Philip Armstrong, Andrew Glyn and John Harrison, ''Capitalism Since World War II: The Making and Breakup of the Great Boom.'' Fontana, 1984, chapter 1.</ref>\n\nThe term was used in the 1960s in Germany and Austria, by Western Marxists writing in the tradition of the [[Frankfurt School]] and [[Austromarxism]]. \nLeo Michielsen and [[Andre Gorz]] popularized the term \"neo-capitalism\" in France and Belgium, with new analyses of the new post-war capitalism.<ref>Leo Michielsen, ''Neo-kapitalisme''. Brussel: Jacquemotte Stichting, 1969. Andr\u00e9 Gorz, ''Strat\u00e9gie ouvri\u00e9re et n\u00e9ocapitalisme'', Paris: Le Seuil, 1964.</ref> [[Jacques Derrida]] preferred ''[[neo-capitalism]]'' to ''post-'' or ''late-capitalism''.<ref>Catherine Malabou/Jacques Derrida, ''Counterpath'' (2004) p. 114\u2013115</ref>\n[[Theodor Adorno]] preferred \"late capitalism\" over \"industrial society,\" which was the theme of the 16th Congress of German Sociologists in 1968.<ref>Theodor W. Adorno (ed.) ''Sp\u00e4tkapitalismus oder Industriegesellschaft. Verhandlungen des 16. Deutschen Soziologentages.'' Stuttgart, 1969.</ref> \nIn 1971, [[Leo Kofler]] published a book called ''Technologische Rationalit\u00e4t im Sp\u00e4tkapitalismus'' (Technological Rationality in Late Capitalism). \n[[Claus Offe]] published his essay \"Sp\u00e4tkapitalismus - Versuch einer Begriffsbestimmung\" (Late capitalism - attempt at a conceptual definition) in 1972.<ref>[[Claus Offe]], ''Strukturprobleme ds kapitalistischen Staates''. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1972, pp. 7\u201325.</ref>  \nIn 1973, [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] published his ''Legitimationsprobleme im Sp\u00e4tkapitalismus'' (Legitimacy problems in late capitalism).<ref>J\u00fcrgen Habermas, ''Legitimationsprobleme im Sp\u00e4tkapitalismus'' Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1973.</ref> \nIn 1975, [[Ernest Mandel]] published his PhD thesis ''Late Capitalism'' in English at [[New Left Books]].\n[[Herbert Marcuse]] also accepted the term.<ref>[[Herbert Marcuse]], \"Protosocialism and Late Capitalism: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis Based on Bahro's Analysis\". ''International Journal of Politics'', Vol. 10 No. 2/3, Summer-Fall 1980,  25\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[Immanuel Wallerstein]] believes that capitalism may be in the process of being replaced by another [[world-systems theory|world system]].<ref>Michele Dillon, ''Introduction to Sociological Theory'' (2009) p. 39.</ref> The American literary critic and cultural theorist [[Frederic Jameson]] thought [[Rudolf Hilferding]]'s term ''the latest stage of capitalism'' (''j\u00fcngster Kapitalismus'') perhaps more prudent and less prophetic-sounding<ref>M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 257</ref> but Jameson often used \"late capitalism\" in his writings.\nHegel's theme of \"the end of history\" was rekindled by [[Koj\u00e8ve]] in his ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel''. The \"[[The End of History|end of history]]\" is discussed by [[Francis Fukuyama]] in the sense that [[liberal democracy]] is the ultimate form of society, which cannot be surpassed by anything that is superior to it, because there does not and cannot exist anything superior.\nIn modern usage, late capitalism often refers to a new mix of high-tech advances, the concentration of (speculative) financial capital, [[Post-Fordism]], and a growing gap between rich and poor.<ref>Harry Targ, ''Challenging late Capitalism, Neoliberal Globalization, & Militarism''.

The expression already existed for a long time in continental Europe, before it gained currency in the English-speaking world through the English translation of [[Ernest Mandel]]'s book ''Late Capitalism'', published in 1975.\n\nThe German original edition of Mandel's work was subtitled \"an attempt at an explanation\", meaning that Mandel tried to provide an orthodox [[Marxist]] explanation of the post-war epoch in terms of Marx's theory of [[capitalism]].   Mandel suggested   that important qualitative changes occurred within the capitalist system during and after World War II and that there are limits to capitalist development.\n\n==History of the term==\nThe term \"late capitalism\" was first used by [[Werner Sombart]] in his magnum opus ''Der Moderne Kapitalismus'', which was published from 1902 through 1927, and subsequent writings; Sombart divided capitalism into different stages: (1) proto-capitalist society from the early middle ages up to 1500 AD, (2) early capitalism in 1500\u20131800, (3) the heyday of capitalism (''Hochkapitalismus'') from 1800 to the first World War, and (4) late capitalism since then. Sombart's work was never translated into English, but historians sometimes do refer to ''late [[bourgeois society]]'' in contrast to ''early bourgeois society'' in the 17th and 18th century, or ''classical bourgeois society'' in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] famously declared that there are no \"absolutely hopeless situations\" for capitalism.<ref name=\"marxists_Lenin_1920\">{{citation |first=Vladimir Ilyich |last=Lenin |title=Report On The International Situation And The Fundamental Tasks Of The Communist International |date=July 19, 1920 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x03.htm |access-date=November 29, 2019}}</ref> The [[Communist International]] stated that with the first World War, a new world epoch of wars and revolutions had opened, and it defined [[state monopoly capitalism]] as the highest and final stage of capitalism.<ref name=\"marxists_Lenin_191606\">{{citation |first=Vladimir Ilyich |last=Lenin |title=Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism |date=June 1916 |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ |access-date=November 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''late capitalism'' began to be used by socialists in continental Europe towards the end of the 1930s and in the 1940s, when many economists believed capitalism was doomed.<ref>See, for example, [[Natalie Moszkowska]]'s ''[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6479733M/Zur_Dynamik_des_Spa%CC%88tkapitalismus Zur Dynamik des Sp\u00e4tkapitalismus]''.

After five years of business ventures, Stinson made [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] the focus of his future flying endeavors. Stinson found Detroit's business community receptive to his plans. A group of local businessmen \u2014 the Detroit Board of Commerce's Aviation Committee \u2014 supported Stinson's plans to establish the '''Stinson Aircraft Syndicate''' in 1925 at a site southwest of Detroit, where today's [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] is located, and provided $25,000 to develop a new [[monoplane]]; the [[Stinson Detroiter|SM-1 Detroiter]] made its first flight on January 25, 1926, and became an overnight success that enabled Stinson to quickly assemble $150,000 in public capital to incorporate the '''Stinson Aircraft Corporation''' on May 4, 1926. Always an aviator at heart, Eddie Stinson was still flying as a stunt pilot, earning $100,000 a year for his efforts \u2014 a huge sum in those days. Stinson Aircraft Corporation sold 10 SM-1 Detroiters in 1926. Business was steadily increasing, and Stinson delivered 121 aircraft in 1929.\n\nAutomobile [[Business magnate|mogul]] [[Errett Lobban Cord|Errett Lobban (E.L.) Cord]] acquired 60 percent of Stinson's stock in September 1929, and his [[Cord automobile|Cord Corporation]] provided additional investment capital to permit Stinson to sell its aircraft at a competitive price while still pursuing new designs. At the height of the Depression in 1930, Stinson offered six aircraft models, ranging from the four-seat Junior to the [[Stinson 6000]] trimotor airliner.\n\nEddie Stinson did not live to enjoy the success of his company. He died in an air crash in [[Chicago, Illinois]] on January 26, 1932, while on a sales trip. At the time of his death at age 38, Stinson had acquired more than 16,000 hours of flight time \u2014 more than any other pilot at the time.\n\nThe Stinson name did not last much past the end of World War II. Eddie Stinson's death accelerated the assimilation of Stinson Aircraft Corporation into larger corporate entities: first by Cord Corporation, then by [[Aviation Corporation]] (AVCO), and later by [[Consolidated Vultee]].<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=Flying Magazine|date=August 1945|page=78}}</ref> In 1948, the Stinson company was sold to the [[Piper Aircraft Corporation]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Stinson Aircraft Co.

After five years of business ventures, Stinson made [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] the focus of his future flying endeavors. Stinson found Detroit's business community receptive to his plans. A group of local businessmen \u2014 the Detroit Board of Commerce's Aviation Committee \u2014 supported Stinson's plans to establish the '''Stinson Aircraft Syndicate''' in 1925 at a site southwest of Detroit, where today's [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] is located, and provided $25,000 to develop a new [[monoplane]]; the [[Stinson Detroiter|SM-1 Detroiter]] made its first flight on January 25, 1926, and became an overnight success that enabled Stinson to quickly assemble $150,000 in public capital to incorporate the '''Stinson Aircraft Corporation''' on May 4, 1926. Always an aviator at heart, Eddie Stinson was still flying as a stunt pilot, earning $100,000 a year for his efforts \u2014 a huge sum in those days. Stinson Aircraft Corporation sold 10 SM-1 Detroiters in 1926. Business was steadily increasing, and Stinson delivered 121 aircraft in 1929.\n\nAutomobile [[Business magnate|mogul]] [[Errett Lobban Cord|Errett Lobban (E.L.) Cord]] acquired 60 percent of Stinson's stock in September 1929, and his [[Cord automobile|Cord Corporation]] provided additional investment capital to permit Stinson to sell its aircraft at a competitive price while still pursuing new designs. At the height of the Depression in 1930, Stinson offered six aircraft models, ranging from the four-seat Junior to the [[Stinson 6000]] trimotor airliner.\n\nEddie Stinson did not live to enjoy the success of his company. He died in an air crash in [[Chicago, Illinois]] on January 26, 1932, while on a sales trip. At the time of his death at age 38, Stinson had acquired more than 16,000 hours of flight time \u2014 more than any other pilot at the time.\n\nThe Stinson name did not last much past the end of World War II. Eddie Stinson's death accelerated the assimilation of Stinson Aircraft Corporation into larger corporate entities: first by Cord Corporation, then by [[Aviation Corporation]] (AVCO), and later by [[Consolidated Vultee]].<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=Flying Magazine|date=August 1945|page=78}}</ref> In 1948, the Stinson company was sold to the [[Piper Aircraft Corporation]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Stinson Aircraft Co.

It was released as the first single and second track of their debut album, ''[[Hybrid Theory]]''.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1847852|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com]</ref> The song was featured in the 2008 [[music video games]] ''[[Rock Band 2]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades]]'', and the soundtrack to the 2000 film ''[[Dracula 2000]]'' in the end credits.\n\nA remixed version of the song entitled \"1Stp Klosr\" was featured on Linkin Park's remix album, ''[[Reanimation (Linkin Park album)|Reanimation]]''. The remix features Johnathan Davis, the lead singer of nu metal band Korn.\n\nThis song was merged with another song off ''[[Hybrid Theory]]'', \"[[Points of Authority]]\" and \"[[99 Problems]]\" by [[Jay-Z]] on the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Collision Course (album)|Collision Course]]''.\n\n==Live performances==\nUntil 2007, Linkin Park has closed every concert to date with \"One Step Closer\", excluding [[Live 8 Philadelphia|Live 8]], and their live performances at Summer Sonic. In 2007, Linkin Park played \"One Step Closer\" toward the beginning of their live performances and sometimes at the end. The song is always played in [[Drop C# tuning|Drop C#]]. In 2008, they ended some of their shows with either \"One Step Closer\" or \"[[Bleed It Out]]\". In 2009, every show they played was ended with \"One Step Closer\", excluding the ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'' premiere.\n\nDuring the 2001 MTV VMA performance of the song, the band had [[the X-Ecutioners]] do an extended break before the bridge. This part was somewhat similar to the atmosphere on the remix, with synth parts and faint vocal parts being scratched.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2006, performances of the song include a verse originally sung by [[Korn]] frontman [[Jonathan Davis]] in the ''Reanimation'' remix of the song before the \"Shut up when I'm talking to you!\" [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], which can be heard on ''[[LP Underground 4.0]]''. At the end of the verse, Davis repeats the line \"Blood is pouring\" while the song builds up to the bridge. During their [[Projekt Revolution]] tour in 2004, the band actually got Jonathan Davis himself to sing his part on the song before [[Chester Bennington]] starts screaming his part.\n\nOn occasion, [[Mike Shinoda]] sings \"Blood is pouring\" under Bennington's screaming during this part, as is done by Jonathan Davis on the remix. This is half-done on the performance at 2004's [[Rock am Ring]] (in that Shinoda only sings the part during the second half of the bridge) and fully done during a performance during 2003's Projekt Revolution tour, which was completely recorded and included as a B-side on the \"[[Faint (song)|Faint]]\" single and is available as a bonus track for ''Reanimation'' when purchased on [[iTunes]]. On the single cover, it is called \"One Step Closer\" (Reanimated Live)\". It can also be heard on the Live from Nottingham Rock City 2003 Live from Nottingham record. During the 2006 live performances in Japan, the ''Reanimation'' bridge was played with the main riff of the song.\n\nDuring the band's 2007 tour, \"One Step Closer\" became the opening song of Linkin Park's performances, and the ''Reanimation'' verse was removed. It also featured a new, extended intro featuring Shinoda on rhythm guitar. In 2008, it had a new extended outro, and sometimes it was performed as the last song.\n\nFor the 2010 [[A Thousand Suns World Tour]], the song was used as the final song of the main Europe/North America set, with an extended outro featuring a guitar solo by Shinoda while [[Brad Delson]] played an extended rhythm section during the solo. In the main Australia set list, as well as many random sets, the song was the final song of the concerts.\nin 2017 they added new intro that was very similar to the one in 2007.\n\nOn October 30, 2017, Jonathan Davis performed the song again with the remaining Linkin Park members alongside former members Dead By Sunrise (a supergroup formed by Bennington himself) during the Chester Bennington Tribute Concert.\n\n==Music video==\n[[Joe Hahn]] of Linkin Park and director [[Gregory Dark]] came up with the concept for the video.

The video starts out with a group of teenage friends hanging out around a dark alley. Two of them (the male is played by local LA artist Tony Acosta who goes by the moniker \"TonyMech\") follow a strange man wearing a black hooded robe into a door which leads them to a dark, misty room where the band is playing. [[Monk]]-like men are performing martial arts moves throughout the video. Midway through the song, they knock over a crate, drawing the attention of the monk-like men, causing them to flee the tunnel. Eventually, the strange man appears at the end of the video. While Bennington screams the song's bridge, he is also upside-down as if gravity is inverted for him.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmUTBDuUGz8&ob=av2e | title = One Step Closer (Official Video) on YouTube}} from the Warner Bros.

It was released as the first single and second track of their debut album, ''[[Hybrid Theory]]''.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1847852|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com]</ref> The song was featured in the 2008 [[music video games]] ''[[Rock Band 2]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades]]'', and the soundtrack to the 2000 film ''[[Dracula 2000]]'' in the end credits.\n\nA remixed version of the song entitled \"1Stp Klosr\" was featured on Linkin Park's remix album, ''[[Reanimation (Linkin Park album)|Reanimation]]''. The remix features Johnathan Davis, the lead singer of nu metal band Korn.\n\nThis song was merged with another song off ''[[Hybrid Theory]]'', \"[[Points of Authority]]\" and \"[[99 Problems]]\" by [[Jay-Z]] on the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Collision Course (album)|Collision Course]]''.\n\n==Live performances==\nUntil 2007, Linkin Park has closed every concert to date with \"One Step Closer\", excluding [[Live 8 Philadelphia|Live 8]], and their live performances at Summer Sonic. In 2007, Linkin Park played \"One Step Closer\" toward the beginning of their live performances and sometimes at the end. The song is always played in [[Drop C# tuning|Drop C#]]. In 2008, they ended some of their shows with either \"One Step Closer\" or \"[[Bleed It Out]]\". In 2009, every show they played was ended with \"One Step Closer\", excluding the ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'' premiere.\n\nDuring the 2001 MTV VMA performance of the song, the band had [[the X-Ecutioners]] do an extended break before the bridge. This part was somewhat similar to the atmosphere on the remix, with synth parts and faint vocal parts being scratched.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2006, performances of the song include a verse originally sung by [[Korn]] frontman [[Jonathan Davis]] in the ''Reanimation'' remix of the song before the \"Shut up when I'm talking to you!\" [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], which can be heard on ''[[LP Underground 4.0]]''. At the end of the verse, Davis repeats the line \"Blood is pouring\" while the song builds up to the bridge. During their [[Projekt Revolution]] tour in 2004, the band actually got Jonathan Davis himself to sing his part on the song before [[Chester Bennington]] starts screaming his part.\n\nOn occasion, [[Mike Shinoda]] sings \"Blood is pouring\" under Bennington's screaming during this part, as is done by Jonathan Davis on the remix. This is half-done on the performance at 2004's [[Rock am Ring]] (in that Shinoda only sings the part during the second half of the bridge) and fully done during a performance during 2003's Projekt Revolution tour, which was completely recorded and included as a B-side on the \"[[Faint (song)|Faint]]\" single and is available as a bonus track for ''Reanimation'' when purchased on [[iTunes]]. On the single cover, it is called \"One Step Closer\" (Reanimated Live)\". It can also be heard on the Live from Nottingham Rock City 2003 Live from Nottingham record. During the 2006 live performances in Japan, the ''Reanimation'' bridge was played with the main riff of the song.\n\nDuring the band's 2007 tour, \"One Step Closer\" became the opening song of Linkin Park's performances, and the ''Reanimation'' verse was removed. It also featured a new, extended intro featuring Shinoda on rhythm guitar. In 2008, it had a new extended outro, and sometimes it was performed as the last song.\n\nFor the 2010 [[A Thousand Suns World Tour]], the song was used as the final song of the main Europe/North America set, with an extended outro featuring a guitar solo by Shinoda while [[Brad Delson]] played an extended rhythm section during the solo. In the main Australia set list, as well as many random sets, the song was the final song of the concerts.\nin 2017 they added new intro that was very similar to the one in 2007.\n\nOn October 30, 2017, Jonathan Davis performed the song again with the remaining Linkin Park members alongside former members Dead By Sunrise (a supergroup formed by Bennington himself) during the Chester Bennington Tribute Concert.\n\n==Music video==\n[[Joe Hahn]] of Linkin Park and director [[Gregory Dark]] came up with the concept for the video.
