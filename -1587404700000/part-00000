The voters include inducted Hall of Famers, the Hall of Fame committee members and selected members of the Track and Field Writers of America.<ref name=\"Hallof\" />  Each voter has one vote and any voter who fails to cast a ballot for two (2) consecutive years may be removed from the list of eligible voters until they request and cast a ballot in a subsequent year.  All ballots must be returned to the accounting firm responsible for tabulation of votes by August 29.<ref name=\"Hallof_a\" />  In the beginning of September, Accounting firm, chair of the Screening Committee, and President of the Board review the ballots and declare the inductees who are announced later in the month.<ref name=\"Hallof_a\" />\n\n==Museum==\n[[File:Fort-washington-armory.jpg|thumb|250px|Exterior of The Armory Building where the National Track & Field Hall of Fame is located.]]\nLocated at The Armory Foundation, at 216 Fort Washington Avenue in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights, New York]] the museum is split into three levels.

Although independent of the Athletic Department, the Pitt Alumni Association often coordinates with the Athletic Department and Panther Club in hosting events corresponding with both home and away athletic events.\n\n==Club sports==\nNumerous Pitt athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the student [[Collegiate club sports|club level]] without official sanction or sponsorship from the university's Department of Athletics. Although some are registered as official student organizations with the University of Pittsburgh Student Government Board and thus receive some small funding from that body, they are all largely

The 2005 season marked the first time the team qualified for the National Championship tournament. Since 2005, Pitt has qualified for the National Championship tournament (top 20 teams) for 14 consecutive seasons which has been highlighted in winning back-to-back  National Championships in 2012 and 2013, and playing for another national title in 2018. In addition to winning the 2012 and 2013 National Titles, the team has won 3 College Easterns Championships (2006, 2012, and 2015), 14 consecutive Western Pennsylvania Conference titles (2005\u20132018), and 7 Ohio Valley Regional Titles (2011\u20132015, 2017 and 2018).

The series began in 1905 and ended on September 16, 2000 with a 12\u20130 Pitt [[Heinz Field]] victory, but with Penn State leading the series 50\u201342\u20134. Although the two teams ended play for years due to long-standing coaching and administrative feuding, the rivalry remained heated among some fans. A revival of the rivalry is scheduled to resume for a four-game series in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://post-gazette.com/pg/11165/1153636-100-0.stm |title=Pitt, Penn State to renew football rivalry in 2016 |first=Ray |last=Fittipaldo |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=June 14, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2011}}</ref> Pitt athletic officials have publicly supported an annual renewal of the rivalry; however, Penn State has publicly countered that it is financially restricted from agreeing to a long-term series on a home-and-home basis. On December 10, 2016, Pitt and Penn State resumed competition in men's and women's basketball, with a win in the men's game and loss in the women's game. They compete in other sports as well as in recruiting.\n\n===West Virginia rivalry===\n{{main|Backyard Brawl}}\n[[File:PittWVUatExpoPark1908.jpg|thumb|right|The 1908 edition of the [[Backyard Brawl]] at [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]]]]\nPitt's biggest rivalry in recent years has been with [[West Virginia University]], which began with football games that date back to 1895, and spills across multiple sports. The annual contests are called the [[Backyard Brawl]] due to the proximity of the two schools' main campuses that are 57 miles apart ([[as the crow flies]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geobytes.com/CityDistanceTool.htm?d&pt_1=uspapitt&pt_2=uswvmorg|title=City Distance Calculator|work=Geobytes}}</ref> as well as the shared boundary between [[western Pennsylvania]] and [[North-Central West Virginia]] and the fact that both school reside in the same [[Media in Pittsburgh#DMA|Designated Market Area]]. The football rivalry represents the most played opponent for each school, and in recent seasons has been traditionally played on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] weekend, with the result often having implications both on the conference and national level. A men's basketball rivalry with WVU shared an intensity similar to that of the football one, and was also shared between the women's basketball teams as well. The rivalry had been relatively unique in college athletics in recent years as the two most high-profile sports, football and men's basketball, have resulted in games between teams have been all been nationally ranked in the same season. However, the football and basketball rivalries between the two schools were on hiatus due to Pitt and West Virginia moving into the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] and  [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] conferences, respectively. A four-year home and road football series has been scheduled from 2022\u201325. Since the 2017\u201318 season, an annual basketball series has resumed.  Most other sponsored varsity and club sports fielded by both schools also shared a similar rivalry, and some continue despite the conference realignment for both schools.\n\n===Duquesne rivalry===\n[[File:Citygametrophy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[City Game]] trophy]]\n{{main|City Game}}\nPitt and [[Duquesne University]] have had a long-standing rivalry in men's basketball that dates to 1932. Dubbed the [[City Game]], the inter-city rivalry pits the only two Division 1 basketball schools located within Pittsburgh's city limits. With their campuses located only three miles apart, it was the most intense basketball rivalry for both schools through the 1970s. The series currently scheduled to be held every year at the [[PPG Paints Arena]] and attracts significant local interest. Both schools' women's teams also play their annual version of the City Game. Prior to World War II, the schools were also rivals on the football field.\n\n===Notre Dame rivalry===\n{{main|Notre Dame\u2013Pittsburgh football rivalry}}\nPitt has a longstanding rivalry with the [[University of Notre Dame]]. Pitt has played Notre Dame on a semi-regular basis since 1899, with never more than three years passing between contests since 1943. The two universities recently are in the midst of a contract to play eight games between 2008 and 2015. Notre Dame is tied for Pitt's third most played opponent in football while Pitt is Notre Dame's fifth most played opponent. In other sports, Pitt and Notre Dame both compete against each other regularly as members of the Big East Conference and those competitions continue when both schools moved into the ACC.\n\n===Syracuse rivalry===\n{{main|Pittsburgh\u2013Syracuse football rivalry}}\nPitt has a long-standing rivalry with eastern football foe [[Syracuse University]], which also spills over onto the basketball court. Pitt and Syracuse have played in football without interruption since 1955, a streak that will continue when both schools move into the ACC and become designated cross-division rivals in that conference. Syracuse is tied as being Pitt's 3rd most played football opponent, while Pitt is Syracuse's second most played opponent. The basketball version of the rivalry dates to 1914 and has been played nearly 100 times.\n\n===Cincinnati rivalry===\n{{main|River City Rivalry}}\nIn 2005, Pitt began a football trophy rivalry with the [[University of Cincinnati]] Bearcats, dubbed the \"[[River City Rivalry]].\" This annual Big East Conference game stems from both cities being situated along the Ohio River and features a trophy of a riverboat telegraph (a device for signaling the boat's engine room).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cincinnati.scout.com/2/448518.html |title=River City Trophy Breakdown |last=Berk |first=Dave |date=October 6, 2005 |publisher=BearcatInsider.com |accessdate=July 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517035326/http://cincinnati.scout.com/2/448518.html |archivedate=May 17, 2009}}</ref> However, with Pitt being moved to the ACC in 2013, the series is on hiatus for the foreseeable future with Pitt leading the all-time series 8\u20134.\n\n===Other rivalries===\nPitt also has a significant basketball rivalry with the [[University of Connecticut]]. The Pitt and UConn rivalry first sparked with a last second win by then number one ranked Connecticut at Pitt's [[Fitzgerald Field House]] in 1998 that was followed by a crowd-displeasing emotional outburst by Connecticut's [[Khalid El-Amin]]. The rivalry took on new significance in the 2002 Big East Conference Tournament championship game that saw Pitt lose in double overtime. Pitt went on to avenge its loss the following season by defeating UConn in the 2003 Big East Championship game. Pitt and UConn also met for the championship in 2004 and have since played in many conference games of significance since. In the 2008\u20132009 season, Pitt earned its first win over the country's top-rated team by beating UConn on the road, and later at home while Connecticut was again ranked #1. However, the future of the rivalry is uncertain with Pitt's pending move to the ACC.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, Pitt had an intense basketball rivalry with cross-state school and fellow Big East Conference member [[Villanova University|Villanova]] that was touched off by recruiting battles over several high-profile players. The future of this series is also in doubt when Pitt moves into the ACC.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, a rivalry against [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Tech]] (now Carnegie Mellon University), as well as a regional rivalry with  [[Washington & Jefferson College]] ended following the deemphasis of the football and other athletic programs at those institutions post-World War II.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1941 Pitt football had a notable series with [[Fordham University]] which was then coached by [[Jim Crowley]] and featured guard [[Vince Lombardi]].

Although independent of the Athletic Department, the Pitt Alumni Association often coordinates with the Athletic Department and Panther Club in hosting events corresponding with both home and away athletic events.\n\n==Club sports==\nNumerous Pitt athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the student [[Collegiate club sports|club level]] without official sanction or sponsorship from the university's Department of Athletics. Although some are registered as official student organizations with the University of Pittsburgh Student Government Board and thus receive some small funding from that body, they are all largely

The 2005 season marked the first time the team qualified for the National Championship tournament. Since 2005, Pitt has qualified for the National Championship tournament (top 20 teams) for 14 consecutive seasons which has been highlighted in winning back-to-back  National Championships in 2012 and 2013, and playing for another national title in 2018. In addition to winning the 2012 and 2013 National Titles, the team has won 3 College Easterns Championships (2006, 2012, and 2015), 14 consecutive Western Pennsylvania Conference titles (2005\u20132018), and 7 Ohio Valley Regional Titles (2011\u20132015, 2017 and 2018).

The series began in 1905 and ended on September 16, 2000 with a 12\u20130 Pitt [[Heinz Field]] victory, but with Penn State leading the series 50\u201342\u20134. Although the two teams ended play for years due to long-standing coaching and administrative feuding, the rivalry remained heated among some fans. A revival of the rivalry is scheduled to resume for a four-game series in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://post-gazette.com/pg/11165/1153636-100-0.stm |title=Pitt, Penn State to renew football rivalry in 2016 |first=Ray |last=Fittipaldo |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=June 14, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2011}}</ref> Pitt athletic officials have publicly supported an annual renewal of the rivalry; however, Penn State has publicly countered that it is financially restricted from agreeing to a long-term series on a home-and-home basis. On December 10, 2016, Pitt and Penn State resumed competition in men's and women's basketball, with a win in the men's game and loss in the women's game. They compete in other sports as well as in recruiting.\n\n===West Virginia rivalry===\n{{main|Backyard Brawl}}\n[[File:PittWVUatExpoPark1908.jpg|thumb|right|The 1908 edition of the [[Backyard Brawl]] at [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]]]]\nPitt's biggest rivalry in recent years has been with [[West Virginia University]], which began with football games that date back to 1895, and spills across multiple sports. The annual contests are called the [[Backyard Brawl]] due to the proximity of the two schools' main campuses that are 57 miles apart ([[as the crow flies]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geobytes.com/CityDistanceTool.htm?d&pt_1=uspapitt&pt_2=uswvmorg|title=City Distance Calculator|work=Geobytes}}</ref> as well as the shared boundary between [[western Pennsylvania]] and [[North-Central West Virginia]] and the fact that both school reside in the same [[Media in Pittsburgh#DMA|Designated Market Area]]. The football rivalry represents the most played opponent for each school, and in recent seasons has been traditionally played on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] weekend, with the result often having implications both on the conference and national level. A men's basketball rivalry with WVU shared an intensity similar to that of the football one, and was also shared between the women's basketball teams as well. The rivalry had been relatively unique in college athletics in recent years as the two most high-profile sports, football and men's basketball, have resulted in games between teams have been all been nationally ranked in the same season. However, the football and basketball rivalries between the two schools were on hiatus due to Pitt and West Virginia moving into the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] and  [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] conferences, respectively. A four-year home and road football series has been scheduled from 2022\u201325. Since the 2017\u201318 season, an annual basketball series has resumed.  Most other sponsored varsity and club sports fielded by both schools also shared a similar rivalry, and some continue despite the conference realignment for both schools.\n\n===Duquesne rivalry===\n[[File:Citygametrophy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[City Game]] trophy]]\n{{main|City Game}}\nPitt and [[Duquesne University]] have had a long-standing rivalry in men's basketball that dates to 1932. Dubbed the [[City Game]], the inter-city rivalry pits the only two Division 1 basketball schools located within Pittsburgh's city limits. With their campuses located only three miles apart, it was the most intense basketball rivalry for both schools through the 1970s. The series currently scheduled to be held every year at the [[PPG Paints Arena]] and attracts significant local interest. Both schools' women's teams also play their annual version of the City Game. Prior to World War II, the schools were also rivals on the football field.\n\n===Notre Dame rivalry===\n{{main|Notre Dame\u2013Pittsburgh football rivalry}}\nPitt has a longstanding rivalry with the [[University of Notre Dame]]. Pitt has played Notre Dame on a semi-regular basis since 1899, with never more than three years passing between contests since 1943. The two universities recently are in the midst of a contract to play eight games between 2008 and 2015. Notre Dame is tied for Pitt's third most played opponent in football while Pitt is Notre Dame's fifth most played opponent. In other sports, Pitt and Notre Dame both compete against each other regularly as members of the Big East Conference and those competitions continue when both schools moved into the ACC.\n\n===Syracuse rivalry===\n{{main|Pittsburgh\u2013Syracuse football rivalry}}\nPitt has a long-standing rivalry with eastern football foe [[Syracuse University]], which also spills over onto the basketball court. Pitt and Syracuse have played in football without interruption since 1955, a streak that will continue when both schools move into the ACC and become designated cross-division rivals in that conference. Syracuse is tied as being Pitt's 3rd most played football opponent, while Pitt is Syracuse's second most played opponent. The basketball version of the rivalry dates to 1914 and has been played nearly 100 times.\n\n===Cincinnati rivalry===\n{{main|River City Rivalry}}\nIn 2005, Pitt began a football trophy rivalry with the [[University of Cincinnati]] Bearcats, dubbed the \"[[River City Rivalry]].\" This annual Big East Conference game stems from both cities being situated along the Ohio River and features a trophy of a riverboat telegraph (a device for signaling the boat's engine room).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cincinnati.scout.com/2/448518.html |title=River City Trophy Breakdown |last=Berk |first=Dave |date=October 6, 2005 |publisher=BearcatInsider.com |accessdate=July 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517035326/http://cincinnati.scout.com/2/448518.html |archivedate=May 17, 2009}}</ref> However, with Pitt being moved to the ACC in 2013, the series is on hiatus for the foreseeable future with Pitt leading the all-time series 8\u20134.\n\n===Other rivalries===\nPitt also has a significant basketball rivalry with the [[University of Connecticut]]. The Pitt and UConn rivalry first sparked with a last second win by then number one ranked Connecticut at Pitt's [[Fitzgerald Field House]] in 1998 that was followed by a crowd-displeasing emotional outburst by Connecticut's [[Khalid El-Amin]]. The rivalry took on new significance in the 2002 Big East Conference Tournament championship game that saw Pitt lose in double overtime. Pitt went on to avenge its loss the following season by defeating UConn in the 2003 Big East Championship game. Pitt and UConn also met for the championship in 2004 and have since played in many conference games of significance since. In the 2008\u20132009 season, Pitt earned its first win over the country's top-rated team by beating UConn on the road, and later at home while Connecticut was again ranked #1. However, the future of the rivalry is uncertain with Pitt's pending move to the ACC.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, Pitt had an intense basketball rivalry with cross-state school and fellow Big East Conference member [[Villanova University|Villanova]] that was touched off by recruiting battles over several high-profile players. The future of this series is also in doubt when Pitt moves into the ACC.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, a rivalry against [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Tech]] (now Carnegie Mellon University), as well as a regional rivalry with  [[Washington & Jefferson College]] ended following the deemphasis of the football and other athletic programs at those institutions post-World War II.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1941 Pitt football had a notable series with [[Fordham University]] which was then coached by [[Jim Crowley]] and featured guard [[Vince Lombardi]].
