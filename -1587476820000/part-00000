The song received [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]], [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song|Critics' Choice Movie Award]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe Award]] and [[Satellite Award for Best Original Song|Satellite Award]] nominations for Best Original Song, but lost each award to \"[[(I'm Gonna) Love Me Again]]\" from ''[[Rocketman (film)|Rocketman]]''.\n\n== Production ==\nAnderson-Lopez and Lopez, who wrote the songs for the 2013 animated film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', reprised their roles for the sequel ''Frozen II''. They also helped develop the story alongside [[Chris Buck]], [[Jennifer Lee (filmmaker)|Jennifer Lee]], and Marc E. Smith. Once a foundation for the story emerged, Anderson-Lopez and Lopez marked out points where songs would be used to move the story forward. The pair needed a song for a major moment for [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]]. Initially, the pair wrote a song called \"I Seek the Truth\" for the moment. At this point, the concept of Elsa hearing and following a mysterious voice had not been conceived yet. When this plot point was developed, the pair went back to the scene and wrote \"Into the Unknown\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/how-into-the-unknown-song-was-created-for-frozen-2-2019-11|title=The hit 'Frozen II' song 'Into the Unknown' wasn't originally in the movie|last=Guerrasio|first=Jason|date=2019-11-24|website=Business Insider Australia|language=en|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n\nMenzel first sang the song in her dressing room backstage at an off-Broadway play, with Anderson-Lopez and Lopez bringing in a [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]] to provide the music.<ref name=\"Into the Unknown first take\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-23/frozen-2-songwriters-idina-menzel-into-the-unknown|title='Frozen 2': Inside Idina Menzel's unglamorous first take of 'Into the Unknown'|date=2019-11-23|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n\n== Context ==\n{{Quote|text= It's an anthem that kids, and adults, can really relate to - that sense of, you're being called to go do something, but you don't know what it is or where it's going to lead you ...

The song received [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]], [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song|Critics' Choice Movie Award]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe Award]] and [[Satellite Award for Best Original Song|Satellite Award]] nominations for Best Original Song, but lost each award to \"[[(I'm Gonna) Love Me Again]]\" from ''[[Rocketman (film)|Rocketman]]''.\n\n== Production ==\nAnderson-Lopez and Lopez, who wrote the songs for the 2013 animated film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', reprised their roles for the sequel ''Frozen II''. They also helped develop the story alongside [[Chris Buck]], [[Jennifer Lee (filmmaker)|Jennifer Lee]], and Marc E. Smith. Once a foundation for the story emerged, Anderson-Lopez and Lopez marked out points where songs would be used to move the story forward. The pair needed a song for a major moment for [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]]. Initially, the pair wrote a song called \"I Seek the Truth\" for the moment. At this point, the concept of Elsa hearing and following a mysterious voice had not been conceived yet. When this plot point was developed, the pair went back to the scene and wrote \"Into the Unknown\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/how-into-the-unknown-song-was-created-for-frozen-2-2019-11|title=The hit 'Frozen II' song 'Into the Unknown' wasn't originally in the movie|last=Guerrasio|first=Jason|date=2019-11-24|website=Business Insider Australia|language=en|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n\nMenzel first sang the song in her dressing room backstage at an off-Broadway play, with Anderson-Lopez and Lopez bringing in a [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]] to provide the music.<ref name=\"Into the Unknown first take\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-23/frozen-2-songwriters-idina-menzel-into-the-unknown|title='Frozen 2': Inside Idina Menzel's unglamorous first take of 'Into the Unknown'|date=2019-11-23|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n\n== Context ==\n{{Quote|text= It's an anthem that kids, and adults, can really relate to - that sense of, you're being called to go do something, but you don't know what it is or where it's going to lead you ...

The bridge was designed by [[John Whitton]], the Engineer\u2013in\u2013Chief of [[New South Wales Government Railways]], and built from 1862 to 1867 by William Piper, Peto Brassey and Betts (superstructure), William Watkins (piers). It is also known as '''Victoria Bridge''', '''The Nepean Bridge''' and '''RTA Bridge No. 333'''. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 27 May 2016.<ref name=nswshr-1950>{{cite NSW SHR|5060797|Victoria Bridge|hr=01950|fn=EF14/22755|accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge initially carried rail and [[Horse-drawn vehicle|horse\u2013drawn traffic]], and was converted in 1907 to exclusively carry the Great Western Highway. The bridge is managed by [[Roads and Maritime Services]]. The bridge is the oldest surviving crossing of the [[Hawkesbury River|Hawkesbury]]\u2013Nepean River. As at 2009, Roads and Maritime Services estimated that Victoria Bridge carried an average daily traffic of 25,000 vehicles per day.<ref name=RMS>{{cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/sydney_region/western_sydney/victoria_bridge/index.html |title=Victoria Bridge |work=Road Projects |publisher=Roads and Maritime Services |date=October 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321061610/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/sydney_region/western_sydney/victoria_bridge/index.html |archive-date=21 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUntil 1856 travelers who wished to cross the [[Nepean River]] were required to use either the Emu Ford or a punt that was located south of the present day Victoria Bridge on Punt Road. This arrangement meant that in times of flood, travellers were often delayed at Penrith for days or even weeks waiting to cross the river. A small village developed near Emu Ford to cater to the people waiting to cross the river. With the discovery of gold west of the [[Great Dividing Range]] the flow of people, produce and animals through Penrith and across the river increased dramatically. It was no coincidence that attempts were made to build a permanent structure across the river, resulting in two timber road bridges located near to the eventual Victoria Bridge site being constructed.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nPrior to the construction of the Victoria Bridge, a punt service was located at the site of the bridge. Following the discovery of gold in the west of the Great Dividing Range demand for a permanent river crossing increased. A timber bridge was constructed with private funds, charging a toll for its use.\n\nIn 1850 the [[Government of New South Wales|Government]], reacting to lobbying by Penrith locals,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article228775622 |title=NOTICE is hereby given, that an application will he made to His Excellency the |newspaper=[[Government Gazette of the State of New South Wales|New South Wales Government Gazette]] |issue=55 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=26 April 1850 |page=693 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> passed an Act authorising the construction of a bridge at the western end of Jamison Road. This scheme never went ahead. A second Act was passed in 1851 authorising the formation of a company, allocating [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]6,000 for the construction of the bridge and allowing for the collection of tolls on the bridge. Following this act the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company was formed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230769800 |title=An Act to Incorporate a Company to be called the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company, and to enable the said Company to erect and maintain a Bridge over the River Nepean at Penrith, in direct continuation of the present line of the Great Western Road, and to take Toll thereat for a term of years; and for other purposes therein mentioned.

In August 1857 a flood carried away the four centre spans, no doubt due to the poor security of the mid-stream timber piles which reportedly were frayed like mop heads where McBeth had attempted to drive them into rock. McBeth had lacked experience and knowledge in bridge building and although the piles close to the bank went in easily, the mid-stream timber piles had struck rock and failed to achieve a secure penetration.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe Penrith Nepean Bridge Company decided to rebuild the bridge and employed an engineer named Moriarty to supervise the works. The construction contract was awarded to William Lockhart for A\u00a39,000. The piles that remained from the first bridge were utilised in the new bridge design, against the advice of both Lockhart and Moriarty. The new bridge was of a different, stronger design than the first and construction was completed in good time with the toll rights for one year selling for A\u00a32,850. The bridge withstood its first flood, but in 1860 the most devastating flood in New South Wales history until that time washed away the entire superstructure and deposited it on a bank down river. The structure was almost intact. Had the piles been replaced as originally suggested by the engineer and builder, the bridge might well have survived the flood. The Penrith Nepean Bridge Company was ruined by the destruction of the bridge and the directors lost large sums of money. Following the destruction of this second bridge the Government supplied two punts to convey people and goods across the river. The punts were irreparably damaged by a flood in 1867.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe loss of the punts coincided with a period in which the Great Western Railway was in the advanced planning stages, including plans for the construction of a bridge over the Nepean River to link Penrith with [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in the west, as part of the Penrith to Weatherboard Line (later [[Wentworth Falls, New South Wales|Wentworth Falls]]). It was decided that the required bridge would carry both a railway line and a single lane of road over the river, as a temporary solution.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n== Construction ==\nVictoria Bridge was designed by the Engineer-in-Chief of Railways in NSW, [[John Whitton]] and checked in Britain by his brother-in-law and renowned railway engineer, [[Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet|Sir John Fowler]]. Victoria Bridge was designed to carry two railway tracks as it was intended that the road on the bridge be only a temporary arrangement. The flood of 1860 that had carried off the previous bridge influenced Whitton to raise the bridge deck by {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} after witnessing the power of high flood waters.<ref name=nswshr-1950/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13149766 |title=THE NEPEAN |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=LV |issue=9074 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=24 June 1867 |accessdate=20 November 2016 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the bridge uses half through girders which are actually tall boxes made of riveted [[wrought iron]] plates was driven by the need to keep the underside of the bridge as shallow as possible to maximise headroom for flood clearance. The configuration of their boxes with their tall web plates, and upper box for lateral stability, reflected cutting edge design for the period. It utilised cutting edge of structural technology, using principles developed by Robert Stephenson in his design of the [[Britannia Bridge]] and the [[Conwy Railway Bridge]] in Wales; Thomas Telford and others who, by testing and theoretical work, developed techniques to prevent plate buckling by providing frequent vertical stiffeners, and sideways buckling of girders members by adding torsionally stiff boxes at the top and bottom. The first deep box girder bridge was designed by Stephenson and built across the [[Menai Strait]] in 1850. It was provided with suspension towers in case the deck was insufficiently strong and stiff, but the cables were never installed.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe construction contract for Victoria Bridge was split into several parts. One contract for the construction of the piers was awarded to William Tyler in 1862. He commenced work but flooding in 1863 and 1864 damaged his equipment and contributed to his abandonment of the contract in August 1864. The contract was subsequently awarded to W. Watkins for the sum of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]44,658. He completed the work before the agreed completion date and avoided the A\u00a350 per week penalty he would have incurred had he not delivered on time.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe ironwork for the bridge was supplied by Peto, Brassey and Betts of [[Birkenhead, England]] for A\u00a341,750. The same firm had supplied the ironwork for the [[Menangle Railway Bridge]] constructed on the Nepean River in 1863 and now the oldest surviving bridge on the NSW railway system. The timber approach viaduct for the Victoria Bridge was constructed by Mr Baillie at a cost of A\u00a38,716. Other small contracts for earthworks were also made bringing the total cost of the {{convert|1100|t|ST|0|adj=on}} iron bridge to approximately A\u00a3110,000.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nHigh floodwaters struck again soon after the bridge was opened in 1867, when the highest flood recorded until that time damaged the western timber approaches and washed away a portion of the spans and river bank. The main span however withstood this first major test and the flood waters did not reach the underside of the deck. A result of this flood a portion of the damaged timber viaduct was replaced by a shorter wrought iron box-girder span manufactured by the Thames Iron Company, [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]], [[London]]. The bridge was in operation as a rail bridge during the repair works and was re-opened to road traffic in 1869. The Victoria Bridge was considered to be of such modern design that it was featured in the \"Modern Examples of Road and Railway Bridges\" by Maw and Dredge in 1872.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>{{sfn|Maw|Dredge|1872}}\n\nVictoria Bridge had a significant impact on the local economy. Prior to its opening Penrith station formed the rail head of the western line, making Penrith a trade hub. The introduction of the road across the Nepean River diminished the business in the town previously brought in by travellers delayed in Penrith by poor river conditions. Conversely the opening of the bridge and the road and railway to the west enabled the growth of centres west of the mountains and the tourist industry of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] to become established.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nFollowing the increase in rail traffic on the Great Western Railway and the increase in the weight of locomotive engines, options were considered for the duplication of the railway line and of the Victoria Bridge. The possibility of using Victoria Bridge to carry two rail lines was considered. But this would have required the strengthening of the bridge by constructing intermediate piers between the existing piers of the bridge, thus halving the length of the spans. This technique had been applied to Victoria Bridge's sister structure the Menangle Bridge in 1907. It was however decided that the construction of a second bridge alongside the Victoria Bridge would be more appropriate and construction on a steel truss bridge was undertaken. The piers of the new bridge lined up with Victoria Bridge's existing piers in an attempt to minimise stresses on the structures during high river flows. In 1907 the railway bridge that now stands alongside Victoria Bridge was completed. With its completion the Victoria Bridge was converted to carry two lanes of traffic and a footway while the new bridge carried two rail lines.<ref name=nswshr-1950/> Originally it took one railway line and a road across the river, however in 1907 another bridge was constructed a few metres to the north which thenceforth took two railway lines across the river, and the original bridge reverted to road and pedestrian use only.<ref name=RTA>{{cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301653 |title=Victoria Bridge over Nepean River |work=RTA Heritage and Conservation Register |publisher=Roads and Traffic Authority |accessdate=19 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902224229/https://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301653 |archive-date=2 September 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the mid 1930s the timber approach spans of the bridge were discovered to be heavily deteriorated through termite attack and the approach spans were replaced with reinforced concrete trestles and a concrete deck supported by [[rolled steel joist]]s (RSJs).<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe site of Victoria Bridge has long been a centre of recreation in the Penrith region. From the 1850s it has been used for national and international rowing competitions.<ref name=nswshr-1950/> The bridge is significant in the development of the colony of NSW as it allowed the [[Main Western railway line, New South Wales|railway]], which previously terminated at Penrith, to reach the Railway Blue Mountains and beyond, as well as providing continuous road passage across the river using the Great Western Highway.<ref name=RTA/>\n\n==Current use==\nToday the bridge's significance as a road route to and from the Blue Mountains is diminished. The [[M4 Western Motorway]] has replaced the Great Western Highway as the main arterial route, crossing the Nepean River at [[Regentville, New South Wales|Regentville]]. The M4 and the Great Western Highway join/separate at [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone Hill]].\n\nThe bridge maintains its significance as a local tourist attraction and a centrepiece to sporting events along the Nepean River, as well as continuing to serve as vital link between the suburbs west of the Nepean, such as Emu Plains, and the major suburban centre of Penrith. The 1907 railway bridge still takes the Main Western and Blue Mountains railway lines over the river.\n\nAn undivided pedestrian pathway approximately {{convert|1.3|m}} is located adjacent to the roadway. Following community advocacy,<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://fixvictoriabridge.com.au/ |title=It's time for a safe crossing of the Nepean River at Victoria Bridge |work=Fix Victoria Bridge |accessdate=14 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409023121/http://fixvictoriabridge.com.au/ |archive-date=9 April 2013 |url-status=dead|df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> in 2010, Roads and Maritime Services commenced a feasibility study into a shared pedestrian/cyclist pathway over the bridge.<ref name=RMS/> By mid-2016 Roads and Maritime Services contracted Seymour Whyte Constructions Pty Ltd to build a pedestrian and cyclist bridge over the Nepean River, south of the Victoria Bridge, to connect Penrith and Emu Plains.

The three main girders, each spanning a clear {{convert|56.7|m}}, were designed and constructed as one {{convert|181|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-long}} continuous structure (no separations over the [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]), a novel structural feature for 1867.{{sfn|Maw|Dredge|1872}} This structure, supported by hollow stone piers at {{convert|60.35|m}} centres, has iron cross girders which support a concrete deck, {{convert|3.5|m}} below the tops of the main girders which are {{convert|3.95|m}} deep. Each [[Span (architecture)|span]] has a camber of {{convert|100|mm}}. There is a secondary, shorter, shallower, simply-supported girder, {{convert|41.1|m}} long at the western (Emu Plains) end of the bridge. All four iron girders have pairs of hollow boxes top and bottom separated by two web plates, an early version of box-girder construction. They are all of riveted construction. The total weight of [[wrought iron]] is approximately {{convert|1100|t|ST|0}}.{{sfn|Maw|Dredge|1872}}<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge consists of three main spans of iron box girder, one secondary span of iron box girder and three concrete approach spans on either side of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe piers that support the main spans are constructed of [[Sydney sandstone]], the pier supporting the western end of the secondary iron girder span is constructed of mass concrete. The piers supporting the approach spans are constructed of concrete trestle frames. Piped services are supported under the pedestrian walkway portion of the deck and a large pipe is supported on the top flange of one of the main girders.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nT-section shaped stiffeners can be seen running vertically down the sides of the girders at the bearing ends. There are five stiffeners over the central piers and three over outer piers. Stiffeners prevent the thin web plates from buckling vertically.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nArchitectural curved angle sections appear on the outer face of the girders of the main span. These serve no structural function but \"lighten the appearance of the structure\"<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThere are flood markers on the side of the easternmost sandstone pier. The remnants of old light posts can be seen on the piers on the northern side of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThere are modern street light posts and lights on the southern piers of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 1 December 2008, the fabric of the bridge is generally in very good condition. There is little sign of rust on iron elements and concrete and stone elements also appear to be in good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe remains of the piles of the earlier bridges may still be embedded in the riverbed. There is also the possibility that relics of the construction platforms, crane bases or [[coffer]] damns used to construct Victoria Bridge may be found in the riverbed.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge has undergone several alterations in its life so far. The bulk of the bridge however remains intact.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe bridge has undergone several alterations in its life so far. The bulk of the bridge however remains intact.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1869 - Western approach spans were rebuilt following damage of the original timber approach spans by flood two weeks after the bridge was opened. The new spans were of a similar design to the main spans but with cast iron caisson piers.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*{{circa|1870}}-90 - The original road surface was close-fitting timber planking, wheel guides were installed early in the life of the bridge to help horse and bullock drawn vehicles drive in a straight line on the timber boards.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1883 - a galvanised iron fence was installed between the single railway track and the single lane road portion of the bridge. Around this time a warning bell was also installed to warn of approaching trains. This was installed after several incidents on the bridge involving livestock on the bridge being disturbed by passing trains.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1907 - new double track railway bridge was opened and the single railway line was removed from Victoria Bridge. The deck was also reconstructed to accommodate two lanes of traffic.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1934 - Approach spans and abutments reconstructed in steel and concrete<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*19?? - The footway across the main spans reconstructed to provide for utility pipes.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 18 March 2015, Victoria Bridge is of state heritage significance as one of only three bridges of its type that were ever constructed in NSW, of which only two remain ('wrought iron-through girder'). Although two bridges of this type still remain, Victoria Bridge is unique in NSW due to the intactness of its form compared to Menangle bridge, which has undergone significant alterations to its structural form through the addition of intermediate piers.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nVictoria bridge represents a type of bridge that was considered to be the cutting edge of technology when it was designed in 1862. Design principles used in Victoria Bridge were pioneered by Robert Stephenson in his design of the Britannia Bridge and The Conwy Bridge in Britain. In addition to this prestigious design history, Victoria Bridge has the largest spans of any metal girder bridge in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge is of state significance due to its role in bridging the Nepean River for the Great Western Railway. Victoria Bridge was a key element in bringing the railways to western NSW. The bridge's association with the designer of the Great Western Railway, John Whitton is also of significance.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nVictoria Bridge (Penrith) was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 27 May 2016 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state significance for its historical role as a vital element in the development of key road and rail transport routes across NSW from the 1860s and 1870s. In particular this includes the Great Western Railway line which opened up the western regions of the NSW, and made a significant contribution to improving trade flow across the state. As a road bridge it places a significant role in the story of crossing of the flood prone Nepean River, and was the first successful bridge crossing at Penrith. In addition to the wider advantages the bridge brought for transport across the state, it also has local significance for its economically on local workers and economies.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state significance for its association with its designer John Whitton, Engineer-in Chief for the NSW Railways, who also designed the Great Western Railway and the [[Zig Zag Railway]] at [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]] and [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]]. Mr Whitton was an outstanding engineer of his time and was also responsible for overseeing construction of the bridge and the railway line between Penrith and Wentworth Falls. It is also associated with the renowned British engineer John Fowler, of Firth of Forth Bridge Fame, who checked Whitton's design and plans and supervised the fabrication of the bridge in England.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state aesthetic significance because its design was based on important principles pioneered by Robert Stephenson on the Britannia Bridge and the Conwy Bridge in Wales. It is the most intact of only two iron through girder bridges built in NSW. Menangle Bridge now has intermediate piers and so no longer has its original form. Victoria Bridge is the only one of its type still operating with the same structural system that it was built with. The bridge has been an important landmark in Penrith since its construction.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge has state technical and aesthetic significance. Whitton's design employed the latest in British Bridge technology, utilising the through girder form, reinforced with boxes at the top and bottom of the girders, and long continuous spans to achieve maximum waterway, a feature of major importance at this site. The construction of the bridge constituted a major project carried out under extremely difficult circumstances. The bridge has strong and bold lines, providing a reassure presence in a landscape continually attacked by high floods which destroyed two previous bridges. It is a highly visually distinctive structure, and its enclosing form has always provided a distinctive travel experience, whether crossing by train, horse-drawn vehicle, motor vehicle or on foot. The Victoria Bridge and the visually complementary adjacent rail bridge form a landmark from both the Great Western highway and from the Nepean River and its banks. Both bridges are visually articulate about their structural properties and together, through their contrasting forms, provide an essay on the developments in metal bridge design across the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe quality and longevity of the bridge is evidence of Whitton's correct understanding of the power of the Nepean and his enormous commitment to build railways of a high standard, employing cutting edge British technology in a colony barely out of its infancy. The high level of the bridge and its robust stone piers, as well as s the iron span on the western end of the bridge added after its initial completion are articulate about the devastating potential of the river and the high level of persistence intelligence and investment required to bridge it.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nPublic esteem for the bridge and an enduring interest in its management and use over its lifetime has imbued Victoria Bridge with social significance at a State level. Its historic, technical and aesthetic qualities are widely recognised within the Penrith, [[Sydney]] and Blue Mountains communities and more widely among railway and bridge enthusiasts and historians. It forms a landmark in the Penrith area and has been the centrepiece of the tourist and sporting activities of the Nepean which have attracted boating parties, swimmers, rowers, spectators and picnickers from a wide catchment area.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge has local significance as a place of recreation. It is significant to the Heritage Engineers of Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge has research significance at a State level as one of the oldest metal bridges in Australia. Together with the [[Menangle Railway Bridge]] and [[Prince Alfred Bridge]] at [[Gundagai]], it is an important benchmark in early metal bridge design and construction practices giving insight into these activities which would be difficult to gain from other sources. With the largest spans of any metal girder bridge in NSW and being the most intact of two remaining bridges in the state of this type, the Victoria Bridge is of state significance for its research potential to illustrate the design and construction techniques of this type of bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state significance as the only \"iron-through girder\" bridge that has not been significantly altered, making it unique in NSW. It was one of three iron box-girder bridges built in NSW and one of only two surviving bridges, the other being at Menangle. The third, being an 1869 single span over the [[Wollondilly River]] near [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], was demolished after duplication of the Great Southern Railway in 1914. The bridge also has State significance more generally as one of the oldest metal bridges in NSW and Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nIt is of state significance because it is representative of the cutting edge of bridge design in 1864 and is representative of early wrought iron heavy bridge design. It also represents the importance of high quality bridge design in the opening up of Western NSW to the railway.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nPenrith Australia.jpg|The railway bridge, to the north of the Victoria Bridge, operational from 1907.\nVictoria Bridge - Nepean River - Penrith NSW (5554676422).jpg|Victoria Bridge - Nepean River - Penrith\nVictoriabridgepenrith1.jpg|Victoria Bridge - Nepean River - Penrith\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Transport|Engineering|New South Wales|Australian roads}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Sydney]]\n* [[List of places named after Queen Victoria]]\n* [[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=Article}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=Article |page=36}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=Penrith Valley Heritage Drive}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=National Trust Item Sheet}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=RTA Bridge File 5/358.123 t1}}\n* {{cite web|author=|date=|title=The Nepean Times 14 April 1882 & 1883, 26 Jan 1884, 19 Apr 1884, 28 June 1884, 20 December 1884|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cardno|first=M.

heritage-listed former [[railway bridge]] and now [[wrought iron]] box [[plate girder bridge|plate girder]] [[road bridge]] across the [[Nepean River]] on the [[Great Western Highway]] in the [[Greater Western Sydney|western]] [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] in the [[City of Penrith]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. The bridge was designed by [[John Whitton]], the Engineer\u2013in\u2013Chief of [[New South Wales Government Railways]], and built from 1862 to 1867 by William Piper, Peto Brassey and Betts (superstructure), William Watkins (piers). It is also known as '''Victoria Bridge''', '''The Nepean Bridge''' and '''RTA Bridge No. 333'''. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 27 May 2016.<ref name=nswshr-1950>{{cite NSW SHR|5060797|Victoria Bridge|hr=01950|fn=EF14/22755|accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge initially carried rail and [[Horse-drawn vehicle|horse\u2013drawn traffic]], and was converted in 1907 to exclusively carry the Great Western Highway. The bridge is managed by [[Roads and Maritime Services]]. The bridge is the oldest surviving crossing of the [[Hawkesbury River|Hawkesbury]]\u2013Nepean River. As at 2009, Roads and Maritime Services estimated that Victoria Bridge carried an average daily traffic of 25,000 vehicles per day.<ref name=RMS>{{cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/sydney_region/western_sydney/victoria_bridge/index.html |title=Victoria Bridge |work=Road Projects |publisher=Roads and Maritime Services |date=October 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321061610/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/sydney_region/western_sydney/victoria_bridge/index.html |archive-date=21 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUntil 1856 travelers who wished to cross the [[Nepean River]] were required to use either the Emu Ford or a punt that was located south of the present day Victoria Bridge on Punt Road. This arrangement meant that in times of flood, travellers were often delayed at Penrith for days or even weeks waiting to cross the river. A small village developed near Emu Ford to cater to the people waiting to cross the river. With the discovery of gold west of the [[Great Dividing Range]] the flow of people, produce and animals through Penrith and across the river increased dramatically. It was no coincidence that attempts were made to build a permanent structure across the river, resulting in two timber road bridges located near to the eventual Victoria Bridge site being constructed.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nPrior to the construction of the Victoria Bridge, a punt service was located at the site of the bridge. Following the discovery of gold in the west of the Great Dividing Range demand for a permanent river crossing increased. A timber bridge was constructed with private funds, charging a toll for its use.\n\nIn 1850 the [[Government of New South Wales|Government]], reacting to lobbying by Penrith locals,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article228775622 |title=NOTICE is hereby given, that an application will he made to His Excellency the |newspaper=[[Government Gazette of the State of New South Wales|New South Wales Government Gazette]] |issue=55 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=26 April 1850 |page=693 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> passed an Act authorising the construction of a bridge at the western end of Jamison Road. This scheme never went ahead. A second Act was passed in 1851 authorising the formation of a company, allocating [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]6,000 for the construction of the bridge and allowing for the collection of tolls on the bridge. Following this act the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company was formed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230769800 |title=An Act to Incorporate a Company to be called the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company, and to enable the said Company to erect and maintain a Bridge over the River Nepean at Penrith, in direct continuation of the present line of the Great Western Road, and to take Toll thereat for a term of years; and for other purposes therein mentioned.

The first directors of the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company were local entrepreneurs Robert Fitzgerald, James Thomas Ryan, Edwin Rouse, John Perry, Charles York, Henry Hall, Alexander Fraser. Construction of the bridge was under the supervision of David McBeth, a Scottish surveyor.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge, completed in December 1855, was {{convert|700|ft|m|0|order=flip}} long and {{convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}} wide, becoming the first bridge across the Nepean River in the area.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60171836 |title=OPENING OF THE PENRITH VICTORIA BRIDGE. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|The Empire]] |issue=1554 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=2 January 1856 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> McBeth received a A\u00a3200 bonus on top of his A\u00a3300 salary for the timely completion of the works, the toll rights for the first year were sold by the Penrith Nepean Bridge Company for A\u00a32,250 and traffic flowed across the bridge.

In August 1857 a flood carried away the four centre spans, no doubt due to the poor security of the mid-stream timber piles which reportedly were frayed like mop heads where McBeth had attempted to drive them into rock. McBeth had lacked experience and knowledge in bridge building and although the piles close to the bank went in easily, the mid-stream timber piles had struck rock and failed to achieve a secure penetration.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe Penrith Nepean Bridge Company decided to rebuild the bridge and employed an engineer named Moriarty to supervise the works. The construction contract was awarded to William Lockhart for A\u00a39,000. The piles that remained from the first bridge were utilised in the new bridge design, against the advice of both Lockhart and Moriarty. The new bridge was of a different, stronger design than the first and construction was completed in good time with the toll rights for one year selling for A\u00a32,850. The bridge withstood its first flood, but in 1860 the most devastating flood in New South Wales history until that time washed away the entire superstructure and deposited it on a bank down river. The structure was almost intact. Had the piles been replaced as originally suggested by the engineer and builder, the bridge might well have survived the flood. The Penrith Nepean Bridge Company was ruined by the destruction of the bridge and the directors lost large sums of money. Following the destruction of this second bridge the Government supplied two punts to convey people and goods across the river. The punts were irreparably damaged by a flood in 1867.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe loss of the punts coincided with a period in which the Great Western Railway was in the advanced planning stages, including plans for the construction of a bridge over the Nepean River to link Penrith with [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in the west, as part of the Penrith to Weatherboard Line (later [[Wentworth Falls, New South Wales|Wentworth Falls]]). It was decided that the required bridge would carry both a railway line and a single lane of road over the river, as a temporary solution.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n== Construction ==\nVictoria Bridge was designed by the Engineer-in-Chief of Railways in NSW, [[John Whitton]] and checked in Britain by his brother-in-law and renowned railway engineer, [[Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet|Sir John Fowler]]. Victoria Bridge was designed to carry two railway tracks as it was intended that the road on the bridge be only a temporary arrangement. The flood of 1860 that had carried off the previous bridge influenced Whitton to raise the bridge deck by {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} after witnessing the power of high flood waters.<ref name=nswshr-1950/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13149766 |title=THE NEPEAN |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=LV |issue=9074 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=24 June 1867 |accessdate=20 November 2016 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the bridge uses half through girders which are actually tall boxes made of riveted [[wrought iron]] plates was driven by the need to keep the underside of the bridge as shallow as possible to maximise headroom for flood clearance. The configuration of their boxes with their tall web plates, and upper box for lateral stability, reflected cutting edge design for the period. It utilised cutting edge of structural technology, using principles developed by Robert Stephenson in his design of the [[Britannia Bridge]] and the [[Conwy Railway Bridge]] in Wales; Thomas Telford and others who, by testing and theoretical work, developed techniques to prevent plate buckling by providing frequent vertical stiffeners, and sideways buckling of girders members by adding torsionally stiff boxes at the top and bottom. The first deep box girder bridge was designed by Stephenson and built across the [[Menai Strait]] in 1850. It was provided with suspension towers in case the deck was insufficiently strong and stiff, but the cables were never installed.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe construction contract for Victoria Bridge was split into several parts. One contract for the construction of the piers was awarded to William Tyler in 1862. He commenced work but flooding in 1863 and 1864 damaged his equipment and contributed to his abandonment of the contract in August 1864. The contract was subsequently awarded to W. Watkins for the sum of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]44,658. He completed the work before the agreed completion date and avoided the A\u00a350 per week penalty he would have incurred had he not delivered on time.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe ironwork for the bridge was supplied by Peto, Brassey and Betts of [[Birkenhead, England]] for A\u00a341,750. The same firm had supplied the ironwork for the [[Menangle Railway Bridge]] constructed on the Nepean River in 1863 and now the oldest surviving bridge on the NSW railway system. The timber approach viaduct for the Victoria Bridge was constructed by Mr Baillie at a cost of A\u00a38,716. Other small contracts for earthworks were also made bringing the total cost of the {{convert|1100|t|ST|0|adj=on}} iron bridge to approximately A\u00a3110,000.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nHigh floodwaters struck again soon after the bridge was opened in 1867, when the highest flood recorded until that time damaged the western timber approaches and washed away a portion of the spans and river bank. The main span however withstood this first major test and the flood waters did not reach the underside of the deck. A result of this flood a portion of the damaged timber viaduct was replaced by a shorter wrought iron box-girder span manufactured by the Thames Iron Company, [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]], [[London]]. The bridge was in operation as a rail bridge during the repair works and was re-opened to road traffic in 1869. The Victoria Bridge was considered to be of such modern design that it was featured in the \"Modern Examples of Road and Railway Bridges\" by Maw and Dredge in 1872.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>{{sfn|Maw|Dredge|1872}}\n\nVictoria Bridge had a significant impact on the local economy. Prior to its opening Penrith station formed the rail head of the western line, making Penrith a trade hub. The introduction of the road across the Nepean River diminished the business in the town previously brought in by travellers delayed in Penrith by poor river conditions. Conversely the opening of the bridge and the road and railway to the west enabled the growth of centres west of the mountains and the tourist industry of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] to become established.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nFollowing the increase in rail traffic on the Great Western Railway and the increase in the weight of locomotive engines, options were considered for the duplication of the railway line and of the Victoria Bridge. The possibility of using Victoria Bridge to carry two rail lines was considered. But this would have required the strengthening of the bridge by constructing intermediate piers between the existing piers of the bridge, thus halving the length of the spans. This technique had been applied to Victoria Bridge's sister structure the Menangle Bridge in 1907. It was however decided that the construction of a second bridge alongside the Victoria Bridge would be more appropriate and construction on a steel truss bridge was undertaken. The piers of the new bridge lined up with Victoria Bridge's existing piers in an attempt to minimise stresses on the structures during high river flows. In 1907 the railway bridge that now stands alongside Victoria Bridge was completed. With its completion the Victoria Bridge was converted to carry two lanes of traffic and a footway while the new bridge carried two rail lines.<ref name=nswshr-1950/> Originally it took one railway line and a road across the river, however in 1907 another bridge was constructed a few metres to the north which thenceforth took two railway lines across the river, and the original bridge reverted to road and pedestrian use only.<ref name=RTA>{{cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301653 |title=Victoria Bridge over Nepean River |work=RTA Heritage and Conservation Register |publisher=Roads and Traffic Authority |accessdate=19 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902224229/https://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301653 |archive-date=2 September 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the mid 1930s the timber approach spans of the bridge were discovered to be heavily deteriorated through termite attack and the approach spans were replaced with reinforced concrete trestles and a concrete deck supported by [[rolled steel joist]]s (RSJs).<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe site of Victoria Bridge has long been a centre of recreation in the Penrith region. From the 1850s it has been used for national and international rowing competitions.<ref name=nswshr-1950/> The bridge is significant in the development of the colony of NSW as it allowed the [[Main Western railway line, New South Wales|railway]], which previously terminated at Penrith, to reach the Railway Blue Mountains and beyond, as well as providing continuous road passage across the river using the Great Western Highway.<ref name=RTA/>\n\n==Current use==\nToday the bridge's significance as a road route to and from the Blue Mountains is diminished. The [[M4 Western Motorway]] has replaced the Great Western Highway as the main arterial route, crossing the Nepean River at [[Regentville, New South Wales|Regentville]]. The M4 and the Great Western Highway join/separate at [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone Hill]].\n\nThe bridge maintains its significance as a local tourist attraction and a centrepiece to sporting events along the Nepean River, as well as continuing to serve as vital link between the suburbs west of the Nepean, such as Emu Plains, and the major suburban centre of Penrith. The 1907 railway bridge still takes the Main Western and Blue Mountains railway lines over the river.\n\nAn undivided pedestrian pathway approximately {{convert|1.3|m}} is located adjacent to the roadway. Following community advocacy,<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://fixvictoriabridge.com.au/ |title=It's time for a safe crossing of the Nepean River at Victoria Bridge |work=Fix Victoria Bridge |accessdate=14 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409023121/http://fixvictoriabridge.com.au/ |archive-date=9 April 2013 |url-status=dead|df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> in 2010, Roads and Maritime Services commenced a feasibility study into a shared pedestrian/cyclist pathway over the bridge.<ref name=RMS/> By mid-2016 Roads and Maritime Services contracted Seymour Whyte Constructions Pty Ltd to build a pedestrian and cyclist bridge over the Nepean River, south of the Victoria Bridge, to connect Penrith and Emu Plains.

The three main girders, each spanning a clear {{convert|56.7|m}}, were designed and constructed as one {{convert|181|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-long}} continuous structure (no separations over the [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]), a novel structural feature for 1867.{{sfn|Maw|Dredge|1872}} This structure, supported by hollow stone piers at {{convert|60.35|m}} centres, has iron cross girders which support a concrete deck, {{convert|3.5|m}} below the tops of the main girders which are {{convert|3.95|m}} deep. Each [[Span (architecture)|span]] has a camber of {{convert|100|mm}}. There is a secondary, shorter, shallower, simply-supported girder, {{convert|41.1|m}} long at the western (Emu Plains) end of the bridge. All four iron girders have pairs of hollow boxes top and bottom separated by two web plates, an early version of box-girder construction. They are all of riveted construction. The total weight of [[wrought iron]] is approximately {{convert|1100|t|ST|0}}.{{sfn|Maw|Dredge|1872}}<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge consists of three main spans of iron box girder, one secondary span of iron box girder and three concrete approach spans on either side of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe piers that support the main spans are constructed of [[Sydney sandstone]], the pier supporting the western end of the secondary iron girder span is constructed of mass concrete. The piers supporting the approach spans are constructed of concrete trestle frames. Piped services are supported under the pedestrian walkway portion of the deck and a large pipe is supported on the top flange of one of the main girders.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nT-section shaped stiffeners can be seen running vertically down the sides of the girders at the bearing ends. There are five stiffeners over the central piers and three over outer piers. Stiffeners prevent the thin web plates from buckling vertically.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nArchitectural curved angle sections appear on the outer face of the girders of the main span. These serve no structural function but \"lighten the appearance of the structure\"<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThere are flood markers on the side of the easternmost sandstone pier. The remnants of old light posts can be seen on the piers on the northern side of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThere are modern street light posts and lights on the southern piers of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 1 December 2008, the fabric of the bridge is generally in very good condition. There is little sign of rust on iron elements and concrete and stone elements also appear to be in good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe remains of the piles of the earlier bridges may still be embedded in the riverbed. There is also the possibility that relics of the construction platforms, crane bases or [[coffer]] damns used to construct Victoria Bridge may be found in the riverbed.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge has undergone several alterations in its life so far. The bulk of the bridge however remains intact.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe bridge has undergone several alterations in its life so far. The bulk of the bridge however remains intact.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1869 - Western approach spans were rebuilt following damage of the original timber approach spans by flood two weeks after the bridge was opened. The new spans were of a similar design to the main spans but with cast iron caisson piers.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*{{circa|1870}}-90 - The original road surface was close-fitting timber planking, wheel guides were installed early in the life of the bridge to help horse and bullock drawn vehicles drive in a straight line on the timber boards.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1883 - a galvanised iron fence was installed between the single railway track and the single lane road portion of the bridge. Around this time a warning bell was also installed to warn of approaching trains. This was installed after several incidents on the bridge involving livestock on the bridge being disturbed by passing trains.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n*1907 - new double track railway bridge was opened and the single railway line was removed from Victoria Bridge.

Although two bridges of this type still remain, Victoria Bridge is unique in NSW due to the intactness of its form compared to Menangle bridge, which has undergone significant alterations to its structural form through the addition of intermediate piers.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nVictoria bridge represents a type of bridge that was considered to be the cutting edge of technology when it was designed in 1862. Design principles used in Victoria Bridge were pioneered by Robert Stephenson in his design of the Britannia Bridge and The Conwy Bridge in Britain. In addition to this prestigious design history, Victoria Bridge has the largest spans of any metal girder bridge in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge is of state significance due to its role in bridging the Nepean River for the Great Western Railway. Victoria Bridge was a key element in bringing the railways to western NSW. The bridge's association with the designer of the Great Western Railway, John Whitton is also of significance.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nVictoria Bridge (Penrith) was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 27 May 2016 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state significance for its historical role as a vital element in the development of key road and rail transport routes across NSW from the 1860s and 1870s. In particular this includes the Great Western Railway line which opened up the western regions of the NSW, and made a significant contribution to improving trade flow across the state. As a road bridge it places a significant role in the story of crossing of the flood prone Nepean River, and was the first successful bridge crossing at Penrith. In addition to the wider advantages the bridge brought for transport across the state, it also has local significance for its economically on local workers and economies.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state significance for its association with its designer John Whitton, Engineer-in Chief for the NSW Railways, who also designed the Great Western Railway and the [[Zig Zag Railway]] at [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]] and [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]]. Mr Whitton was an outstanding engineer of his time and was also responsible for overseeing construction of the bridge and the railway line between Penrith and Wentworth Falls. It is also associated with the renowned British engineer John Fowler, of Firth of Forth Bridge Fame, who checked Whitton's design and plans and supervised the fabrication of the bridge in England.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state aesthetic significance because its design was based on important principles pioneered by Robert Stephenson on the Britannia Bridge and the Conwy Bridge in Wales. It is the most intact of only two iron through girder bridges built in NSW. Menangle Bridge now has intermediate piers and so no longer has its original form. Victoria Bridge is the only one of its type still operating with the same structural system that it was built with. The bridge has been an important landmark in Penrith since its construction.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge has state technical and aesthetic significance. Whitton's design employed the latest in British Bridge technology, utilising the through girder form, reinforced with boxes at the top and bottom of the girders, and long continuous spans to achieve maximum waterway, a feature of major importance at this site. The construction of the bridge constituted a major project carried out under extremely difficult circumstances. The bridge has strong and bold lines, providing a reassure presence in a landscape continually attacked by high floods which destroyed two previous bridges. It is a highly visually distinctive structure, and its enclosing form has always provided a distinctive travel experience, whether crossing by train, horse-drawn vehicle, motor vehicle or on foot. The Victoria Bridge and the visually complementary adjacent rail bridge form a landmark from both the Great Western highway and from the Nepean River and its banks. Both bridges are visually articulate about their structural properties and together, through their contrasting forms, provide an essay on the developments in metal bridge design across the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe quality and longevity of the bridge is evidence of Whitton's correct understanding of the power of the Nepean and his enormous commitment to build railways of a high standard, employing cutting edge British technology in a colony barely out of its infancy. The high level of the bridge and its robust stone piers, as well as s the iron span on the western end of the bridge added after its initial completion are articulate about the devastating potential of the river and the high level of persistence intelligence and investment required to bridge it.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nPublic esteem for the bridge and an enduring interest in its management and use over its lifetime has imbued Victoria Bridge with social significance at a State level. Its historic, technical and aesthetic qualities are widely recognised within the Penrith, [[Sydney]] and Blue Mountains communities and more widely among railway and bridge enthusiasts and historians. It forms a landmark in the Penrith area and has been the centrepiece of the tourist and sporting activities of the Nepean which have attracted boating parties, swimmers, rowers, spectators and picnickers from a wide catchment area.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\nThe bridge has local significance as a place of recreation. It is significant to the Heritage Engineers of Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge has research significance at a State level as one of the oldest metal bridges in Australia. Together with the [[Menangle Railway Bridge]] and [[Prince Alfred Bridge]] at [[Gundagai]], it is an important benchmark in early metal bridge design and construction practices giving insight into these activities which would be difficult to gain from other sources. With the largest spans of any metal girder bridge in NSW and being the most intact of two remaining bridges in the state of this type, the Victoria Bridge is of state significance for its research potential to illustrate the design and construction techniques of this type of bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nVictoria Bridge is of state significance as the only \"iron-through girder\" bridge that has not been significantly altered, making it unique in NSW. It was one of three iron box-girder bridges built in NSW and one of only two surviving bridges, the other being at Menangle. The third, being an 1869 single span over the [[Wollondilly River]] near [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], was demolished after duplication of the Great Southern Railway in 1914. The bridge also has State significance more generally as one of the oldest metal bridges in NSW and Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nIt is of state significance because it is representative of the cutting edge of bridge design in 1864 and is representative of early wrought iron heavy bridge design. It also represents the importance of high quality bridge design in the opening up of Western NSW to the railway.<ref name=nswshr-1950/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nPenrith Australia.jpg|The railway bridge, to the north of the Victoria Bridge, operational from 1907.\nVictoria Bridge - Nepean River - Penrith NSW (5554676422).jpg|Victoria Bridge - Nepean River - Penrith\nVictoriabridgepenrith1.jpg|Victoria Bridge - Nepean River - Penrith\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Transport|Engineering|New South Wales|Australian roads}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Sydney]]\n* [[List of places named after Queen Victoria]]\n* [[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=Article}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=Article |page=36}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=Penrith Valley Heritage Drive}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=National Trust Item Sheet}}\n* {{cite book|author=|date=|title=RTA Bridge File 5/358.123 t1}}\n* {{cite web|author=|date=|title=The Nepean Times 14 April 1882 & 1883, 26 Jan 1884, 19 Apr 1884, 28 June 1884, 20 December 1884|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cardno|first=M.

Esa Piironen Architects are working mostly with state and city municipalities but also with private companies and individuals. The firm has always practised environmentally responsible architecture. The practice has been characterised by a constant commitment to architecture based on a humanistic principle. One of the main works is Helsinki Railway Station Platform Roofing (2001) based on an international competition entry.\n\nIn 2007 Esa Piironen started cooperation with ALA Architects. Their main works are Otaniemi (Aalto University) metrostation and Keilaniemi metrostation, which were be completed in 2017.\n\nThe works of Esa Piironen Architects have been published in many distinguished architectural magazines around the world.\n\nEsa Piironen has lectured on various subjects related to urban design, architecture, environmental design, graphic design, exhibition design, environmental psychology in Finland and abroad. In 2012 he was appointed as a visiting professor at Guangdong University of Technology School of Art and Design.\n\n==Works==\n'''A selection of  works by Esa Piironen:'''<ref name=\"atl\">{{cite web |title=Toteutettuja suunnitelmia|url=http://www.atl.fi/index.php?id=186&tsto=182|editor=Cabinet Esa Piironen Oy|language=en}}</ref>\n\n*Private swimming hall, Turku, 1967, P+P (demolished)\n*Villa Suojaranta, Merimasku 1968\n*Rautavaara Church 1982 A+P\n*Hansasilta shopping mall and pedestrian bridge, Helsinki 1984 A+P\n*Botanical Garden and Glass House, Joensuu University 1985 A+P\n*Forest Research Center, Kannus 1985 A+P\n*Private House Koivikko 1985\n*Kurkim\u00e4ki Multipurpose Hall, Helsinki 1989 A+P\n*Office building Rautio, Espoo 1990 A+P\n*Tampere Hall 1990 A+P\n*Viikki Triangle Cemetery, Helsinki 1990 A+P\n*Kauhajoki School of Domestic Economics 1992\n*Sein\u00e4joki railway station, pedestrian tunnel and platform shelters 1993\n*Kaisaniemi metrostation (Helsinki University), platform hall, Helsinki 1995\n*Pikku-Huopalahti Multipurpose Hall, Helsinki 1997\n*Vuosaari metrostation 1998\n*Pori railway station, pedestrian tunnel and platform shelters 1998\n*Helsinki 2nd Training School, reparation and annex 1999\n*Korso railway station, Vantaa 2000\n*Helsinki railway station, platform roofing 2001\n*Pormestari pedestrian bridge, Pori 2001\n*N\u00f6ykki\u00f6laakso school reparation and annex, Espoo 2001\n*Lepp\u00e4vaara exchange terminal, Espoo 2002\n*Rautaruukki Polska Technology Center, Zyrardow 2002\n*Mikael Agricola Church, renovation, Helsinki 2004\n*Koivukyl\u00e4 railway station, Vantaa 2004\n*Hiekkaharju railway station, Vantaa 2004\n*Kallio Municipal Offices, renovation, Helsinki 2004\n*Mikkola School, Vantaa 2005\n*Haarajoki railway station, J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 2006\n*M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 railway station 2006\n*Ruukki Factory, Kiev, Ukraina 2007\n*Ruukki Factory Bolintin Deal, Romania 2008\n*Lepp\u00e4vaara Church, renovation, Espoo 2009\n*Kouvola railway station, platform shelters and lifts 2010\n*Tampere Hall renovation and annex 2017\n*Keilaniemi metrostation, Espoo 2017 ALA+ESA\n*Otaniemi metrostation (Aalto University), Espoo 2017 ALA+ESA\n\n==Architectural competitions==\n'''1st prizes:'''\n\n*Pyh\u00e4joki Church 1975\n*Kumpula University Area, Helsinki 1978 A+P\n*Rautavaara Church 1979 A+P\n*Tampere Hall 1983 A+P\n*Laajasalo Church, Helsinki A+P\n*Viikki Triangle Cemetery, Helsinki A+P\n*Luuniemi Housing Area, Iisalmi 1995\n*Helsinki Railway Station platform roofing 1995\n*Pori Railway station, platform shelters and pedestrian tunnel 1996\n*Pormestari pedestrian bridge, Pori 2000\n*Mestaritunneli, highway tunnel, Espoo 2005\n\n'''Other prizes, purchases and honorary mentions:'''\n\n*Lounaisrannikko Terraced Houses, Espoo, 3rd prize with others, 1968\n*Puoliv\u00e4linkangas Church, Oulu, competition entry, 2nd prize 1971\n*Tampere Library, competition entry, purchase, A+P, 1978\n*Kouvola Cultural Center, competition entry, 2nd prize A+P, 1979\n*Iisalmi Library- and Cultural Centre, competition entry, 3rd prize, A+P, 1980\n*Pori Music- and Congress Hall, competition entry, 3rd prize, A+P, 1981\n*Rauma Town Hall, competition entry, purchase, A+P, 1981\n*J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 Administrative and Cultural Centre, competition entry, purchase, A+P, 1981\n*The Official Residence of the President of Finland, Helsinki, 2nd prize A+P, 1983\n*Lamminp\u00e4\u00e4 cemetery and chapel, Tampere, invited competition, honorary mention.

The name ''Lynn'' is derived from the [[body of water]] near the town: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''llyn'', means a lake; but the name is plausibly of [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] origin, from ''lean'', implying a [[Tenure (law)|tenure]] in fee or farm.<ref name=\"regis\"/> As the [[Domesday Book]] mentions many saltings at Lena (Lynn), an area of partitioned pools or small lakes may have existed there at that time (1085). The salt may even have contributed to Herbert de Losinga's interest in the modest parish.\n\nFor a time it was named ''Len Episcopi'' (Bishop's Lynn) while under the jurisdiction, both temporal and spiritual, of the [[Bishop of Norwich]]; but during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] it was surrendered to the crown, and assumed the name of ''Lenne Regis'', or ''King's Lynn''.<ref name=\"regis\"/>\n\nIn the Domesday Book, it is recorded as ''Lun'', and ''Lenn''; and described as the property of the [[Bishop of Elmham]], and the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=\"regis\"/>\n\nThe town is and has been for generations generally known by its inhabitants and locals as ''Lynn''. The city of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], north of [[Boston]], was named in 1637 in honour of its first official minister of religion, Samuel Whiting, who arrived at the new settlement from Lynn, Norfolk.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ci.lynn.ma.us/aboutlynn_history.shtml |title=Brief History of Lynn |publisher=Ci.lynn.ma.us |date=30 May 1912 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829100613/http://www.ci.lynn.ma.us/aboutlynn_history.shtml |archive-date=29 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\nLynn originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south of where the [[River Great Ouse]] exits to the Wash. Development began in the early 10th century, but the place was not recorded until the early 11th century. Until the early 13th century, the Great Ouse emptied via the Wellstream at [[Wisbech]]. After the redirection of the Great Ouse in the 13th century, Lynn and its port became significant and prosperous.<ref>\"History of Lynn\" Volume 1 by William Richards M.A. 1812</ref>\n\nIn 1101, Bishop [[Herbert de Losinga]] of [[Thetford]] began to construct the first [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town between two rivers, the Purfleet to the north and Mill Fleet to the south.

It was considered as vital to England during the [[Middle Ages]] as [[Liverpool]] was during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Sea trade with Europe was dominated by the [[Hanseatic League]] of ports; the [[wikt:transatlantic|transatlantic]] trade and the rise of England's western ports did not begin until the 17th century. The [[King's Lynn Guildhall|Trinity Guildhall]] was rebuilt in 1421 after a fire.  Walls entered by the [[South Gate, King's Lynn|South Gate]] and East Gate were erected to protect the town.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poppyland.co.uk/index.php?s=KINGS_LYNN |title=King's Lynn |accessdate=8 June 2010 |work=Poppyland Publishing}}</ref> The town retains two former Hanseatic League warehouses: Hanse House built in 1475<ref name=hansehouse>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1195393 |desc=Hanse House |accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref> and Marriott's Warehouse,<ref name=marriotts>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1212000 |desc=Marriott's Warehouse |accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref> in use between the 15th and 17th centuries. They are the only remaining buildings from the Hanseatic League in England.\n\nIn the first decade of the 16th century, [[Thoresby College]] was built by Thomas Thoresby to house priests of the Guild of The Holy Trinity in Lynn. The guild had been incorporated in 1453 on the petition of its alderman, chaplain, four brethren and four sisters. The guildsmen were licensed to found a [[chantry]] of chaplains to celebrate at the altar of Holy Trinity in [[Wisbech]], and to grant to the chaplains lands in [[mortmain]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pugh |first=R.

In 1537 the king took control of the town from the bishop and in the 16th century the town's two annual fairs were reduced to one. In 1534 a [[grammar school]] was founded and four years later [[Henry VIII]] closed the Benedictine priory and the three friaries.\n\nDuring the 16th century a piped [[water supply]] was created, although many could not afford to be connected: [[elm]] pipes carried water under the streets. King's Lynn suffered from outbreaks of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], notably in 1516, 1587, 1597, 1636 and the last in 1665. Fire was another hazard and in 1572 thatched roofs were banned to reduce the risk. During the [[English Civil War]], King's Lynn supported Parliament, but in August 1643, after a change in government, the town changed sides. Parliament sent an army and the town was besieged for three weeks before it surrendered.\n\nA heart carved on the wall of the Tuesday Market Place commemorates the burning of an alleged witch, Margaret Read, in 1590.

Lynn was no longer a major international port, although iron and timber were imported. King's Lynn suffered from the discovery of the [[Americas]], which benefited ports on the west coast of England. Its trade was also affected by the growth of London.\n\nIn the late 17th century, imports of wine from Spain, Portugal and France boomed, and there was still an important coastal trade. It was cheaper to transport goods by water than by road at that time. Large quantities of coal arrived from the north-east of England.\n\n[[The Fens]] began to be drained in the mid\u201317th century, and the land turned to agriculture, allowing vast amounts of produce to be sent to the growing market in London. Meanwhile, King's Lynn was still an important fishing port. Greenland Fishery House in Bridge Street was built in 1605. By the late 17th century shipbuilding had become important. A glass-making industry also began at that time.\n\nIn the early 18th century, [[Daniel Defoe]] called the town \"beautiful, well built and well situated\". Shipbuilding thrived, as did associated industries such as sail-making and rope-making. Glass-making was prosperous and brewing was another important industry. The first bank in King's Lynn opened in 1784.\n\nA remarkable example of penal brutality occurred on 28 September 1708, when a seven-year-old boy, Michael Hammond, and his 11-year-old sister, Ann, were [[convicted]] of stealing a loaf of bread and sentenced to [[hanging]]. Their public executions took place near the [[South Gate, King's Lynn#South Gate|South Gate]]s. The Member of Parliament at the time was [[Robert Walpole|Sir Robert Walpole]], generally regarded as the first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=282 |title=18 December 1969, Death penalty abolished |date=1 April 2007 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Modern===\n[[File:cmglee_Kings_Lynn_railway_station.jpg|thumb|right|[[King's Lynn railway station]] in July 2017]]\nBy the late 17th century, the town's decline was reversed by the somewhat late arrival of railway services in 1847, provided mainly by the [[Great Eastern Railway]], subsequently the [[London and North Eastern Railway]], running to [[Hunstanton]], [[Dereham]] and [[Cambridge]]. The town was also served by the [[Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway]] (M&GN), which had offices at Austin Street, and a station at South Lynn (now dismantled). This was also its operational control centre until relocation to [[Melton Constable]]. The former M&GN lines across Norfolk were closed to passengers in February 1959.\n\nThe town's amenities continued to improve into the 20th century. A museum opened in 1904, and a public library in 1905. The first cinema, the [[Majestic Cinema, King's Lynn|Majestic]], was officially opened on 23 May 1928. (The year is commemorated in a stained glass window on the front of the building.) The town council began a programme of [[urban renewal|regeneration]] in the 1930s.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], King's Lynn was one of the first towns in Britain to suffer aerial bombing. On the night of 19 January 1915, the town was bombed by a naval [[Zeppelin]], L4 (LZ 27),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.ezep.de/2011/02/zeppelin-l4-lz-27-crashed-at-denmark-fuel-shortage/ |title=Zeppelin L4 (LZ-27) crashed at Denmark, fuel shortage &#124; eZEP-blog |publisher=Blog.ezep.de |date= |accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> commanded by Captain Lieutenant Magnus von Platen-Hallermund. Eleven bombs were dropped, both incendiary and high explosive, doing extensive damage, killing two people in Bentinck Street, and injuring several others. When World War II began, it was assumed that King's Lynn would be safe from bombing, and many evacuees were sent from London but the town was not completely safe and suffered several raids.\n\nIn 1962, King's Lynn was designated an overflow town for London and its population increased. New estates were built at the Woottons and [[Gaywood, Norfolk|Gaywood]]. The town centre was redeveloped in the 1960s and many old buildings destroyed. Lynnsport, a sports centre, opened in 1982. The corn exchange was converted into a theatre in 1996.\n\nThe local breweries had closed by the 1950s, but new industries included food canning in the 1930s and soup-making in the 1950s. In the 1960s, the council tried to encourage development by building an industrial estate at Hardwick. The new industries that arrived included light engineering, clothing and chemicals and fishing remained important.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Recent changes===\n[[File:Kings-lynn-river-great-ouse.JPG|thumb|right|King's Lynn, as viewed from across the [[River Great Ouse]]]]\n\nSince 2004, work has been under way to [[Urban renewal|regenerate]] the town through a multi-million-pound scheme. The Vancouver Shopping Centre (since renamed the Vancouver Quarter), built in the 1960s, was refurbished in 2005 as part of the scheme, but was expected to last for only 25 years, according to the construction firm, even with a planned extension.{{when|date=May 2019}} An award-winning \u00a36 million [[multi-storey car park]] was built.\n\nTo the south of town, residential housing was built on a large area of [[brownfield land]]. Ambitions to build another housing estate alongside the [[River Nar]] were opposed by local people and the economic situation brought them to a halt. There is also a business park, parkland, a school, shops and a new relief road in a \u00a3300 million+ scheme.\n\nIn 2006, King's Lynn became the United Kingdom's first member of The Hanse (''Die Hanse''), a network of towns and cities across Europe which historically belonged to the [[Hanseatic League]]. The league was a highly influential medieval [[Trade association|trading association]] of merchant towns around the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[North Sea]], which contributed to the development of King's Lynn.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=23286 |title=King's Lynn, a Hanse League Member |publisher=King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council Website |accessdate=15 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201703/http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=23286 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dow Chemical works - geograph.org.uk - 650287.jpg|thumb|[[Dow Chemical Company]] works in [[Kings Lynn]].]]\nThe Borough Council commissioned a report by DTZ  which was published in 2008 and accepted by the council.

It has appeared as a supporter in some representations, but officially stands on a [[bollard]] to make it distinctive. It supports a crown or [[coronet]] like a King's Lynn supporter and a lion from the crest of Downham Market.\n\nThe coronet refers to the Borough's royal connections.

The town centre is dominated by budget shops, reflecting the spending power of much of the population. The town centre fulfils a leisure role with entertainment centres, bars and restaurants, and has a range of service functions. There are around 5,300 retailing jobs.<ref name=\"vision\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/pdf/The%20Vision%20statement.pdf |title=The Vision for King's Lynn 2000-2023 |pages=2, 8 |date=April 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607102318/http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/pdf/The%20Vision%20statement.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=}}</ref>\n\nThe town centre has 73,000 sq.m. of retail floor space in 347 shops, which exceeds the comparable centres of [[Bury St Edmunds]] and [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]]. However, whilst the percentage of floor space in comparison shopping and that occupied by multiple retailers is above the national average, King's Lynn offers limited range of choice.<ref name=\"vision\"/>\n\n===Tourism===\n{{see also|Buildings in King's Lynn}}\nTourism in King's Lynn is a minor industry, but attracts visitors to its historic centre. It acts as a base for visiting the [[Sandringham House|Queen's home at Sandringham]] and other great country houses in the area. Within the town and across the nearby Fenland are some of the finest historic churches in Britain, built in a period when King's Lynn and its hinterland were very wealthy from trade and wool.\n\n==Transport==\n===Major routes===\nThe town is connected to the local cities of [[Norwich]] and [[Peterborough]] via the [[A47 road|A47]] and to Cambridge via the [[A10 road (Great Britain)|A10]]. It is also linked to Spalding and the North via the [[A17 road|A17]] and to other parts of Norfolk by the [[A148 road|A148]] and the [[A149 road|A149]]\n\n===South Transport Project===\n[[File:Lynn routes.png|thumb|350px|right|The developments taking place as part of the King's Lynn South Transport Project]]\n\nA \u00a37 million programme to redevelop the infrastructure of the town centre in the 2010s was largely provided by the [[Community Infrastructure Fund]].

It runs 720 metres long, running from Morston Drift to Millfleet, with buses travelling in both directions and features a separate path for pedestrians and bicycles, which coincides with the bus route when crossing the Nar sluice. As part of the development, the Millfleet\u2013St James' Road junction is being developed.<ref name=LynnCIF/>\n\nA contraflow lane for bicycles was proposed, but not built along Norfolk Street from Albert Street to Blackfriars Road. This would have included a development of the Norfolk Road\u2013Railway Road junction to better accommodate buses and bicycles. Similar work was to have taken place at the Norfolk Street\u2013Littleport Street junction, so that buses would not get caught in the town-centre gyratory system.<ref name=\"LynnCIF\"/>\n\n[[Bus priority]] measures have been added to four sets of traffic lights along St James' Road. This gives buses quicker access to the town centre and normalise journey times.<ref name=\"LynnCIF\"/>\n\nSouthgates Roundabout has been redeveloped. Many of its approach roads have been widened in the run up to the junction and the road markings redone{{clarify|date=May 2019}} in an attempt to improve lane discipline. Southgates Roundabout is a noted congestion hot spot.<ref name=\"LynnCIF\"/>\n\nOther small developments are taking place to make junctions more car-friendly.<ref name=\"LynnCIF\"/>\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:365504 at King's Lynn.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[British Rail Class 365|Class 365]] train at [[King's Lynn railway station]] in November 2009]]\n[[King's Lynn railway station]], the terminus of the [[Fen Line]], is the only rail facility in King's Lynn.

The Guild performed plays in the Guildhall, the first known production being a nativity play in January 1445. This makes it the UK's oldest working theatre.\n\nThe Guildhall was used for meetings, dinners and performance until in 1547, when King Edward VI dissolved the Guilds. It then became the property of Lynn Corporation and known as the Common Town Hall. Research by the University of East Anglia confirms as probable the oral history of Kings Lynn that William Shakespeare performed in the Guildhall in 1593. This is the only still-working theatre in the world that can credibly claim to have hosted Shakespeare. In 1766 Guildhall shows were so popular that a new interior was built inside the present structure, probably on the earlier footprint. By 1945 the Guildhall was almost derelict and in danger of demolition. It was bought by Alexander Penrose, who gave it to the National Trust in 1951. The Pilgrim Trust, Arts Council and public subscription led to the Guildhall\u2019s conversion into an Arts Centre. Queen Elizabeth (the Queen Mother) opened the venue in July 1951 and launched the King's Lynn Festival.\n\nToday the Guildhall is owned by the National Trust, leased by the Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk. Various groups are involved with the use of the building including Shakespeare's Guildhall Trust, King's Lynn Festival, King's Lynn Community Cinema Club\n\nThe Guildhall is managed by the Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk and is run as a venue for hire, supporting a year-round programme of theatre, dance, music, lectures and film. Shakespeare\u2019s Guildhall Trust have volunteers who open the theatre to visitors.\n<br />\n\n===Arts===\n[[Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy|Ruth, Lady Fermoy]], an accomplished concert pianist, moved to King's Lynn in 1931, as the bride of [[Maurice Roche, 4th Baron Fermoy|Lord Edmund Fermoy]], who was to become the town mayor and the local MP.

She was a close friend and [[lady-in-waiting]] to the Queen \u2013 later to become [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother]] \u2013 who agreed to become the festival's patron, and in July 1951 officially opened the restored St George's Guildhall.

The name ''Lynn'' is derived from the [[body of water]] near the town: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''llyn'', means a lake; but the name is plausibly of [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] origin, from ''lean'', implying a [[Tenure (law)|tenure]] in fee or farm.<ref name=\"regis\"/> As the [[Domesday Book]] mentions many saltings at Lena (Lynn), an area of partitioned pools or small lakes may have existed there at that time (1085). The salt may even have contributed to Herbert de Losinga's interest in the modest parish.\n\nFor a time it was named ''Len Episcopi'' (Bishop's Lynn) while under the jurisdiction, both temporal and spiritual, of the [[Bishop of Norwich]]; but during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] it was surrendered to the crown, and assumed the name of ''Lenne Regis'', or ''King's Lynn''.<ref name=\"regis\"/>\n\nIn the Domesday Book, it is recorded as ''Lun'', and ''Lenn''; and described as the property of the [[Bishop of Elmham]], and the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=\"regis\"/>\n\nThe town is and has been for generations generally known by its inhabitants and locals as ''Lynn''. The city of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], north of [[Boston]], was named in 1637 in honour of its first official minister of religion, Samuel Whiting, who arrived at the new settlement from Lynn, Norfolk.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ci.lynn.ma.us/aboutlynn_history.shtml |title=Brief History of Lynn |publisher=Ci.lynn.ma.us |date=30 May 1912 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829100613/http://www.ci.lynn.ma.us/aboutlynn_history.shtml |archive-date=29 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\nLynn originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south of where the [[River Great Ouse]] exits to the Wash. Development began in the early 10th century, but the place was not recorded until the early 11th century. Until the early 13th century, the Great Ouse emptied via the Wellstream at [[Wisbech]]. After the redirection of the Great Ouse in the 13th century, Lynn and its port became significant and prosperous.<ref>\"History of Lynn\" Volume 1 by William Richards M.A. 1812</ref>\n\nIn 1101, Bishop [[Herbert de Losinga]] of [[Thetford]] began to construct the first [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town between two rivers, the Purfleet to the north and Mill Fleet to the south.

It was considered as vital to England during the [[Middle Ages]] as [[Liverpool]] was during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Sea trade with Europe was dominated by the [[Hanseatic League]] of ports; the [[wikt:transatlantic|transatlantic]] trade and the rise of England's western ports did not begin until the 17th century. The [[King's Lynn Guildhall|Trinity Guildhall]] was rebuilt in 1421 after a fire.  Walls entered by the [[South Gate, King's Lynn|South Gate]] and East Gate were erected to protect the town.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poppyland.co.uk/index.php?s=KINGS_LYNN |title=King's Lynn |accessdate=8 June 2010 |work=Poppyland Publishing}}</ref> The town retains two former Hanseatic League warehouses: Hanse House built in 1475<ref name=hansehouse>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1195393 |desc=Hanse House |accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref> and Marriott's Warehouse,<ref name=marriotts>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1212000 |desc=Marriott's Warehouse |accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref> in use between the 15th and 17th centuries. They are the only remaining buildings from the Hanseatic League in England.\n\nIn the first decade of the 16th century, [[Thoresby College]] was built by Thomas Thoresby to house priests of the Guild of The Holy Trinity in Lynn. The guild had been incorporated in 1453 on the petition of its alderman, chaplain, four brethren and four sisters. The guildsmen were licensed to found a [[chantry]] of chaplains to celebrate at the altar of Holy Trinity in [[Wisbech]], and to grant to the chaplains lands in [[mortmain]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pugh |first=R.

In 1537 the king took control of the town from the bishop and in the 16th century the town's two annual fairs were reduced to one. In 1534 a [[grammar school]] was founded and four years later [[Henry VIII]] closed the Benedictine priory and the three friaries.\n\nDuring the 16th century a piped [[water supply]] was created, although many could not afford to be connected: [[elm]] pipes carried water under the streets. King's Lynn suffered from outbreaks of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], notably in 1516, 1587, 1597, 1636 and the last in 1665. Fire was another hazard and in 1572 thatched roofs were banned to reduce the risk. During the [[English Civil War]], King's Lynn supported Parliament, but in August 1643, after a change in government, the town changed sides. Parliament sent an army and the town was besieged for three weeks before it surrendered.\n\nA heart carved on the wall of the Tuesday Market Place commemorates the burning of an alleged witch, Margaret Read, in 1590.

Lynn was no longer a major international port, although iron and timber were imported. King's Lynn suffered from the discovery of the [[Americas]], which benefited ports on the west coast of England. Its trade was also affected by the growth of London.\n\nIn the late 17th century, imports of wine from Spain, Portugal and France boomed, and there was still an important coastal trade. It was cheaper to transport goods by water than by road at that time. Large quantities of coal arrived from the north-east of England.\n\n[[The Fens]] began to be drained in the mid\u201317th century, and the land turned to agriculture, allowing vast amounts of produce to be sent to the growing market in London. Meanwhile, King's Lynn was still an important fishing port. Greenland Fishery House in Bridge Street was built in 1605. By the late 17th century shipbuilding had become important. A glass-making industry also began at that time.\n\nIn the early 18th century, [[Daniel Defoe]] called the town \"beautiful, well built and well situated\". Shipbuilding thrived, as did associated industries such as sail-making and rope-making. Glass-making was prosperous and brewing was another important industry. The first bank in King's Lynn opened in 1784.\n\nA remarkable example of penal brutality occurred on 28 September 1708, when a seven-year-old boy, Michael Hammond, and his 11-year-old sister, Ann, were [[convicted]] of stealing a loaf of bread and sentenced to [[hanging]].

The town was also served by the [[Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway]] (M&GN), which had offices at Austin Street, and a station at South Lynn (now dismantled). This was also its operational control centre until relocation to [[Melton Constable]]. The former M&GN lines across Norfolk were closed to passengers in February 1959.\n\nThe town's amenities continued to improve into the 20th century. A museum opened in 1904, and a public library in 1905. The first cinema, the [[Majestic Cinema, King's Lynn|Majestic]], was officially opened on 23 May 1928. (The year is commemorated in a stained glass window on the front of the building.) The town council began a programme of [[urban renewal|regeneration]] in the 1930s.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], King's Lynn was one of the first towns in Britain to suffer aerial bombing. On the night of 19 January 1915, the town was bombed by a naval [[Zeppelin]], L4 (LZ 27),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.ezep.de/2011/02/zeppelin-l4-lz-27-crashed-at-denmark-fuel-shortage/ |title=Zeppelin L4 (LZ-27) crashed at Denmark, fuel shortage &#124; eZEP-blog |publisher=Blog.ezep.de |date= |accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> commanded by Captain Lieutenant Magnus von Platen-Hallermund. Eleven bombs were dropped, both incendiary and high explosive, doing extensive damage, killing two people in Bentinck Street, and injuring several others. When World War II began, it was assumed that King's Lynn would be safe from bombing, and many evacuees were sent from London but the town was not completely safe and suffered several raids.\n\nIn 1962, King's Lynn was designated an overflow town for London and its population increased. New estates were built at the Woottons and [[Gaywood, Norfolk|Gaywood]]. The town centre was redeveloped in the 1960s and many old buildings destroyed. Lynnsport, a sports centre, opened in 1982. The corn exchange was converted into a theatre in 1996.\n\nThe local breweries had closed by the 1950s, but new industries included food canning in the 1930s and soup-making in the 1950s. In the 1960s, the council tried to encourage development by building an industrial estate at Hardwick. The new industries that arrived included light engineering, clothing and chemicals and fishing remained important.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Recent changes===\n[[File:Kings-lynn-river-great-ouse.JPG|thumb|right|King's Lynn, as viewed from across the [[River Great Ouse]]]]\n\nSince 2004, work has been under way to [[Urban renewal|regenerate]] the town through a multi-million-pound scheme. The Vancouver Shopping Centre (since renamed the Vancouver Quarter), built in the 1960s, was refurbished in 2005 as part of the scheme, but was expected to last for only 25 years, according to the construction firm, even with a planned extension.{{when|date=May 2019}} An award-winning \u00a36 million [[multi-storey car park]] was built.\n\nTo the south of town, residential housing was built on a large area of [[brownfield land]]. Ambitions to build another housing estate alongside the [[River Nar]] were opposed by local people and the economic situation brought them to a halt. There is also a business park, parkland, a school, shops and a new relief road in a \u00a3300 million+ scheme.\n\nIn 2006, King's Lynn became the United Kingdom's first member of The Hanse (''Die Hanse''), a network of towns and cities across Europe which historically belonged to the [[Hanseatic League]]. The league was a highly influential medieval [[Trade association|trading association]] of merchant towns around the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[North Sea]], which contributed to the development of King's Lynn.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=23286 |title=King's Lynn, a Hanse League Member |publisher=King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council Website |accessdate=15 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201703/http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=23286 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dow Chemical works - geograph.org.uk - 650287.jpg|thumb|[[Dow Chemical Company]] works in [[Kings Lynn]].]]\nThe Borough Council commissioned a report by DTZ  which was published in 2008 and accepted by the council.

The town centre fulfils a leisure role with entertainment centres, bars and restaurants, and has a range of service functions. There are around 5,300 retailing jobs.<ref name=\"vision\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/pdf/The%20Vision%20statement.pdf |title=The Vision for King's Lynn 2000-2023 |pages=2, 8 |date=April 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607102318/http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/pdf/The%20Vision%20statement.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=}}</ref>\n\nThe town centre has 73,000 sq.m. of retail floor space in 347 shops, which exceeds the comparable centres of [[Bury St Edmunds]] and [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]]. However, whilst the percentage of floor space in comparison shopping and that occupied by multiple retailers is above the national average, King's Lynn offers limited range of choice.<ref name=\"vision\"/>\n\n===Tourism===\n{{see also|Buildings in King's Lynn}}\nTourism in King's Lynn is a minor industry, but attracts visitors to its historic centre. It acts as a base for visiting the [[Sandringham House|Queen's home at Sandringham]] and other great country houses in the area. Within the town and across the nearby Fenland are some of the finest historic churches in Britain, built in a period when King's Lynn and its hinterland were very wealthy from trade and wool.\n\n==Transport==\n===Major routes===\nThe town is connected to the local cities of [[Norwich]] and [[Peterborough]] via the [[A47 road|A47]] and to Cambridge via the [[A10 road (Great Britain)|A10]]. It is also linked to Spalding and the North via the [[A17 road|A17]] and to other parts of Norfolk by the [[A148 road|A148]] and the [[A149 road|A149]]\n\n===South Transport Project===\n[[File:Lynn routes.png|thumb|350px|right|The developments taking place as part of the King's Lynn South Transport Project]]\n\nA \u00a37 million programme to redevelop the infrastructure of the town centre in the 2010s was largely provided by the [[Community Infrastructure Fund]]. The department programme is a collection of smaller developments, which are detailed below.<ref name=\"LynnCIF\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.norfolk.gov.uk/consumption/groups/public/documents/article/ncc063857.pdf |title=King's Lynn South Transport Major Scheme |accessdate=17 November 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nWork on a cycle and bus route between the town centre and South Lynn began in June 2010 at a cost of \u00a3850,000. It runs 720 metres long, running from Morston Drift to Millfleet, with buses travelling in both directions and features a separate path for pedestrians and bicycles, which coincides with the bus route when crossing the Nar sluice. As part of the development, the Millfleet\u2013St James' Road junction is being developed.<ref name=LynnCIF/>\n\nA contraflow lane for bicycles was proposed, but not built along Norfolk Street from Albert Street to Blackfriars Road. This would have included a development of the Norfolk Road\u2013Railway Road junction to better accommodate buses and bicycles. Similar work was to have taken place at the Norfolk Street\u2013Littleport Street junction, so that buses would not get caught in the town-centre gyratory system.<ref name=\"LynnCIF\"/>\n\n[[Bus priority]] measures have been added to four sets of traffic lights along St James' Road. This gives buses quicker access to the town centre and normalise journey times.<ref name=\"LynnCIF\"/>\n\nSouthgates Roundabout has been redeveloped. Many of its approach roads have been widened in the run up to the junction and the road markings redone{{clarify|date=May 2019}} in an attempt to improve lane discipline. Southgates Roundabout is a noted congestion hot spot.<ref name=\"LynnCIF\"/>\n\nOther small developments are taking place to make junctions more car-friendly.<ref name=\"LynnCIF\"/>\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:365504 at King's Lynn.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[British Rail Class 365|Class 365]] train at [[King's Lynn railway station]] in November 2009]]\n[[King's Lynn railway station]], the terminus of the [[Fen Line]], is the only rail facility in King's Lynn.

The Guild performed plays in the Guildhall, the first known production being a nativity play in January 1445. This makes it the UK's oldest working theatre.\n\nThe Guildhall was used for meetings, dinners and performance until in 1547, when King Edward VI dissolved the Guilds. It then became the property of Lynn Corporation and known as the Common Town Hall. Research by the University of East Anglia confirms as probable the oral history of Kings Lynn that William Shakespeare performed in the Guildhall in 1593. This is the only still-working theatre in the world that can credibly claim to have hosted Shakespeare. In 1766 Guildhall shows were so popular that a new interior was built inside the present structure, probably on the earlier footprint. By 1945 the Guildhall was almost derelict and in danger of demolition. It was bought by Alexander Penrose, who gave it to the National Trust in 1951. The Pilgrim Trust, Arts Council and public subscription led to the Guildhall\u2019s conversion into an Arts Centre. Queen Elizabeth (the Queen Mother) opened the venue in July 1951 and launched the King's Lynn Festival.\n\nToday the Guildhall is owned by the National Trust, leased by the Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk. Various groups are involved with the use of the building including Shakespeare's Guildhall Trust, King's Lynn Festival, King's Lynn Community Cinema Club\n\nThe Guildhall is managed by the Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk and is run as a venue for hire, supporting a year-round programme of theatre, dance, music, lectures and film. Shakespeare\u2019s Guildhall Trust have volunteers who open the theatre to visitors.\n<br />\n\n===Arts===\n[[Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy|Ruth, Lady Fermoy]], an accomplished concert pianist, moved to King's Lynn in 1931, as the bride of [[Maurice Roche, 4th Baron Fermoy|Lord Edmund Fermoy]], who was to become the town mayor and the local MP.

She was a close friend and [[lady-in-waiting]] to the Queen \u2013 later to become [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother]] \u2013 who agreed to become the festival's patron, and in July 1951 officially opened the restored St George's Guildhall.

He is portrayed by [[Michael Mando]] and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n\nNacho is a quiet and intelligent member of the Salamanca drug organization. He cares deeply for the well-being of his honest, hard-working father, Manuel. He befriends [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] after Jimmy helps clear him of kidnapping charges. When the Salamancas seek to use his father's shop as a front for the drug ring, Nacho attempts to kill [[Hector Salamanca]], the family patriarch, by switching his medication, but this is discovered by [[Gus Fring]], who runs the rival drug trade. Nacho is forced to be a mole for Gus within the Salamancas, which is further complicated when the cartel sends the shrewd [[Lalo Salamanca]] to oversee operations.\n\n== Concept and development ==\n[[Michael Mando]] said that he had been approached through his agent from ''Better Call Saul''{{'s}} casting directors about being in the show. After sending in an audition tape, he was flown to Los Angeles to meet with showrunners [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and perform a screen test. For Mando, he said it was \"love at first sight\" in working with the pair in how well they provided direction and feedback, and was notified about getting the part a few weeks later.<ref name=\"abq mando\" /> To prepare for Nacho, Mando spent time watching crime and criminology documentaries to understand the motivations of criminals, as well as catching up on the whole of ''Breaking Bad'', which he had not yet watched in its entirety before. Mando considered Nacho to be \"extremely intelligent and patient\" and would be a character that would have growth over the course of the show.<ref name=\"abq mando\">{{Cite news |last=Gomez |first=Adrian |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/544900/better-call-saul-star-delves-into-role.html |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019s bad guy looks forward to season two |date=February 22, 2015 |work=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |access-date=March 9, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410180943/https://www.abqjournal.com/544900/better-call-saul-star-delves-into-role.html |archive-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref> Mando said that the showrunners gave little direction to the character, and instead \"They wanted to see what I would bring to the character\", allowing him to develop Nacho himself.<ref name=\"postmedia mando\" /> For part of that, he explored elements of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and [[Aztecs|Aztec]] cultures to bring to the character.

While he spends some of his time helping his father Manuel with his [[upholstery]] business, most of Nacho's time is assisting in the Salamanca family's drug ring, which he does not speak of to his father.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nWhile attempting to represent the Kettlemans, a family accused of embezzling $1.6 million, [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] has a run-in with [[Tuco Salamanca]]. Tuco  has Nacho and other associates drag Jimmy to the desert to kill him. Nacho believes Jimmy's plea that he is a lawyer and convinces Tuco that killing an attorney would result in police scrutiny of the Salamanca family's drug business, so Tuco lets Jimmy go. Nacho approaches Jimmy about stealing the money from the Kettlemans, but Jimmy refuses. He warns the Kettlemans, who disappear from their home.  Nacho is the prime suspect and is arrested. He coerces Jimmy into helping clear his name and Jimmy locates the Kettlemans, which leads to Nacho's release.\n\nNacho engages in a side deal with Daniel Wormald (\"Pryce\"), who wants to sell pills stolen from the pharmaceutical company where he works. Daniel brings [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] as a bodyguard. When Nacho's payment is $20 short, Mike insists he pay the full amount. As Daniel and Mike leave, Mike explains that he knew Nacho was conducting the transaction without the Salamancas' knowledge and so had an incentive to make sure the deal went smoothly.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nDaniel uses his drug money to buy a flashy [[Hummer]]. Mike refuses to participate in the next deal, so Daniel goes alone. Nacho takes the opportunity to learn Daniel's name and address. He later breaks into Daniel's house and steals the money back, along with a valuable collection of baseball cards. Daniel reports the collection's theft to the police, who discover an empty hiding place where Daniel hid the stolen drugs. Mike realizes his involvement will be uncovered if police continue to investigate, so he convinces Nacho to give Daniel the cards and $10,000 in exchange for the Hummer.\n\nNacho is impressed by Mike's candor and coolness under pressure.  As Tuco become increasingly volatile, potentially exposing the Salamanca organization, and the likelihood of his learning about Nacho's secret deals increases, Nacho decides to eliminate Tuco and tries to hire Mike to kill him.  Mike instead arranges a scenario where Tuco attacks him in view of police, leading to Tuco's arrest and conviction. [[Hector Salamanca]] has Nacho take Tuco's place in the organization. Mike becomes fearful that Hector may discover his role in removing Tuco from the family's operations.  He attempts to draw police attention to the Salamanca operation by hijacking one of the trucks used to smuggle drugs over the Mexican border, leaving the driver tied up at the side of the road and stealing the {{USD|250,000}} hidden in one of the tires. Nacho tells Mike that Hector covered up the hijacking by killing the Good Samaritan who stopped to aid the driver.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nMike's actions lead to Hector looking for other routes to smuggle drugs, and he considers using Manuel's upholstery shop. Nacho objects, but fails to change Hector's mind.  To protect his father, Nacho reveals his involvement in the Salamanca organization. Manuel accepts Hector's initial payment after Nacho convinces him doing so is for his own safety. Nacho realizes Hector suffers from angina and decides to try to kill him by replacing his nitroglycerin with an ibuprofen [[placebo]] in the hopes of inducing a fatal heart attack.  Mike advises Nacho that if Hector dies, Nacho should immediately take the placebos from Hector and replace them with the real medication so that the cause of Hector's death won't be obvious.\n\nNacho succeeds in making the switch, but Hector does not die, so Nacho plans to shoot him.  Before he can act, Nacho is notified to attend a meeting with [[Gus Fring]], Juan Bolsa, and Hector. Bolsa informs Hector that cartel leader Don Eladio has decreed that since Hector's trucks are no longer viable for smuggling drugs, the cartel will make the transport of Hector's drugs via Gus's trucks a permanent arrangement. An outraged Hector has a stroke and falls to the ground unconscious.  Gus performs first aid while awaiting an ambulance, and succeeds in saving Hector's life, though he remains comatose.  Nacho takes the placebos from Hector and replaces them with the real medication.  Gus seems to realize that something is amiss, but says nothing.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nBolsa tells Nacho that he and Arturo should run the Salamanca family while Hector is hospitalized.  Gus pays for Hector's specialized care to the point where his mental faculties are recovered and he can move the index finger of his right hand.  Gus reviews Hector's medical records and realizes there is no nitroglycerin in his system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him.  When Nacho and Arturo arrive at Gus' chicken farm to pick up their next cocaine shipment, Arturo takes six kilos instead of the agreed-upon five, as Nacho did on a previous occasion.  As they leave, Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo with a plastic bag.  Gus reveals that he is aware of Nacho's attempt to kill Hector, and that if Nacho does not follow Gus' orders, Gus will inform the Salamancas.  Nacho, Victor, and Tyrus fake an ambush site on a remote road, shooting bullet holes in Nacho's car, setting the car on fire, and shooting Nacho.\n\nNacho is treated by veterinarian Dr. Caldera, who succeeds in saving his life.  Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho to the Espinosas, a rival gang.  The Cousins arrive and Nacho falsely identifies the Espinosas as the ones who attacked him.  The Cousins attack the Espinosa compound, kill everyone inside, and recover the \"stolen\" drugs.  Nacho sees that by wiping out the Espinosas, Gus has secured more drug territory for himself, but does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan.  Nacho goes to his father's house to recover, and Manuel takes him in despite being unhappy about Nacho's ties to the Salamancas.  After recovering, Nacho takes on a more prominent role in the Salamanca organization, but also keeps a safe with cash and fake Canadian IDs for himself and his father.  Nacho is surprised when Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in running the business, and takes a stronger interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nUnder Gus' orders, Nacho replaces some of the Salamanca cocaine supply with inferior, locally produced methamphetamine.

He is portrayed by [[Michael Mando]] and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n\nNacho is a quiet and intelligent member of the Salamanca drug organization. He cares deeply for the well-being of his honest, hard-working father, Manuel. He befriends [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] after Jimmy helps clear him of kidnapping charges. When the Salamancas seek to use his father's shop as a front for the drug ring, Nacho attempts to kill [[Hector Salamanca]], the family patriarch, by switching his medication, but this is discovered by [[Gus Fring]], who runs the rival drug trade. Nacho is forced to be a mole for Gus within the Salamancas, which is further complicated when the cartel sends the shrewd [[Lalo Salamanca]] to oversee operations.\n\n== Concept and development ==\n[[Michael Mando]] said that he had been approached through his agent from ''Better Call Saul''{{'s}} casting directors about being in the show. After sending in an audition tape, he was flown to Los Angeles to meet with showrunners [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and perform a screen test. For Mando, he said it was \"love at first sight\" in working with the pair in how well they provided direction and feedback, and was notified about getting the part a few weeks later.<ref name=\"abq mando\" /> To prepare for Nacho, Mando spent time watching crime and criminology documentaries to understand the motivations of criminals, as well as catching up on the whole of ''Breaking Bad'', which he had not yet watched in its entirety before. Mando considered Nacho to be \"extremely intelligent and patient\" and would be a character that would have growth over the course of the show.<ref name=\"abq mando\">{{Cite news |last=Gomez |first=Adrian |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/544900/better-call-saul-star-delves-into-role.html |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019s bad guy looks forward to season two |date=February 22, 2015 |work=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |access-date=March 9, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410180943/https://www.abqjournal.com/544900/better-call-saul-star-delves-into-role.html |archive-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref> Mando said that the showrunners gave little direction to the character, and instead \"They wanted to see what I would bring to the character\", allowing him to develop Nacho himself.<ref name=\"postmedia mando\" /> For part of that, he explored elements of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and [[Aztecs|Aztec]] cultures to bring to the character.

While he spends some of his time helping his father Manuel with his [[upholstery]] business, most of Nacho's time is assisting in the Salamanca family's drug ring, which he does not speak of to his father.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nWhile attempting to represent the Kettlemans, a family accused of embezzling $1.6 million, [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] has a run-in with [[Tuco Salamanca]]. Tuco  has Nacho and other associates drag Jimmy to the desert to kill him. Nacho believes Jimmy's plea that he is a lawyer and convinces Tuco that killing an attorney would result in police scrutiny of the Salamanca family's drug business, so Tuco lets Jimmy go. Nacho approaches Jimmy about stealing the money from the Kettlemans, but Jimmy refuses. He warns the Kettlemans, who disappear from their home.  Nacho is the prime suspect and is arrested. He coerces Jimmy into helping clear his name and Jimmy locates the Kettlemans, which leads to Nacho's release.\n\nNacho engages in a side deal with Daniel Wormald (\"Pryce\"), who wants to sell pills stolen from the pharmaceutical company where he works. Daniel brings [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] as a bodyguard. When Nacho's payment is $20 short, Mike insists he pay the full amount. As Daniel and Mike leave, Mike explains that he knew Nacho was conducting the transaction without the Salamancas' knowledge and so had an incentive to make sure the deal went smoothly.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nDaniel uses his drug money to buy a flashy [[Hummer]]. Mike refuses to participate in the next deal, so Daniel goes alone. Nacho takes the opportunity to learn Daniel's name and address. He later breaks into Daniel's house and steals the money back, along with a valuable collection of baseball cards. Daniel reports the collection's theft to the police, who discover an empty hiding place where Daniel hid the stolen drugs. Mike realizes his involvement will be uncovered if police continue to investigate, so he convinces Nacho to give Daniel the cards and $10,000 in exchange for the Hummer.\n\nNacho is impressed by Mike's candor and coolness under pressure.  As Tuco become increasingly volatile, potentially exposing the Salamanca organization, and the likelihood of his learning about Nacho's secret deals increases, Nacho decides to eliminate Tuco and tries to hire Mike to kill him.  Mike instead arranges a scenario where Tuco attacks him in view of police, leading to Tuco's arrest and conviction. [[Hector Salamanca]] has Nacho take Tuco's place in the organization. Mike becomes fearful that Hector may discover his role in removing Tuco from the family's operations.  He attempts to draw police attention to the Salamanca operation by hijacking one of the trucks used to smuggle drugs over the Mexican border, leaving the driver tied up at the side of the road and stealing the {{USD|250,000}} hidden in one of the tires. Nacho tells Mike that Hector covered up the hijacking by killing the Good Samaritan who stopped to aid the driver.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nMike's actions lead to Hector looking for other routes to smuggle drugs, and he considers using Manuel's upholstery shop. Nacho objects, but fails to change Hector's mind.  To protect his father, Nacho reveals his involvement in the Salamanca organization. Manuel accepts Hector's initial payment after Nacho convinces him doing so is for his own safety. Nacho realizes Hector suffers from angina and decides to try to kill him by replacing his nitroglycerin with an ibuprofen [[placebo]] in the hopes of inducing a fatal heart attack.  Mike advises Nacho that if Hector dies, Nacho should immediately take the placebos from Hector and replace them with the real medication so that the cause of Hector's death won't be obvious.\n\nNacho succeeds in making the switch, but Hector does not die, so Nacho plans to shoot him.  Before he can act, Nacho is notified to attend a meeting with [[Gus Fring]], Juan Bolsa, and Hector. Bolsa informs Hector that cartel leader Don Eladio has decreed that since Hector's trucks are no longer viable for smuggling drugs, the cartel will make the transport of Hector's drugs via Gus's trucks a permanent arrangement. An outraged Hector has a stroke and falls to the ground unconscious.  Gus performs first aid while awaiting an ambulance, and succeeds in saving Hector's life, though he remains comatose.  Nacho takes the placebos from Hector and replaces them with the real medication.  Gus seems to realize that something is amiss, but says nothing.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nBolsa tells Nacho that he and Arturo should run the Salamanca family while Hector is hospitalized.  Gus pays for Hector's specialized care to the point where his mental faculties are recovered and he can move the index finger of his right hand.  Gus reviews Hector's medical records and realizes there is no nitroglycerin in his system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him.  When Nacho and Arturo arrive at Gus' chicken farm to pick up their next cocaine shipment, Arturo takes six kilos instead of the agreed-upon five, as Nacho did on a previous occasion.  As they leave, Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo with a plastic bag.  Gus reveals that he is aware of Nacho's attempt to kill Hector, and that if Nacho does not follow Gus' orders, Gus will inform the Salamancas.  Nacho, Victor, and Tyrus fake an ambush site on a remote road, shooting bullet holes in Nacho's car, setting the car on fire, and shooting Nacho.\n\nNacho is treated by veterinarian Dr. Caldera, who succeeds in saving his life.  Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho to the Espinosas, a rival gang.  The Cousins arrive and Nacho falsely identifies the Espinosas as the ones who attacked him.  The Cousins attack the Espinosa compound, kill everyone inside, and recover the \"stolen\" drugs.  Nacho sees that by wiping out the Espinosas, Gus has secured more drug territory for himself, but does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan.  Nacho goes to his father's house to recover, and Manuel takes him in despite being unhappy about Nacho's ties to the Salamancas.  After recovering, Nacho takes on a more prominent role in the Salamanca organization, but also keeps a safe with cash and fake Canadian IDs for himself and his father.  Nacho is surprised when Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in running the business, and takes a stronger interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nUnder Gus' orders, Nacho replaces some of the Salamanca cocaine supply with inferior, locally produced methamphetamine.  Buyer complaints lead Lalo to meet with Gus and Juan Bolsa.  Gus presents a cover story about Werner Ziegler, of whose activities Lalo was partly aware.{{efn|from \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\"}}  Gus claims Werner was working on a legitimate construction project at the chicken farm and stole cocaine, which Gus then replaced with meth.
