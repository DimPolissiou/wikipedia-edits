limit}}\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Deaf videoconference.jpg|thumb|A deaf person using a camera-equipped smartphone to communicate in sign language.]]\n*Hearing loss exists when there is diminished acuity to sounds normally heard.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> The terms hearing impaired or hard of hearing are usually reserved for people who have relative inability to hear sound in the speech frequencies. The severity of a hearing loss is categorized according to the increase in intensity of sound above the usual level necessary before the listener can detect it.\n*Deafness is defined as a degree of loss such that a person is unable to understand speech even in the presence of amplification.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> In profound deafness, even the highest intensity sounds produced by an [[audiometer]] (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, are heard.\n*[[Speech perception]] \u2013 Another aspect of hearing involves the perceived clarity of a word rather than the intensity of sound made by the word. In humans, that aspect is usually measured by tests of speech discrimination. These tests measure one's ability to understand speech, not to merely detect sound. There are very rare types of hearing loss which affect speech discrimination alone.  One example is [[auditory neuropathy]], a variety of hearing loss in which the outer hair cells of the cochlea are intact and functioning, but sound information is not faithfully transmitted to the auditory nerve and brain properly.<ref name=\"eBook1\">eBook: ''Current Diagnosis & Treatment in Otolaryngology: Head & Neck Surgery'', Lalwani, Anil K.

Sound is generally uncomfortably loud above 90&nbsp;dB and 115&nbsp;dB represents the [[threshold of pain]]. The ear does not hear all frequencies equally well; hearing sensitivity peaks around 3000&nbsp;Hz.  There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and intensity that cannot easily be measured quantitatively. But for many practical purposes, normal hearing is defined by a frequency versus intensity graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies.  Because of the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other acoustic insults, 'typical' hearing may not be normal.<ref>ANSI 7029:2000/BS 6951 Acoustics - Statistical distribution of hearing thresholds as a function of age</ref><ref>ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech Intelligibility Index (SII)</ref>\nif jacebolt210 goes moaning then u get deaf too\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n*difficulty using the [[telephone]]\n*loss of [[Sound localization|directionality of sound]]\n*difficulty [[Speech perception|understanding speech]], especially of children and women whose voices are of a [[Voice frequency#Fundamental frequency|higher frequency]].\n*difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise ([[cocktail party effect]])\n*sounds or speech becoming dull, muffled or attenuated\n*need for increased volume on television, radio, music and other audio sources\n\nHearing loss is sensory, but may have accompanying symptoms:\n*pain or pressure in the ears\n*a blocked feeling\n\nThere may also be accompanying secondary symptoms:\n*[[hyperacusis]], heightened sensitivity with accompanying auditory pain to certain intensities and frequencies of sound, sometimes defined as \"[[auditory recruitment]]\"\n*[[tinnitus]], ringing, buzzing, hissing or other sounds in the ear when no external sound is present\n*[[vertigo]] and disequilibrium\n*[[Autophony|tympanophonia]], also known as autophonia, abnormal hearing of one's own voice and respiratory sounds, usually as a result of a patulous (a constantly open) eustachian tube or dehiscent superior semicircular canals\n*disturbances of facial movement (indicating a possible tumour or stroke) or in persons with [[Bell's palsy|Bell's Palsy]]\n\n=== Complications ===\nHearing loss is associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[dementia]].

As ageing and other effects contribute to higher frequency loss (6\u20138&nbsp;kHz on an audiogram), this notch may be obscured and entirely disappear.\n\nVarious governmental, industry and standards organizations set noise standards.<ref>In the United States, [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]], and numerous state government agencies among others, set noise standards.</ref>\n\nThe [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has identified the level of 70&nbsp;dB(A) (40% louder to twice as loud as normal conversation; typical level of TV, radio, stereo; city street noise) for 24\u2011hour exposure as the level necessary to protect the public from hearing loss and other disruptive effects from noise, such as sleep disturbance, stress-related problems, learning detriment, etc.<ref>Information on Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety.

Estimation of a \"safe\" duration of exposure is possible using an ''exchange rate'' of 3&nbsp;dB. As 3&nbsp;dB represents a doubling of the intensity of sound, duration of exposure must be cut in half to maintain the same energy dose. For workplace noise regulation, the \"safe\" daily exposure amount at 85&nbsp;dB A, known as an [[exposure action value]], is 8 hours, while the \"safe\" exposure at 91&nbsp;dB(A) is only 2 hours.<ref>Occupational Noise Exposure, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 98-126</ref>\nDifferent standards use exposure action values between 80dBA and 90dBA. Note that for some people, sound may be damaging at even lower levels than 85&nbsp;dB A. Exposures to other ototoxins (such as pesticides, some medications including chemotherapy agents, solvents, etc.) can lead to greater susceptibility to noise damage, as well as causing its own damage. This is called a ''synergistic'' interaction.  Since noise damage is cumulative over long periods of time, persons who are exposed to non-workplace noise, like recreational activities or environmental noise, may have compounding damage from all sources.\n\nSome national and international organizations and agencies use an exchange rate of 4&nbsp;dB or 5&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| title=Compliance Guide to MSHA's Occupational Noise Exposure Standard, APPENDIX B \u2013 GLOSSARY OF TERMS| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112204458/http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| archive-date=2013-11-12| access-date=2013-11-12}}</ref> While these exchange rates may indicate a wider zone of comfort or safety, they can significantly underestimate the damage caused by loud noise. For example, at 100&nbsp;dB (nightclub music level), a 3&nbsp;dB exchange rate would limit exposure to 15 minutes; the 5&nbsp;dB exchange rate allows an hour.\n\nMany people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. If one is exposed to loud sound (including music) at high levels or for extended durations (85&nbsp;dB A or greater), then hearing loss will occur. Sound intensity (sound energy, or propensity to cause damage to the ears) increases dramatically with proximity according to an inverse square law: halving the distance to the sound quadruples the sound intensity.\n\nIn the US, 12.5% of children aged 6\u201319 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure.<ref name=\"kid\">{{cite web| url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss: Promoting Hearing Health Among Youth| work=CDC Healthy Youth!| publisher=CDC| date=2009-07-01| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221020243/http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| archive-date=2009-12-21}}</ref>  The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using [[personal audio devices]] that are too loud.<ref name=WHO2015Aud/>\n\nHearing loss due to noise has been described as primarily a condition of modern society.<ref name=Go2007>{{cite journal| last1=Goines| first1=Lisa| last2=Hagler| first2=Louis| name-list-format = vanc | title=Noise Pollution: A Modern Plague| journal=Southern Medical Journal| date=March 2007| volume=100| issue=3| pages=287\u2013294 | citeseerx=10.1.1.504.8717| doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e3180318be5| pmid=17396733}}</ref> In preindustrial times, humans had far less exposure to loud sounds.

Diagnosis of the cause of a hearing loss is carried out by a specialist physician (audiovestibular physician) or [[otorhinolaryngologist]].\n\n===Case history===\nA case history (usually a written form, with questionnaire) can provide valuable information about the context of the hearing loss, and indicate what kind of diagnostic procedures to employ.

As the name implies, a speech-in-noise test gives an indication of how well one can understand speech in a noisy environment. A person with a hearing loss will often be less able to understand speech, especially in noisy conditions. This is especially true for people who have a sensorineural loss \u2013 which is by far the most common type of hearing loss. As such, speech-in-noise tests can provide valuable information about a person's hearing ability, and can be used to detect the presence of a sensorineural hearing loss. A recently developed digit-triple speech-in-noise test may be a more efficient screening test.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jansen S, Luts H, Dejonckere P, van Wieringen A, Wouters J | title = Efficient hearing screening in noise-exposed listeners using the digit triplet test | journal = Ear and Hearing | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 773\u20138 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23782715 | doi = 10.1097/AUD.0b013e318297920b | url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/398543/2/Jansen_Ear%26Hearing_2013.pdf }}</ref>\n\nOtoacoustic emissions test is an objective hearing test that may be administered to toddlers and children too young to cooperate in a conventional hearing test. The test is also useful in older children and adults and is an important measure in diagnosing auditory neuropathy described above.\n\nAuditory brainstem response testing is an electrophysiological test used to test for hearing deficits caused by pathology within the ear, the cochlear nerve and also within the brainstem. This test can be used to identify delay in the conduction of neural impulses due to tumours or inflammation but can also be an objective test of hearing thresholds. Other electrophysiological tests, such as cortical evoked responses, can look at the hearing pathway up to the level of the auditory cortex.\n\n===Scans===\n{{contradictory|date=August 2019}}\nMRI and CT scans can be useful to identify the pathology of many causes of hearing loss. They are only needed in selected cases.{{vague|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Classification===\nHearing loss is categorized by type, severity, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral).  Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive.\n\n====Severity====\nThe severity of a hearing loss is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds in which a sound must be so it can be detected by an individual. It is measured in [[decibel]]s of hearing loss, or dB HL. The measurement of hearing loss in an individual is conducted over several [[frequency|frequencies]], mostly 500&nbsp;Hz, 1000&nbsp;Hz, 2000&nbsp;Hz and 4000&nbsp;Hz. The hearing loss of the individual is the average of the hearing loss values over the different frequencies. Hearing loss can be ranked differently according to different organisations; and so, in different countries different systems are in use.\n\nHearing loss may be ranked as slight, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound as defined below:{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n* Slight: between 16 and 25&nbsp;dB HL\n* Mild:\n** for adults: between 26 and 40&nbsp;dB HL\n** for children: between 20 and 40&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Moderate: between 41 and 54&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Moderately severe: between 55 and 70&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Severe: between 71 and 90&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Profound: 91&nbsp;dB HL or greater<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Totally deaf: Have no hearing at all.  This is called ''anacusis''.\n\nThe 'Audiometric Classifications of Hearing Impairment' according to the International Bureau Audiophonology (BIAP) in Belgium is as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=BIAP Recommendation 02/1 bis - AUDIOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF HEARING IMPAIRMENTS|url=https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|website=biap.org|publisher=International Bureau Audiophonology|access-date=18 June 2017|date=26 October 1996|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908010426/https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref>\n* Normal or subnormal hearing: average tone loss is equal or below 20&nbsp;dB HL\n* Mild hearing loss: average tone loss between 21 and 40&nbsp;dB HL\n* Moderate hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 41 and 55&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 56 and 70&nbsp;dB HL\n* Severe hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 71 and 80&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 81 and 90&nbsp;dB HL\n* Very severe hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 91 and 100&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 101 and 110&nbsp;dB HL\n** Third degree: average tone loss between 111 and 119&nbsp;dB HL\n* Total hearing loss or Cophosis: average tone loss is equal or more than 120&nbsp;dB HL\n\nHearing loss may affect one or both ears. If both ears are affected, then one ear may be more affected than the other.  Thus it is possible, for example, to have normal hearing in one ear and none at all in the other, or to have mild hearing loss in one ear and moderate hearing loss in the other.\n\nFor certain legal purposes such as insurance claims, hearing loss is described in terms of percentages. Given that hearing loss can vary by frequency and that audiograms are plotted with a logarithmic scale, the idea of a percentage of hearing loss is somewhat arbitrary, but where decibels of loss are converted via a legally recognized formula, it is possible to calculate a standardized \"percentage of hearing loss\", which is suitable for legal purposes only.\n\n====Type====\nThere are three main types of hearing loss, [[conductive hearing loss]], [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. Combinations of conductive and sensorineural hearing losses are called a mixed hearing loss.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is [[auditory processing disorder]] which is not a hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound.\n\n*Conductive hearing loss\nConductive hearing loss is present when the sound is not reaching the inner ear, the [[cochlea]]. This can be due to external ear canal malformation, dysfunction of the eardrum or malfunction of the bones of the middle ear. The eardrum may show defects from small to total resulting in hearing loss of different degree. [[Granulation tissue|Scar tissue]] after ear infections may also make the eardrum dysfunction as well as when it is retracted and adherent to the medial part of the middle ear.\n\nDysfunction of the three small bones of the [[middle ear]] \u2013 malleus, incus, and stapes \u2013 may cause conductive hearing loss. The mobility of the [[ossicles]] may be impaired for different reasons including a boney disorder of the ossicles called [[otosclerosis]] and disruption of the ossicular chain due to trauma, infection or [[ankylosis]] may also cause hearing loss.\n\n*Sensorineural hearing loss\nSensorineural hearing loss is one caused by dysfunction of the inner ear, the cochlea or the nerve that transmits the impulses from the cochlea to the hearing centre in the brain. The most common reason for sensorineural hearing loss is damage to the [[hair cells]] in the cochlea. Depending on the definition it could be estimated that more than 50% of the population over the age of 70 has impaired hearing.<ref name=\"RussellPineYoung2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell JL, Pine HS, Young DL | title = Pediatric cochlear implantation: expanding applications and outcomes | journal = Pediatric Clinics of North America | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 841\u201363 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23905823 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2013.04.008 }}</ref>\n\n*Central deafness\nDamage to the brain can lead to a central deafness. The peripheral ear and the auditory nerve may function well but the central connections are damaged by tumour, trauma or other disease and the patient is unable to process speech information.\n\n*Mixed hearing loss\nMixed hearing loss is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Chronic ear infection (a fairly common diagnosis) can cause a defective [[ear drum]] or middle-ear ossicle damages, or both.  In addition to the conductive loss, a sensory component may be present.\n\n*Central [[auditory processing disorder]]\n\nThis is not an actual hearing loss but gives rise to significant difficulties in hearing. One kind of auditory processing disorder is [[King-Kopetzky syndrome]], which is characterized by an inability to process out background noise in noisy environments despite normal performance on traditional hearing tests. An [[auditory processing disorder]]s is sometimes linked to language disorders in persons of all ages.\n\n====Configuration====\nThe shape of an audiogram shows the relative configuration of the hearing loss, such as a [[Carhart notch]] for otosclerosis, 'noise' notch for noise-induced damage, high frequency rolloff for presbycusis, or a flat audiogram for conductive hearing loss. In conjunction with speech audiometry, it may indicate central auditory processing disorder, or the presence of a [[schwannoma]] or other tumor.\nThere are four general configurations of hearing loss:\n\n1. Flat: thresholds essentially equal across test frequencies.\n\n2. Sloping: lower (better) thresholds in low-frequency regions and higher (poorer) thresholds in high-frequency regions.\n\n3. Rising: higher (poorer) thresholds in low-frequency regions and lower (better) thresholds in higher-frequency regions.\n\n4. Trough-shaped (\"cookie-bite\" or \"U\" shaped): greatest hearing loss in the mid-frequency range, with lower (better) thresholds in low- and high-frequency regions.\n\n====Unilateral and bilateral====\nPeople with [[unilateral hearing loss]] or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in:\n\n*hearing conversation on their impaired side\n*localizing sound\n*understanding speech in the presence of background noise.\n\nIn quiet conditions, speech discrimination is approximately the same for normal hearing and those with unilateral deafness; however, in noisy environments speech discrimination varies individually and ranges from mild to severe.\n\nOne reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the [[head shadow effect]]. Newborn children with no hearing on one side but one normal ear could still have problems.<ref name=\"pmid15148171\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lieu JE | title = Speech-language and educational consequences of unilateral hearing loss in children | journal = Archives of Otolaryngology\u2013Head & Neck Surgery | volume = 130 | issue = 5 | pages = 524\u201330 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15148171 | doi = 10.1001/archotol.130.5.524 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Speech development could be delayed and difficulties to concentrate in school are common.

For the most part, there is little objection to those who lost their hearing later in life, or culturally deaf adults choosing to be fitted with a cochlear implant.<ref name=Spa2005/>\n\nMany in the deaf community strongly object to a deaf child being fitted with a cochlear implant (often on the advice of an audiologist); new parents may not have sufficient information on raising deaf children and placed in an oral-only program that emphasizes the ability to speak and listen over other forms of communication such as [[sign language]] or [[total communication]]. Many deaf people view cochlear implants and other hearing devices as confusing to one's identity. They feel a deaf person will never be a hearing person and therefore would be trying to fit into a way of living that is not their own. Other concerns include loss of [[deaf culture]] and identity and limitations on hearing restoration.<ref name=Spa2005/>\n\nJack Gannon, a professor at [[Gallaudet University]], said this about [[Deaf culture]]: \"Deaf culture is a set of learned behaviors and perceptions that shape the values and norms of deaf people based on their shared or common experiences.\" Some doctors believe that being deaf makes a person more social. Bill Vicar, from ASL University, shared his experiences as a deaf person, \"[deaf people] tend to congregate around the kitchen table rather than the living room sofa... our good-byes take nearly forever, and our hellos often consist of serious hugs. When two of us meet for the first time we tend to exchange detailed biographies.\"<ref>Deaf Heritage: A Narrative History of Deaf America by Jack Gannon (National Association of the Deaf, 1981)</ref> Deaf culture is not about contemplating what deaf people cannot do and how to fix their problems, an approach known as the \"pathological view of the deaf.\"<ref name=pathological>{{cite web|title=American Deaf Culture|url=http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|work=Sign Media, Incorporated|publisher=Sign Media, Inc|access-date=14 May 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522030209/http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|archive-date=22 May 2013}}</ref> Instead deaf people celebrate what they can do. There is a strong sense of unity between deaf people as they share their experiences of suffering through a similar struggle. This celebration creates a unity between even deaf strangers.

Much of the negative reaction to cochlear implants stems from the medical viewpoint that deafness is a condition that needs to be \"cured,\" while the Deaf community instead regards deafness a defining cultural characteristic.\n\nMany other assistive devices are more acceptable to the Deaf community, including but not limited to, hearing aids, [[closed captioning]], email and the Internet, text telephones, and video relay services.\n\n==Sign language==\n{{Main|Sign language}}\n[[File:Drawing (sign language friend), 2008.jpg|thumb|The sign language for \"friend\".]]\nSign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns.

An argument supporting inclusion, on the other hand, exposes the student to people who are not just like them, preparing them for adult life. Through interacting, children with hearing disabilities can expose themselves to other cultures which in the future may be beneficial for them when it comes to finding jobs and living on their own in a society where their disability may put them in the minority. These are some reasons why a person may or may not want to put their child in an inclusion classroom.<ref name=\"SmithDD2010\" />\n\n====Family====\nThe communication limitations between people who are deaf and their hearing family members can often cause difficulties in family relationships, and affect the strength of relationships among individual family members. It was found that most people who are deaf have hearing parents, which means that the channel that the child and parents communicate through can be very different, often affecting their relationship in a negative way. If a parent communicates best verbally, and their child communicates best using sign language, this could result in ineffective communication between parents and children. Ineffective communication can potentially lead to fights caused by misunderstanding, less willingness to talk about life events and issues, and an overall weaker relationship. Even if individuals in the family made an effort to learn deaf communication techniques such as sign language, a deaf family member often will feel excluded from casual banter; such as the exchange of daily events and news at the dinner table. It is often difficult for people who are deaf to follow these conversations due to the fast-paced and overlapping nature of these exchanges. This can cause a deaf individual to become frustrated and take part in less family conversations. This can potentially result in weaker relationships between the hearing individual and their immediate family members. This communication barrier can have a particularly negative effect on relationships with extended family members as well. Communication between a deaf individual and their extended family members can be very difficult due to the gap in verbal and non-verbal communication. This can cause the individuals to feel frustrated and unwilling to put effort into communicating effectively. The lack of effort put into communicating can result in anger, miscommunication, and unwillingness to build a strong relationship.<ref name=\"FOSTER\">{{cite book | vauthors = Foster S | date = 1996 | chapter = Communication experiences of deaf people: An ethnographic account. | veditors = Parasnis I | title = Cultural and language diversity of the deaf experience | pages = 117\u2013136 | location = New York | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}</ref>\n\n====Community====\n[[File:Alexander Graham Bell and his Scott Circle School.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Graham Bell]] with teachers and students of the Scott Circle School for deaf children, Washington, D.C., 1883]]\nPeople who have hearing loss can often experience many difficulties as a result of communication barriers among them and other hearing individuals in the community. Some major areas that can be impacted by this are involvement in extracurricular activities and social relationships. For young people, extracurricular activities are vehicles for physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development. However, it is often the case that communication barriers between people who are deaf and their hearing peers and coaches/club advisors limit them from getting involved. These communication barriers make it difficult for someone with a hearing loss to understand directions, take advice, collaborate, and form bonding relationships with other team or club members. As a result, extracurricular activities such as sports teams, clubs, and volunteering are often not as enjoyable and beneficial for individuals who have hearing loss, and they may engage in them less often. A lack of community involvement through extracurricular activities may also limit the individual's social network. In general, it can be difficult for someone who is deaf to develop and maintain friendships with their hearing peers due to the communication gap that they experience. They can often miss the jokes, informal banter, and \"messing around\" that is associated with the formation of many friendships among young people. Conversations between people who are deaf and their hearing peers can often be limited and short due to their differences in communication methods and lack of knowledge on how to overcome these differences. Deaf individuals can often experience rejection by hearing peers who are not willing to make an effort to find their way around communication difficulties. Patience and motivation to overcome such communication barriers is required by both the deaf or hard of hearing and hearing individuals in order to establish and maintain good friendships.<ref name=\"FOSTER\" />\n\nMany people tend to forget about the difficulties that deaf children encounter, as they view the deaf child differently from a deaf adult. Deaf children grow up being unable to fully communicate with their parents, siblings and other family members. Examples include being unable to tell their family what they have learned, what they did, asking for help, or even simply being unable to interact in daily conversation. Deaf children have to learn sign language and to read lips at a young age, however they cannot communicate with others using it unless the others are educated in sign language as well. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing are faced with many complications while growing up, for example some children have to wear hearing aids and others require assistance from sign language (ASL) interpreters. The interpreters help them to communicate with other individuals until they develop the skills they need to efficiently communicate on their own. Although growing up for deaf children may entitle more difficulties than for other children, there are many support groups that allow deaf children to interact with other children. This is where they develop friendships. There are also classes for young children to learn sign language in an environment that has other children in their same situation and around their same age. These groups and classes can be very beneficial in providing the child with the proper knowledge and not to mention the societal interactions that they need in order to live a healthy, young, playful and carefree life that any child deserves.\n\nThere are three typical adjustment patterns adopted by adults with hearing loss. The first one is to remain withdrawn into your own self. This provides a sense of safety and familiarity which can be a comforting way to lead your life. The second is to act \"as if\" one does not even have hearing loss. A positive attitude will help people to live a life with no barriers and thus, engage in optimal interaction. The final and third pattern is for the person to accept their hearing loss as a part of them without undervaluing oneself. This means understanding that one is forced to live life with this disability, however it is not the only thing that constitutes life's meaning. Furthermore, many feel as if their inability to hear others during conversation is their fault. It's important that these individuals learn how to become more assertive individuals who do not lack fear when it comes to asking someone to repeat something or to speak a little louder. Although there is much fatigue and frustration that is produced from one's inability to hear, it is important to learn from personal experiences in order to improve on one's communication skills. In essence, these patterns will help adults with hearing loss deal with the communication barriers that are present.<ref name=\"SCHERER\">{{cite book | vauthors = Scherer MJ | date = 2004 | chapter = The Personal Meaning of Hearing or Vision Loss. | title = Connecting To Learn Educational and Assistive Technology for People With Disabilities | pages = 41\u201355 | location = Washington, DC | publisher = American Psychological Association }}</ref>\n\n====Workplace====\nIn most instances, people who are deaf find themselves working with hearing colleagues, where they can often be cut off from the communication going on around them. Interpreters can be provided for meetings and workshops, however are seldom provided for everyday work interactions. Communication of important information needed for jobs typically comes in the form of written or verbal summaries, which do not convey subtle meanings such as tone of voice, side conversations during group discussions, and body language. This can result in confusion and misunderstanding for the worker who is deaf, therefore making it harder to do their job effectively. Additionally, deaf workers can be unintentionally left out of professional networks, informal gatherings, and casual conversations among their collogues. Information about informal rules and organizational culture in the workplace is often communicated though these types of interactions, which puts the worker who is deaf at a professional and personal disadvantage. This could sever their [[job performance]] due to lack of access to information and therefore, reduce their opportunity to form relationships with their co-workers. Additionally, these communication barriers can all affect a deaf person's career development. Since being able to effectively communicate with one's co-workers and other people relevant to one's job is essential to managerial positions, people with hearing loss can often be denied such opportunities.<ref name=\"FOSTER\" />\n\nTo avoid these situations in the workplace, individuals can take full-time or part-time sign language courses. In this way, they can become better able to communicate with the deaf and hard of hearing. Such courses teach the American Sign Language (ASL) language as most North Americans use this particular language to communicate. It is a visual language made up of specific gestures (signs), hand shapes, and facial expressions that contain their own unique grammatical rules and sentence structures<ref>Sign Language Classes for Individuals. (2013, January 1). Retrieved November 5, 2014.</ref> By completing sign language courses, it ensures that deaf individuals feel a part of the workplace and have the ability to communicate with their co-workers and employer in the manner as other hearing employees do.\n\n====Health care====\nNot only can communication barriers between deaf and hearing people affect family relationships, work, and school, but they can also have a very significant effect on a deaf individual's physical and [[Deaf mental health care|mental health care]]. As a result of poor communication between the health care professional and the deaf or hard of hearing patient, many patients report that they are not properly informed about their disease and prognosis.<ref name=\"Medicina\">Medicina Oral, Patolog\u00eda Oral y Cirug\u00eda Bucal.

Poor communication in this setting is often the result of health care providers having the misconception that all people who are deaf or hard of hearing have the same type of hearing loss, and require the same type of communication methods. In reality, there are many different types and range of hearing loss, and in order to communicate effectively a health care provider needs to understand that each individual with hearing loss has unique needs. This affects how individuals have been educated to communicate, as some communication methods work better depending on an individual's severity of hearing loss. For example, assuming every deaf or hard of hearing patient knows American Sign Language would be incorrect because there are different types of sign language, each varying in signs and meanings. A patient could have been educated to use cued speech which is entirely different from ASL.<ref name=\"Medicina\" /> Therefore, in order to communicate effectively, a health care provider needs to understand that each individual has unique needs when communicating.\n\nAlthough there are specific laws and rules to govern communication between health care professionals and people who are deaf, they are not always followed due to the health care professional's insufficient knowledge of communication techniques. This lack of knowledge can lead them to make assumptions about communicating with someone who is deaf, which can in turn cause them to use an unsuitable form of communication.\nActs in countries such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) state that all health care providers are required to provide reasonable communication accommodations when caring for patients who are deaf. These accommodations could include qualified sign language interpreters, CDIs, and technology such as Internet interpretation services. A qualified sign language interpreter will enhance communication between a deaf individual and a health care professional by interpreting not only a health professional's verbal communication, but also their non-verbal such as expressions, perceptions, and body language. A Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI) is a sign language interpreter who is also a member of the Deaf community.<ref>Ramstead, A. (2014, January 15). The Role of the Certified Deaf Interpreter. Retrieved November 2, 2014, from {{cite web |url=http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |title=The Role of the Deaf Interpreter |access-date=2014-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141105190523/http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |archive-date=2014-11-05 }}</ref> They accompany a sign language interpreter and are useful for communication with deaf individuals who also have language or cognitive deficits. A CDI will transform what the health care professional communicates into basic, simple language. This method takes much longer, however it can also be more effective than other techniques. Internet interpretation services are convenient and less costly, but can potentially pose significant risks. They involve the use of a sign language interpreter over a video device rather than directly in the room. This can often be an inaccurate form of communication because the interpreter may not be licensed, is often unfamiliar with the patient and their signs, and can lack knowledge of medical terminology.<ref>Schuler, G., Mistler, L., Torrey, K., & Depukat, R. (2013). Bridging Communication Gaps with the Deaf. Nursing, 43(11), 24-30.</ref>\n\nAside from utilizing interpreters, healthcare professionals can improve their communication with deaf or hard of hearing patients by educating themselves on common misconceptions and proper practices depending on the patient's needs. For example, a common misconception is that exaggerating words and speaking loudly will help the patient understand more clearly. However, many individuals with hearing loss depend on lip-reading to identify words. Exaggerated pronunciation and a raised voice can distort the lips, making it even more difficult to understand. Another common mistake health care professionals make are the use of single words rather than full sentences. Although language should be kept simple and short, keeping context is important because certain homophonous words are difficult to distinguish by lip-reading. Health care professionals can further improve their own communication with their patients by eliminating any background noise and positioning themselves in a way where their face is clearly visible to the patient, and suitably lit. The healthcare professional should know how to use body language and facial expressions to properly communicate different feelings.<ref name=\"Medicina\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n===Stem cell transplant and gene therapy===\nA 2005 study achieved successful [[regrowth of cochlea cells]] in guinea pigs.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | title=Gene therapy is first deafness 'cure' | work=NewScientist.com News Service | first=Andy | last=Coghlan | name-list-format = vanc | date=2005-02-14 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914114532/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | archive-date=2008-09-14 }}</ref> However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain.

They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information for frequencies by the rate that neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane in a synchronous manner. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding.<ref name=\"Carlson, N.

acuity to sounds normally heard.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> The terms hearing impaired or hard of hearing are usually reserved for people who have relative inability to hear sound in the speech frequencies. The severity of a hearing loss is categorized according to the increase in intensity of sound above the usual level necessary before the listener can detect it.\n*Deafness is defined as a degree of loss such that a person is unable to understand speech even in the presence of amplification.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> In profound deafness, even the highest intensity sounds produced by an [[audiometer]] (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, are heard.\n*[[Speech perception]] \u2013 Another aspect of hearing involves the perceived clarity of a word rather than the intensity of sound made by the word. In humans, that aspect is usually measured by tests of speech discrimination. These tests measure one's ability to understand speech, not to merely detect sound. There are very rare types of hearing loss which affect speech discrimination alone.  One example is [[auditory neuropathy]], a variety of hearing loss in which the outer hair cells of the cochlea are intact and functioning, but sound information is not faithfully transmitted to the auditory nerve and brain properly.<ref name=\"eBook1\">eBook: ''Current Diagnosis & Treatment in Otolaryngology: Head & Neck Surgery'', Lalwani, Anil K.

Sound is generally uncomfortably loud above 90&nbsp;dB and 115&nbsp;dB represents the [[threshold of pain]]. The ear does not hear all frequencies equally well; hearing sensitivity peaks around 3000&nbsp;Hz.  There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and intensity that cannot easily be measured quantitatively. But for many practical purposes, normal hearing is defined by a frequency versus intensity graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies.  Because of the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other acoustic insults, 'typical' hearing may not be normal.<ref>ANSI 7029:2000/BS 6951 Acoustics - Statistical distribution of hearing thresholds as a function of age</ref><ref>ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech Intelligibility Index (SII)</ref>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n*difficulty using the [[telephone]]\n*loss of [[Sound localization|directionality of sound]]\n*difficulty [[Speech perception|understanding speech]], especially of children and women whose voices are of a [[Voice frequency#Fundamental frequency|higher frequency]].\n*difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise ([[cocktail party effect]])\n*sounds or speech becoming dull, muffled or attenuated\n*need for increased volume on television, radio, music and other audio sources\n\nHearing loss is sensory, but may have accompanying symptoms:\n*pain or pressure in the ears\n*a blocked feeling\n\nThere may also be accompanying secondary symptoms:\n*[[hyperacusis]], heightened sensitivity with accompanying auditory pain to certain intensities and frequencies of sound, sometimes defined as \"[[auditory recruitment]]\"\n*[[tinnitus]], ringing, buzzing, hissing or other sounds in the ear when no external sound is present\n*[[vertigo]] and disequilibrium\n*[[Autophony|tympanophonia]], also known as autophonia, abnormal hearing of one's own voice and respiratory sounds, usually as a result of a patulous (a constantly open) eustachian tube or dehiscent superior semicircular canals\n*disturbances of facial movement (indicating a possible tumour or stroke) or in persons with [[Bell's palsy|Bell's Palsy]]\n\n=== Complications ===\nHearing loss is associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[dementia]].

Estimation of a \"safe\" duration of exposure is possible using an ''exchange rate'' of 3&nbsp;dB. As 3&nbsp;dB represents a doubling of the intensity of sound, duration of exposure must be cut in half to maintain the same energy dose. For workplace noise regulation, the \"safe\" daily exposure amount at 85&nbsp;dB A, known as an [[exposure action value]], is 8 hours, while the \"safe\" exposure at 91&nbsp;dB(A) is only 2 hours.<ref>Occupational Noise Exposure, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 98-126</ref>\nDifferent standards use exposure action values between 80dBA and 90dBA. Note that for some people, sound may be damaging at even lower levels than 85&nbsp;dB A. Exposures to other ototoxins (such as pesticides, some medications including chemotherapy agents, solvents, etc.) can lead to greater susceptibility to noise damage, as well as causing its own damage. This is called a ''synergistic'' interaction.  Since noise damage is cumulative over long periods of time, persons who are exposed to non-workplace noise, like recreational activities or environmental noise, may have compounding damage from all sources.\n\nSome national and international organizations and agencies use an exchange rate of 4&nbsp;dB or 5&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| title=Compliance Guide to MSHA's Occupational Noise Exposure Standard, APPENDIX B \u2013 GLOSSARY OF TERMS| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112204458/http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| archive-date=2013-11-12| access-date=2013-11-12}}</ref> While these exchange rates may indicate a wider zone of comfort or safety, they can significantly underestimate the damage caused by loud noise. For example, at 100&nbsp;dB (nightclub music level), a 3&nbsp;dB exchange rate would limit exposure to 15 minutes; the 5&nbsp;dB exchange rate allows an hour.\n\nMany people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. If one is exposed to loud sound (including music) at high levels or for extended durations (85&nbsp;dB A or greater), then hearing loss will occur. Sound intensity (sound energy, or propensity to cause damage to the ears) increases dramatically with proximity according to an inverse square law: halving the distance to the sound quadruples the sound intensity.\n\nIn the US, 12.5% of children aged 6\u201319 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure.<ref name=\"kid\">{{cite web| url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss: Promoting Hearing Health Among Youth| work=CDC Healthy Youth!| publisher=CDC| date=2009-07-01| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221020243/http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| archive-date=2009-12-21}}</ref>  The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using [[personal audio devices]] that are too loud.<ref name=WHO2015Aud/>\n\nHearing loss due to noise has been described as primarily a condition of modern society.<ref name=Go2007>{{cite journal| last1=Goines| first1=Lisa| last2=Hagler| first2=Louis| name-list-format = vanc | title=Noise Pollution: A Modern Plague| journal=Southern Medical Journal| date=March 2007| volume=100| issue=3| pages=287\u2013294 | citeseerx=10.1.1.504.8717| doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e3180318be5| pmid=17396733}}</ref> In preindustrial times, humans had far less exposure to loud sounds.

Syndromic deafness occurs when there are other signs or medical problems aside from deafness in an individual. This accounts for around 30% of deaf individuals who are deaf from a genetic standpoint.<ref name=Harvard /> Nonsyndromic deafness occurs when there are no other signs or medical problems associated with an individual other than deafness. From a genetic standpoint, this accounts for the other 70% of cases, and represents the majority of hereditary hearing loss.<ref name=Harvard /> Syndromic cases occur with disorders such as [[Usher syndrome]], [[Stickler syndrome]], [[Waardenburg syndrome]], [[Alport's syndrome]], and [[neurofibromatosis type 2]]. These are diseases that have deafness as one of the symptoms or as a common feature associated with it. Many of the genetic mutations giving rise to syndromic deafness have been identified. In nonsyndromic cases, where deafness is the only finding, it is more difficult to identify the genetic mutation although some have been discovered.\n\n* Gene mapping has identified the genetic locations for several nonsyndromic dominant (DFNA#) and recessive (DFNB#) forms of deafness. The first gene mapped for non-syndromic deafness, DFNA1, involves a splice site mutation in the formin related homolog diaphanous 1 (DIAPH1).

Inside the booth a middle aged man can be seen wearing headphones and is looking straight ahead of himself, not at the [[audiologist]], and appears to be concentrating on hearing something]]\n\nIdentification of a hearing loss is usually conducted by a general practitioner [[medical doctor]], [[otolaryngologist]], certified and licensed [[audiologist]], school or industrial [[audiometrist]], or other audiometric technician. Diagnosis of the cause of a hearing loss is carried out by a specialist physician (audiovestibular physician) or [[otorhinolaryngologist]].\n\n===Case history===\nA case history (usually a written form, with questionnaire) can provide valuable information about the context of the hearing loss, and indicate what kind of diagnostic procedures to employ.

Hearing sensitivity varies according to the [[frequency]] of sounds. To take this into account, hearing sensitivity can be measured for a range of frequencies and plotted on an [[audiogram]].\n\nOther method for quantifying hearing loss is a [[hearing test]] using a mobile application or [[hearing aid application]], which includes a [[hearing test]].<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shojaeemend H, Ayatollahi H | title = Automated Audiometry: A Review of the Implementation and Evaluation Methods | journal = Healthcare Informatics Research | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 263\u2013275 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30443414 | pmc = 6230538 | doi = 10.4258/hir.2018.24.4.263 }}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Keidser G, Convery E | title = Self-Fitting Hearing Aids: Status Quo and Future Predictions | journal = Trends in Hearing | volume = 20 | pages = 233121651664328 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27072929 | pmc = 4871211 | doi = 10.1177/2331216516643284 }}</ref> Hearing diagnosis using mobile application is similar to the [[audiometry]] procedure.

As the name implies, a speech-in-noise test gives an indication of how well one can understand speech in a noisy environment. A person with a hearing loss will often be less able to understand speech, especially in noisy conditions. This is especially true for people who have a sensorineural loss \u2013 which is by far the most common type of hearing loss. As such, speech-in-noise tests can provide valuable information about a person's hearing ability, and can be used to detect the presence of a sensorineural hearing loss. A recently developed digit-triple speech-in-noise test may be a more efficient screening test.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jansen S, Luts H, Dejonckere P, van Wieringen A, Wouters J | title = Efficient hearing screening in noise-exposed listeners using the digit triplet test | journal = Ear and Hearing | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 773\u20138 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23782715 | doi = 10.1097/AUD.0b013e318297920b | url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/398543/2/Jansen_Ear%26Hearing_2013.pdf }}</ref>\n\nOtoacoustic emissions test is an objective hearing test that may be administered to toddlers and children too young to cooperate in a conventional hearing test. The test is also useful in older children and adults and is an important measure in diagnosing auditory neuropathy described above.\n\nAuditory brainstem response testing is an electrophysiological test used to test for hearing deficits caused by pathology within the ear, the cochlear nerve and also within the brainstem. This test can be used to identify delay in the conduction of neural impulses due to tumours or inflammation but can also be an objective test of hearing thresholds. Other electrophysiological tests, such as cortical evoked responses, can look at the hearing pathway up to the level of the auditory cortex.\n\n===Scans===\n{{contradictory|date=August 2019}}\nMRI and CT scans can be useful to identify the pathology of many causes of hearing loss. They are only needed in selected cases.{{vague|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Classification===\nHearing loss is categorized by type, severity, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral).  Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive.\n\n====Severity====\nThe severity of a hearing loss is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds in which a sound must be so it can be detected by an individual. It is measured in [[decibel]]s of hearing loss, or dB HL. The measurement of hearing loss in an individual is conducted over several [[frequency|frequencies]], mostly 500&nbsp;Hz, 1000&nbsp;Hz, 2000&nbsp;Hz and 4000&nbsp;Hz. The hearing loss of the individual is the average of the hearing loss values over the different frequencies. Hearing loss can be ranked differently according to different organisations; and so, in different countries different systems are in use.\n\nHearing loss may be ranked as slight, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound as defined below:{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n* Slight: between 16 and 25&nbsp;dB HL\n* Mild:\n** for adults: between 26 and 40&nbsp;dB HL\n** for children: between 20 and 40&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Moderate: between 41 and 54&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Moderately severe: between 55 and 70&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Severe: between 71 and 90&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Profound: 91&nbsp;dB HL or greater<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Totally deaf: Have no hearing at all.  This is called ''anacusis''.\n\nThe 'Audiometric Classifications of Hearing Impairment' according to the International Bureau Audiophonology (BIAP) in Belgium is as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=BIAP Recommendation 02/1 bis - AUDIOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF HEARING IMPAIRMENTS|url=https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|website=biap.org|publisher=International Bureau Audiophonology|access-date=18 June 2017|date=26 October 1996|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908010426/https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref>\n* Normal or subnormal hearing: average tone loss is equal or below 20&nbsp;dB HL\n* Mild hearing loss: average tone loss between 21 and 40&nbsp;dB HL\n* Moderate hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 41 and 55&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 56 and 70&nbsp;dB HL\n* Severe hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 71 and 80&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 81 and 90&nbsp;dB HL\n* Very severe hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 91 and 100&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 101 and 110&nbsp;dB HL\n** Third degree: average tone loss between 111 and 119&nbsp;dB HL\n* Total hearing loss or Cophosis: average tone loss is equal or more than 120&nbsp;dB HL\n\nHearing loss may affect one or both ears. If both ears are affected, then one ear may be more affected than the other.  Thus it is possible, for example, to have normal hearing in one ear and none at all in the other, or to have mild hearing loss in one ear and moderate hearing loss in the other.\n\nFor certain legal purposes such as insurance claims, hearing loss is described in terms of percentages. Given that hearing loss can vary by frequency and that audiograms are plotted with a logarithmic scale, the idea of a percentage of hearing loss is somewhat arbitrary, but where decibels of loss are converted via a legally recognized formula, it is possible to calculate a standardized \"percentage of hearing loss\", which is suitable for legal purposes only.\n\n====Type====\nThere are three main types of hearing loss, [[conductive hearing loss]], [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. Combinations of conductive and sensorineural hearing losses are called a mixed hearing loss.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is [[auditory processing disorder]] which is not a hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound.\n\n*Conductive hearing loss\nConductive hearing loss is present when the sound is not reaching the inner ear, the [[cochlea]]. This can be due to external ear canal malformation, dysfunction of the eardrum or malfunction of the bones of the middle ear. The eardrum may show defects from small to total resulting in hearing loss of different degree. [[Granulation tissue|Scar tissue]] after ear infections may also make the eardrum dysfunction as well as when it is retracted and adherent to the medial part of the middle ear.\n\nDysfunction of the three small bones of the [[middle ear]] \u2013 malleus, incus, and stapes \u2013 may cause conductive hearing loss. The mobility of the [[ossicles]] may be impaired for different reasons including a boney disorder of the ossicles called [[otosclerosis]] and disruption of the ossicular chain due to trauma, infection or [[ankylosis]] may also cause hearing loss.\n\n*Sensorineural hearing loss\nSensorineural hearing loss is one caused by dysfunction of the inner ear, the cochlea or the nerve that transmits the impulses from the cochlea to the hearing centre in the brain. The most common reason for sensorineural hearing loss is damage to the [[hair cells]] in the cochlea. Depending on the definition it could be estimated that more than 50% of the population over the age of 70 has impaired hearing.<ref name=\"RussellPineYoung2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell JL, Pine HS, Young DL | title = Pediatric cochlear implantation: expanding applications and outcomes | journal = Pediatric Clinics of North America | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 841\u201363 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23905823 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2013.04.008 }}</ref>\n\n*Central deafness\nDamage to the brain can lead to a central deafness. The peripheral ear and the auditory nerve may function well but the central connections are damaged by tumour, trauma or other disease and the patient is unable to process speech information.\n\n*Mixed hearing loss\nMixed hearing loss is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Chronic ear infection (a fairly common diagnosis) can cause a defective [[ear drum]] or middle-ear ossicle damages, or both.  In addition to the conductive loss, a sensory component may be present.\n\n*Central [[auditory processing disorder]]\n\nThis is not an actual hearing loss but gives rise to significant difficulties in hearing. One kind of auditory processing disorder is [[King-Kopetzky syndrome]], which is characterized by an inability to process out background noise in noisy environments despite normal performance on traditional hearing tests. An [[auditory processing disorder]]s is sometimes linked to language disorders in persons of all ages.\n\n====Configuration====\nThe shape of an audiogram shows the relative configuration of the hearing loss, such as a [[Carhart notch]] for otosclerosis, 'noise' notch for noise-induced damage, high frequency rolloff for presbycusis, or a flat audiogram for conductive hearing loss. In conjunction with speech audiometry, it may indicate central auditory processing disorder, or the presence of a [[schwannoma]] or other tumor.\nThere are four general configurations of hearing loss:\n\n1. Flat: thresholds essentially equal across test frequencies.\n\n2. Sloping: lower (better) thresholds in low-frequency regions and higher (poorer) thresholds in high-frequency regions.\n\n3. Rising: higher (poorer) thresholds in low-frequency regions and lower (better) thresholds in higher-frequency regions.\n\n4. Trough-shaped (\"cookie-bite\" or \"U\" shaped): greatest hearing loss in the mid-frequency range, with lower (better) thresholds in low- and high-frequency regions.\n\n====Unilateral and bilateral====\nPeople with [[unilateral hearing loss]] or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in:\n\n*hearing conversation on their impaired side\n*localizing sound\n*understanding speech in the presence of background noise.\n\nIn quiet conditions, speech discrimination is approximately the same for normal hearing and those with unilateral deafness; however, in noisy environments speech discrimination varies individually and ranges from mild to severe.\n\nOne reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the [[head shadow effect]]. Newborn children with no hearing on one side but one normal ear could still have problems.<ref name=\"pmid15148171\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lieu JE | title = Speech-language and educational consequences of unilateral hearing loss in children | journal = Archives of Otolaryngology\u2013Head & Neck Surgery | volume = 130 | issue = 5 | pages = 524\u201330 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15148171 | doi = 10.1001/archotol.130.5.524 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Speech development could be delayed and difficulties to concentrate in school are common.

Much of the negative reaction to cochlear implants stems from the medical viewpoint that deafness is a condition that needs to be \"cured,\" while the Deaf community instead regards deafness a defining cultural characteristic.\n\nMany other assistive devices are more acceptable to the Deaf community, including but not limited to, hearing aids, [[closed captioning]], email and the Internet, text telephones, and video relay services.\n\n==Sign language==\n{{Main|Sign language}}\n[[File:Drawing (sign language friend), 2008.jpg|thumb|The sign language for \"friend\".]]\nSign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This involves the simultaneous combination of hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to express a speaker's thoughts. \"Sign languages are based on the idea that vision is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information\".<ref>{{cite web|title=American Sign Language|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language#1|website=NIDCD|access-date=17 November 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115163913/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language#1|archive-date=15 November 2016|date=2015-08-18}}</ref>\n\n===Government policies===\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=December 2012}}\n[[File:Texas School for the Deaf main gate.jpg|thumb|[[Texas School for the Deaf]]]]\nThose who are deaf (by either state or federal standards) have access to a free and appropriate public education.

An argument supporting inclusion, on the other hand, exposes the student to people who are not just like them, preparing them for adult life. Through interacting, children with hearing disabilities can expose themselves to other cultures which in the future may be beneficial for them when it comes to finding jobs and living on their own in a society where their disability may put them in the minority. These are some reasons why a person may or may not want to put their child in an inclusion classroom.<ref name=\"SmithDD2010\" />\n\n====Family====\nThe communication limitations between people who are deaf and their hearing family members can often cause difficulties in family relationships, and affect the strength of relationships among individual family members. It was found that most people who are deaf have hearing parents, which means that the channel that the child and parents communicate through can be very different, often affecting their relationship in a negative way. If a parent communicates best verbally, and their child communicates best using sign language, this could result in ineffective communication between parents and children. Ineffective communication can potentially lead to fights caused by misunderstanding, less willingness to talk about life events and issues, and an overall weaker relationship. Even if individuals in the family made an effort to learn deaf communication techniques such as sign language, a deaf family member often will feel excluded from casual banter; such as the exchange of daily events and news at the dinner table. It is often difficult for people who are deaf to follow these conversations due to the fast-paced and overlapping nature of these exchanges. This can cause a deaf individual to become frustrated and take part in less family conversations. This can potentially result in weaker relationships between the hearing individual and their immediate family members. This communication barrier can have a particularly negative effect on relationships with extended family members as well. Communication between a deaf individual and their extended family members can be very difficult due to the gap in verbal and non-verbal communication. This can cause the individuals to feel frustrated and unwilling to put effort into communicating effectively. The lack of effort put into communicating can result in anger, miscommunication, and unwillingness to build a strong relationship.<ref name=\"FOSTER\">{{cite book | vauthors = Foster S | date = 1996 | chapter = Communication experiences of deaf people: An ethnographic account. | veditors = Parasnis I | title = Cultural and language diversity of the deaf experience | pages = 117\u2013136 | location = New York | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}</ref>\n\n====Community====\n[[File:Alexander Graham Bell and his Scott Circle School.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Graham Bell]] with teachers and students of the Scott Circle School for deaf children, Washington, D.C., 1883]]\nPeople who have hearing loss can often experience many difficulties as a result of communication barriers among them and other hearing individuals in the community. Some major areas that can be impacted by this are involvement in extracurricular activities and social relationships. For young people, extracurricular activities are vehicles for physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development. However, it is often the case that communication barriers between people who are deaf and their hearing peers and coaches/club advisors limit them from getting involved. These communication barriers make it difficult for someone with a hearing loss to understand directions, take advice, collaborate, and form bonding relationships with other team or club members. As a result, extracurricular activities such as sports teams, clubs, and volunteering are often not as enjoyable and beneficial for individuals who have hearing loss, and they may engage in them less often. A lack of community involvement through extracurricular activities may also limit the individual's social network. In general, it can be difficult for someone who is deaf to develop and maintain friendships with their hearing peers due to the communication gap that they experience. They can often miss the jokes, informal banter, and \"messing around\" that is associated with the formation of many friendships among young people. Conversations between people who are deaf and their hearing peers can often be limited and short due to their differences in communication methods and lack of knowledge on how to overcome these differences. Deaf individuals can often experience rejection by hearing peers who are not willing to make an effort to find their way around communication difficulties. Patience and motivation to overcome such communication barriers is required by both the deaf or hard of hearing and hearing individuals in order to establish and maintain good friendships.<ref name=\"FOSTER\" />\n\nMany people tend to forget about the difficulties that deaf children encounter, as they view the deaf child differently from a deaf adult. Deaf children grow up being unable to fully communicate with their parents, siblings and other family members. Examples include being unable to tell their family what they have learned, what they did, asking for help, or even simply being unable to interact in daily conversation. Deaf children have to learn sign language and to read lips at a young age, however they cannot communicate with others using it unless the others are educated in sign language as well. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing are faced with many complications while growing up, for example some children have to wear hearing aids and others require assistance from sign language (ASL) interpreters. The interpreters help them to communicate with other individuals until they develop the skills they need to efficiently communicate on their own. Although growing up for deaf children may entitle more difficulties than for other children, there are many support groups that allow deaf children to interact with other children. This is where they develop friendships. There are also classes for young children to learn sign language in an environment that has other children in their same situation and around their same age. These groups and classes can be very beneficial in providing the child with the proper knowledge and not to mention the societal interactions that they need in order to live a healthy, young, playful and carefree life that any child deserves.\n\nThere are three typical adjustment patterns adopted by adults with hearing loss. The first one is to remain withdrawn into your own self. This provides a sense of safety and familiarity which can be a comforting way to lead your life. The second is to act \"as if\" one does not even have hearing loss. A positive attitude will help people to live a life with no barriers and thus, engage in optimal interaction. The final and third pattern is for the person to accept their hearing loss as a part of them without undervaluing oneself. This means understanding that one is forced to live life with this disability, however it is not the only thing that constitutes life's meaning. Furthermore, many feel as if their inability to hear others during conversation is their fault. It's important that these individuals learn how to become more assertive individuals who do not lack fear when it comes to asking someone to repeat something or to speak a little louder. Although there is much fatigue and frustration that is produced from one's inability to hear, it is important to learn from personal experiences in order to improve on one's communication skills. In essence, these patterns will help adults with hearing loss deal with the communication barriers that are present.<ref name=\"SCHERER\">{{cite book | vauthors = Scherer MJ | date = 2004 | chapter = The Personal Meaning of Hearing or Vision Loss. | title = Connecting To Learn Educational and Assistive Technology for People With Disabilities | pages = 41\u201355 | location = Washington, DC | publisher = American Psychological Association }}</ref>\n\n====Workplace====\nIn most instances, people who are deaf find themselves working with hearing colleagues, where they can often be cut off from the communication going on around them. Interpreters can be provided for meetings and workshops, however are seldom provided for everyday work interactions. Communication of important information needed for jobs typically comes in the form of written or verbal summaries, which do not convey subtle meanings such as tone of voice, side conversations during group discussions, and body language. This can result in confusion and misunderstanding for the worker who is deaf, therefore making it harder to do their job effectively. Additionally, deaf workers can be unintentionally left out of professional networks, informal gatherings, and casual conversations among their collogues. Information about informal rules and organizational culture in the workplace is often communicated though these types of interactions, which puts the worker who is deaf at a professional and personal disadvantage. This could sever their [[job performance]] due to lack of access to information and therefore, reduce their opportunity to form relationships with their co-workers. Additionally, these communication barriers can all affect a deaf person's career development. Since being able to effectively communicate with one's co-workers and other people relevant to one's job is essential to managerial positions, people with hearing loss can often be denied such opportunities.<ref name=\"FOSTER\" />\n\nTo avoid these situations in the workplace, individuals can take full-time or part-time sign language courses. In this way, they can become better able to communicate with the deaf and hard of hearing. Such courses teach the American Sign Language (ASL) language as most North Americans use this particular language to communicate. It is a visual language made up of specific gestures (signs), hand shapes, and facial expressions that contain their own unique grammatical rules and sentence structures<ref>Sign Language Classes for Individuals. (2013, January 1). Retrieved November 5, 2014.</ref> By completing sign language courses, it ensures that deaf individuals feel a part of the workplace and have the ability to communicate with their co-workers and employer in the manner as other hearing employees do.\n\n====Health care====\nNot only can communication barriers between deaf and hearing people affect family relationships, work, and school, but they can also have a very significant effect on a deaf individual's physical and [[Deaf mental health care|mental health care]]. As a result of poor communication between the health care professional and the deaf or hard of hearing patient, many patients report that they are not properly informed about their disease and prognosis.<ref name=\"Medicina\">Medicina Oral, Patolog\u00eda Oral y Cirug\u00eda Bucal. (2007, January 1). Retrieved October 31, 2014, from {{cite journal | vauthors = Alsmark SS, Garc\u00eda J, Mart\u00ednez MR, L\u00f3pez NE | title = How to improve communication with deaf children in the dental clinic | journal = Medicina Oral, Patologia Oral y Cirugia Bucal | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = E576-81 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18059242 | url = http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?pid=S1698-69462007000800007&script=sci_arttext | access-date = 2014-11-05 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141105235645/http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?pid=S1698-69462007000800007&script=sci_arttext | archive-date = 2014-11-05 }}</ref>\nThis lack of or poor communication could also lead to other issues such as misdiagnosis, poor assessments, mistreatment, and even possibly harm to patients. Poor communication in this setting is often the result of health care providers having the misconception that all people who are deaf or hard of hearing have the same type of hearing loss, and require the same type of communication methods. In reality, there are many different types and range of hearing loss, and in order to communicate effectively a health care provider needs to understand that each individual with hearing loss has unique needs. This affects how individuals have been educated to communicate, as some communication methods work better depending on an individual's severity of hearing loss. For example, assuming every deaf or hard of hearing patient knows American Sign Language would be incorrect because there are different types of sign language, each varying in signs and meanings. A patient could have been educated to use cued speech which is entirely different from ASL.<ref name=\"Medicina\" /> Therefore, in order to communicate effectively, a health care provider needs to understand that each individual has unique needs when communicating.\n\nAlthough there are specific laws and rules to govern communication between health care professionals and people who are deaf, they are not always followed due to the health care professional's insufficient knowledge of communication techniques. This lack of knowledge can lead them to make assumptions about communicating with someone who is deaf, which can in turn cause them to use an unsuitable form of communication.\nActs in countries such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) state that all health care providers are required to provide reasonable communication accommodations when caring for patients who are deaf. These accommodations could include qualified sign language interpreters, CDIs, and technology such as Internet interpretation services. A qualified sign language interpreter will enhance communication between a deaf individual and a health care professional by interpreting not only a health professional's verbal communication, but also their non-verbal such as expressions, perceptions, and body language. A Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI) is a sign language interpreter who is also a member of the Deaf community.<ref>Ramstead, A. (2014, January 15). The Role of the Certified Deaf Interpreter. Retrieved November 2, 2014, from {{cite web |url=http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |title=The Role of the Deaf Interpreter |access-date=2014-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141105190523/http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |archive-date=2014-11-05 }}</ref> They accompany a sign language interpreter and are useful for communication with deaf individuals who also have language or cognitive deficits. A CDI will transform what the health care professional communicates into basic, simple language. This method takes much longer, however it can also be more effective than other techniques. Internet interpretation services are convenient and less costly, but can potentially pose significant risks. They involve the use of a sign language interpreter over a video device rather than directly in the room. This can often be an inaccurate form of communication because the interpreter may not be licensed, is often unfamiliar with the patient and their signs, and can lack knowledge of medical terminology.<ref>Schuler, G., Mistler, L., Torrey, K., & Depukat, R. (2013). Bridging Communication Gaps with the Deaf. Nursing, 43(11), 24-30.</ref>\n\nAside from utilizing interpreters, healthcare professionals can improve their communication with deaf or hard of hearing patients by educating themselves on common misconceptions and proper practices depending on the patient's needs. For example, a common misconception is that exaggerating words and speaking loudly will help the patient understand more clearly. However, many individuals with hearing loss depend on lip-reading to identify words. Exaggerated pronunciation and a raised voice can distort the lips, making it even more difficult to understand. Another common mistake health care professionals make are the use of single words rather than full sentences. Although language should be kept simple and short, keeping context is important because certain homophonous words are difficult to distinguish by lip-reading. Health care professionals can further improve their own communication with their patients by eliminating any background noise and positioning themselves in a way where their face is clearly visible to the patient, and suitably lit. The healthcare professional should know how to use body language and facial expressions to properly communicate different feelings.<ref name=\"Medicina\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n===Stem cell transplant and gene therapy===\nA 2005 study achieved successful [[regrowth of cochlea cells]] in guinea pigs.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | title=Gene therapy is first deafness 'cure' | work=NewScientist.com News Service | first=Andy | last=Coghlan | name-list-format = vanc | date=2005-02-14 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914114532/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | archive-date=2008-09-14 }}</ref> However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain.
