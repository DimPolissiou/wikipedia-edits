Towns are generally larger than [[village]]s but smaller than [[city|cities]], though the criteria to distinguish them vary considerably between different parts of the world. Humans make towns to hide from their crippling addiction to sitcoms.\n\n== Origin and use ==\nThe word \"town\" shares an origin with the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|Zaun}}, the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word {{lang|nl|tuin}}, and the [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|tun}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/town|title=Town|publisher=Dictionary.com}}</ref> The original [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] word, *''tunan'', is thought to be an early borrowing from [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] *''dunon'' (cf. [[Old Irish]] {{lang|sga|dun}}, [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|din}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/town|title=Town|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>\n\nThe original sense of the word in both Germanic and Celtic was that of a fortress or an enclosure. Cognates of \"town\" in many modern Germanic languages designate a fence or a hedge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/town|title=Town|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> In English and Dutch, the meaning of the word took on the sense of the space which these fences enclosed, and through which a track must run.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In England, a town was a small community that could not afford or was not allowed to build walls or other larger fortifications, and built a [[palisade]] or stockade instead.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In the Netherlands, this space was a garden, more specifically those of the wealthy, which had a high fence or a wall around them (like the garden of the palace of [[Het Loo Palace|Het Loo]] in [[Apeldoorn]], which was the model for the privy garden of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] at [[Hampton Court]]). In Old Norse {{lang|non|tun}} means a (grassy) place between farmhouses, and the word is still used with a similar meaning in modern Norwegian.\n\nOld English ''tun'' became a common place-name suffix in England and southeastern Scotland during the Anglo-Saxon settlement period. In [[Old English]] and Early and Middle [[Scots language|Scots]], the words ''ton'', ''toun'', etc. could refer to diverse kinds of settlements from agricultural estates and holdings, partly picking up the Norse sense (as in the Scots word {{lang|sco|[[fermtoun]]}}) at one end of the scale, to fortified municipalities.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Other common Anglo-Saxon suffixes included ''ham'' (\"home\"), ''stede'' (\"stead\"), and ''burh'' (\"bury,\" \"borough,\" \"burgh\").\n\nIn some cases, \"town\" is an alternative name for \"city\" or \"village\" (especially a larger village). Sometimes, the word \"town\" is short for \"township\". In general, today towns can be differentiated from [[township]]s, [[village]]s, or [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s on the basis of their economic character, in that most of a town's population will tend to derive their living from manufacturing [[industry]], [[commerce]], and [[public service]]s rather than [[primary industry]] such as [[agriculture]] or related activities.\n\nA place's population size is not a reliable determinant of urban character. In many areas of the world, e.g. in [[India]] at least until recent times, a large village might contain several times as many people as a small town. In the [[United Kingdom]], there are historical cities [[List of urban areas in England by population|that are far smaller]] than the larger towns.\n\nThe modern phenomenon of extensive [[suburb]]an growth, satellite urban development, and migration of city dwellers to villages has further complicated the definition of towns, creating communities urban in their economic and cultural characteristics but lacking other characteristics of urban localities.\n\nSome forms of non-rural settlement, such as temporary [[mining]] locations, may be clearly non-rural, but have at best a questionable claim to be called a town.\n\nTowns often exist as distinct governmental units, with legally defined borders and some or all of the appurtenances of local government (e.g. a [[police]] force). In the United States these are referred to as \"incorporated towns\". In other cases the town lacks its own governance and is said to be \"unincorporated\". Note that the existence of an unincorporated town may be legally set out by other means, e.g. zoning districts. In the case of some [[planned community|planned communities]], the town exists legally in the form of covenants on the properties within the town. The [[United States Census]] identifies many [[census-designated place]]s (CDPs) by the names of unincorporated towns which lie within them; however, those CDPs typically include rural and suburban areas and even surrounding villages and other towns.\n\nThe distinction between a town and a city similarly depends on the approach: a city may strictly be an administrative entity which has been granted that designation by law, but in informal usage, the term is also used to denote an urban locality of a particular size or importance: whereas a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] city may have possessed as few as 10,000 inhabitants, today some{{who|date=November 2014}} consider an urban place of fewer than 100,000 as a town, even though there are many officially designated cities that are much smaller than that.\n\n== Age of towns scheme ==\n[[Australian]] geographer [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] proposed a classification of towns based on their age and pattern of [[land use]]. He identified five types of town:<ref>Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.</ref>\n\n* ''Infantile towns'', with no clear [[zoning]]\n* ''Juvenile towns'', which have developed an area of [[Retailing|shop]]s\n* ''Adolescent towns'', where [[factory|factories]] have started to appear\n* ''Early mature towns'', with a separate area of [[social class|high-class]] [[house|housing]]\n* ''Mature towns'', with defined [[industry|industrial]], [[commerce|commercial]] and various types of [[residential area]]\n\n== By country ==\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nIn [[Afghanistan]], towns and cities are known as ''sh\u0101r'' ([[Dari language|Dari]]: \u0634\u0647\u0631, [[Pashto]]: \u069a\u0627\u0631).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:687.raverty|title=A dictionary of the Puk'hto, Pus'hto, or language of the Afghans|website=dsalsrv0 2.uchicago.edu|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref> As the country is an historically rural society with few larger settlements, with major cities never holding more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants before the 2000s, the lingual tradition of the country does not discriminate between towns and cities.\n\n=== Albania ===\nIn [[Albania]] \"qytez\u00eb\" means town, which is very similar with the word for city (''\"qytet\"''). Although there is no official use of the term for any settlement. \nIn [[albanian language|Albanian]] \"qytez\u00eb\" means \"small city\" or \"new city\", while in ancient times \"small residential center within the walls of a castle\".\n\n=== Arab ===\nThe center is a population group, larger than a village, and smaller than a city. Though the village is bigger than a hamlet.\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn [[Australia]], most rural and regional centres of population can be called towns; many small towns have populations of less than 200.<ref>Australian Bureau of Statistics, \"Frequently Asked Questions\". https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Frequently+Asked+Questions#Anchor12 Retrieved 16 Oct 2019.</ref> The smallest may be described as townships.\n\nIn addition, some local government entities are officially styled as towns in [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]], and formerly also (till the 1990s) in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n=== Austria ===\n\nThe [[Austria]]n legal system does not distinguish between villages, towns, and cities. The country is partitioned into 2098 municipalities ({{lang-de|Gemeinden}}) of fundamentally equal rank. Larger municipalities are designated as market towns ({{lang-de|Marktgemeinden}}) or cities (''St\u00e4dte''), but these distinctions are purely symbolic and do not confer additional legal responsibilities. There is a number of smaller communities that are labelled cities because they used to be regional population centers in the distant past. The city of [[Rattenberg]] for example has about 400 inhabitants. The city of [[Hardegg]] has about 1200 inhabitants, although the historic city core \u2212 Hardegg proper without what used to be the surrounding hamlets \u2212 is home to just 80 souls.\n\nThere are no unincorporated areas.\n\nOf the 201 cities in Austria, 15 are [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory cities]] (''Statutarst\u00e4dte''). A statutory city is a city that is vested, in addition to its purview as a municipality, with the duties of a [[district (Austria)|district administrative authority]]. The status does not come with any additional autonomy: district administrative authorities are essentially just service centers that citizens use to interact with the national government, for example to apply for driver licenses or passports. The national government generally uses the provinces to run these points of contact on its behalf; in the case of statutory cities, the municipality gets to step up.\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Bulgaria}}\n\nBulgarians do not, in general, differentiate between 'city' and 'town'. However, in everyday language and media the terms \"large towns\" and \"small towns\" are in use. \"Large towns\" usually refers to [[Sofia]], [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and [[Burgas]], which have population over 200,000. [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] and [[Stara Zagora]] are often included as well due to presence of relatively developed infrastructure and population over 100,000 threshold. It is difficult to call the remaining [[Provinces of Bulgaria|provincial capitals]] \"large towns\" as, in general, they are less developed and have shrinking population, some with as few as 30,000 inhabitants.\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]] the [[Council of Ministers of Bulgaria|Council of Ministers]] defines what constitutes a settlement, while the [[President of Bulgaria]] grants each settlement its title. In 2005 the requirement that villages that wish to classify themselves as town must have a social and technical infrastructure, as well as a population of no fewer than 3500 people. For resort settlements the requirements are lower with the population needing to be no fewer than 1000 people but infrastructure requirements remain.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{Main|List of towns in Canada|Municipal government in Canada}}\nThe legal definition of a town in [[Canada]] varies by [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province or territory]], as each has jurisdiction over defining and legislating towns, cities and other types of municipal organization within its own boundaries.\n\nThe province of [[Quebec]] is unique in that it makes no distinction under law between towns and cities. There is no intermediate level in French between ''village'' and ''ville'' (''municipality'' is an administrative term usually applied to a legal, not geographical entity), so both are combined under the single legal status of ''[[ville]]''. While an informal preference may exist among English speakers as to whether any individual ''ville'' is commonly referred to as a city or as a town, no distinction and no objective legal criteria exist to make such a distinction under law.\n\n=== Chile ===\nIn [[Chile]], towns (Spanish: ''pueblos'') are defined by the National Statistics Institute (INE) as an urban entity with a population from 2001 to 5000 or an area with a population from 1001 to 2000 and an established economic activity.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nIn the Czech Republic, the word ''m\u011bsto'' (city) is used for very wide variety of municipalities, ranging from [[Prague]], the largest and capital city with approximately 1.2 million inhabitants, to the smallest, [[P\u0159ebuz]], with just 74 inhabitants.  Technically, a municipality must have at least 3,000 inhabitants to be granted the ''m\u011bsto'' title, although many smaller municipalities,  especially some former mining towns, retain the title ''m\u011bsto'' for historic reasons.  Currently, approximately 192 of the 592 ''m\u011bsta'' have less than 3,000 inhabitants.\n\nSome municipalities have been amalgamated together, such that the whole is considered as a ''m\u011bsto''.\n\n[[Statutory city (Czech Republic)|Statutory cities]] (''statut\u00e1rn\u00ed m\u011bsto''), which are defined by law no. 128/2000 Coll.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-128 |title=Consolidated version of Law no. 128/200 Coll |publisher=Zakonyprolidi.cz |date=2000-05-15 |accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref> can define their own self-governing municipal districts.. There are 25 such cities, in addition to [[Prague]], which is a ''de facto'' statutory city.\n\nIn 2006, the legal concept of a town (''[[m\u011bstys]]'', or formerly ''m\u011bste\u010dko'') was reintroduced. Currently, around 213 municipalities hold the title ''m\u011bstys''.\n\nMunicipalities which do not qualify as a ''m\u011bsto'' or a ''m\u011bstys'' default to the title of ''obec'' (a municipality) or, unofficially, a ''vesnice'' (village), even though they may consist of one or more villages.\n\n=== Denmark ===\nIn [[Denmark]], in many contexts no distinction is made between \"city\", \"town\" and \"village\"; all three translate as \"by\". In more specific use, for small villages and [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]] the word \"landsby\" (meaning \"country town\") is used, while the Danish equivalent of English \"city\" is \"storby\" (meaning \"large town\"). For formal purposes, [[urban area]]s having at least 200 inhabitants are counted as \"by\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/Vejviser/dokumentation/Varedeklarationer/emnegruppe/emne.aspx?sysrid=000766 |title=Byopg\u00f8relsen pr. 1. januar \u2013 Varedeklaration \u2013 Danmarks Statistik |publisher=Dst.dk |date=2005-03-22 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>\n\nHistorically some towns held various privileges, the most important of which was the right to hold market. They were administered separately from the rural areas in both fiscal, military and legal matters. Such towns are known as \"k\u00f8bstad\" (roughly the same meaning as \"borough\" albeit deriving from a different etymology) and they retain the exclusive right to the title even after the last vestiges of their privileges vanished through the reform of the local administration carried through in 1970.\n\n===Estonia===\nIn [[Estonia]], there is no distinction between a town and a city as the word ''linn'' is used for both bigger and smaller settlements, which are bigger than villages and boroughs. There are 30 [[Municipalities of Estonia|municipal towns]] (''omavalitsuslik linn'') in Estonia and a [[List of cities and towns in Estonia|further 17 towns]], which have merged with a municipal parish (''vallasisene linn'').\n\n[[File:Salins les Bains 2.JPG|thumb|The town of [[Salins-les-Bains]], [[France]]]]\n\n=== France ===\nFrom an administrative standpoint, the smallest level of local authorities are all called [[Communes of France|\"communes\"]]. Those can have anywhere from a handful to millions of inhabitants, and France has 36000 of them. The French term for \"town\" is \"[[:fr:Bourg|bourg]]\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/bourg |title=BOURG : D\u00e9finition de BOURG |date=n.d. |website=Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales' |access-date=March 22, 2020 |language=french |trans-title=BOURG: Definition of BOURG }}</ref> but French laws does not really distinguish between towns and cities which are all commonly called \"villes\". However, some laws do treat these authorities differently based on the population and different rules apply to the three big cities [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[Marseille]]. For historical reasons, [[List of French villages destroyed in World War I|six communes]] in the [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]] d\u00e9partement exist as independent administrative entities despite having no inhabitant at all.\n\nFor statistical purposes, the national statistical institute ([[INSEE]]) operates a distinction between urban areas with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants and bigger communes, the latter being called \"villes\". Smaller settlements are usually called \"villages\".\n\n[[File:Putbus (2011-05-21) 14.JPG|thumb|[[Putbus]] on [[R\u00fcgen|R\u00fcgen Island]], Germany]]\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Germany}}\n\n[[Germany|Germans]] do not, in general, differentiate between 'city' and 'town'. The German word for both is ''Stadt'', as it is the case in many other languages that do not differentiate between these Anglo-Saxon concepts. The word for a 'village', as a smaller settlement, is ''Dorf''. However, the International Statistics Conference of 1887 defined different sizes of ''Stadt'', based on their population size, as follows: ''Landstadt'' (\"country town\"; under 5,000), ''Kleinstadt'' (\"small town\"; 5,000 to 20,000), ''Mittelstadt'' (\"middle town\"; between 20,000 and 100,000) and ''Gro\u00dfstadt'' (\"large town\"; over 100,000).<ref>Universit\u00e4t Dortmund: [http://www.raumplanung.uni-dortmund.de/srp/web/dokumente/downloads/64_SRPapers%20Nr.1.pdf Kleine und mittlere St\u00e4dte \u2013 Blaupausen der Gro\u00dfstadt?], Dokumentation des Expertenkolloquiums am 29. April 2004 in Dortmund</ref> The term ''Gro\u00dfstadt'' may be translated as \"city\". In addition, Germans may speak of a ''Millionenstadt'', a city with over one million inhabitants (such as [[Munich]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]]).\n\nHistorically, many settlements became a ''Stadt'' by being awarded a [[Town privileges|''Stadtrecht'']] in medieval times. In modern German language use, the historical importance, the existence of central functions (education, retail etc.) and the population density of an urban place might also be taken as characteristics of a ''Stadt''. The modern local government organisation is subject to the laws of each [[States of Germany|state]] and refers to a ''Gemeinde'' ([[States of Germany#Municipalities (Gemeinden)|municipality]]), regardless of its historic title. While most ''Gemeinden'' form part of a ''Landkreis'' ([[States of Germany#Administrative districts (Kreise)|district]]) on a higher tier of local government, larger towns and cities may have the status of a ''kreisfreie Stadt'', combining both the powers of a municipality and a district.\n\nDesignations in different states are as diverse as e.g. in Australian States and Territories, and differ from state to state. In some German states, the words ''Markt'' (\"market\"), ''Marktflecken'' (both used in southern Germany) or ''Flecken'' (\"spot\"; northern Germany e.g. in [[Lower Saxony]]) designate a town-like residential community between ''Gemeinde'' and ''Stadt'' with special importance to its outer conurbation area. Historically those had ''Marktrecht'' (market right) but not full town privileges; see [[Market town]]. The legal denomination of a specific settlement may differ from its common designation (e.g. ''Samtgemeinde'' \u2013 a legal term in [[Lower Saxony]] for a group of villages [''Dorf'', pl. ''D\u00f6rfer''] with common local government created by combining municipalities [''Gemeinde'', pl. ''Gemeinden'']).\n\n=== Greece and Cyprus ===\nIn ordinary speech, [[Greeks]] use the word \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc (=village) to refer to smaller settlements and the word \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 or \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 (=city) to refer to larger ones. Careful speakers may also use the word \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7 to refer to towns with a population of 2,000\u20139,999. \nIn Greek administrative law there used to be a distinction between \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, i.e. municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants or considered important for some other geographical (county seats), historical or ecclesiastical (bishops' seats) reason, and \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, referring to smaller self-governing units, mostly villages. A sweeping reform, carried out in two stages early in the 21st century, merged most \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 with the nearest \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, dividing the whole country into 325 big self-governing \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9. The former municipalities survive as administrative subdivisions (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2).\n\nCyprus, including the Turkish-occupied areas, is also divided into 39 \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 (in principle, with at least 5,000 inhabitants, though there are exceptions) and 576 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2.\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Hong Kong#Towns|l1=List of cities and towns in Hong Kong}}\n[[File:ShatinTownHall 20070529.jpg|thumb|Nearly every town in Hong Kong has its own town hall. The picture shows the [[Sha Tin Town Hall]] in the town of [[Sha Tin]].]]\n\n[[Hong Kong]] started developing new towns in the 1950s, to accommodate exponential population increase. The very first new towns included [[Tsuen Wan New Town|Tsuen Wan]] and [[Kwun Tong]]. In the late 1960s and the 1970s, another stage of new town developments was launched. Nine new towns have been developed so far. Land use is carefully planned and development provides plenty of room for public housing projects. Rail transport is usually available at a later stage. The first towns are [[Sha Tin New Town|Sha Tin]], [[Tsuen Wan New Town|Tsuen Wan]], [[Tuen Mun New Town|Tuen Mun]] and [[Tseung Kwan O]]. [[Tuen Mun New Town|Tuen Mun]] was intended to be self-reliant, but was not successful and turned into a [[bedroom community]] like the other new towns. More recent developments are [[Tin Shui Wai New Town|Tin Shui Wai]] and [[North Lantau New Town|North Lantau (Tung Chung-Tai Ho)]].\n\n=== Hungary ===\nIn [[Hungary]] there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in Hungarian is: v\u00e1ros). Nevertheless, the expressions formed by adding the adjectives \"kis\" (small) and \"nagy\" (large) to the beginning of the root word (e.g. \"nagyv\u00e1ros\") have been normalized to differentiate between cities and towns (towns being smaller, therefore bearing the name \"kisv\u00e1ros\".) In Hungary, a village can gain the status of \"v\u00e1ros\" (town), if it meets a set of diverse conditions for quality of life and development of certain public services and utilities (e.g. having a local secondary school or installing full-area sewage collection pipe network). Every year the Minister of Internal Affairs selects candidates from a committee-screened list of applicants, whom the President of Republic usually affirms by issuing a bill of town's rank to them. Since being a town carries extra fiscal support from the government, many relatively small villages try to win the status of \"v\u00e1rosi rang\" nowadays.\n\nBefore the [[fall of communism]] in 1990, Hungarian villages with fewer than 10,000 residents were not allowed to become towns. Recently some settlements as small as 2,500 souls have received the rank of town (e.g. Visegr\u00e1d, Zalakaros or G\u00f6nc) and meeting the conditions of development is often disregarded to quickly elevate larger villages into towns. As of middle 2013, there are 346 towns in Hungary, encompassing some 69% of the entire population.\n\nTowns of more than 50,000 people are able to gain the status of \"megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1ros\" (town with the rights of a [[county]]), which allows them to maintain a higher degree of [[Public service|services]]. (There are a few exceptions, when towns of fewer than 50,000 people gained the status: [[\u00c9rd]], [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]], [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]] and [[Szeksz\u00e1rd]])<ref>[http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/regiok/veszpremmjv10.pdf Megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1rosok] \u2013 essay of [[Hungarian Central Statistical Office]] (Hungarian, July 2012)</ref> As of middle 2013, there are only 23 such towns in Hungary.<ref>[http://www.terport.hu/telepulesek/telepulestipusok/megyei-jogu-varosok/magyarorszag-megyei-jogu-varosai \"Magyarorsz\u00e1g megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1rosai\"] \u2013 list of Hungarian town with the rights of a county on \"T\u00e9rport\" related webpage of Ministry of National Development (Hungarian, access date: May 4, 2013.)</ref>\n\n=== Iceland ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Iceland}}\n\n=== Ireland ===\n{{Main|List of populated places in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\nThe '''Local Government act 2001''' provides that from January 1, 2002 (section 10 subsection (3)\n''Within the county in which they are situated and of which they form part, there continue to be such other local government areas as are set out in Schedule 6 which \u2013 (a) in the case of the areas set out in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of that Schedule, shall be known as boroughs, and \u2013 (b) in the case of the areas set out in Chapter 2 of Part 1 and Part 2 of that Schedule, shall be known as towns, and in this Act a reference to a town shall include a reference to a borough.''\n\nThese provisions affect the replacement of the boroughs, Towns and urban districts which existed before then. Similar reforms in the nomenclature of local authorities ( but not their functions) are effected by section 11 part 17 of the act includes provision (section 185(2))\n''Qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census or such other figure as the Minister may from time to time prescribe by regulations, and not having a [[town council]], may make a proposal in accordance with paragraph (b) for the establishment of such a council''\nand contains provisions enabling the establishment of new town councils and provisions enabling the dissolution of existing or new town councils in certain circumstances\n\nThe reference to ''town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census'' hands much of the power relating to defining what is in fact a town over to the Central Statistics Office and their criteria are published as part of each census.\n\n;Planning and Development Act 2000\nAnother reference to the Census and its role in determining what is or is not a town for some administrative purpose is in the Planning and Development act 2000 (part II chapter I which provides for Local area plans)\n\n''A local area plan shall be made in respect of an area which \u2014(i) is designated as a town in the most recent census of population, other than a town designated as a suburb or environs in that census, (ii) has a population in excess of 2,000, and (iii) is situated within the functional area of a planning authority which is a county council.''\n\n;Central Statistics Office criteria\nThese are set out in full at [http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census_2006_Appendices.pdf 2006 Census Appendices].\n\nIn short they speak of \"towns with legally defined boundaries\" ( i.e. those established by the Local Government Act 2001) and the remaining 664 as \"census towns\", defined by themselves since 1971 as ''a cluster of 50 or more occupied dwellings in which within a distance of 800 meters there is a nucleus of 30 occupied houses on both sides of the road or twenty occupied houses on one side of the road'' there is also a ''200 meter criterion'' for determining whether a house is part of a census town.\n\n=== India ===\n[[File:One of the high streets in Paravur.jpg|right|thumb|A street in [[Paravur, Kollam|Paravur]] town, India]]\nThe [[2011 Census of India]] defines towns of two types: statutory town and [[census town]]. Statutory town is defined as all places with a [[municipality]], [[Municipal corporation|corporation]], [[Cantonment Board|cantonment board]] or notified town area committee. Census towns are defined as places that satisfy the following criteria:\n# Minimum population of 5,000\n# At least 75% of male working population engaged in non-agricultural pursuits\n# Density of population at least 400/km<sup>2</sup>. (1,000 per sq. mile).\n\nAll the statutory towns, census towns and [[out growth]]s are considered as urban settlements, as opposed to rural areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Some Concepts and Definitions|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/kerala/13-concept-34.pdf|publisher=Census of India|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Iran ===\nIn contemporary [[Persian language|Persian]] texts, no distinction is made between \"city\" and \"town\"; both translate as \"Shahr\" (\u0634\u0647\u0631). In older Persian texts (until the first half of the 20th century), the Arabic word \"Qasabeh\" (\u0642\u0635\u0628\u0647) was used for a town. However, in recent 50 years, this word has become obsolete.\n\nThere is a word in Persian which is used for special sort of satellite townships and city neighborhoods. It is ''Shahrak'' (\u0634\u0647\u0631\u06a9), (lit.: small city).\nAnother smaller type of town or [[neighborhood]] in a big city is called ''Kuy'' (\u06a9\u0648\u06cc). ''Shahrak'' and ''Kuy'' each have their different legal definitions.\nLarge cities such as [[Tehran]], [[Mashhad]], [[Isfahan]], [[Tabriz]], etc. which have millions of populations are referred to as ''Kalan-shahr''\u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0646\u200c\u0634\u0647\u0631 ([[metropole]]).\n\nThe pace in which different large villages have gained city status in [[Iran]] shows a dramatic increase in the last two decades.\n\nBigger cities and towns usually are centers of a [[township]] (in Persian: ''Shahrestan'' (\u0634\u0647\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646). Shahrestan itself is a subdivision of ''Ostan'' \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 (Province).\n\n===Isle of Man===\nThere are four settlements which are historically and officially designated as towns (Douglas, Ramsey, Peel, Castletown); however\n\n* Peel is also sometimes referred to as a city by virtue of its cathedral.\n* Onchan and Port Erin are both larger in population than the smallest \"town\", having expanded in modern times, but are designated as villages.\n\n=== Israel ===\n[[Modern Hebrew]] does provide a word for the concept of a town: ''Ayara'' (\u05e2\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4),  derived from ''Ir'' (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8), the biblical word for \"city\". However, the term ''ayara'' is normally used only to describe towns in foreign countries, i.e. urban areas of limited population, particularly when the speaker is attempting to evoke nostalgic or romantic attitudes. The term is also used to describe a [[Shtetl]], a pre-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] [[Eastern Europe]]an Jewish town.\n\nWithin Israel, established urban areas are always referred to as cities (with one notable exception explained below) regardless of their actual size. Israeli law does not define any nomenclature for distinction between urban areas based on size or any other factor \u2013 meaning that all urban settlements in Israel are legally referred to as \"cities\".\n\nThe exception to the above is the term ''Ayeret Pituakh'' (\u05e2\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05ea \u05e4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5\u05d7, lit. \"Development Town\") which is applied to certain cities in Israel based on the reasons for their establishment. These cities, created during the earlier decades of Israeli independence (1950s and 1960s, generally), were designed primarily to serve as commercial and transportation hubs, connecting smaller agricultural settlements in the northern and southern regions of the country (the \"Periphery\") to the major urban areas of the coastal and central regions. Some of these \"development towns\" have since grown to a comparatively large size, and yet are still referred to as \"development towns\", particularly when the speaker wishes to emphasize their (often low) socio-economic status. Nonetheless, they are rarely (if ever) referred to simply as \"towns\"; when referring to one directly, it will be called either a \"development town\" or a \"city\", depending on context.\n\n=== Italy ===\nAlthough Italian provides different words for city (''citt\u00e0''), town (''paese'') and village (''villaggio'', old-fashioned, or ''[[frazione]]'', most common), no legal definitions exist as to how settlements must be classified. Administratively, both towns and cities are ruled as [[comuni]]/[[comune]]s, while villages might be subdivisions of the former. \nGenerally, in everyday's speech, a town is larger or more populated than a village and smaller than a city. Various cities and towns together may form a metropolitan area (''area metropolitana''). A city, can also be a culturally, economically or politically prominent community with respect to surrounding towns. Moreover, a city can be such by [[President of Italy|Presidential]] decree. A town, in contrast, can be an inhabited place which would elsewhere be styled a city, but has not received any official recognition.\nRemarkable exceptions do exist: for instance, [[Bassano del Grappa]], was given the status of \"citt\u00e0\" in 1760 by [[Francesco Loredan]]'s [[Doge|dogal]] decree and has since then carried this title. Also, the Italian word for town (''paese'' with lowercase P) must not be confused with the Italian word for country/nation (''Paese'' usually with uppercase P).\n\n=== Japan ===\nIn Japan city status (''[[Cities of Japan|shi]]'') was traditionally reserved for only a few particularly large settlements. Over time however the necessary conditions to be a city have been watered down and today the only loose rules that apply are having a population over 50,000 and over 60% of the population in a \"city centre\". In recent times many small villages and towns have merged in order to form a city despite seeming geographically to be just a collection of villages.\n\nThe distinction between towns (''[[Towns of Japan|machi/ch\u014d]]'') and villages (''[[Villages of Japan|mura/son]]'') is largely unwritten and purely one of population size when the settlement was founded with villages having under 10,000 and towns 10,000\u201350,000.\n\n=== Korea ===\n{{main|Eup (administrative division)}}\nIn both of South Korea and North Korea, towns are called ''[[Eup (administrative division)|eup]]'' (''\uc74d'').\n\n=== Latvia ===\nIn [[Latvia]], towns and cities are indiscriminately called ''pils\u0113ta'' in singular form. The name is a [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of two Latvian words: ''pils'' (castle) and ''s\u0113ta'' (fence), making it very obvious what is meant by the word \u2013 what is situated between the castle and the castle fence. However, a city can be called ''lielpils\u0113ta'' in reference to its size. A village is called ''ciemats'' or ''ciems'' in Latvian.\n\n=== Lithuania ===\n{{main|List of towns in Lithuania}}\nIn [[Lithuania]]n,  a city is called ''[[:lt:miestas|miestas]]'', a town is called ''[[:lt:miestelis|miestelis]]'' (literally \"small ''miestas''). [[Metropolis]] is called ''[[:lt:didmiestis|didmiestis]]'' (literally \"big ''miestas'').\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nIn [[Malaysia]], a town is the area administered by Municipal Council ({{lang-ms|1=Majlis Perbandaran}}).\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nBefore 1848 there was a legal distinction between ''stad'' and non-''stad'' parts of the country, but the word no longer has any legal significance. About 220 places were granted ''stadsrechten'' (city rights) and are still so called for historical and traditional reasons, though the word is also used for large urban areas that never obtained such rights. Because of this, in the [[Netherlands]], no distinction is made between \"city\" and \"town\"; both translate as ''stad''. A hamlet (''gehucht'') usually has fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, a village (''dorp'') ranges from 1,000 up to 25,000 inhabitants, and a place above 25,000 can call itself either village or city, mostly depending on historic reasons or size of the place. As an example, [[The Hague]] never gained city rights, but because of its size - more than half a million inhabitants - it is regarded as a city. [[Staverden]], with only 40 inhabitants, would be a hamlet, but because of its city rights it may call itself a city.\n\nFor statistical purposes, the Netherlands has three sorts of cities:\n* ''kleine stad'' (small city): 50,000 \u2014 99,999 inhabitants\n* ''middelgrote stad'' (medium-sized city): 100,000 \u2014 249,999 inhabitants\n* ''grote stad'' (large city): 250,000 or more\n\nOnly [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Utrecht]] are regarded as a ''grote stad''.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIn [[New Zealand]], a town is a built-up area that is not large enough to be considered a city. Historically, this definition corresponded to a population of between approximately 1,000 and 20,000. Towns have no independent legal existence, being administered simply as built-up parts of districts, or, in some cases, of cities.\n\nNew Zealand's towns vary greatly in size and importance, ranging from small rural service centres to significant regional centres such as [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] and [[Taupo]]. Typically, once a town reaches a population of somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 people, it will begin to be informally regarded as a city. One who regards a settlement as too small to be a town will typically call it a \"township\" or \"village.\"\n\n=== Norway ===\nIn [[Norway]], \"city\" and \"town\" both translate to \"[[By (city or town)|by]]\", even if a city may be referred to as \"storby\" (\"large town\"). They will all be part of and administered as a \"[[Municipalities of Norway|kommune]]\" (\"[[municipality]]\").\n\nNorway has had inland the northernmost city in the world: Hammerfest. Now the record is held by New \u00c5lesund on the Norwegian island Svalbard\n\n=== Philippines ===\n[[File:Loboc Bohol 1.jpg|thumb|The town center of [[Loboc, Bohol]].]]\n{{Main|List of cities and municipalities in the Philippines|Municipalities of the Philippines}}\nIn the [[Philippines]], the local official equivalent of the town is the [[Philippine municipality|municipality]] (Filipino ''bayan''). Every municipality, or town, in the country has a mayor (Filipino ''alkalde'') and a vice mayor (Filipino ''bise alkalde'') as well as local town officials ([[Sangguniang Bayan]]). Philippine towns, otherwise called as municipalities, are composed of a number of villages and communities called ''[[barangays]]'' with one (or a few cluster of) ''barangay''(s) serving as the town center or ''[[poblacion]]''.\n\nUnique in Philippine towns is that they have fixed budget, population and land requirements to become as such, i.e. from a ''barangay'', or a cluster of such, to a town, or to become cities, i.e. from town to a city. Respectively, examples of these are the town of [[Braulio E. Dujali, Davao del Norte|B.E. Dujali]] in [[Davao del Norte]] province, which was formed in 1998 from a cluster of 5 ''barangays'', and the city of [[El Salvador, Misamis Oriental|El Salvador]], which was converted from a town to a city in 2007. Each town in the Philippines was classified by its [[Municipalities of the Philippines#Income classification|annual income and budget]].\n\nA sharp, hierarchical distinction exists between Philippine [[Philippine city|cities]] (Filipino ''lungsod'' or ''siyudad'') and towns, as towns in the country are juridically separate from cities, which are typically larger and more populous (some smaller and less populated) and which political and economic status are above those of towns. This was further supported and indicated by the income classification system implemented by the National Department of Finance, to which both cities and towns fell into their respective categories that indicate they are such as stated under Philippine law. However, both towns and cities equally share the status as [[Administrative divisions of the Philippines#Local government units|local government units]] (LGU's) grouped under and belong to [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] and [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]]; both each are composed of ''barangays'' and are governed by a mayor and a vice mayor supplemented by their respective LGU legislative councils.\n\n=== Poland ===\n[[File:Zamo\u015b\u0107. Ratusz..jpg|thumb|right|[[Zamo\u015b\u0107]] in [[Poland]] is an example of a [[utopia]]n [[ideal town]]. It was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1992]]\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Poland}}\n\nSimilarly to Germany and Sweden, in [[Poland]] there is no linguistic distinction between a city and a town. The word for both is ''miasto'', as a form of settlement distinct from following: village (wie\u015b), hamlet (przysi\u00f3\u0142ek), settlement (osada), or colony (kolonia). Town status is conferred by administrative decree, new towns are announced by the Government in a separate Bill effective from the first day of the year. Some settlements tend to remain villages even though they have a larger population than many smaller towns. Town may be called in diminutive way as \"miasteczko\", what is colloquially used for localities with a few thousand residents. Such localities have usually a '''Mayor''' (burmistrz) as a chief of town council.\n\nCities are the biggest localities, generally must be bigger than 100 thousand of residents, they are ruled by '''President''' (prezydent) as a chief of City Council. There are bare a few (mainly historic or political) exemptions which have allowed towns lesser than 100 thousand of people, to obtain President title for their Mayors, and to become recognized as Cities that way. Just to name a few: [[Boles\u0142awiec]], [[Gniezno]], [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]].\n\n=== Portugal ===\nLike other Iberian cultures, in [[Portugal]] there is a traditional distinction between towns (''[[:pt:Vila|vilas]]'') and cities (''[[:pt:Cidade|cidades]]''). Similarly, although these areas are not defined under the constitution, and have no political function (with associated organs), they are defined by law,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.povt.qren.pt/tempfiles/20080213151143moptc.pdf |title=Law n.\u00ba 11/82 (Lei das designa\u00e7\u00f5es e determina\u00e7\u00e3o de categoria das povoa\u00e7\u00f5es), of June, 2nd |accessdate=2010-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100608050009/http%3A//www.povt.qren.pt/tempfiles/20080213151143moptc.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-08 }}</ref> and a town must have:\n* at least 3,000 inhabitants\n* at least half of these services: health unit, pharmacy, cultural centre, public transportation network, post office, commercial food and drinking establishments, primary school and/or bank office\nIn this context, the town or city is subordinate to the local authority ([[freguesia|civil parish]] or [[concelho|municipality]], in comparison to the North American context, where they have political functions. In special cases, some [[village]]s may be granted the status of town if they possess historical, cultural or architectonic importance.\n\nThe Portuguese urban settlements [[heraldry]] reflects the difference between towns and cities,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/pt-_m.html#rules |website=Flags of the World|title = Portuguese municipal flags |publisher= Crwflags.com |accessdate=}}</ref> with the [[coat of arms]] of a town bearing a crown with 4 towers, while the coat of arms of a city bears a crown with 5 towers. This difference between towns and cities is still in use in other Portuguese speaking countries, but in Brazil is no longer in use.\n\n=== Romania ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Romania}}\n\nIn [[Romania]] there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is: ''ora\u015f''). Cities and towns in Romania can have the status either of ''ora\u015f'' [[municipiu]], conferred to large urban areas, or only ''ora\u015f'' to smaller urban localities. Some settlements remain villages ([[Communes of Romania|communes]]) even though they have a larger population than other smaller towns.\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Main|Types of inhabited localities in Russia}}\n\n[[File:moscow reutov.jpg|thumb|The town of [[Reutov]] is separated from the city of [[Moscow]] just by the [[Moscow Ring Road|MKAD]] highway]]\n\nUnlike [[English language|English]], the [[Russian language]] does not distinguish the terms \"city\" and \"town\"\u2014both are translated as \"{{lang|ru|\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434}}\" (''gorod'').  Occasionally the term \"{{lang|ru|\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434}}\" is applied to [[urban-type settlement]]s as well, even though the status of those is not the same as that of a city/town proper.\n\nIn Russia, the criteria an inhabited locality needs to meet in order to be granted city/town (''gorod'') status vary in different [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]]. In general, to qualify for this status, an inhabited locality should have more than 12,000 inhabitants and the occupation of no less than 85% of inhabitants must be other than agriculture. However, inhabited localities which were previously granted the city/town status but no longer meet the criteria can still retain the status for historical reasons.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{main|New towns of Singapore}}\nIn Singapore, towns are large scale satellite housing developments which are designed to be self contained.

A \"town\" is a settlement that has a size that is smaller than that of a city.\n\n=== Spain ===\nIn [[Spain]], the equivalent of town would be ''villa,'' a population unit between a village (''pueblo)'' and a city ''(ciudad)'', and is not defined by the number of inhabitants, but by some historical rights and privileges dating from the Middle Ages, such as the right to hold a market or fair. For instance, while [[Madrid]] is technically a ''villa'', [[Barcelona]], with a smaller population, is known as a city.\n\n=== Sweden ===\n[[File:\u00d6vre Finngr\u00e4nd 7 Sta Maria 29 Visby Gotland.jpg|thumbnail|View towards [[Visby Cathedral|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Visby]], [[Sweden]].

The term ''t\u00e4tort'' is used for an [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]] or a locality, which however is a statistical rather than an administrative concept and encompasses densely settled villages with only 200 inhabitants as well as the major cities. The word ''[[k\u00f6ping]]'' corresponds to an English ''[[market town]]'' ''(chipping)'' or German ''[[wikt:Markt|Markt]]'' but is mainly of historical significance, as the term is not used today and only survives in some [[toponym]]s. Some towns with names ending in ''-k\u00f6ping'' are cities with over 100 000 inhabitants today, e.g. [[Link\u00f6ping]].\n\nBefore 1971, 132 larger [[Municipality|municipalities]] in [[Sweden]] enjoyed special royal charters as ''[[Stad (Sweden)|stad]]'' instead of ''[[kommun]]'' (which is similar to a US [[County (United States)|county]]). However, since 1971 all municipalities are officially defined as ''kommun'', thus making no legal difference between, for instance, [[Stockholm]] and a small countryside municipality. Every urban area that was a ''stad'' before 1971 is still often referred to as a ''stad'' in daily speech. Since the 1980s, 14 of these municipalities brand themselves as ''stad'' again, although this has no legal or administrative significance, as they still have refer to themselves as ''kommun'' in all legal documentation.\n\nFor statistical purposes, [[Statistics Sweden]] officially defines a ''stad'' as an [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]] of at least 10,000 inhabitants. In the [[Swedish language]] the term for a major city is ''storstad'' (literally \"big town\"), but there is no clear definition as to when a ''stad'' should be called a ''storstad''. Most Swedes would only call [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malm\u00f6]] ''storst\u00e4der'', i.e. \"major cities\", although [[Uppsala]] fulfills the definition of \"municipality with a population that exceeds 200 000 inhabitants\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/statistik/BE/LE0102/2002A01/LE0102_2002A01_BR_12_BE51ST0307.pdf |title=Bilaga 1.

Public electronic dictionary of Ukrainian language (ukrlit.org)</ref> Historically, town in the Ukrainian lands was a smaller populated place that was chartered under the [[German town law]] and had a market square (see [[Market town]]). \nToday informally, town is also referred to [[City of district significance (Ukraine)|cities of district significance]], cities with small population, and former Jewish [[shtetl]]s.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{Main|City status in the United Kingdom}}\n\n==== England and Wales ====\n{{Main|List of urban areas in England by population|list of urban areas in Wales by population}}\n\n[[File:Rugby town centre.jpg|thumb|left|A traditional English town centre at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]]]\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]], a town traditionally was a settlement which had a charter to hold a [[Market (place)|market]] or [[fair]] and therefore became a \"[[market town]]\". Market towns were distinguished from villages in that they were the economic hub of a surrounding area, and were usually larger and had more facilities.\n\nIn parallel with popular usage, however, there are many technical and official definitions of what constitutes a town, to which various interested parties cling.\n\nIn modern official usage the term ''town'' is employed either for old market towns, or for settlements which have a [[town council]], or for settlements which elsewhere would be classed a city, but which do not have [[City status in the United Kingdom|the legal right]] to call themselves such. Any parish council can decide to describe itself as a town council, but this will usually only apply to the smallest \"towns\" (because larger towns will be larger than a single civil parish).\n\nNot all settlements which are commonly described as towns have a \"Town Council\" or \"Borough Council\". In fact, because of many successive changes to the structure of local government, there are now few large towns which are represented by a body closely related to their historic borough council. These days, a smaller town will usually be part of a local authority which covers several towns. And where a larger town '''is''' the seat of a local authority, the authority will usually cover a much wider area than the town itself (either a large rural hinterland, or several other, smaller towns).\n\nAdditionally, there are \"[[new town]]s\" which were created during the 20th century, such as [[Basildon]], [[Redditch]] and [[Telford]]. [[Milton Keynes]] was designed to be a \"new city\" but legally it is still a town despite its size.\n\nSome settlements which describe themselves as towns (e.g. [[Shipston-on-Stour]], [[Warwickshire]]) are smaller than some large villages (e.g. [[Kidlington]], [[Oxfordshire]]).\n\nThe status of a ''city'' is reserved for places that have [[letters patent]] entitling them to the name, historically associated with the possession of a cathedral. Some large municipalities (such as [[Northampton]] and [[Bournemouth]]) are legally [[borough]]s but not cities, whereas some cities are quite small \u2014 such as [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] or [[St David's]]. The city of [[Brighton and Hove]] was created from the two former towns and some surrounding villages, and within the city the correct term for the former distinct entities is somewhat unclear.\n\n[[File:Windhill.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop's Stortford]]]]\n\nIt appears that a city may become a town, though perhaps only through administrative error: [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in Kent had been a city for centuries but, when in 1998 the [[Medway]] district was created, a bureaucratic blunder meant that Rochester lost its official [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] and is now technically a town.\n\nIt is often thought that towns with [[cathedral|bishops' seats]] rank automatically as cities: however, [[Chelmsford]] was a town until 5 June 2012 despite being the seat of the [[diocese of Chelmsford]], created in 1914. [[St Asaph]], which is the seat of the [[diocese of St Asaph]], only became a city on 1 June 2012 though the diocese was founded in the mid sixth century. In reality, the pre-qualification of having a cathedral of the established [[Church of England]], and the formerly established [[Church in Wales]] or [[Church of Ireland]], ceased to apply from 1888.\n\nThe word ''town'' can also be used as a general term for urban areas, including cities and in a few cases, districts within cities. In this usage, a city is a type of town; a large one, with a certain status. For example, central [[Greater London]] is sometimes referred to colloquially as \"London town\". (The \"[[City of London]]\" is the historical nucleus, informally known as the \"Square Mile\", and is administratively separate from the rest of Greater London, while the [[City of Westminster]] is also technically a city and is also a [[London borough]].) [[Camden Town]] and [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] are districts of London, as [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] is a district of [[Edinburgh]] \u2013 actually the Georgian centre.\n\nIn recent years the division between cities and towns has grown, leading to the establishment of groups like the Centre for Towns, who work to highlight the issues facing many towns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.centrefortowns.org/about-us|title=About Us|last=Design|first=Concom Website|website=Centre For Towns|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> Towns also became a significant issue in the [[2020 Labour Party leadership election]], with [[Lisa Nandy]] making significant reference to Labour needing to win back smaller towns which have swung away from the party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/economy/house/house-magazine/107129/lisa-nandy-mp-britains-towns-are-short-changed-cities|title=Lisa Nandy MP: Britain\u2019s towns are short-changed as cities capture an ever-greater share of foreign investment|last=PoliticsHome.com|date=2019-10-08|website=PoliticsHome.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==== Scotland ====\n{{Main|List of burghs in Scotland|List of towns and cities in Scotland by population}}\n\nA ''town'' in [[Scotland]] has no specific legal meaning and (especially in areas which were or are still [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking) can refer to a mere collection of buildings (e.g. a ''farm-town'' or in [[Scots language|Scots]] ''ferm-toun''), not all of which might be inhabited, or to an inhabited area of any size which is not otherwise described in terms such as [[city]], [[burgh]], etc. Many locations of greatly different size will be encountered with a name ending with ''-town'', ''-ton'', ''-toun'' etc. (or beginning with the Gaelic equivalent ''baile'' etc.).\n\nA [[burgh]] (pronounced ''burruh'') is the [[Scots language|Scots']] term for a town or a municipality. They were highly [[Autonomous area|autonomous]] units of [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] from at least the 12th century until their abolition in 1975, when a new [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|regional structure of local government]] was introduced across the country. Usually based upon a town, they had a [[municipal corporation]] and certain rights, such as a degree of [[self-governance]] and representation in the sovereign [[Parliament of Scotland]] adjourned in 1707.\n\nThe term no longer describes units of local government although various claims are made from time to time that the legislation used was not competent to change the status of the Royal Burghs described below. The status is now chiefly ceremonial but various functions have been inherited by current Councils (e.g. the application of various endowments providing for public benefit) which might only apply within the area previously served by a burgh; in consequence a burgh can still exist (if only as a defined geographical area) and might still be signed as such by the current local authority. The word 'burgh' is generally not used as a synonym for 'town' or 'city' in everyday speech, but is reserved mostly for government and administrative purposes.\n\nHistorically, the most important burghs were [[royal burgh]]s, followed by [[burgh of regality|burghs of regality]] and [[burgh of barony|burghs of barony]]. Some newer settlements were only designated as [[police burgh]]s from the 19th century onward, a classification which also applies to most of the older burghs.\n\n=== United States ===\n[[File:Wyatt-indiana-from-above.jpg|thumb|The tiny farming community of [[Wyatt, Indiana]]]]\n\nThe definition of \"town\" varies widely from state to state and in many states there is no official definition. In some states, the term \"town\" refers to an area of population distinct from others in some meaningful dimension, typically population or type of government. The characteristic that distinguishes a town from another type of populated place &mdash; a city, borough, village, or [[Civil township|township]], for example &mdash; differs from state to state. In some states, a town is an incorporated [[municipality]]; that is, one with a [[charter]] received from the state, similar to a city (see [[incorporated town]]), while in others, a town is unincorporated. In some instances, the term \"town\" refers to a small incorporated municipality of less than a population threshold specified by state statute, while in others a town can be significantly larger. Some states do not use the term \"town\" at all, while in others the term has no official meaning and is used informally to refer to a populated place, of any size, whether incorporated or unincorporated. In still other states, the words \"town\" and \"city\" are legally interchangeable.\n\nSmall town life has been a major theme in American literature, especially stories of rejection by young people leaving for the metropolis.<ref>Miles Orvell, ''The Death and Life of Main Street: Small Towns in American Memory, Space, and Community'' (University of North Carolina Press; 2012)</ref>\n\nSince the use of the term varies considerably by state, individual usages are presented in the following sections:\n\n====Alabama====\nIn [[Alabama]], the legal use of the terms \"town\" and \"city\" is based on population.  A municipality with a population of 2,000 or more is a city, while less than 2,000 is a town (Code of Alabama 1975, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130616104014/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/11-40-6.htm Section 11-40-6]).  For legislative purposes, municipalities are divided into eight classes based on population.  Class 8 includes all towns, plus cities with populations of less than 6,000 (Code of Alabama 1975, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130616104906/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/11-40-12.htm Section 11-40-12]).\n\n====Arizona====\n\nIn [[Arizona]], the terms \"town\" and \"city\" are largely interchangeable. A community may incorporate under either a town or a city organization with no regard to population or other restrictions according to Arizona law (see Arizona Revised Statutes, Title 9). Cities may function under slightly differing governmental systems, such as the option to organize a district system for city governments, but largely retain the same powers as towns. Arizona law also allows for the consolidation of neighboring towns and the unification of a city and a town, but makes no provision for the joining of two adjacent cities.\n\n====California====\nIn [[California]], the words \"town\" and \"city\" are synonymous by law (see Cal. Govt. Code Secs. 34500\u201334504). There are two types of cities in California: charter and general law. Cities organized as charter cities derive their authority from a [[municipal charter|charter]] that they draft and file with the state, and which, among other things, states the municipality's name as \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name).\" Government Code Sections 34500\u201334504 applies to cities organized as [[general-law municipality|general law cities]], which differ from charter cities in that they do not have charters but instead operate with the powers conferred them by the pertinent sections of the Government Code. Like charter cities, general law cities may incorporate as \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name).\"\n\nSome cities change their minds as to how they want to be called. The sign in front of the municipal offices in [[Los Gatos, California]], for example, reads \"City of Los Gatos\", but the words engraved on the building above the front entrance when the city hall was built read \"Town of Los Gatos.\" There are also signs at the municipal corporation limit, some of which welcome visitors to the \"City of Los Gatos\" while older, adjacent signs welcome people to the \"Town of Los Gatos.\" Meanwhile, the village does not exist in California as a municipal corporation. Instead, the word \"town\" is commonly used to indicate any unincorporated community that might otherwise be known as an unincorporated village. Additionally, some people may still use the word \"town\" as shorthand for \"township\", which is not an incorporated municipality but an administrative division of a county.\n\n====Hawaii====\n\nThe [[Hawaii]]an Island of [[Oahu]] has various communities that may be referred to as towns. However, the entire island is lumped as a single incorporated city, the City and County of [[Honolulu]]. The towns on Oahu are merely unincorporated [[census-designated place]]s.\n\n====Illinois====\nIn [[Illinois]], the word \"town\" has been used both to denote a subdivision of a county called a township,<ref>See the Township Code, 60 ILCS 1 et seq.</ref> and to denote a form of municipality similar to a [[village]], in that it is generally governed by a president and trustees rather than a mayor.<ref>See ''Phillips v. Town of Scales Mound'', 195 Ill. 353, 357, 63 N.E. 180 (1902)</ref> In some areas a \"Town\" may be incorporated legally as a Village (meaning it has at large Trustees) or a City (meaning it has aldermen from districts) and absorb the duties of the Township it is coterminous with (maintenance of birth records, certain welfare items). [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]] and [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]] are examples of Towns in this manner. Under the current Illinois Municipal Code, an incorporated or unincorporated town may choose to incorporate as a city or as a village, but other forms of incorporation are no longer allowed.<ref>''See generally'' Article 2 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/2\u20111\u20111 et seq.</ref>\n\n====Louisiana====\nIn [[Louisiana]] a \"town\" is defined as being a municipal government having a population of 1,001 to 4,999 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/gc021x2.pdf |title=Individual State Descriptions: 2002 |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref>\n\n====Maryland====\n\nWhile a \"town\" is generally considered a smaller entity than a \"city\", the two terms are legally interchangeable in Maryland.  The only exception may be the [[independent city]] of [[Baltimore]], which is a special case, as it was created by the [[Constitution of Maryland]].\n\n====Nevada====\n\nIn [[Nevada]], a town has a form of government, but is not considered to be incorporated. It generally provides a limited range of services, such as [[land use planning]] and recreation, while leaving most services to the county. Many communities have found this \"semi-incorporated\" status attractive; the state has only 20 incorporated [[List of cities in Nevada|cities]], and towns as large as [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] (186,020 in 2000 Census), home of the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Most [[county seat]]s are also towns, not cities.\n\n====New England====\n{{Main|New England town}}\n\nIn the six [[New England]] states, a [[New England town|town]] is a municipality and a more important unit than the [[county]]. In [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]] and 7 out of 14 counties in [[Massachusetts]], in fact, counties only exist as map divisions and have no legal functions; in the other three states, counties are primarily judicial districts, with other functions primarily in [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]], and [[Vermont]]. In all six, towns perform functions that in most states would be county functions. The defining feature of a New England town, as opposed to a city, is that a [[town meeting]] and a [[board of selectmen]] serve as the main form of government for a town, while cities are run by a mayor and a city council. For example, [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] is a town, even though it is fairly urban, because of its form of government.\n\n====New Jersey====\n{{Main|Town (New Jersey)}}\n\nA \"town\" in the context of New Jersey local government refers to one of five types and one of eleven forms of municipal government. While Town is often used as a shorthand to refer to a Township, the two are not the same. The Town Act of 1895 allowed any municipality or area with a population exceeding 5,000 to become a Town through a petition and referendum process. Under the 1895 Act, a newly incorporated town was divided into at least three wards, with two councilmen per ward serving staggered two-year terms, and one councilman at large, who also served a two-year term. The councilman at large served as chairman of the town council. The Town Act of 1988 completely revised the Town form of government and applied to all towns incorporated under the Town Act of 1895 and to those incorporated by a special charter granted by the Legislature prior to 1875.\n\nUnder the 1988 Act, the mayor is also the councilman at large, serving a term of two years, unless increased to three years by a petition and referendum process. The Council under the Town Act of 1988 consists of eight members serving staggered two-year terms with two elected from each of four wards. One councilman from each ward is up for election each year. Towns with different structures predating the 1988 Act may retain those features unless changed by a petition and referendum process. Two new provisions were added in 1991 to the statutes governing towns, First, a petition and referendum process was created whereby the voters can require that the mayor and town council be elected to four-year terms of office. The second new provision defines the election procedure in towns with wards. The mayor in a town chairs the town council and heads the municipal government. The mayor may both vote on legislation before council and veto ordinances. A veto may be overridden by a vote of two-thirds of all the members of the council. The council may enact an ordinance to delegate all or a portion of the executive responsibilities of the town to a municipal administrator. Fifteen New Jersey municipalities currently have a type of Town, nine of which operate under the town form of government.\n\n====New York====\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of New York#Town}}\nIn [[Administrative divisions of New York|New York]], a town is similarly a division of the county, but with less importance than in New England. Of some importance, a town provides a closer level of governance than its enclosing county, providing almost all municipal services to unincorporated communities, called [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlets]], and selected services to incorporated areas, called [[Village (New York)|villages]]. In New York, a town typically contains a number of such hamlets and villages. However, due to their independent nature, incorporated villages may exist in two towns or even two counties (example: [[Almond (village), New York]]). Everyone in New York who does not live on an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] reservation or a city lives in a town and possibly in one of the town's hamlets or villages. (There are no towns in the five counties \u2013 also known as [[Boroughs (New York City)|boroughs]] \u2013 that make up [[New York City]].)\n\n====North Carolina====\nIn [[North Carolina]], all cities, towns, and villages are incorporated as [[List of municipalities in North Carolina|municipalities]]. According to the North Carolina League of Municipalities,<ref>{{cite web|website = North Carolina League of Municipalities|title = How NC Cities Work|url = https://www.nclm.org/advocacy/how-nc-cities-work |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516211303/http://www.nclm.org/resource-center/Pages/How-Municipalities-Work.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-16 }}</ref> there is no legal distinction among a city, town, or village\u2014it is a matter of preference of the local government.  Some North Carolina cities have populations as small as 1,000 residents, while some towns, such as [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], have populations of greater than 100,000.\n\n====Oklahoma====\nAccording to the definitions in the Oklahoma Municipal Code, \"City\" means a municipality which has incorporated as a city in accordance with the laws of the state; \"Town\" means a municipality which has incorporated as a town in accordance with the laws of the state; and, a \"Municipality\" means any incorporated city or town.<ref name=\u201dOklahomaLaw1\u201d>{{cite web|url= https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=75748 |title= 11 O.S. 1-102 (Oklahoma Statutes, Title 11, Cities and Towns; Chapter 1, Oklahoma Municipal Code; Section 1-102, Definitions)|publisher=Oklahoma State Courts Network|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>  The term \u201cVillage\u201d is not defined or used in the act.<ref name=\u201dOklahomaLaw1\u201d />  Any community of people residing in compact form may become incorporated as a Town; however, if the resident population is one thousand or more, a Town or community of people residing in compact form may become incorporated as a City.<ref name=\u201dOklahomaLaw2\u201d>{{cite web|url= https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=75750|title= 11 O.S. 2-101 (Oklahoma Statutes, Title 11, Cities and Towns; Chapter 1, Oklahoma Municipal Code; Section 2-101, Incorporation of a Municipality)|publisher=Oklahoma State Courts Network|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Pennsylvania====\nIn [[Pennsylvania]], only one municipality is incorporated as a \"town\": [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania|Bloomsburg]]. Most of the rest of the state is incorporated as townships (there are also boroughs and cities), which function in much the same way as the towns of New York or New England, although they may have different forms of government.\n\n====Texas====\nIn [[Texas]], although some municipalities refer to themselves as \"towns\" or \"villages\" (to market themselves as an attractive place to live), these names have no specific designation in Texas law; legally all incorporated places are considered [[List of municipalities in Texas|cities]].\n\n====Utah====\n{{see also|List of cities and towns in Utah}}\nIn [[Utah]], the legal use of the terms \"town\" and \"city\" is based on population. A municipality with a population of 1,000 or more is a city, while less than 1,000 is a town. In addition, cities are divided into five separate classes based on population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm|title=Utah Code, Title 10, Chapter 2, Section 301|publisher=Utah State Legislature|accessdate=May 11, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808233054/http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm|archivedate=August 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Virginia====\n{{main|Administrative divisions of Virginia#Towns}}\nIn [[Virginia]], a town is an incorporated municipality similar to a city (though with a smaller required minimum population).  But while cities are by Virginia law independent of counties, towns are contained within counties.<ref>{{cite web  |author=[http://cfs.gmu.edu/bio/grymes_c.html Charles A.

Cities get a fixed allocation of state funding for building and maintaining those roads, while counties must compete with each other and other VDOT priorities for a substantial portion of their road budget. Cities have been granted more authorities, such as the right of city councils to issue bonds to build roads without a voter referendum (counties must get voter approval in a referendum before issuing road bonds)... In Virginia, towns have distinct boundaries, established by the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] or by courts guided by laws passed by the legislature. Towns are *not* independent from counties; residents of towns are still residents of the county in which the town is located. For example, residents of the four towns of [[Haymarket, Virginia|Haymarket]], [[Quantico, Virginia|Quantico]], [[Dumfries, Virginia|Dumfries]], and [[Occoquan, Virginia|Occoquan]] are also residents of [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]]. They pay both town and county property taxes, and town residents get to vote for a town council/mayor.  |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620092601/http://virginiaplaces.org/vagupnova/countytowncity.html  |archivedate=2010-06-20  }}</ref>\n\n====Washington====\n{{Further|City government in Washington (state)}}\nA town in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] is a municipality that has a population of less than 1,500 at incorporation, however an existing town can reorganize as a code city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/governance/locgov31.aspx |title=Classification of Washington Cities |publisher=Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington |accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref> Town government authority is limited relative to [[city (Washington)|cities]], the other main classification of municipalities in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/management/forms/townandcodecity.aspx |title=A Comparison of the Powers of a Town and a Noncharter Code City |publisher=Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington |accessdate=December 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725204227/http://www.mrsc.org/Subjects/Management/forms/townandcodecity.aspx |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> {{As of|2012}}, most municipalities in Washington are cities.

Towns are generally larger than [[village]]s but smaller than [[city|cities]], though the criteria to distinguish them vary considerably between different parts of the world.\n\n== Origin and use ==\nThe word \"town\" shares an origin with the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|Zaun}}, the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word {{lang|nl|tuin}}, and the [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|tun}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/town|title=Town|publisher=Dictionary.com}}</ref> The original [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] word, *''tunan'', is thought to be an early borrowing from [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] *''dunon'' (cf. [[Old Irish]] {{lang|sga|dun}}, [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|din}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/town|title=Town|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>\n\nThe original sense of the word in both Germanic and Celtic was that of a fortress or an enclosure. Cognates of \"town\" in many modern Germanic languages designate a fence or a hedge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/town|title=Town|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> In English and Dutch, the meaning of the word took on the sense of the space which these fences enclosed, and through which a track must run.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In England, a town was a small community that could not afford or was not allowed to build walls or other larger fortifications, and built a [[palisade]] or stockade instead.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In the Netherlands, this space was a garden, more specifically those of the wealthy, which had a high fence or a wall around them (like the garden of the palace of [[Het Loo Palace|Het Loo]] in [[Apeldoorn]], which was the model for the privy garden of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] at [[Hampton Court]]). In Old Norse {{lang|non|tun}} means a (grassy) place between farmhouses, and the word is still used with a similar meaning in modern Norwegian.\n\nOld English ''tun'' became a common place-name suffix in England and southeastern Scotland during the Anglo-Saxon settlement period. In [[Old English]] and Early and Middle [[Scots language|Scots]], the words ''ton'', ''toun'', etc. could refer to diverse kinds of settlements from agricultural estates and holdings, partly picking up the Norse sense (as in the Scots word {{lang|sco|[[fermtoun]]}}) at one end of the scale, to fortified municipalities.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Other common Anglo-Saxon suffixes included ''ham'' (\"home\"), ''stede'' (\"stead\"), and ''burh'' (\"bury,\" \"borough,\" \"burgh\").\n\nIn some cases, \"town\" is an alternative name for \"city\" or \"village\" (especially a larger village). Sometimes, the word \"town\" is short for \"township\". In general, today towns can be differentiated from [[township]]s, [[village]]s, or [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s on the basis of their economic character, in that most of a town's population will tend to derive their living from manufacturing [[industry]], [[commerce]], and [[public service]]s rather than [[primary industry]] such as [[agriculture]] or related activities.\n\nA place's population size is not a reliable determinant of urban character. In many areas of the world, e.g. in [[India]] at least until recent times, a large village might contain several times as many people as a small town. In the [[United Kingdom]], there are historical cities [[List of urban areas in England by population|that are far smaller]] than the larger towns.\n\nThe modern phenomenon of extensive [[suburb]]an growth, satellite urban development, and migration of city dwellers to villages has further complicated the definition of towns, creating communities urban in their economic and cultural characteristics but lacking other characteristics of urban localities.\n\nSome forms of non-rural settlement, such as temporary [[mining]] locations, may be clearly non-rural, but have at best a questionable claim to be called a town.\n\nTowns often exist as distinct governmental units, with legally defined borders and some or all of the appurtenances of local government (e.g. a [[police]] force). In the United States these are referred to as \"incorporated towns\". In other cases the town lacks its own governance and is said to be \"unincorporated\". Note that the existence of an unincorporated town may be legally set out by other means, e.g. zoning districts. In the case of some [[planned community|planned communities]], the town exists legally in the form of covenants on the properties within the town. The [[United States Census]] identifies many [[census-designated place]]s (CDPs) by the names of unincorporated towns which lie within them; however, those CDPs typically include rural and suburban areas and even surrounding villages and other towns.\n\nThe distinction between a town and a city similarly depends on the approach: a city may strictly be an administrative entity which has been granted that designation by law, but in informal usage, the term is also used to denote an urban locality of a particular size or importance: whereas a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] city may have possessed as few as 10,000 inhabitants, today some{{who|date=November 2014}} consider an urban place of fewer than 100,000 as a town, even though there are many officially designated cities that are much smaller than that.\n\n== Age of towns scheme ==\n[[Australian]] geographer [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] proposed a classification of towns based on their age and pattern of [[land use]]. He identified five types of town:<ref>Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.</ref>\n\n* ''Infantile towns'', with no clear [[zoning]]\n* ''Juvenile towns'', which have developed an area of [[Retailing|shop]]s\n* ''Adolescent towns'', where [[factory|factories]] have started to appear\n* ''Early mature towns'', with a separate area of [[social class|high-class]] [[house|housing]]\n* ''Mature towns'', with defined [[industry|industrial]], [[commerce|commercial]] and various types of [[residential area]]\n\n== By country ==\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nIn [[Afghanistan]], towns and cities are known as ''sh\u0101r'' ([[Dari language|Dari]]: \u0634\u0647\u0631, [[Pashto]]: \u069a\u0627\u0631).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:687.raverty|title=A dictionary of the Puk'hto, Pus'hto, or language of the Afghans|website=dsalsrv0 2.uchicago.edu|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref> As the country is an historically rural society with few larger settlements, with major cities never holding more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants before the 2000s, the lingual tradition of the country does not discriminate between towns and cities.\n\n=== Albania ===\nIn [[Albania]] \"qytez\u00eb\" means town, which is very similar with the word for city (''\"qytet\"''). Although there is no official use of the term for any settlement. \nIn [[albanian language|Albanian]] \"qytez\u00eb\" means \"small city\" or \"new city\", while in ancient times \"small residential center within the walls of a castle\".\n\n=== Arab ===\nThe center is a population group, larger than a village, and smaller than a city. Though the village is bigger than a hamlet.\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn [[Australia]], most rural and regional centres of population can be called towns; many small towns have populations of less than 200.<ref>Australian Bureau of Statistics, \"Frequently Asked Questions\". https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Frequently+Asked+Questions#Anchor12 Retrieved 16 Oct 2019.</ref> The smallest may be described as townships.\n\nIn addition, some local government entities are officially styled as towns in [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]], and formerly also (till the 1990s) in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n=== Austria ===\n\nThe [[Austria]]n legal system does not distinguish between villages, towns, and cities. The country is partitioned into 2098 municipalities ({{lang-de|Gemeinden}}) of fundamentally equal rank. Larger municipalities are designated as market towns ({{lang-de|Marktgemeinden}}) or cities (''St\u00e4dte''), but these distinctions are purely symbolic and do not confer additional legal responsibilities. There is a number of smaller communities that are labelled cities because they used to be regional population centers in the distant past. The city of [[Rattenberg]] for example has about 400 inhabitants. The city of [[Hardegg]] has about 1200 inhabitants, although the historic city core \u2212 Hardegg proper without what used to be the surrounding hamlets \u2212 is home to just 80 souls.\n\nThere are no unincorporated areas.\n\nOf the 201 cities in Austria, 15 are [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory cities]] (''Statutarst\u00e4dte''). A statutory city is a city that is vested, in addition to its purview as a municipality, with the duties of a [[district (Austria)|district administrative authority]]. The status does not come with any additional autonomy: district administrative authorities are essentially just service centers that citizens use to interact with the national government, for example to apply for driver licenses or passports. The national government generally uses the provinces to run these points of contact on its behalf; in the case of statutory cities, the municipality gets to step up.\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Bulgaria}}\n\nBulgarians do not, in general, differentiate between 'city' and 'town'. However, in everyday language and media the terms \"large towns\" and \"small towns\" are in use. \"Large towns\" usually refers to [[Sofia]], [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and [[Burgas]], which have population over 200,000. [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] and [[Stara Zagora]] are often included as well due to presence of relatively developed infrastructure and population over 100,000 threshold. It is difficult to call the remaining [[Provinces of Bulgaria|provincial capitals]] \"large towns\" as, in general, they are less developed and have shrinking population, some with as few as 30,000 inhabitants.\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]] the [[Council of Ministers of Bulgaria|Council of Ministers]] defines what constitutes a settlement, while the [[President of Bulgaria]] grants each settlement its title. In 2005 the requirement that villages that wish to classify themselves as town must have a social and technical infrastructure, as well as a population of no fewer than 3500 people. For resort settlements the requirements are lower with the population needing to be no fewer than 1000 people but infrastructure requirements remain.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{Main|List of towns in Canada|Municipal government in Canada}}\nThe legal definition of a town in [[Canada]] varies by [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province or territory]], as each has jurisdiction over defining and legislating towns, cities and other types of municipal organization within its own boundaries.\n\nThe province of [[Quebec]] is unique in that it makes no distinction under law between towns and cities. There is no intermediate level in French between ''village'' and ''ville'' (''municipality'' is an administrative term usually applied to a legal, not geographical entity), so both are combined under the single legal status of ''[[ville]]''. While an informal preference may exist among English speakers as to whether any individual ''ville'' is commonly referred to as a city or as a town, no distinction and no objective legal criteria exist to make such a distinction under law.\n\n=== Chile ===\nIn [[Chile]], towns (Spanish: ''pueblos'') are defined by the National Statistics Institute (INE) as an urban entity with a population from 2001 to 5000 or an area with a population from 1001 to 2000 and an established economic activity.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nIn the Czech Republic, the word ''m\u011bsto'' (city) is used for very wide variety of municipalities, ranging from [[Prague]], the largest and capital city with approximately 1.2 million inhabitants, to the smallest, [[P\u0159ebuz]], with just 74 inhabitants.  Technically, a municipality must have at least 3,000 inhabitants to be granted the ''m\u011bsto'' title, although many smaller municipalities,  especially some former mining towns, retain the title ''m\u011bsto'' for historic reasons.  Currently, approximately 192 of the 592 ''m\u011bsta'' have less than 3,000 inhabitants.\n\nSome municipalities have been amalgamated together, such that the whole is considered as a ''m\u011bsto''.\n\n[[Statutory city (Czech Republic)|Statutory cities]] (''statut\u00e1rn\u00ed m\u011bsto''), which are defined by law no. 128/2000 Coll.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-128 |title=Consolidated version of Law no. 128/200 Coll |publisher=Zakonyprolidi.cz |date=2000-05-15 |accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref> can define their own self-governing municipal districts.. There are 25 such cities, in addition to [[Prague]], which is a ''de facto'' statutory city.\n\nIn 2006, the legal concept of a town (''[[m\u011bstys]]'', or formerly ''m\u011bste\u010dko'') was reintroduced. Currently, around 213 municipalities hold the title ''m\u011bstys''.\n\nMunicipalities which do not qualify as a ''m\u011bsto'' or a ''m\u011bstys'' default to the title of ''obec'' (a municipality) or, unofficially, a ''vesnice'' (village), even though they may consist of one or more villages.\n\n=== Denmark ===\nIn [[Denmark]], in many contexts no distinction is made between \"city\", \"town\" and \"village\"; all three translate as \"by\". In more specific use, for small villages and [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]] the word \"landsby\" (meaning \"country town\") is used, while the Danish equivalent of English \"city\" is \"storby\" (meaning \"large town\"). For formal purposes, [[urban area]]s having at least 200 inhabitants are counted as \"by\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/Vejviser/dokumentation/Varedeklarationer/emnegruppe/emne.aspx?sysrid=000766 |title=Byopg\u00f8relsen pr. 1. januar \u2013 Varedeklaration \u2013 Danmarks Statistik |publisher=Dst.dk |date=2005-03-22 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>\n\nHistorically some towns held various privileges, the most important of which was the right to hold market. They were administered separately from the rural areas in both fiscal, military and legal matters. Such towns are known as \"k\u00f8bstad\" (roughly the same meaning as \"borough\" albeit deriving from a different etymology) and they retain the exclusive right to the title even after the last vestiges of their privileges vanished through the reform of the local administration carried through in 1970.\n\n===Estonia===\nIn [[Estonia]], there is no distinction between a town and a city as the word ''linn'' is used for both bigger and smaller settlements, which are bigger than villages and boroughs. There are 30 [[Municipalities of Estonia|municipal towns]] (''omavalitsuslik linn'') in Estonia and a [[List of cities and towns in Estonia|further 17 towns]], which have merged with a municipal parish (''vallasisene linn'').\n\n[[File:Salins les Bains 2.JPG|thumb|The town of [[Salins-les-Bains]], [[France]]]]\n\n=== France ===\nFrom an administrative standpoint, the smallest level of local authorities are all called [[Communes of France|\"communes\"]]. Those can have anywhere from a handful to millions of inhabitants, and France has 36000 of them. The French term for \"town\" is \"[[:fr:Bourg|bourg]]\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/bourg |title=BOURG : D\u00e9finition de BOURG |date=n.d. |website=Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales' |access-date=March 22, 2020 |language=french |trans-title=BOURG: Definition of BOURG }}</ref> but French laws does not really distinguish between towns and cities which are all commonly called \"villes\". However, some laws do treat these authorities differently based on the population and different rules apply to the three big cities [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[Marseille]]. For historical reasons, [[List of French villages destroyed in World War I|six communes]] in the [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]] d\u00e9partement exist as independent administrative entities despite having no inhabitant at all.\n\nFor statistical purposes, the national statistical institute ([[INSEE]]) operates a distinction between urban areas with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants and bigger communes, the latter being called \"villes\". Smaller settlements are usually called \"villages\".\n\n[[File:Putbus (2011-05-21) 14.JPG|thumb|[[Putbus]] on [[R\u00fcgen|R\u00fcgen Island]], Germany]]\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Germany}}\n\n[[Germany|Germans]] do not, in general, differentiate between 'city' and 'town'. The German word for both is ''Stadt'', as it is the case in many other languages that do not differentiate between these Anglo-Saxon concepts. The word for a 'village', as a smaller settlement, is ''Dorf''. However, the International Statistics Conference of 1887 defined different sizes of ''Stadt'', based on their population size, as follows: ''Landstadt'' (\"country town\"; under 5,000), ''Kleinstadt'' (\"small town\"; 5,000 to 20,000), ''Mittelstadt'' (\"middle town\"; between 20,000 and 100,000) and ''Gro\u00dfstadt'' (\"large town\"; over 100,000).<ref>Universit\u00e4t Dortmund: [http://www.raumplanung.uni-dortmund.de/srp/web/dokumente/downloads/64_SRPapers%20Nr.1.pdf Kleine und mittlere St\u00e4dte \u2013 Blaupausen der Gro\u00dfstadt?], Dokumentation des Expertenkolloquiums am 29. April 2004 in Dortmund</ref> The term ''Gro\u00dfstadt'' may be translated as \"city\". In addition, Germans may speak of a ''Millionenstadt'', a city with over one million inhabitants (such as [[Munich]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]]).\n\nHistorically, many settlements became a ''Stadt'' by being awarded a [[Town privileges|''Stadtrecht'']] in medieval times. In modern German language use, the historical importance, the existence of central functions (education, retail etc.) and the population density of an urban place might also be taken as characteristics of a ''Stadt''. The modern local government organisation is subject to the laws of each [[States of Germany|state]] and refers to a ''Gemeinde'' ([[States of Germany#Municipalities (Gemeinden)|municipality]]), regardless of its historic title. While most ''Gemeinden'' form part of a ''Landkreis'' ([[States of Germany#Administrative districts (Kreise)|district]]) on a higher tier of local government, larger towns and cities may have the status of a ''kreisfreie Stadt'', combining both the powers of a municipality and a district.\n\nDesignations in different states are as diverse as e.g. in Australian States and Territories, and differ from state to state. In some German states, the words ''Markt'' (\"market\"), ''Marktflecken'' (both used in southern Germany) or ''Flecken'' (\"spot\"; northern Germany e.g. in [[Lower Saxony]]) designate a town-like residential community between ''Gemeinde'' and ''Stadt'' with special importance to its outer conurbation area. Historically those had ''Marktrecht'' (market right) but not full town privileges; see [[Market town]]. The legal denomination of a specific settlement may differ from its common designation (e.g. ''Samtgemeinde'' \u2013 a legal term in [[Lower Saxony]] for a group of villages [''Dorf'', pl. ''D\u00f6rfer''] with common local government created by combining municipalities [''Gemeinde'', pl. ''Gemeinden'']).\n\n=== Greece and Cyprus ===\nIn ordinary speech, [[Greeks]] use the word \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc (=village) to refer to smaller settlements and the word \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 or \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 (=city) to refer to larger ones. Careful speakers may also use the word \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7 to refer to towns with a population of 2,000\u20139,999. \nIn Greek administrative law there used to be a distinction between \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, i.e. municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants or considered important for some other geographical (county seats), historical or ecclesiastical (bishops' seats) reason, and \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, referring to smaller self-governing units, mostly villages. A sweeping reform, carried out in two stages early in the 21st century, merged most \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 with the nearest \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, dividing the whole country into 325 big self-governing \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9. The former municipalities survive as administrative subdivisions (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2).\n\nCyprus, including the Turkish-occupied areas, is also divided into 39 \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 (in principle, with at least 5,000 inhabitants, though there are exceptions) and 576 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2.\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Hong Kong#Towns|l1=List of cities and towns in Hong Kong}}\n[[File:ShatinTownHall 20070529.jpg|thumb|Nearly every town in Hong Kong has its own town hall.

The very first new towns included [[Tsuen Wan New Town|Tsuen Wan]] and [[Kwun Tong]]. In the late 1960s and the 1970s, another stage of new town developments was launched. Nine new towns have been developed so far. Land use is carefully planned and development provides plenty of room for public housing projects. Rail transport is usually available at a later stage. The first towns are [[Sha Tin New Town|Sha Tin]], [[Tsuen Wan New Town|Tsuen Wan]], [[Tuen Mun New Town|Tuen Mun]] and [[Tseung Kwan O]]. [[Tuen Mun New Town|Tuen Mun]] was intended to be self-reliant, but was not successful and turned into a [[bedroom community]] like the other new towns. More recent developments are [[Tin Shui Wai New Town|Tin Shui Wai]] and [[North Lantau New Town|North Lantau (Tung Chung-Tai Ho)]].\n\n=== Hungary ===\nIn [[Hungary]] there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in Hungarian is: v\u00e1ros). Nevertheless, the expressions formed by adding the adjectives \"kis\" (small) and \"nagy\" (large) to the beginning of the root word (e.g. \"nagyv\u00e1ros\") have been normalized to differentiate between cities and towns (towns being smaller, therefore bearing the name \"kisv\u00e1ros\".) In Hungary, a village can gain the status of \"v\u00e1ros\" (town), if it meets a set of diverse conditions for quality of life and development of certain public services and utilities (e.g. having a local secondary school or installing full-area sewage collection pipe network). Every year the Minister of Internal Affairs selects candidates from a committee-screened list of applicants, whom the President of Republic usually affirms by issuing a bill of town's rank to them. Since being a town carries extra fiscal support from the government, many relatively small villages try to win the status of \"v\u00e1rosi rang\" nowadays.\n\nBefore the [[fall of communism]] in 1990, Hungarian villages with fewer than 10,000 residents were not allowed to become towns. Recently some settlements as small as 2,500 souls have received the rank of town (e.g. Visegr\u00e1d, Zalakaros or G\u00f6nc) and meeting the conditions of development is often disregarded to quickly elevate larger villages into towns. As of middle 2013, there are 346 towns in Hungary, encompassing some 69% of the entire population.\n\nTowns of more than 50,000 people are able to gain the status of \"megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1ros\" (town with the rights of a [[county]]), which allows them to maintain a higher degree of [[Public service|services]]. (There are a few exceptions, when towns of fewer than 50,000 people gained the status: [[\u00c9rd]], [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]], [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]] and [[Szeksz\u00e1rd]])<ref>[http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/regiok/veszpremmjv10.pdf Megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1rosok] \u2013 essay of [[Hungarian Central Statistical Office]] (Hungarian, July 2012)</ref> As of middle 2013, there are only 23 such towns in Hungary.<ref>[http://www.terport.hu/telepulesek/telepulestipusok/megyei-jogu-varosok/magyarorszag-megyei-jogu-varosai \"Magyarorsz\u00e1g megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1rosai\"] \u2013 list of Hungarian town with the rights of a county on \"T\u00e9rport\" related webpage of Ministry of National Development (Hungarian, access date: May 4, 2013.)</ref>\n\n=== Iceland ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Iceland}}\n\n=== Ireland ===\n{{Main|List of populated places in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\nThe '''Local Government act 2001''' provides that from January 1, 2002 (section 10 subsection (3)\n''Within the county in which they are situated and of which they form part, there continue to be such other local government areas as are set out in Schedule 6 which \u2013 (a) in the case of the areas set out in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of that Schedule, shall be known as boroughs, and \u2013 (b) in the case of the areas set out in Chapter 2 of Part 1 and Part 2 of that Schedule, shall be known as towns, and in this Act a reference to a town shall include a reference to a borough.''\n\nThese provisions affect the replacement of the boroughs, Towns and urban districts which existed before then. Similar reforms in the nomenclature of local authorities ( but not their functions) are effected by section 11 part 17 of the act includes provision (section 185(2))\n''Qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census or such other figure as the Minister may from time to time prescribe by regulations, and not having a [[town council]], may make a proposal in accordance with paragraph (b) for the establishment of such a council''\nand contains provisions enabling the establishment of new town councils and provisions enabling the dissolution of existing or new town councils in certain circumstances\n\nThe reference to ''town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census'' hands much of the power relating to defining what is in fact a town over to the Central Statistics Office and their criteria are published as part of each census.\n\n;Planning and Development Act 2000\nAnother reference to the Census and its role in determining what is or is not a town for some administrative purpose is in the Planning and Development act 2000 (part II chapter I which provides for Local area plans)\n\n''A local area plan shall be made in respect of an area which \u2014(i) is designated as a town in the most recent census of population, other than a town designated as a suburb or environs in that census, (ii) has a population in excess of 2,000, and (iii) is situated within the functional area of a planning authority which is a county council.''\n\n;Central Statistics Office criteria\nThese are set out in full at [http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census_2006_Appendices.pdf 2006 Census Appendices].\n\nIn short they speak of \"towns with legally defined boundaries\" ( i.e. those established by the Local Government Act 2001) and the remaining 664 as \"census towns\", defined by themselves since 1971 as ''a cluster of 50 or more occupied dwellings in which within a distance of 800 meters there is a nucleus of 30 occupied houses on both sides of the road or twenty occupied houses on one side of the road'' there is also a ''200 meter criterion'' for determining whether a house is part of a census town.\n\n=== India ===\n[[File:One of the high streets in Paravur.jpg|right|thumb|A street in [[Paravur, Kollam|Paravur]] town, India]]\nThe [[2011 Census of India]] defines towns of two types: statutory town and [[census town]]. Statutory town is defined as all places with a [[municipality]], [[Municipal corporation|corporation]], [[Cantonment Board|cantonment board]] or notified town area committee. Census towns are defined as places that satisfy the following criteria:\n# Minimum population of 5,000\n# At least 75% of male working population engaged in non-agricultural pursuits\n# Density of population at least 400/km<sup>2</sup>. (1,000 per sq. mile).\n\nAll the statutory towns, census towns and [[out growth]]s are considered as urban settlements, as opposed to rural areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Some Concepts and Definitions|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/kerala/13-concept-34.pdf|publisher=Census of India|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Iran ===\nIn contemporary [[Persian language|Persian]] texts, no distinction is made between \"city\" and \"town\"; both translate as \"Shahr\" (\u0634\u0647\u0631). In older Persian texts (until the first half of the 20th century), the Arabic word \"Qasabeh\" (\u0642\u0635\u0628\u0647) was used for a town. However, in recent 50 years, this word has become obsolete.\n\nThere is a word in Persian which is used for special sort of satellite townships and city neighborhoods. It is ''Shahrak'' (\u0634\u0647\u0631\u06a9), (lit.: small city).\nAnother smaller type of town or [[neighborhood]] in a big city is called ''Kuy'' (\u06a9\u0648\u06cc). ''Shahrak'' and ''Kuy'' each have their different legal definitions.\nLarge cities such as [[Tehran]], [[Mashhad]], [[Isfahan]], [[Tabriz]], etc. which have millions of populations are referred to as ''Kalan-shahr''\u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0646\u200c\u0634\u0647\u0631 ([[metropole]]).\n\nThe pace in which different large villages have gained city status in [[Iran]] shows a dramatic increase in the last two decades.\n\nBigger cities and towns usually are centers of a [[township]] (in Persian: ''Shahrestan'' (\u0634\u0647\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646). Shahrestan itself is a subdivision of ''Ostan'' \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 (Province).\n\n===Isle of Man===\nThere are four settlements which are historically and officially designated as towns (Douglas, Ramsey, Peel, Castletown); however\n\n* Peel is also sometimes referred to as a city by virtue of its cathedral.\n* Onchan and Port Erin are both larger in population than the smallest \"town\", having expanded in modern times, but are designated as villages.\n\n=== Israel ===\n[[Modern Hebrew]] does provide a word for the concept of a town: ''Ayara'' (\u05e2\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4),  derived from ''Ir'' (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8), the biblical word for \"city\". However, the term ''ayara'' is normally used only to describe towns in foreign countries, i.e. urban areas of limited population, particularly when the speaker is attempting to evoke nostalgic or romantic attitudes. The term is also used to describe a [[Shtetl]], a pre-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] [[Eastern Europe]]an Jewish town.\n\nWithin Israel, established urban areas are always referred to as cities (with one notable exception explained below) regardless of their actual size. Israeli law does not define any nomenclature for distinction between urban areas based on size or any other factor \u2013 meaning that all urban settlements in Israel are legally referred to as \"cities\".\n\nThe exception to the above is the term ''Ayeret Pituakh'' (\u05e2\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05ea \u05e4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5\u05d7, lit. \"Development Town\") which is applied to certain cities in Israel based on the reasons for their establishment. These cities, created during the earlier decades of Israeli independence (1950s and 1960s, generally), were designed primarily to serve as commercial and transportation hubs, connecting smaller agricultural settlements in the northern and southern regions of the country (the \"Periphery\") to the major urban areas of the coastal and central regions. Some of these \"development towns\" have since grown to a comparatively large size, and yet are still referred to as \"development towns\", particularly when the speaker wishes to emphasize their (often low) socio-economic status. Nonetheless, they are rarely (if ever) referred to simply as \"towns\"; when referring to one directly, it will be called either a \"development town\" or a \"city\", depending on context.\n\n=== Italy ===\nAlthough Italian provides different words for city (''citt\u00e0''), town (''paese'') and village (''villaggio'', old-fashioned, or ''[[frazione]]'', most common), no legal definitions exist as to how settlements must be classified. Administratively, both towns and cities are ruled as [[comuni]]/[[comune]]s, while villages might be subdivisions of the former. \nGenerally, in everyday's speech, a town is larger or more populated than a village and smaller than a city. Various cities and towns together may form a metropolitan area (''area metropolitana''). A city, can also be a culturally, economically or politically prominent community with respect to surrounding towns. Moreover, a city can be such by [[President of Italy|Presidential]] decree. A town, in contrast, can be an inhabited place which would elsewhere be styled a city, but has not received any official recognition.\nRemarkable exceptions do exist: for instance, [[Bassano del Grappa]], was given the status of \"citt\u00e0\" in 1760 by [[Francesco Loredan]]'s [[Doge|dogal]] decree and has since then carried this title. Also, the Italian word for town (''paese'' with lowercase P) must not be confused with the Italian word for country/nation (''Paese'' usually with uppercase P).\n\n=== Japan ===\nIn Japan city status (''[[Cities of Japan|shi]]'') was traditionally reserved for only a few particularly large settlements. Over time however the necessary conditions to be a city have been watered down and today the only loose rules that apply are having a population over 50,000 and over 60% of the population in a \"city centre\". In recent times many small villages and towns have merged in order to form a city despite seeming geographically to be just a collection of villages.\n\nThe distinction between towns (''[[Towns of Japan|machi/ch\u014d]]'') and villages (''[[Villages of Japan|mura/son]]'') is largely unwritten and purely one of population size when the settlement was founded with villages having under 10,000 and towns 10,000\u201350,000.\n\n=== Korea ===\n{{main|Eup (administrative division)}}\nIn both of South Korea and North Korea, towns are called ''[[Eup (administrative division)|eup]]'' (''\uc74d'').\n\n=== Latvia ===\nIn [[Latvia]], towns and cities are indiscriminately called ''pils\u0113ta'' in singular form. The name is a [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of two Latvian words: ''pils'' (castle) and ''s\u0113ta'' (fence), making it very obvious what is meant by the word \u2013 what is situated between the castle and the castle fence. However, a city can be called ''lielpils\u0113ta'' in reference to its size. A village is called ''ciemats'' or ''ciems'' in Latvian.\n\n=== Lithuania ===\n{{main|List of towns in Lithuania}}\nIn [[Lithuania]]n,  a city is called ''[[:lt:miestas|miestas]]'', a town is called ''[[:lt:miestelis|miestelis]]'' (literally \"small ''miestas''). [[Metropolis]] is called ''[[:lt:didmiestis|didmiestis]]'' (literally \"big ''miestas'').\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nIn [[Malaysia]], a town is the area administered by Municipal Council ({{lang-ms|1=Majlis Perbandaran}}).\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nBefore 1848 there was a legal distinction between ''stad'' and non-''stad'' parts of the country, but the word no longer has any legal significance. About 220 places were granted ''stadsrechten'' (city rights) and are still so called for historical and traditional reasons, though the word is also used for large urban areas that never obtained such rights. Because of this, in the [[Netherlands]], no distinction is made between \"city\" and \"town\"; both translate as ''stad''. A hamlet (''gehucht'') usually has fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, a village (''dorp'') ranges from 1,000 up to 25,000 inhabitants, and a place above 25,000 can call itself either village or city, mostly depending on historic reasons or size of the place. As an example, [[The Hague]] never gained city rights, but because of its size - more than half a million inhabitants - it is regarded as a city. [[Staverden]], with only 40 inhabitants, would be a hamlet, but because of its city rights it may call itself a city.\n\nFor statistical purposes, the Netherlands has three sorts of cities:\n* ''kleine stad'' (small city): 50,000 \u2014 99,999 inhabitants\n* ''middelgrote stad'' (medium-sized city): 100,000 \u2014 249,999 inhabitants\n* ''grote stad'' (large city): 250,000 or more\n\nOnly [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Utrecht]] are regarded as a ''grote stad''.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIn [[New Zealand]], a town is a built-up area that is not large enough to be considered a city. Historically, this definition corresponded to a population of between approximately 1,000 and 20,000. Towns have no independent legal existence, being administered simply as built-up parts of districts, or, in some cases, of cities.\n\nNew Zealand's towns vary greatly in size and importance, ranging from small rural service centres to significant regional centres such as [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] and [[Taupo]]. Typically, once a town reaches a population of somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 people, it will begin to be informally regarded as a city. One who regards a settlement as too small to be a town will typically call it a \"township\" or \"village.\"\n\n=== Norway ===\nIn [[Norway]], \"city\" and \"town\" both translate to \"[[By (city or town)|by]]\", even if a city may be referred to as \"storby\" (\"large town\"). They will all be part of and administered as a \"[[Municipalities of Norway|kommune]]\" (\"[[municipality]]\").\n\nNorway has had inland the northernmost city in the world: Hammerfest. Now the record is held by New \u00c5lesund on the Norwegian island Svalbard\n\n=== Philippines ===\n[[File:Loboc Bohol 1.jpg|thumb|The town center of [[Loboc, Bohol]].]]\n{{Main|List of cities and municipalities in the Philippines|Municipalities of the Philippines}}\nIn the [[Philippines]], the local official equivalent of the town is the [[Philippine municipality|municipality]] (Filipino ''bayan''). Every municipality, or town, in the country has a mayor (Filipino ''alkalde'') and a vice mayor (Filipino ''bise alkalde'') as well as local town officials ([[Sangguniang Bayan]]). Philippine towns, otherwise called as municipalities, are composed of a number of villages and communities called ''[[barangays]]'' with one (or a few cluster of) ''barangay''(s) serving as the town center or ''[[poblacion]]''.\n\nUnique in Philippine towns is that they have fixed budget, population and land requirements to become as such, i.e. from a ''barangay'', or a cluster of such, to a town, or to become cities, i.e. from town to a city. Respectively, examples of these are the town of [[Braulio E. Dujali, Davao del Norte|B.E. Dujali]] in [[Davao del Norte]] province, which was formed in 1998 from a cluster of 5 ''barangays'', and the city of [[El Salvador, Misamis Oriental|El Salvador]], which was converted from a town to a city in 2007. Each town in the Philippines was classified by its [[Municipalities of the Philippines#Income classification|annual income and budget]].\n\nA sharp, hierarchical distinction exists between Philippine [[Philippine city|cities]] (Filipino ''lungsod'' or ''siyudad'') and towns, as towns in the country are juridically separate from cities, which are typically larger and more populous (some smaller and less populated) and which political and economic status are above those of towns. This was further supported and indicated by the income classification system implemented by the National Department of Finance, to which both cities and towns fell into their respective categories that indicate they are such as stated under Philippine law. However, both towns and cities equally share the status as [[Administrative divisions of the Philippines#Local government units|local government units]] (LGU's) grouped under and belong to [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] and [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]]; both each are composed of ''barangays'' and are governed by a mayor and a vice mayor supplemented by their respective LGU legislative councils.\n\n=== Poland ===\n[[File:Zamo\u015b\u0107. Ratusz..jpg|thumb|right|[[Zamo\u015b\u0107]] in [[Poland]] is an example of a [[utopia]]n [[ideal town]]. It was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1992]]\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Poland}}\n\nSimilarly to Germany and Sweden, in [[Poland]] there is no linguistic distinction between a city and a town. The word for both is ''miasto'', as a form of settlement distinct from following: village (wie\u015b), hamlet (przysi\u00f3\u0142ek), settlement (osada), or colony (kolonia). Town status is conferred by administrative decree, new towns are announced by the Government in a separate Bill effective from the first day of the year. Some settlements tend to remain villages even though they have a larger population than many smaller towns. Town may be called in diminutive way as \"miasteczko\", what is colloquially used for localities with a few thousand residents. Such localities have usually a '''Mayor''' (burmistrz) as a chief of town council.\n\nCities are the biggest localities, generally must be bigger than 100 thousand of residents, they are ruled by '''President''' (prezydent) as a chief of City Council. There are bare a few (mainly historic or political) exemptions which have allowed towns lesser than 100 thousand of people, to obtain President title for their Mayors, and to become recognized as Cities that way. Just to name a few: [[Boles\u0142awiec]], [[Gniezno]], [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]].\n\n=== Portugal ===\nLike other Iberian cultures, in [[Portugal]] there is a traditional distinction between towns (''[[:pt:Vila|vilas]]'') and cities (''[[:pt:Cidade|cidades]]''). Similarly, although these areas are not defined under the constitution, and have no political function (with associated organs), they are defined by law,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.povt.qren.pt/tempfiles/20080213151143moptc.pdf |title=Law n.\u00ba 11/82 (Lei das designa\u00e7\u00f5es e determina\u00e7\u00e3o de categoria das povoa\u00e7\u00f5es), of June, 2nd |accessdate=2010-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100608050009/http%3A//www.povt.qren.pt/tempfiles/20080213151143moptc.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-08 }}</ref> and a town must have:\n* at least 3,000 inhabitants\n* at least half of these services: health unit, pharmacy, cultural centre, public transportation network, post office, commercial food and drinking establishments, primary school and/or bank office\nIn this context, the town or city is subordinate to the local authority ([[freguesia|civil parish]] or [[concelho|municipality]], in comparison to the North American context, where they have political functions. In special cases, some [[village]]s may be granted the status of town if they possess historical, cultural or architectonic importance.\n\nThe Portuguese urban settlements [[heraldry]] reflects the difference between towns and cities,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/pt-_m.html#rules |website=Flags of the World|title = Portuguese municipal flags |publisher= Crwflags.com |accessdate=}}</ref> with the [[coat of arms]] of a town bearing a crown with 4 towers, while the coat of arms of a city bears a crown with 5 towers. This difference between towns and cities is still in use in other Portuguese speaking countries, but in Brazil is no longer in use.\n\n=== Romania ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Romania}}\n\nIn [[Romania]] there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is: ''ora\u015f''). Cities and towns in Romania can have the status either of ''ora\u015f'' [[municipiu]], conferred to large urban areas, or only ''ora\u015f'' to smaller urban localities. Some settlements remain villages ([[Communes of Romania|communes]]) even though they have a larger population than other smaller towns.\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Main|Types of inhabited localities in Russia}}\n\n[[File:moscow reutov.jpg|thumb|The town of [[Reutov]] is separated from the city of [[Moscow]] just by the [[Moscow Ring Road|MKAD]] highway]]\n\nUnlike [[English language|English]], the [[Russian language]] does not distinguish the terms \"city\" and \"town\"\u2014both are translated as \"{{lang|ru|\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434}}\" (''gorod'').  Occasionally the term \"{{lang|ru|\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434}}\" is applied to [[urban-type settlement]]s as well, even though the status of those is not the same as that of a city/town proper.\n\nIn Russia, the criteria an inhabited locality needs to meet in order to be granted city/town (''gorod'') status vary in different [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]]. In general, to qualify for this status, an inhabited locality should have more than 12,000 inhabitants and the occupation of no less than 85% of inhabitants must be other than agriculture. However, inhabited localities which were previously granted the city/town status but no longer meet the criteria can still retain the status for historical reasons.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{main|New towns of Singapore}}\nIn Singapore, towns are large scale satellite housing developments which are designed to be self contained. It includes public housing units, a town centre and other amenities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Maisy|date=July 2014|title=Estimating the distortionary effects of ethnic quotas in Singapore using housing transactions|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=115|issue=|pages=131\u2013145|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.04.006|pmid=|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/real-estate_papers/9}}</ref> Helmed by a hierarchy of commercial developments, ranging from a town centre to precinct-level outlets, there is no need to venture out of town to meet the most common needs of residences. Employment can be found in industrial estates located within several towns. Educational, health care, and recreational needs are also taken care of with the provision of schools, hospitals, parks, sports complexes, and so on. The most populous town in the country is [[Bedok]].\n[[File:1 2014 panorama bishan park aerial gopro dji phantom.jpg|600px|thumb|center|[[Bishan, Singapore|Bishan]], one of Singapore's towns is the 38th biggest in terms of geographical size and the 21st most populated planning area in the country.]]\n\n===South Africa===\nIn South Africa the [[Afrikaans]] term \"Dorp\" is used interchangeably with the English equivalent of \"Town\". A \"town\" is a settlement that has a size that is smaller than that of a city.\n\n=== Spain ===\nIn [[Spain]], the equivalent of town would be ''villa,'' a population unit between a village (''pueblo)'' and a city ''(ciudad)'', and is not defined by the number of inhabitants, but by some historical rights and privileges dating from the Middle Ages, such as the right to hold a market or fair. For instance, while [[Madrid]] is technically a ''villa'', [[Barcelona]], with a smaller population, is known as a city.\n\n=== Sweden ===\n[[File:\u00d6vre Finngr\u00e4nd 7 Sta Maria 29 Visby Gotland.jpg|thumbnail|View towards [[Visby Cathedral|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Visby]], [[Sweden]]. Visby is one of the most well-preserved former [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities in Sweden and a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Today it is the seat of [[Gotland Municipality]].]]\n{{See also|Stad (Sweden)|K\u00f6ping}}\n\nThe [[Swedish language]] does not differentiate between towns and cities in the English sense of the words; both words are commonly translated as ''stad'', a term which has no legal significance today. The term ''t\u00e4tort'' is used for an [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]] or a locality, which however is a statistical rather than an administrative concept and encompasses densely settled villages with only 200 inhabitants as well as the major cities. The word ''[[k\u00f6ping]]'' corresponds to an English ''[[market town]]'' ''(chipping)'' or German ''[[wikt:Markt|Markt]]'' but is mainly of historical significance, as the term is not used today and only survives in some [[toponym]]s. Some towns with names ending in ''-k\u00f6ping'' are cities with over 100 000 inhabitants today, e.g. [[Link\u00f6ping]].\n\nBefore 1971, 132 larger [[Municipality|municipalities]] in [[Sweden]] enjoyed special royal charters as ''[[Stad (Sweden)|stad]]'' instead of ''[[kommun]]'' (which is similar to a US [[County (United States)|county]]). However, since 1971 all municipalities are officially defined as ''kommun'', thus making no legal difference between, for instance, [[Stockholm]] and a small countryside municipality. Every urban area that was a ''stad'' before 1971 is still often referred to as a ''stad'' in daily speech. Since the 1980s, 14 of these municipalities brand themselves as ''stad'' again, although this has no legal or administrative significance, as they still have refer to themselves as ''kommun'' in all legal documentation.\n\nFor statistical purposes, [[Statistics Sweden]] officially defines a ''stad'' as an [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]] of at least 10,000 inhabitants. In the [[Swedish language]] the term for a major city is ''storstad'' (literally \"big town\"), but there is no clear definition as to when a ''stad'' should be called a ''storstad''. Most Swedes would only call [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malm\u00f6]] ''storst\u00e4der'', i.e. \"major cities\", although [[Uppsala]] fulfills the definition of \"municipality with a population that exceeds 200 000 inhabitants\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/statistik/BE/LE0102/2002A01/LE0102_2002A01_BR_12_BE51ST0307.pdf |title=Bilaga 1.

Public electronic dictionary of Ukrainian language (ukrlit.org)</ref> Historically, town in the Ukrainian lands was a smaller populated place that was chartered under the [[German town law]] and had a market square (see [[Market town]]). \nToday informally, town is also referred to [[City of district significance (Ukraine)|cities of district significance]], cities with small population, and former Jewish [[shtetl]]s.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{Main|City status in the United Kingdom}}\n\n==== England and Wales ====\n{{Main|List of urban areas in England by population|list of urban areas in Wales by population}}\n\n[[File:Rugby town centre.jpg|thumb|left|A traditional English town centre at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]]]\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]], a town traditionally was a settlement which had a charter to hold a [[Market (place)|market]] or [[fair]] and therefore became a \"[[market town]]\". Market towns were distinguished from villages in that they were the economic hub of a surrounding area, and were usually larger and had more facilities.\n\nIn parallel with popular usage, however, there are many technical and official definitions of what constitutes a town, to which various interested parties cling.\n\nIn modern official usage the term ''town'' is employed either for old market towns, or for settlements which have a [[town council]], or for settlements which elsewhere would be classed a city, but which do not have [[City status in the United Kingdom|the legal right]] to call themselves such. Any parish council can decide to describe itself as a town council, but this will usually only apply to the smallest \"towns\" (because larger towns will be larger than a single civil parish).\n\nNot all settlements which are commonly described as towns have a \"Town Council\" or \"Borough Council\". In fact, because of many successive changes to the structure of local government, there are now few large towns which are represented by a body closely related to their historic borough council. These days, a smaller town will usually be part of a local authority which covers several towns. And where a larger town '''is''' the seat of a local authority, the authority will usually cover a much wider area than the town itself (either a large rural hinterland, or several other, smaller towns).\n\nAdditionally, there are \"[[new town]]s\" which were created during the 20th century, such as [[Basildon]], [[Redditch]] and [[Telford]]. [[Milton Keynes]] was designed to be a \"new city\" but legally it is still a town despite its size.\n\nSome settlements which describe themselves as towns (e.g. [[Shipston-on-Stour]], [[Warwickshire]]) are smaller than some large villages (e.g. [[Kidlington]], [[Oxfordshire]]).\n\nThe status of a ''city'' is reserved for places that have [[letters patent]] entitling them to the name, historically associated with the possession of a cathedral. Some large municipalities (such as [[Northampton]] and [[Bournemouth]]) are legally [[borough]]s but not cities, whereas some cities are quite small \u2014 such as [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] or [[St David's]]. The city of [[Brighton and Hove]] was created from the two former towns and some surrounding villages, and within the city the correct term for the former distinct entities is somewhat unclear.\n\n[[File:Windhill.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop's Stortford]]]]\n\nIt appears that a city may become a town, though perhaps only through administrative error: [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in Kent had been a city for centuries but, when in 1998 the [[Medway]] district was created, a bureaucratic blunder meant that Rochester lost its official [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] and is now technically a town.\n\nIt is often thought that towns with [[cathedral|bishops' seats]] rank automatically as cities: however, [[Chelmsford]] was a town until 5 June 2012 despite being the seat of the [[diocese of Chelmsford]], created in 1914. [[St Asaph]], which is the seat of the [[diocese of St Asaph]], only became a city on 1 June 2012 though the diocese was founded in the mid sixth century. In reality, the pre-qualification of having a cathedral of the established [[Church of England]], and the formerly established [[Church in Wales]] or [[Church of Ireland]], ceased to apply from 1888.\n\nThe word ''town'' can also be used as a general term for urban areas, including cities and in a few cases, districts within cities. In this usage, a city is a type of town; a large one, with a certain status. For example, central [[Greater London]] is sometimes referred to colloquially as \"London town\". (The \"[[City of London]]\" is the historical nucleus, informally known as the \"Square Mile\", and is administratively separate from the rest of Greater London, while the [[City of Westminster]] is also technically a city and is also a [[London borough]].) [[Camden Town]] and [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] are districts of London, as [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] is a district of [[Edinburgh]] \u2013 actually the Georgian centre.\n\nIn recent years the division between cities and towns has grown, leading to the establishment of groups like the Centre for Towns, who work to highlight the issues facing many towns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.centrefortowns.org/about-us|title=About Us|last=Design|first=Concom Website|website=Centre For Towns|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> Towns also became a significant issue in the [[2020 Labour Party leadership election]], with [[Lisa Nandy]] making significant reference to Labour needing to win back smaller towns which have swung away from the party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/economy/house/house-magazine/107129/lisa-nandy-mp-britains-towns-are-short-changed-cities|title=Lisa Nandy MP: Britain\u2019s towns are short-changed as cities capture an ever-greater share of foreign investment|last=PoliticsHome.com|date=2019-10-08|website=PoliticsHome.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==== Scotland ====\n{{Main|List of burghs in Scotland|List of towns and cities in Scotland by population}}\n\nA ''town'' in [[Scotland]] has no specific legal meaning and (especially in areas which were or are still [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking) can refer to a mere collection of buildings (e.g. a ''farm-town'' or in [[Scots language|Scots]] ''ferm-toun''), not all of which might be inhabited, or to an inhabited area of any size which is not otherwise described in terms such as [[city]], [[burgh]], etc. Many locations of greatly different size will be encountered with a name ending with ''-town'', ''-ton'', ''-toun'' etc. (or beginning with the Gaelic equivalent ''baile'' etc.).\n\nA [[burgh]] (pronounced ''burruh'') is the [[Scots language|Scots']] term for a town or a municipality. They were highly [[Autonomous area|autonomous]] units of [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] from at least the 12th century until their abolition in 1975, when a new [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|regional structure of local government]] was introduced across the country. Usually based upon a town, they had a [[municipal corporation]] and certain rights, such as a degree of [[self-governance]] and representation in the sovereign [[Parliament of Scotland]] adjourned in 1707.\n\nThe term no longer describes units of local government although various claims are made from time to time that the legislation used was not competent to change the status of the Royal Burghs described below. The status is now chiefly ceremonial but various functions have been inherited by current Councils (e.g. the application of various endowments providing for public benefit) which might only apply within the area previously served by a burgh; in consequence a burgh can still exist (if only as a defined geographical area) and might still be signed as such by the current local authority. The word 'burgh' is generally not used as a synonym for 'town' or 'city' in everyday speech, but is reserved mostly for government and administrative purposes.\n\nHistorically, the most important burghs were [[royal burgh]]s, followed by [[burgh of regality|burghs of regality]] and [[burgh of barony|burghs of barony]]. Some newer settlements were only designated as [[police burgh]]s from the 19th century onward, a classification which also applies to most of the older burghs.\n\n=== United States ===\n[[File:Wyatt-indiana-from-above.jpg|thumb|The tiny farming community of [[Wyatt, Indiana]]]]\n\nThe definition of \"town\" varies widely from state to state and in many states there is no official definition. In some states, the term \"town\" refers to an area of population distinct from others in some meaningful dimension, typically population or type of government. The characteristic that distinguishes a town from another type of populated place &mdash; a city, borough, village, or [[Civil township|township]], for example &mdash; differs from state to state. In some states, a town is an incorporated [[municipality]]; that is, one with a [[charter]] received from the state, similar to a city (see [[incorporated town]]), while in others, a town is unincorporated. In some instances, the term \"town\" refers to a small incorporated municipality of less than a population threshold specified by state statute, while in others a town can be significantly larger. Some states do not use the term \"town\" at all, while in others the term has no official meaning and is used informally to refer to a populated place, of any size, whether incorporated or unincorporated. In still other states, the words \"town\" and \"city\" are legally interchangeable.\n\nSmall town life has been a major theme in American literature, especially stories of rejection by young people leaving for the metropolis.<ref>Miles Orvell, ''The Death and Life of Main Street: Small Towns in American Memory, Space, and Community'' (University of North Carolina Press; 2012)</ref>\n\nSince the use of the term varies considerably by state, individual usages are presented in the following sections:\n\n====Alabama====\nIn [[Alabama]], the legal use of the terms \"town\" and \"city\" is based on population.  A municipality with a population of 2,000 or more is a city, while less than 2,000 is a town (Code of Alabama 1975, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130616104014/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/11-40-6.htm Section 11-40-6]).  For legislative purposes, municipalities are divided into eight classes based on population.  Class 8 includes all towns, plus cities with populations of less than 6,000 (Code of Alabama 1975, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130616104906/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/11-40-12.htm Section 11-40-12]).\n\n====Arizona====\n\nIn [[Arizona]], the terms \"town\" and \"city\" are largely interchangeable. A community may incorporate under either a town or a city organization with no regard to population or other restrictions according to Arizona law (see Arizona Revised Statutes, Title 9). Cities may function under slightly differing governmental systems, such as the option to organize a district system for city governments, but largely retain the same powers as towns. Arizona law also allows for the consolidation of neighboring towns and the unification of a city and a town, but makes no provision for the joining of two adjacent cities.\n\n====California====\nIn [[California]], the words \"town\" and \"city\" are synonymous by law (see Cal. Govt. Code Secs. 34500\u201334504). There are two types of cities in California: charter and general law. Cities organized as charter cities derive their authority from a [[municipal charter|charter]] that they draft and file with the state, and which, among other things, states the municipality's name as \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name).\" Government Code Sections 34500\u201334504 applies to cities organized as [[general-law municipality|general law cities]], which differ from charter cities in that they do not have charters but instead operate with the powers conferred them by the pertinent sections of the Government Code. Like charter cities, general law cities may incorporate as \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name).\"\n\nSome cities change their minds as to how they want to be called. The sign in front of the municipal offices in [[Los Gatos, California]], for example, reads \"City of Los Gatos\", but the words engraved on the building above the front entrance when the city hall was built read \"Town of Los Gatos.\" There are also signs at the municipal corporation limit, some of which welcome visitors to the \"City of Los Gatos\" while older, adjacent signs welcome people to the \"Town of Los Gatos.\" Meanwhile, the village does not exist in California as a municipal corporation. Instead, the word \"town\" is commonly used to indicate any unincorporated community that might otherwise be known as an unincorporated village. Additionally, some people may still use the word \"town\" as shorthand for \"township\", which is not an incorporated municipality but an administrative division of a county.\n\n====Hawaii====\n\nThe [[Hawaii]]an Island of [[Oahu]] has various communities that may be referred to as towns. However, the entire island is lumped as a single incorporated city, the City and County of [[Honolulu]]. The towns on Oahu are merely unincorporated [[census-designated place]]s.\n\n====Illinois====\nIn [[Illinois]], the word \"town\" has been used both to denote a subdivision of a county called a township,<ref>See the Township Code, 60 ILCS 1 et seq.</ref> and to denote a form of municipality similar to a [[village]], in that it is generally governed by a president and trustees rather than a mayor.<ref>See ''Phillips v. Town of Scales Mound'', 195 Ill. 353, 357, 63 N.E. 180 (1902)</ref> In some areas a \"Town\" may be incorporated legally as a Village (meaning it has at large Trustees) or a City (meaning it has aldermen from districts) and absorb the duties of the Township it is coterminous with (maintenance of birth records, certain welfare items). [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]] and [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]] are examples of Towns in this manner. Under the current Illinois Municipal Code, an incorporated or unincorporated town may choose to incorporate as a city or as a village, but other forms of incorporation are no longer allowed.<ref>''See generally'' Article 2 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/2\u20111\u20111 et seq.</ref>\n\n====Louisiana====\nIn [[Louisiana]] a \"town\" is defined as being a municipal government having a population of 1,001 to 4,999 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/gc021x2.pdf |title=Individual State Descriptions: 2002 |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref>\n\n====Maryland====\n\nWhile a \"town\" is generally considered a smaller entity than a \"city\", the two terms are legally interchangeable in Maryland.  The only exception may be the [[independent city]] of [[Baltimore]], which is a special case, as it was created by the [[Constitution of Maryland]].\n\n====Nevada====\n\nIn [[Nevada]], a town has a form of government, but is not considered to be incorporated. It generally provides a limited range of services, such as [[land use planning]] and recreation, while leaving most services to the county. Many communities have found this \"semi-incorporated\" status attractive; the state has only 20 incorporated [[List of cities in Nevada|cities]], and towns as large as [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] (186,020 in 2000 Census), home of the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Most [[county seat]]s are also towns, not cities.\n\n====New England====\n{{Main|New England town}}\n\nIn the six [[New England]] states, a [[New England town|town]] is a municipality and a more important unit than the [[county]]. In [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]] and 7 out of 14 counties in [[Massachusetts]], in fact, counties only exist as map divisions and have no legal functions; in the other three states, counties are primarily judicial districts, with other functions primarily in [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]], and [[Vermont]]. In all six, towns perform functions that in most states would be county functions. The defining feature of a New England town, as opposed to a city, is that a [[town meeting]] and a [[board of selectmen]] serve as the main form of government for a town, while cities are run by a mayor and a city council. For example, [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] is a town, even though it is fairly urban, because of its form of government.\n\n====New Jersey====\n{{Main|Town (New Jersey)}}\n\nA \"town\" in the context of New Jersey local government refers to one of five types and one of eleven forms of municipal government. While Town is often used as a shorthand to refer to a Township, the two are not the same. The Town Act of 1895 allowed any municipality or area with a population exceeding 5,000 to become a Town through a petition and referendum process. Under the 1895 Act, a newly incorporated town was divided into at least three wards, with two councilmen per ward serving staggered two-year terms, and one councilman at large, who also served a two-year term. The councilman at large served as chairman of the town council. The Town Act of 1988 completely revised the Town form of government and applied to all towns incorporated under the Town Act of 1895 and to those incorporated by a special charter granted by the Legislature prior to 1875.\n\nUnder the 1988 Act, the mayor is also the councilman at large, serving a term of two years, unless increased to three years by a petition and referendum process. The Council under the Town Act of 1988 consists of eight members serving staggered two-year terms with two elected from each of four wards. One councilman from each ward is up for election each year. Towns with different structures predating the 1988 Act may retain those features unless changed by a petition and referendum process. Two new provisions were added in 1991 to the statutes governing towns, First, a petition and referendum process was created whereby the voters can require that the mayor and town council be elected to four-year terms of office. The second new provision defines the election procedure in towns with wards. The mayor in a town chairs the town council and heads the municipal government. The mayor may both vote on legislation before council and veto ordinances. A veto may be overridden by a vote of two-thirds of all the members of the council. The council may enact an ordinance to delegate all or a portion of the executive responsibilities of the town to a municipal administrator. Fifteen New Jersey municipalities currently have a type of Town, nine of which operate under the town form of government.\n\n====New York====\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of New York#Town}}\nIn [[Administrative divisions of New York|New York]], a town is similarly a division of the county, but with less importance than in New England. Of some importance, a town provides a closer level of governance than its enclosing county, providing almost all municipal services to unincorporated communities, called [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlets]], and selected services to incorporated areas, called [[Village (New York)|villages]]. In New York, a town typically contains a number of such hamlets and villages. However, due to their independent nature, incorporated villages may exist in two towns or even two counties (example: [[Almond (village), New York]]). Everyone in New York who does not live on an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] reservation or a city lives in a town and possibly in one of the town's hamlets or villages. (There are no towns in the five counties \u2013 also known as [[Boroughs (New York City)|boroughs]] \u2013 that make up [[New York City]].)\n\n====North Carolina====\nIn [[North Carolina]], all cities, towns, and villages are incorporated as [[List of municipalities in North Carolina|municipalities]]. According to the North Carolina League of Municipalities,<ref>{{cite web|website = North Carolina League of Municipalities|title = How NC Cities Work|url = https://www.nclm.org/advocacy/how-nc-cities-work |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516211303/http://www.nclm.org/resource-center/Pages/How-Municipalities-Work.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-16 }}</ref> there is no legal distinction among a city, town, or village\u2014it is a matter of preference of the local government.  Some North Carolina cities have populations as small as 1,000 residents, while some towns, such as [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], have populations of greater than 100,000.\n\n====Oklahoma====\nAccording to the definitions in the Oklahoma Municipal Code, \"City\" means a municipality which has incorporated as a city in accordance with the laws of the state; \"Town\" means a municipality which has incorporated as a town in accordance with the laws of the state; and, a \"Municipality\" means any incorporated city or town.<ref name=\u201dOklahomaLaw1\u201d>{{cite web|url= https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=75748 |title= 11 O.S. 1-102 (Oklahoma Statutes, Title 11, Cities and Towns; Chapter 1, Oklahoma Municipal Code; Section 1-102, Definitions)|publisher=Oklahoma State Courts Network|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>  The term \u201cVillage\u201d is not defined or used in the act.<ref name=\u201dOklahomaLaw1\u201d />  Any community of people residing in compact form may become incorporated as a Town; however, if the resident population is one thousand or more, a Town or community of people residing in compact form may become incorporated as a City.<ref name=\u201dOklahomaLaw2\u201d>{{cite web|url= https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=75750|title= 11 O.S. 2-101 (Oklahoma Statutes, Title 11, Cities and Towns; Chapter 1, Oklahoma Municipal Code; Section 2-101, Incorporation of a Municipality)|publisher=Oklahoma State Courts Network|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Pennsylvania====\nIn [[Pennsylvania]], only one municipality is incorporated as a \"town\": [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania|Bloomsburg]]. Most of the rest of the state is incorporated as townships (there are also boroughs and cities), which function in much the same way as the towns of New York or New England, although they may have different forms of government.\n\n====Texas====\nIn [[Texas]], although some municipalities refer to themselves as \"towns\" or \"villages\" (to market themselves as an attractive place to live), these names have no specific designation in Texas law; legally all incorporated places are considered [[List of municipalities in Texas|cities]].\n\n====Utah====\n{{see also|List of cities and towns in Utah}}\nIn [[Utah]], the legal use of the terms \"town\" and \"city\" is based on population. A municipality with a population of 1,000 or more is a city, while less than 1,000 is a town. In addition, cities are divided into five separate classes based on population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm|title=Utah Code, Title 10, Chapter 2, Section 301|publisher=Utah State Legislature|accessdate=May 11, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808233054/http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm|archivedate=August 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Virginia====\n{{main|Administrative divisions of Virginia#Towns}}\nIn [[Virginia]], a town is an incorporated municipality similar to a city (though with a smaller required minimum population).  But while cities are by Virginia law independent of counties, towns are contained within counties.<ref>{{cite web  |author=[http://cfs.gmu.edu/bio/grymes_c.html Charles A. Grymes]  |url=http://virginiaplaces.org/vagupnova/countytowncity.html  |title=County vs. Town vs. City in Virginia  |accessdate=2011-05-31  |quote=Cities own and maintain their roads, while Virginia counties (except for Arlington and Henrico) rely upon [[Virginia Department of Transportation|VDOT]] for road maintenance. Cities get a fixed allocation of state funding for building and maintaining those roads, while counties must compete with each other and other VDOT priorities for a substantial portion of their road budget. Cities have been granted more authorities, such as the right of city councils to issue bonds to build roads without a voter referendum (counties must get voter approval in a referendum before issuing road bonds)... In Virginia, towns have distinct boundaries, established by the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] or by courts guided by laws passed by the legislature. Towns are *not* independent from counties; residents of towns are still residents of the county in which the town is located. For example, residents of the four towns of [[Haymarket, Virginia|Haymarket]], [[Quantico, Virginia|Quantico]], [[Dumfries, Virginia|Dumfries]], and [[Occoquan, Virginia|Occoquan]] are also residents of [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]]. They pay both town and county property taxes, and town residents get to vote for a town council/mayor.  |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620092601/http://virginiaplaces.org/vagupnova/countytowncity.html  |archivedate=2010-06-20  }}</ref>\n\n====Washington====\n{{Further|City government in Washington (state)}}\nA town in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] is a municipality that has a population of less than 1,500 at incorporation, however an existing town can reorganize as a code city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/governance/locgov31.aspx |title=Classification of Washington Cities |publisher=Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington |accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref> Town government authority is limited relative to [[city (Washington)|cities]], the other main classification of municipalities in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/management/forms/townandcodecity.aspx |title=A Comparison of the Powers of a Town and a Noncharter Code City |publisher=Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington |accessdate=December 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725204227/http://www.mrsc.org/Subjects/Management/forms/townandcodecity.aspx |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> {{As of|2012}}, most municipalities in Washington are cities.

Roper mostly provided instrumental backup to Nixon's lyrics. Nixon and Roper released their first album in 1985 on [[Enigma Records]], ''[[Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper (album)|Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper]]''. The song \"Jesus at McDonald's\" from that album was the duo's first single.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nNixon and Roper's third album, 1987's ''[[Bo-Day-Shus!!!]]'' featured the song \"Elvis is Everywhere,\" a deification of [[Elvis Presley]], which is probably his best known song (Nixon later declared his personal [[Trinity|religious trinity]] was Presley, [[Foghorn Leghorn]] and [[Otis Campbell]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMojo Nixon and Skid Roper were also recorded in San Francisco during these early years by producer [[Sylvia Massy]] at [[CD Presents]] for the \"Rat Music For Rat People\" compilation album.\nThroughout the late 1980s, Nixon and Roper produced several satirical pieces lampooning contemporary celebrities, such as [[MTV]] [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]] [[Martha Quinn]], in \"Stuffin' Martha's Muffin,\" and [[Rick Astley]] and [[Deborah Gibson]], in \"[[Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant with My Two-Headed Love Child]]\" Nixon appeared in several promotional spots for MTV during this period, but the network's decision not to air the video for \"Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant ...\" prompted him to sever ties with the network. Meanwhile, Nixon and Roper also lampooned contemporary American culture and social issues in songs such as \"I Hate Banks,\" \"Burn Down the Malls,\" and \"The Amazing Bigfoot Diet.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nNixon and Roper parted ways late in 1989. The following year Nixon recorded a solo album on Enigma called ''[[Otis (Mojo Nixon album)|Otis]]''. On this album, Nixon continued his assault on pop culture, as in the song \"[[Don Henley]] Must Die\", which caused a fresh round of controversy, even to the point of Mojo's record company begging radio stations ''not'' to play it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} (Henley himself was unfazed; on July 31, 1992 at The Hole in the Wall in [[Austin, Texas]], the former Eagle jumped onstage and performed the song with Nixon, causing Mojo to praise Henley as having \"balls as big as church bells.\")<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2014-06-20/don-henley-must-die/</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nShortly after ''Otis'' was released, Enigma Records went [[bankrupt]], which in turn left much of Nixon's early catalog in legal limbo.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} In the 1990s Nixon released a handful of albums on several labels with a backup band known as the Toadliquors. These later albums included songs such as \"You Can't Kill Me,\" \"[[O.J. Simpson|Orenthal James]] (Was A Mighty Bad Man),\" and the controversial \"Bring Me the Head of [[David Geffen]],\" which was ultimately released on a [[B-side]] collection due to pressure from album distributors. Also among his later work was \"[[Tie My Pecker To My Leg]],\" which featured lyrics about [[bestiality]], [[incest]], and [[coprophilia]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the mid-1990s Nixon collaborated on albums with [[Jello Biafra]] (''[[Prairie Home Invasion]]''), [[Dave Alvin]], and members of the [[Beat Farmers]], including [[Bernard Seigal|Buddy \"Blue\" Seigal]] (''Live in Las Vegas'' by the Pleasure Barons). [[Country Dick Montana]] of the Beat Farmers, who was a close friend of Nixon's, was eulogized on Nixon's 1999 album, ''The Real Sock Ray Blue'', after his 1995 death onstage of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Before his death the two enjoyed poking fun at each other such as Country Dick saying on stage that he'd been \"fucking Mojo's Mama\" which led to Nixon to retort: \"Country Dick can keep on fucking my mama, as long as he keeps on sucking my dick\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nNixon officially retired from the music business in 2004, playing his last live show on March 20 of that year at the Continental Club in [[Austin, Texas]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Acting==\nNixon made his acting debut as drummer [[Jimmy Van Eaton|James Van Eaton]] in the 1989 [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] bio-pic, ''[[Great Balls of Fire!

The game's licensed Psychobilly soundtrack also features two of his songs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==DJing and other media==\nIn the late 1990s Nixon worked as a radio DJ in San Diego (on KGB-FM) and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] (on [[WEBN|WEBN-FM]]). \n\nIn 1998 he had a short run as an [[advice column]]ist with \"Life Fixin' with Mojo Nixon\". Only two columns were authored, and both ran in the short-lived ''Peterbelly Magazine''.

As Nixon said at the time, \"If supporting Kinky for Governor is what it takes to drag my ass out of retirement, consider my ass dragged.\"\n\nIn October 2009, he announced his \"unretirement\" on his website with the release of his album ''Whiskey Rebellion'', a collection of previously unreleased tracks he claims he had found in \"an old shoe box full of cassette tapes\" under his front porch.<ref name=\"www.journalstar.com\">Wolgamott, Kent L.

He was [[Emperor of the French]] as '''Napoleon I''' from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]]. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a [[First French Empire|large empire]] that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.<ref name=\"Roberts, Andrew 2014\">Roberts, Andrew. ''Napoleon: A Life''.

He was serving as an artillery officer in the French army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789. He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military, seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24. The [[French Directory]] eventually gave him command of the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] after he suppressed the [[13 Vend\u00e9miaire]] revolt against the government from royalist insurgents. At age 26, he began his [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|first military campaign]] against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs\u2014winning virtually every battle, conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing \"[[sister republic]]s\" with local support, and becoming a war hero in France. In 1798, he led a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|military expedition to Egypt]] that served as a springboard to political power. He orchestrated a [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup in November 1799]] and became [[French Consulate|First Consul]] of the Republic. After the Peace of Amiens in 1802, Napoleon turned his attention to France's colonies. He sold the [[Louisiana Territory]] to the United States, and he attempted to restore slavery to the French Caribbean colonies. However, while he was successful in restoring slavery in the eastern Caribbean, Napoleon failed in his attempts to subdue [[Saint-Domingue]], and the colony that France once proudly boasted of as the \"Pearl of the Antilles\" became independent as [[Haiti]] in 1804. Napoleon's ambition and public approval inspired him to go further, and he became the first Emperor of the French in 1804. Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the [[Ulm Campaign]] and a historic triumph over the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Austrian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]] took up arms against him because [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon quickly defeated Prussia at the [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], then marched his ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' deep into [[Eastern Europe]] and annihilated the Russians in June 1807 at the [[Battle of Friedland]]. France then forced the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to sign the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in July 1807, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent. Tilsit signified the high-water mark of the French Empire. In 1809, the Austrians and the British challenged the French again during the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]], but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the [[Battle of Wagram]] in July.\n\nNapoleon then [[Napoleonic invasion of Iberia|occupied the Iberian Peninsula]], hoping to extend the [[Continental System]] and choke off British trade with the European mainland, and declared his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] the [[King of Spain]] in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The [[Peninsular War]] lasted six years, featured extensive [[guerrilla warfare]], and ended in victory for the Allies against Napoleon. The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its client states, especially Russia. The Russians were unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade and routinely violated the Continental System, enticing Napoleon into another war. The French launched a major [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in the summer of 1812. The campaign destroyed Russian cities, but did not yield the decisive victory Napoleon wanted. It resulted in the collapse of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] against France. A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, but his tactical victory at the minor [[Battle of Hanau]] allowed retreat onto French soil. The Allies then [[1814 campaign in France|invaded France]] and captured Paris in the spring of 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was exiled to the island of [[Elba]] off the coast of [[Tuscany]], and the [[Bourbon dynasty]] was [[Bourbon Restoration|restored to power]]. Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again. The Allies responded by forming a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh Coalition]] which defeated him at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June. The British exiled him to the remote island of [[Saint Helena]] in the South Atlantic, where he died six years later at the age of 51.\n\nNapoleon's influence on the modern world brought liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled, such as the [[Low Countries]], [[Switzerland]], and large parts of modern [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe. His [[Napoleonic Code]] has influenced the legal systems of more than 70 nations around the world. British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] states: \"The ideas that underpin our modern world\u2014meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on\u2014were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them he added a rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]\".<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014), p. xxxiii.</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Carlo Buonaparte.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Half-length portrait of a wigged middle-aged man with a well-to-do jacket.

With the help of his fellow Corsican [[Antoine Christophe Saliceti]], Bonaparte was appointed artillery commander of the republican forces at the Siege of Toulon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=132}}</ref>\n\nHe adopted a plan to capture a hill where republican guns could dominate the city's harbour and force the British to evacuate. The assault on the position led to the capture of the city, but during it Bonaparte was wounded in the thigh. He was promoted to [[brigadier general (France)|brigadier general]] at the age of 24.

From Ormea, they headed west to outflank the Austro-Sardinian positions around [[Saorge]]. After this campaign, Augustin Robespierre sent Bonaparte on a mission to the [[Republic of Genoa]] to determine that country's intentions towards France.<ref>Patrice Gueniffey, ''Bonaparte: 1769\u20131802'' (Harvard UP, 2015), pp. 137\u201359.</ref>\n\n=== 13 Vend\u00e9miaire (1794) ===\n{{Main|13 Vend\u00e9miaire}}\nSome contemporaries alleged that Bonaparte was put under [[house arrest]] at [[Nice]] for his association with the Robespierres following their fall in the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] in July 1794, but Napoleon's secretary [[Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne|Bourrienne]] disputed the allegation in his memoirs. According to Bourrienne, jealousy was responsible, between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy (with whom Napoleon was seconded at the time).<ref>Bourrienne, ''Memoirs of Napoleon'', p. 39</ref> Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defence in a letter to the commissar Saliceti, and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing.<ref>Bourrienne, ''Memoirs of Napoleon'', p. 38</ref> He was released within two weeks and, due to his technical skills, was asked to draw up plans to attack Italian positions in the context of France's war with Austria.

Murat married one of Napoleon's sisters, becoming his brother-in-law; he also served under Napoleon as one of his generals. Bonaparte was promoted to Commander of the Interior and given command of the Army of Italy.<ref name=\"rxviii\" />\n\nWithin weeks, he was romantically involved with [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]], the former mistress of Barras.

He immediately went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the forces of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]] before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a series of rapid victories during the [[Montenotte Campaign]], he knocked Piedmont out of the war in two weeks. The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of the war, the highlight of which became the protracted [[Siege of Mantua (1796\u201397)|struggle for Mantua]]. The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege, but Napoleon defeated every relief effort, scoring victories at the battles of [[Battle of Castiglione|Castiglione]], [[Battle of Bassano|Bassano]], [[Battle of Arcole|Arcole]], and [[Battle of Rivoli|Rivoli]]. The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy. At Rivoli, the Austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the French lost about 5,000.{{sfn|Bell|2015|p=29}}\n\nThe next phase of the campaign featured the French invasion of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heartlands. French forces in Southern Germany had been defeated by the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] in 1796, but the Archduke withdrew his forces to protect Vienna after learning about Napoleon's assault. In the first encounter between the two commanders, Napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning at the [[Battle of Tarvis (1797)|Battle of Tarvis]] in March 1797. The Austrians were alarmed by the French thrust that reached all the way to [[Leoben]], about 100&nbsp;km from Vienna, and finally decided to sue for peace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|pp=284\u201385}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Leoben]], followed by the more comprehensive [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], gave France control of most of northern Italy and the [[Low Countries]], and a secret clause promised the [[Republic of Venice]] to Austria. Bonaparte marched on Venice and forced its surrender, ending 1,100 years of independence. He also authorized the French to loot treasures such as the [[Horses of Saint Mark]].<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=132}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bonaparte re\u00e7oit les prisonniers sur le champ de bataille, 1797.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte during the Italian campaign in 1797]]\nHis application of conventional military ideas to real-world situations enabled his military triumphs, such as creative use of artillery as a mobile force to support his infantry. He stated later in life:{{When|date=August 2016}} \"I have fought sixty battles and I have learned nothing which I did not know at the beginning. Look at Caesar; he fought the first like the last\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=145}}</ref>\n\nBonaparte could win battles by concealment of troop deployments and concentration of his forces on the \"hinge\" of an enemy's weakened front. If he could not use his favourite [[Pincer movement|envelopment strategy]], he would take up the central position and attack two co-operating forces at their hinge, swing round to fight one until it fled, then turn to face the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=142}}</ref> In this Italian campaign, Bonaparte's army captured 150,000 prisoners, 540 cannons, and 170 [[flag|standards]].<ref>Harvey 2006, p. 179</ref> The French army fought 67 actions and won 18 [[pitched battle]]s through superior artillery technology and Bonaparte's tactics.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=135}}</ref>\n\nDuring the campaign, Bonaparte became increasingly influential in French politics. He founded two newspapers: one for the troops in his army and another for circulation in France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=306}}</ref> The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=305}}</ref> Napoleon's forces extracted an estimated $45&nbsp;million in funds from Italy during their campaign there, another $12&nbsp;million in precious metals and jewels.

Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, he decided to strike first and turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the [[Rhine]]. His basic objective was to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could arrive.

The [[Ulm Campaign|Ulm Maneuver]] completely surprised General Mack, who belatedly understood that his army had been cut off. After some minor engagements that culminated in the [[Battle of Ulm]], Mack finally surrendered after realizing that there was no way to break out of the French encirclement.

At the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], in [[Moravia]] on 2 December, he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Marshal Davout]] and his [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]] plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right flank weakened their center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the [[IV Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|IV Corps]] of [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]]. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process.

France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]] and of [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville|Lun\u00e9ville]] between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40&nbsp;million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil.

The brazen reorganisation of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright.

As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated the Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties. With several major commanders dead or incapacitated, the Prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army, which began to quickly disintegrate.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nIn a vaunted pursuit that epitomized the \"peak of Napoleonic warfare\", according to historian Richard Brooks,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> the French managed to capture 140,000 soldiers, over 2,000 cannons and hundreds of ammunition wagons, all in a single month. Historian David Chandler wrote of the Prussian forces: \"Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered\".<ref name=\"Chandler 1966, p. 467-8\" /> Despite their overwhelming defeat, the Prussians refused to negotiate with the French until the Russians had an opportunity to enter the fight.\n\n[[File:Tilsitz 1807.JPG|thumb|Napoleon meeting with [[Alexander I of Russia]] on a raft in the middle of the [[Neman|Nieman River]] during the [[Treaties of Tilsit]]]]\n\nFollowing his triumph, Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the [[Berlin Decree]] issued in November 1806.

The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French. On 19 June, Tsar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon. The latter assured the envoy that the [[Vistula River]] represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe. On that basis, the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]] after meeting on an iconic raft on the [[Neman (river)|River Niemen]]. The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated: \"I hate the English as much as you do\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nAlexander faced pressure from his brother, [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Duke Constantine]], to make peace with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms\u2014demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], and hand over the [[Ionian Islands]] to France.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=458\u201359}} By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]]. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of {{convert|1100|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} called [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and appointed his young brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me as its monarch. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the [[Napoleonic era]] progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=459\u201361}}\n\n==== Peninsular War and Erfurt (1807-1808) ====\n{{Main|Peninsular War}}\nThe settlements at Tilsit gave Napoleon time to organise his empire. One of his major objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the [[War of the Oranges]] in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Joseph-Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's brother, as King of Spain]]\n\nUnhappy with this change of policy by the Portuguese government, Napoleon negotiated a [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|secret treaty]] with [[Charles IV of Spain]] and sent an army to invade Portugal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Horne |first=Alistair |author-link=Alistair Horne |title=How Far From Austerlitz?

Napoleon appointed his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808. The appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative Spanish population. Resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout Spain. The shocking French defeat at the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nBefore going to Iberia, Napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the Russians. At the [[Congress of Erfurt]] in October 1808, Napoleon hoped to keep Russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in Spain and during any potential conflict against Austria. The two sides reached an agreement, the Erfurt Convention, that called upon Britain to cease its war against France, that recognized the Russian conquest of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]] from [[Kingdom of Sweden (1721\u20131809)|Sweden]], and that affirmed Russian support for France in a possible war against Austria \"to the best of its ability\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |title=The Erfurt Convention 1808 |publisher=Napoleon-series.org |accessdate=22 April 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021094131/http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |archivedate=21 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\nNapoleon then returned to France and prepared for war. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', under the Emperor's personal command, rapidly crossed the [[Ebro]] River in November 1808 and inflicted a series of crushing defeats against the Spanish forces. After clearing the last Spanish force guarding the capital at [[Battle of Somosierra|Somosierra]], Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80,000 troops.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 205.</ref> He then unleashed his soldiers against [[John Moore (British soldier)|Moore]] and the British forces.

He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. Several months after Corunna, the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. The war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand. The highlight of the conflict became the brutal ''[[guerrilla warfare]]'' that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside. Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during this phase of the conflict.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|pp=659\u201360}}</ref>\n\nThe vicious guerrilla fighting in Spain, largely absent from the French campaigns in Central Europe, severely disrupted the French lines of supply and communication. Although France maintained roughly 300,000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War, the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively, prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in favour of the Allies. After the invasion of Russia in 1812, the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe. By 1814, after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia, the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe impact of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain and ousting of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy in favour of his brother Joseph had an enormous impact on the [[Spanish empire]]. In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch. The outbreak of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain and led to the rise of [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] in the wake of these wars.<ref>[[John Lynch (historian)|John Lynch]], ''Caudillos in Spanish America 1800\u20131850''.

The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion.

On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]].

Over 4000 British troops were lost in a bungled campaign, and the rest withdrew in December 1809.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_walcheren.html|title=The British Expeditionary Force to Walcheren: 1809|publisher=napoleon-series.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144402/http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_walcheren.html|archivedate=18 July 2011}}</ref> The main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the French and the Austrians. Emperor Francis wanted to wait and see how the British performed in their theatre before entering into negotiations with Napoleon. Once it became apparent that the British were going nowhere, the Austrians agreed to peace talks.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe resulting [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] in October 1809 was the harshest that France had imposed on Austria in recent memory.

[[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Empress Jos\u00e9phine]] had still not given birth to a child from Napoleon, who became worried about the future of his empire following his death. Desperate for a legitimate heir, Napoleon divorced Jos\u00e9phine on 10 January 1810 and started looking for a new wife. Hoping to cement the recent alliance with Austria through a family connection, Napoleon married the [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], daughter of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who was 18 years old at the time. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to a baby boy, whom Napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of ''[[King of the Romans|King of Rome]]''. His son never actually ruled the empire, but given his brief titular rule and cousin Louis-Napol\u00e9on's subsequent naming himself Napol\u00e9on III, historians often refer to him as ''[[Napoleon II]]''.<ref>David Watkin, ''The Roman Forum''.

Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created. This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen. Napoleon refused to [[manumission|manumit]] the Russian [[serf]]s because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|pp=504\u201305}}</ref>\n\nThe Russians avoided Napoleon's objective of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance was made at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] in August; the Russians were defeated in a series of battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's [[scorched earth]] tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses.<ref>Harvey 2006, p. 773</ref>\n\nThe Russians eventually offered battle outside Moscow on 7 September: the [[Battle of Borodino]] resulted in approximately 44,000 Russian and 35,000 French dead, wounded or captured, and may have been the bloodiest day of battle in history up to that point in time.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=518}}</ref> Although the French had won, the Russian army had accepted, and withstood, the major battle Napoleon had hoped would be decisive.

The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory, but the Russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible\".<ref>Markham 1988, p. 194</ref>\n\nThe Russian army withdrew and retreated past Moscow. Napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor [[Feodor Rostopchin]], rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the [[Malet coup of 1812]]. His army walked through snow up to their knees, and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 November alone. After the [[Battle of Berezina]] Napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train.

Napoleon would remain as Emperor of France, but it would be reduced to its \"natural frontiers\". That meant that France could retain control of Belgium, Savoy and the Rhineland (the west bank of the Rhine River), while giving up control of all the rest, including all of Spain and the Netherlands, and most of Italy and Germany. Metternich told Napoleon these were the best terms the Allies were likely to offer; after further victories, the terms would be harsher and harsher. Metternich's motivation was to maintain France as a balance against Russian threats, while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars.<ref name=\"J. P.

His description of Napoleon in the months before his death led [[Sten Forshufvud]] in a 1961 paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate [[arsenic poisoning]].<ref name=Cullen>Cullen 2008, pp. 146\u201348</ref> Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Furthermore, in a 1978 book with [[Ben Weider]], Forshufvud noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of [[orgeat syrup]] that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.<ref name=Cullen />\n\nThey maintained that the [[potassium tartrate]] used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was a symptom of the poison. Their hypothesis was that the [[calomel]] given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage behind.<ref name=Cullen /> According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.<ref name=cullen156>Cullen 2008, p. 156</ref>\n\nThere have been modern studies that have supported the original autopsy finding.<ref name=cullen156 /> In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 times higher than the current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives.{{Efn|The body can tolerate large doses of arsenic if ingested regularly, and arsenic was a fashionable [[Panacea (medicine)|cure-all]].<ref>Cullen 2008, p. 50</ref>}} Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of [[peptic ulcer]] and [[gastric cancer]] as the cause of death.<ref>Cullen 2008, p. 161, and Hindmarsh et al. 2008, p. 2092</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Further|Napoleon and the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:France dioceses 1801.svg|thumb|right|Reorganisation of the religious geography: France is divided into 59 [[diocese]]s and 10 [[ecclesiastical provinces]].]]\n\nNapoleon was baptised in [[Ajaccio]] on 21 July 1771.

It solidified the Roman Catholic Church as the majority church of France and brought back most of its civil status. The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had now largely been resolved. The Concordat did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off. As a part of the Concordat, Napoleon presented another set of laws called the [[Organic Articles]].<ref>William Roberts, \"Napoleon, the Concordat of 1801, and Its Consequences\". in by Frank J.

It is more likely that he was {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}, the height he was measured at on St. Helena (a British island), since he would have most likely been measured with an English yardstick rather than a yardstick of the Old French Regime.<ref name=\"Owen Connelly 2006 7\"/> Napoleon surrounded himself with tall bodyguards and was affectionately nicknamed ''le petit caporal'' (the little corporal), reflecting his reported camaraderie with his soldiers rather than his height.\n\nWhen he became First Consul and later Emperor, Napoleon eschewed his general's uniform and habitually wore the green colonel uniform (non-Hussar) of a colonel of the [[Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale|Chasseur \u00e0 Cheval of the Imperial Guard]], the regiment that served as his personal escort many times, with a large [[bicorne]]. He also habitually wore (usually on Sundays) the blue uniform of a colonel of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] Foot Grenadiers (blue with white facings and red cuffs). He also wore his [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] star, medal and ribbon, and the [[Order of the Iron Crown]] decorations, white French-style [[culotte]]s and white stockings. This was in contrast to the complex uniforms with many decorations of his [[Marshal of the Empire|marshals]] and those around him.\n\nIn his later years he gained quite a bit of weight and had a complexion considered pale or sallow, something contemporaries took note of. Novelist Paul de Kock, who saw him in 1811 on the balcony of the Tuileries, called Napoleon \"yellow, obese, and bloated\".<ref>Seward, Desmond. ''Napoleon's Family''. New York: Viking, 1986.</ref> A British captain who met him in 1815 stated \"I felt very much disappointed, as I believe everyone else did, in his appearance&nbsp;... He is fat, rather what we call pot-bellied, and although his leg is well shaped, it is rather clumsy&nbsp;... He is very sallow, with light grey eyes, and rather thin, greasy-looking brown hair, and altogether a very nasty, priestlike-looking fellow.\"<ref>The Bookman, Vol. 29, p. 304. Diary of Capt. Ross, commander of the Northumberland.</ref>\n\nThe [[stock character]] of Napoleon is a comically short \"petty tyrant\" and this has become a clich\u00e9 in popular culture. He is often portrayed wearing a large [[bicorne]] hat with a [[hand-in-waistcoat]] gesture\u2014a reference to the painting produced in 1812 by Jacques-Louis David.{{sfn|Bordes|2007|p=118}} In 1908 [[Alfred Adler]], a psychologist, cited Napoleon to describe an [[inferiority complex]] in which short people adopt an over-aggressive behaviour to compensate for lack of height; this inspired the term ''[[Napoleon complex]]''.<ref>Hall 2006, p. 181</ref>\n\n== Reforms ==\n[[File:Debret - Premiere distribution des decorations de la Legion d'honneur.jpg|thumb|right|First remittance of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur, 15 July 1804, at [[Les Invalides|Saint-Louis des Invalides]], by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]] (1812)]]\n\nNapoleon instituted various reforms, such as higher education, a [[tax code]], road and sewer systems, and established the [[Banque de France]], the first central bank in French history. He negotiated the [[Concordat of 1801]] with the Catholic Church, which sought to reconcile the mostly Catholic population to his regime. It was presented alongside the [[Organic Articles]], which regulated public worship in France. He dissolved the [[Holy Roman Empire]] prior to [[German Unification]] later in the 19th century.

Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] that revised the drafts. The development of the code was a fundamental change in the nature of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal system with its stress on clearly written and accessible law. Other codes (\"[[Les cinq codes]]\") were commissioned by Napoleon to codify criminal and commerce law; a Code of Criminal Instruction was published, which enacted rules of [[due process]].<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=255}}</ref>\n\nThe Napoleonic code was adopted throughout much of Continental Europe, though only in the lands he conquered, and remained in force after Napoleon's defeat.

Napoleon reorganised what had been the Holy Roman Empire, made up of more than a thousand entities, {{Quantify|date=August 2016}} into a more streamlined forty-state [[Confederation of the Rhine]]; this helped promote the [[German Confederation]] and the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871.<ref>Scheck 2008, Chapter: The Road to National Unification</ref>\n\nThe movement toward national unification in Italy was similarly precipitated by Napoleonic rule.<ref>Astarita 2005, p. 264</ref> These changes contributed to the development of nationalism and the [[nation state]].<ref>Alter 2006, pp. 61\u201376</ref>\n\nNapoleon implemented a wide array of liberal reforms in France and across Continental Europe, especially in Italy and Germany, as summarized by British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]]:\n\n{{quote|The ideas that underpin our modern world\u2014meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on\u2014were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon.

He continued the policy, which emerged from the Revolution, of promotion based primarily on merit.<ref name=Archer />\n\n[[Corps]] replaced divisions as the largest army units, [[Self-propelled artillery|mobile artillery]] was integrated into reserve batteries, the staff system became more fluid and cavalry returned as an important formation in French military doctrine.

The increased importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As a result of these factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |url-status=live |jstor=2677528 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119131512/http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |archive-date=19 January 2012|title=The Roots of Artillery Doctrine: Napoleonic Artillery Tactics Reconsidered |journal=The Journal of Military History |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=617\u2013640 |last1=McConachy |first1=Bruce |year=2001 |doi=10.2307/2677528 }}</ref> Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century [[operational mobility]] underwent change.<ref>Archer et al. 2002, p. 383</ref>\n\nNapoleon's biggest influence was in the conduct of warfare.

Invasions of enemy territory occurred over broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive. The political effect of war increased; defeat for a European power meant more than the loss of isolated enclaves.

He was [[Emperor of the French]] as '''Napoleon I''' from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]]. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a [[First French Empire|large empire]] that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.<ref name=\"Roberts, Andrew 2014\">Roberts, Andrew. ''Napoleon: A Life''.

He was serving as an artillery officer in the French army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789. He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military, seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24. The [[French Directory]] eventually gave him command of the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] after he suppressed the [[13 Vend\u00e9miaire]] revolt against the government from royalist insurgents. At age 26, he began his [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|first military campaign]] against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs\u2014winning virtually every battle, conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing \"[[sister republic]]s\" with local support, and becoming a war hero in France. In 1798, he led a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|military expedition to Egypt]] that served as a springboard to political power. He orchestrated a [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup in November 1799]] and became [[French Consulate|First Consul]] of the Republic. After the Peace of Amiens in 1802, Napoleon turned his attention to France's colonies. He sold the [[Louisiana Territory]] to the United States, and he attempted to restore slavery to the French Caribbean colonies. However, while he was successful in restoring slavery in the eastern Caribbean, Napoleon failed in his attempts to subdue [[Saint-Domingue]], and the colony that France once proudly boasted of as the \"Pearl of the Antilles\" became independent as [[Haiti]] in 1804. Napoleon's ambition and public approval inspired him to go further, and he became the first Emperor of the French in 1804. Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the [[Ulm Campaign]] and a historic triumph over the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Austrian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]] took up arms against him because [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon quickly defeated Prussia at the [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], then marched his ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' deep into [[Eastern Europe]] and annihilated the Russians in June 1807 at the [[Battle of Friedland]]. France then forced the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to sign the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in July 1807, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent. Tilsit signified the high-water mark of the French Empire. In 1809, the Austrians and the British challenged the French again during the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]], but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the [[Battle of Wagram]] in July.\n\nNapoleon then [[Napoleonic invasion of Iberia|occupied the Iberian Peninsula]], hoping to extend the [[Continental System]] and choke off British trade with the European mainland, and declared his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] the [[King of Spain]] in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The [[Peninsular War]] lasted six years, featured extensive [[guerrilla warfare]], and ended in victory for the Allies against Napoleon. The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its client states, especially Russia. The Russians were unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade and routinely violated the Continental System, enticing Napoleon into another war. The French launched a major [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in the summer of 1812. The campaign destroyed Russian cities, but did not yield the decisive victory Napoleon wanted. It resulted in the collapse of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] against France. A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, but his tactical victory at the minor [[Battle of Hanau]] allowed retreat onto French soil. The Allies then [[1814 campaign in France|invaded France]] and captured Paris in the spring of 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was exiled to the island of [[Elba]] off the coast of [[Tuscany]], and the [[Bourbon dynasty]] was [[Bourbon Restoration|restored to power]]. Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again. The Allies responded by forming a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh Coalition]] which defeated him at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June. The British exiled him to the remote island of [[Saint Helena]] in the South Atlantic, where he died six years later at the age of 51.\n\nNapoleon's influence on the modern world brought liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled, such as the [[Low Countries]], [[Switzerland]], and large parts of modern [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe. His [[Napoleonic Code]] has influenced the legal systems of more than 70 nations around the world. British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] states: \"The ideas that underpin our modern world\u2014meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on\u2014were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them he added a rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]\".<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014), p. xxxiii.</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Carlo Buonaparte.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Half-length portrait of a wigged middle-aged man with a well-to-do jacket.

With the help of his fellow Corsican [[Antoine Christophe Saliceti]], Bonaparte was appointed artillery commander of the republican forces at the Siege of Toulon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=132}}</ref>\n\nHe adopted a plan to capture a hill where republican guns could dominate the city's harbour and force the British to evacuate. The assault on the position led to the capture of the city, but during it Bonaparte was wounded in the thigh. He was promoted to [[brigadier general (France)|brigadier general]] at the age of 24.

From Ormea, they headed west to outflank the Austro-Sardinian positions around [[Saorge]]. After this campaign, Augustin Robespierre sent Bonaparte on a mission to the [[Republic of Genoa]] to determine that country's intentions towards France.<ref>Patrice Gueniffey, ''Bonaparte: 1769\u20131802'' (Harvard UP, 2015), pp. 137\u201359.</ref>\n\n=== 13 Vend\u00e9miaire (1794) ===\n{{Main|13 Vend\u00e9miaire}}\nSome contemporaries alleged that Bonaparte was put under [[house arrest]] at [[Nice]] for his association with the Robespierres following their fall in the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] in July 1794, but Napoleon's secretary [[Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne|Bourrienne]] disputed the allegation in his memoirs. According to Bourrienne, jealousy was responsible, between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy (with whom Napoleon was seconded at the time).<ref>Bourrienne, ''Memoirs of Napoleon'', p. 39</ref> Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defence in a letter to the commissar Saliceti, and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing.<ref>Bourrienne, ''Memoirs of Napoleon'', p. 38</ref> He was released within two weeks and, due to his technical skills, was asked to draw up plans to attack Italian positions in the context of France's war with Austria.

Murat married one of Napoleon's sisters, becoming his brother-in-law; he also served under Napoleon as one of his generals. Bonaparte was promoted to Commander of the Interior and given command of the Army of Italy.<ref name=\"rxviii\" />\n\nWithin weeks, he was romantically involved with [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]], the former mistress of Barras.

He immediately went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the forces of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]] before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a series of rapid victories during the [[Montenotte Campaign]], he knocked Piedmont out of the war in two weeks. The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of the war, the highlight of which became the protracted [[Siege of Mantua (1796\u201397)|struggle for Mantua]]. The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege, but Napoleon defeated every relief effort, scoring victories at the battles of [[Battle of Castiglione|Castiglione]], [[Battle of Bassano|Bassano]], [[Battle of Arcole|Arcole]], and [[Battle of Rivoli|Rivoli]]. The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy. At Rivoli, the Austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the French lost about 5,000.{{sfn|Bell|2015|p=29}}\n\nThe next phase of the campaign featured the French invasion of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heartlands. French forces in Southern Germany had been defeated by the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] in 1796, but the Archduke withdrew his forces to protect Vienna after learning about Napoleon's assault. In the first encounter between the two commanders, Napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning at the [[Battle of Tarvis (1797)|Battle of Tarvis]] in March 1797. The Austrians were alarmed by the French thrust that reached all the way to [[Leoben]], about 100&nbsp;km from Vienna, and finally decided to sue for peace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|pp=284\u201385}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Leoben]], followed by the more comprehensive [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], gave France control of most of northern Italy and the [[Low Countries]], and a secret clause promised the [[Republic of Venice]] to Austria. Bonaparte marched on Venice and forced its surrender, ending 1,100 years of independence. He also authorized the French to loot treasures such as the [[Horses of Saint Mark]].<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=132}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bonaparte re\u00e7oit les prisonniers sur le champ de bataille, 1797.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte during the Italian campaign in 1797]]\nHis application of conventional military ideas to real-world situations enabled his military triumphs, such as creative use of artillery as a mobile force to support his infantry. He stated later in life:{{When|date=August 2016}} \"I have fought sixty battles and I have learned nothing which I did not know at the beginning. Look at Caesar; he fought the first like the last\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=145}}</ref>\n\nBonaparte could win battles by concealment of troop deployments and concentration of his forces on the \"hinge\" of an enemy's weakened front. If he could not use his favourite [[Pincer movement|envelopment strategy]], he would take up the central position and attack two co-operating forces at their hinge, swing round to fight one until it fled, then turn to face the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=142}}</ref> In this Italian campaign, Bonaparte's army captured 150,000 prisoners, 540 cannons, and 170 [[flag|standards]].<ref>Harvey 2006, p. 179</ref> The French army fought 67 actions and won 18 [[pitched battle]]s through superior artillery technology and Bonaparte's tactics.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=135}}</ref>\n\nDuring the campaign, Bonaparte became increasingly influential in French politics. He founded two newspapers: one for the troops in his army and another for circulation in France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=306}}</ref> The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=305}}</ref> Napoleon's forces extracted an estimated $45 million in funds from Italy during their campaign there, another $12 million in precious metals and jewels.

On top of these forces, Napoleon created a [[cavalry]] reserve of 22,000 organised into two [[cuirassier]] [[Division (military)|divisions]], four mounted [[dragoon]] divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 [[artillery]] pieces.<ref name=\"Chandler p. 333\">{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=333}}</ref> By 1805, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' had grown to a force of 350,000 men,<ref name=\"Chandler p. 333\" /> who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.<ref>Michael J.

Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, he decided to strike first and turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the [[Rhine]]. His basic objective was to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could arrive.

The [[Ulm Campaign|Ulm Maneuver]] completely surprised General Mack, who belatedly understood that his army had been cut off. After some minor engagements that culminated in the [[Battle of Ulm]], Mack finally surrendered after realizing that there was no way to break out of the French encirclement.

At the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], in [[Moravia]] on 2 December, he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Marshal Davout]] and his [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]] plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right flank weakened their center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the [[IV Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|IV Corps]] of [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]]. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process. The battle is often seen as a tactical masterpiece because of the near-perfect execution of a calibrated but dangerous plan\u2014of the same stature as [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], the celebrated triumph by [[Hannibal]] some 2,000 years before.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Allied disaster at Austerlitz significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]] and of [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville|Lun\u00e9ville]] between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil.

The brazen reorganisation of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright.

As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated the Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties. With several major commanders dead or incapacitated, the Prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army, which began to quickly disintegrate.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nIn a vaunted pursuit that epitomized the \"peak of Napoleonic warfare\", according to historian Richard Brooks,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> the French managed to capture 140,000 soldiers, over 2,000 cannons and hundreds of ammunition wagons, all in a single month. Historian David Chandler wrote of the Prussian forces: \"Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered\".<ref name=\"Chandler 1966, p. 467-8\" /> Despite their overwhelming defeat, the Prussians refused to negotiate with the French until the Russians had an opportunity to enter the fight.\n\n[[File:Tilsitz 1807.JPG|thumb|Napoleon meeting with [[Alexander I of Russia]] on a raft in the middle of the [[Neman|Nieman River]] during the [[Treaties of Tilsit]]]]\n\nFollowing his triumph, Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the [[Berlin Decree]] issued in November 1806.

The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French. On 19 June, Tsar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon. The latter assured the envoy that the [[Vistula River]] represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe. On that basis, the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]] after meeting on an iconic raft on the [[Neman (river)|River Niemen]]. The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated: \"I hate the English as much as you do\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nAlexander faced pressure from his brother, [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Duke Constantine]], to make peace with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms\u2014demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], and hand over the [[Ionian Islands]] to France.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=458\u201359}} By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]]. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of {{convert|1100|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} called [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and appointed his young brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me as its monarch. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the [[Napoleonic era]] progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=459\u201361}}\n\n==== Peninsular War and Erfurt (1807-1808) ====\n{{Main|Peninsular War}}\nThe settlements at Tilsit gave Napoleon time to organise his empire. One of his major objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the [[War of the Oranges]] in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Joseph-Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's brother, as King of Spain]]\n\nUnhappy with this change of policy by the Portuguese government, Napoleon negotiated a [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|secret treaty]] with [[Charles IV of Spain]] and sent an army to invade Portugal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Horne |first=Alistair |author-link=Alistair Horne |title=How Far From Austerlitz?

Napoleon appointed his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808. The appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative Spanish population. Resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout Spain. The shocking French defeat at the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nBefore going to Iberia, Napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the Russians. At the [[Congress of Erfurt]] in October 1808, Napoleon hoped to keep Russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in Spain and during any potential conflict against Austria. The two sides reached an agreement, the Erfurt Convention, that called upon Britain to cease its war against France, that recognized the Russian conquest of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]] from [[Kingdom of Sweden (1721\u20131809)|Sweden]], and that affirmed Russian support for France in a possible war against Austria \"to the best of its ability\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |title=The Erfurt Convention 1808 |publisher=Napoleon-series.org |accessdate=22 April 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021094131/http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |archivedate=21 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\nNapoleon then returned to France and prepared for war. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', under the Emperor's personal command, rapidly crossed the [[Ebro]] River in November 1808 and inflicted a series of crushing defeats against the Spanish forces. After clearing the last Spanish force guarding the capital at [[Battle of Somosierra|Somosierra]], Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80,000 troops.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 205.</ref> He then unleashed his soldiers against [[John Moore (British soldier)|Moore]] and the British forces.

He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. Several months after Corunna, the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. The war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand. The highlight of the conflict became the brutal ''[[guerrilla warfare]]'' that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside. Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during this phase of the conflict.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|pp=659\u201360}}</ref>\n\nThe vicious guerrilla fighting in Spain, largely absent from the French campaigns in Central Europe, severely disrupted the French lines of supply and communication. Although France maintained roughly 300,000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War, the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively, prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in favour of the Allies. After the invasion of Russia in 1812, the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe. By 1814, after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia, the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe impact of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain and ousting of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy in favour of his brother Joseph had an enormous impact on the [[Spanish empire]]. In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch. The outbreak of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain and led to the rise of [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] in the wake of these wars.<ref>[[John Lynch (historian)|John Lynch]], ''Caudillos in Spanish America 1800\u20131850''.

The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion.

On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]].

Over 4000 British troops were lost in a bungled campaign, and the rest withdrew in December 1809.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_walcheren.html|title=The British Expeditionary Force to Walcheren: 1809|publisher=napoleon-series.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144402/http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_walcheren.html|archivedate=18 July 2011}}</ref> The main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the French and the Austrians. Emperor Francis wanted to wait and see how the British performed in their theatre before entering into negotiations with Napoleon. Once it became apparent that the British were going nowhere, the Austrians agreed to peace talks.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe resulting [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] in October 1809 was the harshest that France had imposed on Austria in recent memory.

[[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Empress Jos\u00e9phine]] had still not given birth to a child from Napoleon, who became worried about the future of his empire following his death. Desperate for a legitimate heir, Napoleon divorced Jos\u00e9phine on 10 January 1810 and started looking for a new wife. Hoping to cement the recent alliance with Austria through a family connection, Napoleon married the [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], daughter of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who was 18 years old at the time. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to a baby boy, whom Napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of ''[[King of the Romans|King of Rome]]''. His son never actually ruled the empire, but given his brief titular rule and cousin Louis-Napol\u00e9on's subsequent naming himself Napol\u00e9on III, historians often refer to him as ''[[Napoleon II]]''.<ref>David Watkin, ''The Roman Forum''.

Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created. This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen. Napoleon refused to [[manumission|manumit]] the Russian [[serf]]s because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|pp=504\u201305}}</ref>\n\nThe Russians avoided Napoleon's objective of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance was made at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] in August; the Russians were defeated in a series of battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's [[scorched earth]] tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses.<ref>Harvey 2006, p. 773</ref>\n\nThe Russians eventually offered battle outside Moscow on 7 September: the [[Battle of Borodino]] resulted in approximately 44,000 Russian and 35,000 French dead, wounded or captured, and may have been the bloodiest day of battle in history up to that point in time.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=518}}</ref> Although the French had won, the Russian army had accepted, and withstood, the major battle Napoleon had hoped would be decisive.

The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory, but the Russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible\".<ref>Markham 1988, p. 194</ref>\n\nThe Russian army withdrew and retreated past Moscow. Napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor [[Feodor Rostopchin]], rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the [[Malet coup of 1812]]. His army walked through snow up to their knees, and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 November alone. After the [[Battle of Berezina]] Napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train.

Napoleon would remain as Emperor of France, but it would be reduced to its \"natural frontiers\". That meant that France could retain control of Belgium, Savoy and the Rhineland (the west bank of the Rhine River), while giving up control of all the rest, including all of Spain and the Netherlands, and most of Italy and Germany. Metternich told Napoleon these were the best terms the Allies were likely to offer; after further victories, the terms would be harsher and harsher. Metternich's motivation was to maintain France as a balance against Russian threats, while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars.<ref name=\"J. P.

His description of Napoleon in the months before his death led [[Sten Forshufvud]] in a 1961 paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate [[arsenic poisoning]].<ref name=Cullen>Cullen 2008, pp. 146\u201348</ref> Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Furthermore, in a 1978 book with [[Ben Weider]], Forshufvud noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of [[orgeat syrup]] that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.<ref name=Cullen />\n\nThey maintained that the [[potassium tartrate]] used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was a symptom of the poison. Their hypothesis was that the [[calomel]] given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage behind.<ref name=Cullen /> According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.<ref name=cullen156>Cullen 2008, p. 156</ref>\n\nThere have been modern studies that have supported the original autopsy finding.<ref name=cullen156 /> In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 times higher than the current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives.{{Efn|The body can tolerate large doses of arsenic if ingested regularly, and arsenic was a fashionable [[Panacea (medicine)|cure-all]].<ref>Cullen 2008, p. 50</ref>}} Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of [[peptic ulcer]] and [[gastric cancer]] as the cause of death.<ref>Cullen 2008, p. 161, and Hindmarsh et al. 2008, p. 2092</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Further|Napoleon and the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:France dioceses 1801.svg|thumb|right|Reorganisation of the religious geography: France is divided into 59 [[diocese]]s and 10 [[ecclesiastical provinces]].]]\n\nNapoleon was baptised in [[Ajaccio]] on 21 July 1771.

It solidified the Roman Catholic Church as the majority church of France and brought back most of its civil status. The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had now largely been resolved. The Concordat did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off. As a part of the Concordat, Napoleon presented another set of laws called the [[Organic Articles]].<ref>William Roberts, \"Napoleon, the Concordat of 1801, and Its Consequences\". in by Frank J.

It is more likely that he was {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}, the height he was measured at on St. Helena (a British island), since he would have most likely been measured with an English yardstick rather than a yardstick of the Old French Regime.<ref name=\"Owen Connelly 2006 7\"/> Napoleon surrounded himself with tall bodyguards and was affectionately nicknamed ''le petit caporal'' (the little corporal), reflecting his reported camaraderie with his soldiers rather than his height.\n\nWhen he became First Consul and later Emperor, Napoleon eschewed his general's uniform and habitually wore the green colonel uniform (non-Hussar) of a colonel of the [[Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale|Chasseur \u00e0 Cheval of the Imperial Guard]], the regiment that served as his personal escort many times, with a large [[bicorne]]. He also habitually wore (usually on Sundays) the blue uniform of a colonel of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] Foot Grenadiers (blue with white facings and red cuffs). He also wore his [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] star, medal and ribbon, and the [[Order of the Iron Crown]] decorations, white French-style [[culotte]]s and white stockings. This was in contrast to the complex uniforms with many decorations of his [[Marshal of the Empire|marshals]] and those around him.\n\nIn his later years he gained quite a bit of weight and had a complexion considered pale or sallow, something contemporaries took note of. Novelist Paul de Kock, who saw him in 1811 on the balcony of the Tuileries, called Napoleon \"yellow, obese, and bloated\".<ref>Seward, Desmond. ''Napoleon's Family''. New York: Viking, 1986.</ref> A British captain who met him in 1815 stated \"I felt very much disappointed, as I believe everyone else did, in his appearance&nbsp;... He is fat, rather what we call pot-bellied, and although his leg is well shaped, it is rather clumsy&nbsp;... He is very sallow, with light grey eyes, and rather thin, greasy-looking brown hair, and altogether a very nasty, priestlike-looking fellow.\"<ref>The Bookman, Vol. 29, p. 304. Diary of Capt. Ross, commander of the Northumberland.</ref>\n\nThe [[stock character]] of Napoleon is a comically short \"petty tyrant\" and this has become a clich\u00e9 in popular culture. He is often portrayed wearing a large [[bicorne]] hat with a [[hand-in-waistcoat]] gesture\u2014a reference to the painting produced in 1812 by Jacques-Louis David.{{sfn|Bordes|2007|p=118}} In 1908 [[Alfred Adler]], a psychologist, cited Napoleon to describe an [[inferiority complex]] in which short people adopt an over-aggressive behaviour to compensate for lack of height; this inspired the term ''[[Napoleon complex]]''.<ref>Hall 2006, p. 181</ref>\n\n== Reforms ==\n[[File:Debret - Premiere distribution des decorations de la Legion d'honneur.jpg|thumb|right|First remittance of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur, 15 July 1804, at [[Les Invalides|Saint-Louis des Invalides]], by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]] (1812)]]\n\nNapoleon instituted various reforms, such as higher education, a [[tax code]], road and sewer systems, and established the [[Banque de France]], the first central bank in French history. He negotiated the [[Concordat of 1801]] with the Catholic Church, which sought to reconcile the mostly Catholic population to his regime. It was presented alongside the [[Organic Articles]], which regulated public worship in France. He dissolved the [[Holy Roman Empire]] prior to [[German Unification]] later in the 19th century.

Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] that revised the drafts. The development of the code was a fundamental change in the nature of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal system with its stress on clearly written and accessible law. Other codes (\"[[Les cinq codes]]\") were commissioned by Napoleon to codify criminal and commerce law; a Code of Criminal Instruction was published, which enacted rules of [[due process]].<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=255}}</ref>\n\nThe Napoleonic code was adopted throughout much of Continental Europe, though only in the lands he conquered, and remained in force after Napoleon's defeat.

Napoleon reorganised what had been the Holy Roman Empire, made up of more than a thousand entities, {{Quantify|date=August 2016}} into a more streamlined forty-state [[Confederation of the Rhine]]; this helped promote the [[German Confederation]] and the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871.<ref>Scheck 2008, Chapter: The Road to National Unification</ref>\n\nThe movement toward national unification in Italy was similarly precipitated by Napoleonic rule.<ref>Astarita 2005, p. 264</ref> These changes contributed to the development of nationalism and the [[nation state]].<ref>Alter 2006, pp. 61\u201376</ref>\n\nNapoleon implemented a wide array of liberal reforms in France and across Continental Europe, especially in Italy and Germany, as summarized by British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]]:\n\n{{quote|The ideas that underpin our modern world\u2014meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on\u2014were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon.

He continued the policy, which emerged from the Revolution, of promotion based primarily on merit.<ref name=Archer />\n\n[[Corps]] replaced divisions as the largest army units, [[Self-propelled artillery|mobile artillery]] was integrated into reserve batteries, the staff system became more fluid and cavalry returned as an important formation in French military doctrine.

The increased importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As a result of these factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |url-status=live |jstor=2677528 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119131512/http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |archive-date=19 January 2012|title=The Roots of Artillery Doctrine: Napoleonic Artillery Tactics Reconsidered |journal=The Journal of Military History |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=617\u2013640 |last1=McConachy |first1=Bruce |year=2001 |doi=10.2307/2677528 }}</ref> Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century [[operational mobility]] underwent change.<ref>Archer et al. 2002, p. 383</ref>\n\nNapoleon's biggest influence was in the conduct of warfare.

Invasions of enemy territory occurred over broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive. The political effect of war increased; defeat for a European power meant more than the loss of isolated enclaves.

It began with the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in 1937 in which a dispute between Japanese and Chinese troops escalated into a battle.

The period after [[World War I]] brought about increasing stress on the Japanese polity. Leftists sought universal suffrage and greater rights for workers. Increasing textile production from Chinese mills was adversely affecting Japanese production. The [[Great Depression]] brought about a large slowdown in exports. All of this contributed to militant [[nationalism]], culminating in the rise to power of a militarist faction. This faction was led at its height by the [[Hideki Tojo]] cabinet of the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] under edict from Emperor [[Hirohito]]. In 1931, the [[Mukden Incident]] helped spark the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]]. The Chinese were defeated and Japan created a new puppet state, [[Manchukuo]]; many historians cite 1931 as the beginning of the war.<ref name=\"Hotta2007\">{{cite book|last=Hotta|first=E.|title=Pan-Asianism and Japan's War 1931-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kih_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA75|date=25 December 2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-0-230-60992-1|page=40}}</ref><ref name=\"Paine2012\">{{cite book|last=Paine|first=S.

From 1931 to 1937, China and Japan continued to skirmish in small, localized engagements, so-called \"incidents\".\n\nFollowing the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Japanese scored major victories, capturing [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Beijing]], [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]] and the Chinese capital of [[Battle of Nanjing|Nanjing]] in 1937, which resulted in the [[Massacre of Nanjing|Rape of Nanjing]]. After failing to stop the Japanese in the [[Battle of Wuhan]], the Chinese central government was relocated to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking) in the Chinese interior. By 1939, after Chinese victories in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|Changsha]] and [[Battle of South Guangxi|Guangxi]], and with Japan's lines of communications stretched deep into the Chinese interior, the war reached a stalemate. The Japanese were also unable to defeat the Chinese communist forces in [[Shaanxi]], who waged a campaign of sabotage and guerrilla warfare against the invaders. While Japan ruled the large cities, they lacked sufficient manpower to control China's vast countryside. In November 1939, Chinese nationalist forces [[1939\u201340 Winter Offensive|launched a large scale winter offensive]], while in August 1940, Chinese communist forces [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|launched a counteroffensive]] in central China.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. The following day the [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|United States declared war on Japan]]. The United States began to aid China by airlifting material over [[the Hump|the Himalayas]] after the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] defeat in [[Japanese conquest of Burma|Burma]] that closed the [[Burma Road]]. In 1944, Japan launched the invasion, [[Operation Ichi-Go]], that conquered [[Henan]] and [[Changsha]]. However, this failed to bring about the surrender of Chinese forces. In 1945, the [[Chinese Expeditionary Force]] resumed [[Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan|its advance in Burma]] and completed the [[Ledo Road]] linking India to China. At the same time, China launched large counteroffensives in South China and [[Battle of West Hunan|retook West Hunan]] [[Second Guangxi Campaign|and Guangxi]].\n\nOn August 15, 1945, following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviet Union invasion of Japanese-held Manchuria]], Japan capitulated to Allied forces.  Japan continued to occupy part of China's territory until it formally [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered on September 2, 1945]]. The remaining Japanese occupation forces (excluding Manchuria) formally surrendered on September 9, 1945.\n\nAt the outcome of the [[Cairo Conference]] of November 22\u201326, 1943, the Allies of World War II had decided to restrain and punish the aggression of Japan by restoring all the territories that Japan annexed from China, including [[Manchuria]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[Pescadores]], to China, and to expel Japan from the [[Korean Peninsula]].

The conflicts were collectively known as the [[Jinan incident]] of 1928, during which time the Japanese military violently killed several Chinese officials and fired artillery shells into Jinan. Between 2,000 and 11,000 Chinese and Japanese civilians were believed to have been killed during these conflicts. Relations between the Chinese Nationalist government and Japan severely worsened as a result of the Jinan incident.{{sfn|Taylor|page=79}}{{sfn|Taylor|page=82}}\n\n===Reunification of China (1928)===\n{{Main|Chinese reunification (1928)}}\n\nAs the National Revolutionary Army approached Beijing, Zhang Zuolin decided to retreat back to Manchuria, before he was [[Huanggutun Incident|assassinated]] by the Kwantung Army in 1928.<ref>Boorman, Biographical Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 121</ref> His son, [[Zhang Xueliang]], took over as the leader of the Fengtian clique in Manchuria.

The Soviet [[Red Army]] victory over [[Zhang Xueliang]]'s forces not only reasserted Soviet control over the CER in Manchuria but revealed Chinese military weaknesses that Japanese Kwantung Army officers were quick to note.<ref>Michael M.

Manchuria was central to Japan's East Asia policy. Both the 1921 and 1927 Imperial Eastern Region Conferences reconfirmed Japan's commitment to be the dominant power in the Northeast. The 1929 Red Army victory shook that policy to the core and reopened the Manchurian problem. By 1930, the Kwantung Army realized they faced a Red Army that was only growing stronger. The time to act was drawing near and Japanese plans to conquer the Northeast were accelerated.<ref>Michael M.

The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) previously fought openly against the Nanjing government after the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]], and they continued to expand during this civil war. The Kuomintang government in Nanjing decided to focus their efforts on suppressing the Chinese Communists through the [[Encirclement Campaigns]], following the policy of \"first internal pacification, then external resistance\" ({{zh|c=\u6518\u5916\u5fc5\u5148\u5b89\u5167|links=no}}).\n\n==Prelude: invasion of Manchuria and Northern China==\n{{anchor|occupation}}\n[[File:Mukden 1931 japan shenyang.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese troops entering [[Shenyang]] during the [[Mukden Incident]]]]\n\nThe internecine warfare in China provided excellent opportunities for Japan, which saw Manchuria as a limitless supply of raw materials, a market for its manufactured goods (now excluded from the markets of many Western countries as a result of [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[tariff]]s), and a protective [[buffer state]] against the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Siberia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japan invaded Manchuria]] outright after the [[Mukden Incident]] in September 1931. Japan charged that its rights in Manchuria, which had been established as a result of its victory at the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], had been systematically violated and there were \"more than 120 cases of infringement of rights and interests, interference with business, boycott of Japanese goods, unreasonable taxation, detention of individuals, confiscation of properties, eviction, demand for cessation of business, assault and battery, and the oppression of Korean residents\".<ref>[http://ibiblio.org/pha/monos/144/144chap1.html POLITICAL STRATEGY PRIOR TO OUTBREAK OF WAR PART I] Japanese monograph No. 144</ref>\n\nAfter five months of fighting, Japan established the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932, and installed the last [[Emperor of China]], [[Puyi]], as its puppet ruler. Militarily too weak to challenge Japan directly, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. The League's investigation led to the publication of the [[Lytton Report]], condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, causing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. No country took action against Japan beyond tepid censure.\n\nIncessant fighting followed the Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought the [[January 28 Incident]] battle. This resulted in the [[demilitarisation]] of [[Shanghai]], which forbade the Chinese from deploying troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an [[Pacification of Manchukuo|ongoing campaign]] to defeat the [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies]] that arose from widespread outrage over the policy of non-resistance to Japan.\n[[File:Dadao map 1939.svg|thumb|260px|Japanese Empire's [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|territorial expansion]]]]\nIn 1933, the Japanese [[Defense of the Great Wall|attacked the Great Wall]] region. The [[Tanggu Truce]] established in its aftermath, gave Japan control of [[Rehe Province|Jehol]] province as well as a demilitarized zone between the Great Wall and Beiping-Tianjin region. Japan aimed to create another buffer zone between Manchukuo and the Chinese Nationalist government in [[Nanjing]].\n\nJapan increasingly exploited China's internal conflicts to reduce the strength of its fractious opponents. Even years after the [[Northern Expedition]], the political power of the Nationalist government was limited to just the area of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Other sections of China were essentially in the hands of local Chinese warlords. Japan sought various [[Hanjian|Chinese collaborators]] and helped them establish governments friendly to Japan. This policy was called the ''Specialization'' of [[North China]] ({{zh|c=\u83ef\u5317\u7279\u6b8a\u5316|p=hu\u00e1b\u011bit\u00e8sh\u016bh\u00f9a|links=no}}), more commonly known as the North China Autonomous Movement. The northern provinces affected by this policy were [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], [[Suiyuan]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], and [[Shandong]].\n\nThis Japanese policy was most effective in the area of what is now [[Inner Mongolia]] and Hebei. In 1935, under Japanese pressure, China signed the [[He\u2013Umezu Agreement]], which forbade the KMT from conducting party operations in Hebei. In the same year, the [[Chin\u2013Doihara Agreement]] was signed expelling the KMT from Chahar. Thus, by the end of 1935 the Chinese government had essentially abandoned northern China. In its place, the Japanese-backed [[East Hebei Autonomous Council]] and the [[Hebei\u2013Chahar Political Council]] were established. There in the empty space of Chahar the [[Mengjiang|Mongol Military Government]] was formed on May 12, 1936. Japan provided all the necessary military and economic aid. Afterwards Chinese volunteer forces continued to resist Japanese aggression [[Pacification of Manchukuo|in Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933\u20131936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].\n\n==Course of the war==\n\n===1937: Full-scale invasion of China===\n[[File:Jiangjieshi-declare.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] announced the [[Kuomintang]] policy of resistance against Japan at [[Lushan District|Lushan]] on July 10, 1937, three days after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]].]]\n\nOn the night of July 7, 1937, Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo (or Lugou) Bridge, a crucial access-route to Beijing. What began as confused, sporadic skirmishing soon escalated into a full-scale battle in which [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Beijing]] and its port city of Tianjin fell to Japanese forces (July\u2013August 1937). On July 29, some 5,000 troops of the 1st and 2nd Corps of the East Hopei Army mutinied, turning against the Japanese garrison. In addition to Japanese military personnel, some 260 civilians living in Tongzhou in accordance with the [[Boxer Protocol]] of 1901, were killed in the uprising (predominantly Japanese including the police force and also some ethnic Koreans). The Chinese then set fire to and destroyed much of the city. Only around 60 Japanese civilians survived, who provided both journalists and later historians with firsthand witness accounts. As a result of the violence of the mutiny against Japanese civilians, the [[Tungchow mutiny]], as it came to be called, strongly shook public opinion within Japan.\n\n===Battle of Shanghai===\n{{Main|Battle of Shanghai}}\n\n[[File:Shanghai1937IJA landing.jpg|thumb|Japanese landing near Shanghai, November 1937]]\n\nThe [[Imperial General Headquarters]] (GHQ) in Tokyo, content with the gains acquired in northern China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, initially showed reluctance to escalate the conflict into full-scale war. The KMT, however, determined that the \"breaking point\" of Japanese aggression had been reached. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] quickly mobilized the central government's army and [[Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937\u20131945)|air force]], placed them under his direct command, and laid siege to the Japanese area of [[Shanghai International Settlement]], where 30,000 Japanese civilians lived with 30,000 troops on August 12, 1937.\n\n[[File:Shanghai1937KMT machine gun nest.jpg|thumb|left|An NRA soldiers' machine gun nest in Shanghai]]\n\nOn August 13, 1937, [[Kuomintang]] soldiers and warplanes attacked [[Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces|Japanese Marine]] positions in Shanghai, leading to the [[Battle of Shanghai]].

They thought this would preserve strength for an anticipated showdown with the Soviet Union, but by now the Japanese government and GHQ had effectively lost control of the Japanese army in China. With many victories achieved, Japanese field generals [[Battle of Xuzhou|escalated the war in Jiangsu]] in an attempt to wipe out Chinese resistance, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]] (March\u2013April 1938). Afterwards the IJA changed its strategy and deployed almost all of its existing armies in China to attack the city of [[Wuhan]], which had become the political, economic and military center of rump China, in hopes of destroying the fighting strength of the [[National Revolutionary Army|NRA]] and of forcing the KMT government to negotiate for peace.{{sfn|Huang|page=168}} The Japanese [[Battle of Wuhan|captured Wuhan]] on October 27, 1938, forcing the KMT to retreat to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking), but Chiang Kai-shek still refused to negotiate, saying he would only consider talks if Japan agreed to withdraw to the pre-1937 borders. In 1937, the Japanese Imperial Army quickly marched into the heart of Chinese territory. On June 6, they captured Kaifeng, the capital of Henan, and threatened to take Zhengzhou, the junction of the Pinghan and Longhai railways. To prevent Japanese advances in western and southern China, Chiang Kai-shek, at the suggestion of Chen Guofu, ordered the opening of the dikes on the Yellow River near Zhengzhou. The original plan was to destroy the dike in Zhaokou, but due to difficulties in that place, the Huayuankou dike on the south bank was destroyed on June 5 and June 7 by excavation, with flood waters over Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The floods covered and destroyed thousands of square kilometers of agricultural land and displaced the mouth of the Yellow River hundreds of miles to the south. Thousands of villages were flooded or destroyed and several million villagers were expelled from their homes. About 800,000 drowned and an additional 10 million became refugees. Damage to plantations also affected the population which generated later hunger.\n\nWith Japanese casualties and costs mounting, the Imperial General Headquarters attempted to break Chinese resistance by ordering the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|air branches of their navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|army]] to launch the war's first [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Japanese bombing|massive air raids]] on civilian targets. Japanese raiders hit the Kuomintang's newly established [[Bombing of Chongqing|provisional capital of Chongqing]] and most other major cities in unoccupied China, leaving millions dead, injured, and homeless.\n\n===1939\u201340: Chinese counterattack and stalemate===\n[[File:Second Sino-Japanese War WW2.png|thumb|Map showing the extent of Japanese occupation in 1941 (in red)]]\n[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped)]]\n\nFrom the beginning of 1939, the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at [[Battle of Suixian\u2013Zaoyang]], [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1st Battle of Changsha]], [[Battle of South Guangxi]] and [[Battle of Zaoyi]]. These outcomes encouraged the Chinese to launch their first large-scale [[1939\u20131940 Winter Offensive|counter-offensive]] against the IJA in early 1940; however, due to its low military-industrial capacity and limited experience in [[modern warfare]], this offensive was defeated. Afterwards Chiang could not risk any more all-out offensive campaigns given the poorly trained, under-equipped, and disorganized state of his armies and opposition to his leadership both within the Kuomintang and in China in general. He had lost a substantial portion of his best trained and equipped troops in the [[Battle of Shanghai]] and was at times at the mercy of his generals, who maintained a high degree of autonomy from the central KMT government.\n\nDuring the offensive, Hui forces in Suiyuan under generals [[Ma Hongbin]] and [[Ma Buqing]] routed the Imperial Japanese Army and their puppet Inner Mongol forces and prevented the planned Japanese advance into northwest China. Ma Hongbin's father [[Ma Fulu]] had fought against Japanese in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. General [[Ma Biao (general)|Ma Biao]] led Hui, Salar and Dongxiang cavalry to defeat the Japanese at the [[Battle of Huaiyang]].<ref>[http://www.zk.ccoo.cn/news/local/3889814.html 8000\u9a91\u5175\u6218\u58eb\u6218\u6b7b\u6297\u65e5\u6c99\u573a\uff0c\u53ef\u6b4c\u53ef\u6ce3_\u5468\u53e3\u70ed\u70b9\u8d44\u8baf<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022054615/http://www.zk.ccoo.cn/news/local/3889814.html |date=October 22, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://qhmhmlc.blog.163.com/blog/static/294989642015824284687?suggestedreading|title=\u9752\u6d77\u516b\u5343\u4eba\u9a91\u5175\u5e08\u4e1c\u8fdb\u6297\u65e5 \u2013 \u6606\u4ed1\u7389\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7 \u2013 \u7f51\u6613\u535a\u5ba2|last=qhmhmlc,\u6606\u4ed1\u7389|work=163.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112172144/http://qhmhmlc.blog.163.com/blog/static/294989642015824284687?suggestedreading|archive-date=January 12, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://qh.people.com.cn/n/2015/0831/c181467-26189312.html|title=\u5188\u6751\u5b81\u6b21\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5728\u4f5c\u6218\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u5199\u4e0b\"\u6076\u6218\u9a6c\u5f6a\"--\u9752\u6d77\u9891\u9053--\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51|last=L_104241|work=people.com.cn|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yododo.com/area/photo/013EE3A4D9ED097BFF8080813EE2DC53|title=\u9a6c\u5f6a\uff081885\u2014\u2014... - \u5357\u660c\u7167\u7247 by \u5c71\u4e2d\u8001\u4eba\u5bb6|author=|date=|website=www.yododo.com|access-date=October 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112160043/http://www.yododo.com/area/photo/013EE3A4D9ED097BFF8080813EE2DC53|archive-date=January 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://m.qulishi.com/news/201411/20135.html \u9a6c\u6b65\u82b3\u519b\u961f\u6297\u6218\u7eaa\u5b9e\uff1a\u6297\u6218\u4e2d\u7684\u9a6c\u6b65\u82b3\u548c\u9a6c\u5bb6\u519b\uff01 -\u8da3\u5386\u53f2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimwww.com/html/2014/lishi_0421/23732.html|title=\u4e3a\u6297\u51fb\u65e5\u5bc7\u548c\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u4e2d\u56fd\u6d74\u8840\u594b\u6597\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u7a46\u65af\u6797 \u2013 \u5386\u53f2 \u2013 \u7a46\u65af\u6797\u5728\u7ebf-\u6253\u9020\u5168\u7403\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u4e2d\u6587\u95e8\u6237\u7f51\u7ad9(muslimwww)|work=muslimwww.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qulishi.com/news/201411/20135.html|title=\u9a6c\u6b65\u82b3\u519b\u961f\u6297\u6218\u7eaa\u5b9e\uff1a\u6297\u6218\u4e2d\u7684\u9a6c\u6b65\u82b3\u548c\u9a6c\u5bb6\u519b\uff01- \u8da3\u5386\u53f2|work=qulishi.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912090554/http://www.qulishi.com/news/201411/20135.html|archive-date=September 12, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.chinaislam.net.cn/cms/whyj/mmxm/zmrs/201412/14-7574.html \u8ba9\u65e5\u519b\u95fb\u98ce\u4e27\u80c6\u5730\u56de\u65cf\u6297\u65e5\u540d\u5c06<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702131936/http://www.chinaislam.net.cn/cms/whyj/mmxm/zmrs/201412/14-7574.html |date=July 2, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimwww.com/html/2013/lishi_0411/13152.html|title=\u8fd8\u539f\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u897f\u5317\u7fa4\u9a6c\u4e4b\u9a6c\u6b65\u82b3 \u9a91\u516b\u5e08\u4e2d\u539f\u6297\u65e5 \u2013 \u5386\u53f2 \u2013 \u7a46\u65af\u6797\u5728\u7ebf-\u6253\u9020\u5168\u7403\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u4e2d\u6587\u95e8\u6237\u7f51\u7ad9(muslimwww)|work=muslimwww.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}</ref> Ma Biao fought against the Japanese in the Boxer Rebellion.\n\n[[File:Wang Jingwei and officers of the Reorganized National Government of Chinese army.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wang Jingwei]] and officers of the [[Collaborationist Chinese Army]]]]\nAfter 1940, the Japanese encountered tremendous difficulties in administering and garrisoning the seized territories, and tried to solve its occupation problems by implementing a strategy of creating friendly [[Puppet state|puppet governments]] favourable to Japanese interests in the territories conquered, most prominently the [[Nanjing Nationalist Government]] headed by former KMT premier [[Wang Jingwei]]. However, [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, as well as Japanese refusal to delegate any real power, left the puppets very unpopular and largely ineffective. The only success the Japanese had was to recruit a large [[Collaborationist Chinese Army]] to maintain public security in the occupied areas.\n\n===Japanese expansion===\n[[File:1941 Type92 Combat Cars near Nanking.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Type 92 Heavy Armoured Car]]s near Nanjing, 1941]]\n\nBy 1941, Japan held most of the eastern coastal areas of China and Vietnam, but [[guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] fighting continued in these occupied areas.

In addition, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government was mired in a civil war against the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), as [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was quoted: \"the Japanese are a disease of the skin, the Communists are a disease of the heart\". The [[Second United Front]] between the KMT and CPC was never truly unified, as each side was preparing for a showdown with the other once the Japanese were driven out.\n\n[[File:Taierzhuang.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese soldiers in [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting in the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]], March\u2013April 1938]]\n\nEven under these extremely unfavorable circumstances, Chiang realized that to win support from the United States and other foreign nations, China had to prove it was capable of fighting. Knowing a hasty retreat would discourage foreign aid, Chiang resolved to make a stand [[Battle of Shanghai|at Shanghai]], using the best of his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|German-trained divisions]] to defend China's largest and most [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] city from the Japanese. The battle lasted over three months, saw heavy casualties on both sides, and ended with a Chinese retreat towards Nanjing, but proved that China would not be easily defeated and showed its determination to the world. The battle became an enormous morale booster for the Chinese people, as it decisively refuted the Japanese boast that Japan could conquer Shanghai in three days and China in three months.\n\nAfterwards, China began to adopt the [[Fabian strategy]] of \"trading space for time\" ({{zh|s=\u4ee5\u7a7a\u95f4\u6362\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4|t=\u4ee5\u7a7a\u9593\u63db\u53d6\u6642\u9593|links=no}}). The Chinese army would put up fights to delay the Japanese advance to northern and eastern cities, allowing the [[home front]], with its professionals and key industries, to retreat west into [[Chongqing]]. As a result of Chinese troops' [[scorched earth]] strategies, in which [[dam]]s and [[levee]]s were intentionally sabotaged to [[1938 Yellow River flood|create massive flooding]] which causes thousands of death and many more seeking refuge.\n\n====Second period (October 1938 \u2013 December 1941)====\n[[File:Chinese soldiers 1939.jpg|thumb|National Revolutionary Army soldiers march to the [[Military front|front]] in 1939.]]\n\nDuring this period, the main Chinese objective was to drag out the war for as long as possible in a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], thereby exhausting Japanese resources while building up Chinese military capacity. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] called this strategy \"winning by outlasting\". The NRA adopted the concept of \"magnetic warfare\" to attract advancing Japanese troops to definite points where they were subjected to ambush, [[Flanking maneuver|flanking attacks]], and [[encirclement]]s in major engagements. The most prominent example of this tactic was the successful defense of [[Changsha]] in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1939]] (and again in [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|1941]]), in which heavy casualties were inflicted on the IJA.\n\nLocal Chinese [[Resistance movement|resistance forces]], organized separately by both the communists and KMT, continued their resistance in occupied areas to pester the enemy and make their administration over the vast land area of China difficult. In 1940, the [[Eighth Route Army|Chinese Red Army]] launched a [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|major offensive]] in north China, destroying railways and a major coal mine. These constant harassment and sabotage operations deeply frustrated the Imperial Japanese Army and led them to employ the \"[[Three Alls Policy]]\" (kill all, loot all, burn all) ({{lang|hni|\u4e09\u5149\u653f\u7b56}}, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: ''S\u0101ngu\u0101ng Zh\u00e8ngc\u00e8'', Japanese [[Onyomi|On]]: ''Sank\u014d Seisaku''). It was during this period that the bulk of [[Japanese war crimes]] were committed.\n\nBy 1941, Japan had occupied much of north and coastal China, but the KMT central government and military had retreated to the western interior to continue their resistance, while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in [[Shaanxi]]. In the occupied areas, Japanese control was mainly limited to railroads and major cities (\"points and lines\"). They did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside, where Chinese guerrillas roamed freely.\n\n===Relationship between the Nationalists and Communists===\n[[File:Zhu De with NRA Emblem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eighth Route Army]] Commander [[Zhu De]] with KMT Blue Sky White Sun Emblem cap]]\n\nAfter the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931, Chinese public opinion was strongly critical of Manchuria's leader, the \"young marshal\" [[Zhang Xueliang]], for his nonresistance to the Japanese invasion, even though the Kuomintang central government was also responsible for this policy, giving Zhang an order to \"improvise\" while not offering support. After losing Manchuria to the Japanese, Zhang and his [[Fengtian clique|Northeast Army]] were given the duty of suppressing [[Chinese Red Army|the Red Army]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CPC) in [[Shaanxi]] after their [[Long March]]. This resulted in great casualties for his Northeast Army, which received no support in manpower or weaponry from Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nOn December 12, 1936, a deeply disgruntled Zhang Xueliang [[Xi'an Incident|kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek]] in [[Xi'an]], hoping to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CPC. To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT agreed to a temporary end to the [[Chinese Civil War]] and, on December 24, the creation of a [[Second United Front (China)|United Front]] between the CPC and KMT against Japan. The alliance having salutary effects for the beleaguered CPC, they agreed to form the [[New Fourth Army]] and the [[8th Route Army]] and place them under the nominal control of the NRA. The CPC's Red Army fought alongside KMT forces during the [[Battle of Taiyuan]], and the high point of their cooperation came in 1938 during the [[Battle of Wuhan]].\n\n[[File:Lin Biao in NRA uniform.jpg|thumb|left|upright|115th Division of the [[Eighth Route Army]] Commander-in-chief [[Lin Biao]] in NRA uniform]]\n\nDespite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions, and the rich [[Yangtze River]] Valley in central China, the distrust between the two antagonists was scarcely veiled. The uneasy alliance began to break down by late 1938, partially due to the Communists' aggressive efforts to expand their military strength by absorbing Chinese guerrilla forces behind Japanese lines. Chinese militia who refused to switch their allegiance were often labelled \"collaborators\" and attacked by CPC forces. For example, the Red Army led by [[He Long]] attacked and wiped out a brigade of Chinese militia led by Zhang Yin-wu in [[Hebei]] in June 1939.{{sfn|Huang|page=259}} Starting in 1940, open conflict between Nationalists and Communists became more frequent in the occupied areas outside of Japanese control, culminating in the [[New Fourth Army Incident]] in January 1941.\n\nAfterwards, the Second United Front completely broke down and Chinese Communists leader [[Mao Zedong]] outlined the preliminary plan for the CPC's eventual seizure of power from Chiang Kai-shek. Mao began his final push for consolidation of CPC power under his authority, and his teachings became the central tenets of the CPC doctrine that came to be formalized as \"[[Mao Zedong Thought]]\". The communists also began to focus most of their energy on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, [[Land ownership|land]] and [[Taxation|tax]] reform measures favoring poor [[peasant]]s; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas controlled by CPC and fighting the Japanese at the same time.<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{Cite news\n|title=Crisis\n|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801570-4,00.html\n|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\n|date=November 13, 1944}}</ref>\n\n===Entrance of the Western Allies===\n[[File:1941 Chinese War Declaration vs Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Declaration of war|War declaration]] against Japan by the Chongqing Nationalist Government in 9 December 1941]]\n[[File:Chiang Kai Shek and wife with Lieutenant General Stilwell.jpg|thumb|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his wife [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang]] with [[Lieutenant General]] [[Joseph Stilwell]] in 1942, [[British Burma|Burma]]]]\n[[File:Madamn Chiang Kaishek US Congress speech(1).ogg|thumb|On February 18, 1943, [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang Kai-shek]] addressed both houses of the US Congress.]]\n[[File:United China Relief1.jpg|thumb|A US poster advocating helping China fight on]]\n\nFollowing the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the United States declared war against Japan, and within days China joined the Allies in formal declaration of war against Japan, Germany and Italy.<ref name=\"China Declares War\">{{Cite journal|date=December 15, 1941 |title=China's Declaration of War Against Japan, Germany and Italy |journal=Contemporary China |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |volume=1 |issue=15 |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/chinawar.html |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref> As the Western Allies entered the war against Japan, the Sino-Japanese War would become part of a greater conflict, the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]] of [[World War II]].

For these reasons, the Chinese government never had the supplies and equipment needed to mount major counter-offensives. Despite the severe shortage of mat\u00e9riel, in 1943, the Chinese were successful in repelling major Japanese offensives [[Battle of West Hubei|in Hubei]] and [[Battle of Changde|Changde]].\n\nChiang was named Allied commander-in-chief in the China theater in 1942. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] served for a time as Chiang's chief of staff, while simultaneously commanding American forces in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater]]. For many reasons, relations between Stilwell and Chiang soon broke down. Many historians (such as [[Barbara W. Tuchman]]) have suggested it was largely due to the corruption and inefficiency of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government, while others (such as [[Ray Huang]] and [[Hans van de Ven]]) have depicted it as a more complicated situation. Stilwell had a strong desire to assume total control of Chinese troops and pursue an aggressive strategy, while Chiang preferred a patient and less expensive strategy of outwaiting the Japanese. Chiang continued to maintain a defensive posture despite Allied pleas to actively break the Japanese blockade, because China had already suffered tens of millions of war casualties and believed that Japan would eventually capitulate in the face of America's overwhelming industrial output. For these reasons the other Allies gradually began to lose confidence in the Chinese ability to conduct offensive operations from the Asian mainland, and instead concentrated their efforts against the Japanese in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] and [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]], employing an [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] strategy.<ref>Hans Van de Ven, \"Stilwell in the Stocks: The Chinese Nationalists and the Allied Powers in the Second World War\", ''Asian Affairs'' 34.3 (November 2003): 243\u2013259.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|left|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Winston Churchill]] met at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] in 1943 during World War II.]]\n\nLongstanding differences in national interest and political stance among China, the United States, and the United Kingdom remained in place. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was reluctant to devote British troops, many of whom had been routed by the Japanese in earlier campaigns, to the reopening of the [[Burma Road]]; Stilwell, on the other hand, believed that reopening the road was vital, as all China's mainland ports were under Japanese control. The Allies' \"[[Europe first|Europe First]]\" policy did not sit well with Chiang, while the later British insistence that China send more and more troops to Indochina for use in the [[Burma Campaign]] was seen by Chiang as an attempt to use Chinese manpower to defend British colonial holdings. Chiang also believed that China should divert its crack army divisions from Burma to eastern China to defend the airbases of the American bombers that he hoped would defeat Japan through bombing, a strategy that American general [[Claire Lee Chennault]] supported but which Stilwell strongly opposed. In addition, Chiang voiced his support of [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] in a 1942 meeting with [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]], which further soured the relationship between China and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Huang|pages=299\u2013300}}\n\nAmerican and Canadian-born Chinese were recruited to act as covert operatives in Japanese-occupied China (Canadian-born Chinese who had not been granted citizenship were trained by the British army).

In 1944, with the Japanese position in the Pacific deteriorating rapidly, the IJA mobilized over 500,000 men and launched Operation Ichi-Go, their largest offensive of World War II, to attack the American airbases in China and link up the railway between Manchuria and Vietnam. This brought major cities in Hunan, Henan and Guangxi under Japanese occupation. The failure of Chinese forces to defend these areas encouraged Stilwell to attempt to gain overall command of the Chinese army, and his subsequent showdown with Chiang led to his replacement by Major General [[Albert Coady Wedemeyer]].\n\nBy the end of 1944 [[Chinese Army in India|Chinese troops]] under the command of [[Sun Li-jen]] attacking from India, and those under [[Wei Lihuang]] attacking from [[Yunnan]], joined forces in [[Mong-Yu]], successfully driving the Japanese out of North Burma and securing the [[Ledo Road]], China's vital supply artery.{{sfn|Huang|page=420}} In Spring 1945 the Chinese launched offensives that retook [[Battle of West Hunan|Hunan]] and [[Second Guangxi Campaign|Guangxi]].

As the Japanese occupation of northern French Indochina in 1940 had already cut off supplies from the West to China, the move into southern French Indochina was viewed as a direct threat to British and Dutch colonies. Many principal figures in the Japanese government and military (particularly the navy) were against the move, as they foresaw that it would invite retaliation from the West.\n\n[[File:FreeThaiinChina.jpg|thumb|left|[[Free Thai Movement|Free Thai]], American and Chinese military officers in China during the war]]\n\n{{anchor|Oil embargo (Sino-Japanese War)}}\nOn July 24, 1941, Roosevelt requested Japan withdraw all its forces from Indochina.

The economy was sapped by the military demands of a long costly war and internal strife, by spiraling inflation, and by corruption in the Nationalist government that included profiteering, speculation and hoarding.\n\nFurthermore, as part of the Yalta Conference, which allowed a Soviet sphere of influence in Manchuria, the Soviets dismantled and removed more than half of the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese before handing over Manchuria to China. Large swathes of the prime farming areas had been ravaged by the fighting and there was starvation in the wake of the war. Many towns and cities were destroyed, and millions were rendered homeless by floods.\n\nThe problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction after the ravages of a protracted war were staggering, and the war left the Nationalists severely weakened, and their policies left them unpopular. Meanwhile, the war strengthened the Communists both in popularity and as a viable fighting force. At Yan'an and elsewhere in the communist controlled areas, Mao Zedong was able to adapt [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] to Chinese conditions. He taught party cadres to lead the masses by living and working with them, eating their food, and thinking their thoughts.\n\nThe [[Chinese Red Army]] fostered an image of conducting guerrilla warfare in defense of the people. Communist troops adapted to changing wartime conditions and became a seasoned fighting force. With skillful organization and propaganda, the Communists increased party membership from 100,000 in 1937 to 1.2 million by 1945.\n\nMao also began to execute his plan to establish a new China by rapidly moving his forces from Yan'an and elsewhere to Manchuria. This opportunity was available to the Communists because although Nationalist representatives were not invited to Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in the belief that the Soviet Union would cooperate only with the Nationalist government after the war.\n\nHowever, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria was long enough to allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Imperial Japanese Army, quickly establish control in the countryside and move into position to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China. Following that, the Chinese Civil War broke out between the Nationalists and Communists, which concluded with the Communist victory in [[mainland China]] and the retreat of the Nationalists to [[Taiwan]] in 1949.\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:AntijapaneseWarMemorialMuseum.jpg|thumb|China War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial Museum on the site where the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] took place]]\n\nThe question as to which political group directed the Chinese war effort and exerted most of the effort to resist the Japanese remains a controversial issue.\n\nIn the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial near the [[Lugou Bridge|Marco Polo Bridge]] and in mainland Chinese textbooks, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims that the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] mostly avoided fighting the Japanese to preserve their strength for a final showdown with the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC or CCP), while the Communists were the main military force in the Chinese resistance efforts.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Recently, however, with a change in the political climate, the CPC has admitted that certain Nationalist generals made important contributions in resisting the Japanese. The official history in mainland China now states that the KMT fought a bloody, yet indecisive, frontal war against Japan, while the CPC engaged the Japanese forces in far greater numbers behind enemy lines. For the sake of [[Chinese reunification]] and appeasing the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on [[Taiwan]], the PRC has begun to acknowledge the Nationalists and the Communists as equal contributors, because the victory over Japan belonged to the [[Chinese people]], rather than to any political party.<ref name=\"China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender\u2014New York Times\">{{Cite news\n|title=China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender\n|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7D81431F937A3575AC0A9639C8B63&scp=1&sq=Hu%20jintao%20Victory%20Japan&st=cse\n|work=New York Times\n|date=September 4, 2005\n| first=Joseph\n| last=Kahn\n| accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Nationalists suffered higher casualties because they were the main combatants opposing the Japanese in each of the 22 major battles (involving more than 100,000 troops on both sides) between China and Japan. The Communist forces, by contrast, usually avoided pitched battles with the Japanese and generally limited their combat to guerilla actions (the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] are notable exceptions). The Nationalists committed their strongest divisions in early battle against the Japanese (including the 36th, 87th, 88th divisions, the crack divisions of Chiang's Central Army) to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]] and continued to deploy most of their forces to fight the Japanese even as the Communists changed their strategy to engage mainly in a political offensive against the Japanese while declaring that the CPC should \"save and preserve our strength and wait for favorable timing\" by the end of 1941.<ref>Yang Kuisong, \"The Formation and Implementation of the Chinese Communists' Guerrilla Warfare Strategy in the Enemy's Rear during the Sino-Japanese War\", paper presented at Harvard University Conference on Wartime China, Maui, January 2004, pp. 32\u201336</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===China-Japan relations===\nToday, the war is a major point of contention and resentment between China and Japan.

Japan's position has been to avoid commenting on Taiwan's status, maintaining that Japan renounced all claims to sovereignty over its former colonial possessions after World War II, including Taiwan.<ref>[http://home.kyodo.co.jp/modules/fstStory/index.php?storyid=453676]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} FOCUS: Taiwan\u2013Japan ties back on shaky ground as Taipei snubs Tokyo envoy</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the [[Republic of China]] government has held celebrations marking the [[Victory Day]] on September 9 (now known as [[Armed Forces Day]]) and Taiwan's [[Retrocession Day]] on October 25. However, after the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[2000 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election]] in 2000, these national holidays commemorating the war have been cancelled as the [[Taiwan Independence|pro-independent]] DPP does not see the relevancy of celebrating events that happened in mainland China.\n\nMeanwhile, many KMT supporters, particularly veterans who retreated with the government in 1949, still have an emotional interest in the war. For example, in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of war in 2005, the cultural bureau of KMT stronghold [[Taipei]] held a series of talks in the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] regarding the war and post-war developments, while the KMT held its own exhibit in the KMT headquarters. Whereas the KMT won the [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election]] in 2008, the ROC government resumed commemorating the war.\n\n===Japanese women left behind in China===\n{{Main|Japanese people in China}}\n\nSeveral thousand Japanese who were sent as colonizers to [[Manchukuo]] and Inner Mongolia were left behind in China.

From 1937 to 1941, 185,647 Japanese soldiers were killed in China and 520,000 were wounded. Disease also incurred critical losses on Japanese forces. From 1937 to 1941, 430,000 Japanese soldiers were recorded as being sick.

It began with the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in 1937 in which a dispute between Japanese and Chinese troops escalated into a battle.

The period after [[World War I]] brought about increasing stress on the Japanese polity. Leftists sought universal suffrage and greater rights for workers. Increasing textile production from Chinese mills was adversely affecting Japanese production. The [[Great Depression]] brought about a large slowdown in exports. All of this contributed to militant [[nationalism]], culminating in the rise to power of a militarist faction. This faction was led at its height by the [[Hideki Tojo]] cabinet of the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] under edict from Emperor [[Hirohito]]. In 1931, the [[Mukden Incident]] helped spark the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]]. The Chinese were defeated and Japan created a new puppet state, [[Manchukuo]]; many historians cite 1931 as the beginning of the war.<ref name=\"Hotta2007\">{{cite book|last=Hotta|first=E.|title=Pan-Asianism and Japan's War 1931-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kih_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA75|date=25 December 2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-0-230-60992-1|page=40}}</ref><ref name=\"Paine2012\">{{cite book|last=Paine|first=S.

From 1931 to 1937, China and Japan continued to skirmish in small, localized engagements, so-called \"incidents\".\n\nFollowing the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Japanese scored major victories, capturing [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Beijing]], [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]] and the Chinese capital of [[Battle of Nanjing|Nanjing]] in 1937, which resulted in the [[Massacre of Nanjing|Rape of Nanjing]]. After failing to stop the Japanese in the [[Battle of Wuhan]], the Chinese central government was relocated to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking) in the Chinese interior. By 1939, after Chinese victories in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|Changsha]] and [[Battle of South Guangxi|Guangxi]], and with Japan's lines of communications stretched deep into the Chinese interior, the war reached a stalemate. The Japanese were also unable to defeat the Chinese communist forces in [[Shaanxi]], who waged a campaign of sabotage and guerrilla warfare against the invaders. While Japan ruled the large cities, they lacked sufficient manpower to control China's vast countryside. In November 1939, Chinese nationalist forces [[1939\u201340 Winter Offensive|launched a large scale winter offensive]], while in August 1940, Chinese communist forces [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|launched a counteroffensive]] in central China.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. The following day the [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|United States declared war on Japan]]. The United States began to aid China by airlifting material over [[the Hump|the Himalayas]] after the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] defeat in [[Japanese conquest of Burma|Burma]] that closed the [[Burma Road]]. In 1944, Japan launched the invasion, [[Operation Ichi-Go]], that conquered [[Henan]] and [[Changsha]]. However, this failed to bring about the surrender of Chinese forces. In 1945, the [[Chinese Expeditionary Force]] resumed [[Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan|its advance in Burma]] and completed the [[Ledo Road]] linking India to China. At the same time, China launched large counteroffensives in South China and [[Battle of West Hunan|retook West Hunan]] [[Second Guangxi Campaign|and Guangxi]].\n\nOn August 15, 1945, following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviet Union invasion of Japanese-held Manchuria]], Japan capitulated to Allied forces.  Japan continued to occupy part of China's territory until it formally [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered on September 2, 1945]].

The conflicts were collectively known as the [[Jinan incident]] of 1928, during which time the Japanese military violently killed several Chinese officials and fired artillery shells into Jinan. Between 2,000 and 11,000 Chinese and Japanese civilians were believed to have been killed during these conflicts.

Manchuria was central to Japan's East Asia policy. Both the 1921 and 1927 Imperial Eastern Region Conferences reconfirmed Japan's commitment to be the dominant power in the Northeast. The 1929 Red Army victory shook that policy to the core and reopened the Manchurian problem. By 1930, the Kwantung Army realized they faced a Red Army that was only growing stronger. The time to act was drawing near and Japanese plans to conquer the Northeast were accelerated.<ref>Michael M.

The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) previously fought openly against the Nanjing government after the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]], and they continued to expand during this civil war. The Kuomintang government in Nanjing decided to focus their efforts on suppressing the Chinese Communists through the [[Encirclement Campaigns]], following the policy of \"first internal pacification, then external resistance\" ({{zh|c=\u6518\u5916\u5fc5\u5148\u5b89\u5167|links=no}}).\n\n==Prelude: invasion of Manchuria and Northern China==\n{{anchor|occupation}}\n[[File:Mukden 1931 japan shenyang.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese troops entering [[Shenyang]] during the [[Mukden Incident]]]]\n\nThe internecine warfare in China provided excellent opportunities for Japan, which saw Manchuria as a limitless supply of raw materials, a market for its manufactured goods (now excluded from the markets of many Western countries as a result of [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[tariff]]s), and a protective [[buffer state]] against the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Siberia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japan invaded Manchuria]] outright after the [[Mukden Incident]] in September 1931. Japan charged that its rights in Manchuria, which had been established as a result of its victory at the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], had been systematically violated and there were \"more than 120 cases of infringement of rights and interests, interference with business, boycott of Japanese goods, unreasonable taxation, detention of individuals, confiscation of properties, eviction, demand for cessation of business, assault and battery, and the oppression of Korean residents\".<ref>[http://ibiblio.org/pha/monos/144/144chap1.html POLITICAL STRATEGY PRIOR TO OUTBREAK OF WAR PART I] Japanese monograph No. 144</ref>\n\nAfter five months of fighting, Japan established the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932, and installed the last [[Emperor of China]], [[Puyi]], as its puppet ruler. Militarily too weak to challenge Japan directly, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. The League's investigation led to the publication of the [[Lytton Report]], condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, causing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. No country took action against Japan beyond tepid censure.\n\nIncessant fighting followed the Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought the [[January 28 Incident]] battle. This resulted in the [[demilitarisation]] of [[Shanghai]], which forbade the Chinese from deploying troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an [[Pacification of Manchukuo|ongoing campaign]] to defeat the [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies]] that arose from widespread outrage over the policy of non-resistance to Japan.\n[[File:Dadao map 1939.svg|thumb|260px|Japanese Empire's [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|territorial expansion]]]]\nIn 1933, the Japanese [[Defense of the Great Wall|attacked the Great Wall]] region. The [[Tanggu Truce]] established in its aftermath, gave Japan control of [[Rehe Province|Jehol]] province as well as a demilitarized zone between the Great Wall and Beiping-Tianjin region. Japan aimed to create another buffer zone between Manchukuo and the Chinese Nationalist government in [[Nanjing]].\n\nJapan increasingly exploited China's internal conflicts to reduce the strength of its fractious opponents. Even years after the [[Northern Expedition]], the political power of the Nationalist government was limited to just the area of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Other sections of China were essentially in the hands of local Chinese warlords. Japan sought various [[Hanjian|Chinese collaborators]] and helped them establish governments friendly to Japan. This policy was called the ''Specialization'' of [[North China]] ({{zh|c=\u83ef\u5317\u7279\u6b8a\u5316|p=hu\u00e1b\u011bit\u00e8sh\u016bh\u00f9a|links=no}}), more commonly known as the North China Autonomous Movement. The northern provinces affected by this policy were [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], [[Suiyuan]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], and [[Shandong]].\n\nThis Japanese policy was most effective in the area of what is now [[Inner Mongolia]] and Hebei. In 1935, under Japanese pressure, China signed the [[He\u2013Umezu Agreement]], which forbade the KMT from conducting party operations in Hebei. In the same year, the [[Chin\u2013Doihara Agreement]] was signed expelling the KMT from Chahar. Thus, by the end of 1935 the Chinese government had essentially abandoned northern China. In its place, the Japanese-backed [[East Hebei Autonomous Council]] and the [[Hebei\u2013Chahar Political Council]] were established. There in the empty space of Chahar the [[Mengjiang|Mongol Military Government]] was formed on May 12, 1936. Japan provided all the necessary military and economic aid. Afterwards Chinese volunteer forces continued to resist Japanese aggression [[Pacification of Manchukuo|in Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933\u20131936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].\n\n==Course of the war==\n\n===1937: Full-scale invasion of China===\n[[File:Jiangjieshi-declare.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] announced the [[Kuomintang]] policy of resistance against Japan at [[Lushan District|Lushan]] on July 10, 1937, three days after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]].]]\n\nOn the night of July 7, 1937, Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo (or Lugou) Bridge, a crucial access-route to Beijing. What began as confused, sporadic skirmishing soon escalated into a full-scale battle in which [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Beijing]] and its port city of Tianjin fell to Japanese forces (July\u2013August 1937). On July 29, some 5,000 troops of the 1st and 2nd Corps of the East Hopei Army mutinied, turning against the Japanese garrison. In addition to Japanese military personnel, some 260 civilians living in Tongzhou in accordance with the [[Boxer Protocol]] of 1901, were killed in the uprising (predominantly Japanese including the police force and also some ethnic Koreans). The Chinese then set fire to and destroyed much of the city. Only around 60 Japanese civilians survived, who provided both journalists and later historians with firsthand witness accounts. As a result of the violence of the mutiny against Japanese civilians, the [[Tungchow mutiny]], as it came to be called, strongly shook public opinion within Japan.\n\n===Battle of Shanghai===\n{{Main|Battle of Shanghai}}\n\n[[File:Shanghai1937IJA landing.jpg|thumb|Japanese landing near Shanghai, November 1937]]\n\nThe [[Imperial General Headquarters]] (GHQ) in Tokyo, content with the gains acquired in northern China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, initially showed reluctance to escalate the conflict into full-scale war. The KMT, however, determined that the \"breaking point\" of Japanese aggression had been reached. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] quickly mobilized the central government's army and [[Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937\u20131945)|air force]], placed them under his direct command, and laid siege to the Japanese area of [[Shanghai International Settlement]], where 30,000 Japanese civilians lived with 30,000 troops on August 12, 1937.\n\n[[File:Shanghai1937KMT machine gun nest.jpg|thumb|left|An NRA soldiers' machine gun nest in Shanghai]]\n\nOn August 13, 1937, [[Kuomintang]] soldiers and warplanes attacked [[Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces|Japanese Marine]] positions in Shanghai, leading to the [[Battle of Shanghai]].

They thought this would preserve strength for an anticipated showdown with the Soviet Union, but by now the Japanese government and GHQ had effectively lost control of the Japanese army in China. With many victories achieved, Japanese field generals [[Battle of Xuzhou|escalated the war in Jiangsu]] in an attempt to wipe out Chinese resistance, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]] (March\u2013April 1938). Afterwards the IJA changed its strategy and deployed almost all of its existing armies in China to attack the city of [[Wuhan]], which had become the political, economic and military center of rump China, in hopes of destroying the fighting strength of the [[National Revolutionary Army|NRA]] and of forcing the KMT government to negotiate for peace.{{sfn|Huang|page=168}} The Japanese [[Battle of Wuhan|captured Wuhan]] on October 27, 1938, forcing the KMT to retreat to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking), but Chiang Kai-shek still refused to negotiate, saying he would only consider talks if Japan agreed to withdraw to the pre-1937 borders. In 1937, the Japanese Imperial Army quickly marched into the heart of Chinese territory. On June 6, they captured Kaifeng, the capital of Henan, and threatened to take Zhengzhou, the junction of the Pinghan and Longhai railways. To prevent Japanese advances in western and southern China, Chiang Kai-shek, at the suggestion of Chen Guofu, ordered the opening of the dikes on the Yellow River near Zhengzhou. The original plan was to destroy the dike in Zhaokou, but due to difficulties in that place, the Huayuankou dike on the south bank was destroyed on June 5 and June 7 by excavation, with flood waters over Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The floods covered and destroyed thousands of square kilometers of agricultural land and displaced the mouth of the Yellow River hundreds of miles to the south. Thousands of villages were flooded or destroyed and several million villagers were expelled from their homes. About 800,000 drowned and an additional 10 million became refugees. Damage to plantations also affected the population which generated later hunger.\n\nWith Japanese casualties and costs mounting, the Imperial General Headquarters attempted to break Chinese resistance by ordering the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|air branches of their navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|army]] to launch the war's first [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Japanese bombing|massive air raids]] on civilian targets. Japanese raiders hit the Kuomintang's newly established [[Bombing of Chongqing|provisional capital of Chongqing]] and most other major cities in unoccupied China, leaving millions dead, injured, and homeless.\n\n===1939\u201340: Chinese counterattack and stalemate===\n[[File:Second Sino-Japanese War WW2.png|thumb|Map showing the extent of Japanese occupation in 1941 (in red)]]\n[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped)]]\n\nFrom the beginning of 1939, the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at [[Battle of Suixian\u2013Zaoyang]], [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1st Battle of Changsha]], [[Battle of South Guangxi]] and [[Battle of Zaoyi]]. These outcomes encouraged the Chinese to launch their first large-scale [[1939\u20131940 Winter Offensive|counter-offensive]] against the IJA in early 1940; however, due to its low military-industrial capacity and limited experience in [[modern warfare]], this offensive was defeated. Afterwards Chiang could not risk any more all-out offensive campaigns given the poorly trained, under-equipped, and disorganized state of his armies and opposition to his leadership both within the Kuomintang and in China in general. He had lost a substantial portion of his best trained and equipped troops in the [[Battle of Shanghai]] and was at times at the mercy of his generals, who maintained a high degree of autonomy from the central KMT government.\n\nDuring the offensive, Hui forces in Suiyuan under generals [[Ma Hongbin]] and [[Ma Buqing]] routed the Imperial Japanese Army and their puppet Inner Mongol forces and prevented the planned Japanese advance into northwest China. Ma Hongbin's father [[Ma Fulu]] had fought against Japanese in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. General [[Ma Biao (general)|Ma Biao]] led Hui, Salar and Dongxiang cavalry to defeat the Japanese at the [[Battle of Huaiyang]].<ref>[http://www.zk.ccoo.cn/news/local/3889814.html 8000\u9a91\u5175\u6218\u58eb\u6218\u6b7b\u6297\u65e5\u6c99\u573a\uff0c\u53ef\u6b4c\u53ef\u6ce3_\u5468\u53e3\u70ed\u70b9\u8d44\u8baf<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022054615/http://www.zk.ccoo.cn/news/local/3889814.html |date=October 22, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://qhmhmlc.blog.163.com/blog/static/294989642015824284687?suggestedreading|title=\u9752\u6d77\u516b\u5343\u4eba\u9a91\u5175\u5e08\u4e1c\u8fdb\u6297\u65e5 \u2013 \u6606\u4ed1\u7389\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7 \u2013 \u7f51\u6613\u535a\u5ba2|last=qhmhmlc,\u6606\u4ed1\u7389|work=163.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112172144/http://qhmhmlc.blog.163.com/blog/static/294989642015824284687?suggestedreading|archive-date=January 12, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://qh.people.com.cn/n/2015/0831/c181467-26189312.html|title=\u5188\u6751\u5b81\u6b21\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5728\u4f5c\u6218\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u5199\u4e0b\"\u6076\u6218\u9a6c\u5f6a\"--\u9752\u6d77\u9891\u9053--\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51|last=L_104241|work=people.com.cn|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yododo.com/area/photo/013EE3A4D9ED097BFF8080813EE2DC53|title=\u9a6c\u5f6a\uff081885\u2014\u2014... - \u5357\u660c\u7167\u7247 by \u5c71\u4e2d\u8001\u4eba\u5bb6|author=|date=|website=www.yododo.com|access-date=October 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112160043/http://www.yododo.com/area/photo/013EE3A4D9ED097BFF8080813EE2DC53|archive-date=January 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://m.qulishi.com/news/201411/20135.html \u9a6c\u6b65\u82b3\u519b\u961f\u6297\u6218\u7eaa\u5b9e\uff1a\u6297\u6218\u4e2d\u7684\u9a6c\u6b65\u82b3\u548c\u9a6c\u5bb6\u519b\uff01 -\u8da3\u5386\u53f2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimwww.com/html/2014/lishi_0421/23732.html|title=\u4e3a\u6297\u51fb\u65e5\u5bc7\u548c\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u4e2d\u56fd\u6d74\u8840\u594b\u6597\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u7a46\u65af\u6797 \u2013 \u5386\u53f2 \u2013 \u7a46\u65af\u6797\u5728\u7ebf-\u6253\u9020\u5168\u7403\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u4e2d\u6587\u95e8\u6237\u7f51\u7ad9(muslimwww)|work=muslimwww.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qulishi.com/news/201411/20135.html|title=\u9a6c\u6b65\u82b3\u519b\u961f\u6297\u6218\u7eaa\u5b9e\uff1a\u6297\u6218\u4e2d\u7684\u9a6c\u6b65\u82b3\u548c\u9a6c\u5bb6\u519b\uff01- \u8da3\u5386\u53f2|work=qulishi.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912090554/http://www.qulishi.com/news/201411/20135.html|archive-date=September 12, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.chinaislam.net.cn/cms/whyj/mmxm/zmrs/201412/14-7574.html \u8ba9\u65e5\u519b\u95fb\u98ce\u4e27\u80c6\u5730\u56de\u65cf\u6297\u65e5\u540d\u5c06<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702131936/http://www.chinaislam.net.cn/cms/whyj/mmxm/zmrs/201412/14-7574.html |date=July 2, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimwww.com/html/2013/lishi_0411/13152.html|title=\u8fd8\u539f\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u897f\u5317\u7fa4\u9a6c\u4e4b\u9a6c\u6b65\u82b3 \u9a91\u516b\u5e08\u4e2d\u539f\u6297\u65e5 \u2013 \u5386\u53f2 \u2013 \u7a46\u65af\u6797\u5728\u7ebf-\u6253\u9020\u5168\u7403\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u4e2d\u6587\u95e8\u6237\u7f51\u7ad9(muslimwww)|work=muslimwww.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}</ref> Ma Biao fought against the Japanese in the Boxer Rebellion.\n\n[[File:Wang Jingwei and officers of the Reorganized National Government of Chinese army.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wang Jingwei]] and officers of the [[Collaborationist Chinese Army]]]]\nAfter 1940, the Japanese encountered tremendous difficulties in administering and garrisoning the seized territories, and tried to solve its occupation problems by implementing a strategy of creating friendly [[Puppet state|puppet governments]] favourable to Japanese interests in the territories conquered, most prominently the [[Nanjing Nationalist Government]] headed by former KMT premier [[Wang Jingwei]]. However, [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, as well as Japanese refusal to delegate any real power, left the puppets very unpopular and largely ineffective. The only success the Japanese had was to recruit a large [[Collaborationist Chinese Army]] to maintain public security in the occupied areas.\n\n===Japanese expansion===\n[[File:1941 Type92 Combat Cars near Nanking.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Type 92 Heavy Armoured Car]]s near Nanjing, 1941]]\n\nBy 1941, Japan held most of the eastern coastal areas of China and Vietnam, but [[guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] fighting continued in these occupied areas.

In addition, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government was mired in a civil war against the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), as [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was quoted: \"the Japanese are a disease of the skin, the Communists are a disease of the heart\". The [[Second United Front]] between the KMT and CPC was never truly unified, as each side was preparing for a showdown with the other once the Japanese were driven out.\n\n[[File:Taierzhuang.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese soldiers in [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting in the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]], March\u2013April 1938]]\n\nEven under these extremely unfavorable circumstances, Chiang realized that to win support from the United States and other foreign nations, China had to prove it was capable of fighting. Knowing a hasty retreat would discourage foreign aid, Chiang resolved to make a stand [[Battle of Shanghai|at Shanghai]], using the best of his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|German-trained divisions]] to defend China's largest and most [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] city from the Japanese. The battle lasted over three months, saw heavy casualties on both sides, and ended with a Chinese retreat towards Nanjing, but proved that China would not be easily defeated and showed its determination to the world. The battle became an enormous morale booster for the Chinese people, as it decisively refuted the Japanese boast that Japan could conquer Shanghai in three days and China in three months.\n\nAfterwards, China began to adopt the [[Fabian strategy]] of \"trading space for time\" ({{zh|s=\u4ee5\u7a7a\u95f4\u6362\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4|t=\u4ee5\u7a7a\u9593\u63db\u53d6\u6642\u9593|links=no}}). The Chinese army would put up fights to delay the Japanese advance to northern and eastern cities, allowing the [[home front]], with its professionals and key industries, to retreat west into [[Chongqing]]. As a result of Chinese troops' [[scorched earth]] strategies, in which [[dam]]s and [[levee]]s were intentionally sabotaged to [[1938 Yellow River flood|create massive flooding]] which causes thousands of death and many more seeking refuge.\n\n====Second period (October 1938 \u2013 December 1941)====\n[[File:Chinese soldiers 1939.jpg|thumb|National Revolutionary Army soldiers march to the [[Military front|front]] in 1939.]]\n\nDuring this period, the main Chinese objective was to drag out the war for as long as possible in a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], thereby exhausting Japanese resources while building up Chinese military capacity. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] called this strategy \"winning by outlasting\". The NRA adopted the concept of \"magnetic warfare\" to attract advancing Japanese troops to definite points where they were subjected to ambush, [[Flanking maneuver|flanking attacks]], and [[encirclement]]s in major engagements. The most prominent example of this tactic was the successful defense of [[Changsha]] in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1939]] (and again in [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|1941]]), in which heavy casualties were inflicted on the IJA.\n\nLocal Chinese [[Resistance movement|resistance forces]], organized separately by both the communists and KMT, continued their resistance in occupied areas to pester the enemy and make their administration over the vast land area of China difficult. In 1940, the [[Eighth Route Army|Chinese Red Army]] launched a [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|major offensive]] in north China, destroying railways and a major coal mine. These constant harassment and sabotage operations deeply frustrated the Imperial Japanese Army and led them to employ the \"[[Three Alls Policy]]\" (kill all, loot all, burn all) ({{lang|hni|\u4e09\u5149\u653f\u7b56}}, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: ''S\u0101ngu\u0101ng Zh\u00e8ngc\u00e8'', Japanese [[Onyomi|On]]: ''Sank\u014d Seisaku''). It was during this period that the bulk of [[Japanese war crimes]] were committed.\n\nBy 1941, Japan had occupied much of north and coastal China, but the KMT central government and military had retreated to the western interior to continue their resistance, while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in [[Shaanxi]]. In the occupied areas, Japanese control was mainly limited to railroads and major cities (\"points and lines\"). They did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside, where Chinese guerrillas roamed freely.\n\n===Relationship between the Nationalists and Communists===\n[[File:Zhu De with NRA Emblem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eighth Route Army]] Commander [[Zhu De]] with KMT Blue Sky White Sun Emblem cap]]\n\nAfter the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931, Chinese public opinion was strongly critical of Manchuria's leader, the \"young marshal\" [[Zhang Xueliang]], for his nonresistance to the Japanese invasion, even though the Kuomintang central government was also responsible for this policy, giving Zhang an order to \"improvise\" while not offering support. After losing Manchuria to the Japanese, Zhang and his [[Fengtian clique|Northeast Army]] were given the duty of suppressing [[Chinese Red Army|the Red Army]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CPC) in [[Shaanxi]] after their [[Long March]]. This resulted in great casualties for his Northeast Army, which received no support in manpower or weaponry from Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nOn December 12, 1936, a deeply disgruntled Zhang Xueliang [[Xi'an Incident|kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek]] in [[Xi'an]], hoping to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CPC. To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT agreed to a temporary end to the [[Chinese Civil War]] and, on December 24, the creation of a [[Second United Front (China)|United Front]] between the CPC and KMT against Japan. The alliance having salutary effects for the beleaguered CPC, they agreed to form the [[New Fourth Army]] and the [[8th Route Army]] and place them under the nominal control of the NRA. The CPC's Red Army fought alongside KMT forces during the [[Battle of Taiyuan]], and the high point of their cooperation came in 1938 during the [[Battle of Wuhan]].\n\n[[File:Lin Biao in NRA uniform.jpg|thumb|left|upright|115th Division of the [[Eighth Route Army]] Commander-in-chief [[Lin Biao]] in NRA uniform]]\n\nDespite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions, and the rich [[Yangtze River]] Valley in central China, the distrust between the two antagonists was scarcely veiled. The uneasy alliance began to break down by late 1938, partially due to the Communists' aggressive efforts to expand their military strength by absorbing Chinese guerrilla forces behind Japanese lines. Chinese militia who refused to switch their allegiance were often labelled \"collaborators\" and attacked by CPC forces. For example, the Red Army led by [[He Long]] attacked and wiped out a brigade of Chinese militia led by Zhang Yin-wu in [[Hebei]] in June 1939.{{sfn|Huang|page=259}} Starting in 1940, open conflict between Nationalists and Communists became more frequent in the occupied areas outside of Japanese control, culminating in the [[New Fourth Army Incident]] in January 1941.\n\nAfterwards, the Second United Front completely broke down and Chinese Communists leader [[Mao Zedong]] outlined the preliminary plan for the CPC's eventual seizure of power from Chiang Kai-shek. Mao began his final push for consolidation of CPC power under his authority, and his teachings became the central tenets of the CPC doctrine that came to be formalized as \"[[Mao Zedong Thought]]\". The communists also began to focus most of their energy on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, [[Land ownership|land]] and [[Taxation|tax]] reform measures favoring poor [[peasant]]s; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas controlled by CPC and fighting the Japanese at the same time.<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{Cite news\n|title=Crisis\n|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801570-4,00.html\n|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\n|date=November 13, 1944}}</ref>\n\n===Entrance of the Western Allies===\n[[File:1941 Chinese War Declaration vs Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Declaration of war|War declaration]] against Japan by the Chongqing Nationalist Government in 9 December 1941]]\n[[File:Chiang Kai Shek and wife with Lieutenant General Stilwell.jpg|thumb|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his wife [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang]] with [[Lieutenant General]] [[Joseph Stilwell]] in 1942, [[British Burma|Burma]]]]\n[[File:Madamn Chiang Kaishek US Congress speech(1).ogg|thumb|On February 18, 1943, [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang Kai-shek]] addressed both houses of the US Congress.]]\n[[File:United China Relief1.jpg|thumb|A US poster advocating helping China fight on]]\n\nFollowing the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the United States declared war against Japan, and within days China joined the Allies in formal declaration of war against Japan, Germany and Italy.<ref name=\"China Declares War\">{{Cite journal|date=December 15, 1941 |title=China's Declaration of War Against Japan, Germany and Italy |journal=Contemporary China |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |volume=1 |issue=15 |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/chinawar.html |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref> As the Western Allies entered the war against Japan, the Sino-Japanese War would become part of a greater conflict, the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]] of [[World War II]].

For these reasons, the Chinese government never had the supplies and equipment needed to mount major counter-offensives. Despite the severe shortage of mat\u00e9riel, in 1943, the Chinese were successful in repelling major Japanese offensives [[Battle of West Hubei|in Hubei]] and [[Battle of Changde|Changde]].\n\nChiang was named Allied commander-in-chief in the China theater in 1942. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] served for a time as Chiang's chief of staff, while simultaneously commanding American forces in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater]]. For many reasons, relations between Stilwell and Chiang soon broke down. Many historians (such as [[Barbara W. Tuchman]]) have suggested it was largely due to the corruption and inefficiency of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government, while others (such as [[Ray Huang]] and [[Hans van de Ven]]) have depicted it as a more complicated situation. Stilwell had a strong desire to assume total control of Chinese troops and pursue an aggressive strategy, while Chiang preferred a patient and less expensive strategy of outwaiting the Japanese. Chiang continued to maintain a defensive posture despite Allied pleas to actively break the Japanese blockade, because China had already suffered tens of millions of war casualties and believed that Japan would eventually capitulate in the face of America's overwhelming industrial output. For these reasons the other Allies gradually began to lose confidence in the Chinese ability to conduct offensive operations from the Asian mainland, and instead concentrated their efforts against the Japanese in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] and [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]], employing an [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] strategy.<ref>Hans Van de Ven, \"Stilwell in the Stocks: The Chinese Nationalists and the Allied Powers in the Second World War\", ''Asian Affairs'' 34.3 (November 2003): 243\u2013259.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|left|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Winston Churchill]] met at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] in 1943 during World War II.]]\n\nLongstanding differences in national interest and political stance among China, the United States, and the United Kingdom remained in place. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was reluctant to devote British troops, many of whom had been routed by the Japanese in earlier campaigns, to the reopening of the [[Burma Road]]; Stilwell, on the other hand, believed that reopening the road was vital, as all China's mainland ports were under Japanese control. The Allies' \"[[Europe first|Europe First]]\" policy did not sit well with Chiang, while the later British insistence that China send more and more troops to Indochina for use in the [[Burma Campaign]] was seen by Chiang as an attempt to use Chinese manpower to defend British colonial holdings. Chiang also believed that China should divert its crack army divisions from Burma to eastern China to defend the airbases of the American bombers that he hoped would defeat Japan through bombing, a strategy that American general [[Claire Lee Chennault]] supported but which Stilwell strongly opposed. In addition, Chiang voiced his support of [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] in a 1942 meeting with [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]], which further soured the relationship between China and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Huang|pages=299\u2013300}}\n\nAmerican and Canadian-born Chinese were recruited to act as covert operatives in Japanese-occupied China (Canadian-born Chinese who had not been granted citizenship were trained by the British army).

In 1944, with the Japanese position in the Pacific deteriorating rapidly, the IJA mobilized over 500,000 men and launched Operation Ichi-Go, their largest offensive of World War II, to attack the American airbases in China and link up the railway between Manchuria and Vietnam. This brought major cities in Hunan, Henan and Guangxi under Japanese occupation. The failure of Chinese forces to defend these areas encouraged Stilwell to attempt to gain overall command of the Chinese army, and his subsequent showdown with Chiang led to his replacement by Major General [[Albert Coady Wedemeyer]].\n\nBy the end of 1944 [[Chinese Army in India|Chinese troops]] under the command of [[Sun Li-jen]] attacking from India, and those under [[Wei Lihuang]] attacking from [[Yunnan]], joined forces in [[Mong-Yu]], successfully driving the Japanese out of North Burma and securing the [[Ledo Road]], China's vital supply artery.{{sfn|Huang|page=420}} In Spring 1945 the Chinese launched offensives that retook [[Battle of West Hunan|Hunan]] and [[Second Guangxi Campaign|Guangxi]].

As the Japanese occupation of northern French Indochina in 1940 had already cut off supplies from the West to China, the move into southern French Indochina was viewed as a direct threat to British and Dutch colonies. Many principal figures in the Japanese government and military (particularly the navy) were against the move, as they foresaw that it would invite retaliation from the West.\n\n[[File:FreeThaiinChina.jpg|thumb|left|[[Free Thai Movement|Free Thai]], American and Chinese military officers in China during the war]]\n\n{{anchor|Oil embargo (Sino-Japanese War)}}\nOn July 24, 1941, Roosevelt requested Japan withdraw all its forces from Indochina.

The economy was sapped by the military demands of a long costly war and internal strife, by spiraling inflation, and by corruption in the Nationalist government that included profiteering, speculation and hoarding.\n\nFurthermore, as part of the Yalta Conference, which allowed a Soviet sphere of influence in Manchuria, the Soviets dismantled and removed more than half of the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese before handing over Manchuria to China. Large swathes of the prime farming areas had been ravaged by the fighting and there was starvation in the wake of the war. Many towns and cities were destroyed, and millions were rendered homeless by floods.\n\nThe problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction after the ravages of a protracted war were staggering, and the war left the Nationalists severely weakened, and their policies left them unpopular. Meanwhile, the war strengthened the Communists both in popularity and as a viable fighting force. At Yan'an and elsewhere in the communist controlled areas, Mao Zedong was able to adapt [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] to Chinese conditions. He taught party cadres to lead the masses by living and working with them, eating their food, and thinking their thoughts.\n\nThe [[Chinese Red Army]] fostered an image of conducting guerrilla warfare in defense of the people. Communist troops adapted to changing wartime conditions and became a seasoned fighting force. With skillful organization and propaganda, the Communists increased party membership from 100,000 in 1937 to 1.2 million by 1945.\n\nMao also began to execute his plan to establish a new China by rapidly moving his forces from Yan'an and elsewhere to Manchuria. This opportunity was available to the Communists because although Nationalist representatives were not invited to Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in the belief that the Soviet Union would cooperate only with the Nationalist government after the war.\n\nHowever, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria was long enough to allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Imperial Japanese Army, quickly establish control in the countryside and move into position to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China. Following that, the Chinese Civil War broke out between the Nationalists and Communists, which concluded with the Communist victory in [[mainland China]] and the retreat of the Nationalists to [[Taiwan]] in 1949.\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:AntijapaneseWarMemorialMuseum.jpg|thumb|China War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial Museum on the site where the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] took place]]\n\nThe question as to which political group directed the Chinese war effort and exerted most of the effort to resist the Japanese remains a controversial issue.\n\nIn the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial near the [[Lugou Bridge|Marco Polo Bridge]] and in mainland Chinese textbooks, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims that the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] mostly avoided fighting the Japanese to preserve their strength for a final showdown with the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC or CCP), while the Communists were the main military force in the Chinese resistance efforts.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Recently, however, with a change in the political climate, the CPC has admitted that certain Nationalist generals made important contributions in resisting the Japanese. The official history in mainland China now states that the KMT fought a bloody, yet indecisive, frontal war against Japan, while the CPC engaged the Japanese forces in far greater numbers behind enemy lines. For the sake of [[Chinese reunification]] and appeasing the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on [[Taiwan]], the PRC has begun to acknowledge the Nationalists and the Communists as equal contributors, because the victory over Japan belonged to the [[Chinese people]], rather than to any political party.<ref name=\"China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender\u2014New York Times\">{{Cite news\n|title=China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender\n|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7D81431F937A3575AC0A9639C8B63&scp=1&sq=Hu%20jintao%20Victory%20Japan&st=cse\n|work=New York Times\n|date=September 4, 2005\n| first=Joseph\n| last=Kahn\n| accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Nationalists suffered higher casualties because they were the main combatants opposing the Japanese in each of the 22 major battles (involving more than 100,000 troops on both sides) between China and Japan. The Communist forces, by contrast, usually avoided pitched battles with the Japanese and generally limited their combat to guerilla actions (the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] are notable exceptions). The Nationalists committed their strongest divisions in early battle against the Japanese (including the 36th, 87th, 88th divisions, the crack divisions of Chiang's Central Army) to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]] and continued to deploy most of their forces to fight the Japanese even as the Communists changed their strategy to engage mainly in a political offensive against the Japanese while declaring that the CPC should \"save and preserve our strength and wait for favorable timing\" by the end of 1941.<ref>Yang Kuisong, \"The Formation and Implementation of the Chinese Communists' Guerrilla Warfare Strategy in the Enemy's Rear during the Sino-Japanese War\", paper presented at Harvard University Conference on Wartime China, Maui, January 2004, pp. 32\u201336</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===China-Japan relations===\nToday, the war is a major point of contention and resentment between China and Japan.

Japan's position has been to avoid commenting on Taiwan's status, maintaining that Japan renounced all claims to sovereignty over its former colonial possessions after World War II, including Taiwan.<ref>[http://home.kyodo.co.jp/modules/fstStory/index.php?storyid=453676]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} FOCUS: Taiwan\u2013Japan ties back on shaky ground as Taipei snubs Tokyo envoy</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the [[Republic of China]] government has held celebrations marking the [[Victory Day]] on September 9 (now known as [[Armed Forces Day]]) and Taiwan's [[Retrocession Day]] on October 25. However, after the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[2000 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election]] in 2000, these national holidays commemorating the war have been cancelled as the [[Taiwan Independence|pro-independent]] DPP does not see the relevancy of celebrating events that happened in mainland China.\n\nMeanwhile, many KMT supporters, particularly veterans who retreated with the government in 1949, still have an emotional interest in the war. For example, in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of war in 2005, the cultural bureau of KMT stronghold [[Taipei]] held a series of talks in the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] regarding the war and post-war developments, while the KMT held its own exhibit in the KMT headquarters. Whereas the KMT won the [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election]] in 2008, the ROC government resumed commemorating the war.\n\n===Japanese women left behind in China===\n{{Main|Japanese people in China}}\n\nSeveral thousand Japanese who were sent as colonizers to [[Manchukuo]] and Inner Mongolia were left behind in China.

From 1937 to 1941, 185,647 Japanese soldiers were killed in China and 520,000 were wounded. Disease also incurred critical losses on Japanese forces. From 1937 to 1941, 430,000 Japanese soldiers were recorded as being sick.
