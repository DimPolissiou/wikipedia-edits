These are not tied by very strong musical similarities, but a certain whimsicality, touches of [[psychedelia]], rather abstruse lyrics, and a use of [[improvisation]] derived from [[jazz]] are common elements in their work.<ref name=\"AM-CS\"/> \"The real essence of 'Canterbury Sound' is the tension between complicated harmonies, extended improvisations, and the sincere desire to write catchy pop songs.\" \"In the very best Canterbury music...the musically silly and the musically serious are juxtaposed in an amusing and endearing way.\"<ref>RareVinylNetwork.

[[Didier Malherbe]] (of [[Gong (band)|Gong]]) has defined the scene as having \"certain chord changes, in particular the use of minor second chords, certain harmonic combinations, and a great clarity in the aesthetics, and a way of improvising that is very different from what is done in jazz.\"<ref name=\"whatis\">What is Canterbury music? at Calyx, a website about the Canterbury scene. Available at: http://www.calyx-canterbury.fr/index/whatis.html</ref>\n\nThere is debate about the existence and definition of the scene. [[Dave Stewart (keyboardist)|Dave Stewart]] has complained at the nomenclature as he and many other musicians identified with the Canterbury scene never had anything to do with Canterbury, the place. The former Soft Machine bassist [[Hugh Hopper]], who lived in [[Whitstable]], near Canterbury, said: \"I think it's a rather artificial label, a journalistic thing... I don't mind it, but people like [[Robert Wyatt|Robert [Wyatt]]], he in fact hates that idea, because he was born somewhere else and just happened to go to school here. In the time when [[the Wilde Flowers]] started we hardly ever worked in Canterbury. It wasn't until Robert and [[Daevid Allen|Daevid [Allen]]] went to London to start Soft Machine that anything happened at all. They weren't really a Canterbury band [...] if it helps people understand or listen to more music then it is fine.\"<ref name=\"whatis\"/>\n\nHopper's family, however, lived in the city and [[the Wilde Flowers]] did play many of their early gigs in Canterbury, notably at the Beehive Club, in Dover Street, and the city's various colleges. It was at a Students Union-organised event at Canterbury Technical College that [[Soft Machine]] gigged with [[Pink Floyd]] \u2013 twice, before and after Floyd were signed to a record deal, and it was in a house in [[Whitstable]] (within the Canterbury City Council area) that [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]] went into rehearsal for some months before moving to London and a recording contract.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==History==\nThe scene had one main root in [[the Wilde Flowers]], a band formed in 1964 which at various times was home to most of the founding musicians of both [[Soft Machine]] and [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]], which in turn provided the musicians for several later bands. The genesis of the 'Canterbury Sound' may, in part, be traced back to 1960, when 22-year-old [[Australia]]n [[beatnik]] [[Daevid Allen]] lodged at 15-year-old [[Robert Wyatt]]'s parents' guest-house in [[Lydden]], ten miles to the south of Canterbury. Allen brought with him an extensive collection of jazz records, a different lifestyle, and the jazz drummer George Niedorf who later taught Wyatt the drums. In 1963, Wyatt, Allen and Hugh Hopper formed the Daevid Allen Trio (in [[London]]) which metamorphosed into the Wilde Flowers the following year 1964 when Allen left for [[France]]. Wyatt, Allen, [[Kevin Ayers]] (from the Wilde Flowers) and [[Mike Ratledge]] (who had played on occasion with the Daevid Allen Trio) formed Soft Machine two years later in 1966.\n\nThe Wilde Flowers survived, however, led by [[Pye Hastings]] \u2013 often joined by his brother [[Jimmy Hastings]] who guested with the Wilde Flowers and Caravan when not busy with his other, jazz, engagements. From this second Wilde Flowers incarnation was born the band Caravan with an initial line up of Pye Hastings (vocals, lead guitar), [[Richard Sinclair]] (bass), [[Dave Sinclair]] (keyboards) and [[Richard Coughlan]] (drums). Although enjoying success in the UK, holding their own with respectable album sales, they really came into their own in mainland Europe, particularly France, the Netherlands and Germany, where they achieved star status in the 1970s and played some of those countries' largest and most prestigious venues. They went quiet during the 1980s, but Caravan reappeared, still led by Hastings, in the 1990s and were gigging into the 2000s, at home and abroad, including in the US.\n\nOther key early bands were [[Delivery (band)|Delivery]] and [[Egg (band)|Egg]], whose members blended into the Canterbury scene in the early 1970s. For example, guitarist [[Phil Miller]] of Delivery went on to found [[Matching Mole]] with Robert Wyatt, and [[Hatfield and the North]] with keyboardist [[Dave Stewart (keyboardist)|Dave Stewart]] of Egg. Both were later in [[National Health]] while guitarist [[Steve Hillage]], who dropped out of a degree course at the [[University of Kent]] at Canterbury, had worked with the members of Egg in a previous band, [[Uriel]] (recorded as Arzachel), and was later in [[Gong (band)|Gong]] with Daevid Allen.\n\nThe Canterbury scene is known for having a set of musicians who often rotated into different Canterbury bands. Bassist/vocalist [[Richard Sinclair]], for example, was at different points of his career, in the Wilde Flowers, [[Camel (band)|Camel]], Caravan, Hatfield and the North and, briefly, [[Gilgamesh (band)|Gilgamesh]]; he also worked with National Health. His cousin keyboardist [[Dave Sinclair]] was in Caravan, Camel, Matching Mole and, briefly, Hatfield and the North. Drummer/vocalist [[Robert Wyatt]] was a member of the Wilde Flowers, Soft Machine, Matching Mole, and also did work as a solo artist. The late drummer [[Pip Pyle]] was in Delivery, Gong, Hatfield and the North, National Health, [[Soft Heap (band)|Soft Heap]] and In Cahoots. Bassist [[Hugh Hopper]] was in Soft Machine, [[Isotope (band)|Isotope]], Soft Heap, In Cahoots and, with Pyle and Allen, [[Brainville (band)|Brainville]], as well as doing numerous of his own group and solo projects and working with non-Canterbury bands. Multi-instrumentalist [[Mike Oldfield]] started his professional career in bassist/guitarist/vocalist Kevin Ayers' band 'The Whole World' in 1970 as the bassist and lead guitarist; some musicians of the Canterbury scene contributed to Oldfield's mid-1970s solo output, such as [[bassoon]] and [[oboe]] player [[Lindsay Cooper]] (on ''[[Hergest Ridge]]'') and guitarist Steve Hillage, keyboardist [[Mike Ratledge]] and multi-instrumentalist [[Fred Frith]] (in a 1974 BBC live performance of extracts from ''Tubular Bells''). \n \nOther individuals peripheral to the scene but with connections include [[Bill Bruford]] (ex-Yes, briefly drummed in Gong and National Health and employed [[Dave Stewart (keyboardist)|Dave Stewart]] in his late 1970s band, Bruford), guitarist [[Allan Holdsworth]] (who worked with Soft Machine, Gong in their jazz rock period, and the band, Bruford, which played a style of jazz fusion heavily influenced by Canterbury scene artists) and guitarist [[Andy Summers]] (who was briefly a member of Soft Machine, and also worked separately with Kevin Ayers). Poet, painter, singer [[Lady June]] has been regarded an \"honorary member\" of the Canterbury scene for having performed and recorded with some of the members, and being a \"landlady\" to many in her flat in [[Maida Vale]], London.<ref>{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=lady-junes-linguistic-leprosy-r42742/review|pure_url=yes}} | title = Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy | work = [[AllMusic]] | last = Unterberger | first = Richie | authorlink = Richie Unterberger | accessdate = 21 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-lady-june-1099325.html | title = Obituary: Lady June | work = [[The Independent]] | last = Salewicz | first = Chris | date = 11 June 1999 | accessdate = 21 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Retrospectives===\nA set of four CDs of archival recordings from the early Canterbury scene (1962\u20131972), entitled ''[[Canterburied Sounds, Vol.s 1-4]]''  was released by [[Brian Hopper]] on [[Voiceprint Records]] in 1998.

Anything outside its delimiters is not processed by PHP, although non-PHP text is still subject to [[control structure]]s described in PHP code. The most common delimiters are <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?php</syntaxhighlight> to open and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>?></syntaxhighlight> to close PHP sections. The shortened form <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?</syntaxhighlight> also exists.

However, before PHP&nbsp;7.0, type hints could not be used with scalar types such as integer or string.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" />\n\nUnlike function and class names, variable names are case sensitive.

' old.';\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the output of the above sample program is 'I am currently {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 1995}} years old.'\n\nIn lieu of [[function pointer]]s, functions in PHP can be referenced by a string containing their name. In this manner, normal PHP functions can be used, for example, as [[Callback function|callbacks]] or within [[function table]]s.<ref name=\"variable-functions\" /> User-defined functions may be created at any time without being [[Function prototype|prototyped]].<ref name=\"functions\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.user-defined.php\n| title = User-defined functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref><ref name=\"variable-functions\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.variable-functions.php\n| title = Variable functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> Functions may be defined inside code blocks, permitting a [[dynamic dispatch|run-time decision]] as to whether or not a function should be defined. There is a <code>function_exists</code> function that determines whether a function with a given name has already been defined. Function calls must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class [[constructor (computer science)|constructor]] functions called with the PHP operator <code>new</code>, in which case parentheses are optional.\n\nUntil PHP 5.3, support for [[anonymous functions]] and [[Closure (computer science)|closures]] did not exist in PHP. While <code>create_function()</code> has existed since PHP&nbsp;4.0.1, it is merely a thin wrapper around <code>eval()</code> that allows normal PHP functions to be created during program execution.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.create-function.php\n| title = create_function() (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> PHP&nbsp;5.3 added syntax to define an anonymous function or \"closure\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php\n| title = Anonymous functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> which can capture variables from the surrounding scope:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction getAdder($x)\n{\n    return function($y) use ($x) {\n        return $x + $y;\n    };\n}\n\n$adder = getAdder(8);\necho $adder(2); // prints \"10\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the example above, <code>getAdder()</code> function creates a closure using passed argument {{code|lang=php|code=$x}} (the keyword <code>use</code> imports a variable from the lexical context), which takes an additional argument {{code|lang=php|code=$y}}, and returns the created closure to the caller. Such a function is a first-class object, meaning that it can be stored in a variable, passed as a [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]] to other functions, etc.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures\n| title = Request for Comments: Lambda functions and closures\n| date = 2008-07-01 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| author1 = Christian Seiler | author2 = Dmitry Stogov\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nUnusually for a dynamically typed language, PHP supports type declarations on function parameters, which are enforced at runtime. This has been supported for classes and interfaces since PHP&nbsp;5.0, for arrays since PHP&nbsp;5.1, for \"callables\" since PHP&nbsp;5.4, and scalar (integer, float, string and boolean) types since PHP&nbsp;7.0.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" /> PHP&nbsp;7.0 also has type declarations for function return types, expressed by placing the type name after the list of parameters, preceded by a colon.<ref name=\"return-types\" /> For example, the <code>getAdder</code> function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like so in PHP&nbsp;7:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction getAdder(int $x): Closure\n{\n    return function(int $y) use ($x): int\n    {\n        return $x + $y;\n    };\n}\n\n$adder = getAdder(8);\necho $adder(2); // prints \"10\"\necho $adder(null); // throws an exception because an incorrect type was passed\n$adder = getAdder([]); // would also throw an exception\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBy default, scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles. So, for example, if a parameter's type is <code>int</code>, PHP would allow not only integers, but also convertible numeric strings, floats or booleans to be passed to that function, and would convert them.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" /> However, PHP&nbsp;7 has a \"strict typing\" mode which, when used, disallows such conversions for function calls and returns within a file.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" />\n\n=== PHP Objects ===\nBasic [[object-oriented programming]] functionality was added in PHP&nbsp;3 and improved in PHP&nbsp;4.<ref name=\"about PHP\" /> This allowed for PHP to gain further abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the language. Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP&nbsp;5, expanding the feature set and enhancing performance.<ref name=\"php 5 objects\" /> In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like [[value type]]s.<ref name=\"php 5 objects\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=http://mjtsai.com/blog/2004/07/15/php-5-object-references/|title=PHP&nbsp;5 Object References |website=mjtsai.com}}</ref> The drawback of this method was that code had to make heavy use of PHP's \"reference\" variables if it wanted to modify an object it was passed rather than creating a copy of it. In the new approach, objects are referenced by [[handle (computing)|handle]], and not by value.\n\nPHP 5 introduced private and protected [[member variable]]s and methods, along with [[abstract type|abstract classes]], [[final type|final classes]], [[abstract method]]s, and [[final method]]s. It also introduced a standard way of declaring [[constructor (computer science)|constructors]] and [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], similar to that of other object-oriented languages such as [[C++]], and a standard [[exception handling]] model. Furthermore, PHP&nbsp;5 added [[interface (computing)|interfaces]] and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. [[object (computer science)|Objects]] implementing ArrayAccess can be used with [[array data type|array]] syntax and objects implementing [[Iterator]] or [[IteratorAggregate]] can be used with the <code>foreach</code> [[language construct]]. There is no [[virtual table]] feature in the engine, so [[static variable]]s are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.<ref name=\"zend engine 2\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=http://www.php.net/zend-engine-2.php|title=Classes and Objects (PHP&nbsp;5) |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nIf the developer creates a copy of an object using the reserved word <code>clone</code>, the Zend engine will check whether a <code>__clone()</code> method has been defined. If not, it will call a default <code>__clone()</code> which will copy the object's properties. If a <code>__clone()</code> method is defined, then it will be responsible for setting the necessary properties in the created object. For convenience, the engine will supply a function that imports the properties of the source object, so the programmer can start with a by-value [[wikt:replica|replica]] of the source object and only override properties that need to be changed.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/language.oop5.cloning|title=Object cloning |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nThe following is a basic example of [[object-oriented programming]] in PHP:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\" line=\"1\">\n<?php\n\nabstract class User\n{\n    public string $name;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name)\n    {\n        $this->name = $name;\n    }\n\n    public function greet(): string\n    {\n        return \"Hello, my name is \" . $this->name;\n    }\n\n    abstract public function job(): string;\n}\n\nclass Student extends User\n{\n    public string $course;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name, string $course)\n    {\n        $this->course = $course;\n        parent::__construct($name);\n    }\n\n    public function job(): string\n    {\n        return \"I learn \" . $this->course;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Teacher extends User\n{\n    public array $teachingCourses;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name, string...$teachingCourses)\n    {\n        $this->teachingCourses = $teachingCourses;\n        parent::__construct($name);\n    }\n\n    public function job(): string\n    {\n        return \"I teach \" . implode(\", \", $this->teachingCourses);\n    }\n}\n\n$students = [\n    new Student(\"Alice\", \"Computer Science\"),\n    new Student(\"Bob\", \"Computer Science\"),\n    new Student(\"Charlie\", \"Business Studies\"),\n];\n$teachers = [\n    new Teacher(\"Dan\", \"Computer Science\", \"Information Security\"),\n    new Teacher(\"Erin\", \"Computer Science\", \"3D Graphics Programming\"),\n    new Teacher(\"Frankie\", \"Online Marketing\", \"Business Studies\", \"E-commerce\"),\n];\n\necho \"Students: \\n\";\nforeach ($students as $student) {\n    echo $student->greet() . \", \" . $student->job() . \"\\n\";\n}\n\necho \"Teachers: \\n\";\nforeach ($teachers as $teacher) {\n    echo $teacher->greet() . \", \" . $teacher->job() . \"\\n\";\n}\n\n// Output of program:\n// Students:\n// Hello, my name is Alice, I learn Computer Science\n// Hello, my name is Bob, I learn Computer Science\n// Hello, my name is Charlie, I learn Business Studies\n// Teachers:\n// Hello, my name is Dan, I teach Computer Science, Information Security\n// Hello, my name is Erin, I teach Computer Science, 3D Graphics Programming\n// Hello, my name is Frankie, I teach Online Marketing, Business Studies, E-commerce\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe [[visibility (computer science)|visibility]] of PHP properties and methods is defined using the [[keyword (computer programming)|keywords]] <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, and <code>protected</code>. The default is public, if only [[variable (programming)|var]] is used; <code>var</code> is a synonym for <code>public</code>. Items declared <code>public</code> can be accessed everywhere. <code>protected</code> limits access to [[inherited class]]es (and to the class that defines the item). <code>private</code> limits visibility only to the class that defines the item.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theserverpages.com/php/manual/en/language.oop5.visibility.php |title= Visibility (PHP Manual) |website=theserverpages.com |date=2005-05-19 |access-date=2010-08-26}}</ref> Objects of the same type have access to each other's private and protected members even though they are not the same instance.\n\n== Implementations ==\nThe only complete PHP implementation is the original, known simply as PHP. It is the most widely used and is powered by the [[Zend Engine]]. To disambiguate it from other implementations, it is sometimes unofficially called \"Zend PHP\". The Zend Engine [[Compiler|compiles]] PHP [[source code]] on-the-fly into an internal format that it can execute, thus it works as an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2009-11-04|url=http://www.linux-tutorial.info/modules.php?name=Howto&pagename=Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/languages.html|title=How do computer languages work?}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional |author=Gilmore, W.

Due to the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, it is difficult for competing implementations to offer complete compatibility.\n\nPHP's single-request-per-script-execution model, and the fact the Zend Engine is an interpreter, leads to inefficiency; as a result, various products have been developed to help improve PHP performance. In order to speed up execution time and not have to compile the PHP source code every time the web page is accessed, PHP scripts can also be deployed in the PHP engine's internal format by using an [[opcode]] cache, which works by [[Cache (computing)|caching]] the compiled form of a PHP script (opcodes) in [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]] to avoid the overhead of [[parsing]] and [[compiling]] the code every time the script runs. An opcode cache, [[Zend Opcache]], is built into PHP since version 5.5.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = [VOTE] Integrating Zend Optimizer+ into the PHP distribution\n| url = http://news.php.net/php.internals/66531\n| access-date = 2013-03-08\n| website = news.php.net\n}}</ref> Another example of a widely used opcode cache is the [[Alternative PHP Cache]] (APC), which is available as a [[PHP Extension Community Library|PECL]] extension.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php\n| title = Alternative PHP Cache\n| access-date = 2013-09-21\n| website = PHP.net\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile Zend PHP is still the most popular implementation, several other implementations have been developed. Some of these are [[compiler]]s or support [[JIT compilation]], and hence offer performance benefits over Zend PHP at the expense of lacking full PHP compatibility. Alternative implementations include the following:\n\n* [[HHVM]] (HipHop Virtual Machine)&nbsp;\u2013 developed at Facebook and available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly known as an [[intermediate language]]), which is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically at runtime by a [[Just-in-time compiler|just-in-time]] (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6\u00d7 performance improvements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhvm.com/blog/2813/we-are-the-98-5-and-the-16 |title=We are the 98.5% (and the 16%) \u00ab HipHop Virtual Machine |website=hhvm.com |date=December 2013 |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref> However, since version 7.2 Zend has outperformed HHVM,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kinsta.com/blog/php-benchmarks/|title=The Definitive PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 & 7.3 Benchmarks (2019)|date=2019-01-14|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> and HHVM 3.24 is the last version to officially support PHP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3226489/web-development/forget-php-facebooks-hhvm-engine-switches-to-hack-instead.html|title=Forget PHP!

If PHP has no module support for a web server, it can always be used as a [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) or [[FastCGI]] processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP's CGI executable to process all requests to PHP files.<ref name=\"installation\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.general.php\n| title = General Installation Considerations\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nPHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative FastCGI implementation for PHP, bundled with the official PHP distribution since version 5.3.3.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-07-22-2\n| title = News Archive: PHP&nbsp;5.3.3 Released!\n| date = 2010-07-22\n| website = php.net}}</ref> When compared to the older FastCGI implementation, it contains some additional features, mostly useful for heavily loaded web servers.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php\n| title = FastCGI Process Manager (FPM)\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen using PHP for command-line scripting, a PHP [[command-line interface]] (CLI) executable is needed. PHP supports a CLI [[server application programming interface]] (SAPI) as of PHP&nbsp;4.3.0.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.introduction.php\n| title = Command line usage: Introduction\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> The main focus of this SAPI is developing [[command line interface|shell]] applications using PHP.

This form is what is known as a SAPI.\n\nThere are different kinds of SAPIs for various web server extensions. For example, in addition to those listed above, other SAPIs for the PHP language include the [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) and [[command-line interface]] (CLI).<ref name=\"php-installation2\" /><ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.introduction.php|title = Command line usage: Introduction|access-date = 2013-09-22|website = php.net}}</ref>\n\nPHP can also be used for writing desktop [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) applications, by using the [[PHP-GTK]] extension. PHP-GTK is not included in the official PHP distribution,<ref name=\"installation\" /> and as an extension it can be used only with PHP versions 5.1.0 and newer.

Anything outside its delimiters is not processed by PHP, although non-PHP text is still subject to [[control structure]]s described in PHP code. The most common delimiters are <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?php</syntaxhighlight> to open and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>?></syntaxhighlight> to close PHP sections. The shortened form <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?</syntaxhighlight> also exists.

PHP&nbsp;5 introduced ''type hinting'' that allows functions to force their parameters to be objects of a specific class, arrays, interfaces or [[callback function]]s. However, before PHP&nbsp;7.0, type hints could not be used with scalar types such as integer or string.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" />\n\nUnlike function and class names, variable names are case sensitive. Both double-quoted (\"\") and [[heredoc]] strings provide the ability to interpolate a variable's value into the string.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.php|title=Variables |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> PHP treats [[newline]]s as [[whitespace character|whitespace]] in the manner of a [[free-form language]], and statements are terminated by a semicolon.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/basic-syntax.instruction-separation|title=Instruction separation |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> PHP has three types of [[comparison of programming languages (syntax)#Comments|comment syntax]]: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>/* */</syntaxhighlight> marks block and inline comments; <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>//</syntaxhighlight> or <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>#</syntaxhighlight> are used for one-line comments.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.comments.php|title=Comments |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> The <code>echo</code> statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text.\n\nIn terms of keywords and language syntax, PHP is similar to the C style syntax. <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>if</syntaxhighlight> conditions, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>for</syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>while</syntaxhighlight> loops, and function returns are similar in syntax to languages such as C, C++, C#, Java and Perl.\n\n=== Data types ===\nPHP stores integers in a platform-dependent range, either as a 32, 64 or 128-bit [[signed number representations|signed]] [[integer (computer science)|integer]] equivalent to the [[C variable types and declarations|C-language long type]]. Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in certain situations, which is different behavior to many other programming languages.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/03/27/integers-in-php-running-with-scissors-and-portability/ | title = Integers in PHP, running with scissors, and portability | date = March 27, 2007 | publisher = MySQL Performance Blog | access-date = 2007-03-28}}</ref> Integer variables can be assigned using decimal (positive and negative), [[octal]], [[hexadecimal]], and [[Binary code|binary]] notations.\n\n[[Floating point]] numbers are also stored in a platform-specific range. They can be specified using floating point notation, or two forms of [[scientific notation]].<ref name=\"types\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.php|title=Types |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> PHP has a native [[Boolean datatype|Boolean]] type that is similar to the native Boolean types in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C++]]. Using the Boolean type conversion rules, non-zero values are interpreted as true and zero as false, as in [[Perl]] and C++.<ref name=\"types\" />\n\nThe null data type represents a variable that has no value; <code>NULL</code> is the only allowed value for this data type.<ref name=\"types\" />\n\nVariables of the \"resource\" type represent references to resources from external sources. These are typically created by functions from a particular extension, and can only be processed by functions from the same extension; examples include file, image, and database resources.<ref name=\"types\" />\n\nArrays can contain elements of any type that PHP can handle, including resources, objects, and even other arrays. Order is preserved in lists of values and in [[hash table|hashes]] with both keys and values, and the two can be intermingled.<ref name=\"types\" /> PHP also supports [[string (computing)|strings]], which can be used with single quotes, double quotes, nowdoc or [[heredoc]] syntax.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-21|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php|title=Strings |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nThe Standard PHP Library (SPL) attempts to solve standard problems and implements efficient data access interfaces and classes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.php.net/spl | title = SPL&nbsp;\u2013 StandardPHPLibrary | date = March 16, 2009 | website = PHP.net | access-date = 2009-03-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Functions ===\nPHP defines a large array of functions in the core language and many are also available in various extensions; these functions are well documented in the online PHP documentation.<ref name=\"functions\" /> However, the built-in library has a wide variety of naming conventions and associated inconsistencies, as described under [[#History|history]] above.\n\nCustom functions may be defined by the developer:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction myAge(int $birthYear): string\n{\n    // calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year.\n    $yearsOld = date('Y') - $birthYear;\n\n    // return the age in a descriptive string.\n    return $yearsOld . ' year' . ($yearsOld != 1 ? 's':'');\n}\n\necho 'I am currently ' . myAge(1995) . ' old.';\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the output of the above sample program is 'I am currently {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 1995}} years old.'\n\nIn lieu of [[function pointer]]s, functions in PHP can be referenced by a string containing their name. In this manner, normal PHP functions can be used, for example, as [[Callback function|callbacks]] or within [[function table]]s.<ref name=\"variable-functions\" /> User-defined functions may be created at any time without being [[Function prototype|prototyped]].<ref name=\"functions\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.user-defined.php\n| title = User-defined functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref><ref name=\"variable-functions\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.variable-functions.php\n| title = Variable functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> Functions may be defined inside code blocks, permitting a [[dynamic dispatch|run-time decision]] as to whether or not a function should be defined. There is a <code>function_exists</code> function that determines whether a function with a given name has already been defined. Function calls must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class [[constructor (computer science)|constructor]] functions called with the PHP operator <code>new</code>, in which case parentheses are optional.\n\nUntil PHP 5.3, support for [[anonymous functions]] and [[Closure (computer science)|closures]] did not exist in PHP. While <code>create_function()</code> has existed since PHP&nbsp;4.0.1, it is merely a thin wrapper around <code>eval()</code> that allows normal PHP functions to be created during program execution.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.create-function.php\n| title = create_function() (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> PHP&nbsp;5.3 added syntax to define an anonymous function or \"closure\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php\n| title = Anonymous functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> which can capture variables from the surrounding scope:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction getAdder($x)\n{\n    return function($y) use ($x) {\n        return $x + $y;\n    };\n}\n\n$adder = getAdder(8);\necho $adder(2); // prints \"10\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the example above, <code>getAdder()</code> function creates a closure using passed argument {{code|lang=php|code=$x}} (the keyword <code>use</code> imports a variable from the lexical context), which takes an additional argument {{code|lang=php|code=$y}}, and returns the created closure to the caller. Such a function is a first-class object, meaning that it can be stored in a variable, passed as a [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]] to other functions, etc.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures\n| title = Request for Comments: Lambda functions and closures\n| date = 2008-07-01 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| author1 = Christian Seiler | author2 = Dmitry Stogov\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nUnusually for a dynamically typed language, PHP supports type declarations on function parameters, which are enforced at runtime. This has been supported for classes and interfaces since PHP&nbsp;5.0, for arrays since PHP&nbsp;5.1, for \"callables\" since PHP&nbsp;5.4, and scalar (integer, float, string and boolean) types since PHP&nbsp;7.0.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" /> PHP&nbsp;7.0 also has type declarations for function return types, expressed by placing the type name after the list of parameters, preceded by a colon.<ref name=\"return-types\" /> For example, the <code>getAdder</code> function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like so in PHP&nbsp;7:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction getAdder(int $x): Closure\n{\n    return function(int $y) use ($x): int\n    {\n        return $x + $y;\n    };\n}\n\n$adder = getAdder(8);\necho $adder(2); // prints \"10\"\necho $adder(null); // throws an exception because an incorrect type was passed\n$adder = getAdder([]); // would also throw an exception\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBy default, scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles. So, for example, if a parameter's type is <code>int</code>, PHP would allow not only integers, but also convertible numeric strings, floats or booleans to be passed to that function, and would convert them.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" /> However, PHP&nbsp;7 has a \"strict typing\" mode which, when used, disallows such conversions for function calls and returns within a file.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" />\n\n=== PHP Objects ===\nBasic [[object-oriented programming]] functionality was added in PHP&nbsp;3 and improved in PHP&nbsp;4.<ref name=\"about PHP\" /> This allowed for PHP to gain further abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the language. Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP&nbsp;5, expanding the feature set and enhancing performance.<ref name=\"php 5 objects\" /> In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like [[value type]]s.<ref name=\"php 5 objects\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=http://mjtsai.com/blog/2004/07/15/php-5-object-references/|title=PHP&nbsp;5 Object References |website=mjtsai.com}}</ref> The drawback of this method was that code had to make heavy use of PHP's \"reference\" variables if it wanted to modify an object it was passed rather than creating a copy of it. In the new approach, objects are referenced by [[handle (computing)|handle]], and not by value.\n\nPHP 5 introduced private and protected [[member variable]]s and methods, along with [[abstract type|abstract classes]], [[final type|final classes]], [[abstract method]]s, and [[final method]]s. It also introduced a standard way of declaring [[constructor (computer science)|constructors]] and [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], similar to that of other object-oriented languages such as [[C++]], and a standard [[exception handling]] model. Furthermore, PHP&nbsp;5 added [[interface (computing)|interfaces]] and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. [[object (computer science)|Objects]] implementing ArrayAccess can be used with [[array data type|array]] syntax and objects implementing [[Iterator]] or [[IteratorAggregate]] can be used with the <code>foreach</code> [[language construct]]. There is no [[virtual table]] feature in the engine, so [[static variable]]s are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.<ref name=\"zend engine 2\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=http://www.php.net/zend-engine-2.php|title=Classes and Objects (PHP&nbsp;5) |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nIf the developer creates a copy of an object using the reserved word <code>clone</code>, the Zend engine will check whether a <code>__clone()</code> method has been defined.

It is the most widely used and is powered by the [[Zend Engine]]. To disambiguate it from other implementations, it is sometimes unofficially called \"Zend PHP\". The Zend Engine [[Compiler|compiles]] PHP [[source code]] on-the-fly into an internal format that it can execute, thus it works as an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2009-11-04|url=http://www.linux-tutorial.info/modules.php?name=Howto&pagename=Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/languages.html|title=How do computer languages work?}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional |author=Gilmore, W.

Due to the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, it is difficult for competing implementations to offer complete compatibility.\n\nPHP's single-request-per-script-execution model, and the fact the Zend Engine is an interpreter, leads to inefficiency; as a result, various products have been developed to help improve PHP performance. In order to speed up execution time and not have to compile the PHP source code every time the web page is accessed, PHP scripts can also be deployed in the PHP engine's internal format by using an [[opcode]] cache, which works by [[Cache (computing)|caching]] the compiled form of a PHP script (opcodes) in [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]] to avoid the overhead of [[parsing]] and [[compiling]] the code every time the script runs. An opcode cache, [[Zend Opcache]], is built into PHP since version 5.5.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = [VOTE] Integrating Zend Optimizer+ into the PHP distribution\n| url = http://news.php.net/php.internals/66531\n| access-date = 2013-03-08\n| website = news.php.net\n}}</ref> Another example of a widely used opcode cache is the [[Alternative PHP Cache]] (APC), which is available as a [[PHP Extension Community Library|PECL]] extension.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php\n| title = Alternative PHP Cache\n| access-date = 2013-09-21\n| website = PHP.net\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile Zend PHP is still the most popular implementation, several other implementations have been developed. Some of these are [[compiler]]s or support [[JIT compilation]], and hence offer performance benefits over Zend PHP at the expense of lacking full PHP compatibility. Alternative implementations include the following:\n\n* [[HHVM]] (HipHop Virtual Machine)&nbsp;\u2013 developed at Facebook and available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly known as an [[intermediate language]]), which is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically at runtime by a [[Just-in-time compiler|just-in-time]] (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6\u00d7 performance improvements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhvm.com/blog/2813/we-are-the-98-5-and-the-16 |title=We are the 98.5% (and the 16%) \u00ab HipHop Virtual Machine |website=hhvm.com |date=December 2013 |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref> However, since version 7.2 Zend has outperformed HHVM,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kinsta.com/blog/php-benchmarks/|title=The Definitive PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 & 7.3 Benchmarks (2019)|date=2019-01-14|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> and HHVM 3.24 is the last version to officially support PHP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3226489/web-development/forget-php-facebooks-hhvm-engine-switches-to-hack-instead.html|title=Forget PHP!

Some other web servers, such as OmniHTTPd, support the [[Internet Server Application Programming Interface]] (ISAPI), which is a [[Microsoft]]'s web server module interface. If PHP has no module support for a web server, it can always be used as a [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) or [[FastCGI]] processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP's CGI executable to process all requests to PHP files.<ref name=\"installation\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.general.php\n| title = General Installation Considerations\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nPHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative FastCGI implementation for PHP, bundled with the official PHP distribution since version 5.3.3.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-07-22-2\n| title = News Archive: PHP&nbsp;5.3.3 Released!\n| date = 2010-07-22\n| website = php.net}}</ref> When compared to the older FastCGI implementation, it contains some additional features, mostly useful for heavily loaded web servers.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php\n| title = FastCGI Process Manager (FPM)\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen using PHP for command-line scripting, a PHP [[command-line interface]] (CLI) executable is needed.

However, several alternatives have been used, including ''The Miserables'', ''The Wretched'', ''The Miserable Ones'', ''The Poor Ones'', ''The Wretched Poor'', ''The Victims'' and ''The Dispossessed''.<ref>Novelist Susanne Alleyn has argued that \"the phrase \u201cles mis\u00e9rables\u201d, which has a whole range of subtly shaded meanings in French, is much better translated into English as \u201cthe dispossessed\u201d or even as \u201cthe outsiders\u201d, which can describe every major character in the novel in one way or another, than simply as \u201cthe miserable ones\u201d / \u201cthe wretched ones.\u201d [http://hfebooks.com/no-its-not-actually-the-french-revolution-les-miserables-and-history-by-susanne-alleyn/ No, It\u2019s Not Actually the French Revolution: Les Mis\u00e9rables and History.]</ref> Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 [[June Rebellion]] in [[Paris]], the novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict [[Jean Valjean]] and his experience of redemption.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11437196|title=BBC News \u2013 Bon anniversaire! 25 facts about Les Mis|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=1 October 2010|date=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nExamining the nature of law and grace, the novel elaborates upon the [[history of France]], the architecture and urban design of Paris, politics, [[moral philosophy]], [[antimonarchism]], justice, religion, and the types and nature of [[romantic love|romantic]] and familial love. ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' has been popularized through numerous [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables|adaptations]] for film, television and the stage, including a musical.\n\n== Novel form ==\n[[Upton Sinclair]] described the novel as \"one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world\", and remarked that Hugo set forth the purpose of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in the ''Preface'':<ref>{{cite book|last=Sinclair|first=Upton|title=The Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest|year=1915|publisher=charlesrivereditors.com Charles Rivers Editors|isbn=978-1-247-96345-7|url=http://www.bartleby.com/71/0405.html}}</ref> {{Quote|text=So long as there shall exist, by reason of law and custom, a social condemnation, which, in the face of civilization, artificially creates hells on earth, and complicates a destiny that is divine with human fatality; so long as the three problems of the age\u2014the degradation of man by poverty, the ruin of women by starvation, and the dwarfing of childhood by physical and spiritual night\u2014are not solved; so long as, in certain regions, social asphyxia shall be possible; in other words, and from a yet more extended point of view, so long as ignorance and misery remain on earth, books like this cannot be useless.}}\n\nTowards the end of the novel, Hugo explains the work's overarching structure:<ref>Alexander Welsh, \"Opening and Closing ''Les Mis\u00e9rables''\", in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Victor Hugo: Modern Critical Views'' (NY: Chelsea House, 1988), 155; Vol. 5, Book 1, Chapter 20</ref>\n{{quote|The book which the reader has before him at this moment is, from one end to the other, in its entirety and details&nbsp;... a progress from evil to good, from injustice to justice, from falsehood to truth, from night to day, from appetite to conscience, from corruption to life; from bestiality to duty, from hell to heaven, from nothingness to God. The starting point: matter, destination: the soul. The [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]] at the beginning, the angel at the end.}}\n\nThe novel contains various subplots, but the main thread is the story of ex-convict [[Jean Valjean]], who becomes a force for good in the world but cannot escape his criminal past. The novel is divided into five volumes, each volume divided into several books, and subdivided into chapters, for a total of 48 books and 365 chapters. Each chapter is relatively short, commonly no longer than a few pages.\n\nThe novel as a whole is one of the [[List of longest novels|longest ever written]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/22F3SA74XBA5Y |title=Read the Ten Longest Novels Ever Written |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref> with 655,478 words in the original French. Hugo explained his ambitions for the novel to his Italian publisher:<ref>Behr, ''Complete Book'', 39\u201342</ref>\n{{quote|I don't know whether it will be read by everyone, but it is meant for everyone. It addresses England as well as Spain, Italy as well as France, Germany as well as Ireland, the republics that harbour slaves as well as empires that have serfs. Social problems go beyond frontiers. Humankind's wounds, those huge sores that litter the world, do not stop at the blue and red lines drawn on maps. Wherever men go in ignorance or despair, wherever women sell themselves for bread, wherever children lack a book to learn from or a warm hearth, ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' knocks at the door and says: \"open up, I am here for you\".}}\n\n=== Digressions ===\nMore than a quarter of the novel\u2014by one count 955 of 2,783 pages\u2014is devoted to essays that argue a moral point or display Hugo's encyclopedic knowledge but do not advance the plot, nor even a subplot, a method Hugo used in such other works as ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' and ''[[Toilers of the Sea]]''. One biographer noted that \"the digressions of genius are easily pardoned\".<ref>A. F. Davidson, ''Victor Hugo: His Life And Work'' (J. B. Lippincott, 1929), Kindle Location 4026, 4189</ref> The topics Hugo addresses include cloistered [[religious order]]s, the construction of the [[Paris sewers]], [[argot]], and the [[street urchin]]s of Paris. The one about convents he titles \"Parenthesis\" to alert the reader to its irrelevance to the story line.<ref>Victor Brombert, \"''Les Mis\u00e9rables'': Salvation from Below\", in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Modern Critical Views: Victor Hugo'' (Chelsea House, 1988), 195</ref>\n\nHugo devotes another 19 chapters (Volume II, Book I) to an account of\u2014and a meditation on the place in history of\u2014the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the battlefield which Hugo visited in 1861 and where he finished writing the novel. It opens volume 2 with such a change of subject as to seem the beginning of an entirely different work. The fact that this 'digression' occupies such a large part of the text demands that it be read in the context of the 'overarching structure' discussed above. Hugo draws his own personal conclusions, taking Waterloo to be a pivot-point in history, but definitely not a victory for the forces of reaction.\n\n{{quote|Waterloo, by cutting short the demolition of European thrones by the sword, had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued in another direction. The slashers have finished; it was the turn of the thinkers. The century that Waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its march. That sinister victory was vanquished by liberty.}}\n\nOne critic has called this \"the spiritual gateway\" to the novel, as its chance encounter of Th\u00e9nardier and Colonel Pontmercy foreshadows so many of the novel's encounters \"blending chance and necessity\", a \"confrontation of heroism and villainy\".<ref>Brombert, \"Salvation from Below,\" 195\u201397</ref>\n\nEven when not turning to other subjects outside his narrative, Hugo sometimes interrupts the straightforward recitation of events, his voice and control of the story line unconstrained by time and sequence. The novel opens with a statement about the bishop of Digne in 1815 and immediately shifts: \"Although these details in no way essentially concern that which we have to tell...\" Only after 14 chapters does Hugo pick up the opening thread again, \"In the early days of the month of October, 1815...\", to introduce Jean Valjean.<ref>Alexander Welsh, \"Opening and Closing ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'',\" in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Modern Critical Views: Victor Hugo'' (Chelsea House, 1988), 151\u201352</ref>\n\n==Hugo's sources==\n[[File:Achille Dev\u00e9ria - Vidocq.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eug\u00e8ne Vidocq]], whose career provided a model for the character of Jean Valjean]]\nAn incident Hugo witnessed in 1829 involved three strangers and a police officer. One of the strangers was a man who had stolen a loaf of bread, similar to [[Jean Valjean]]. The officer was taking him to the coach.

He went to Toulon to visit the Bagne in 1839 and took extensive notes, though he did not start writing the book until 1845. On one of the pages of his notes about the prison, he wrote in large block letters a possible name for his hero: \"JEAN TR\u00c9JEAN\".

He asked his mistresses, [[L\u00e9onie d'Aunet]] and [[Juliette Drouet]], to tell him about life in convents. He also slipped personal anecdotes into the plot.

He sleeps on the street, angry and bitter.\n\nDigne's benevolent [[Bishop Myriel]] gives him shelter. At night, Valjean runs off with Myriel's silverware. When the police capture Valjean, Myriel pretends that he has given the silverware to Valjean and presses him to take two silver candlesticks as well, as if he had forgotten to take them. The police accept his explanation and leave. Myriel tells Valjean that his life has been spared for God, and that he should use money from the silver candlesticks to make an honest man of himself.\n\nValjean broods over Myriel's words. When opportunity presents itself, purely out of habit, he steals a 40-[[Sou (coin)|sous]] coin from 12-year-old Petit Gervais and chases the boy away. He quickly repents and searches the city in panic for Gervais. At the same time, his theft is reported to the authorities. Valjean hides as they search for him, because if apprehended he will be returned to the galleys for life as a repeat offender.\n\nSix years pass and Valjean, using the alias Monsieur Madeleine, has become a wealthy factory owner and is appointed mayor of [[Montreuil-sur-Mer]]. Walking down the street, he sees a man named Fauchelevent pinned under the wheels of a cart. When no one volunteers to lift the cart, even for pay, he decides to rescue Fauchelevent himself. He crawls underneath the cart, manages to lift it, and frees him. The town's police inspector, Inspector [[Javert]], who was an adjutant guard at the Bagne of Toulon during Valjean's incarceration, becomes suspicious of the mayor after witnessing this remarkable feat of strength. He has known only one other man, a convict named Jean Valjean, who could accomplish it.\n\nYears earlier in Paris, a [[Grisette (person)|grisette]] named [[Fantine]] was very much in love with F\u00e9lix Tholomy\u00e8s. His friends, Listolier, Fameuil, and Blachevelle were also paired with Fantine's friends Dahlia, Z\u00e9phine, and Favourite. The men abandon the women, treating their relationships as youthful amusements. Fantine must draw on her own resources to care for her and Tholomy\u00e8s' daughter, [[Cosette]]. When Fantine arrives at [[Montfermeil]], she leaves Cosette in the care of the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], a corrupt innkeeper and his selfish, cruel wife.\n\nFantine is unaware that they are abusing her daughter and using her as forced labor for their inn, and continues to try to meet their growing, extortionate and fictitious demands. She is later fired from her job at Jean Valjean's factory, because of the discovery of her daughter, who was born out of wedlock. Meanwhile, the Th\u00e9nardiers' monetary demands continue to grow. In desperation, Fantine sells her hair and two front teeth, and she resorts to prostitution to pay the Th\u00e9nardiers. Fantine is slowly dying from an unspecified disease.\n\nA [[dandy]] named Bamatabois harasses Fantine in the street, and she reacts by striking him. Javert arrests Fantine. She begs to be released so that she can provide for her daughter, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean (Mayor Madeleine) intervenes and orders Javert to release her. Javert resists but Valjean prevails. Valjean, feeling responsible because his factory turned her away, promises Fantine that he will bring Cosette to her. He takes her to a hospital.\n\nJavert comes to see Valjean again. Javert admits that after being forced to free Fantine, he reported him as Valjean to the French authorities. He tells Valjean he realizes he was wrong, because the authorities have identified someone else as the real Jean Valjean, have him in custody, and plan to try him the next day. Valjean is torn, but decides to reveal himself to save the innocent man, whose real name is Champmathieu. He travels to attend the trial and there reveals his true identity. Valjean returns to Montreuil to see Fantine, followed by Javert, who confronts him in her hospital room.\n\nAfter Javert grabs Valjean, Valjean asks for three days to bring Cosette to Fantine, but Javert refuses. Fantine discovers that Cosette is not at the hospital and fretfully asks where she is. Javert orders her to be quiet, and then reveals to her Valjean's real identity. Weakened by the severity of her illness, she falls back in shock and dies. Valjean goes to Fantine, speaks to her in an inaudible whisper, kisses her hand, and then leaves with Javert. Later, Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public [[Graveyard|grave]].\n\n===Volume II: Cosette===\n[[File:Ebcosette.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of \"[[Cosette]]\" by [[Emile Bayard]], from the original edition of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' (1862)]]\nValjean escapes, is recaptured, and is sentenced to death. The king commutes his sentence to penal servitude for life. While imprisoned in the [[Bagne of Toulon]], Valjean, at great personal risk, rescues a sailor caught in the ship's rigging. Spectators call for his release. Valjean fakes his own death by allowing himself to fall into the ocean. Authorities report him dead and his body lost.\n\nValjean arrives at Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette fetching water in the woods alone and walks with her to the inn. He orders a meal and observes how the Th\u00e9nardiers abuse her, while pampering their own daughters [[\u00c9ponine]] and Azelma, who mistreat Cosette for playing with their doll. Valjean leaves and returns to make Cosette a present of an expensive new doll which, after some hesitation, she happily accepts. \u00c9ponine and Azelma are envious. Madame Th\u00e9nardier is furious with Valjean, while her husband makes light of Valjean's behaviour, caring only that he pay for his food and lodging.\n\nThe next morning, Valjean informs the Th\u00e9nardiers that he wants to take Cosette with him. Madame Th\u00e9nardier immediately accepts, while Th\u00e9nardier pretends to love Cosette and be concerned for her welfare, reluctant to give her up. Valjean pays the Th\u00e9nardiers 1,500 francs, and he and Cosette leave the inn. Th\u00e9nardier, hoping to swindle more out of Valjean, runs after them, holding the 1,500 francs, and tells Valjean he wants Cosette back. He informs Valjean that he cannot release Cosette without a note from the child's mother. Valjean hands Th\u00e9nardier Fantine's letter authorizing the bearer to take Cosette. Th\u00e9nardier then demands that Valjean pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean and Cosette leave. Th\u00e9nardier regrets that he did not bring his gun and turns back toward home.\n\nValjean and Cosette flee to Paris. Valjean rents new lodgings at Gorbeau House, where he and Cosette live happily. However, Javert discovers Valjean's lodgings there a few months later. Valjean takes Cosette and they try to escape from Javert. They soon find shelter in the Petit-Picpus convent with the help of Fauchelevent, the man whom Valjean once rescued from being crushed under a cart and who has become the convent's gardener. Valjean also becomes a gardener and Cosette becomes a student at the convent school.\n\n===Volume III: Marius===\nEight years later, the [[Friends of the ABC]], led by [[Enjolras]], are preparing an act of anti-[[Orl\u00e9anist]] civil unrest (i.e. the [[June Rebellion|Paris uprising on 5\u20136 June 1832]], following the death of [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only French leader who had sympathy towards the working class. Lamarque was a victim of a major cholera epidemic that had ravaged the city, particularly its poor neighborhoods, arousing suspicion that the government had been poisoning wells). The Friends of the ABC are joined by the poor of the ''[[Cour des miracles]]'', including the Th\u00e9nardiers' eldest son [[Gavroche]], who is a [[street urchin]].\n\nOne of the students, [[Marius Pontmercy]], has become alienated from his family (especially his [[Royalism|royalist]] grandfather M. Gillenormand) because of his [[Bonapartism]] views. After the death of his father, Colonel Georges Pontmercy, Marius discovers a note from him instructing his son to provide help to a sergeant named Th\u00e9nardier who saved his life at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]\u2014in reality Th\u00e9nardier was looting corpses and only saved Pontmercy's life by accident; he had called himself a sergeant under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] to avoid exposing himself as a robber.\n\nAt the [[Luxembourg Garden]], Marius falls in love with the now grown and beautiful Cosette. The Th\u00e9nardiers have also moved to Paris and now live in poverty after losing their inn. They live under the surname \"Jondrette\" at Gorbeau House (coincidentally, the same building Valjean and Cosette briefly lived in after leaving the Th\u00e9nardiers' inn). Marius lives there as well, next door to the Th\u00e9nardiers.\n\n\u00c9ponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his apartment to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing \"The Cops Are Here\" on a sheet of paper. Marius pities her and gives her some money. After \u00c9ponine leaves, Marius observes the \"Jondrettes\" in their apartment through a crack in the wall. \u00c9ponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look poorer, Th\u00e9nardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair. He also orders Azelma to punch out a window pane, which she does, resulting in cutting her hand (as Th\u00e9nardier had hoped).\n\nThe philanthropist and his daughter enter\u2014actually Valjean and Cosette. Marius immediately recognizes Cosette. After seeing them, Valjean promises them he will return with rent money for them. After he and Cosette leave, Marius asks \u00c9ponine to retrieve her address for him. \u00c9ponine, who is in love with Marius herself, reluctantly agrees to do so. The Th\u00e9nardiers have also recognized Valjean and Cosette, and vow their revenge. Th\u00e9nardier enlists the aid of the [[Patron-Minette]], a well-known and feared gang of murderers and robbers.\n\nMarius overhears Th\u00e9nardier's plan and goes to Javert to report the crime. Javert gives Marius two pistols and instructs him to fire one into the air if things get dangerous. Marius returns home and waits for Javert and the police to arrive. Th\u00e9nardier sends \u00c9ponine and Azelma outside to look out for the police. When Valjean returns with rent money, Th\u00e9nardier, with Patron-Minette, ambushes him and he reveals his real identity to Valjean. Marius recognizes Th\u00e9nardier as the man who saved his father's life at Waterloo and is caught in a dilemma.\n\nHe tries to find a way to save Valjean while not betraying Th\u00e9nardier. Valjean denies knowing Th\u00e9nardier and tells him that they have never met. Valjean tries to escape through a window but is subdued and tied up. Th\u00e9nardier orders Valjean to pay him 200,000 francs. He also orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette to return to the apartment, and they would keep her with them until he delivers the money. After Valjean writes the letter and informs Th\u00e9nardier of his address, Th\u00e9nardier sends out Mme. Th\u00e9nardier to get Cosette. Mme. Th\u00e9nardier comes back alone, and announces the address is a fake.\n\nIt is during this time that Valjean manages to free himself. Th\u00e9nardier decides to kill Valjean. While he and Patron-Minette are about to do so, Marius remembers the scrap of paper that \u00c9ponine wrote on earlier. He throws it into the Th\u00e9nardiers' apartment through the wall crack. Th\u00e9nardier reads it and thinks \u00c9ponine threw it inside. He, Mme. Th\u00e9nardier and Patron-Minette try to escape, only to be stopped by Javert.\n\nHe arrests all the Th\u00e9nardiers and Patron-Minette (except [[Patron-Minette|Claquesous]], who escapes during his transportation to prison, and [[Patron-Minette|Montparnasse]], who stops to run off with \u00c9ponine instead of joining in on the robbery). Valjean manages to escape the scene before Javert sees him.\n\n===Volume IV: The Idyll in the Rue Plumet and the Epic in the Rue St. Denis===\n[[File:Eponine and Patron-Minette.jpg|thumb|\u00c9ponine prevents the robbery at Valjean's house]]\nAfter \u00c9ponine's release from prison, she finds Marius at \"The Field of the Lark\" and sadly tells him that she found Cosette's address. She leads him to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, and Marius watches the house for a few days. He and Cosette then finally meet and declare their love for one another. Th\u00e9nardier, Patron-Minette and [[Champmathieu|Brujon]] manage to escape from prison with the aid of Gavroche (a rare case of Gavroche helping his family in their criminal activities). One night, during one of Marius's visits with Cosette, the six men attempt to raid Valjean's and Cosette's house. However, \u00c9ponine, who has been sitting by the gates of the house, threatens to scream and awaken the whole neighbourhood if the thieves do not leave. Hearing this, they reluctantly retire. Meanwhile, Cosette informs Marius that she and Valjean will be leaving for England in a week's time, which greatly troubles the pair.\n\nThe next day, Valjean is sitting in the [[Champ de Mars]]. He is feeling troubled about seeing Th\u00e9nardier in the neighbourhood several times. Unexpectedly, a note lands in his lap, which says \"Move Out.\" He sees a figure running away in the dim light. He goes back to his house, tells Cosette they will be staying at their other house on Rue de l'Homme Arme, and reconfirms to her that they will be moving to England. Marius tries to get permission from M. Gillenormand to marry Cosette. His grandfather seems stern and angry, but has been longing for Marius's return. When tempers flare, he refuses his assent to the marriage, telling Marius to make Cosette his mistress instead. Insulted, Marius leaves.\n\nThe following day, the students revolt and erect barricades in the narrow streets of Paris. Gavroche spots Javert and informs Enjolras that Javert is a spy. When Enjolras confronts him about this, he admits his identity and his orders to spy on the students. Enjolras and the other students tie him up to a pole in the Corinth restaurant. Later that evening, Marius goes back to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, but finds the house no longer occupied. He then hears a voice telling him that his friends are waiting for him at the barricade. Distraught to find Cosette gone, he heeds the voice and goes.\n\nWhen Marius arrives at the barricade, the revolution has already started. When he stoops down to pick up a powder keg, a soldier comes up to shoot Marius. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier's gun with his hand. The soldier fires, fatally wounding the man, while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top of the barricade, holding a torch in one hand, a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will blow up the barricade. After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from the barricade.\n\nMarius decides to go to the smaller barricade, which he finds empty. As he turns back, the man who took the fatal shot for Marius earlier calls Marius by his name. Marius discovers this man is \u00c9ponine, dressed in men's clothes. As she lies dying on his knees, she confesses that she was the one who told him to go to the barricade, hoping they would die together. She also confesses to saving his life because she wanted to die before he did.\n\nThe author also states to the reader that \u00c9ponine anonymously threw the note to Valjean. \u00c9ponine then tells Marius that she has a letter for him. She also confesses to have obtained the letter the day before, originally not planning to give it to him, but decides to do so in fear he would be angry at her about it in the afterlife. After Marius takes the letter, \u00c9ponine then asks him to kiss her on the forehead when she is dead, which he promises to do. With her last breath, she confesses that she was \"a little bit in love\" with him, and dies.\n\nMarius fulfills her request and goes into a tavern to read the letter. It is written by Cosette. He learns Cosette's whereabouts and he writes a farewell letter to her. He sends Gavroche to deliver it to her, but Gavroche leaves it with Valjean. Valjean, learning that Cosette's lover is fighting, is at first relieved, but an hour later, he puts on a National Guard uniform, arms himself with a gun and ammunition, and leaves his home.\n\n===Volume V: Jean Valjean===\n[[File:Lesmiserables 1900 valjean rescues Marius.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Valjean in the sewers with the wounded Marius (US edition, 1900)]]\nValjean arrives at the barricade and immediately saves a man's life. He is still not certain if he wants to protect Marius or kill him. Marius recognizes Valjean at first sight. Enjolras announces that they are almost out of cartridges. When Gavroche goes outside the barricade to collect more ammunition from the dead National Guardsmen, he is shot dead.\n\nValjean volunteers to execute Javert himself, and Enjolras grants permission. Valjean takes Javert out of sight, and then shoots into the air while letting him go. Marius mistakenly believes that Valjean has killed Javert. As the barricade falls, Valjean carries off the injured and unconscious Marius. All the other students are killed. Valjean escapes through the sewers, carrying Marius's body. He evades a police patrol, and reaches an exit gate but finds it locked. Th\u00e9nardier emerges from the darkness. Valjean recognizes Th\u00e9nardier, but Th\u00e9nardier does not recognize Valjean. Thinking Valjean a murderer lugging his victim's corpse, Th\u00e9nardier offers to open the gate for money. As he searches Valjean and Marius's pockets, he surreptitiously tears off a piece of Marius's coat so he can later find out his identity. Th\u00e9nardier takes the thirty francs he finds, opens the gate, and allows Valjean to leave, expecting Valjean's emergence from the sewer will distract the police who have been pursuing him.\n\nUpon exiting, Valjean encounters Javert and requests time to return Marius to his family before surrendering to him. Surprisingly Javert agrees, assuming that Marius will be dead within minutes. After leaving Marius at his grandfather's house, Valjean asks to be allowed a brief visit to his own home, and Javert agrees. There, Javert tells Valjean he will wait for him in the street, but when Valjean scans the street from the landing window he finds Javert has gone. Javert walks down the street, realizing that he is caught between his strict belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown him. He feels he can no longer give Valjean up to the authorities but also cannot ignore his duty to the law. Unable to cope with this dilemma, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into the [[Seine]].\n\nMarius slowly recovers from his injuries. As he and Cosette make wedding preparations, Valjean endows them with a fortune of nearly 600,000 francs. As their wedding party winds through Paris during [[Mardi Gras]] festivities, Valjean is spotted by Th\u00e9nardier, who then orders Azelma to follow him. After the wedding, Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius is horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean's moral character, and contrives to limit Valjean's time with Cosette. Valjean accedes to Marius' judgment and his separation from Cosette. Valjean loses the will to live and retires to his bed.\n\nTh\u00e9nardier approaches Marius in disguise, but Marius recognizes him. Th\u00e9nardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what he knows of Valjean, but in doing so, he inadvertently corrects Marius's misconceptions about Valjean and reveals all of the good he has done. He tries to convince Marius that Valjean is actually a murderer, and presents the piece of coat he tore off as evidence. Stunned, Marius recognizes the fabric as part of his own coat and realizes that it was Valjean who rescued him from the barricade. Marius pulls out a fistful of notes and flings it at Th\u00e9nardier's face. He then confronts Th\u00e9nardier with his crimes and offers him an immense sum to depart and never return. Th\u00e9nardier accepts the offer, and he and Azelma travel to America where he becomes a slave trader.\n\nAs they rush to Valjean's house, Marius tells Cosette that Valjean saved his life at the barricade. They arrive to find Valjean near death and reconcile with him. Valjean tells Cosette her mother's story and name. He dies content and is buried beneath a blank slab in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Les Mis\u00e9rables characters}}\n\n===Major===\n* '''[[Jean Valjean]]''' (also known as Monsieur Madeleine, Ultime Fauchelevent, Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre) \u2013 The protagonist of the novel. Convicted for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's seven starving children and sent to prison for five years, he is paroled from prison nineteen years later (after four unsuccessful escape attempts added twelve years and fighting back during the second escape attempt added two extra years). Rejected by society for being a former convict, he encounters Bishop Myriel, who turns his life around by showing him mercy and encouraging him to become a new man. While sitting and pondering what Bishop Myriel had said, he puts his shoe on a forty-sou piece dropped by a young wanderer. Valjean threatens the boy with his stick when the boy attempts to rouse Valjean from his reverie and recover his money. He tells a passing priest his name, and the name of the boy, and this allows the police to charge him with armed robbery \u2013 a sentence that, if he were caught again, would return him to prison for life. He assumes a new identity (Monsieur Madeleine) in order to pursue an honest life. He introduces new manufacturing techniques and eventually builds two factories and becomes one of the richest men in the area. By popular acclaim, he is made mayor. He confronts Javert over Fantine's punishment, turns himself in to the police to save another man from prison for life, and rescues Cosette from the Th\u00e9nardiers. Discovered by Javert in Paris because of his generosity to the poor, he evades capture for the next several years in a convent. He saves Marius from imprisonment and probable death at the barricade, reveals his true identity to Marius and Cosette after their wedding, and is reunited with them just before his death, having kept his promise to the bishop and to Fantine, the image of whom is the last thing he sees before dying.\n* '''[[Javert]]''' \u2013 A fanatic police inspector in pursuit to recapture Valjean. Born in the prisons to a convict father and a fortune teller mother, he renounces both of them and starts working as a guard in the prison, including one stint as the overseer for the chain gang of which Valjean is part (and here witnesses firsthand Valjean's enormous strength and just what he looks like). Eventually he joins the police force in Montreuil-sur-Mer. He arrests Fantine and comes into conflict with Valjean/Madeleine, who orders him to release Fantine. Valjean dismisses Javert in front of his squad and Javert, seeking revenge, reports to the Police Inspector that he has discovered Jean Valjean. He is told that he must be incorrect, as a man mistakenly believed to be Jean Valjean was just arrested. He requests of M. Madeline that he be dismissed in disgrace, for he cannot be less harsh on himself than on others. When the real Jean Valjean turns himself in, Javert is promoted to the Paris police force where he arrests Valjean and sends him back to prison. After Valjean escapes again, Javert attempts one more arrest in vain. He then almost recaptures Valjean at Gorbeau house when he arrests the Th\u00e9nardiers and [[Patron-Minette]]. Later, while working undercover behind the barricade, his identity is discovered. Valjean pretends to execute Javert, but releases him. When Javert next encounters Valjean emerging from the sewers, he allows him to make a brief visit home and then walks off instead of arresting him. Javert cannot reconcile his devotion to the law with his recognition that the lawful course is immoral. After composing a letter to the prefect of police outlining the squalid conditions that occur in prisons and the abuses that prisoners are subjected to, he takes his own life by jumping into the [[River Seine|Seine]].\n* '''[[Fantine]]''' \u2013 A beautiful Parisian [[Grisette (French)|grisette]] abandoned with a small child by her lover F\u00e9lix Tholomy\u00e8s. Fantine leaves her daughter Cosette in the care of the Th\u00e9nardiers, innkeepers in the village of [[Montfermeil]]. Mme. Th\u00e9nardier spoils her own daughters and abuses Cosette. Fantine finds work at Monsieur Madeleine's factory. Illiterate, she has others write letters to the Th\u00e9nardiers on her behalf. A female supervisor discovers that she is an unwed mother and dismisses her. To meet the Th\u00e9nardiers' repeated demands for money, she sells her hair and two front teeth, and turns to prostitution. She becomes ill. Valjean learns of her plight when Javert arrests her for attacking a man who called her insulting names and threw snow down her back, and sends her to a hospital. As Javert confronts Valjean in her hospital room, because her illness has made her so weak, she dies of shock after Javert reveals that Valjean is a convict and hasn't brought her daughter Cosette to her (after the doctor encouraged that incorrect belief that Jean Valjean's recent absence was because he was bringing her daughter to her).\n* '''[[Cosette]]''' (formally Euphrasie, also known as \"the Lark\", Mademoiselle Lanoire, Ursula) \u2013 The [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] daughter of Fantine and Tholomy\u00e8s.

After her mother Fantine dies, Valjean ransoms Cosette from the Th\u00e9nardiers and cares for her as if she were his daughter. Nuns in a Paris convent educate her.

She falls in love with Marius Pontmercy and marries him near the novel's conclusion.\n* '''[[Marius Pontmercy]]''' \u2013 A young law student loosely associated with the Friends of the ABC.

As a child, she is pampered and spoiled by her parents, but ends up a street urchin when she reaches adolescence. She participates in her father's crimes and begging schemes to obtain money. She is blindly in love with Marius. At Marius' request, she finds Valjean and Cosette's house for him and sadly leads him there. She also prevents her father, Patron-Minette, and [[Champmathieu|Brujon]] from robbing the house during one of Marius' visits there to see Cosette. After disguising herself as a boy, she manipulates Marius into going to the barricades, hoping that she and Marius will die there together. Wanting to die before Marius, she reaches out her hand to stop a soldier from shooting at him; she is mortally wounded as the bullet goes through her hand and her back. As she is dying, she confesses all this to Marius, and gives him a letter from Cosette. Her final request to Marius is that once she has passed, he will kiss her on the forehead. He fulfills her request not because of romantic feelings on his part, but out of pity for her hard life.\n* '''[[Th\u00e9nardiers|Monsieur Th\u00e9nardier and Madame Th\u00e9nardier]]''' (also known as the Jondrettes, M.

They become bankrupt and relocate under the name Jondrette to a house in Paris called the Gorbeau house, living in the room next to Marius. The husband associates with a criminal group called \"the [[Patron-Minette]]\", and conspires to rob Valjean until he is thwarted by Marius. Javert arrests the couple. The wife dies in prison.

The narrator occasionally injects himself into the narrative or reports facts outside the time of the narrative to emphasize that he is recounting historical events, not entirely fiction. He introduces his recounting of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] with several paragraphs describing the narrator's recent approach to the battlefield: \"Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person who is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles&nbsp;...\"<ref>Victor Brombert, \"''Les Mis\u00e9rables'': Salvation from Below\", in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Victor Hugo: Modern Critical Views'' (NY: Chelsea House, 1988), 198\u201399; Vol. 2, Book 1, Chapter 1</ref> The narrator describes how \"[a]n observer, a dreamer, the author of this book\" during the 1832 street fighting was caught in crossfire: \"All that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half columns which separate the shops; he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour.\" At one point he apologizes for intruding\u2014\"The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself\"\u2014to ask the reader's understanding when he describes \"the Paris of his youth&nbsp;... as though it still existed.\" This introduces a meditation on memories of past places that his contemporary readers would recognize as a self-portrait written from exile: \"you have left a part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements.\" He describes another occasion when a bullet shot \"pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended&nbsp;... over a hairdresser's shop. This pierced shaving-dish was still to be seen in 1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the pillars of the market.\" As evidence of police double agents at the barricades, he writes: \"The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the special report on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.\"\n\n==Contemporary reception==\nThe appearance of the novel was a highly anticipated event as Victor Hugo was considered one of France's foremost poets in the middle of the nineteenth century. The ''[[New York Times]]'' announced its forthcoming publication as early as April 1860.<ref>{{cite news|title=Personalities.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/10/news/personalities.html|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 April 1860}}</ref> Hugo forbade his publishers from summarizing his story and refused to authorize the publication of excerpts in advance of publication. He instructed them to build on his earlier success and suggested this approach: \"What Victor H. did for the Gothic world in ''Notre-Dame of Paris'' [''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''], he accomplishes for the modern world in ''Les Miserables''\".<ref>Behr, ''Compete Book'', 38</ref> A massive advertising campaign<ref>La r\u00e9ception des Mis\u00e9rables en 1862 \u2013 Max Bach \u2013 PMLA, Vol. 77, No. 5 (December 1962)</ref> preceded the release of the first two volumes of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in Brussels on 30 or 31 March and in Paris on 3 April 1862.<ref>{{cite web|title=les miserables, victor hugo, First Edition, 1862|url=http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/les-miserables/author/victor-hugo/first-edition/price-min/2100/pub-min/1862/pub-max/1862/sortby/1/page-1/|publisher=ABE Books|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref> The remaining volumes appeared on 15 May 1862.\n\nCritical reactions were wide-ranging and often negative. Some critics found the subject matter immoral, others complained of its excessive sentimentality, and others were disquieted by its apparent sympathy with the revolutionaries. L. Gauthier wrote in ''Le Monde'' of 17 August 1862: \"One cannot read without an unconquerable disgust all the details Monsieur Hugo gives regarding the successful planning of riots.\"<ref>[http://groupugo.div.jussieu.fr/groupugo/doc/97-03-22Bouchet.pdf PDF]</ref> The [[Goncourt brothers]] judged the novel artificial and disappointing.<ref>Goncourt, Edmond et Jules, Journal, Vol. I, Laffont, 1989, {{ISBN|2-221-05527-6}}, April 1862, pp. 808\u201309</ref> [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] found \"neither truth nor greatness\" in it. He complained that the characters were crude stereotypes who all \"speak very well \u2013 but all in the same way\".

However, several alternatives have been used, including ''The Miserables'', ''The Wretched'', ''The Miserable Ones'', ''The Poor Ones'', ''The Wretched Poor'', ''The Victims'' and ''The Dispossessed''.<ref>Novelist Susanne Alleyn has argued that \"the phrase \u201cles mis\u00e9rables\u201d, which has a whole range of subtly shaded meanings in French, is much better translated into English as \u201cthe dispossessed\u201d or even as \u201cthe outsiders\u201d, which can describe every major character in the novel in one way or another, than simply as \u201cthe miserable ones\u201d / \u201cthe wretched ones.\u201d [http://hfebooks.com/no-its-not-actually-the-french-revolution-les-miserables-and-history-by-susanne-alleyn/ No, It\u2019s Not Actually the French Revolution: Les Mis\u00e9rables and History.]</ref> Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 [[June Rebellion]] in [[Paris]], the novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict [[Jean Valjean]] and his experience of redemption.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11437196|title=BBC News \u2013 Bon anniversaire! 25 facts about Les Mis|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=1 October 2010|date=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nExamining the nature of law and grace, the novel elaborates upon the [[history of France]], the architecture and urban design of Paris, politics, [[moral philosophy]], [[antimonarchism]], justice, religion, and the types and nature of [[romantic love|romantic]] and familial love. ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' has been popularized through numerous [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables|adaptations]] for film, television and the stage, including a musical.\n\n== Novel form ==\n[[Upton Sinclair]] described the novel as \"one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world\", and remarked that Hugo set forth the purpose of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in the ''Preface'':<ref>{{cite book|last=Sinclair|first=Upton|title=The Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest|year=1915|publisher=charlesrivereditors.com Charles Rivers Editors|isbn=978-1-247-96345-7|url=http://www.bartleby.com/71/0405.html}}</ref> {{Quote|text=So long as there shall exist, by reason of law and custom, a social condemnation, which, in the face of civilization, artificially creates hells on earth, and complicates a destiny that is divine with human fatality; so long as the three problems of the age\u2014the degradation of man by poverty, the ruin of women by starvation, and the dwarfing of childhood by physical and spiritual night\u2014are not solved; so long as, in certain regions, social asphyxia shall be possible; in other words, and from a yet more extended point of view, so long as ignorance and misery remain on earth, books like this cannot be useless.}}\n\nTowards the end of the novel, Hugo explains the work's overarching structure:<ref>Alexander Welsh, \"Opening and Closing ''Les Mis\u00e9rables''\", in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Victor Hugo: Modern Critical Views'' (NY: Chelsea House, 1988), 155; Vol. 5, Book 1, Chapter 20</ref>\n{{quote|The book which the reader has before him at this moment is, from one end to the other, in its entirety and details&nbsp;... a progress from evil to good, from injustice to justice, from falsehood to truth, from night to day, from appetite to conscience, from corruption to life; from bestiality to duty, from hell to heaven, from nothingness to God. The starting point: matter, destination: the soul. The [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]] at the beginning, the angel at the end.}}\n\nThe novel contains various subplots, but the main thread is the story of ex-convict [[Jean Valjean]], who becomes a force for good in the world but cannot escape his criminal past. The novel is divided into five volumes, each volume divided into several books, and subdivided into chapters, for a total of 48 books and 365 chapters. Each chapter is relatively short, commonly no longer than a few pages.\n\nThe novel as a whole is one of the [[List of longest novels|longest ever written]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/22F3SA74XBA5Y |title=Read the Ten Longest Novels Ever Written |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref> with 655,478 words in the original French. Hugo explained his ambitions for the novel to his Italian publisher:<ref>Behr, ''Complete Book'', 39\u201342</ref>\n{{quote|I don't know whether it will be read by everyone, but it is meant for everyone. It addresses England as well as Spain, Italy as well as France, Germany as well as Ireland, the republics that harbour slaves as well as empires that have serfs. Social problems go beyond frontiers. Humankind's wounds, those huge sores that litter the world, do not stop at the blue and red lines drawn on maps. Wherever men go in ignorance or despair, wherever women sell themselves for bread, wherever children lack a book to learn from or a warm hearth, ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' knocks at the door and says: \"open up, I am here for you\".}}\n\n=== Digressions ===\nMore than a quarter of the novel\u2014by one count 955 of 2,783 pages\u2014is devoted to essays that argue a moral point or display Hugo's encyclopedic knowledge but do not advance the plot, nor even a subplot, a method Hugo used in such other works as ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' and ''[[Toilers of the Sea]]''. One biographer noted that \"the digressions of genius are easily pardoned\".<ref>A. F. Davidson, ''Victor Hugo: His Life And Work'' (J. B. Lippincott, 1929), Kindle Location 4026, 4189</ref> The topics Hugo addresses include cloistered [[religious order]]s, the construction of the [[Paris sewers]], [[argot]], and the [[street urchin]]s of Paris. The one about convents he titles \"Parenthesis\" to alert the reader to its irrelevance to the story line.<ref>Victor Brombert, \"''Les Mis\u00e9rables'': Salvation from Below\", in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Modern Critical Views: Victor Hugo'' (Chelsea House, 1988), 195</ref>\n\nHugo devotes another 19 chapters (Volume II, Book I) to an account of\u2014and a meditation on the place in history of\u2014the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the battlefield which Hugo visited in 1861 and where he finished writing the novel. It opens volume 2 with such a change of subject as to seem the beginning of an entirely different work. The fact that this 'digression' occupies such a large part of the text demands that it be read in the context of the 'overarching structure' discussed above. Hugo draws his own personal conclusions, taking Waterloo to be a pivot-point in history, but definitely not a victory for the forces of reaction.\n\n{{quote|Waterloo, by cutting short the demolition of European thrones by the sword, had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued in another direction.

The novel opens with a statement about the bishop of Digne in 1815 and immediately shifts: \"Although these details in no way essentially concern that which we have to tell...\" Only after 14 chapters does Hugo pick up the opening thread again, \"In the early days of the month of October, 1815...\", to introduce Jean Valjean.<ref>Alexander Welsh, \"Opening and Closing ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'',\" in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Modern Critical Views: Victor Hugo'' (Chelsea House, 1988), 151\u201352</ref>\n\n==Hugo's sources==\n[[File:Achille Dev\u00e9ria - Vidocq.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eug\u00e8ne Vidocq]], whose career provided a model for the character of Jean Valjean]]\nAn incident Hugo witnessed in 1829 involved three strangers and a police officer.

He sleeps on the street, angry and bitter.\n\nDigne's benevolent [[Bishop Myriel]] gives him shelter. At night, Valjean runs off with Myriel's silverware. When the police capture Valjean, Myriel pretends that he has given the silverware to Valjean and presses him to take two silver candlesticks as well, as if he had forgotten to take them. The police accept his explanation and leave. Myriel tells Valjean that his life has been spared for God, and that he should use money from the silver candlesticks to make an honest man of himself.\n\nValjean broods over Myriel's words. When opportunity presents itself, purely out of habit, he steals a 40-[[Sou (coin)|sous]] coin from 12-year-old Petit Gervais and chases the boy away. He quickly repents and searches the city in panic for Gervais. At the same time, his theft is reported to the authorities. Valjean hides as they search for him, because if apprehended he will be returned to the galleys for life as a repeat offender.\n\nSix years pass and Valjean, using the alias Monsieur Madeleine, has become a wealthy factory owner and is appointed mayor of [[Montreuil-sur-Mer]]. Walking down the street, he sees a man named Fauchelevent pinned under the wheels of a cart. When no one volunteers to lift the cart, even for pay, he decides to rescue Fauchelevent himself. He crawls underneath the cart, manages to lift it, and frees him. The town's police inspector, Inspector [[Javert]], who was an adjutant guard at the Bagne of Toulon during Valjean's incarceration, becomes suspicious of the mayor after witnessing this remarkable feat of strength. He has known only one other man, a convict named Jean Valjean, who could accomplish it.\n\nYears earlier in Paris, a [[Grisette (person)|grisette]] named [[Fantine]] was very much in love with F\u00e9lix Tholomy\u00e8s. His friends, Listolier, Fameuil, and Blachevelle were also paired with Fantine's friends Dahlia, Z\u00e9phine, and Favourite. The men abandon the women, treating their relationships as youthful amusements. Fantine must draw on her own resources to care for her and Tholomy\u00e8s' daughter, [[Cosette]]. When Fantine arrives at [[Montfermeil]], she leaves Cosette in the care of the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], a corrupt innkeeper and his selfish, cruel wife.\n\nFantine is unaware that they are abusing her daughter and using her as forced labor for their inn, and continues to try to meet their growing, extortionate and fictitious demands. She is later fired from her job at Jean Valjean's factory, because of the discovery of her daughter, who was born out of wedlock. Meanwhile, the Th\u00e9nardiers' monetary demands continue to grow. In desperation, Fantine sells her hair and two front teeth, and she resorts to prostitution to pay the Th\u00e9nardiers. Fantine is slowly dying from an unspecified disease.\n\nA [[dandy]] named Bamatabois harasses Fantine in the street, and she reacts by striking him. Javert arrests Fantine. She begs to be released so that she can provide for her daughter, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean (Mayor Madeleine) intervenes and orders Javert to release her. Javert resists but Valjean prevails. Valjean, feeling responsible because his factory turned her away, promises Fantine that he will bring Cosette to her. He takes her to a hospital.\n\nJavert comes to see Valjean again. Javert admits that after being forced to free Fantine, he reported him as Valjean to the French authorities. He tells Valjean he realizes he was wrong, because the authorities have identified someone else as the real Jean Valjean, have him in custody, and plan to try him the next day. Valjean is torn, but decides to reveal himself to save the innocent man, whose real name is Champmathieu. He travels to attend the trial and there reveals his true identity. Valjean returns to Montreuil to see Fantine, followed by Javert, who confronts him in her hospital room.\n\nAfter Javert grabs Valjean, Valjean asks for three days to bring Cosette to Fantine, but Javert refuses. Fantine discovers that Cosette is not at the hospital and fretfully asks where she is. Javert orders her to be quiet, and then reveals to her Valjean's real identity. Weakened by the severity of her illness, she falls back in shock and dies. Valjean goes to Fantine, speaks to her in an inaudible whisper, kisses her hand, and then leaves with Javert. Later, Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public [[Graveyard|grave]].\n\n===Volume II: Cosette===\n[[File:Ebcosette.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of \"[[Cosette]]\" by [[Emile Bayard]], from the original edition of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' (1862)]]\nValjean escapes, is recaptured, and is sentenced to death. The king commutes his sentence to penal servitude for life. While imprisoned in the [[Bagne of Toulon]], Valjean, at great personal risk, rescues a sailor caught in the ship's rigging. Spectators call for his release. Valjean fakes his own death by allowing himself to fall into the ocean. Authorities report him dead and his body lost.\n\nValjean arrives at Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette fetching water in the woods alone and walks with her to the inn. He orders a meal and observes how the Th\u00e9nardiers abuse her, while pampering their own daughters [[\u00c9ponine]] and Azelma, who mistreat Cosette for playing with their doll. Valjean leaves and returns to make Cosette a present of an expensive new doll which, after some hesitation, she happily accepts. \u00c9ponine and Azelma are envious. Madame Th\u00e9nardier is furious with Valjean, while her husband makes light of Valjean's behaviour, caring only that he pay for his food and lodging.\n\nThe next morning, Valjean informs the Th\u00e9nardiers that he wants to take Cosette with him. Madame Th\u00e9nardier immediately accepts, while Th\u00e9nardier pretends to love Cosette and be concerned for her welfare, reluctant to give her up. Valjean pays the Th\u00e9nardiers 1,500 francs, and he and Cosette leave the inn. Th\u00e9nardier, hoping to swindle more out of Valjean, runs after them, holding the 1,500 francs, and tells Valjean he wants Cosette back. He informs Valjean that he cannot release Cosette without a note from the child's mother. Valjean hands Th\u00e9nardier Fantine's letter authorizing the bearer to take Cosette. Th\u00e9nardier then demands that Valjean pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean and Cosette leave. Th\u00e9nardier regrets that he did not bring his gun and turns back toward home.\n\nValjean and Cosette flee to Paris. Valjean rents new lodgings at Gorbeau House, where he and Cosette live happily. However, Javert discovers Valjean's lodgings there a few months later. Valjean takes Cosette and they try to escape from Javert. They soon find shelter in the Petit-Picpus convent with the help of Fauchelevent, the man whom Valjean once rescued from being crushed under a cart and who has become the convent's gardener. Valjean also becomes a gardener and Cosette becomes a student at the convent school.\n\n===Volume III: Marius===\nEight years later, the [[Friends of the ABC]], led by [[Enjolras]], are preparing an act of anti-[[Orl\u00e9anist]] civil unrest (i.e. the [[June Rebellion|Paris uprising on 5\u20136 June 1832]], following the death of [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only French leader who had sympathy towards the working class. Lamarque was a victim of a major cholera epidemic that had ravaged the city, particularly its poor neighborhoods, arousing suspicion that the government had been poisoning wells). The Friends of the ABC are joined by the poor of the ''[[Cour des miracles]]'', including the Th\u00e9nardiers' eldest son [[Gavroche]], who is a [[street urchin]].\n\nOne of the students, [[Marius Pontmercy]], has become alienated from his family (especially his [[Royalism|royalist]] grandfather M. Gillenormand) because of his [[Bonapartism]] views. After the death of his father, Colonel Georges Pontmercy, Marius discovers a note from him instructing his son to provide help to a sergeant named Th\u00e9nardier who saved his life at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]\u2014in reality Th\u00e9nardier was looting corpses and only saved Pontmercy's life by accident; he had called himself a sergeant under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] to avoid exposing himself as a robber.\n\nAt the [[Luxembourg Garden]], Marius falls in love with the now grown and beautiful Cosette. The Th\u00e9nardiers have also moved to Paris and now live in poverty after losing their inn. They live under the surname \"Jondrette\" at Gorbeau House (coincidentally, the same building Valjean and Cosette briefly lived in after leaving the Th\u00e9nardiers' inn). Marius lives there as well, next door to the Th\u00e9nardiers.\n\n\u00c9ponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his apartment to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing \"The Cops Are Here\" on a sheet of paper. Marius pities her and gives her some money. After \u00c9ponine leaves, Marius observes the \"Jondrettes\" in their apartment through a crack in the wall. \u00c9ponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look poorer, Th\u00e9nardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair. He also orders Azelma to punch out a window pane, which she does, resulting in cutting her hand (as Th\u00e9nardier had hoped).\n\nThe philanthropist and his daughter enter\u2014actually Valjean and Cosette. Marius immediately recognizes Cosette. After seeing them, Valjean promises them he will return with rent money for them. After he and Cosette leave, Marius asks \u00c9ponine to retrieve her address for him. \u00c9ponine, who is in love with Marius herself, reluctantly agrees to do so. The Th\u00e9nardiers have also recognized Valjean and Cosette, and vow their revenge. Th\u00e9nardier enlists the aid of the [[Patron-Minette]], a well-known and feared gang of murderers and robbers.\n\nMarius overhears Th\u00e9nardier's plan and goes to Javert to report the crime. Javert gives Marius two pistols and instructs him to fire one into the air if things get dangerous. Marius returns home and waits for Javert and the police to arrive. Th\u00e9nardier sends \u00c9ponine and Azelma outside to look out for the police. When Valjean returns with rent money, Th\u00e9nardier, with Patron-Minette, ambushes him and he reveals his real identity to Valjean. Marius recognizes Th\u00e9nardier as the man who saved his father's life at Waterloo and is caught in a dilemma.\n\nHe tries to find a way to save Valjean while not betraying Th\u00e9nardier. Valjean denies knowing Th\u00e9nardier and tells him that they have never met. Valjean tries to escape through a window but is subdued and tied up. Th\u00e9nardier orders Valjean to pay him 200,000 francs. He also orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette to return to the apartment, and they would keep her with them until he delivers the money. After Valjean writes the letter and informs Th\u00e9nardier of his address, Th\u00e9nardier sends out Mme. Th\u00e9nardier to get Cosette. Mme. Th\u00e9nardier comes back alone, and announces the address is a fake.\n\nIt is during this time that Valjean manages to free himself. Th\u00e9nardier decides to kill Valjean. While he and Patron-Minette are about to do so, Marius remembers the scrap of paper that \u00c9ponine wrote on earlier. He throws it into the Th\u00e9nardiers' apartment through the wall crack. Th\u00e9nardier reads it and thinks \u00c9ponine threw it inside. He, Mme. Th\u00e9nardier and Patron-Minette try to escape, only to be stopped by Javert.\n\nHe arrests all the Th\u00e9nardiers and Patron-Minette (except [[Patron-Minette|Claquesous]], who escapes during his transportation to prison, and [[Patron-Minette|Montparnasse]], who stops to run off with \u00c9ponine instead of joining in on the robbery). Valjean manages to escape the scene before Javert sees him.\n\n===Volume IV: The Idyll in the Rue Plumet and the Epic in the Rue St. Denis===\n[[File:Eponine and Patron-Minette.jpg|thumb|\u00c9ponine prevents the robbery at Valjean's house]]\nAfter \u00c9ponine's release from prison, she finds Marius at \"The Field of the Lark\" and sadly tells him that she found Cosette's address. She leads him to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, and Marius watches the house for a few days. He and Cosette then finally meet and declare their love for one another. Th\u00e9nardier, Patron-Minette and [[Champmathieu|Brujon]] manage to escape from prison with the aid of Gavroche (a rare case of Gavroche helping his family in their criminal activities). One night, during one of Marius's visits with Cosette, the six men attempt to raid Valjean's and Cosette's house. However, \u00c9ponine, who has been sitting by the gates of the house, threatens to scream and awaken the whole neighbourhood if the thieves do not leave. Hearing this, they reluctantly retire. Meanwhile, Cosette informs Marius that she and Valjean will be leaving for England in a week's time, which greatly troubles the pair.\n\nThe next day, Valjean is sitting in the [[Champ de Mars]]. He is feeling troubled about seeing Th\u00e9nardier in the neighbourhood several times. Unexpectedly, a note lands in his lap, which says \"Move Out.\" He sees a figure running away in the dim light. He goes back to his house, tells Cosette they will be staying at their other house on Rue de l'Homme Arme, and reconfirms to her that they will be moving to England. Marius tries to get permission from M. Gillenormand to marry Cosette. His grandfather seems stern and angry, but has been longing for Marius's return. When tempers flare, he refuses his assent to the marriage, telling Marius to make Cosette his mistress instead. Insulted, Marius leaves.\n\nThe following day, the students revolt and erect barricades in the narrow streets of Paris. Gavroche spots Javert and informs Enjolras that Javert is a spy. When Enjolras confronts him about this, he admits his identity and his orders to spy on the students. Enjolras and the other students tie him up to a pole in the Corinth restaurant. Later that evening, Marius goes back to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, but finds the house no longer occupied. He then hears a voice telling him that his friends are waiting for him at the barricade. Distraught to find Cosette gone, he heeds the voice and goes.\n\nWhen Marius arrives at the barricade, the revolution has already started. When he stoops down to pick up a powder keg, a soldier comes up to shoot Marius. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier's gun with his hand. The soldier fires, fatally wounding the man, while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top of the barricade, holding a torch in one hand, a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will blow up the barricade. After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from the barricade.\n\nMarius decides to go to the smaller barricade, which he finds empty. As he turns back, the man who took the fatal shot for Marius earlier calls Marius by his name. Marius discovers this man is \u00c9ponine, dressed in men's clothes. As she lies dying on his knees, she confesses that she was the one who told him to go to the barricade, hoping they would die together. She also confesses to saving his life because she wanted to die before he did.\n\nThe author also states to the reader that \u00c9ponine anonymously threw the note to Valjean. \u00c9ponine then tells Marius that she has a letter for him. She also confesses to have obtained the letter the day before, originally not planning to give it to him, but decides to do so in fear he would be angry at her about it in the afterlife. After Marius takes the letter, \u00c9ponine then asks him to kiss her on the forehead when she is dead, which he promises to do. With her last breath, she confesses that she was \"a little bit in love\" with him, and dies.\n\nMarius fulfills her request and goes into a tavern to read the letter. It is written by Cosette. He learns Cosette's whereabouts and he writes a farewell letter to her. He sends Gavroche to deliver it to her, but Gavroche leaves it with Valjean. Valjean, learning that Cosette's lover is fighting, is at first relieved, but an hour later, he puts on a National Guard uniform, arms himself with a gun and ammunition, and leaves his home.\n\n===Volume V: Jean Valjean===\n[[File:Lesmiserables 1900 valjean rescues Marius.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Valjean in the sewers with the wounded Marius (US edition, 1900)]]\nValjean arrives at the barricade and immediately saves a man's life. He is still not certain if he wants to protect Marius or kill him. Marius recognizes Valjean at first sight. Enjolras announces that they are almost out of cartridges. When Gavroche goes outside the barricade to collect more ammunition from the dead National Guardsmen, he is shot dead.\n\nValjean volunteers to execute Javert himself, and Enjolras grants permission. Valjean takes Javert out of sight, and then shoots into the air while letting him go. Marius mistakenly believes that Valjean has killed Javert. As the barricade falls, Valjean carries off the injured and unconscious Marius. All the other students are killed. Valjean escapes through the sewers, carrying Marius's body. He evades a police patrol, and reaches an exit gate but finds it locked. Th\u00e9nardier emerges from the darkness. Valjean recognizes Th\u00e9nardier, but Th\u00e9nardier does not recognize Valjean. Thinking Valjean a murderer lugging his victim's corpse, Th\u00e9nardier offers to open the gate for money. As he searches Valjean and Marius's pockets, he surreptitiously tears off a piece of Marius's coat so he can later find out his identity. Th\u00e9nardier takes the thirty francs he finds, opens the gate, and allows Valjean to leave, expecting Valjean's emergence from the sewer will distract the police who have been pursuing him.\n\nUpon exiting, Valjean encounters Javert and requests time to return Marius to his family before surrendering to him. Surprisingly Javert agrees, assuming that Marius will be dead within minutes. After leaving Marius at his grandfather's house, Valjean asks to be allowed a brief visit to his own home, and Javert agrees. There, Javert tells Valjean he will wait for him in the street, but when Valjean scans the street from the landing window he finds Javert has gone. Javert walks down the street, realizing that he is caught between his strict belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown him. He feels he can no longer give Valjean up to the authorities but also cannot ignore his duty to the law. Unable to cope with this dilemma, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into the [[Seine]].\n\nMarius slowly recovers from his injuries. As he and Cosette make wedding preparations, Valjean endows them with a fortune of nearly 600,000 francs. As their wedding party winds through Paris during [[Mardi Gras]] festivities, Valjean is spotted by Th\u00e9nardier, who then orders Azelma to follow him. After the wedding, Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius is horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean's moral character, and contrives to limit Valjean's time with Cosette. Valjean accedes to Marius' judgment and his separation from Cosette. Valjean loses the will to live and retires to his bed.\n\nTh\u00e9nardier approaches Marius in disguise, but Marius recognizes him. Th\u00e9nardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what he knows of Valjean, but in doing so, he inadvertently corrects Marius's misconceptions about Valjean and reveals all of the good he has done. He tries to convince Marius that Valjean is actually a murderer, and presents the piece of coat he tore off as evidence. Stunned, Marius recognizes the fabric as part of his own coat and realizes that it was Valjean who rescued him from the barricade. Marius pulls out a fistful of notes and flings it at Th\u00e9nardier's face. He then confronts Th\u00e9nardier with his crimes and offers him an immense sum to depart and never return. Th\u00e9nardier accepts the offer, and he and Azelma travel to America where he becomes a slave trader.\n\nAs they rush to Valjean's house, Marius tells Cosette that Valjean saved his life at the barricade. They arrive to find Valjean near death and reconcile with him. Valjean tells Cosette her mother's story and name. He dies content and is buried beneath a blank slab in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Les Mis\u00e9rables characters}}\n\n===Major===\n* '''[[Jean Valjean]]''' (also known as Monsieur Madeleine, Ultime Fauchelevent, Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre) \u2013 The protagonist of the novel. Convicted for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's seven starving children and sent to prison for five years, he is paroled from prison nineteen years later (after four unsuccessful escape attempts added twelve years and fighting back during the second escape attempt added two extra years). Rejected by society for being a former convict, he encounters Bishop Myriel, who turns his life around by showing him mercy and encouraging him to become a new man. While sitting and pondering what Bishop Myriel had said, he puts his shoe on a forty-sou piece dropped by a young wanderer. Valjean threatens the boy with his stick when the boy attempts to rouse Valjean from his reverie and recover his money. He tells a passing priest his name, and the name of the boy, and this allows the police to charge him with armed robbery \u2013 a sentence that, if he were caught again, would return him to prison for life. He assumes a new identity (Monsieur Madeleine) in order to pursue an honest life. He introduces new manufacturing techniques and eventually builds two factories and becomes one of the richest men in the area. By popular acclaim, he is made mayor. He confronts Javert over Fantine's punishment, turns himself in to the police to save another man from prison for life, and rescues Cosette from the Th\u00e9nardiers. Discovered by Javert in Paris because of his generosity to the poor, he evades capture for the next several years in a convent. He saves Marius from imprisonment and probable death at the barricade, reveals his true identity to Marius and Cosette after their wedding, and is reunited with them just before his death, having kept his promise to the bishop and to Fantine, the image of whom is the last thing he sees before dying.\n* '''[[Javert]]''' \u2013 A fanatic police inspector in pursuit to recapture Valjean. Born in the prisons to a convict father and a fortune teller mother, he renounces both of them and starts working as a guard in the prison, including one stint as the overseer for the chain gang of which Valjean is part (and here witnesses firsthand Valjean's enormous strength and just what he looks like). Eventually he joins the police force in Montreuil-sur-Mer. He arrests Fantine and comes into conflict with Valjean/Madeleine, who orders him to release Fantine. Valjean dismisses Javert in front of his squad and Javert, seeking revenge, reports to the Police Inspector that he has discovered Jean Valjean. He is told that he must be incorrect, as a man mistakenly believed to be Jean Valjean was just arrested. He requests of M. Madeline that he be dismissed in disgrace, for he cannot be less harsh on himself than on others. When the real Jean Valjean turns himself in, Javert is promoted to the Paris police force where he arrests Valjean and sends him back to prison. After Valjean escapes again, Javert attempts one more arrest in vain. He then almost recaptures Valjean at Gorbeau house when he arrests the Th\u00e9nardiers and [[Patron-Minette]]. Later, while working undercover behind the barricade, his identity is discovered. Valjean pretends to execute Javert, but releases him. When Javert next encounters Valjean emerging from the sewers, he allows him to make a brief visit home and then walks off instead of arresting him. Javert cannot reconcile his devotion to the law with his recognition that the lawful course is immoral. After composing a letter to the prefect of police outlining the squalid conditions that occur in prisons and the abuses that prisoners are subjected to, he takes his own life by jumping into the [[River Seine|Seine]].\n* '''[[Fantine]]''' \u2013 A beautiful Parisian [[Grisette (French)|grisette]] abandoned with a small child by her lover F\u00e9lix Tholomy\u00e8s. Fantine leaves her daughter Cosette in the care of the Th\u00e9nardiers, innkeepers in the village of [[Montfermeil]]. Mme. Th\u00e9nardier spoils her own daughters and abuses Cosette. Fantine finds work at Monsieur Madeleine's factory. Illiterate, she has others write letters to the Th\u00e9nardiers on her behalf. A female supervisor discovers that she is an unwed mother and dismisses her. To meet the Th\u00e9nardiers' repeated demands for money, she sells her hair and two front teeth, and turns to prostitution. She becomes ill. Valjean learns of her plight when Javert arrests her for attacking a man who called her insulting names and threw snow down her back, and sends her to a hospital. As Javert confronts Valjean in her hospital room, because her illness has made her so weak, she dies of shock after Javert reveals that Valjean is a convict and hasn't brought her daughter Cosette to her (after the doctor encouraged that incorrect belief that Jean Valjean's recent absence was because he was bringing her daughter to her).\n* '''[[Cosette]]''' (formally Euphrasie, also known as \"the Lark\", Mademoiselle Lanoire, Ursula) \u2013 The [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] daughter of Fantine and Tholomy\u00e8s. From approximately the age of three to the age of eight, she is beaten and forced to work as a drudge for the Th\u00e9nardiers. After her mother Fantine dies, Valjean ransoms Cosette from the Th\u00e9nardiers and cares for her as if she were his daughter. Nuns in a Paris convent educate her. She grows up to become very beautiful. She falls in love with Marius Pontmercy and marries him near the novel's conclusion.\n* '''[[Marius Pontmercy]]''' \u2013 A young law student loosely associated with the Friends of the ABC. He shares the political principles of his father and has a tempestuous relationship with his royalist grandfather, Monsieur Gillenormand. He falls in love with Cosette and fights on the barricades when he believes Valjean has taken her to London. After he and Cosette marry, he recognizes Th\u00e9nardier as a swindler and pays him to leave France.\n* '''[[\u00c9ponine]]''' (the Jondrette girl) \u2013 The Th\u00e9nardiers' elder daughter. As a child, she is pampered and spoiled by her parents, but ends up a street urchin when she reaches adolescence. She participates in her father's crimes and begging schemes to obtain money. She is blindly in love with Marius. At Marius' request, she finds Valjean and Cosette's house for him and sadly leads him there. She also prevents her father, Patron-Minette, and [[Champmathieu|Brujon]] from robbing the house during one of Marius' visits there to see Cosette. After disguising herself as a boy, she manipulates Marius into going to the barricades, hoping that she and Marius will die there together. Wanting to die before Marius, she reaches out her hand to stop a soldier from shooting at him; she is mortally wounded as the bullet goes through her hand and her back. As she is dying, she confesses all this to Marius, and gives him a letter from Cosette. Her final request to Marius is that once she has passed, he will kiss her on the forehead. He fulfills her request not because of romantic feelings on his part, but out of pity for her hard life.\n* '''[[Th\u00e9nardiers|Monsieur Th\u00e9nardier and Madame Th\u00e9nardier]]''' (also known as the Jondrettes, M. Fabantou, M. Th\u00e9nard.

As innkeepers, they abuse Cosette as a child and extort payment from Fantine for her support, until Valjean takes Cosette away. They become bankrupt and relocate under the name Jondrette to a house in Paris called the Gorbeau house, living in the room next to Marius. The husband associates with a criminal group called \"the [[Patron-Minette]]\", and conspires to rob Valjean until he is thwarted by Marius. Javert arrests the couple. The wife dies in prison. Her husband attempts to blackmail Marius with his knowledge of Valjean's past, but Marius pays him to leave the country and he becomes a slave trader in the United States.\n* '''[[Enjolras]]''' \u2013 The leader of ''Les Amis de l'ABC'' (Friends of the ABC) in the [[June Rebellion|Paris uprising]].

Grantaire is often drunk and is unconscious for the majority of the [[June Rebellion]]. He and Enjolras are executed by the National Guards after the barricade falls.\n\n===Friends of the ABC===\nA revolutionary student club.

The narrator occasionally injects himself into the narrative or reports facts outside the time of the narrative to emphasize that he is recounting historical events, not entirely fiction. He introduces his recounting of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] with several paragraphs describing the narrator's recent approach to the battlefield: \"Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person who is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles&nbsp;...\"<ref>Victor Brombert, \"''Les Mis\u00e9rables'': Salvation from Below\", in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Victor Hugo: Modern Critical Views'' (NY: Chelsea House, 1988), 198\u201399; Vol. 2, Book 1, Chapter 1</ref> The narrator describes how \"[a]n observer, a dreamer, the author of this book\" during the 1832 street fighting was caught in crossfire: \"All that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half columns which separate the shops; he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour.\" At one point he apologizes for intruding\u2014\"The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself\"\u2014to ask the reader's understanding when he describes \"the Paris of his youth&nbsp;... as though it still existed.\" This introduces a meditation on memories of past places that his contemporary readers would recognize as a self-portrait written from exile: \"you have left a part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements.\" He describes another occasion when a bullet shot \"pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended&nbsp;... over a hairdresser's shop. This pierced shaving-dish was still to be seen in 1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the pillars of the market.\" As evidence of police double agents at the barricades, he writes: \"The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the special report on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.\"\n\n==Contemporary reception==\nThe appearance of the novel was a highly anticipated event as Victor Hugo was considered one of France's foremost poets in the middle of the nineteenth century. The ''[[New York Times]]'' announced its forthcoming publication as early as April 1860.<ref>{{cite news|title=Personalities.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/10/news/personalities.html|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 April 1860}}</ref> Hugo forbade his publishers from summarizing his story and refused to authorize the publication of excerpts in advance of publication. He instructed them to build on his earlier success and suggested this approach: \"What Victor H. did for the Gothic world in ''Notre-Dame of Paris'' [''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''], he accomplishes for the modern world in ''Les Miserables''\".<ref>Behr, ''Compete Book'', 38</ref> A massive advertising campaign<ref>La r\u00e9ception des Mis\u00e9rables en 1862 \u2013 Max Bach \u2013 PMLA, Vol. 77, No. 5 (December 1962)</ref> preceded the release of the first two volumes of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in Brussels on 30 or 31 March and in Paris on 3 April 1862.<ref>{{cite web|title=les miserables, victor hugo, First Edition, 1862|url=http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/les-miserables/author/victor-hugo/first-edition/price-min/2100/pub-min/1862/pub-max/1862/sortby/1/page-1/|publisher=ABE Books|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref> The remaining volumes appeared on 15 May 1862.\n\nCritical reactions were wide-ranging and often negative. Some critics found the subject matter immoral, others complained of its excessive sentimentality, and others were disquieted by its apparent sympathy with the revolutionaries. L. Gauthier wrote in ''Le Monde'' of 17 August 1862: \"One cannot read without an unconquerable disgust all the details Monsieur Hugo gives regarding the successful planning of riots.\"<ref>[http://groupugo.div.jussieu.fr/groupugo/doc/97-03-22Bouchet.pdf PDF]</ref> The [[Goncourt brothers]] judged the novel artificial and disappointing.<ref>Goncourt, Edmond et Jules, Journal, Vol. I, Laffont, 1989, {{ISBN|2-221-05527-6}}, April 1862, pp. 808\u201309</ref> [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] found \"neither truth nor greatness\" in it. He complained that the characters were crude stereotypes who all \"speak very well \u2013 but all in the same way\". He deemed it an \"infantile\" effort and brought an end to Hugo's career like \"the fall of a god\".<ref>[http://www.univ-rouen.fr/flaubert/03corres/conard/lettres/62b.html Letter of G.
