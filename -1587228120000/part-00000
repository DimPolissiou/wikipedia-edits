The mezzanine in what is now the southern half of the station was originally the northern one. A second southern mezzanine was isolated and closed off when the original southern half of the station was closed to make way for the West End Line. However, it is still intact; it was converted to a signal relay room and can be reached by an intact stairway in the tunnel.<ref>https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/BMT_4th_Avenue_Line#36th_Street</ref>\n===Exits===\nThe station's only two exits are from the open northern [[mezzanine]] above the tracks at the very south end of the station.

On the main track level, a [[Bellmouth (railroad terminology)|bellmouth]] going east is visible from a Manhattan-bound local train,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPjuw5I22To ''The bellmouth can be seen at 58 seconds (0:58) into this video, just before the 36th Street Station.''</ref> just south of this station. When the subway was planned as part of the Triborough System, use of the South Brooklyn cut was not anticipated, and instead a four-track subway was to be built in 40th Street to reach the equivalent of the Culver and West End lines.

A second southern mezzanine was isolated and closed off when the original southern half of the station was closed to make way for the West End Line. However, it is still intact; it was converted to a signal relay room and can be reached by an intact stairway in the tunnel.<ref>https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/BMT_4th_Avenue_Line#36th_Street</ref>\n===Exits===\nThe station's only two exits are from the open northern [[mezzanine]] above the tracks at the very south end of the station. Outside [[fare control]], two street stairs lead to the northwest corner of 4th Avenue and 36th Street. Another street stair leads to the northeast corner.<ref name=\"maps\">{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Sunset Park|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/bkn/B9-Sunset_Park_2015.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=August 2, 2015|date=2015}}</ref>\n\n== Proposed subway under 40th Street ==\nThere are three abandoned trackways south of 36th Street station. One trackway merges with the southbound local track, and the other two trackways are south of the tracks that ramp up to the [[BMT West End Line]]. The triple trackway ramps down to a lower level, under the mainline tracks, and curves slightly east before ending. On the main track level, a [[Bellmouth (railroad terminology)|bellmouth]] going east is visible from a Manhattan-bound local train,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPjuw5I22To ''The bellmouth can be seen at 58 seconds (0:58) into this video, just before the 36th Street Station.''</ref> just south of this station. When the subway was planned as part of the Triborough System, use of the South Brooklyn cut was not anticipated, and instead a four-track subway was to be built in 40th Street to reach the equivalent of the Culver and West End lines. The unused junction is to the east side of Fourth Avenue.<ref name=\"tracks\" />\n\n==Nearby points of interest==\n* [[Green-Wood Cemetery]]<ref name=maps/>\n* [[Industry City]]<ref name=maps/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commonscat-inline|36th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)}}\n* {{NYCS ref|http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/stations?216:224|BMT 4th Avenue Line|36th Street}}\n* Station Reporter \u2014 [https://web.archive.org/web/20150112231643/http://www.stationreporter.net/dtrain.htm D Train]\n* Station Reporter \u2014 [https://web.archive.org/web/20120204051427/http://www.stationreporter.net/ntrain.htm N Train]\n* Station Reporter \u2014 [https://web.archive.org/web/20150113014240/http://www.stationreporter.net/rtrain.htm R Train]\n* The Subway Nut \u2014 [http://www.subwaynut.com/bmt/36d/index.php 36th Street Pictures]\n* MTA's Arts For Transit \u2014 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110606072931/http://mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=D&station=8&xdev=677 36th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)]\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=40.654345,-74.004282&spn=0,359.986567&z=17&lci=transit&layer=c&cbll=40.654442,-74.0044&panoid=n0SciIPLyAbJWBqZ6G4N-g&cbp=12,329.29,,0,8.16 36th Street entrance from Google Maps Street View]\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/@40.6543642,-74.0042419,3a,75y,76.25h,88.58t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-ztbu77CvQa0%2FV6LpQOWkq2I%2FAAAAAAAAO1w%2Fwe2KNVq4vL8Siq7q4fEa64qHvEPH30lbgCLIB!2e4!3e11!6s%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2F-ztbu77CvQa0%2FV6LpQOWkq2I%2FAAAAAAAAO1w%2Fwe2KNVq4vL8Siq7q4fEa64qHvEPH30lbgCLIB%2Fw203-h100-p-k-no%2F!7i9728!8i4864!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e1!6m1!1e1 Platform from Google Maps Street View]\n\n{{NYCS stations navbox by service|ld=y|ln=y|lr=y}}\n{{NYCS stations navbox by line|4ave=yes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:36th Street (Bmt Fourth Avenue Line)}}\n[[Category:BMT Fourth Avenue Line stations]]\n[[Category:New York City Subway stations in Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:New York City Subway stations located underground]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1915]]\n[[Category:1915 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Sunset Park, Brooklyn]]\n", "name_user": "Epicgenius", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix wording", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36th_Street_station_(BMT_Fourth_Avenue_Line)"}

In the movement for [[Sex worker rights|sex workers' rights]], sex workers establish unions and organizations, which seek to eliminate trafficking. However, law enforcement also seek to eliminate trafficking and to prosecute trafficking, and their work may infringe on sex workers' rights and agency. For example, the sex workers union DMSC (Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee) in Kolkata, India, has \"self-regulatory boards\" (SRBs) that patrol the red light districts and assist girls who are underage or trafficked. The union opposes police intervention and interferes with police efforts to bring minor girls out of brothels, on the grounds that police action might have an adverse impact on non-trafficked sex workers, especially because police officers in many places are corrupt and violent in their operations.<ref name=\"holly\">Burkhalter, Holly. \"Sex Trafficking, Law Enforcement and Perpetrator Accountability.\" Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 122133-.

In this model, male demand for prostitutes leads to a market of sex work, which, in turn, fosters sex trafficking, the illegal trade and coercion of people into sex work, and pimps and traffickers become 'distributors' who supply people to be sexually exploited. The demand for sex trafficking can also be facilitated by some pimps' and traffickers' desire for women whom they can exploit as workers because they do not require wages, safe working circumstances, and agency in choosing customers.<ref name=\"berger\"/> The link between demand for paid sex and incidences of human trafficking, as well as the \"demand for trafficking\" discourse more broadly, have never been proven empirically and have been seriously questioned by a number of scholars and organisations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gaatw.org/resources/publications/913-moving-beyond-supply-and-demand-catchphrases-assessing-the-uses-and-limitations-of-demand-based-approaches-in-anti-trafficking|title=Moving Beyond 'Supply and Demand' Catchphrases: Assessing the uses and limitations of demand-based approaches in Anti-Trafficking|last=Ham|first=Julie|date=2011|website=|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Is Trafficking in Human Beings Demand Driven?

The traffickers expect to generate huge profit from the business yet face minimal punishment or legal consequence. Human trafficking is one of the most profitable illegal industries that is second to the drug trade. While drugs are consumables, human beings can be sold repeatedly from one employer to another. The costs are low, and the profits are extremely high. Similar to employers, consumers desire to pay the lowest price and receive the highest benefit. The demand for cheap goods stimulates employers to demand cheap labour from human traffickers. High demand drives the volume of supply. \nCorporations maximise profit at the expense of trafficked labours. The low cost of illegal immigrant labour and trafficked labour in such enterprises tends to depress wages for legal labourers.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Fuels Human Trafficking? |url=https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/what-fuels-human-trafficking/31692 |website=UNICEF USA}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the United Nations, human trafficking can be closely integrated into legal businesses, including the tourism industry, agriculture, hotel and airline operations, and leisure and entertainment businesses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=U.N.

Legitimate businesses may be possibly held in competition against enterprises that are financially backed by human traffickers with illegally acquired income. Fair competition may be undermined when human trafficking victims are exploited for cheap labour, driving down production costs, thereby indirectly causing a negative economic imbalance.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grewal |first1=Silky |title=Human Trafficking: Threat To Economic Security Of A Nation |website=BusinessWorld}}</ref>\n\nBy definition, human trafficking is an organised crime, executed into action by several actors at the source, transit and destination points of trafficking. Huge profits with minimal risk incur from this offence, that is exclusively meant for the gains of its organisers and the exploiters. The revenue accrued from the Illegal industry of human trafficking does not contribute to a nation's GDP. On the contrary, it is a loss to the economy and national security of a nation, as it is a vicious cycle where this illegal activity can be accountable for funding other illegal activities. The exploitation continuously generates large sums of illegal income for criminal networks, with a corresponding threat on other legitimate businesses which have positive economic impacts.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grewal |first1=Silky |title=Human Trafficking: Threat To Economic Security Of A Nation |website=BusinessWorld}}</ref>\n\nHuman trafficking is a national threat as it blocks national growth and development. Economic costs that have been associated with human trafficking include lost labour productivity, human resources, taxable revenues, and migrant remittances, as well as unlawfully redistributed wealth and heightened law enforcement and public health costs.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons: U.S. Policy and Issues for Congress |journal=Congressional Research Service |date=February 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nTrafficking of migrants specifically has a negative impact on the potential financial gains of the migrants themselves, government and legitimate employers as income is redirected to traffickers and their associates.

For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'.<ref name=\"Agustin, Laura 2008\"/> Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.<ref name=\"rsis.edu.sg\" /> British scholar Julia O'Connell Davidson has advanced the same argument.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern slavery : the margins of freedom|last=O'Connell Davidson, Julia, 1960-|isbn=978-1-137-29727-3|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=909538560}}</ref> Furthermore, anti-trafficking actors often conflate clandestine migratory movements or voluntary sex work with forms of exploitation covered in human trafficking definitions, ignoring the fact that a migratory movement is not a requirement for human trafficking victimization.\n\nThe critics of the current approaches to trafficking say that a lot of the violence and exploitation faced by irregular migrants derives precisely from the fact that their migration and their work are illegal and not primarily because of trafficking.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = G\u00fcl\u00e7\u00fcr | first1 = Leyla | last2 = \u0130lkkaracan | first2 = P\u0131nar | title = The \"Natasha\" experience: Migrant sex workers from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in Turkey | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 411\u2013421 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(02)00278-9 | date = July\u2013August 2002 | ref = harv |url=http://www.walnet.org/csis/papers/NATASHA.PDF}}</ref>\n\nThe international [[Save the Children]] organization also stated: \"The issue, however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se\u2026trafficking and prostitution become conflated with each other\u2026On account of the historical conflation of trafficking and prostitution both legally and in popular understanding, an overwhelming degree of effort and interventions of anti-trafficking groups are concentrated on trafficking into prostitution.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |title=Definition of Trafficking \u2013 Save the Children Nepal |accessdate=2010-01-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120150137/http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |archivedate=20 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nClaudia Aradau of Open University claims that NGOs involved in anti-sex trafficking often employ \"politics of pity,\" which promotes that all trafficked victims are completely guiltless, fully coerced into sex work, and experience the same degrees of physical suffering.

Criticism includes a lack of understanding of human trafficking issues, poor identification of victims and a lack of resources for the key pillars of anti-trafficking{{snd}} identification, protection, prosecution and prevention. For example, Amnesty International has called the UK government's new anti-trafficking measures \"not fit for purpose.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Anti-trafficking measures 'not fit for purpose' and breach international law \u2013 new report |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=18820 |publisher=Amnesty.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Victim identification and protection in the UK====\nIn the UK, human trafficking cases are processed by the same officials to simultaneously determine the refugee and trafficking victim statuses of a person. However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country. A person may need assistance as a trafficking victim but his/her circumstances may not necessarily meet the threshold for asylum. In which case, not being granted refugee status affects their status as a trafficked victim and thus their ability to receive help. Reviews of the statistics from the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a tool created by the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE Convention) to help states effectively identify and care for trafficking victims, found that positive decisions for non-European Union citizens were much lower than that of EU and UK citizens. According to data on the NRM decisions from April 2009 to April 2011, an average of 82.8% of UK and EU citizens were conclusively accepted as victims while an average of only 45.9% of non-EU citizens were granted the same status.<ref>Stepnitz, Abigail. \"A Lie More Disastrous than the Truth: Asylum and the Identification of Trafficked Women in the UK.\" Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 104\u201319.

Legal procedures that involve prosecution and specifically, raids, are thus the most common anti-trafficking measures. Raids are conducted by law enforcement and by private actors and many organizations (sometimes in cooperation with law enforcement). Law enforcement perceive some benefits from raids, including the ability to locate and identify witnesses for legal processes, to dismantle \"criminal networks\", and to rescue victims from abuse.<ref name=\"ditmore\">Ditmore, Melissa, and Juhu Thukral. \"Accountability and the Use of Raids to Fight Trafficking.\" Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 134\u201348. Anti Trafficking Review. Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, June 2012. Web. 11 March 2013.</ref>\n\nThe problems against anti-trafficking raids are related to the problem of the trafficking concept itself, as raids' purpose of fighting sex trafficking may be conflated with fighting prostitution. The [[Trafficking Victims Protection Re-authorization Act of 2005]] (TVPRA) gives state and local law enforcement funding to prosecute customers of commercial sex, therefore some law enforcement agencies make no distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking. One study interviewed women who have experienced law enforcement operations as sex workers and found that during these raids meant to combat human trafficking, none of the women were ever identified as trafficking victims, and only one woman was asked whether she was coerced into sex work. The conflation of trafficking with prostitution, then, does not serve to adequately identify trafficking and help the victims. Raids are also problematic in that the women involved were most likely unclear about who was conducting the raid, what the purpose of the raid was, and what the outcomes of the raid would be.<ref name=\"ditmore\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-09-30|title=How to Stage a Raid: Police, media and the master narrative of trafficking|url=http://antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/199/196|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=7|doi=10.14197/atr.20121773}}</ref> Another study found that the majority of women \"rescued\" in anti-trafficking raids, both voluntary and coerced sex workers, eventually returned to sex work but had amassed huge amounts of debt for legal fees and other costs while they were in detention after the raid and were, overall, in a worse situation than before the raid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sangram.org/resources/RAIDED-E-Book.pdf|title=Raided: How anti-trafficking strategies increase sex workers' vulnerability to exploitative practices|last=|first=|date=2018|website=|publisher=Sangram|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nLaw enforcement personnel agree that raids can intimidate trafficked persons and render subsequent law enforcement actions unsuccessful.\nSocial workers and attorneys involved in anti-sex trafficking have negative opinions about raids. Service providers report a lack of uniform procedure for identifying trafficking victims after raids. The 26 interviewed service providers stated that local police never referred trafficked persons to them after raids. Law enforcement also often use interrogation methods that intimidate rather than assist potential trafficking victims. Additionally, sex workers sometimes face violence from the police during raids and arrests and in rehabilitation centers.<ref name=\"ditmore\" />\n\nAs raids occur to brothels that may house sex workers as well as sex trafficked victims, raids affect sex workers in general. As clients avoid brothel areas that are raided but do not stop paying for sex, voluntary sex workers will have to interact with customers underground. Underground interactions means that sex workers take greater risks, where as otherwise they would be cooperating with other sex workers and with sex worker organizations to report violence and protect each other. One example of this is with HIV prevention. Sex workers collectives monitor condom use, promote HIV testing, and cares for and monitor the health of HIV positive sex workers. Raids disrupt communal HIV care and prevention efforts, and if HIV positive sex workers are rescued and removed from their community, their treatments are disrupted, furthering the spread of AIDS.<ref name=\"ahmed\">{{Cite journal|author=Aziza Ahmed and Meena Seshu|title=\"We Have the Right Not to Be 'rescued'\u2026\"*: When Anti-Trafficking Programmes Undermine the Health and Well-Being of Sex Workers|journal=Anti Trafficking Review|volume=1|date=June 2012|pages=149\u201319|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/journals/images/documents/issue1/TheReview_article9.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812011153/http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/journals/images/documents/issue1/TheReview_article9.pdf|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nScholars Aziza Ahmed and [[Meena Seshu]] suggest reforms in law enforcement procedures so that raids are last resort, not violent, and are transparent in its purposes and processes. Furthermore, they suggest that since any trafficking victims will probably be in contact with other sex workers first, working with sex workers may be an alternative to the raid and rescue model.<ref name=\"ahmed\"/>\n\n====\"End Demand\" programs====\nCritics argue that [[End Demand]] programs are ineffective in that prostitution is not reduced, \"[[John school]]s\" have little effect on deterrence and portray prostitutes negatively, and conflicts in interest arise between law enforcement and NGO service providers. A study found that Sweden's legal experiment (criminalizing clients of prostitution and providing services to prostitutes who want to exit the industry in order to combat trafficking) did not reduce the number of prostitutes, but instead increased exploitation of sex workers because of the higher risk nature of their work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019|reason=No proper citation given for this study.}} The same study reported that johns' inclination to buy sex did not change as a result of john schools, and the programs targeted johns who are poor and colored immigrants. Some john schools also intimidate johns into not purchasing sex again by depicting prostitutes as drug addicts, HIV positive, violent, and dangerous, which further marginalizes sex workers. John schools require program fees, and police's involvement in NGOs who provide these programs create conflicts of interest especially with money involved.<ref name=\"desiree\">Wortley, S., Fischer, B., & Webster, C.

The third-wave feminist perspective of sex trafficking seeks to harmonize the dominant and liberal feminist views of sex trafficking. The dominant feminist view focuses on \"sexualized domination\", which includes issues of pornography, female sex labor in a patriarchal world, rape, and sexual harassment. Dominant feminism emphasizes sex trafficking as forced prostitution and considers the act exploitative. Liberal feminism sees all agents as capable of reason and choice. Liberal feminists support sex workers rights, and argue that women who voluntarily chose sex work are autonomous. The liberal feminist perspective finds sex trafficking problematic where it overrides consent of individuals.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|last1=Brenner|first1=Johanna|title=Selling Sexual Services: A Socialist Feminist Perspective|url=http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article34256|website=Europe Solidaire Sans Fronti\u00e8res|publisher=Syst\u00e8me de Publication pour un Internet Partag\u00e9}}</ref><ref name=\"shelley\" /><ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite web|title=Feminist Manifesto in Support of Sex Workers' Rights|url=https://feministsforsexworkers.com/|website=Feminists for Sex Workers|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Third-wave feminism]] harmonizes the thoughts that while individuals have rights, overarching inequalities hinder women's capabilities. Third-wave feminism also considers that women who are trafficked and face oppression do not all face the same kinds of oppression. For example, third-wave feminist proponent Shelley Cavalieri identifies oppression and privilege in the intersections of race, class, and gender. Women from low socioeconomic class, generally from the Global South, face inequalities that differ from those of other sex trafficking victims. Therefore, it advocates for catering to individual trafficking victim because sex trafficking is not monolithic, and therefore there is not a one-size-fits-all intervention. This also means allowing individual victims to tell their unique experiences rather than essentializing all trafficking experiences. Lastly, third-wave feminism promotes increasing women's agency both generally and individually, so that they have the opportunity to act on their own behalf.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"shelley\" /><ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n[[Third-wave feminism|Third-wave]] feminist perspective of sex trafficking is loosely related to [[Amartya Sen]]'s and [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s visions of the human capabilities approach to development. It advocates for creating viable alternatives for sex trafficking victims.  Nussbaum articulated four concepts to increase trafficking victims' capabilities: education for victims and their children, microcredit and increased employment options, labor unions for low-income women in general, and social groups that connect women to one another.<ref name=\"shelley\">CAVALIERI, SHELLEY. \"[http://ilj.law.indiana.edu/articles/86/86_4_cavalieri.pdf Between Victim And Agent: A Third-Wave Feminist Account Of Trafficking For Sex Work.]\" Indiana Law Journal86.4 (2011): 1409\u20131458.

One feminist group, led by the [[Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women]], saw trafficking as the result of globalisation and restrictive labour migration policies, with force, fraud and coercion as its defining features. The other feminist group, led by the [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] saw trafficking more narrowly as the result of men's demand for paid sex. Both groups tried to influence the definition of trafficking and other provisions in the Protocol. Eventually, both were only partially successful;<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2015-04-30|title=Purity, Victimhood and Agency: Fifteen years of the UN Trafficking Protocol|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/90/111|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=4|doi=10.14197/atr.20121544}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Sex slaves and discourse masters : the construction of trafficking|last=Doezema, Jo.|date=2010|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-415-7|location=London|oclc=650365532}}</ref> however, scholars have noted that this rift between feminist organisations led to the extremely weak and voluntary victim protection provisions of the Protocol.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chuang|first=Janie A.|date=2010|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=158|issue=6|pages=1655\u20131728|issn=0041-9907|jstor=25682362|title=Rescuing Trafficking from Ideological Capture: Prostitution Reform and Anti-Trafficking Law and Policy}}</ref>\n\n===Social norms===\nAccording to modern Feminists, women and girls are more prone to trafficking also because of [[social norms]] that marginalize their value and status in society. By this perspective females face considerable gender discrimination both at home and in school. Stereotypes that women belong at home in the private sphere and that women are less valuable because they do not and are not allowed to contribute to formal employment and monetary gains the same way men do further marginalize women's status relative to men.

In the movement for [[Sex worker rights|sex workers' rights]], sex workers establish unions and organizations, which seek to eliminate trafficking. However, law enforcement also seek to eliminate trafficking and to prosecute trafficking, and their work may infringe on sex workers' rights and agency. For example, the sex workers union DMSC (Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee) in Kolkata, India, has \"self-regulatory boards\" (SRBs) that patrol the red light districts and assist girls who are underage or trafficked. The union opposes police intervention and interferes with police efforts to bring minor girls out of brothels, on the grounds that police action might have an adverse impact on non-trafficked sex workers, especially because police officers in many places are corrupt and violent in their operations.<ref name=\"holly\">Burkhalter, Holly. \"Sex Trafficking, Law Enforcement and Perpetrator Accountability.\" Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 122133-.

In this model, male demand for prostitutes leads to a market of sex work, which, in turn, fosters sex trafficking, the illegal trade and coercion of people into sex work, and pimps and traffickers become 'distributors' who supply people to be sexually exploited. The demand for sex trafficking can also be facilitated by some pimps' and traffickers' desire for women whom they can exploit as workers because they do not require wages, safe working circumstances, and agency in choosing customers.<ref name=\"berger\"/> The link between demand for paid sex and incidences of human trafficking, as well as the \"demand for trafficking\" discourse more broadly, have never been proven empirically and have been seriously questioned by a number of scholars and organisations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gaatw.org/resources/publications/913-moving-beyond-supply-and-demand-catchphrases-assessing-the-uses-and-limitations-of-demand-based-approaches-in-anti-trafficking|title=Moving Beyond 'Supply and Demand' Catchphrases: Assessing the uses and limitations of demand-based approaches in Anti-Trafficking|last=Ham|first=Julie|date=2011|website=|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Is Trafficking in Human Beings Demand Driven?

The traffickers expect to generate huge profit from the business yet face minimal punishment or legal consequence. Human trafficking is one of the most profitable illegal industries that is second to the drug trade. While drugs are consumables, human beings can be sold repeatedly from one employer to another. The costs are low, and the profits are extremely high. Similar to employers, consumers desire to pay the lowest price and receive the highest benefit. The demand for cheap goods stimulates employers to demand cheap labour from human traffickers. High demand drives the volume of supply. \nCorporations maximise profit at the expense of trafficked labours. The low cost of illegal immigrant labour and trafficked labour in such enterprises tends to depress wages for legal labourers.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Fuels Human Trafficking? |url=https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/what-fuels-human-trafficking/31692 |website=UNICEF USA}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the United Nations, human trafficking can be closely integrated into legal businesses, including the tourism industry, agriculture, hotel and airline operations, and leisure and entertainment businesses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=U.N.

Legitimate businesses may be possibly held in competition against enterprises that are financially backed by human traffickers with illegally acquired income. Fair competition may be undermined when human trafficking victims are exploited for cheap labour, driving down production costs, thereby indirectly causing a negative economic imbalance.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grewal |first1=Silky |title=Human Trafficking: Threat To Economic Security Of A Nation |website=BusinessWorld}}</ref>\n\nBy definition, human trafficking is an organised crime, executed into action by several actors at the source, transit and destination points of trafficking. Huge profits with minimal risk incur from this offence, that is exclusively meant for the gains of its organisers and the exploiters. The revenue accrued from the Illegal industry of human trafficking does not contribute to a nation's GDP. On the contrary, it is a loss to the economy and national security of a nation, as it is a vicious cycle where this illegal activity can be accountable for funding other illegal activities. The exploitation continuously generates large sums of illegal income for criminal networks, with a corresponding threat on other legitimate businesses which have positive economic impacts.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grewal |first1=Silky |title=Human Trafficking: Threat To Economic Security Of A Nation |website=BusinessWorld}}</ref>\n\nHuman trafficking is a national threat as it blocks national growth and development. Economic costs that have been associated with human trafficking include lost labour productivity, human resources, taxable revenues, and migrant remittances, as well as unlawfully redistributed wealth and heightened law enforcement and public health costs.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons: U.S. Policy and Issues for Congress |journal=Congressional Research Service |date=February 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nTrafficking of migrants specifically has a negative impact on the potential financial gains of the migrants themselves, government and legitimate employers as income is redirected to traffickers and their associates.

For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'.<ref name=\"Agustin, Laura 2008\"/> Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.<ref name=\"rsis.edu.sg\" /> British scholar Julia O'Connell Davidson has advanced the same argument.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern slavery : the margins of freedom|last=O'Connell Davidson, Julia, 1960-|isbn=978-1-137-29727-3|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=909538560}}</ref> Furthermore, anti-trafficking actors often conflate clandestine migratory movements or voluntary sex work with forms of exploitation covered in human trafficking definitions, ignoring the fact that a migratory movement is not a requirement for human trafficking victimization.\n\nThe critics of the current approaches to trafficking say that a lot of the violence and exploitation faced by irregular migrants derives precisely from the fact that their migration and their work are illegal and not primarily because of trafficking.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = G\u00fcl\u00e7\u00fcr | first1 = Leyla | last2 = \u0130lkkaracan | first2 = P\u0131nar | title = The \"Natasha\" experience: Migrant sex workers from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in Turkey | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 411\u2013421 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(02)00278-9 | date = July\u2013August 2002 | ref = harv |url=http://www.walnet.org/csis/papers/NATASHA.PDF}}</ref>\n\nThe international [[Save the Children]] organization also stated: \"The issue, however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se\u2026trafficking and prostitution become conflated with each other\u2026On account of the historical conflation of trafficking and prostitution both legally and in popular understanding, an overwhelming degree of effort and interventions of anti-trafficking groups are concentrated on trafficking into prostitution.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |title=Definition of Trafficking \u2013 Save the Children Nepal |accessdate=2010-01-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120150137/http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |archivedate=20 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nClaudia Aradau of Open University claims that NGOs involved in anti-sex trafficking often employ \"politics of pity,\" which promotes that all trafficked victims are completely guiltless, fully coerced into sex work, and experience the same degrees of physical suffering.

Criticism includes a lack of understanding of human trafficking issues, poor identification of victims and a lack of resources for the key pillars of anti-trafficking{{snd}} identification, protection, prosecution and prevention. For example, Amnesty International has called the UK government's new anti-trafficking measures \"not fit for purpose.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Anti-trafficking measures 'not fit for purpose' and breach international law \u2013 new report |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=18820 |publisher=Amnesty.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Victim identification and protection in the UK====\nIn the UK, human trafficking cases are processed by the same officials to simultaneously determine the refugee and trafficking victim statuses of a person. However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country. A person may need assistance as a trafficking victim but his/her circumstances may not necessarily meet the threshold for asylum. In which case, not being granted refugee status affects their status as a trafficked victim and thus their ability to receive help. Reviews of the statistics from the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a tool created by the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE Convention) to help states effectively identify and care for trafficking victims, found that positive decisions for non-European Union citizens were much lower than that of EU and UK citizens. According to data on the NRM decisions from April 2009 to April 2011, an average of 82.8% of UK and EU citizens were conclusively accepted as victims while an average of only 45.9% of non-EU citizens were granted the same status.<ref>Stepnitz, Abigail. \"A Lie More Disastrous than the Truth: Asylum and the Identification of Trafficked Women in the UK.\" Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 104\u201319.

Legal procedures that involve prosecution and specifically, raids, are thus the most common anti-trafficking measures. Raids are conducted by law enforcement and by private actors and many organizations (sometimes in cooperation with law enforcement). Law enforcement perceive some benefits from raids, including the ability to locate and identify witnesses for legal processes, to dismantle \"criminal networks\", and to rescue victims from abuse.<ref name=\"ditmore\">Ditmore, Melissa, and Juhu Thukral. \"Accountability and the Use of Raids to Fight Trafficking.\" Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 134\u201348. Anti Trafficking Review. Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, June 2012. Web. 11 March 2013.</ref>\n\nThe problems against anti-trafficking raids are related to the problem of the trafficking concept itself, as raids' purpose of fighting sex trafficking may be conflated with fighting prostitution. The [[Trafficking Victims Protection Re-authorization Act of 2005]] (TVPRA) gives state and local law enforcement funding to prosecute customers of commercial sex, therefore some law enforcement agencies make no distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking. One study interviewed women who have experienced law enforcement operations as sex workers and found that during these raids meant to combat human trafficking, none of the women were ever identified as trafficking victims, and only one woman was asked whether she was coerced into sex work. The conflation of trafficking with prostitution, then, does not serve to adequately identify trafficking and help the victims. Raids are also problematic in that the women involved were most likely unclear about who was conducting the raid, what the purpose of the raid was, and what the outcomes of the raid would be.<ref name=\"ditmore\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-09-30|title=How to Stage a Raid: Police, media and the master narrative of trafficking|url=http://antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/199/196|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=7|doi=10.14197/atr.20121773}}</ref> Another study found that the majority of women \"rescued\" in anti-trafficking raids, both voluntary and coerced sex workers, eventually returned to sex work but had amassed huge amounts of debt for legal fees and other costs while they were in detention after the raid and were, overall, in a worse situation than before the raid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sangram.org/resources/RAIDED-E-Book.pdf|title=Raided: How anti-trafficking strategies increase sex workers' vulnerability to exploitative practices|last=|first=|date=2018|website=|publisher=Sangram|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nLaw enforcement personnel agree that raids can intimidate trafficked persons and render subsequent law enforcement actions unsuccessful.\nSocial workers and attorneys involved in anti-sex trafficking have negative opinions about raids. Service providers report a lack of uniform procedure for identifying trafficking victims after raids. The 26 interviewed service providers stated that local police never referred trafficked persons to them after raids. Law enforcement also often use interrogation methods that intimidate rather than assist potential trafficking victims. Additionally, sex workers sometimes face violence from the police during raids and arrests and in rehabilitation centers.<ref name=\"ditmore\" />\n\nAs raids occur to brothels that may house sex workers as well as sex trafficked victims, raids affect sex workers in general. As clients avoid brothel areas that are raided but do not stop paying for sex, voluntary sex workers will have to interact with customers underground. Underground interactions means that sex workers take greater risks, where as otherwise they would be cooperating with other sex workers and with sex worker organizations to report violence and protect each other. One example of this is with HIV prevention. Sex workers collectives monitor condom use, promote HIV testing, and cares for and monitor the health of HIV positive sex workers. Raids disrupt communal HIV care and prevention efforts, and if HIV positive sex workers are rescued and removed from their community, their treatments are disrupted, furthering the spread of AIDS.<ref name=\"ahmed\">{{Cite journal|author=Aziza Ahmed and Meena Seshu|title=\"We Have the Right Not to Be 'rescued'\u2026\"*: When Anti-Trafficking Programmes Undermine the Health and Well-Being of Sex Workers|journal=Anti Trafficking Review|volume=1|date=June 2012|pages=149\u201319|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/journals/images/documents/issue1/TheReview_article9.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812011153/http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/journals/images/documents/issue1/TheReview_article9.pdf|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nScholars Aziza Ahmed and [[Meena Seshu]] suggest reforms in law enforcement procedures so that raids are last resort, not violent, and are transparent in its purposes and processes. Furthermore, they suggest that since any trafficking victims will probably be in contact with other sex workers first, working with sex workers may be an alternative to the raid and rescue model.<ref name=\"ahmed\"/>\n\n====\"End Demand\" programs====\nCritics argue that [[End Demand]] programs are ineffective in that prostitution is not reduced, \"[[John school]]s\" have little effect on deterrence and portray prostitutes negatively, and conflicts in interest arise between law enforcement and NGO service providers. A study found that Sweden's legal experiment (criminalizing clients of prostitution and providing services to prostitutes who want to exit the industry in order to combat trafficking) did not reduce the number of prostitutes, but instead increased exploitation of sex workers because of the higher risk nature of their work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019|reason=No proper citation given for this study.}} The same study reported that johns' inclination to buy sex did not change as a result of john schools, and the programs targeted johns who are poor and colored immigrants. Some john schools also intimidate johns into not purchasing sex again by depicting prostitutes as drug addicts, HIV positive, violent, and dangerous, which further marginalizes sex workers. John schools require program fees, and police's involvement in NGOs who provide these programs create conflicts of interest especially with money involved.<ref name=\"desiree\">Wortley, S., Fischer, B., & Webster, C.

The third-wave feminist perspective of sex trafficking seeks to harmonize the dominant and liberal feminist views of sex trafficking. The dominant feminist view focuses on \"sexualized domination\", which includes issues of pornography, female sex labor in a patriarchal world, rape, and sexual harassment. Dominant feminism emphasizes sex trafficking as forced prostitution and considers the act exploitative. Liberal feminism sees all agents as capable of reason and choice. Liberal feminists support sex workers rights, and argue that women who voluntarily chose sex work are autonomous. The liberal feminist perspective finds sex trafficking problematic where it overrides consent of individuals.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|last1=Brenner|first1=Johanna|title=Selling Sexual Services: A Socialist Feminist Perspective|url=http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article34256|website=Europe Solidaire Sans Fronti\u00e8res|publisher=Syst\u00e8me de Publication pour un Internet Partag\u00e9}}</ref><ref name=\"shelley\" /><ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite web|title=Feminist Manifesto in Support of Sex Workers' Rights|url=https://feministsforsexworkers.com/|website=Feminists for Sex Workers|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Third-wave feminism]] harmonizes the thoughts that while individuals have rights, overarching inequalities hinder women's capabilities. Third-wave feminism also considers that women who are trafficked and face oppression do not all face the same kinds of oppression. For example, third-wave feminist proponent Shelley Cavalieri identifies oppression and privilege in the intersections of race, class, and gender. Women from low socioeconomic class, generally from the Global South, face inequalities that differ from those of other sex trafficking victims. Therefore, it advocates for catering to individual trafficking victim because sex trafficking is not monolithic, and therefore there is not a one-size-fits-all intervention. This also means allowing individual victims to tell their unique experiences rather than essentializing all trafficking experiences. Lastly, third-wave feminism promotes increasing women's agency both generally and individually, so that they have the opportunity to act on their own behalf.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"shelley\" /><ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n[[Third-wave feminism|Third-wave]] feminist perspective of sex trafficking is loosely related to [[Amartya Sen]]'s and [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s visions of the human capabilities approach to development. It advocates for creating viable alternatives for sex trafficking victims.  Nussbaum articulated four concepts to increase trafficking victims' capabilities: education for victims and their children, microcredit and increased employment options, labor unions for low-income women in general, and social groups that connect women to one another.<ref name=\"shelley\">CAVALIERI, SHELLEY. \"[http://ilj.law.indiana.edu/articles/86/86_4_cavalieri.pdf Between Victim And Agent: A Third-Wave Feminist Account Of Trafficking For Sex Work.]\" Indiana Law Journal86.4 (2011): 1409\u20131458.

One feminist group, led by the [[Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women]], saw trafficking as the result of globalisation and restrictive labour migration policies, with force, fraud and coercion as its defining features. The other feminist group, led by the [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] saw trafficking more narrowly as the result of men's demand for paid sex. Both groups tried to influence the definition of trafficking and other provisions in the Protocol. Eventually, both were only partially successful;<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2015-04-30|title=Purity, Victimhood and Agency: Fifteen years of the UN Trafficking Protocol|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/90/111|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=4|doi=10.14197/atr.20121544}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Sex slaves and discourse masters : the construction of trafficking|last=Doezema, Jo.|date=2010|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-415-7|location=London|oclc=650365532}}</ref> however, scholars have noted that this rift between feminist organisations led to the extremely weak and voluntary victim protection provisions of the Protocol.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chuang|first=Janie A.|date=2010|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=158|issue=6|pages=1655\u20131728|issn=0041-9907|jstor=25682362|title=Rescuing Trafficking from Ideological Capture: Prostitution Reform and Anti-Trafficking Law and Policy}}</ref>\n\n===Social norms===\nAccording to modern Feminists, women and girls are more prone to trafficking also because of [[social norms]] that marginalize their value and status in society. By this perspective females face considerable gender discrimination both at home and in school. Stereotypes that women belong at home in the private sphere and that women are less valuable because they do not and are not allowed to contribute to formal employment and monetary gains the same way men do further marginalize women's status relative to men.

Vishnu is said to descend in form of an avatar to restore cosmic order. The word ''Dashavatara'' derives from {{IAST|da\u015ba}}, meaning 'ten', and avatar ({{IAST|avat\u0101ra}}), roughly equivalent to 'incarnation'.\n\nThe list of included avatars varies across sects and regions, particularly in respect to the inclusion of [[Balarama]] (brother of [[Krishna]]) or the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].

In traditions that omit Krishna, he often replaces Vishnu as the source of all avatars. Some traditions include a regional deity such as [[Vithoba]]<ref name=\"maharashtra.gov.in\"/> or [[Jagannath]]{{sfn|Leyden|1982|p=22}} in penultimate position, replacing Krishna or Buddha.

Vishnu takes the form of a fish to save [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] from the [[Flood myth|deluge]] ([[Pralaya]]), after which he takes his boat to the new world along with one of every species of plant and animal, gathered in a massive cyclone.\n* 2 - '''[[Kurma]]''', the giant tortoise. When the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and [[Asura|asuras]] were churning the [[Ocean of milk]] in order to get [[Amrita]], the nectar of immortality, the mount Mandara they were using as the churning staff started to sink and Vishnu took the form of a tortoise to bear the weight of the mountain.\n* 3 - '''[[Varaha]]''', the boar. He appeared to defeat [[Hiranyaksha]], a demon who had taken the Earth, or [[Prithvi]], and carried it to the bottom of what is described as the cosmic ocean (much like in ether theory) in the story. The battle between Varaha and Hiranyaksha is believed to have lasted for a thousand years, which the former finally won. Varaha carried the Earth out of the ocean between his tusks and restored it to its place in the universe.\n* 4 - '''[[Narasimha]]''', the half-man/half-lion. The ''[[rakshasa]] (Demon)'' [[Hiranyakashyapa]], the elder brother of Hiranyaksha, was granted a powerful boon from [[Brahma]] that he could not be killed by man or animal, inside or outside a room, during day or night, neither on ground nor in air, with a weapon that is either living or inanimate. Hiranyakashipu persecuted everyone for their religious beliefs including his son who was a Vishnu follower.<ref name=\"Soifer1991p73\"/> Vishnu descended as an anthropomorphic incarnation, with the body of a man and head and claws of a lion. He disemboweled Hiranyakashipu at the courtyard threshold of his house, at dusk, with his claws, while he lay on his thighs. Narasimha thus destroyed the evil demon and brought an end to the persecution of human beings including his devotee [[Prahlada]], according to the Hindu mythology.<ref name=\"Soifer1991p73\">{{cite book|author=Deborah A.

The fourth descendant of Vishnu, [[Bali (demon)|Bali]], with devotion and penance was able to defeat [[Indra]], the god of firmament.

The gods appealed to Vishnu for protection and he descended as a boy Vamana.<ref name=\"Soifer1991p33\">{{cite book|author=Deborah A.

Vamana asked for three paces of land. Bali agreed, and the dwarf then changed his size to that of a giant ''Trivikrama'' form.<ref name=\"Soifer1991p33\"/> With his first stride he covered the earthly realm, with the second he covered the heavenly realm thereby symbolically covering the abode of all living beings.<ref name=\"Soifer1991p33\"/> He then took the third stride for the netherworld. Bali realized that Vamana was [[Vishnu]] incarnate. In deference, the king offered his head as the third place for Vamana to place his foot. The avatar did so and thus granted Bali immortality and making him ruler of Pathala, the netherworld.

He is son of [[Jamadagni]] and [[Renuka]] and was granted as boon, an axe after a penance to [[Shiva]]. He is the first Brahmin-Kshatriya in Hinduism, or warrior-sage, who had to follow the [[Dharma]] of both, a [[Brahmin]] as well as a [[Kshatriya]]. Once, when king [[Kartavirya Arjuna]] and his hunting party halted at the ashrama of Jamadagni, the father of Parashurama, and the sage was able to feed them all with the aid of the divine cow [[Kamadhenu]]. The king demanded the cow, but Jamadagni refused. Enraged, the king took it by force and destroyed the ashram. Parashurama then killed the king at his palace and destroyed his army. In revenge, the sons of Kartavirya killed Jamadagni. Parashurama took a vow to kill every Kshatriya on earth twenty-one times over, and filled five lakes with their blood. Ultimately, his grandfather, [[rishi]] Rucheeka, appeared before him and made him halt. He is a [[chiranjeevi]] (immortal), and believed to be alive today in penance at [[Mahendra Mountains|Mahendragiri]]. He also credited for creating Kerala by throwing his mighty axe as per Hindu mythology. The place the axe landed in sea got its water displaced and the land which emerged thus came to be known as Kerala.\n[[File:Anantashayana Vishnu with Lakshmi, his avatars above him (annotated), Badami monuments Karnataka.jpg|thumb|[[Anantashayana Vishnu]] with [[Lakshmi]], his ten avatars above him (annotated), 6th \u2013 8th century [[Badami Cave Temples|Badami]], Karnataka]]\n* 7 - '''[[Rama]]''', the prince and king of [[Ayodhya]]. He is a commonly worshipped avatar in [[Hinduism]], and is thought of as the ideal model of a common prince without super powers, despite being an incarnation. His story is recounted in one of the most widely read scriptures of Hinduism, the ''[[Ramayana]]''. While in exile from his own kingdom with his brother [[Lakshman]] and the God [[Hanuman]], his wife [[Sita]] was abducted by the demon king of [[Lanka]], [[Ravana]]. He travelled to Lanka, killed the demon king and saved Sita. Rama and Sita returned home and were crowned. But later, due to constant tantrums by his citizens, he exiled Sita and his unborn sons out of his kingdom. Rama had won one of the greatest and most honest wars, but still lived most of his adult life in exile or in misery.  \n* [8] - '''[[Balarama]]''', the elder brother of Krishna, is regarded generally as an avatar of [[Shesha]] an extension of Ananta, a form of Lord Vishnu . Balarama is included as the eighth avatar of Vishnu in the [[Sri Vaishnava]] lists, where Buddha is omitted and Krishna appears as the ninth avatar in this list.{{sfn|Carman|1994|p=211-212}} He is particularly included in the lists where Krishna is removed and becomes the source of all.\n\n:* [9{{sfn|Carman|1994|p=211-212}} or 8{{sfn|Wuaku|2013|p=148}} or \"0\"] - '''[[Krishna]]''' was the eighth son of [[Devaki]] and [[Vasudeva]]. A frequently worshipped deity in Hinduism, he is the hero of various legends and embodies qualities such as love and playfulness. In some lists Krishna is removed and becomes the source of all. Krishna is the mirror opposite of Rama. Rama was a strict follower of honesty, integrity and monogamy, while Krishna had 8 wives, and used any available means to get to his goal.\n:* [9] - '''[[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]]''': [[Gautama Buddha]], the founder of Buddhism, is commonly included as an avatar of Vishnu in Hinduism. Buddha is sometimes depicted in Hindu scriptures as a preacher who deludes and leads demons and heretics away from the path of the [[Vedas|Vedic scriptures]], but another view praises him a compassionate teacher who preached the path of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence).{{sfn|Wuaku|2013|p=148}}{{sfn|Carman|1994|p=211-212}}<!--** START OF NOTE **--><ref group=note name=\"Buddha\">\nBuddha as an avatar of Vishnu:\n;Krishna, Buddha\n''Printed sources''\n* Bansal, Sunita Pant, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xhrnkdByWDIC&pg=PA27&dq=dashavatara&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GIa6UoWkCIeJrgfUoICYCw&ved=0CFMQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=Buddha&f=false ''Hindu Gods and Goddesses''], p.27, \"Vishnu Dashavatara\";\n* {{Citation | last =Dalal | first =Roshen | year =2010 | title =Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide | publisher =Penguin Books India | url =https://books.google.com/?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&pg=PA112&dq=dashavatara#v=onepage&q=dashavatara&f=false| isbn =9780143414216 }}, p.112, \"Dashavatara\".

Similarly, the Buddha is claimed in the Theravada mythology to have been born when ''dharma'' is in decline, so as to preserve and uphold the ''dharma''. These similarities may have contributed to the assimilation of the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu.{{sfn|Holt|2013|pp=14-15}}\n\nThe adoption of [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]] as an avatar in [[Bhagavatism]] was a catalyzing factor in Buddhism's assimilation into Vaishnavism's mythic hierarchy.

When the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and [[Asura|asuras]] were churning the [[Ocean of milk]] in order to get [[Amrita]], the nectar of immortality, the mount Mandara they were using as the churning staff started to sink and Vishnu took the form of a tortoise to bear the weight of the mountain.\n* 3 - '''[[Varaha]]''', the boar. He appeared to defeat [[Hiranyaksha]], a demon who had taken the Earth, or [[Prithvi]], and carried it to the bottom of what is described as the cosmic ocean (much like in ether theory) in the story. The battle between Varaha and Hiranyaksha is believed to have lasted for a thousand years, which the former finally won. Varaha carried the Earth out of the ocean between his tusks and restored it to its place in the universe.\n* 4 - '''[[Narasimha]]''', the half-man/half-lion. The ''[[rakshasa]] (Demon)'' [[Hiranyakashyapa]], the elder brother of Hiranyaksha, was granted a powerful boon from [[Brahma]] that he could not be killed by man or animal, inside or outside a room, during day or night, neither on ground nor in air, with a weapon that is either living or inanimate. Hiranyakashipu persecuted everyone for their religious beliefs including his son who was a Vishnu follower.<ref name=\"Soifer1991p73\"/> Vishnu descended as an anthropomorphic incarnation, with the body of a man and head and claws of a lion.

He is son of [[Jamadagni]] and [[Renuka]] and was granted as boon, an axe after a penance to [[Shiva]]. He is the first Brahmin-Kshatriya in Hinduism, or warrior-sage, who had to follow the [[Dharma]] of both, a [[Brahmin]] as well as a [[Kshatriya]]. Once, when king [[Kartavirya Arjuna]] and his hunting party halted at the ashrama of Jamadagni, the father of Parashurama, and the sage was able to feed them all with the aid of the divine cow [[Kamadhenu]]. The king demanded the cow, but Jamadagni refused. Enraged, the king took it by force and destroyed the ashram. Parashurama then killed the king at his palace and destroyed his army. In revenge, the sons of Kartavirya killed Jamadagni. Parashurama took a vow to kill every Kshatriya on earth twenty-one times over, and filled five lakes with their blood. Ultimately, his grandfather, [[rishi]] Rucheeka, appeared before him and made him halt. He is a [[chiranjeevi]] (immortal), and believed to be alive today in penance at [[Mahendra Mountains|Mahendragiri]]. He also credited for creating Kerala by throwing his mighty axe as per Hindu mythology. The place the axe landed in sea got its water displaced and the land which emerged thus came to be known as Kerala.\n[[File:Anantashayana Vishnu with Lakshmi, his avatars above him (annotated), Badami monuments Karnataka.jpg|thumb|[[Anantashayana Vishnu]] with [[Lakshmi]], his ten avatars above him (annotated), 6th \u2013 8th century [[Badami Cave Temples|Badami]], Karnataka]]\n* 7 - '''[[Rama]]''', the prince and king of [[Ayodhya]]. He is a commonly worshipped avatar in [[Hinduism]], and is thought of as the ideal model of a common prince without super powers, despite being an incarnation. His story is recounted in one of the most widely read scriptures of Hinduism, the ''[[Ramayana]]''. While in exile from his own kingdom with his brother [[Lakshman]] and the God [[Hanuman]], his wife [[Sita]] was abducted by the demon king of [[Lanka]], [[Ravana]]. He travelled to Lanka, killed the demon king and saved Sita. Rama and Sita returned home and were crowned. But later, due to constant tantrums by his citizens, he exiled Sita and his unborn sons out of his kingdom. Rama had won one of the greatest and most honest wars, but still lived most of his adult life in exile or in misery.  \n* [8] - '''[[Balarama]]''', the elder brother of Krishna, is regarded generally as an avatar of [[Shesha]] an extension of Ananta, a form of Lord Vishnu .

A frequently worshipped deity in Hinduism, he is the hero of various legends and embodies qualities such as love and playfulness. In some lists Krishna is removed and becomes the source of all. Krishna is the mirror opposite of Rama. Rama was a strict follower of honesty, integrity and monogamy, while Krishna had 8 wives, and used any available means to get to his goal.\n:* [9] - '''[[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]]''': [[Gautama Buddha]], the founder of Buddhism, is commonly included as an avatar of Vishnu in Hinduism.

Similarly, the Buddha is claimed in the Theravada mythology to have been born when ''dharma'' is in decline, so as to preserve and uphold the ''dharma''. These similarities may have contributed to the assimilation of the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu.{{sfn|Holt|2013|pp=14-15}}\n\nThe adoption of [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]] as an avatar in [[Bhagavatism]] was a catalyzing factor in Buddhism's assimilation into Vaishnavism's mythic hierarchy.
