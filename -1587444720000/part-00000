In 1804, he gave money to [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] to purchase [[Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay]], a large estate outside Paris. The ch\u00e2teau was intended to act as a kind of diplomatic gathering place. When Talleyrand moved there, he took Car\u00eame with him.\n\nCar\u00eame was set a test by Talleyrand: to create a whole year\u2019s worth of menus, without repetition, and using only seasonal produce. Car\u00eame passed the test and completed his training in Talleyrand's kitchens. After the fall of Napoleon, Car\u00eame went to London for a time and served as ''chef de cuisine'' to the [[Prince Regent]], later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]].

This healthy diet includes a wide range of non-starchy vegetables and fruits which provide different colors including red, green, yellow, white, purple, and orange. The recommendations note that tomato cooked with oil, allium vegetables like garlic, and [[cruciferous vegetables]] like cauliflower, provide some protection against cancer. This healthy diet is low in energy density, which may protect against weight gain and associated diseases. Finally, limiting consumption of sugary drinks, limiting energy rich foods, including \u201cfast foods\u201d and red meat, and avoiding processed meats improves health and longevity.

This healthy diet includes a wide range of non-starchy vegetables and fruits which provide different colors including red, green, yellow, white, purple, and orange. The recommendations note that tomato cooked with oil, allium vegetables like garlic, and [[cruciferous vegetables]] like cauliflower, provide some protection against cancer. This healthy diet is low in energy density, which may protect against weight gain and associated diseases. Finally, limiting consumption of sugary drinks, limiting energy rich foods, including \u201cfast foods\u201d and red meat, and avoiding processed meats improves health and longevity.

The report harshly criticized the school for not supporting the victims when they reported the incidents and for a pattern of not including these allegations in the faculty members' files. Apparently, the school maintained two sets of files, and would keep the more sensitive material away from Human Resources and prospective employers. Typically, faculty members would then leave Exeter but get hired at peer schools. In at least one case, the teacher then molested students at his next school. The school has apologized.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/phillips-exeter-academy-new-hampshire-former-staffers-accused-of-abuse-2018-08-25/| title=11 former New Hampshire prep school staffers accused of abuse| work=CBS News| date=August 25, 2018| access-date=August 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/us/phillips-exeter-sex-assault.html| last1=P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a| first1=Richard| title=Phillips Exeter Deans Failed to Report Sex Assault Case, Police Say| date=November 14, 2017| access-date=August 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Emblems==\n\n===Academy seal===\nExeter has two chief symbols: a seal depicting a river, sun and [[beehive]], incorporating the academy's mottos; and the ''Lion Rampant''.

John Phillips had made his fortune as a merchant and banker before going into public service, and financially supported his nephew [[Samuel Phillips, Jr.]] in founding his own school, [[Phillips Academy]], in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], three years earlier.

Today at Phillips Exeter Academy, all classes are taught using this method, with no more than 12 or 13. In November 1930, Harkness gave Exeter $5.8 million to support this initiative.

Access Exeter curriculum consists of six academic clusters; each cluster consists of three courses organized around a focused central theme. Some of Exeter's summer school programs also give students the opportunity to experience studies outside of Exeter's campus environment, including interactions with other top schools and students, experience with Washington D.C., and travel abroad.<ref>{{cite web|last=The Trustees of Phillips Exeter Academy|title=Phillips Exeter Academy {{!}} Academic Programs|url=http://www.exeter.edu/summer_programs/7324_7416.aspx|accessdate=January 7, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116051529/http://www.exeter.edu/summer_programs/7324_7416.aspx|archivedate=January 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Workshops===\nThe academy offers a number of workshops and conferences for secondary school educators.

The loops are fitted with radio controls so that train crew can set the points as they approach.

In this case, best practices for getting a good face seal include trying different models or sizes, using a mirror or asking a colleague to check that the respirator is touching the face, and doing multiple user seal checks.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGiven that the global supply of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) is insufficient during the pandemic, the [[World Health Organization]] recommends minimizing the need for PPE through [[telemedicine]], physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE [[supply chain]], and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite web|url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331215/WHO-2019-nCov-IPCPPE_use-2020.1-eng.pdf|title=Rational use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)|last=|first=|date=2020-02-27|website=World Health Organization|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nWhen it is no longer possible for all healthcare workers to wear N95 respirators when caring for a COVID-19 patient, CDC recommends that respirators be prioritized for workers performing aerosol-generating procedures on symptomatic persons, and those within three feet of an unmasked symptomatic person. Under these conditions, masking of symptomatic patients with a [[surgical mask]] and maintaining distance from the patient are particularly important to reduce the risk of transmission.  When no respirators are left, workers who are at higher risk for severe illness may be excluded from caring for patients, and workers who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 may be preferred to care for patients.  Portable fans with [[HEPA]] filters may also be used to increase ventilation in isolation rooms when surgical masks are being used in place of respirators.  If neither respirators nor surgical masks are available, as a last resort, it may be necessary for healthcare workers to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH or homemade masks, such as [[Cloth face mask|cloth face masks]], though caution should be exercised when considering this option.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Decontamination ====\nDisposable filtering facepiece respirators such as N95 masks are not approved for routine decontamination and reuse as standard of care.

Under these conditions, masking of symptomatic patients with a [[surgical mask]] and maintaining distance from the patient are particularly important to reduce the risk of transmission.  When no respirators are left, workers who are at higher risk for severe illness may be excluded from caring for patients, and workers who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 may be preferred to care for patients.  Portable fans with [[HEPA]] filters may also be used to increase ventilation in isolation rooms when surgical masks are being used in place of respirators.  If neither respirators nor surgical masks are available, as a last resort, it may be necessary for healthcare workers to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH or homemade masks, such as [[Cloth face mask|cloth face masks]], though caution should be exercised when considering this option.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Decontamination ====\nDisposable filtering facepiece respirators such as N95 masks are not approved for routine decontamination and reuse as standard of care.
