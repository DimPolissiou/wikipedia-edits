The scrotum is developmentally homologous to the [[labia majora]]. The raphe does not exist in females. Reproductive organs and tissues develop in females and males begin during the fifth week after fertilization.  The gonadal ridge grows behind the peritoneal membrane.  By the sixth week, string-like tissues called primary sex cords form within the enlarging gonadal ridge.  Externally, a swelling called the genital tubercule appears over the cloacal membrane.\n\nUp until the eighth week after fertilization, the reproductive organs do not appear to be different between the male and female and are called in-differentiated.  Testosterone secretion starts during week eight, reaches peak levels during week 13 and eventually declines to very low levels by the end of the second trimester. The testosterone causes the masculinization of the labioscrotal folds into the scrotum. The scrotal raphe is formed when the embryonic, urethral groove closes by week 12.{{sfn|Van de Graaff|1989|p=927-931}}\n\n===Scrotal growth and puberty=== \nThough the testes and scrotum form early in embryonic life, sexual maturation begins upon entering [[puberty]]. The increased secretion of testosterone causes the darkening of the skin and development of pubic hair on the scrotum.{{sfn|Van de Graaff|1989|p=935}}\n\n== Function ==\nThe scrotum regulates the temperature of the testes and maintains it at 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), i.e. two or three degrees below the body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Higher temperatures affect [[spermatogenesis]]{{sfn|Van de Graaff|1989|p=936}}   Temperature control is accomplished by the [[smooth muscle]]s of the scrotum moving the testicles either closer to or further away from the abdomen dependent upon the ambient temperature. This is accomplished by the [[cremaster muscle]] in the abdomen and the [[dartos]] fascia (muscular tissue under the skin).{{sfn|Van de Graaff|1989|p=935}}\n\nHaving the scrotum and testicles situated outside the abdominal cavity may provide additional advantages. The external scrotum is not affected by abdominal pressure. This may prevent the emptying of the testes before the sperm were matured sufficiently for fertilization.{{sfn|Van de Graaff|1989|p=936}} Another advantage is it protects the testes from jolts and compressions associated with an active lifestyle. Animals that move at a steady pace \u2013 such as [[elephant]]s, [[whale]]s, and [[marsupial mole]]s \u2013 have internal testes and no scrotum.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15120432.000-science--bumpy-lifestyle-led-to-external-testes.html |title=Science : Bumpy lifestyle led to external testes - 17 August 1996 - New Scientist |accessdate=2007-11-06 |work=New Scientist}}</ref> Unlike placental mammals, some male [[marsupials]] have a scrotum that is anterior to the penis,<ref name=\"Tyndale-BiscoeRenfree1987\">{{cite book|author1=Hugh Tyndale-Biscoe|author2=Marilyn Renfree|title=Reproductive Physiology of Marsupials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpjovN0vXW4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=scrotum&f=false|date=30 January 1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-33792-2}}</ref><ref name=\"Hyman1992\">{{cite book|author=Libbie Henrietta Hyman|title=Hyman's Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKlWjdOkiMwC&pg=PA583#v=onepage&q=scrotum&f=false|date=15 September 1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-87013-7|pages=583\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"JonesDickman2003\">{{cite book|author1=Menna Jones|author2=Chris R.

The scrotal raphe is formed when the embryonic, urethral groove closes by week 12.{{sfn|Van de Graaff|1989|p=927-931}}\n\n===Scrotal growth and puberty=== \nThough the testes and scrotum form early in embryonic life, sexual maturation begins upon entering [[puberty]]. The increased secretion of testosterone causes the darkening of the skin and development of pubic hair on the scrotum.{{sfn|Van de Graaff|1989|p=935}}\n\n== Function ==\nThe scrotum regulates the temperature of the testes and maintains it at 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), i.e. two or three degrees below the body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Higher temperatures affect [[spermatogenesis]]{{sfn|Van de Graaff|1989|p=936}}   Temperature control is accomplished by the [[smooth muscle]]s of the scrotum moving the testicles either closer to or further away from the abdomen dependent upon the ambient temperature. This is accomplished by the [[cremaster muscle]] in the abdomen and the [[dartos]] fascia (muscular tissue under the skin).{{sfn|Van de Graaff|1989|p=935}}\n\nHaving the scrotum and testicles situated outside the abdominal cavity may provide additional advantages. The external scrotum is not affected by abdominal pressure. This may prevent the emptying of the testes before the sperm were matured sufficiently for fertilization.{{sfn|Van de Graaff|1989|p=936}} Another advantage is it protects the testes from jolts and compressions associated with an active lifestyle. Animals that move at a steady pace \u2013 such as [[elephant]]s, [[whale]]s, and [[marsupial mole]]s \u2013 have internal testes and no scrotum.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15120432.000-science--bumpy-lifestyle-led-to-external-testes.html |title=Science : Bumpy lifestyle led to external testes - 17 August 1996 - New Scientist |accessdate=2007-11-06 |work=New Scientist}}</ref> Unlike placental mammals, some male [[marsupials]] have a scrotum that is anterior to the penis,<ref name=\"Tyndale-BiscoeRenfree1987\">{{cite book|author1=Hugh Tyndale-Biscoe|author2=Marilyn Renfree|title=Reproductive Physiology of Marsupials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpjovN0vXW4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=scrotum&f=false|date=30 January 1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-33792-2}}</ref><ref name=\"Hyman1992\">{{cite book|author=Libbie Henrietta Hyman|title=Hyman's Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKlWjdOkiMwC&pg=PA583#v=onepage&q=scrotum&f=false|date=15 September 1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-87013-7|pages=583\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"JonesDickman2003\">{{cite book|author1=Menna Jones|author2=Chris R.

Improvements by Tatum led to the creation of the TCu380A ([[ParaGard]]), which is currently the preferred copper IUD.<ref name=Thiery1997 />\n\nThe hormonal IUD was also invented in the 1960s and 1970s; initially the goal was to mitigate the increased menstrual bleeding associated with copper and inert IUDs. The first model, Progestasert, was conceived of by Antonio Scommegna and created by Tapani J. V. Luukkainen, but the device only lasted for one year of use.<ref name=Thiery2000 /> Progestasert was manufactured until 2001.<ref name=\"medpundit\">{{cite web |last=Smith (pseudonym) |first=Sydney |title=Contraceptive Concerns |work=medpundit: Commentary on medical news by a practicing physician. |date= March 8, 2003 |url=http://www.medpundit.blogspot.com/2003_03_02_medpundit_archive.html |accessdate=2006-07-16 }}</ref> One commercial hormonal IUD which is currently available, Mirena, was also developed by Luukkainen and released in 1976.<ref name=Thiery1997 /> The manufacturer of the Mirena, [[Bayer AG]], became the target of multiple lawsuits over allegations that Bayer failed to adequately warn users that the IUD could pierce the uterus and migrate to other parts of the body.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2013/05_-_May/Judge_calls_for_female_lawyers_on_plaintiffs__committee_in_Mirena_MDL/ | title=Legal Current Events &#124; Westlaw Practitioner Insights}}</ref>\n\n===China===\nIn [[Mainland China|China]], the use of IUDs by state health services was part of the government's efforts to limit birth rates. From 1980 to 2014, 324 million women were inserted with IUDs, in addition to the 107 million who had [[tubal ligation]]. Women who refused could lose their government employment and their children could lose access to [[State school|public schools]].

Tory was accompanied by several mainstream media outlets as well as [[NewsTalk1010]] which he currently has a partnership with.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nTory asked Niko Salassidis a few simple questions, such as what he intends to accomplish. In response Niko mentioned how he wishes to stimulate awareness of the fraudulent nature of the [[fractional reserve banking]] system which Bank of Canada currently operates under, alongside how this method of banking has entrenched the monetary system as a whole.

His answer was \"My main advice is stick to your guns. When people say, 'You don't have a solution,' say, 'Of course we don't. If there was a solution, don't you think people would be doing it?' To ask the people who occupy Wall Street or Bay Street to have a full answer is absurd. They're doing their job which is to say, 'If you think this [system] is working for everyone, it's not.' Now they have to figure out how not to get captured by special interest and keep the pressure on.

No problem because it's true. But if it becomes a [[Marxist]] whine-fest or a [[Black Bloc]] gang spoiling for a violent fight with the cops, there will not be much tolerance and acceptance from Torontonians who even though they sometimes scold their cops, still respect, appreciate and love them.\"\n\nOn November 11, ''[[The Toronto Star]]'' [[columnist]] David Olive wrote: \"Certainly, this is the hour of our discontent.

Tory was accompanied by several mainstream media outlets as well as [[NewsTalk1010]] which he currently has a partnership with.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nTory asked Niko Salassidis a few simple questions, such as what he intends to accomplish. In response Niko mentioned how he wishes to stimulate awareness of the fraudulent nature of the [[fractional reserve banking]] system which Bank of Canada currently operates under, alongside how this method of banking has entrenched the monetary system as a whole.

His answer was \"My main advice is stick to your guns. When people say, 'You don't have a solution,' say, 'Of course we don't. If there was a solution, don't you think people would be doing it?' To ask the people who occupy Wall Street or Bay Street to have a full answer is absurd. They're doing their job which is to say, 'If you think this [system] is working for everyone, it's not.' Now they have to figure out how not to get captured by special interest and keep the pressure on.

No problem because it's true. But if it becomes a [[Marxist]] whine-fest or a [[Black Bloc]] gang spoiling for a violent fight with the cops, there will not be much tolerance and acceptance from Torontonians who even though they sometimes scold their cops, still respect, appreciate and love them.\"\n\nOn November 11, ''[[The Toronto Star]]'' [[columnist]] David Olive wrote: \"Certainly, this is the hour of our discontent.

They also benefited from foreign trade advantages that sets them apart from other countries, most significantly economic support from the United States; part of this is manifested in the proliferation of American electronic products in common households of the Four Tigers.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, levels in physical and [[human capital]] in the four economies far exceeded other countries at similar levels of development. This subsequently led to a rapid growth in [[per capita income]] levels. While high investments were essential to their economic growth, the role of human capital was also important. Education in particular is cited as playing a major role in the Asian economic miracle. The levels of education enrollment in the Four Asian Tigers were higher than predicted given their level of income. By 1965, all four nations had achieved universal [[primary education]].<ref name=\"Page 1994\"/> South Korea in particular had achieved a secondary education enrollment rate of 88% by 1987.<ref name=\"Page 1994\"/> There was also a notable decrease in the gap between male and female enrollments during the Asian miracle. Overall these advances in education allowed for high levels of literacy and cognitive skills.\n\n[[File:Worlds regions by total wealth(in trillions USD), 2018.jpg|thumb|250px|Worlds regions by total [[wealth]] (in trillions USD), 2018]]\nThe creation of stable [[macroeconomic]] environments was the foundation upon which the Asian miracle was built. Each of the Four Asian Tiger states managed, to various degrees of success, three variables in: [[budget deficits]], [[external debt]] and [[exchange rates]]. Each Tiger nation's budget deficits were kept within the limits of their financial limits, as to not destabilize the macro-economy. South Korea in particular had deficits lower than the [[OECD]] average in the 1980s. External debt was non-existent for Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, as they did not borrow from abroad.<ref name=\"Page 1994\"/> Although South Korea was the exception to this - its debt to GNP ratio was quite high during the period 1980-1985, it was sustained by the country\u2019s high level of exports. Exchange rates in the Four Asian Tiger nations had been changed from long-term fixed rate regimes to fixed-but-adjustable rate regimes with the occasional steep devaluation of managed floating rate regimes.<ref name=\"Page 1994\"/> This active exchange rate management allowed the Four Tiger economies to avoid exchange rate appreciation and maintain a stable real exchange rate.\n\nExport policies have been the de facto reason for the rise of these Four Asian Tiger economies. The approach taken has been different among the four nations. Hong Kong, and Singapore introduced trade regimes that were neoliberal in nature and encouraged free trade, while South Korea and Taiwan adopted mixed regimes that accommodated their own export industries. In Hong Kong and Singapore, due to small domestic markets, domestic prices were linked to international prices. South Korea and Taiwan introduced export incentives for the traded-goods sector. The governments of Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also worked to promote specific exporting industries, which were termed as an export push strategy. All these policies helped these four nations to achieve a growth averaging 7.5% each year for three decades and as such they achieved [[developed country]] status.<ref name=\"Economist 2009\">{{Cite journal\n  |title=Troubled Tigers\n  |year=2009\n  |journal=The Economist\n  |volume=390\n  |issue=8616\n  |pages=75\u201377\n  |url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2009/01/29/troubled-tigers\n  |author=Anonymous\n  |access-date=6 September 2018\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122141754/https://www.economist.com/briefing/2009/01/29/troubled-tigers\n  |archive-date=22 November 2018\n  |url-status=live\n  }}</ref>\n\nDani Rodrik, economist at the John F.

Hong Kong came under intense speculative attacks against its stock market and currency necessitating unprecedented market interventions by the state [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]].

By the fourth quarter of 2008, the [[GDP]] of all four nations fell by an average annualized rate of around 15%.<ref name=\"Economist 2009\"/>\nExports also fell by a 50% annualized rate.<ref name=\"Economist 2009\"/>\nWeak domestic demand also affected the recovery of these economies. In 2008, retail sales fell 3% in Hong Kong, 6% in Singapore and 11% in Taiwan.<ref name=\"Economist 2009\"/>\n\nAs the world recovered from the financial crisis, the Four Asian Tiger economies have also rebounded strongly. This is due in no small part to each country's government fiscal stimulus measures. These fiscal packages accounted for more than 4% of each country's GDP in 2009.<ref name=\"Economist 2009\"/>\nAnother reason for the strong bounce back is the modest corporate and household debt in these four nations.<ref name=\"Economist 2009\"/>\n\nA recent article published in ''Applied Economics Letters'' by financial economist Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich Business School and his international colleagues investigates the causal relationship between financial development and economic growth for [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]], [[India]] and Singapore for the period between 1979 and 2009, using [[Johansen cointegration test]]s and vector [[error correction model]]s. The results suggest that in the case of Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, China and India financial development leads to economic growth, whereas in the case of Thailand there exists a bidirectional causality between these variables. The results further suggest that in the case of Malaysia, financial development does not seem to cause economic growth.<ref>{{cite journal |surname1=Mukhopadhyaya |given1=Bidisha |surname2=Pradhana |given2=Rudra P. |surname3=Feridun |given3=Mete |year=2011 |title=Finance-growth nexus revisited for some Asian countries |journal=Applied Economics Letters |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1527\u20131530 |doi=10.1080/13504851.2010.548771}}</ref>\n\n== Gross domestic product (GDP) ==\nIn 2018, the combined economy of the Four Asian Tigers constituted 3.46% of the world's economy with a total [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product (GDP)]] of 2,932 billion US dollars.

Meanwhile, Taiwan and South Korea began to industrialize in the mid-1960s with heavy government involvement including initiatives and policies. Both countries pursued export-oriented industrialization as in Hong Kong and Singapore.<ref name=\"Hunt2003\">{{cite book|author=Michael H.

They also benefited from foreign trade advantages that sets them apart from other countries, most significantly economic support from the United States; part of this is manifested in the proliferation of American electronic products in common households of the Four Tigers.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, levels in physical and [[human capital]] in the four economies far exceeded other countries at similar levels of development. This subsequently led to a rapid growth in [[per capita income]] levels. While high investments were essential to their economic growth, the role of human capital was also important. Education in particular is cited as playing a major role in the Asian economic miracle. The levels of education enrollment in the Four Asian Tigers were higher than predicted given their level of income. By 1965, all four nations had achieved universal [[primary education]].<ref name=\"Page 1994\"/> South Korea in particular had achieved a secondary education enrollment rate of 88% by 1987.<ref name=\"Page 1994\"/> There was also a notable decrease in the gap between male and female enrollments during the Asian miracle. Overall these advances in education allowed for high levels of literacy and cognitive skills.\n\n[[File:Worlds regions by total wealth(in trillions USD), 2018.jpg|thumb|250px|Worlds regions by total [[wealth]] (in trillions USD), 2018]]\nThe creation of stable [[macroeconomic]] environments was the foundation upon which the Asian miracle was built. Each of the Four Asian Tiger states managed, to various degrees of success, three variables in: [[budget deficits]], [[external debt]] and [[exchange rates]]. Each Tiger nation's budget deficits were kept within the limits of their financial limits, as to not destabilize the macro-economy. South Korea in particular had deficits lower than the [[OECD]] average in the 1980s. External debt was non-existent for Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, as they did not borrow from abroad.<ref name=\"Page 1994\"/> Although South Korea was the exception to this - its debt to GNP ratio was quite high during the period 1980-1985, it was sustained by the country\u2019s high level of exports. Exchange rates in the Four Asian Tiger nations had been changed from long-term fixed rate regimes to fixed-but-adjustable rate regimes with the occasional steep devaluation of managed floating rate regimes.<ref name=\"Page 1994\"/> This active exchange rate management allowed the Four Tiger economies to avoid exchange rate appreciation and maintain a stable real exchange rate.\n\nExport policies have been the de facto reason for the rise of these Four Asian Tiger economies. The approach taken has been different among the four nations. Hong Kong, and Singapore introduced trade regimes that were neoliberal in nature and encouraged free trade, while South Korea and Taiwan adopted mixed regimes that accommodated their own export industries. In Hong Kong and Singapore, due to small domestic markets, domestic prices were linked to international prices. South Korea and Taiwan introduced export incentives for the traded-goods sector. The governments of Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also worked to promote specific exporting industries, which were termed as an export push strategy. All these policies helped these four nations to achieve a growth averaging 7.5% each year for three decades and as such they achieved [[developed country]] status.<ref name=\"Economist 2009\">{{Cite journal\n  |title=Troubled Tigers\n  |year=2009\n  |journal=The Economist\n  |volume=390\n  |issue=8616\n  |pages=75\u201377\n  |url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2009/01/29/troubled-tigers\n  |author=Anonymous\n  |access-date=6 September 2018\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122141754/https://www.economist.com/briefing/2009/01/29/troubled-tigers\n  |archive-date=22 November 2018\n  |url-status=live\n  }}</ref>\n\nDani Rodrik, economist at the John F.

Hong Kong came under intense speculative attacks against its stock market and currency necessitating unprecedented market interventions by the state [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]]. South Korea was hit the hardest as its foreign debt burdens swelled resulting in its currency falling between 35\u201350%.<ref name=\"Pam Woodall 1998 S3-S5\">{{Cite journal\n  |title=East Asian Economies: Tigers adrift\n  |journal=The Economist\n |year=1998\n  |publisher=The Economist Intelligence Unit\n  |location=London; US\n  |issn=0013-0613\n  |pages=S3\u2013S5\n  |author=Pam Woodall\n  |id={{ProQuest|224090151}}\n }}</ref> By the beginning of 1997, the stock market in Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea also saw losses of at least 60% in dollar terms.

The Four Asian Tigers recovered from the 1997 crisis faster than other countries due to various economic advantages including their high savings rate (except South Korea) and their openness to trade.<ref name=\"Pam Woodall 1998 S3-S5\"/>\n\n=== 2008 financial crisis ===\nThe export-oriented tiger economies, which benefited from American consumption, were hit hard by the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]]. By the fourth quarter of 2008, the [[GDP]] of all four nations fell by an average annualized rate of around 15%.<ref name=\"Economist 2009\"/>\nExports also fell by a 50% annualized rate.<ref name=\"Economist 2009\"/>\nWeak domestic demand also affected the recovery of these economies. In 2008, retail sales fell 3% in Hong Kong, 6% in Singapore and 11% in Taiwan.<ref name=\"Economist 2009\"/>\n\nAs the world recovered from the financial crisis, the Four Asian Tiger economies have also rebounded strongly. This is due in no small part to each country's government fiscal stimulus measures. These fiscal packages accounted for more than 4% of each country's GDP in 2009.<ref name=\"Economist 2009\"/>\nAnother reason for the strong bounce back is the modest corporate and household debt in these four nations.<ref name=\"Economist 2009\"/>\n\nA recent article published in ''Applied Economics Letters'' by financial economist Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich Business School and his international colleagues investigates the causal relationship between financial development and economic growth for [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]], [[India]] and Singapore for the period between 1979 and 2009, using [[Johansen cointegration test]]s and vector [[error correction model]]s. The results suggest that in the case of Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, China and India financial development leads to economic growth, whereas in the case of Thailand there exists a bidirectional causality between these variables. The results further suggest that in the case of Malaysia, financial development does not seem to cause economic growth.<ref>{{cite journal |surname1=Mukhopadhyaya |given1=Bidisha |surname2=Pradhana |given2=Rudra P. |surname3=Feridun |given3=Mete |year=2011 |title=Finance-growth nexus revisited for some Asian countries |journal=Applied Economics Letters |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1527\u20131530 |doi=10.1080/13504851.2010.548771}}</ref>\n\n== Gross domestic product (GDP) ==\nIn 2018, the combined economy of the Four Asian Tigers constituted 3.46% of the world's economy with a total [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product (GDP)]] of 2,932 billion US dollars.
