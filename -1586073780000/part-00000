It was opened in 1840, following the donation of the land by local philanthropist [[Joseph Strutt (philanthropist)|Joseph Strutt]], and to designs by [[John Claudius Loudon]]. It was the first publicly owned, landscaped, urban, recreational park in England. After many years of neglect, the Arboretum was extensively refurbished in the early 21st century with the aid of a [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] grant of almost \u00a35 million. It is listed as Grade II* on the [[English Heritage]] [[National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens|Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England]].<ref>[http://www.derby.gov.uk/Environment/Planning/builtheritage/HistoricParksandGardens.htm Arboretum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827200257/http://www.derby.gov.uk/Environment/Planning/builtheritage/HistoricParksandGardens.htm |date=27 August 2008 }}, Derby.gov.uk, accessed 30 November 2008</ref>\n\n==History==\nDerby Arboretum opened in 1840 and is often described as \"Britain's first public park\". Although green spaces and common lands had existed previously, as had private parkland and gardens, the park in Derby was the first to be deliberately planned as a place of public recreation in an urban setting.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wallop|first1=Harry|title=Britain's public parks: 175 years old, but will they survive?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/outdoors/11908169/Britains-public-parks-175-years-old-but-will-they-survive.html|accessdate=11 October 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=3 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kirby|first1=Dean|title=Derby Arboretum: How Britain's first public park inspired open spaces around the world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/derby-arboretum-how-britains-first-public-park-inspired-open-spaces-around-the-world-10478207.html|accessdate=11 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Arboretum was donated to the town in 1840 by [[Joseph Strutt (philanthropist)|Joseph Strutt]], a former [[mayor of Derby]] and member of a prominent local family of industrialists. A noted philanthropist, Strutt was grateful to the working people of Derby for the part they had played in helping him and his family amass their fortune, and wanted to convey his thanks by providing a much needed recreational facility for a rapidly expanding and urbanising area. Strutt commissioned [[John Claudius Loudon]] to design the park, and Loudon adapted Strutt's original plans for a [[botanical garden]] and pleasure grounds to his own vision, incorporating landscaped walkways.\n\nWork on the Arboretum commenced in July 1839, and was completed in time for the grand opening which took place on 16 September 1840. The occasion was marked by a parade from the Market Place in the centre of Derby to the new park. The park initially charged for admission, in order to pay for its upkeep. However, admission was free on Sundays and on Wednesdays (which had been adopted as half day closing in Derby). This meant that the working classes, who had limited leisure time and probably lacked the means to pay admission, could gain free access to the Arboretum when they actually had the time to do so; in effect, the park was paid for by those who had time and money to spare to enjoy the facilities. Free admission times continued to be extended until charging was finally abolished in 1882.\n\nIn 1859 the Arboretum was one of a number of parks visited by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] while on a research tour of Europe, and it is thought that he may have incorporated features of Loudon's work into his design for [[Central Park]] in New York.\n\nA scene from [[Ken Russell]]'s 1969 Oscar-winning film ''[[Women in Love (film)|Women in Love]]'' was shot at the Arboretum. The scene had a brass band playing on the Aslin-designed bandstand whilst [[Oliver Reed]], [[Alan Bates]] and [[Glenda Jackson]] acted in front of it. The Easter Pavilion had received a coat of paint for the occasion; this was the last work on the building until 2005 when it was fully restored.\n\n== Notable landmarks ==\n[[File:The fountain in the Derby Arboretum - geograph.org.uk - 1101279.jpg|thumb|alt=Fountain surrounded by railing|The Arboretum's fountain, designed by [[Andrew Handyside and Company|Andrew Handyside]]]]\nOver the years the Arboretum has incorporated a variety of buildings, statues and ornaments. Perhaps the best known locally is the ''[[Porcellino|Florentine Boar]]'' statue, which was originally placed on the site in 1806, when the land was Joseph Strutt's private garden.

It was opened in 1840, following the donation of the land by local philanthropist [[Joseph Strutt (philanthropist)|Joseph Strutt]], and to designs by [[John Claudius Loudon]]. It was the first publicly owned, landscaped, urban, recreational park in England. After many years of neglect, the Arboretum was extensively refurbished in the early 21st century with the aid of a [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] grant of almost \u00a35 million. It is listed as Grade II* on the [[English Heritage]] [[National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens|Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England]].<ref>[http://www.derby.gov.uk/Environment/Planning/builtheritage/HistoricParksandGardens.htm Arboretum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827200257/http://www.derby.gov.uk/Environment/Planning/builtheritage/HistoricParksandGardens.htm |date=27 August 2008 }}, Derby.gov.uk, accessed 30 November 2008</ref>\n\n==History==\nDerby Arboretum opened in 1840 and is often described as \"Britain's first public park\". Although green spaces and common lands had existed previously, as had private parkland and gardens, the park in Derby was the first to be deliberately planned as a place of public recreation in an urban setting.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wallop|first1=Harry|title=Britain's public parks: 175 years old, but will they survive?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/outdoors/11908169/Britains-public-parks-175-years-old-but-will-they-survive.html|accessdate=11 October 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=3 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kirby|first1=Dean|title=Derby Arboretum: How Britain's first public park inspired open spaces around the world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/derby-arboretum-how-britains-first-public-park-inspired-open-spaces-around-the-world-10478207.html|accessdate=11 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Arboretum was donated to the town in 1840 by [[Joseph Strutt (philanthropist)|Joseph Strutt]], a former [[mayor of Derby]] and member of a prominent local family of industrialists. A noted philanthropist, Strutt was grateful to the working people of Derby for the part they had played in helping him and his family amass their fortune, and wanted to convey his thanks by providing a much needed recreational facility for a rapidly expanding and urbanising area. Strutt commissioned [[John Claudius Loudon]] to design the park, and Loudon adapted Strutt's original plans for a [[botanical garden]] and pleasure grounds to his own vision, incorporating landscaped walkways.\n\nWork on the Arboretum commenced in July 1839, and was completed in time for the grand opening which took place on 16 September 1840. The occasion was marked by a parade from the Market Place in the centre of Derby to the new park. The park initially charged for admission, in order to pay for its upkeep. However, admission was free on Sundays and on Wednesdays (which had been adopted as half day closing in Derby). This mean that the working classes, who had limited leisure time and probably lacked the means to pay admission, could gain free access to the Arboretum when they actually had the time to do so; in effect, the park was paid for by those who had time and money to spare to enjoy the facilities. Free admission times continued to be extended until charging was finally abolished in 1882.\n\nIn 1859 the Arboretum was one of a number of parks visited by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] while on a research tour of Europe, and it is thought that he may have incorporated features of Loudon's work into his design for [[Central Park]] in New York.\n\nA scene from [[Ken Russell]]'s 1969 Oscar-winning film ''[[Women in Love (film)|Women in Love]]'' was shot at the Arboretum. The scene had a brass band playing on the Aslin-designed bandstand whilst [[Oliver Reed]], [[Alan Bates]] and [[Glenda Jackson]] acted in front of it. The Easter Pavilion had received a coat of paint for the occasion; this was the last work on the building until 2005 when it was fully restored.\n\n== Notable landmarks ==\n[[File:The fountain in the Derby Arboretum - geograph.org.uk - 1101279.jpg|thumb|alt=Fountain surrounded by railing|The Arboretum's fountain, designed by [[Andrew Handyside and Company|Andrew Handyside]]]]\nOver the years the Arboretum has incorporated a variety of buildings, statues and ornaments. Perhaps the best known locally is the ''[[Porcellino|Florentine Boar]]'' statue, which was originally placed on the site in 1806, when the land was Joseph Strutt's private garden. Strutt had commissioned [[w. J. Coffee|William John Coffee]], a [[Crown Derby]] sculptor, to make an earthenware copy of the bronze statue which he had seen when he once visited the Mercato Nuovo (New Market) in central [[Florence]].

Billy Nichols returned in the 2003 novel ''Shadow Boxer''.\n\n== Books ==\n\n===Nonfiction===\n*(with Daniel Faris) ''Grindhouse: The Forbidden World of \"Adults Only\" Cinema'' (1996); {{ISBN|0-312-14609-4}}\n*''Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir'' (1998); {{ISBN|0-312-18076-4}}\n*''Dark City Dames: The Wicked Women of Film Noir'' (2001); {{ISBN|0-06-039369-6}}\n*''The Art Of Noir: The Posters & Graphics From The Classical Era Of Film Noir'' (2004); {{ISBN|1-58567-603-9}}\n*(with [[Tab Hunter]]) ''Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star'' (2005); {{ISBN|1-56512-548-7}}\n\n===Fiction===\n*''The Distance'' (2002); {{ISBN|0-7432-1443-9}}\n*''Shadow Boxer'' (2003); {{ISBN|0-7432-1444-7}}\n\n==DVD commentaries==\n*''[[99 River Street]]''\n*''[[Angel Face (1952 film)|Angel Face]]''\n*''[[The Big Combo]]''\n*''[[Born to Kill (1947 film)|Born to Kill]]'', with audio interview excerpts of director [[Robert Wise]]\n*''[[Crime Wave (1954 film)|Crime Wave]]'', with crime novelist [[James Ellroy]]\n*''[[Fallen Angel (1945 film)|Fallen Angel]]'', with Susan Andrews (daughter of actor [[Dana Andrews]])\n*''[[Gilda]]''\n*''[[The House on 92nd Street]]''\n*''[[The House on Telegraph Hill]]''\n*''[[I Wake Up Screaming]]''\n*''[[The Lineup (film)|The Lineup]]'', with crime novelist [[James Ellroy]]\n*''[[Macao (film)|Macao]]'', with screenwriter Stanley Rubin and actress [[Jane Russell]]\n*''[[Mau Mau Sex Sex]]'', with director Ted Bonnitt\n*''[[No Way Out (1950 film)|No Way Out]]''\n*''[[The Racket (1951 film)|The Racket]]''\n*''[[Road House (1948 film)|Road House]]'', with film noir historian Kim Morgan\n*''[[The Prowler (1951 film)|The Prowler]]''\n*''[[The Sniper (1952 film)|The Sniper]]''\n*''[[Somewhere in the Night (film)|Somewhere in the Night]]''\n*''[[They Live by Night]]'', with actor [[Farley Granger]]\n*''[[Where the Sidewalk Ends (film)|Where the Sidewalk Ends]]''\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.eddiemuller.com/ Official web site]\n*[http://www.noircity.com/foundation.html Film Noir Foundation]\n*{{IMDb name|0612113}}\n*[http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/68/68mulleriv.php Interview with Matthew Sorrento at ''Bright Lights Film Journal'']\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Muller, Eddie}}\n[[Category:American film historians]]\n[[Category:American male non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Film theorists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:American film critics]]\n[[Category:Shamus Award winners]]\n", "name_user": "Anfrench", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added March 2020 interview on Screen Comment", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Muller"}
