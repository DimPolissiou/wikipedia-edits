The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). The Gendarmerie were involved in fighting the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) in Northern Katanga at the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1960. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Rum Punch]] (August 1961), [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961) and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1963). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

Approximately 5,000 troops were earmarked for the operation, which focused on a northward offensive from Lubudi. At the same time, they were to recapture the town of [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], secure the area south of it, and launch attacks on [[Kabalo]] from [[Kalemie|Albertville]] to the east and [[Kongolo, Tanganyika|Kongolo]] to the north.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}} The Katangese Genarmerie subsequently launched operations Banquise, Mambo, and Lotus against the BALUBAKAT rebels.

Such efforts largely failed.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=50}}\n\nAfter being pressured by the United States and United Nations, Belgium removed many of its forces from the region from August to September 1961. However, many officers remained, without official Belgian support, or became mercenaries. To support these efforts, Belgium organized hundreds of Europeans to fight with Katanga. There had also been ongoing efforts by the United Nations to suppress Belgian support to the Gendarmerie; 338 mercenaries and 443 political advisers were expelled from the region by August. That same month, war veterans were first [[Military awards and decorations|honored]]. Dead soldiers were also remembered in ceremonies at the [[Sts.

UMHK officials privately told Tshombe they were withdrawing their support for succession.<ref name=\"othen\" /> General Moke vainly attempted to organise the 140 mercenaries and 2,000 gendarmes under his command to prepare a final defence of Kolwezi. His efforts, undermined by the force's low morale and indiscipline, were further hampered by an influx of refugees. Discipline in the garrison increasingly faltered; in once instance, two mercenaries attempted to steal Puren's jeep. Tshombe ordered the Katangese garrison of [[Baudouinville]] to surrender to besieging UN and ANC forces. Instead, they and most of the population deserted the city while a handful of gendarmes near [[Kongolo, Katanga|Kongolo]] laid down their arms to Nigerian and Malaysian soldiers. On 14 January, Indian troops found the last intact bridge into Kolwezi. After a brief fight with gendarmes and mercenaries they secured it and crossed over, stopping at the city outskirts to await further instruction.<ref name=\"othen\" /> At a final meeting with his mercenary commanders, Tshombe ordered all remaining Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. [[Jean Schramme]] was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate what remained of the Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January.<ref name=\"othen\" />\n\nOn 15 January, Tshombe sent a formal message to Thant, \"I am ready to proclaim immediately before the world that the Katanga's secession is ended.\"{{sfn|Meisler|2011|p=133}} He offered to return to \u00c9lisabethville to oversee the implementation of Thant's proposal for reunification if Prime Minister Adoula granted amnesty to himself and his government.

On 8 February 1963, General Moke and several of his officers pledged their allegiance to President Kasa-Vubu.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} However, of the estimated 14,000-17,000 gendarmes, only 3,500 registered for integration, and only around 2,000-3,000 became part of the ANC. Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963. The ANC began raiding pro-secession communities, as gendarmes continued to roam North Rhodesia, Angola and Katanga.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nThroughout 1963 gendarmes steadily crossed into Angola. Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in \"refugee\" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from [[Southern Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} Around April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=68}} Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the Kwilu and Simba rebels.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=69}} They were used successfully against the insurgencies, and, following Tshombe's ousting from power, they retained significant political distance from Mobutu's regime. Relations between the two parties quickly worsened, culminating in [[Stanleyville mutinies|a bloody mutiny]] in July 1966.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}}\n\nA March 1967 trial of Tshombe ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' criminalized the actions of the gendarmes retrospectively. After the trial, the gendarmes were referred to as 'mercenaries' by Congolese press. A [[Stanleyville mutinies#Second mutiny|second wave of mutinies]] broke out on July 5, 1967 in [[Bukavu]] and [[Kisangani]], after Tshombe's plane was hijacked and he was detained in [[Algiers]]. The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes, led by Belgian mercenary [[Jean Schramme]] were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes. They reached Bukavu, and a secessionist state was declared.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=|pp=77-78}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tanner|first=Henry|url=|title=Congo: The Revolt That Failed|date=July 23, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A plan was proposed by the [[International Red Cross]] to evacuate 950 gendarmes and around 650 of their dependents to [[Zambia]]. Schramme and Mobutu objected, and the plan did not go forward. Tough the ANC continued fighting, around 900 gendarmes gave up their arms and crossed into Rwanda. At the end of the mutinies, the gendarmes agreed to a cease-fire proposed by [[Diallo Telli]] under which they could gain amnesty by returning to the Congo.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). The Gendarmerie were involved in fighting the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) in Northern Katanga at the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1960. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Rum Punch]] (August 1961), [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961) and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1963). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

Approximately 5,000 troops were earmarked for the operation, which focused on a northward offensive from Lubudi. At the same time, they were to recapture the town of [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], secure the area south of it, and launch attacks on [[Kabalo]] from [[Kalemie|Albertville]] to the east and [[Kongolo, Tanganyika|Kongolo]] to the north.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}} The Katangese Genarmerie subsequently launched operations Banquise, Mambo, and Lotus against the BALUBAKAT rebels.

Annoyed that Babe and Kenzie are not focusing on the game, Triple G confronts them but ends up being drawn into the marathon. Eventually, Hudson, Double G, Ruthless, and Bunny are all watching the marathon as well and everyone forgets about their priorities, such as Double G missing a concert that he had scheduled. Babe and Kenzie end up staying up all night watching the marathon while everyone else falls asleep. When morning comes, the ''Game Shakers'' want to find out whether Freddie was in love with Carly or Sam, but an argument breaks out; Babe believes it was Carly, while Kenzie believes it was Sam. Triple G discovers that [[Nathan Kress]], who portrayed Freddie, is staying at the Four Stevens Hotel in New York. Babe and Kenzie are determined to settle their argument by meeting the actor in his hotel room, but when they cannot get past the front desk, Triple G disguises Hudson as Nathan to obtain the room key. While it gets the ''Game Shakers'' into Nathan's room, Nathan catches them and is on the phone with security.

Kenzie takes a job at the Coffee Shop that the gang was hanging out temporally while their regular hangout was getting remodel. Trip convinces Kenzie to talk with Babe and work out their disagreement. However, Kenzie feels more unwanted at ''Game Shakers'' when Babe replaces her, temporally. Double G helped Babe realize why Kenzie got upset with her and decided to make things right with her. Babe dresses up at Kenzie at her job to get her fired then defends her when her ex-boss insulted her. Kenzie accepts Babe standing up for her as an apology despite the fight between them being more of her fault for overreacting and blaming Babe for something she didn't do. Kenzie and Babe end their break from each other. Meanwhile, Double G stole his brother Chimp just to get money back from him.

Babe and Kenzie end up staying up all night watching the marathon while everyone else falls asleep. When morning comes, the ''Game Shakers'' want to find out whether Freddie was in love with Carly or Sam, but an argument breaks out; Babe believes it was Carly, while Kenzie believes it was Sam. Triple G discovers that [[Nathan Kress]], who portrayed Freddie, is staying at the Four Stevens Hotel in New York. Babe and Kenzie are determined to settle their argument by meeting the actor in his hotel room, but when they cannot get past the front desk, Triple G disguises Hudson as Nathan to obtain the room key. While it gets the ''Game Shakers'' into Nathan's room, Nathan catches them and is on the phone with security. The ''Game Shakers'' persuade him not to throw them out, then pose the question about whom Freddie was in love with. Since Nathan only portrayed the character, he is unable to give them an answer, leading them to ask for his personal opinion on the matter instead.

Meanwhile, Double G's pet pig Sebastian has died and Double G is very upset about it. He later holds a funeral for the pig, but it doesn't exactly go as planned when Babe and Kenzie are in a hurry to finish their dance moves. Babe and Kenzie continue working on their dance moves while at Sebastian's funeral, which annoys Double G. In order for Double G to stop being so sad, Triple G talked with Bobby Dong and had Sebastian turned into a drone, which is used to cause more chaos after Babe and Kenzie's project interrupted Sebastian's funeral.\n\n''Guest stars'': Shel Bailey as Ruthless, Bubba Ganter as Bunny, Roy Abramsohn as J.R., Shawn Law as B.J.\n| LineColor       = 98FB98\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 41\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 22\n| Title           = War and Peach\n| DirectedBy      = Russ Reinsel\n| WrittenBy       = Dan Schneider & Richard Goodman\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|10|14}}\n| ProdCode        = 214\n| Viewers         = 1.13<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-saturday-cable-originals-network-finals-10-14-2017.html|title=Top 150 Saturday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 10.14.2017|work=[[Showbuzz Daily]]|author=[[Mitch Metcalf]]|date=October 17, 2017|access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

On October 1, 1993, at the age of twelve, she was [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] at knife point during a [[slumber party]] at her mother's home in [[Petaluma, California]]. She was later strangled. [[Richard Allen Davis]] was convicted of her murder in 1996 and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/polly-smiling-killer-death-sentence-article-1.741066|title=Polly's Smiling Killer Gets Death Sentence|last=Kennedy|first=Helen|date=August 6, 1996|newspaper=The New York Daily News|accessdate=January 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nOn October 1, 1993, Polly Klaas and two friends were having a slumber party. Around 10:30pm, [[Richard Allen Davis]] entered their bedroom, carrying a knife. He tied both friends up, pulled pillowcases over their heads and told them to count to 1,000. He then kidnapped Klaas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollyklaas.org/about/pollys-story.html|title=Polly's Story|work=pollyklaas.org}}</ref>\n\nOver the next two months, about 4,000 people helped search for Klaas.<ref name=\"Mercury News\">{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Kevin|title=City nearly demolishes Polly Klaas bench in Pacific Grove \u2013 The Mercury News|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2011/09/15/city-nearly-demolishes-polly-klaas-bench-in-pacific-grove/|accessdate=April 24, 2017|work=MediaNews, Monterey County Herald|publisher=The Mercury News|date=August 13, 2016}}</ref> TV shows such as ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' and ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' covered the kidnapping. An APB ([[all-points bulletin]]) with the suspect's information was broadcast within 30 minutes of the kidnapping. The broadcast, however, only went out over Sonoma County Sheriff's Channel 1.\n\nIn a rural area of Santa Rosa, about 20 miles north of Petaluma, a babysitter on her way home noted a suspicious vehicle stuck in a ditch on her employer's private driveway. She phoned the property owner, who decided to leave with her daughter. As she drove down the long driveway to Pythian Road, the owner passed Davis. She called 911 when she got to a service station and two deputies were dispatched on the call. The deputies did not know of the kidnapping or the suspect's description, due to [[Sonoma Valley]] units being on Channel 3. The deputies ran Davis' driver's license and license plate number, but they came back with no wants or warrants. The deputies tried to convince the property owner to perform a [[citizen's arrest]] for trespassing. Under California law, a civilian may make an arrest for this type of misdemeanor. The property owner would have had to go to the car with the deputies and say \"I arrest you.\" The deputies then would have taken Davis into custody. The property owner refused.\n\nThe deputies called for a tow truck to get Davis' car out of the ditch. They searched it thoroughly before the arrival of the tow truck and did not find evidence of anyone else in the car. The only possible violation was an open container of beer, but Davis was not driving at the time of the deputies' contact and mere possession of an open container was not illegal. Before Davis was allowed to leave, he was instructed to pour out the beer and the deputies filled out an FI (Field Interrogation) card with his information and the FI card was filed.\n\nOn November 28, 1993, the property owner was inspecting her property after loggers had partially cleared the property of trees. She discovered items that made her think they might have matched those used in the kidnapping. She called the sheriff's department to report her discovery, and deputies and crime scene investigators were dispatched. One of the items found, a torn pair of ballet leggings, was matched by the FBI Crime Laboratory to the other part of the leggings that were taken as evidence on the night of the kidnapping. A review of calls in the area the day of the kidnapping turned up the contact with Davis, who had only been identified because both deputies had filled out and filed the FI card. Once the identity of Davis was revealed, his palm print at the scene of the kidnapping was also traced to him. Authorities had been unable to match the partial print earlier due to the poor quality of the print left.\n\nThe [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]] Sheriff's Department, in cooperation with Petaluma Police and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], launched a search of the property and the Pythian Road area during a heavy rainstorm. The first two days of the search were kept as low-key as possible, since Davis was under surveillance at an Indian rancheria near [[Ukiah, California]]. When nothing was found during the initial search and the surveillance of Davis also produced no results, the decision was made to arrest him for the kidnapping of Klaas.\n\nWhile Davis was being interrogated by Petaluma PD and the FBI, a massive search was launched on Friday, December 3. The Sonoma County Sheriff's Department was assisted by over 500 search team members from 24 agencies, coming from as far away as Kern County, California and Washoe County, Nevada. The mutual aid effort was coordinated by the California State Office of Emergency Services (now known as the [[California Governor's Office of Emergency Services]]), FBI Crime Scene teams and numerous other state and federal agencies. The search remains today as one of the largest ever conducted in California. The search continued through Saturday, December 4. The search effort produced other items of evidence, but did not produce any evidence of human remains. The search was planned to continue on Sunday, December 5, but on the evening of December 4, Davis confessed to kidnapping and murdering Klaas and led investigators to her body.<ref name=\"LA Times\">{{cite news|title=Graphic Testimony in Klaas Trial Forces Family Out of Court|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1996-05-07/news/mn-1395_1_family-klaas-trial|accessdate=April 24, 2017|work=Associated Press|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 7, 1996|location=San Jose, CA.}}</ref> He had buried her in a shallow grave just off Highway 101, about a mile south of the city limits of [[Cloverdale, California]]. The grave site is about 20 air miles and about 30 road miles from the search site.\n\nAlthough Davis admitted to strangling Klaas to death, he refused to give investigators a timeline of the events from October 1. Investigators thought he was fearful that both people who passed him would call the sheriff's department. It is believed that he killed her before the arrival of deputies and hid her body in the thick brush on the hillside above where his car was stuck. He then waited for an undetermined period of time after being escorted back to Highway 12, about 1.5 miles from where his car was stuck and drove back up to retrieve her body. He was reportedly out of breath, sweating profusely (despite being a cool night) and had twigs and leaves in his hair when contacted by deputies. It is also believed that he had chosen the grave site in advance, since it would not have been discovered by a casual observer. The gravesite area would be directly visible from Highway 101, but not the grave itself. He had to drive from the Indian Rancheria in Ukiah once a week to meet with his parole officer and he would have seen any police activity in the area.\n\n==Conviction==\nAfter a long, tumultuous trial, Davis was convicted on June 18, 1996, of first-degree murder and four special circumstances (robbery, burglary, kidnapping and a lewd act on a child) in Klaas' death.<ref name=townhall>{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/debrajsaunders/2009/03/12/richard_allen_davis_safe_on_death_row/page/full/|title=Richard Allen Davis: Safe on Death Row|work=townhall.com}}</ref> A [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] Superior Court jury returned a verdict of death.

The first two days of the search were kept as low-key as possible, since Davis was under surveillance at an Indian rancheria near [[Ukiah, California]]. When nothing was found during the initial search and the surveillance of Davis also produced no results, the decision was made to arrest him for the kidnapping of Klaas.\n\nWhile Davis was being interrogated by Petaluma PD and the FBI, a massive search was launched on Friday, December 3. The Sonoma County Sheriff's Department was assisted by over 500 search team members from 24 agencies, coming from as far away as Kern County, California and Washoe County, Nevada. The mutual aid effort was coordinated by the California State Office of Emergency Services (now known as the [[California Governor's Office of Emergency Services]]), FBI Crime Scene teams and numerous other state and federal agencies. The search remains today as one of the largest ever conducted in California. The search continued through Saturday, December 4. The search effort produced other items of evidence, but did not produce any evidence of human remains. The search was planned to continue on Sunday, December 5, but on the evening of December 4, Davis confessed to kidnapping and murdering Klaas and led investigators to her body.<ref name=\"LA Times\">{{cite news|title=Graphic Testimony in Klaas Trial Forces Family Out of Court|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1996-05-07/news/mn-1395_1_family-klaas-trial|accessdate=April 24, 2017|work=Associated Press|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 7, 1996|location=San Jose, CA.}}</ref> He had buried her in a shallow grave just off Highway 101, about a mile south of the city limits of [[Cloverdale, California]]. The grave site is about 20 air miles and about 30 road miles from the search site.\n\nAlthough Davis admitted to strangling Klaas to death, he refused to give investigators a timeline of the events from October 1. Investigators thought he was fearful that both people who passed him would call the sheriff's department. It is believed that he killed her before the arrival of deputies and hid her body in the thick brush on the hillside above where his car was stuck. He then waited for an undetermined period of time after being escorted back to Highway 12, about 1.5 miles from where his car was stuck and drove back up to retrieve her body. He was reportedly out of breath, sweating profusely (despite being a cool night) and had twigs and leaves in his hair when contacted by deputies. It is also believed that he had chosen the grave site in advance, since it would not have been discovered by a casual observer. The gravesite area would be directly visible from Highway 101, but not the grave itself. He had to drive from the Indian Rancheria in Ukiah once a week to meet with his parole officer and he would have seen any police activity in the area.\n\n==Conviction==\nAfter a long, tumultuous trial, Davis was convicted on June 18, 1996, of first-degree murder and four special circumstances (robbery, burglary, kidnapping and a lewd act on a child) in Klaas' death.<ref name=townhall>{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/debrajsaunders/2009/03/12/richard_allen_davis_safe_on_death_row/page/full/|title=Richard Allen Davis: Safe on Death Row|work=townhall.com}}</ref> A [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] Superior Court jury returned a verdict of death.

Her husband, who was her legal guardian, and the medical team wanted to remove her feeding tube, as she was in a \"persistent vegetative state\" with no hope of improvement. Her parents opposed this decision for years, appealing to courts, Congress, and ultimately to President George W. Bush to intervene. Wasserman Schultz was one of the strongest opponents of congressional intervention in what she believed should be a private family decision.

Bush]] of hypocrisy for having signed a 1999 bill as Governor of [[Texas]] that allows [[health care]] workers to remove [[life support]] for terminally ill patients if the patient or family is unable to pay the medical bills. During the debate, Wasserman Schultz pointed out that a Texas law signed by Gov. Bush allowed caregivers to withhold treatment \"at the point that futility has been reached and there is no longer any hope of survival or of additional health care measures being used to sustain life.&nbsp;... [this] seems to conflict with his position today.\" [[Cox News Service]] reported that \"The Texas law was intended to control in cases in which medical teams and patients' representatives disagree on treatment.

Bush]]'s proposals to give financial aid to the [[Palestinian Authority]] in both the proposed supplemental and in the 2006 budgets. She said:\n\n<blockquote>We want to continue to focus on making sure that&nbsp;... the policy coming from Washington continues to encourage and support and nurture the peace process. In [Bush's] first four years, there was a lack of leadership coming from the administration. I know many people in the Jewish community were happy with the president's position on Israel, but the way I thought, there was an absence of leadership.&nbsp; ...

The very far right group of Republicans' interest in Israel is not because they are so supportive of there being a Jewish state and making sure that Jews have a place that we can call home. It has references to [[Armageddon]] and biblical references that are more their interest. So I would encourage members of the Jewish community to put their faith in Democrats, because our support for Israel is generally for the right reasons.<ref name=\"Forward\"/></blockquote>\n\nWasserman Schultz supported Israel in the [[2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict]] and criticized MSNBC's coverage of the conflict.

Her husband, who was her legal guardian, and the medical team wanted to remove her feeding tube, as she was in a \"persistent vegetative state\" with no hope of improvement. Her parents opposed this decision for years, appealing to courts, Congress, and ultimately to President George W. Bush to intervene. Wasserman Schultz was one of the strongest opponents of congressional intervention in what she believed should be a private family decision.

Bush]] of hypocrisy for having signed a 1999 bill as Governor of [[Texas]] that allows [[health care]] workers to remove [[life support]] for terminally ill patients if the patient or family is unable to pay the medical bills. During the debate, Wasserman Schultz pointed out that a Texas law signed by Gov. Bush allowed caregivers to withhold treatment \"at the point that futility has been reached and there is no longer any hope of survival or of additional health care measures being used to sustain life.&nbsp;... [this] seems to conflict with his position today.\" [[Cox News Service]] reported that \"The Texas law was intended to control in cases in which medical teams and patients' representatives disagree on treatment.

Bush]]'s proposals to give financial aid to the [[Palestinian Authority]] in both the proposed supplemental and in the 2006 budgets. She said:\n\n<blockquote>We want to continue to focus on making sure that&nbsp;... the policy coming from Washington continues to encourage and support and nurture the peace process. In [Bush's] first four years, there was a lack of leadership coming from the administration. I know many people in the Jewish community were happy with the president's position on Israel, but the way I thought, there was an absence of leadership.&nbsp; ...

The very far right group of Republicans' interest in Israel is not because they are so supportive of there being a Jewish state and making sure that Jews have a place that we can call home. It has references to [[Armageddon]] and biblical references that are more their interest. So I would encourage members of the Jewish community to put their faith in Democrats, because our support for Israel is generally for the right reasons.<ref name=\"Forward\"/></blockquote>\n\nWasserman Schultz supported Israel in the [[2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict]] and criticized MSNBC's coverage of the conflict.

When the main body of the church was forced out of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], Illinois, in the winter of 1846, the church attempted to sell the building, finally succeeding in 1848.  The building was damaged by fire and a tornado before being demolished.\n\nIn 1937, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) reacquired the lot on which the original temple had stood. In 2000, the church began to build a temple on the original site whose exterior is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern [[Temple (LDS Church)|Latter-day Saint temple]].  On June 27, 2002, a date that coincided with the 158th anniversary of the [[Death of Joseph Smith|death]] of [[Joseph Smith|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith]], the temple was dedicated by the LDS Church as the [[Nauvoo Illinois Temple]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:NauvooTemple.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Rendition of the Nauvoo Temple published in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's Monthly]]'']]\nThe Latter Day Saints made preparations to build a temple soon after establishing their headquarters at [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], Illinois, in 1839.  On April 6, 1841, the temple's cornerstone was laid under the direction of [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and [[Sidney Rigdon]] gave the principal oration.  At its base the building was {{convert|128|ft|m}} long and {{convert|88|ft|m}} wide with a [[clock tower]] and [[weather vane]] reaching to  a total height of {{convert|165|ft|m}}&mdash;a 60% increase over the dimensions of the Kirtland Temple.  Like Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts.  Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple had a full basement which housed a [[Baptism for the dead|baptismal font]]. Because the Saints had to abandon Nauvoo, the building was not entirely completed. The basement with its font was finished, as were the first floor assembly hall and the attic. When these parts of the building were completed they were used for performing ordinances (basement and attic) or for worship services (first floor assembly hall).\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple Sunstone 2003.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A Sunstone from the original Nauvoo Temple in a case in front of LDS Church's Visitor Center in Nauvoo]]\nThe Nauvoo Temple was designed in the [[Greek Revival]] style by architect [[William Weeks]], under the direction of Joseph Smith. Weeks' design made use of distinctively Latter Day Saint motifs, including Sunstones, Moonstones, and Starstones. It is often mistakenly thought that these stones represent the Three [[Degrees of Glory]] in the Latter Day Saint conception of the afterlife, but the stones appear in the wrong order. Instead, Wandle Mace, foreman for the framework of the Nauvoo Temple, has explained that the design of the temple was meant to be \"a representation of the Church, the Bride, the Lamb's wife\" (Wandle Mace, Autobiography 207 (BYU Special Collections)). In this regard Mace references John's statement in Revelation 12:1 concerning the \"woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.\" This explains why the Starstones are at the top of the temple (\"crown of twelve stars\"), the Sunstones in the middle (\"clothed with the sun\") and the Moonstones at the bottom (\"moon under her feet\").\n\nConstruction was only half complete at the [[Death of Joseph Smith]] in 1844.  After a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]], [[Brigham Young]] was sustained as the church's leader by the majority of Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo.  As [[mob violence]] increased during the summer of 1845, he encouraged the Latter Day Saints to complete the temple even as they prepared to abandon the city, so portions of it could be used for Latter Day Saint [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]], such as [[Baptism for the dead|baptisms for the dead]] in the basement font. During the winter of 1845-46, the temple began to be used for additional ordinances, including the Nauvoo-era [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]], [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealings]] in marriage, and [[Law of adoption (Latter Day Saints)|adoptions]]. The Nauvoo Temple was in use for less than three months.\n\nMost of the Latter Day Saints left Nauvoo, beginning in February 1846, but a small crew remained to finish the temple's first floor, so that it could be formally dedicated.  Once the first floor was finished with pulpits and benches, the building was finally dedicated in private services on April 30, 1846, and in public services on 1 May.  In September 1846 the remaining Latter Day Saints were driven from the city and [[vigilantes]] from the neighboring region, including [[Carthage, Illinois]], entered the near-empty city and vandalized the temple.\n\nInitially the church's agents tried to lease the structure, first to the [[Catholic Church]], and then to private individuals. When this failed, they attempted to sell the temple, asking up to $200,000, but this effort also met with no success. On March 11, 1848, the LDS Church's agents sold the building to David T. LeBaron, for $5,000. Finally, the New York Home Missionary Society expressed interest in leasing the building as a school, but around midnight on October 8\u20139, 1848, the temple was set on fire by an unknown arsonist.  Nauvoo's residents attempted to put out the fire, but the temple was gutted.  [[James J. Strang]], leader of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)|Strangite faction]] of Latter Day Saints, accused Young's agents of setting fire to the temple.  However, Strang's charges were never proven. On April 2, 1849, LeBaron sold the damaged temple to [[\u00c9tienne Cabet]] for $2,000. Cabet, whose followers were called [[Icarians]], hoped to establish Nauvoo as a [[communism|communistic]] [[utopia]].<ref name=chronology>{{cite web |title=Chronology of the Construction, Destruction, and Reconstruction of the Nauvoo Temple |url=http://users.marshall.edu/~brown/nauvoo/chrono.html |date=February 2000 |author=Brown, Lisle G. |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction ===\n[[File:Nauvootemplefirecca.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Nauvoo Temple burning]]\nAfter the fire of October 9, 1848, only the four exterior walls remained standing.<ref>{{citation |last1= Harrington |first1= Virginia S. |last2= Harrington |first2= J.C. |author2-link= J.C.

However, on May 27, 1850, Nauvoo was struck by a major tornado which toppled one of the walls of the temple.  One source claimed the storm seemed to \"single out the Temple\", felling \"the walls with a roar that was heard miles away\".<ref>{{citation |last1= Horner |first1= Henry |year= 1939 |title= Illinois, A Descriptive and Historical Guide |place= Chicago |publisher= Federal Writer's Project of the Work Projects Administration for the State of Illinois |page= 352 }}</ref>  Cabet ordered the demolition of two more walls in the interests of public safety, leaving only the fa\u00e7ade standing. The Icarians used much of the temple's stone to build a new school building on the southwest corner of the temple lot. By 1857, however, most of Cabet's followers had left Nauvoo and over time many of the original stones for the temple were used in the construction of other buildings throughout [[Hancock County, Illinois|Hancock County]]. In February 1865, Nauvoo's City Council ordered the final demolition of the last standing portion of the temple&mdash;one lone corner of the fa\u00e7ade. Soon afterwards, all evidence of the temple disappeared, except for a hand pump over a well that supplied water to the baptismal font.<ref name=chronology/>  Three of the original sunstones are known to have survived and are on display&mdash;one is on loan to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Visitor Center in Nauvoo, one is in the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C, and the third and only one that has not been restored is displayed, along with the only moonstone on display, at the Joseph Smith Historic Center of the [[Community of Christ]].\n{{-}}\n{{multiple image | caption_align=center| header_align=center | header = Reconstructed [[Nauvoo Illinois Temple|LDS Nauvoo Illinois Temple]], dedicated 2002 | align = right | direction = horizontal | total_width = 400 | image1 = Nauvoo Illinois Temple.jpg | width1 = 848 | height1 = 839 | alt1 = Daytime East facing view Nauvoo Illinois Temple | caption1 = Daytime east facing view | image2 = Nauvoo Illinois Temple Southwest Night Perspective.jpg | width2 = 2816 | height2 = 2112 | alt2 = Nighttime Southwest facing view of the Nauvoo Illinois Temple | caption2 = Nighttime southwest facing view}}\n\n== Nauvoo Illinois Temple ==\n{{Main|Nauvoo Illinois Temple}}\nFrom 1937 to 1962, the LDS Church reacquired and restored the lot on which the temple stood. In 1999, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] announced the rebuilding of the temple on its original footprint. After two years of construction, on June 27, 2002, the church dedicated the Nauvoo Illinois Temple, whose exterior is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temple]].\n\n==Architecture==\n{{See also|Temple architecture (Latter-day Saints)}}\nAt its base the Nauvoo Temple was {{convert|128|ft|m}} long and {{convert|88|ft|m}} wide with a tower and weather vane reaching to {{convert|65|ft|m}}.  The second temple of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]  was built 60% larger in dimensions than its predecessor, the Kirtland Temple. Like Kirtland, the temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts. Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike [[Kirtland Temple|Kirtland]], it had a full basement which housed a baptismal font.\n\n===Exterior===\n\nThe limestone used for the original temple was quarried from a site just west of the temple. Much of that quarry, however, was submerged by rising water behind the Keokuk Dam in 1912. Therefore, Russellville, Alabama, subsidiary of Minnesota's Vetter Stone Company, was chosen by the Church to provide stone for the new temple. Church officials say the quarry was selected because it provided stone that is a close match to the limestone originally used.\n\n===Basement===\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple basement.png|thumb|right|200px|Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple basement]]\nThe basement of the Nauvoo Temple was used as the [[baptistry]], containing a large [[baptismal font]] in the center of the main room.\n\nThe basement was accessed by spiral staircases at the northwest and southwest corners of the temple. The staircase landing was made of wood and opened to a short hallway heading east, leading to the basement proper. Between the two hallways was an unfinished room sealed off from the rest of the temple, containing an old well that had been dug but never used.  The room was discovered by an [[anti-Mormon]] mob who broke through the floor of the vestibule above.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\nThe basement proper was one hundred feet long and forty feet wide with six rooms of varying sizes on either side. The sides of the rooms were stone and abutted the massive stone piers that supported the floors above. With the exception of the two rooms at the western end of the basement, reportedly used for clerical purposes, each side room rose two steps in height from the basement floor. The rooms were dressing rooms for those using the font. The floor was made of red brick laid in a herringbone pattern. The walls were painted white. The floor sloped down to the center of the room to allow water to run toward a drain beneath the font.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\nDuring an archaeological investigation of the temple site, two highly polished limestone blocks were discovered. Approximately twelve feet east of the entrance to the baptistry and ten feet from either the side of the support piers rested the blocks, roughly fourteen inches square, which projected seven inches (178&nbsp;mm) above the brick floor. These objects are not mentioned in any account of the basement, and their purpose is unknown. They may have held some type of support columns, dividing the font from the entrance to the basement, or they may simply have been a decorative element beneath a vase or something similar.  They may have been part of a feature planned, but not used, in the final construction.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\n====The baptismal font====\n[[File:Piscine de l'\u00e9glise des Mormons (Nauvoo Temple baptismal font).jpg|thumb|200px|The baptismal font (French engraving of 1850)]]\nEvery visitor who wrote about the temple mentioned the baptismal font. It was clearly the most impressive feature of the temple.  There were actually two fonts built during the lifetime of the temple, a temporary wooden one, and a permanent limestone one.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\nThe first font was built out of [[tongue and groove]]d white pine and painted white. It was sixteen feet long, twelve feet wide and four feet deep. The lip of the font was seven feet from the floor. The font's cap and base were carved molding in an \"antique style\" and the sides were finished with panel work.  Two railed stairways led to the font from the north and south sides.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\nThe font was held up by twelve oxen as are almost all temple fonts. They were carved from pine planking that was glued together. They were patterned from the most beautiful five-year-old steer that could be found in the region. The head, shoulders and legs protruded beyond the base of the font, and they appeared to have sunk to their knees into the pavement. The most perfect horn that could be found was used to model the animals' horns.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\nA decision was made to replace the wooden font in 1845, apparently because the water caused a mildew odor, and possibly because the wood had begun to rot. The new limestone font followed the pattern of the wooden one. Twelve oxen held up the basin, four on each side and two at each end. The oxen were solid stone and similarly were placed and appeared sunken into the floor. Where the oxen met the basin, the stone was carved to suggest drapery.  The ears of the oxen were made of tin. The stairs were moved to an east/west orientation making access to the font easier.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\nA well on the east side of the font provided the water supply.  There may have been some kind of tank at the eastern end of the baptistry to store and heat water.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\n===The vestibule===\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple first floor.png|thumb|right|200px|Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple first floor \"Great Hall\" and vestibule]]\nA flight of eight broad steps led to a landing where two more steps entered three archways.  These archways led to the vestibule, the formal entrance to the temple.\nThe archways were approximately nine feet wide and twenty-one feet high.\n\nThe vestibule itself was forty-three feet by seventeen feet in dimension.  It was composed of limestone on all four of its walls. The floor has been speculated to be made of wood, because when the mob occupied the temple briefly in late 1847, they broke through the floor to reach a sealed off room in the basement.  Had the floor been limestone, it seems unlikely that they would have dug it up.\n\nTwo large double doors on the east wall opened to the first floor assembly hall of the lower court, known as the \"Great Hall\". Two doors, one on the North wall, and another on the South opened to the landing of two spiral staircases, one in the Northwest corner, and the other in the Southwest corner which led all the way to the attic.  These were the only access points to the rest of the building.\n\nOne report stated that on the east wall of the vestibule was an entablature, similar to the one in the facade, which read in bright gilded letters, \"THE HOUSE OF THE LORD - Built by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - Commenced April 6th, 1841 - HOLINESS TO THE LORD.\"<ref name=\"Brown 1\">[http://users.marshall.edu/~brown/nauvoo/nt-parent.html Nauvoo Temple Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===The stairwells===\nThe two stairwells were constructed of dressed limestone walls.  One rose from Northwest corner and the other at the Southwest corner of the temple.  They were not true circles but were flatted on four sides.  Nor were they symmetrical, being sixteen feet in diameter from East to West and seventeen feet in diameter from North to South.  This was done to support landings and other support structures.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe staircases, made of wood, provided access to all of the temple from the basement to the attic with a landing at each floor.  They had lamps for illumination at night, and had windows for daytime illumination. William Weeks' elevation of the front facade does not show windows at the basement level of the two stairwells, and photographic evidence is inconclusive.  However, Joseph Smith's youngest son, David Smith, rendered a painting of the temple's damaged facade, clearly shows half-circular windows at the basement level in the north and south corners of the facade.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe staircase in the northwest corner was never completed.  It was roughed in with temporary boards resting on the risers. Workmen used this staircase to gain access to the building during its construction, especially during the winter of 1845-1846 when persons were using the other staircase to reach the attic for ordinance work. The southwest staircase was completely finished for use.  It included lamps for night illumination, and may have been carpeted near the attic landing.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n===The Great Hall===\nEntrance to the first floor assembly hall, called the \"Great Hall\", was through two large double doors at the east end of the vestibule. The Great Hall occupied the remainder of the floor space East of the vestibule. The room was flanked on either side by seven large, arched windows, with four similar windows along the east wall. An arched ceiling spanned some fifty feet in breadth, in the center. the floor was stained wood and the walls were painted white.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThere were two rooms to the north just past the entrance.  It has been suggested that these rooms were used initially by [[William Weeks]], because they are referred by [[Thomas Bullock (Mormon)|Thomas Bullock]] as the \"architect's room.\"  Their eventual intended use is not clear.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n====Pulpits====\nAt the East and West ends of the hall were two sets of similar pulpits.  Resembling the pulpits used in the Kirtland Temple, and repeated in later temples, they were arranged with four levels, the top three consisting of a group of three semi-circular stands.  The lowest level was a drop-table which was raised for use in the [[Sacrament (LDS Church)|sacrament]].<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe pulpits to the East, standing between the windows, were reserved for the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]].  Accordingly, each pulpit had initials identifying the priesthood office of the occupant.  The top most pulpits read ''P.H.P.'', which stood for President of the High Priesthood.  The next level down had ''P.S.Q'' for President of the Seventy Quorums. Below that, the labels were ''P.H.Q.'' which stood for President of the High priests Quorum, and the folding table had the inscription ''P.E.Q.'' standing for President of the Elders Quorum.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nAbove the Eastern pulpits, written in gilded letters, along the arch of the ceiling, were the words,\"The Lord Has Seen Our Sacrifice - Come After Us.\"<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe pulpits to the West end were reserved for the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic Priesthood]]. Each pulpit similarly had initials identifying the priesthood officers who occupied that stand. The highest three pulpits bore the initials ''P.A.P.'', which stood for President of the Aaronic Priesthood. The next lower pulpits had ''P.P.Q.'', for President of the Priests Quorum.  Again, the next had ''P.T.Q.'', for President of the Teachers Quorum and on the table at the bottom was written ''P.D.Q.'', for President of the Deacons Quorum.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n====Pews====\nSimilar to the Kirtland Temple, the hall was fitted with enclosed pews with two aisles running down its length.  There were also pews for a band and choir.  The room could accommodate up to 3,500 people.  Because there were pulpits on both ends of the room, the pews had movable backs which could be swung to face either direction, depending on who was presiding - the Melchizedek Priesthood or the Aaronic Priesthood.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n===First floor mezzanine===\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple first floor mezzanine.png|thumb|right|200px|Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple first floor mezzanine]]\nAccess to the first floor mezzanine was directly from landings of the two staircases in the west end of the building. A foyer, corresponding in size to the vestibule below, connected the two stairway landings.\n\nEvidence suggests that this mezzanine had fourteen small rooms, seven along each side of the North and South wall.  Each room had a small circular window supplying light.  These rooms may never have been completed, except perhaps some kind of partition dividing them.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n===Second floor assembly hall===\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple second floor.png|thumb|right|200px|Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple second floor assembly hall]]\n\nThe second floor hall was similar in construction to the Great Hall, except that it included the foyer area where the vestibule would be.  This made the room about seventeen feet longer. A {{convert|41|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} stone arch ran north and south between the circular stairwells supporting the massive timbers for the tower above.  It had seven large windows along the north and south wide, with four windows along the east wall.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe floor would have a similar configuration as the Great Hall with a set of double pulpits and pews, but the room was never completed.  Doors were never hung, the plastering was unfinished, and the floorboards were only rough timber, not the tongue and grove finished hardwoods of the other floors. The room, when used for an occasional meeting, was furnished with wooden benches.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n===Second floor mezzanine rooms===\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple second floor mezzanine.png|thumb|right|200px|Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple second floor mezzanine]]\nThe second mezzanine was similar to the first floor mezzanine.  It was accessed via the two staircases at the West end of the building.  There was no foyer connecting the two stairwells.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe second floor mezzanine is also presumed to have been divided into fourteen small rooms, seven rooms along each side of the North and South walls of the building, between the arched ceiling of the second floor. Circular windows in the entablature of the building allowed for illumination. Just as with the second floor assembly room, there is no evidence that these rooms were ever completed, except perhaps for the partitions dividing each room. There was a staircase in the second room from the Southeast corner leading to a room above, providing another access method to the attic.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n===Attic===\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple attic.png|thumb|right|200px|Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple attic]]\nAt the top of the two stairways, opening to a foyer, was the attic floor. The attic was not built of limestone but of wood.  It was composed of two sections.  The West end of the temple was a flat roofed section that supported the tower.  The rest of the attic was a pitched-roof section running the length of the temple.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe flat-room section was further divided into two sections, the foyer on the west side, and a suite of rooms to the east.  When the attic was used for ordinance work, they were used as a pantry, wardrobe and storage rooms. The area was illuminated by six windows along the foyer's west wall. Outside windows also provided light along the north and south sides. The roof had four octagonal skylight windows to provide light to the interior rooms, in addition to a twenty-foot arched window.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe incline of the roof prevented a six-foot-tall man from standing erect along the outside wall. The second room from the south-east corner had a stairway leading to a room in the mezzanine below.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n===Tower rooms ===\nRising from the plateau of the attic is an octagonal tower.  The tower was divided into three sections, each accessible by a series of stairways leading from the attic to an observation deck at the top.  The lowest section was the belfry. The bell was rung for various occasions. Between the observation deck and the belfry was a section containing the four clockwork mechanisms.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books\n |1=Joseph Smith\n}}\n{{Portal|Latter Day Saint movement}}\n* [[Comparison of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]\n* [[Joseph Toronto]]\n* [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]\n* [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by geographic region]]\n* [[Temple architecture (LDS Church)]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal\n | author=Brown, Lisle G.\n | title=\"A Perfect Estopel\": Selling the Nauvoo Temple\n | journal=[[Mormon Historical Studies]]\n | volume=3\n | issue=2\n | year=2002\n | pages=61\u201385\n | url=http://mds.marshall.edu/lib_faculty/11/\n }}\n* {{cite journal\n |author      = Brown, Lisle G.\n |year        = 1979\n |title       = The Sacred Departments for Temple Work in Nauvoo: The Assembly Room and the Council Chamber\n |journal     = [[BYU Studies]]\n |volume      = 19\n |issue       = 3\n |pages       = 361\u2013374\n |url         = https://byustudies.byu.edu/showTitle.aspx?title=5380\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140313033855/https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=5380\n |archivedate = March 13, 2014\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n | author=Brown, Lisle G.\n | year=2002\n | title=Nauvoo's Temple Square\n | journal=[[BYU Studies]]\n | volume=41\n | issue=4\n | pages=1\u201345\n | url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/showTitle.aspx?title=6806\n | access-date=March 19, 2013\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021191907/https://byustudies.byu.edu/showTitle.aspx?title=6806\n | archive-date=October 21, 2013\n | url-status=dead\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | author = Colvin, Don\n | title = The Nauvoo Temple: A Story of Faith\n | year = 2002\n | location = American Fork, Utah\n | publisher = [[Covenant Communications]]\n }}\n* {{cite journal\n | author=Crocket, David R.\n | title=The Nauvoo Temple, A Monument of the Saints\n | journal=[[Nauvoo Journal]]\n | volume=11\n | issue=1\n | year=1999\n | pages=5\u201330\n | url=http://www.mormonhistoricsitesfoundation.org/publications/nj_fall1999/NJ11.2_Crockett.pdf\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | author = McBride, Mathew S.\n | title = A House for the Most High: The Story of the Original Nauvoo Temple\n | year = 2007\n | location = Salt Lake City, Utah\n | publisher = Greg Kofford Books\n | isbn = 1-58958-016-8\n }}\n* ''Nauvoo: History in the Making.''

When the main body of the church was forced out of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], Illinois, in the winter of 1846, the church attempted to sell the building, finally succeeding in 1848.  The building was damaged by fire and a tornado before being demolished.\n\nIn 1937, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) reacquired the lot on which the original temple had stood. In 2000, the church began to build a temple on the original site whose exterior is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern [[Temple (LDS Church)|Latter-day Saint temple]].  On June 27, 2002, a date that coincided with the 158th anniversary of the [[Death of Joseph Smith|death]] of [[Joseph Smith|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith]], the temple was dedicated by the LDS Church as the [[Nauvoo Illinois Temple]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:NauvooTemple.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Rendition of the Nauvoo Temple published in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's Monthly]]'']]\nThe Latter Day Saints made preparations to build a temple soon after establishing their headquarters at [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], Illinois, in 1839.  On April 6, 1841, the temple's cornerstone was laid under the direction of [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and [[Sidney Rigdon]] gave the principal oration.  At its base the building was {{convert|128|ft|m}} long and {{convert|88|ft|m}} wide with a [[clock tower]] and [[weather vane]] reaching to  a total height of {{convert|165|ft|m}}&mdash;a 60% increase over the dimensions of the Kirtland Temple.  Like Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts.  Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple had a full basement which housed a [[Baptism for the dead|baptismal font]]. Because the Saints had to abandon Nauvoo, the building was not entirely completed. The basement with its font was finished, as were the first floor assembly hall and the attic. When these parts of the building were completed they were used for performing ordinances (basement and attic) or for worship services (first floor assembly hall).\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple Sunstone 2003.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A Sunstone from the original Nauvoo Temple in a case in front of LDS Church's Visitor Center in Nauvoo]]\nThe Nauvoo Temple was designed in the [[Greek Revival]] style by architect [[William Weeks]], under the direction of Joseph Smith. Weeks' design made use of distinctively Latter Day Saint motifs, including Sunstones, Moonstones, and Starstones. It is often mistakenly thought that these stones represent the Three [[Degrees of Glory]] in the Latter Day Saint conception of the afterlife, but the stones appear in the wrong order. Instead, Wandle Mace, foreman for the framework of the Nauvoo Temple, has explained that the design of the temple was meant to be \"a representation of the Church, the Bride, the Lamb's wife\" (Wandle Mace, Autobiography 207 (BYU Special Collections)). In this regard Mace references John's statement in Revelation 12:1 concerning the \"woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.\" This explains why the Starstones are at the top of the temple (\"crown of twelve stars\"), the Sunstones in the middle (\"clothed with the sun\") and the Moonstones at the bottom (\"moon under her feet\").\n\nConstruction was only half complete at the [[Death of Joseph Smith]] in 1844.  After a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]], [[Brigham Young]] was sustained as the church's leader by the majority of Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo.  As [[mob violence]] increased during the summer of 1845, he encouraged the Latter Day Saints to complete the temple even as they prepared to abandon the city, so portions of it could be used for Latter Day Saint [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]], such as [[Baptism for the dead|baptisms for the dead]] in the basement font. During the winter of 1845-46, the temple began to be used for additional ordinances, including the Nauvoo-era [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]], [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealings]] in marriage, and [[Law of adoption (Latter Day Saints)|adoptions]]. The Nauvoo Temple was in use for less than three months.\n\nMost of the Latter Day Saints left Nauvoo, beginning in February 1846, but a small crew remained to finish the temple's first floor, so that it could be formally dedicated.  Once the first floor was finished with pulpits and benches, the building was finally dedicated in private services on April 30, 1846, and in public services on 1 May.  In September 1846 the remaining Latter Day Saints were driven from the city and [[vigilantes]] from the neighboring region, including [[Carthage, Illinois]], entered the near-empty city and vandalized the temple.\n\nInitially the church's agents tried to lease the structure, first to the [[Catholic Church]], and then to private individuals. When this failed, they attempted to sell the temple, asking up to $200,000, but this effort also met with no success. On March 11, 1848, the LDS Church's agents sold the building to David T. LeBaron, for $5,000. Finally, the New York Home Missionary Society expressed interest in leasing the building as a school, but around midnight on October 8\u20139, 1848, the temple was set on fire by an unknown arsonist.  Nauvoo's residents attempted to put out the fire, but the temple was gutted.  [[James J. Strang]], leader of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)|Strangite faction]] of Latter Day Saints, accused Young's agents of setting fire to the temple.  However, Strang's charges were never proven. On April 2, 1849, LeBaron sold the damaged temple to [[\u00c9tienne Cabet]] for $2,000. Cabet, whose followers were called [[Icarians]], hoped to establish Nauvoo as a [[communism|communistic]] [[utopia]].<ref name=chronology>{{cite web |title=Chronology of the Construction, Destruction, and Reconstruction of the Nauvoo Temple |url=http://users.marshall.edu/~brown/nauvoo/chrono.html |date=February 2000 |author=Brown, Lisle G. |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction ===\n[[File:Nauvootemplefirecca.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Nauvoo Temple burning]]\nAfter the fire of October 9, 1848, only the four exterior walls remained standing.<ref>{{citation |last1= Harrington |first1= Virginia S. |last2= Harrington |first2= J.C. |author2-link= J.C.

However, on May 27, 1850, Nauvoo was struck by a major tornado which toppled one of the walls of the temple.  One source claimed the storm seemed to \"single out the Temple\", felling \"the walls with a roar that was heard miles away\".<ref>{{citation |last1= Horner |first1= Henry |year= 1939 |title= Illinois, A Descriptive and Historical Guide |place= Chicago |publisher= Federal Writer's Project of the Work Projects Administration for the State of Illinois |page= 352 }}</ref>  Cabet ordered the demolition of two more walls in the interests of public safety, leaving only the fa\u00e7ade standing. The Icarians used much of the temple's stone to build a new school building on the southwest corner of the temple lot. By 1857, however, most of Cabet's followers had left Nauvoo and over time many of the original stones for the temple were used in the construction of other buildings throughout [[Hancock County, Illinois|Hancock County]]. In February 1865, Nauvoo's City Council ordered the final demolition of the last standing portion of the temple&mdash;one lone corner of the fa\u00e7ade. Soon afterwards, all evidence of the temple disappeared, except for a hand pump over a well that supplied water to the baptismal font.<ref name=chronology/>  Three of the original sunstones are known to have survived and are on display&mdash;one is on loan to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Visitor Center in Nauvoo, one is in the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C, and the third and only one that has not been restored is displayed, along with the only moonstone on display, at the Joseph Smith Historic Center of the [[Community of Christ]].\n{{-}}\n{{multiple image | caption_align=center| header_align=center | header = Reconstructed [[Nauvoo Illinois Temple|LDS Nauvoo Illinois Temple]], dedicated 2002 | align = right | direction = horizontal | total_width = 400 | image1 = Nauvoo Illinois Temple.jpg | width1 = 848 | height1 = 839 | alt1 = Daytime East facing view Nauvoo Illinois Temple | caption1 = Daytime east facing view | image2 = Nauvoo Illinois Temple Southwest Night Perspective.jpg | width2 = 2816 | height2 = 2112 | alt2 = Nighttime Southwest facing view of the Nauvoo Illinois Temple | caption2 = Nighttime southwest facing view}}\n\n== Nauvoo Illinois Temple ==\n{{Main|Nauvoo Illinois Temple}}\nFrom 1937 to 1962, the LDS Church reacquired and restored the lot on which the temple stood. In 1999, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] announced the rebuilding of the temple on its original footprint. After two years of construction, on June 27, 2002, the church dedicated the Nauvoo Illinois Temple, whose exterior is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temple]].\n\n==Architecture==\n{{See also|Temple architecture (Latter-day Saints)}}\nAt its base the Nauvoo Temple was {{convert|128|ft|m}} long and {{convert|88|ft|m}} wide with a tower and weather vane reaching to {{convert|65|ft|m}}.  The second temple of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]  was built 60% larger in dimensions than its predecessor, the Kirtland Temple. Like Kirtland, the temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts. Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike [[Kirtland Temple|Kirtland]], it had a full basement which housed a baptismal font.\n\n===Exterior===\n\nThe limestone used for the original temple was quarried from a site just west of the temple. Much of that quarry, however, was submerged by rising water behind the Keokuk Dam in 1912. Therefore, Russellville, Alabama, subsidiary of Minnesota's Vetter Stone Company, was chosen by the Church to provide stone for the new temple. Church officials say the quarry was selected because it provided stone that is a close match to the limestone originally used.\n\n===Basement===\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple basement.png|thumb|right|200px|Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple basement]]\nThe basement of the Nauvoo Temple was used as the [[baptistry]], containing a large [[baptismal font]] in the center of the main room.\n\nThe basement was accessed by spiral staircases at the northwest and southwest corners of the temple. The staircase landing was made of wood and opened to a short hallway heading east, leading to the basement proper. Between the two hallways was an unfinished room sealed off from the rest of the temple, containing an old well that had been dug but never used.  The room was discovered by an [[anti-Mormon]] mob who broke through the floor of the vestibule above.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\nThe basement proper was one hundred feet long and forty feet wide with six rooms of varying sizes on either side. The sides of the rooms were stone and abutted the massive stone piers that supported the floors above. With the exception of the two rooms at the western end of the basement, reportedly used for clerical purposes, each side room rose two steps in height from the basement floor. The rooms were dressing rooms for those using the font. The floor was made of red brick laid in a herringbone pattern. The walls were painted white. The floor sloped down to the center of the room to allow water to run toward a drain beneath the font.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\nDuring an archaeological investigation of the temple site, two highly polished limestone blocks were discovered. Approximately twelve feet east of the entrance to the baptistry and ten feet from either the side of the support piers rested the blocks, roughly fourteen inches square, which projected seven inches (178&nbsp;mm) above the brick floor. These objects are not mentioned in any account of the basement, and their purpose is unknown. They may have held some type of support columns, dividing the font from the entrance to the basement, or they may simply have been a decorative element beneath a vase or something similar.  They may have been part of a feature planned, but not used, in the final construction.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\n====The baptismal font====\n[[File:Piscine de l'\u00e9glise des Mormons (Nauvoo Temple baptismal font).jpg|thumb|200px|The baptismal font (French engraving of 1850)]]\nEvery visitor who wrote about the temple mentioned the baptismal font. It was clearly the most impressive feature of the temple.  There were actually two fonts built during the lifetime of the temple, a temporary wooden one, and a permanent limestone one.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\nThe first font was built out of [[tongue and groove]]d white pine and painted white. It was sixteen feet long, twelve feet wide and four feet deep. The lip of the font was seven feet from the floor. The font's cap and base were carved molding in an \"antique style\" and the sides were finished with panel work.  Two railed stairways led to the font from the north and south sides.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\nThe font was held up by twelve oxen as are almost all temple fonts. They were carved from pine planking that was glued together. They were patterned from the most beautiful five-year-old steer that could be found in the region. The head, shoulders and legs protruded beyond the base of the font, and they appeared to have sunk to their knees into the pavement. The most perfect horn that could be found was used to model the animals' horns.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\nA decision was made to replace the wooden font in 1845, apparently because the water caused a mildew odor, and possibly because the wood had begun to rot. The new limestone font followed the pattern of the wooden one. Twelve oxen held up the basin, four on each side and two at each end. The oxen were solid stone and similarly were placed and appeared sunken into the floor. Where the oxen met the basin, the stone was carved to suggest drapery.  The ears of the oxen were made of tin. The stairs were moved to an east/west orientation making access to the font easier.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\nA well on the east side of the font provided the water supply.  There may have been some kind of tank at the eastern end of the baptistry to store and heat water.<ref name=\"Brown 1\"/>\n\n===The vestibule===\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple first floor.png|thumb|right|200px|Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple first floor \"Great Hall\" and vestibule]]\nA flight of eight broad steps led to a landing where two more steps entered three archways.  These archways led to the vestibule, the formal entrance to the temple.\nThe archways were approximately nine feet wide and twenty-one feet high.\n\nThe vestibule itself was forty-three feet by seventeen feet in dimension.  It was composed of limestone on all four of its walls. The floor has been speculated to be made of wood, because when the mob occupied the temple briefly in late 1847, they broke through the floor to reach a sealed off room in the basement.  Had the floor been limestone, it seems unlikely that they would have dug it up.\n\nTwo large double doors on the east wall opened to the first floor assembly hall of the lower court, known as the \"Great Hall\". Two doors, one on the North wall, and another on the South opened to the landing of two spiral staircases, one in the Northwest corner, and the other in the Southwest corner which led all the way to the attic.  These were the only access points to the rest of the building.\n\nOne report stated that on the east wall of the vestibule was an entablature, similar to the one in the facade, which read in bright gilded letters, \"THE HOUSE OF THE LORD - Built by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - Commenced April 6th, 1841 - HOLINESS TO THE LORD.\"<ref name=\"Brown 1\">[http://users.marshall.edu/~brown/nauvoo/nt-parent.html Nauvoo Temple Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===The stairwells===\nThe two stairwells were constructed of dressed limestone walls.  One rose from Northwest corner and the other at the Southwest corner of the temple.  They were not true circles but were flatted on four sides.  Nor were they symmetrical, being sixteen feet in diameter from East to West and seventeen feet in diameter from North to South.  This was done to support landings and other support structures.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe staircases, made of wood, provided access to all of the temple from the basement to the attic with a landing at each floor.  They had lamps for illumination at night, and had windows for daytime illumination. William Weeks' elevation of the front facade does not show windows at the basement level of the two stairwells, and photographic evidence is inconclusive.  However, Joseph Smith's youngest son, David Smith, rendered a painting of the temple's damaged facade, clearly shows half-circular windows at the basement level in the north and south corners of the facade.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe staircase in the northwest corner was never completed.  It was roughed in with temporary boards resting on the risers. Workmen used this staircase to gain access to the building during its construction, especially during the winter of 1845-1846 when persons were using the other staircase to reach the attic for ordinance work. The southwest staircase was completely finished for use.  It included lamps for night illumination, and may have been carpeted near the attic landing.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n===The Great Hall===\nEntrance to the first floor assembly hall, called the \"Great Hall\", was through two large double doors at the east end of the vestibule. The Great Hall occupied the remainder of the floor space East of the vestibule. The room was flanked on either side by seven large, arched windows, with four similar windows along the east wall. An arched ceiling spanned some fifty feet in breadth, in the center. the floor was stained wood and the walls were painted white.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThere were two rooms to the north just past the entrance.  It has been suggested that these rooms were used initially by [[William Weeks]], because they are referred by [[Thomas Bullock (Mormon)|Thomas Bullock]] as the \"architect's room.\"  Their eventual intended use is not clear.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n====Pulpits====\nAt the East and West ends of the hall were two sets of similar pulpits.  Resembling the pulpits used in the Kirtland Temple, and repeated in later temples, they were arranged with four levels, the top three consisting of a group of three semi-circular stands.  The lowest level was a drop-table which was raised for use in the [[Sacrament (LDS Church)|sacrament]].<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe pulpits to the East, standing between the windows, were reserved for the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]].  Accordingly, each pulpit had initials identifying the priesthood office of the occupant.  The top most pulpits read ''P.H.P.'', which stood for President of the High Priesthood.  The next level down had ''P.S.Q'' for President of the Seventy Quorums. Below that, the labels were ''P.H.Q.'' which stood for President of the High priests Quorum, and the folding table had the inscription ''P.E.Q.'' standing for President of the Elders Quorum.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nAbove the Eastern pulpits, written in gilded letters, along the arch of the ceiling, were the words,\"The Lord Has Seen Our Sacrifice - Come After Us.\"<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe pulpits to the West end were reserved for the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic Priesthood]]. Each pulpit similarly had initials identifying the priesthood officers who occupied that stand. The highest three pulpits bore the initials ''P.A.P.'', which stood for President of the Aaronic Priesthood. The next lower pulpits had ''P.P.Q.'', for President of the Priests Quorum.  Again, the next had ''P.T.Q.'', for President of the Teachers Quorum and on the table at the bottom was written ''P.D.Q.'', for President of the Deacons Quorum.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n====Pews====\nSimilar to the Kirtland Temple, the hall was fitted with enclosed pews with two aisles running down its length.  There were also pews for a band and choir.  The room could accommodate up to 3,500 people.  Because there were pulpits on both ends of the room, the pews had movable backs which could be swung to face either direction, depending on who was presiding - the Melchizedek Priesthood or the Aaronic Priesthood.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n===First floor mezzanine===\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple first floor mezzanine.png|thumb|right|200px|Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple first floor mezzanine]]\nAccess to the first floor mezzanine was directly from landings of the two staircases in the west end of the building. A foyer, corresponding in size to the vestibule below, connected the two stairway landings.\n\nEvidence suggests that this mezzanine had fourteen small rooms, seven along each side of the North and South wall.  Each room had a small circular window supplying light.  These rooms may never have been completed, except perhaps some kind of partition dividing them.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n===Second floor assembly hall===\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple second floor.png|thumb|right|200px|Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple second floor assembly hall]]\n\nThe second floor hall was similar in construction to the Great Hall, except that it included the foyer area where the vestibule would be.  This made the room about seventeen feet longer. A {{convert|41|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} stone arch ran north and south between the circular stairwells supporting the massive timbers for the tower above.  It had seven large windows along the north and south wide, with four windows along the east wall.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe floor would have a similar configuration as the Great Hall with a set of double pulpits and pews, but the room was never completed.  Doors were never hung, the plastering was unfinished, and the floorboards were only rough timber, not the tongue and grove finished hardwoods of the other floors. The room, when used for an occasional meeting, was furnished with wooden benches.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n===Second floor mezzanine rooms===\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple second floor mezzanine.png|thumb|right|200px|Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple second floor mezzanine]]\nThe second mezzanine was similar to the first floor mezzanine.  It was accessed via the two staircases at the West end of the building.  There was no foyer connecting the two stairwells.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe second floor mezzanine is also presumed to have been divided into fourteen small rooms, seven rooms along each side of the North and South walls of the building, between the arched ceiling of the second floor. Circular windows in the entablature of the building allowed for illumination. Just as with the second floor assembly room, there is no evidence that these rooms were ever completed, except perhaps for the partitions dividing each room. There was a staircase in the second room from the Southeast corner leading to a room above, providing another access method to the attic.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n===Attic===\n[[File:Nauvoo Temple attic.png|thumb|right|200px|Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple attic]]\nAt the top of the two stairways, opening to a foyer, was the attic floor. The attic was not built of limestone but of wood.  It was composed of two sections.  The West end of the temple was a flat roofed section that supported the tower.  The rest of the attic was a pitched-roof section running the length of the temple.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe flat-room section was further divided into two sections, the foyer on the west side, and a suite of rooms to the east.  When the attic was used for ordinance work, they were used as a pantry, wardrobe and storage rooms. The area was illuminated by six windows along the foyer's west wall. Outside windows also provided light along the north and south sides. The roof had four octagonal skylight windows to provide light to the interior rooms, in addition to a twenty-foot arched window.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\nThe incline of the roof prevented a six-foot-tall man from standing erect along the outside wall. The second room from the south-east corner had a stairway leading to a room in the mezzanine below.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n\n===Tower rooms ===\nRising from the plateau of the attic is an octagonal tower.  The tower was divided into three sections, each accessible by a series of stairways leading from the attic to an observation deck at the top.  The lowest section was the belfry. The bell was rung for various occasions. Between the observation deck and the belfry was a section containing the four clockwork mechanisms.<ref name=\"Brown 1\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books\n |1=Joseph Smith\n}}\n{{Portal|Latter Day Saint movement}}\n* [[Comparison of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]\n* [[Joseph Toronto]]\n* [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]\n* [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by geographic region]]\n* [[Temple architecture (LDS Church)]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal\n | author=Brown, Lisle G.\n | title=\"A Perfect Estopel\": Selling the Nauvoo Temple\n | journal=[[Mormon Historical Studies]]\n | volume=3\n | issue=2\n | year=2002\n | pages=61\u201385\n | url=http://mds.marshall.edu/lib_faculty/11/\n }}\n* {{cite journal\n |author      = Brown, Lisle G.\n |year        = 1979\n |title       = The Sacred Departments for Temple Work in Nauvoo: The Assembly Room and the Council Chamber\n |journal     = [[BYU Studies]]\n |volume      = 19\n |issue       = 3\n |pages       = 361\u2013374\n |url         = https://byustudies.byu.edu/showTitle.aspx?title=5380\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140313033855/https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=5380\n |archivedate = March 13, 2014\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n | author=Brown, Lisle G.\n | year=2002\n | title=Nauvoo's Temple Square\n | journal=[[BYU Studies]]\n | volume=41\n | issue=4\n | pages=1\u201345\n | url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/showTitle.aspx?title=6806\n | access-date=March 19, 2013\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021191907/https://byustudies.byu.edu/showTitle.aspx?title=6806\n | archive-date=October 21, 2013\n | url-status=dead\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | author = Colvin, Don\n | title = The Nauvoo Temple: A Story of Faith\n | year = 2002\n | location = American Fork, Utah\n | publisher = [[Covenant Communications]]\n }}\n* {{cite journal\n | author=Crocket, David R.\n | title=The Nauvoo Temple, A Monument of the Saints\n | journal=[[Nauvoo Journal]]\n | volume=11\n | issue=1\n | year=1999\n | pages=5\u201330\n | url=http://www.mormonhistoricsitesfoundation.org/publications/nj_fall1999/NJ11.2_Crockett.pdf\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | author = McBride, Mathew S.\n | title = A House for the Most High: The Story of the Original Nauvoo Temple\n | year = 2007\n | location = Salt Lake City, Utah\n | publisher = Greg Kofford Books\n | isbn = 1-58958-016-8\n }}\n* ''Nauvoo: History in the Making.''

{"title_page": "Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n{{howto|date=April 2013}}\n}}\n\n{{Cuisine of China}}\n\n'''Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining''' are the traditional behaviors observed while eating in [[Greater China]]. Traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] customs have spread throughout [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asia]] to varying degrees, with some regions sharing a few aspects of formal dining, which has ranged from guest seating to paying the bill.\n\n==Table and place settings==\n[[File:HK Sai Ying Pun \u540d\u661f\u6d77\u9bae\u9152\u5bb6 Star Seafood Restaurant round table March-2012 Ip4.jpg|thumb|right|Typical place settings before a meal is served]]\nIn most traditional Chinese dining, dishes are shared [[Communal bowl|communally]]. Although both square and rectangular tables are used for small groups of people, round tables are preferred for large groups, particularly in restaurants, in order to permit easy sharing. [[Lazy Susan]] turntables are a common feature at the center of larger tables, to facilitate passing of serving dishes. \n\nA basic [[place setting]] consists of a small teacup; a large plate with a small, empty rice bowl; a set of chopsticks, usually on the right of the plate; and a soup spoon. Additions may include a chopstick rest or holder, a large water or wine glass, and a smaller glass for ''[[baijiu]]''. Occasionally a small shallow dish is left for each diner, to hold a small amount of a condiment or sauce.\n\nAt homes and low-end restaurants, napkins may consist of [[Tissue paper|paper tissues]] or occasionally must be provided by the diner. High restaurants often provide cloth napkins similar to Western dining as part of the place settings.\n\nUnlike some Western restaurants, powdered salt, pepper, or sugar are rarely provided at the table. Sometimes bottles of soy sauce, vinegar, hot sauce, or other condiments are available.[[Black vinegar]] is popular in the north of China as a dipping sauce, particularly for dumplings.<ref>{{Citation|title=Black vinegar|date=2020-04-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_vinegar&oldid=950867267|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Formal seating order ===\nThere is a specific [[Seating plan|seating order]] to every [[formal dinner]], based on seniority and organizational hierarchy. The [[seat of honor]], reserved for the host or the oldest person, is usually the position in the center facing east or facing the entrance to the room. Guests with higher status then sit in close proximity to the seat of honor, while those with lower positions sit further away. The least pretigious seat is generally the one nearest to the kitchen entrance or service door.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internations.org/hong-kong-expats/guide/15908-culture-shopping-recreation/dining-in-hong-kong-etiquette-15914|title=Dining in Hong Kong: Etiquette|website=www.internations.org}}</ref>In a formal banquet hall of many tables, the main table is the one which situates furthest from the entrance. The tables on the left hand side of the main tables are, in order of importance, second, fourth, sixth and so on, and those on the right are third, fifth and seventh. Guests are seated according to their status and cohesion with the host of the banquet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cits.net/china-travel-guide/seating-arrangements-of-chinese-banquet.html|title=Seating Arrangements of Chinese Banquet - CITS|website=www.cits.net|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Sequencing of a meal==\nWide variations exist throughout China, but the vast majority of full-course dinners are very similar in terms of timing and dishes.\n\n===Beverages===\n[[File:Chinese teapot.JPG|thumb|right|An 18th century Chinese porcelain hand painted blue and white teapot]]\nHot tea is almost always provided, either in advance of the diners being seated or immediately afterward. It can be consumed at leisure throughout the meal. Hot or cold water is sometimes served, but tea is the default beverage. A verbal \"thank you\" ({{zh|s=\u8c22\u8c22|p=xiexie|labels=no}}) may be offered to the server pouring a refill or, if in the middle of a conversation where it would be rude to interrupt the speaker, the table may be [[Chinese tea culture#Finger tapping|tapped twice with two bent fingers]] instead. Never pour a full cup of tea in China. Like wines in Western culture, tea in China is more of a sense and concept than taste.Fill about 70 percent of a cup with tea, as the other 30 percent is space for your emotions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnn.com/food/beverages/photos/perfect-cup-tea-around-globe/tea-tour|title=The perfect cup of tea around the globe|website=MNN - Mother Nature Network|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n===Appetizers===\nAppetizers are the first items presented. Two or more small dishes are brought to the table, holding boiled unsalted peanuts, salted roasted peanuts, crispy fried noodles, or similar dishes. These may be consumed while ordering the main courses, or while waiting for other dishes to arrive.\n\n===Soup===\nA hot soup may be served as one of the dishes, usually near the beginning of the meal. For small meals, especially at home, it may replace the diners' beverage entirely.\n\n===Main courses===\n{{see also|Dim sum}}\nUnlike Western-style meals, there are usually multiple main dishes which are sampled by all the diners; usually there is one communally-shared dish ordered per person seated at a table. A celebratory event such as a graduation or wedding often features over ten dishes, often an odd number for good luck.\n \nWhite steamed rice is provided in small bowls and food is often placed over it, flavoring it with their sauces. The rice is consumed little by little along with the other dishes and not separately, unless the diner remains hungry after the last dish has been removed.\n\n===Final course===\nNear the end of the meal, a starchy, filling dish such as noodles, [[jiaozi|Chinese dumplings]], or ''[[baozi]]'' is sometimes served, to ensure that guests are fully satiated. In extremely formal settings, only a small amount of this final dish is taken by the diners, to avoid implying that the host was not sufficiently generous in planning the meal.\n\n===Dessert===\nInformal meals may not have a dessert course at all, or offer sweet foods that are particular favorites of the diners. Fresh fruit (often slices of citrus) or fresh or canned pineapple are often offered in restaurants.\n\nOther common desserts are [[tapioca]] or [[rice pudding]], or a hot or cold soup flavored with [[red bean soup|sweet red beans]]. Ice cream may be offered, often flavored with [[ginger]], [[Red bean ice|sweet red beans]], or a delicate tea.\n\n[[Fortune cookie]]s are rarely offered by authentic Chinese restaurants, even in North America where they were invented. They are considered a lightweight amusement, suitable for informal gatherings of close friends and family. Fancier restaurants may offer mints or occasionally chocolates as breath fresheners.\n\n==Manners and customs ==\nEating is a dominant aspect of [[Chinese culture]], and eating out is one of the most common ways to honor guests, socialize, and deepen friendships.<ref name=\"Dob\">Dobsons, Richard. ''China Cycle'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwBFSfy_f0C&pg=RA1-PA20 p. 20]. 2006. 8 Feb 2010.</ref>\n\nProper [[etiquette]] is very important to traditional Chinese people, who feel good manners invite [[luck]], but boorish conduct brings [[shame]]. Although many [[Mao Zedong|Maoist]] programs tried to curtail traditional social practices, today table etiquette is again taken as an indication of educational status and good upbringing. For example, a child misusing their chopsticks at a formal dinner might embarrass their family, who are responsible for teaching the child.<ref name=\"Dob\"/><ref name=\"Cha\"/>\n\n===Personal behavior===\n{{See also|Eating utensil etiquette}}\nSince [[chopsticks]] (and [[spoon]]s) are used in place of [[fork]]s and [[knives]], [[Chinese cuisine]] tends to serve dishes in bite-size pieces or employ cooking techniques that render dishes such as fish or ''[[hong shao rou]]'' soft enough to be picked apart easily.<ref name=\"Inn\">Inness, Sherrie. \"Home Cooking .\" Kitchen Culture in America: Popular Representations of Food, Gender, and Race (2001): 14.

One should not spear food with chopsticks although people sometimes do it if the food is too slippery. Chopsticks are not to be used to point at people, pick teeth, bang the bowls, move the bowls, nor to be chewed on or waved around. They should be held so that the ends are even, and never separated in any way (such as holding one in each hand). \n\nWhen not in use, chopsticks should be left on chopstick rests when provided, or placed across the bowl or plate. They should never be left sticking upright out of food, evoking images of incense or \"joss\" sticks used ceremoniously at funerals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture-4-travel.com/chopstick-etiquette.html|title=Chinese Chopstick Etiquette|work=Culture-4-Travel.com}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, a diner is supposed to hold the chopsticks in the right hand and with the left hand either hold down the bowl on the table or pick it up so that it is near the mouth, or at least put the left hand on the table; eating with the chopsticks in the left hand or steadily with only one hand on the table is perceived as unproper table manners.{{Why?|reason=Why is this perceived as rude behaviour? The fact that this way to handle food is traditionally claimed and perceived to be rude does not mean the perception is correct. There is no concrete evidence that this perception is correct, and that both hands should be used when eating is in fact no rule or law; perception is a more correct word.|date=February 2020}}{{Fix|text=reliable source??}}{{dubious|date=January 2020}} However, that perception has started to fade away in modern time.{{when?|date=March 2020}}{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} It is, however, never considered rude to lift a rice bowl with one hand to scoop rice into the mouth using chopsticks in the other hand.\n\nCondiments, such as [[soy sauce]], [[duck sauce]], or [[sesame oil]], are sometimes served in small shallow dishes to allow pieces of food to be dipped as desired. They may not be routinely provided at high-quality restaurants; the assumption is that perfectly-prepared food needs no condiments, and the quality of the food can be best appreciated as prepared by the master chef.\n\nIt is considered virtuous for diners to not leave any bit of wasted food on their plates or bowls. If significant amounts of untouched food are left over in the serving dishes after a meal, it is often considered a compliment to the chef to request that it be packaged for takeout, to be enjoyed later at home.\n\n===Inviting guests===\nAlthough individual households may have their own house rules, the Chinese traditions used to welcome guests are largely the same throughout the country.<ref name=\"Mor\">Morse, Edward.

Accessed 21 Jan 2010.</ref>\n\nCommunal eating is very common in China, encompassing informal meals among close friends and family, as well as more formal meals and banquets to celebrate special occasions. In addition to providing opportunities for socializing, shared meals allow the diners to sample a wider range of dishes than if they were ordering individually.\n\n===Communal eating===\n[[File:Spoon and chopsticks.jpg|thumb|upright|Serving chopsticks (''gongkuai'') on the far right, personal chopsticks (''putongkuai'' or ''sikuai'') in the middle, and a spoon. Serving chopsticks are usually more ornate and longer than the personal ones.]]\nThere appears to be no Chinese word for communal eating and using one's personal chopsticks in the serving dish. However, at some formal meals, there may be pairs of communal serving chopsticks ({{lang|zh|\u516c\u7b77}}, ''gongkuai''). These are sets of chopsticks specifically for shared dishes only. Often, these will be distinct from the ''putongkuai'' ({{lang|zh|\u666e\u901a\u7b77}}, regular chopsticks) or ''sikuai'' ({{lang|zh|\u79c1\u7b77}}, personal chopsticks) in that they will be longer and more ornate. There will sometimes be one set of communal chopsticks per dish or one set per course. The ratio varies.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false 9][https://books.google.com/books?id=0TV8ebayzNUC&pg=PA26&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false 10][https://books.google.com/books?id=npxUXbUg6uUC&pg=PA164&dq=chopstick+manners&hl=en#v=onepage&q=chopsticks&f=false 11]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=32uyAAAAIAAJ&q=chopstick+etiquette&dq=chopstick+etiquette&hl=en 12]</ref> If there are no ''gongkuai'' set on the table, it is never rude to request that they be provided; others will just think that you are a stickler for formality and good manners.\n\nIt is also considered extremely rude to dig for a choice food morsel on the serving plate instead of picking up the piece that is closest to the diner, thus demonstrating fairness and sharing with others. The shunned practice is sometimes called \"digging one's grave\". Likewise, it is impolite to hoard or take most of a dish until it has been offered to everyone and the other diners have had a chance to sample it. For this reason, it is common to take a smaller amount from the dishes on the first round, and to keep the other diners in mind when taking a larger second helping.\n\nThe last piece of food on a communal dish is never served to oneself without asking for permission. When offered the last bit of food, it may sometimes be considered rude to refuse the offer.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}{{dubious|date=February 2020}} \n\n===Lazy Susan (turntable)===\n[[File:Lazy Susan.jpg|thumb|A Lazy Susan in use]]\nA [[Lazy Susan]] turntable is a large circular rotating platform placed at the center of a table, and used to easily share a large number of dishes among the diners. A Lazy Susan can be made from many materials, but most often they are constructed of glass, wood, or plastic.\n\nIt is typical for all the dishes for each course to be brought out together and placed around the perimeter of the Lazy Susan. It the turntable is large, a decorative centerpiece may occupy the center, since any food placed there would be out of reach of a seated diner. Alternatively, shared table condiments such as soy sauce, hot sauce, vinegar, or sesame oil may be located at the center.\n\nIf the dishes come out one at a time or if there is some special delicacy, they are typically served to the guest of honor first and then rotated clockwise around the table. The host will often wait to serve himself last. Dishes should typically not be removed from the Lazy Susan and placed on the table: at most, one should hold the dish aloft while serving and then return it to its place on the tray. One should try to avoid moving the Lazy Susan even slightly when someone is in the act of transferring food from the dishes to their plate or bowl. \n\n===Alcohol===\nWater and other non-alcoholic beverages may be consumed at any time. However, in formal settings, alcohol should only be consumed during [[toast (honor)|toasts]]. A modest toast may be followed by a single sip of wine or swallow of beer, but a ''baijiu'' toast is often ended with ''Ganbei!'' ({{lang|zh|\u5e72\u676f}}), an exhortation to drain the glass. Ideally, glasses are refilled immediately following a toast in preparation for the next.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn informal settings, individuals may order their preferred drinks. Carbonated beverages or beer are often ordered, although many diners may be satisfied with tea or hot water.\n\n==Bill (check)==\nThe bill for the meal (often call the \"check\") is presented at the end of the meal, after all the food and drinks have been served.

Traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] customs have spread throughout [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asia]] to varying degrees, with some regions sharing a few aspects of formal dining, which has ranged from guest seating to paying the bill.\n\n==Table and place settings==\n[[File:HK Sai Ying Pun \u540d\u661f\u6d77\u9bae\u9152\u5bb6 Star Seafood Restaurant round table March-2012 Ip4.jpg|thumb|right|Typical place settings before a meal is served]]\nIn most traditional Chinese dining, dishes are shared [[Communal bowl|communally]]. Although both square and rectangular tables are used for small groups of people, round tables are preferred for large groups, particularly in restaurants, in order to permit easy sharing. [[Lazy Susan]] turntables are a common feature at the center of larger tables, to facilitate passing of serving dishes. \n\nA basic [[place setting]] consists of a small teacup; a large plate with a small, empty rice bowl; a set of chopsticks, usually on the right of the plate; and a soup spoon. Additions may include a chopstick rest or holder, a large water or wine glass, and a smaller glass for ''[[baijiu]]''. Occasionally a small shallow dish is left for each diner, to hold a small amount of a condiment or sauce.\n\nAt homes and low-end restaurants, napkins may consist of [[Tissue paper|paper tissues]] or occasionally must be provided by the diner. High restaurants often provide cloth napkins similar to Western dining as part of the place settings.\n\nUnlike some Western restaurants, powdered salt, pepper, or sugar are rarely provided at the table. Sometimes bottles of soy sauce, vinegar, hot sauce, or other condiments are available.[[Black vinegar]] is popular in the north of China as a dipping sauce, particularly for dumplings.<ref>{{Citation|title=Black vinegar|date=2020-04-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_vinegar&oldid=950867267|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Formal seating order ===\nThere is a specific [[Seating plan|seating order]] to every [[formal dinner]], based on seniority and organizational hierarchy. The [[seat of honor]], reserved for the host or the oldest person, is usually the position in the center facing east or facing the entrance to the room. Guests with higher status then sit in close proximity to the seat of honor, while those with lower positions sit further away. The least pretigious seat is generally the one nearest to the kitchen entrance or service door.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internations.org/hong-kong-expats/guide/15908-culture-shopping-recreation/dining-in-hong-kong-etiquette-15914|title=Dining in Hong Kong: Etiquette|website=www.internations.org}}</ref>In a formal banquet hall of many tables, the main table is the one which situates furthest from the entrance. The tables on the left hand side of the main tables are, in order of importance, second, fourth, sixth and so on, and those on the right are third, fifth and seventh. Guests are seated according to their status and cohesion with the host of the banquet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cits.net/china-travel-guide/seating-arrangements-of-chinese-banquet.html|title=Seating Arrangements of Chinese Banquet - CITS|website=www.cits.net|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Sequencing of a meal==\nWide variations exist throughout China, but the vast majority of full-course dinners are very similar in terms of timing and dishes.\n\n===Beverages===\n[[File:Chinese teapot.JPG|thumb|right|An 18th century Chinese porcelain hand painted blue and white teapot]]\nHot tea is almost always provided, either in advance of the diners being seated or immediately afterward. It can be consumed at leisure throughout the meal. Hot or cold water is sometimes served, but tea is the default beverage. A verbal \"thank you\" ({{zh|s=\u8c22\u8c22|p=xiexie|labels=no}}) may be offered to the server pouring a refill or, if in the middle of a conversation where it would be rude to interrupt the speaker, the table may be [[Chinese tea culture#Finger tapping|tapped twice with two bent fingers]] instead.\n\n===Appetizers===\nAppetizers are the first items presented. Two or more small dishes are brought to the table, holding boiled unsalted peanuts, salted roasted peanuts, crispy fried noodles, or similar dishes. These may be consumed while ordering the main courses, or while waiting for other dishes to arrive.\n\n===Soup===\nA hot soup may be served as one of the dishes, usually near the beginning of the meal. For small meals, especially at home, it may replace the diners' beverage entirely.\n\n===Main courses===\n{{see also|Dim sum}}\nUnlike Western-style meals, there are usually multiple main dishes which are sampled by all the diners; usually there is one communally-shared dish ordered per person seated at a table. A celebratory event such as a graduation or wedding often features over ten dishes, often an odd number for good luck.\n \nWhite steamed rice is provided in small bowls and food is often placed over it, flavoring it with their sauces. The rice is consumed little by little along with the other dishes and not separately, unless the diner remains hungry after the last dish has been removed.\n\n===Final course===\nNear the end of the meal, a starchy, filling dish such as noodles, [[jiaozi|Chinese dumplings]], or ''[[baozi]]'' is sometimes served, to ensure that guests are fully satiated. In extremely formal settings, only a small amount of this final dish is taken by the diners, to avoid implying that the host was not sufficiently generous in planning the meal.\n\n===Dessert===\nInformal meals may not have a dessert course at all, or offer sweet foods that are particular favorites of the diners. Fresh fruit (often slices of citrus) or fresh or canned pineapple are often offered in restaurants.\n\nOther common desserts are [[tapioca]] or [[rice pudding]], or a hot or cold soup flavored with [[red bean soup|sweet red beans]]. Ice cream may be offered, often flavored with [[ginger]], [[Red bean ice|sweet red beans]], or a delicate tea.\n\n[[Fortune cookie]]s are rarely offered by authentic Chinese restaurants, even in North America where they were invented. They are considered a lightweight amusement, suitable for informal gatherings of close friends and family. Fancier restaurants may offer mints or occasionally chocolates as breath fresheners.\n\n==Manners and customs ==\nEating is a dominant aspect of [[Chinese culture]], and eating out is one of the most common ways to honor guests, socialize, and deepen friendships.<ref name=\"Dob\">Dobsons, Richard. ''China Cycle'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwBFSfy_f0C&pg=RA1-PA20 p. 20]. 2006. 8 Feb 2010.</ref>\n\nProper [[etiquette]] is very important to traditional Chinese people, who feel good manners invite [[luck]], but boorish conduct brings [[shame]]. Although many [[Mao Zedong|Maoist]] programs tried to curtail traditional social practices, today table etiquette is again taken as an indication of educational status and good upbringing. For example, a child misusing their chopsticks at a formal dinner might embarrass their family, who are responsible for teaching the child.<ref name=\"Dob\"/><ref name=\"Cha\"/>\n\n===Personal behavior===\n{{See also|Eating utensil etiquette}}\nSince [[chopsticks]] (and [[spoon]]s) are used in place of [[fork]]s and [[knives]], [[Chinese cuisine]] tends to serve dishes in bite-size pieces or employ cooking techniques that render dishes such as fish or ''[[hong shao rou]]'' soft enough to be picked apart easily.<ref name=\"Inn\">Inness, Sherrie. \"Home Cooking .\" Kitchen Culture in America: Popular Representations of Food, Gender, and Race (2001): 14.

One should not spear food with chopsticks although people sometimes do it if the food is too slippery. Chopsticks are not to be used to point at people, pick teeth, bang the bowls, move the bowls, nor to be chewed on or waved around. They should be held so that the ends are even, and never separated in any way (such as holding one in each hand). \n\nWhen not in use, chopsticks should be left on chopstick rests when provided, or placed across the bowl or plate. They should never be left sticking upright out of food, evoking images of incense or \"joss\" sticks used ceremoniously at funerals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture-4-travel.com/chopstick-etiquette.html|title=Chinese Chopstick Etiquette|work=Culture-4-Travel.com}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, a diner is supposed to hold the chopsticks in the right hand and with the left hand either hold down the bowl on the table or pick it up so that it is near the mouth, or at least put the left hand on the table; eating with the chopsticks in the left hand or steadily with only one hand on the table is perceived as unproper table manners.{{Why?|reason=Why is this perceived as rude behaviour? The fact that this way to handle food is traditionally claimed and perceived to be rude does not mean the perception is correct. There is no concrete evidence that this perception is correct, and that both hands should be used when eating is in fact no rule or law; perception is a more correct word.|date=February 2020}}{{Fix|text=reliable source??}}{{dubious|date=January 2020}} However, that perception has started to fade away in modern time.{{when?|date=March 2020}}{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} It is, however, never considered rude to lift a rice bowl with one hand to scoop rice into the mouth using chopsticks in the other hand.\n\nCondiments, such as [[soy sauce]], [[duck sauce]], or [[sesame oil]], are sometimes served in small shallow dishes to allow pieces of food to be dipped as desired. They may not be routinely provided at high-quality restaurants; the assumption is that perfectly-prepared food needs no condiments, and the quality of the food can be best appreciated as prepared by the master chef.\n\nIt is considered virtuous for diners to not leave any bit of wasted food on their plates or bowls. If significant amounts of untouched food are left over in the serving dishes after a meal, it is often considered a compliment to the chef to request that it be packaged for takeout, to be enjoyed later at home.\n\n===Inviting guests===\nAlthough individual households may have their own house rules, the Chinese traditions used to welcome guests are largely the same throughout the country.<ref name=\"Mor\">Morse, Edward.

In addition to providing opportunities for socializing, shared meals allow the diners to sample a wider range of dishes than if they were ordering individually.\n\n===Communal eating===\n[[File:Spoon and chopsticks.jpg|thumb|upright|Serving chopsticks (''gongkuai'') on the far right, personal chopsticks (''putongkuai'' or ''sikuai'') in the middle, and a spoon. Serving chopsticks are usually more ornate and longer than the personal ones.]]\nThere appears to be no Chinese word for communal eating and using one's personal chopsticks in the serving dish. However, at some formal meals, there may be pairs of communal serving chopsticks ({{lang|zh|\u516c\u7b77}}, ''gongkuai''). These are sets of chopsticks specifically for shared dishes only. Often, these will be distinct from the ''putongkuai'' ({{lang|zh|\u666e\u901a\u7b77}}, regular chopsticks) or ''sikuai'' ({{lang|zh|\u79c1\u7b77}}, personal chopsticks) in that they will be longer and more ornate. There will sometimes be one set of communal chopsticks per dish or one set per course. The ratio varies.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false 9][https://books.google.com/books?id=0TV8ebayzNUC&pg=PA26&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false 10][https://books.google.com/books?id=npxUXbUg6uUC&pg=PA164&dq=chopstick+manners&hl=en#v=onepage&q=chopsticks&f=false 11]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=32uyAAAAIAAJ&q=chopstick+etiquette&dq=chopstick+etiquette&hl=en 12]</ref> If there are no ''gongkuai'' set on the table, it is never rude to request that they be provided; others will just think that you are a stickler for formality and good manners.\n\nIt is also considered extremely rude to dig for a choice food morsel on the serving plate instead of picking up the piece that is closest to the diner, thus demonstrating fairness and sharing with others. The shunned practice is sometimes called \"digging one's grave\". Likewise, it is impolite to hoard or take most of a dish until it has been offered to everyone and the other diners have had a chance to sample it. For this reason, it is common to take a smaller amount from the dishes on the first round, and to keep the other diners in mind when taking a larger second helping.\n\nThe last piece of food on a communal dish is never served to oneself without asking for permission. When offered the last bit of food, it may sometimes be considered rude to refuse the offer.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}{{dubious|date=February 2020}} \n\n===Lazy Susan (turntable)===\n[[File:Lazy Susan.jpg|thumb|A Lazy Susan in use]]\nA [[Lazy Susan]] turntable is a large circular rotating platform placed at the center of a table, and used to easily share a large number of dishes among the diners. A Lazy Susan can be made from many materials, but most often they are constructed of glass, wood, or plastic.\n\nIt is typical for all the dishes for each course to be brought out together and placed around the perimeter of the Lazy Susan. It the turntable is large, a decorative centerpiece may occupy the center, since any food placed there would be out of reach of a seated diner. Alternatively, shared table condiments such as soy sauce, hot sauce, vinegar, or sesame oil may be located at the center.\n\nIf the dishes come out one at a time or if there is some special delicacy, they are typically served to the guest of honor first and then rotated clockwise around the table. The host will often wait to serve himself last. Dishes should typically not be removed from the Lazy Susan and placed on the table: at most, one should hold the dish aloft while serving and then return it to its place on the tray. One should try to avoid moving the Lazy Susan even slightly when someone is in the act of transferring food from the dishes to their plate or bowl. \n\n===Alcohol===\nWater and other non-alcoholic beverages may be consumed at any time. However, in formal settings, alcohol should only be consumed during [[toast (honor)|toasts]]. A modest toast may be followed by a single sip of wine or swallow of beer, but a ''baijiu'' toast is often ended with ''Ganbei!'' ({{lang|zh|\u5e72\u676f}}), an exhortation to drain the glass. Ideally, glasses are refilled immediately following a toast in preparation for the next.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn informal settings, individuals may order their preferred drinks. Carbonated beverages or beer are often ordered, although many diners may be satisfied with tea or hot water.\n\n==Bill (check)==\nThe bill for the meal (often call the \"check\") is presented at the end of the meal, after all the food and drinks have been served. In most restaurants in Chinese countries, there is no [[gratuity|tip]] expected unless it is explicitly posted. Usually if there is a tip required, it will already be added to the bill. However, in Chinese restaurants in North America tips are usually expected, as is customary in other restaurants of the region.\n\nIt is a common sight for families to dispute over who pays the bill, as the person paying thereby demonstrates generosity, sincerity, and dominance. If somebody organizes a meal and invites the guests, that person is usually accorded the honor of paying for the event.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Customs and etiquette in Japanese dining]]\n*[[Chinese culture|Culture of China]]\n*[[Chinese cuisine]]\n*[[Etiquette in Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n<!--\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 8]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 9]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=0TV8ebayzNUC&pg=PA26&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 10]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=npxUXbUg6uUC&pg=PA164&dq=chopstick+manners&hl=en#v=onepage&q=chopsticks&f=false Ref. 11 page 164]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=32uyAAAAIAAJ&q=chopstick+etiquette&dq=chopstick+etiquette&hl=en Ref. 12 page 69-71]\n-->\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/business/global/28iht-busnav28.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss In China, Social Evenings Are Considered Part of the Business Routine]\n* [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S2352618115000657/1-s2.0-S2352618115000657-main.pdf?_tid=698dab50-0114-4938-a7f6-58bddca2b29a&acdnat=1528346775_0fcf187161655a2b6fe6aeb18defa85f Food, eating behavior, and culture in Chinese society]\n* [http://confuciusmag.com/chinese-dining-etiquette Chinese dining etiquette]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chinese Table Manner}}\n[[Category:Etiquette by region|Chinese dining]]\n[[Category:Dining etiquette]]\n[[Category:Chinese cuisine]]\n", "name_user": "Punkpumpking", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBeverages:some manners about drinking tea to the guests and manners", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_and_etiquette_in_Chinese_dining"}

At dawn several enemy soldiers stole through the fog and flung a grenade into the middle of the team, who were spread in line by the trail, in sight of each other. The grenade exploded next to the front scout, Cpl. Richard E. Wilkie, showering him with shrapnel. As the enemy opened fire, the two team members on Wilkie's left panicked and fired in the direction of the grenade's blast. Caught in an intense crossfire, Wilkie, a Special Forces veteran, was shot five times\u2013\u2013once by the enemy, twice by his team, and twice by bullets that passed through him.

The grenade exploded next to the front scout, Cpl. Richard E. Wilkie, showering him with shrapnel. As the enemy opened fire, the two team members on Wilkie's left panicked and fired in the direction of the grenade's blast.
