He was a conventional [[court painter]] of portraits for three [[Holy Roman emperor]]s in Vienna and Prague, also producing religious subjects and, among other things, a series of coloured drawings of exotic animals in the imperial [[menagerie]]. He specialized in grotesque symbolical compositions of fruits, animals, landscapes, or various inanimate objects arranged into human forms.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford illustrated encyclopedia|date=1985-1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Judge, Harry George., Toyne, Anthony.|isbn=0-19-869129-7|location=Oxford [England]|pages=21|oclc=11814265}}</ref> The [[still-life]] portraits were clearly partly intended as whimsical curiosities to amuse the court, but critics have speculated as the degree of serious engagement with [[Renaissance Neo-Platonism]] or other intellectual currents that they have. \n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Vertumnus \u00e5rstidernas gud m\u00e5lad av Giuseppe Arcimboldo 1591 - Skoklosters slott - 91503.tiff|thumb|''[[Vertumnus (painting)|Vertumnus]]'', a portrait depicting [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] painted as [[Vertumnus]], the Roman god of the seasons, c. 1590\u201391.

He was also the court decorator and costume designer. [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]], who visited [[Vienna]] in 1570 and 1573, saw Arcimboldo's work and commissioned a copy of his ''The Four Seasons'' which incorporates his own monarchic [[symbol]]s.\n\nArcimboldo's conventional work, on traditional religious subjects, has fallen into oblivion, but his portraits of human heads made up of vegetables, plants, fruits, sea creatures and tree roots, were greatly admired by his contemporaries and remain a source of fascination today.\n\nAt a distance, his portraits looked like normal human portraits.  However, individual objects in each portrait were actually overlapped together to make various anatomical shapes of a human.  They were carefully constructed by his imagination.  The assembled objects in each portrait were not random: each was related by characterization.<ref>Maiorino, Giancarlo. ''The Portrait of Eccentricity: Arcimboldo and the Mannerist Grotesque.''  The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1991. Print.</ref>  In the portrait now represented by several copies called ''The Librarian'', Arcimboldo used objects that signified the book culture at that time, such as the curtain that created individual study rooms in a library.  The animal tails, which became the beard of the portrait, were used as dusters.  By using everyday objects, the portraits were decoration and still-life paintings at the same time.<ref name=\"Elhard, K. C 2005\">Elhard, K.

In ''The Librarian'', although the painting might have appeared ridiculous, it also contained a criticism of wealthy people who collected books only to own them, rather than to read them.<ref name=\"Elhard, K.

It was during this last phase of his career that he produced the composite portrait of Rudolph II (see above), as well as his self-portrait as the Four Seasons.  His Italian contemporaries honored him with poetry and manuscripts celebrating his illustrious career.\n\nWhen the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] army invaded [[Prague]] in 1648, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], many of Arcimboldo's paintings were taken from [[Rudolf II]]'s collection.\n\nHis works can be found in Vienna's [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] and the [[Ambras Castle|Habsburg Schloss Ambras]] in [[Innsbruck]]; the [[Louvre]] in Paris; as well as in numerous museums in Sweden. In Italy, his work is in [[Cremona]], [[Brescia]], and the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]]. The [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]]; the [[Denver Art Museum]] in [[Denver, Colorado]]; the Menil Foundation in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]; the Candie Museum in [[Guernsey]] and the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] in [[Madrid]] also own [[painting]]s by Arcimboldo.\n\nHe is known as a 16th-century [[Mannerist]].  A transitional period from 1520 to 1590, Mannerism adopted some artistic elements from the High Renaissance and influenced other elements in the Baroque period.  A Mannerist tended to show close relationships between human and nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/93691/the-mannerist-style-and-the-lamentation |title=The Mannerist Style and the Lamentation |publisher=Artsconnected.org |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref> Arcimboldo also tried to show his appreciation of nature through his portraits.  In ''The Spring'', the human portrait was composed of only various spring flowers and plants.  From the hat to the neck, every part of the portrait, even the lips and nose, was composed of flowers, while the body was composed of plants.  On the other hand, in ''The Winter'', the human was composed mostly of roots of trees.  Some leaves from evergreen trees and the branches of other trees became hair, while a straw mat became the costume of the human portrait.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn 1976, the Spanish sculptor [[Miguel Berrocal]] created the original bronze sculpture interlocking in 20 elements titled ''Opus 144 ARCIMBOLDO BIG'' as a homage to the Italian painter. This work was followed by the limited-edition sculpture in 1000 copies titled ''Opus 167 OMAGGIO AD ARCIMBOLDO (HOMAGE TO ARCIMBOLDO)'' of 1976\u20131979 consisting of 30 interlocking elements.\n\nThe works of Arcimboldo, especially his multiple [[image]]s and visual puns, were rediscovered in the early 20th century by [[Surrealist]] artists such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]. The exhibition entitled \"The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century\u201d at the [[Palazzo Grassi]] in [[Venice]] (1987) includes numerous 'double meaning' paintings. Arcimboldo's influence can also be seen in the work of [[Shigeo Fukuda]], [[Istv\u00e1n Orosz]], [[Octavio Ocampo]], [[Vic Muniz]], and Sandro del Prete, as well as the films of [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]].<ref>[Literature:''The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century''.

After the deaths of Arcimboldo and his patron\u2014the emperor Rudolph II\u2014the heritage of the artist was quickly forgotten, and many of his works were lost. They were not mentioned in the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries. Only in 1885 did the art critic K. Kasati publish the monograph \"Giuseppe Arcimboldi, Milan Artist\" in which the main attention was given to Arcimboldi's role as a portraitist.<ref name=\"Werner Kriegeskorte 2000 p. 30\">Werner Kriegeskorte (2000).

Taschen. p. 30. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref>\n\nWith the advent of [[surrealism]] its theorists paid attention to the formal work of Arcimboldo, and in the first half of the 20th century many articles were devoted to his heritage. Gustav Hocke [de] drew parallels between Arcimboldo, [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], and [[Max Ernst]]'s works. A volume monograph of B. Geyger and the book by F. Legrand and F. Xu were published in 1954.\n\nSince 1978 T. DaCosta Kaufmann was engaged in Arcimboldo's heritage, and wrote of the artist defending his dissertation \"Variations on an imperial subject\". His volume work, published in 2009, summed up the attitude of modern art critics towards Arcimboldo. An article published in 1980 by [[Roland Barthes]] was devoted to Arcimboldo's works.<ref name=\"Werner Kriegeskorte 2000 p. 30\"/>\n\nArchimboldo's relation with surrealism was emphasized at landmark exhibitions in New York (\"Fantastic art, [[dada]], [[surrealism]]\", 1937) and in Venice (\"Arcimboldo's Effect: Evolution of the person in painting from the XVI century\", Palazzo Grassi, 1987) where Arcimboldo's allegories were presented.{{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=15}} The largest encyclopedic exhibition of Arcimboldo's heritage, where about 150 of his works were presented, including graphics, was held in Vienna in 2008. In spite of the fact that very few works of Arcimboldo are available in the art market, their auction cost is in the range of five to 10 million dollars. Experts note that it is very modest for an artist at such a level of popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/arts/design/17vogel.html?_r=0|title=Arcimboldo Work Bought in Time for Exhibition|author=Carol Vogel|work=The New York Times|date= September 16, 2010|accessdate=2014-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/16/AR2010091606901.html|title=Arcimboldo's 'Four Seasons' will join National Gallery of Art collection|author= Blake Gopnik|work=Washington Post|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=2014-10-31}}</ref>\n\nArcimboldo's art heritage is badly identified, especially as it concerns his early works and pictures in traditional style. In total about 20 of his pictures remain, but many more have been lost, according to mentions of his contemporaries and documents of the era. His cycles ''Four Elements'' and ''Seasons'', which the artist repeated with little changes, are most known. Some of his paintings include ''[[The Librarian (painting)|The Librarian]]'', ''[[The Jurist (painting)|The Jurist]]'', ''The Cook'', ''Cupbearer'', and other pictures.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000).

Krigeskort, \"are absolutely unique\".<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> Attempts of interpretation begin with judgments of the cultural background and philosophy of the artist, however a consensus in this respect is not developed. B. Geyger, who for the first time raised these questions, relied mainly on judgments of contemporaries\u2014[[Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo|Lomazzo]], [[:it:Gregorio Comanini|Comanini]], and [[:it:Paolo Morigia|Morigia]], who used the terms \"scherzi, grilli, and capricci\" (respectively, \"jokes\", \"whims\", \"caprices\").{{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=15}} Geyger's monograph is entitled: \"Comic pictures of Giuseppe Arcimboldo\". Geyger considered the works of the artist as inversion, when the ugliness seems beautiful, or, on the contrary, as the disgrace exceeding the beauty, entertaining the regal customer.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 32\u201334. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> A similar point of view was stated by [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], but he reduced works of the artist to the theory of language, believing that fundamentals of Arcimboldo's art philosophy is linguistic, because without creating new signs he confused them by mixing and combining elements that then played a role in the innovation of language.<ref>Roland Barthes. Arcimboldo. p. 335</ref> \n\n<blockquote>Arcimboldo speaks double language, at the same time obvious and obfuscatory; he creates \"mumbling\" and \"gibberish\", but these inventions remain quite rational. Generally, the only whim (bizarrerie) which isn't afforded by Arcimboldo \u2013 he doesn't create language absolutely unclear \u2026 his art not madly.<ref>Roland Barthes. ''Arcimboldo''. p. 338</ref></blockquote>Arcimboldo's classification as [[Mannerism|mannerist]] also belongs to the 20th century. Its justification contains in Gustav Rehn Hok's work ''The world as a Labyrinth'', published in 1957. Arcimboldo was born in the late Renaissance, and his first works were done in a traditional Renaissance manner. In Hok's opinion, during the Renaissance era the artist had to be first of all the talented handicraftsman who skillfully imitated the nature, as the idea of fine art was based on its studying. [[Mannerism]] differed from the [[Renaissance]] art in attraction to \"not naturalistic abstraction\". It was a continuation of artistic innovation in the late Middle Ages\u2014art embodying ideas. According to G. Hok, in consciousness there is concetto\u2014the concept of a picture or a picture of the concept, an intellectual prototype. Arcimboldo, making a start from concetti, painted metaphorical and fantastic pictures, extremely typical for manneristic art.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 56\u201358. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> In ''[[On Ugliness]]'', which was published under [[Umberto Eco]]'s edition, Arcimboldo also admitted belonging to manneristic tradition for which \"...the preference for aspiration to strange, extravagant and shapeless over expressional fine\" is peculiar.<ref>''Storia della bruttezza'' (Bompiani, 2007 \u2013 English translation: ''On Ugliness'', 2007). p.169</ref>\n\nIn the work ''Arcimboldo and archimboldesk'', F. Legrand and F. Xu tried to reconstruct philosophical views of the artist. They came to a conclusion that the views represented a kind of [[Platonism|Platonic pantheism]]. The key to reconstruction of Arcimboldo's outlook seemed to them to be in the symbolism of court celebrations staged by the artist, and in his allegorical series. According to Plato's dialogues \"[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]\", an immemorial god created the Universe from chaos by a combination of four elements \u2013 fire, water, air and the earth, as defines all-encompassing unity.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 58\u201360. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref>\nIn T. Dakosta Kauffman's works serious interpretation of heritage of Arcimboldo in the context of culture of the 16th century is carried out consistently. Kauffman in general was skeptical about attribution of works by Arcimboldo, and recognized as undoubted originals only four pictures, those with a signature of the artist. He based the interpretation on the text of the unpublished poem by J. Fonteo \"The picture ''Seasons'' and ''Four Elements'' of the imperial artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo\". According to Fonteo, the allegorical cycles of Arcimboldo transfer ideas of greatness of the emperor. The harmony in which fruits and animals are combined into images of the human head symbolizes harmony of the empire under the good board of the Habsburgs. Images of seasons and elements are always presented in profile, but thus ''Winter'' and ''Water'', ''Spring'' and ''Air'', ''Summer'' and ''Fire'', ''Fall'' and ''Earth'' are turned to each other. In each cycle symmetry is also observed: two heads look to the right, and two \u2014 to the left. Seasons alternate in an invariable order, symbolizing both constancy of the nature and eternity of board of the Habsburgs' house. The political symbolics also hints at it: at the image of ''Air'' there are Habsburg symbols \u2014 a peacock and an eagle and ''Fire'' is decorated with a chain of the Award of the Golden Fleece, a great master of which by tradition was a head of a reigning dynasty. However it is made of flints and shod steel. Guns also point to the aggressive beginning. The Habsburg symbolics is present in the picture ''Earth'', where the lion's skin designates a heraldic sign of Bohemia. Pearls and corals similar to cervine horns in ''Water'' hint at the same. {{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=97\u2014101}}<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese.

Grotesque images in [[Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'' such as an immense fake nose recall his work. <ref> [[Frederick A. de Armas]], \"Nero's Golden House: Italian Art and the Grotesque in ''Don Quijote'', Part II,\" ''Cervantes: Bulletin of the Cervantes Society of America'' 24.1 (2004): 143-71.</ref> He also appears in the works of [[Francisco de Quevedo]].<ref> Margarita Levisi,\"Las figuras compuestas en Arcimboldo y Quevedo,\" ''Comparative Literature''20 (1968): 217-35.</ref> Turning to contemporary Hispanic literature, he appears in [[Roberto Bola\u00f1o]]'s ''2066.'' where he uses the painter's name for his main character.\n \nArcimboldo's painting ''Water'' was used as the cover of the 1973 album ''[[Masque (Kansas album)|Masque]]'' by the [[progressive rock]] band [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], and was also shown on the cover of the 1977 Paladin edition of [[Thomas Szasz]]'s ''[[The Myth of Mental Illness]]''.<ref>See the 1977 Paladin edition of ''The Myth of Mental Illness''</ref>\n\nThe 1992 novelette ''The Coming of Vertumnus'' by [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] counterpoints the innate surrealism of the eponymous work against a drug-induced altered mental state.\n\nIn [[Harry Turtledove]]'s 1993 fantasy detective novel, ''[[The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump]]'', the [[alternate history]]'s version of Arcimboldo incorporated [[imp]]s \u2013 a common, everyday sight in that world \u2013 along with fruit, books, etc., into his iconic portraits.\n\nThe logo of the ''[[Arkangel Shakespeare]]'' audiobooks, released from 1998 onwards, is a portrait of [[William Shakespeare]] made out of books, in the style of Arcimboldo's ''Librarian''.\n\nArcimboldo-style fruit people appear as characters in the films ''[[The Tale of Despereaux (film)|The Tale of Despereaux]]'' (2008) and ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'' (2016), as well as in the [[Cosmic Osmo]] video game series.\n\nArcimboldo's surrealist imagination is visible also in fiction.

He was also the court decorator and costume designer. [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]], who visited [[Vienna]] in 1570 and 1573, saw Arcimboldo's work and commissioned a copy of his ''The Four Seasons'' which incorporates his own monarchic [[symbol]]s.\n\nArcimboldo's conventional work, on traditional religious subjects, has fallen into oblivion, but his portraits of human heads made up of vegetables, plants, fruits, sea creatures and tree roots, were greatly admired by his contemporaries and remain a source of fascination today.\n\nAt a distance, his portraits looked like normal human portraits.  However, individual objects in each portrait were actually overlapped together to make various anatomical shapes of a human.  They were carefully constructed by his imagination.  The assembled objects in each portrait were not random: each was related by characterization.<ref>Maiorino, Giancarlo. ''The Portrait of Eccentricity: Arcimboldo and the Mannerist Grotesque.''  The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1991.

The animal tails, which became the beard of the portrait, were used as dusters.  By using everyday objects, the portraits were decoration and still-life paintings at the same time.<ref name=\"Elhard, K. C 2005\">Elhard, K.

It was during this last phase of his career that he produced the composite portrait of Rudolph II (see above), as well as his self-portrait as the Four Seasons.  His Italian contemporaries honored him with poetry and manuscripts celebrating his illustrious career.\n\nWhen the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] army invaded [[Prague]] in 1648, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], many of Arcimboldo's paintings were taken from [[Rudolf II]]'s collection.\n\nHis works can be found in Vienna's [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] and the [[Ambras Castle|Habsburg Schloss Ambras]] in [[Innsbruck]]; the [[Louvre]] in Paris; as well as in numerous museums in Sweden. In Italy, his work is in [[Cremona]], [[Brescia]], and the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]]. The [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]]; the [[Denver Art Museum]] in [[Denver, Colorado]]; the Menil Foundation in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]; the Candie Museum in [[Guernsey]] and the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] in [[Madrid]] also own [[painting]]s by Arcimboldo.\n\nHe is known as a 16th-century [[Mannerist]].  A transitional period from 1520 to 1590, Mannerism adopted some artistic elements from the High Renaissance and influenced other elements in the Baroque period.  A Mannerist tended to show close relationships between human and nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/93691/the-mannerist-style-and-the-lamentation |title=The Mannerist Style and the Lamentation |publisher=Artsconnected.org |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref> Arcimboldo also tried to show his appreciation of nature through his portraits.  In ''The Spring'', the human portrait was composed of only various spring flowers and plants.  From the hat to the neck, every part of the portrait, even the lips and nose, was composed of flowers, while the body was composed of plants.  On the other hand, in ''The Winter'', the human was composed mostly of roots of trees.  Some leaves from evergreen trees and the branches of other trees became hair, while a straw mat became the costume of the human portrait.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn 1976, the Spanish sculptor [[Miguel Berrocal]] created the original bronze sculpture interlocking in 20 elements titled ''Opus 144 ARCIMBOLDO BIG'' as a homage to the Italian painter. This work was followed by the limited-edition sculpture in 1000 copies titled ''Opus 167 OMAGGIO AD ARCIMBOLDO (HOMAGE TO ARCIMBOLDO)'' of 1976\u20131979 consisting of 30 interlocking elements.\n\nThe works of Arcimboldo, especially his multiple [[image]]s and visual puns, were rediscovered in the early 20th century by [[Surrealist]] artists such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]. The exhibition entitled \"The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century\u201d at the [[Palazzo Grassi]] in [[Venice]] (1987) includes numerous 'double meaning' paintings. Arcimboldo's influence can also be seen in the work of [[Shigeo Fukuda]], [[Istv\u00e1n Orosz]], [[Octavio Ocampo]], [[Vic Muniz]], and Sandro del Prete, as well as the films of [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]].<ref>[Literature:''The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century''.

After the deaths of Arcimboldo and his patron\u2014the emperor Rudolph II\u2014the heritage of the artist was quickly forgotten, and many of his works were lost. They were not mentioned in the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries. Only in 1885 did the art critic K. Kasati publish the monograph \"Giuseppe Arcimboldi, Milan Artist\" in which the main attention was given to Arcimboldi's role as a portraitist.<ref name=\"Werner Kriegeskorte 2000 p. 30\">Werner Kriegeskorte (2000).

Gustav Hocke [de] drew parallels between Arcimboldo, [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], and [[Max Ernst]]'s works. A volume monograph of B. Geyger and the book by F. Legrand and F. Xu were published in 1954.\n\nSince 1978 T. DaCosta Kaufmann was engaged in Arcimboldo's heritage, and wrote of the artist defending his dissertation \"Variations on an imperial subject\". His volume work, published in 2009, summed up the attitude of modern art critics towards Arcimboldo. An article published in 1980 by [[Roland Barthes]] was devoted to Arcimboldo's works.<ref name=\"Werner Kriegeskorte 2000 p. 30\"/>\n\nArchimboldo's relation with surrealism was emphasized at landmark exhibitions in New York (\"Fantastic art, [[dada]], [[surrealism]]\", 1937) and in Venice (\"Arcimboldo's Effect: Evolution of the person in painting from the XVI century\", Palazzo Grassi, 1987) where Arcimboldo's allegories were presented.{{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=15}} The largest encyclopedic exhibition of Arcimboldo's heritage, where about 150 of his works were presented, including graphics, was held in Vienna in 2008. In spite of the fact that very few works of Arcimboldo are available in the art market, their auction cost is in the range of five to 10 million dollars. Experts note that it is very modest for an artist at such a level of popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/arts/design/17vogel.html?_r=0|title=Arcimboldo Work Bought in Time for Exhibition|author=Carol Vogel|work=The New York Times|date= September 16, 2010|accessdate=2014-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/16/AR2010091606901.html|title=Arcimboldo's 'Four Seasons' will join National Gallery of Art collection|author= Blake Gopnik|work=Washington Post|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=2014-10-31}}</ref>\n\nArcimboldo's art heritage is badly identified, especially as it concerns his early works and pictures in traditional style. In total about 20 of his pictures remain, but many more have been lost, according to mentions of his contemporaries and documents of the era. His cycles ''Four Elements'' and ''Seasons'', which the artist repeated with little changes, are most known. Some of his paintings include ''[[The Librarian (painting)|The Librarian]]'', ''[[The Jurist (painting)|The Jurist]]'', ''The Cook'', ''Cupbearer'', and other pictures.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese.

Krigeskort, \"are absolutely unique\".<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> Attempts of interpretation begin with judgments of the cultural background and philosophy of the artist, however a consensus in this respect is not developed. B. Geyger, who for the first time raised these questions, relied mainly on judgments of contemporaries\u2014[[Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo|Lomazzo]], [[:it:Gregorio Comanini|Comanini]], and [[:it:Paolo Morigia|Morigia]], who used the terms \"scherzi, grilli, and capricci\" (respectively, \"jokes\", \"whims\", \"caprices\").{{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=15}} Geyger's monograph is entitled: \"Comic pictures of Giuseppe Arcimboldo\". Geyger considered the works of the artist as inversion, when the ugliness seems beautiful, or, on the contrary, as the disgrace exceeding the beauty, entertaining the regal customer.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 32\u201334. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> A similar point of view was stated by [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], but he reduced works of the artist to the theory of language, believing that fundamentals of Arcimboldo's art philosophy is linguistic, because without creating new signs he confused them by mixing and combining elements that then played a role in the innovation of language.<ref>Roland Barthes. Arcimboldo. p. 335</ref> \n\n<blockquote>Arcimboldo speaks double language, at the same time obvious and obfuscatory; he creates \"mumbling\" and \"gibberish\", but these inventions remain quite rational. Generally, the only whim (bizarrerie) which isn't afforded by Arcimboldo \u2013 he doesn't create language absolutely unclear \u2026 his art not madly.<ref>Roland Barthes. ''Arcimboldo''. p. 338</ref></blockquote>Arcimboldo's classification as [[Mannerism|mannerist]] also belongs to the 20th century. Its justification contains in Gustav Rehn Hok's work ''The world as a Labyrinth'', published in 1957. Arcimboldo was born in the late Renaissance, and his first works were done in a traditional Renaissance manner. In Hok's opinion, during the Renaissance era the artist had to be first of all the talented handicraftsman who skillfully imitated the nature, as the idea of fine art was based on its studying. [[Mannerism]] differed from the [[Renaissance]] art in attraction to \"not naturalistic abstraction\". It was a continuation of artistic innovation in the late Middle Ages\u2014art embodying ideas. According to G. Hok, in consciousness there is concetto\u2014the concept of a picture or a picture of the concept, an intellectual prototype. Arcimboldo, making a start from concetti, painted metaphorical and fantastic pictures, extremely typical for manneristic art.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 56\u201358. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> In ''[[On Ugliness]]'', which was published under [[Umberto Eco]]'s edition, Arcimboldo also admitted belonging to manneristic tradition for which \"...the preference for aspiration to strange, extravagant and shapeless over expressional fine\" is peculiar.<ref>''Storia della bruttezza'' (Bompiani, 2007 \u2013 English translation: ''On Ugliness'', 2007). p.169</ref>\n\nIn the work ''Arcimboldo and archimboldesk'', F. Legrand and F. Xu tried to reconstruct philosophical views of the artist. They came to a conclusion that the views represented a kind of [[Platonism|Platonic pantheism]]. The key to reconstruction of Arcimboldo's outlook seemed to them to be in the symbolism of court celebrations staged by the artist, and in his allegorical series. According to Plato's dialogues \"[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]\", an immemorial god created the Universe from chaos by a combination of four elements \u2013 fire, water, air and the earth, as defines all-encompassing unity.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 58\u201360. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref>\nIn T. Dakosta Kauffman's works serious interpretation of heritage of Arcimboldo in the context of culture of the 16th century is carried out consistently. Kauffman in general was skeptical about attribution of works by Arcimboldo, and recognized as undoubted originals only four pictures, those with a signature of the artist. He based the interpretation on the text of the unpublished poem by J. Fonteo \"The picture ''Seasons'' and ''Four Elements'' of the imperial artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo\". According to Fonteo, the allegorical cycles of Arcimboldo transfer ideas of greatness of the emperor. The harmony in which fruits and animals are combined into images of the human head symbolizes harmony of the empire under the good board of the Habsburgs. Images of seasons and elements are always presented in profile, but thus ''Winter'' and ''Water'', ''Spring'' and ''Air'', ''Summer'' and ''Fire'', ''Fall'' and ''Earth'' are turned to each other. In each cycle symmetry is also observed: two heads look to the right, and two \u2014 to the left. Seasons alternate in an invariable order, symbolizing both constancy of the nature and eternity of board of the Habsburgs' house. The political symbolics also hints at it: at the image of ''Air'' there are Habsburg symbols \u2014 a peacock and an eagle and ''Fire'' is decorated with a chain of the Award of the Golden Fleece, a great master of which by tradition was a head of a reigning dynasty. However it is made of flints and shod steel. Guns also point to the aggressive beginning. The Habsburg symbolics is present in the picture ''Earth'', where the lion's skin designates a heraldic sign of Bohemia. Pearls and corals similar to cervine horns in ''Water'' hint at the same. {{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=97\u2014101}}<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese.

Grotesque images in [[Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'' such as an immense fake nose recall his work. <ref> [[Frederick A. de Armas]], \"Nero's Golden House: Italian Art and the Grotesque in ''Don Quijote'', Part II,\" ''Cervantes: Bulletin of the Cervantes Society of America'' 24.1 (2004): 143-71.</ref> He also appears in the works of [[Francisco de Quevedo]].<ref> Margarita Levisi,\"Las figuras compuestas en Arcimboldo y Quevedo,\" ''Comparative Literature''20 (1968): 217-35.</ref> Turning to contemporary Hispanic literature, he appears in [[Roberto Bola\u00f1o]]'s ''2066.'' where he uses the painter's name for his main character.\n \nArcimboldo's painting ''Water'' was used as the cover of the 1973 album ''[[Masque (Kansas album)|Masque]]'' by the [[progressive rock]] band [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], and was also shown on the cover of the 1977 Paladin edition of [[Thomas Szasz]]'s ''[[The Myth of Mental Illness]]''.<ref>See the 1977 Paladin edition of ''The Myth of Mental Illness''</ref>\n\nThe 1992 novelette ''The Coming of Vertumnus'' by [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] counterpoints the innate surrealism of the eponymous work against a drug-induced altered mental state.\n\nIn [[Harry Turtledove]]'s 1993 fantasy detective novel, ''[[The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump]]'', the [[alternate history]]'s version of Arcimboldo incorporated [[imp]]s \u2013 a common, everyday sight in that world \u2013 along with fruit, books, etc., into his iconic portraits.\n\nThe logo of the ''[[Arkangel Shakespeare]]'' audiobooks, released from 1998 onwards, is a portrait of [[William Shakespeare]] made out of books, in the style of Arcimboldo's ''Librarian''.\n\nArcimboldo-style fruit people appear as characters in the films ''[[The Tale of Despereaux (film)|The Tale of Despereaux]]'' (2008) and ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'' (2016), as well as in the [[Cosmic Osmo]] video game series.\n\nArcimboldo's surrealist imagination is visible also in fiction.

After that time, there will be a swap, with Gantz becoming prime minister. However, should Netanyahu leave the premiership early, Gantz will take over the role. Several watchdog groups in Israel reacted to the news by petitioning the Supreme Court to block the formation of the government due to the indictment of Netanyahu.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/a-joint-meeting-between-netanyahu-and-gantz-to-start-soon-625241|title=After 17-month stalemate, Netanyahu and Gantz strike unity deal|website=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|access-date=20 April 2020|date=20 April 2020|author=Gil Hoffman}}</ref> The US Ambassador to Israel, [[David M.

The aircraft took off from Addis Ababa at 08:38 [[East Africa Time|local time]] (05:38 [[coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) with 149 passengers and 8 crew on board.<ref name=National /> One minute into the flight, the first officer, acting on the instructions of the captain, reported a \"flight control\" problem to the control tower. Two minutes into the flight, the plane's [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System|MCAS]] system activated, pitching the plane into a dive toward the ground. The pilots struggled to control it and managed to prevent the nose from diving further, but the plane continued to lose altitude. The MCAS then activated again, dropping the nose even further down. The pilots then flipped a pair of switches to disable the electrical [[trim tab]] system, which also disabled the MCAS software. However, in shutting off the electrical trim system, they also shut off their ability to trim the [[stabilizer (aeronautics)|stabilizer]] into a neutral position with the electrical switch located on their [[yoke (aeronautics)|yokes]]. The only other possible way to move the stabilizer would be by cranking the wheel by hand, but because the stabilizer was located opposite to the [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]], strong aerodynamic forces were pushing on it. As the pilots had inadvertently left the engines on full takeoff power, which caused the plane to accelerate at high speed, there was further pressure on the stabilizer. The pilots' attempts to manually crank the stabilizer back into position failed. Three minutes into the flight, with the aircraft continuing to lose altitude and accelerating beyond its safety limits, the captain instructed the first officer to request permission from air traffic control to return to the airport. Permission was granted, and the air traffic controllers diverted other approaching flights. Following instructions from air traffic control, they turned the aircraft to the east, and it rolled to the right. The right wing came to point down as the turn steepened. At 8:43, having struggled to keep the plane's nose from diving further by manually pulling the yoke, the captain asked the first officer to help him, and turned the electrical trim tab system back on in the hope that it would allow him to put the stabilizer back into neutral trim.

The aircraft took off from Addis Ababa at 08:38 [[East Africa Time|local time]] (05:38 [[coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) with 149 passengers and 8 crew on board.<ref name=National /> One minute into the flight, the first officer, acting on the instructions of the captain, reported a \"flight control\" problem to the control tower. Two minutes into the flight, the plane's [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System|MCAS]] system activated, pitching the plane into a dive toward the ground. The pilots struggled to control it and managed to prevent the nose from diving further, but the plane continued to lose altitude. The MCAS then activated again, dropping the nose even further down. The pilots then flipped a pair of switches to disable the electrical [[trim tab]] system, which also disabled the MCAS software. However, in shutting off the electrical trim system, they also shut off their ability to trim the [[stabilizer (aeronautics)|stabilizer]] into a neutral position with the electrical switch located on their [[yoke (aeronautics)|yokes]]. The only other possible way to move the stabilizer would be by cranking the wheel by hand, but because the stabilizer was located opposite to the [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]], strong aerodynamic forces were pushing on it. As the pilots had inadvertently left the engines on full takeoff power, which caused the plane to accelerate at high speed, there was further pressure on the stabilizer. The pilots' attempts to manually crank the stabilizer back into position failed. Three minutes into the flight, with the aircraft continuing to lose altitude and accelerating beyond its safety limits, the captain instructed the first officer to request permission from air traffic control to return to the airport. Permission was granted, and the air traffic controllers diverted other approaching flights. Following instructions from air traffic control, they turned the aircraft to the east, and it rolled to the right. The right wing came to point down as the turn steepened. At 8:43, having struggled to keep the plane's nose from diving further by manually pulling the yoke, the captain asked the first officer to help him, and turned the electrical trim tab system back on in the hope that it would allow him to put the stabilizer back into neutral trim. However, in turning the trim system back on, he also reactivated the MCAS system, which pushed the nose further down.

Strikebreakers are usually individuals who were not employed by the company prior to the [[trade union]] dispute, but rather hired after or during the strike to keep the organization running.  \"Strikebreakers\" may also refer to workers (union members or not) who cross [[picketing (protest)|picket line]]s to work.\n\n[[File:I.W.W. \"stickerette\" or \"silent agitator\".tif|thumb|[[Industrial Workers of the World]] stickerette \"Don't Scab\"]]\n[[File:I.W.W. stickerette - SCAB.jpg|thumb|[[Industrial Workers of the World]] stickerette - \"SCAB\"]]\n\nThe use of strikebreakers is a worldwide phenomenon; however, many countries have passed laws outlawing their use, as they undermine the collective bargaining process.  Strikebreakers are used far more frequently in the [[United States]] than in any other industrialized country.<ref>Norwood, ''Strikebreaking and Intimidation,'' 2002.</ref>\n\n==International law==\n{{Wiktionary|strikebreaker}}\nThe right to strike is not expressly mentioned in any convention of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO);<ref name=\"HRW\" /> however, the ILO's Freedom of Association Committee established principles on the right to strike through ongoing rulings.<ref>[http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/publication/wcms_087987.pdf ILO principles concerning the right to strike] 2000 {{ISBN|92-2-111627-1}}</ref> Among human rights treaties, only the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] contains a clause protecting the right to strike. However, like the Social Charter of 1961, the Covenant permits each signatory country to abridge the right to strike.<ref>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 8 (4).</ref>\n\nThe ILO Committee on Freedom of Association and other ILO bodies have, however, interpreted all core ILO conventions as protecting the right to strike as an essential element of the [[freedom of association]]. For example, the ILO has ruled that \"the right to strike is an intrinsic corollary of the right of association protected by Convention No. 87.\"<ref name=\"ILO1994\">International Labour Organization, ''Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining: General Survey of the Reports...'' 1994.</ref>\n\nThe ILO has also concluded striker replacement, while not in contravention of ILO agreements, carries with it significant risks for abuse and places trade union freedoms \"in grave jeopardy.\"<ref name=\"ILO1994\" /><ref>Committee on Freedom of Association, ''Digest of Decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association,'' 2006.</ref>\n\nThe [[European Social Charter]] of 1961 was the first international agreement to expressly protect the right to strike.<ref name=\"HRW\">Human Rights Watch, ''Unfair Advantage: Workers' Freedom of Association in the United States Under International Human Rights Standards,'' 2000.</ref>  However, the [[European Union]]'s [[Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers]] permits EU member states to regulate the right to strike.<ref name=\"MTEUPASP\">Maastricht Treaty on European Union, Protocol and Agreement on Social Policy, February 7, 1992, 31 LL.M. 247, paragraph 13 under \"Freedom of association and collective bargaining.\"</ref>\n\n==National laws==\n[[Image:Chicago Tribune 1986 strikebreakers.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Strikebreakers outside the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' during a 1986 strike]]\n\n===Asia===\n*[[Japanese labor law]] significantly restricts the ability of both an employer and a union to engage in labor disputes. The  law highly regulates labor relations to ensure labor peace and channel conflict into collective bargaining, mediation and arbitration. It bans the use of strikebreakers.<ref>Sugeno and Kanowitz, ''Japanese Employment and Labor Law,'' 2002; Dau-Schmidt, \"Labor Law and Industrial Peace: A Comparative Analysis of the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan Under the Bargaining Model,\" ''Tulane Journal of International & Comparative Law,'' 2000.</ref>\n*[[South Korea]] bans the use of strikebreakers, although the practice remains common.<ref>Parry, \"Labour Law Draws Roar of Rage From Asian Tiger,\" ''The Independent,'' January 18, 1997.</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nIn most European countries, strikebreakers are rarely used. Consequently, they are rarely if ever mentioned in most European national labor laws.<ref name=\"HRW\" /> As mentioned above, it is left to the [[European Union]] member states to determine their own policies.<ref name=\"MTEUPASP\"/>\n\n*[[Germany]] has employment law that strongly protects worker rights, but trade unions and the right to strike are not regulated by statute. The Bundesarbeitsgericht (the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany]]) and the Bundesverfassungsgericht (the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]]) have, however, issued a large number of rulings which essentially regulate trade union activities such as strikes. Work councils, for example, may not strike at all, but trade unions retain an almost unlimited ability to strike. The widespread use of work councils, however, channels most labor disputes and reduces the likelihood of strikes. Recent efforts to enact a comprehensive federal labor relations law that regulates strikes, lockouts and the use of strikebreakers failed.<ref>K\u00f6rner, \"German Labor Law in Transition,\" ''German Law Journal,'' April 2005; Westfall and Thusing, \"Strikes and Lockouts in Germany and Under Federal Legislation in the United States: A Comparative Analysis,\" ''Boston College International & Comparative Law Review,'' 1999.</ref>\n* [[United Kingdom]] laws permit strikebreaking, and courts have significantly restricted the right of unions to punish members who act as strikebreakers.<ref>Ewing, \"Laws Against Strikes Revisited,\" in ''Future of Labour Law,'' 2004.</ref>\n\n===North America===\n*[[Canada]] has federal industrial relations laws that strongly regulate the use of strikebreakers. Although many Canadian labor unions today advocate for even stronger regulations, scholars point out that Canadian labor law has far greater protections for union members and the right to strike than American labor law, which has significantly influenced the development of labor relations in Canada.<ref>Logan, \"How 'Anti-Union' Laws Saved Canadian Labour: Certification and Striker Replacements in Post-War Industrial Relations,\" ''Relations Industrielles/Industrial Relations,'' January 2002.</ref> In [[Quebec]], the use of strikebreakers is illegal,<ref>Quebec Labour Code Section 109.1</ref> but companies may try to remain open with only managerial personnel.<ref name=\"HRW\" />\n*[[Mexico]] has a federal labor law that requires companies to cease operations during a legal strike, effectively preventing the use of strikebreakers.<ref name=\"HRW\" />\n*The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] held in ''[[NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.]],'' [[case citation|304 U.S. 333]] (1938) that an employer may not discriminate on the basis of union activity in reinstating employees at the end of a strike. The ruling effectively encourages employers to hire strikebreakers so that the union loses majority support in the workplace when the strike ends.<ref>Getman and Kohler, \"The Story of ''NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.'',\" in ''Labor Law Stories,'' 2005, pp. 49-50.</ref> The ''Mackay'' Court also held that employers enjoy the unrestricted right to permanently replace strikers with strikebreakers.<ref>Getman and Kohler, \"The Story of ''NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.'',\" in ''Labor Law Stories,'' 2005, p. 13.</ref>\n\n==Synonyms==\nStrikebreaking is also known as \"black-legging\" or \"blacklegging\". American [[Lexicography|lexicographer]] Stephanie Smith suggests that the word has to do with [[Shoeshiner|bootblacking]] or [[shoe polish]], for an early occurrence of the word was in conjunction with an 1803 American bootmaker's strike.<ref>Smith, ''Household Words: Bloomers, Sucker, Bombshell, Scab, Nigger, Cyber'', p. 98.</ref> But British industrial relations expert J.G. Riddall notes that it may have a [[racism|racist]] connotation, as it was used in this way in 1859 in the United Kingdom: \"If you dare work we shall consider you as blacks...\"<ref>Riddall, p. 209.</ref> Lexicographer Geoffrey Hughes, however, notes that \"blackleg\" and \"scab\" are both references to disease, as in the [[Blackleg (disease)|blackleg]] infectious bacterial disease of sheep and cattle caused by ''[[Clostridium chauvoei]]''. He dates the first use of the term \"blackleg\" in reference to strikebreaking to the United Kingdom in 1859. The use of the term blackleg for a strikebreaker was, however, previously recorded in 1832 during the trial of special constable George Weddell for killing and slaying Cuthbert Skipsey, a striking pitman, near Chirton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.<ref>Tyne Mercury, 10 July 1832</ref> Hughes observes that the term was once generally used to indicate a scoundrel, a villain, or a disreputable person.<ref name=\"Hughes466\">Hughes, p. 466.</ref>  However, the [[Northumberland|Northumbrian]] folk song ''[[Blackleg Miner]]'' is believed to originate from the 1844 strike, which would predate Hughes's reference.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984-85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=21 December 2016|quote=The song, Blackleg Miner, is thought to originate from the 1844 Miners' Lockout in the North East Coalfield.|page=289}}</ref>  [[David John Douglass]] claims that the term ''blackleg''  has its origins in [[coal mining]], as strikebreakers would often neglect to wash their legs, which would give away that they had been working whilst others had been on strike.<ref name=\"StrikeNotTheEnd\">{{cite book|last1=Douglass|first1=David John|title=Strike, not the end of the story|publisher=National Coal Mining Museum for England|location=Overton, Yorkshire, UK|year=2005|page=2}}</ref>\n\nHughes notes that the use of the term \"scab\" can be traced back to the [[Elizabethan era]] in England, and is much more clearly rooted in the concept of disease (e.g., a diseased person) and a sickened appearance.<ref name=\"Hughes466\" />  The word is occasionally still used as a general insult in Britain; for example, during a mock funeral for [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013 in [[Goldthorpe]], the word \"scab\" was spelled out in flowers as part of the display.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-22183727 Goldthorpe hosts anti-Margaret Thatcher funeral]</ref>  A traditional English proverb, which advises against gossip, is ''He that is a blab is a scab''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Apperson |first1=George Latimer |last2=Manser |first2=Martin H |date=2007 |title=Dictionary of Proverbs |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |page=57|isbn=9781840223118}}</ref>\n\nJohn McIlroy has suggested that there is a distinction between a ''blackleg'' and a ''scab''.  He defines a ''scab'' as an outsider who is recruited to replace a striking worker, whereas a ''blackleg'' is one already employed who goes against a democratic decision of their colleagues to strike, and instead continues to work.<ref>McIlroy, John, Strike: How to fight and how to win, page 150 (London, 1984), quoted in {{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984-85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=21 December 2016|pages=293-4}}</ref>  The fact that McIlroy specified that this should be a \"democratic\" decision has led the historian David Amos to question whether the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|Nottinghamshire miners in 1984\u201385]] were true blacklegs, given the lack of a democratic vote on the strike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984-85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=21 December 2016|quote=If we use McIlroy's interpretation can the Nottinghamshire miners of 1984-85 be seen to have been 'blacklegging' as against 'scabbing'? However, there is one contentious point in McIlroy's interpretation, the breaking of the 'democratic process'. It is because there was some debate over the democratic process in the 1984-85 miners' strike that the question is raised as to whether the working Nottinghamshire miners were scabs at all.|page=294}}</ref>\n\nStrikebreakers are also known as \"knobsticks\". The term appears derived from the word \"knob\", in the sense of something that sticks out, and from the card-playing term \"nob\", as someone who cheats.{{sfn|Schillinger|2012|pages=104, 120}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Molly Maguires]]\n*[[Jack London#\"The Scab\"|\"The Scab\" by Jack London]] (attributed)\n*\"[[Blackleg Miner]]\" (song)\n*[[Mohawk Valley formula]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Committee on Freedom of Association.

Strikebreakers are usually individuals who were not employed by the company prior to the [[trade union]] dispute, but rather hired after or during the strike to keep the organization running.  \"Strikebreakers\" may also refer to workers (union members or not) who cross [[picketing (protest)|picket line]]s to work.\n\n[[File:I.W.W. \"stickerette\" or \"silent agitator\".tif|thumb|[[Industrial Workers of the World]] stickerette \"Don't Scab\"]]\n[[File:I.W.W. stickerette - SCAB.jpg|thumb|[[Industrial Workers of the World]] stickerette - SCAB]]\n\nThe use of strikebreakers is a worldwide phenomenon; however, many countries have passed laws outlawing their use, as they undermine the collective bargaining process.  Strikebreakers are used far more frequently in the [[United States]] than in any other industrialized country.<ref>Norwood, ''Strikebreaking and Intimidation,'' 2002.</ref>\n\n==International law==\n{{Wiktionary|strikebreaker}}\nThe right to strike is not expressly mentioned in any convention of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO);<ref name=\"HRW\" /> however, the ILO's Freedom of Association Committee established principles on the right to strike through ongoing rulings.<ref>[http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/publication/wcms_087987.pdf ILO principles concerning the right to strike] 2000 {{ISBN|92-2-111627-1}}</ref> Among human rights treaties, only the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] contains a clause protecting the right to strike. However, like the Social Charter of 1961, the Covenant permits each signatory country to abridge the right to strike.<ref>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 8 (4).</ref>\n\nThe ILO Committee on Freedom of Association and other ILO bodies have, however, interpreted all core ILO conventions as protecting the right to strike as an essential element of the [[freedom of association]]. For example, the ILO has ruled that \"the right to strike is an intrinsic corollary of the right of association protected by Convention No. 87.\"<ref name=\"ILO1994\">International Labour Organization, ''Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining: General Survey of the Reports...'' 1994.</ref>\n\nThe ILO has also concluded striker replacement, while not in contravention of ILO agreements, carries with it significant risks for abuse and places trade union freedoms \"in grave jeopardy.\"<ref name=\"ILO1994\" /><ref>Committee on Freedom of Association, ''Digest of Decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association,'' 2006.</ref>\n\nThe [[European Social Charter]] of 1961 was the first international agreement to expressly protect the right to strike.<ref name=\"HRW\">Human Rights Watch, ''Unfair Advantage: Workers' Freedom of Association in the United States Under International Human Rights Standards,'' 2000.</ref>  However, the [[European Union]]'s [[Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers]] permits EU member states to regulate the right to strike.<ref name=\"MTEUPASP\">Maastricht Treaty on European Union, Protocol and Agreement on Social Policy, February 7, 1992, 31 LL.M. 247, paragraph 13 under \"Freedom of association and collective bargaining.\"</ref>\n\n==National laws==\n[[Image:Chicago Tribune 1986 strikebreakers.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Strikebreakers outside the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' during a 1986 strike]]\n\n===Asia===\n*[[Japanese labor law]] significantly restricts the ability of both an employer and a union to engage in labor disputes. The  law highly regulates labor relations to ensure labor peace and channel conflict into collective bargaining, mediation and arbitration. It bans the use of strikebreakers.<ref>Sugeno and Kanowitz, ''Japanese Employment and Labor Law,'' 2002; Dau-Schmidt, \"Labor Law and Industrial Peace: A Comparative Analysis of the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan Under the Bargaining Model,\" ''Tulane Journal of International & Comparative Law,'' 2000.</ref>\n*[[South Korea]] bans the use of strikebreakers, although the practice remains common.<ref>Parry, \"Labour Law Draws Roar of Rage From Asian Tiger,\" ''The Independent,'' January 18, 1997.</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nIn most European countries, strikebreakers are rarely used. Consequently, they are rarely if ever mentioned in most European national labor laws.<ref name=\"HRW\" /> As mentioned above, it is left to the [[European Union]] member states to determine their own policies.<ref name=\"MTEUPASP\"/>\n\n*[[Germany]] has employment law that strongly protects worker rights, but trade unions and the right to strike are not regulated by statute. The Bundesarbeitsgericht (the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany]]) and the Bundesverfassungsgericht (the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]]) have, however, issued a large number of rulings which essentially regulate trade union activities such as strikes. Work councils, for example, may not strike at all, but trade unions retain an almost unlimited ability to strike. The widespread use of work councils, however, channels most labor disputes and reduces the likelihood of strikes. Recent efforts to enact a comprehensive federal labor relations law that regulates strikes, lockouts and the use of strikebreakers failed.<ref>K\u00f6rner, \"German Labor Law in Transition,\" ''German Law Journal,'' April 2005; Westfall and Thusing, \"Strikes and Lockouts in Germany and Under Federal Legislation in the United States: A Comparative Analysis,\" ''Boston College International & Comparative Law Review,'' 1999.</ref>\n* [[United Kingdom]] laws permit strikebreaking, and courts have significantly restricted the right of unions to punish members who act as strikebreakers.<ref>Ewing, \"Laws Against Strikes Revisited,\" in ''Future of Labour Law,'' 2004.</ref>\n\n===North America===\n*[[Canada]] has federal industrial relations laws that strongly regulate the use of strikebreakers. Although many Canadian labor unions today advocate for even stronger regulations, scholars point out that Canadian labor law has far greater protections for union members and the right to strike than American labor law, which has significantly influenced the development of labor relations in Canada.<ref>Logan, \"How 'Anti-Union' Laws Saved Canadian Labour: Certification and Striker Replacements in Post-War Industrial Relations,\" ''Relations Industrielles/Industrial Relations,'' January 2002.</ref> In [[Quebec]], the use of strikebreakers is illegal,<ref>Quebec Labour Code Section 109.1</ref> but companies may try to remain open with only managerial personnel.<ref name=\"HRW\" />\n*[[Mexico]] has a federal labor law that requires companies to cease operations during a legal strike, effectively preventing the use of strikebreakers.<ref name=\"HRW\" />\n*The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] held in ''[[NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.]],'' [[case citation|304 U.S. 333]] (1938) that an employer may not discriminate on the basis of union activity in reinstating employees at the end of a strike. The ruling effectively encourages employers to hire strikebreakers so that the union loses majority support in the workplace when the strike ends.<ref>Getman and Kohler, \"The Story of ''NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.'',\" in ''Labor Law Stories,'' 2005, pp. 49-50.</ref> The ''Mackay'' Court also held that employers enjoy the unrestricted right to permanently replace strikers with strikebreakers.<ref>Getman and Kohler, \"The Story of ''NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.'',\" in ''Labor Law Stories,'' 2005, p. 13.</ref>\n\n==Synonyms==\nStrikebreaking is also known as \"black-legging\" or \"blacklegging\". American [[Lexicography|lexicographer]] Stephanie Smith suggests that the word has to do with [[Shoeshiner|bootblacking]] or [[shoe polish]], for an early occurrence of the word was in conjunction with an 1803 American bootmaker's strike.<ref>Smith, ''Household Words: Bloomers, Sucker, Bombshell, Scab, Nigger, Cyber'', p. 98.</ref> But British industrial relations expert J.G. Riddall notes that it may have a [[racism|racist]] connotation, as it was used in this way in 1859 in the United Kingdom: \"If you dare work we shall consider you as blacks...\"<ref>Riddall, p. 209.</ref> Lexicographer Geoffrey Hughes, however, notes that \"blackleg\" and \"scab\" are both references to disease, as in the [[Blackleg (disease)|blackleg]] infectious bacterial disease of sheep and cattle caused by ''[[Clostridium chauvoei]]''. He dates the first use of the term \"blackleg\" in reference to strikebreaking to the United Kingdom in 1859. The use of the term blackleg for a strikebreaker was, however, previously recorded in 1832 during the trial of special constable George Weddell for killing and slaying Cuthbert Skipsey, a striking pitman, near Chirton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.<ref>Tyne Mercury, 10 July 1832</ref> Hughes observes that the term was once generally used to indicate a scoundrel, a villain, or a disreputable person.<ref name=\"Hughes466\">Hughes, p. 466.</ref>  However, the [[Northumberland|Northumbrian]] folk song ''[[Blackleg Miner]]'' is believed to originate from the 1844 strike, which would predate Hughes's reference.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984-85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=21 December 2016|quote=The song, Blackleg Miner, is thought to originate from the 1844 Miners' Lockout in the North East Coalfield.|page=289}}</ref>  [[David John Douglass]] claims that the term ''blackleg''  has its origins in [[coal mining]], as strikebreakers would often neglect to wash their legs, which would give away that they had been working whilst others had been on strike.<ref name=\"StrikeNotTheEnd\">{{cite book|last1=Douglass|first1=David John|title=Strike, not the end of the story|publisher=National Coal Mining Museum for England|location=Overton, Yorkshire, UK|year=2005|page=2}}</ref>\n\nHughes notes that the use of the term \"scab\" can be traced back to the [[Elizabethan era]] in England, and is much more clearly rooted in the concept of disease (e.g., a diseased person) and a sickened appearance.<ref name=\"Hughes466\" />  The word is occasionally still used as a general insult in Britain; for example, during a mock funeral for [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013 in [[Goldthorpe]], the word \"scab\" was spelled out in flowers as part of the display.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-22183727 Goldthorpe hosts anti-Margaret Thatcher funeral]</ref>  A traditional English proverb, which advises against gossip, is ''He that is a blab is a scab''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Apperson |first1=George Latimer |last2=Manser |first2=Martin H |date=2007 |title=Dictionary of Proverbs |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |page=57|isbn=9781840223118}}</ref>\n\nJohn McIlroy has suggested that there is a distinction between a ''blackleg'' and a ''scab''.  He defines a ''scab'' as an outsider who is recruited to replace a striking worker, whereas a ''blackleg'' is one already employed who goes against a democratic decision of their colleagues to strike, and instead continues to work.<ref>McIlroy, John, Strike: How to fight and how to win, page 150 (London, 1984), quoted in {{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984-85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=21 December 2016|pages=293-4}}</ref>  The fact that McIlroy specified that this should be a \"democratic\" decision has led the historian David Amos to question whether the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|Nottinghamshire miners in 1984\u201385]] were true blacklegs, given the lack of a democratic vote on the strike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984-85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=21 December 2016|quote=If we use McIlroy's interpretation can the Nottinghamshire miners of 1984-85 be seen to have been 'blacklegging' as against 'scabbing'? However, there is one contentious point in McIlroy's interpretation, the breaking of the 'democratic process'. It is because there was some debate over the democratic process in the 1984-85 miners' strike that the question is raised as to whether the working Nottinghamshire miners were scabs at all.|page=294}}</ref>\n\nStrikebreakers are also known as \"knobsticks\". The term appears derived from the word \"knob\", in the sense of something that sticks out, and from the card-playing term \"nob\", as someone who cheats.{{sfn|Schillinger|2012|pages=104, 120}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Molly Maguires]]\n*[[Jack London#\"The Scab\"|\"The Scab\" by Jack London]] (attributed)\n*\"[[Blackleg Miner]]\" (song)\n*[[Mohawk Valley formula]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Committee on Freedom of Association.

Northpointe created risk scales for general and violent recidivism, and for pretrial misconduct. According to the COMPAS Practitioner's Guide, the scales were designed using behavioral and psychological constructs \"of very high relevance to recidivism and criminal careers.\"{{sfn|Northpointe|2015|p=27}}\n\n* '''Pretrial Release Risk scale''': Pretrial risk is a measure of the potential for an individual to fail to appear and/or to commit new felonies while on release. According to the research that informed the creation of the scale, \"current charges, pending charges, prior arrest history, previous pretrial failure, residential stability, employment status, community ties, and substance abuse\" are the most significant indicators affecting pretrial risk scores.{{sfn|Northpointe|2015|p=27}}\n* '''General Recidivism scale''': The General Recidivism scale is designed to predict new offenses upon release, and after the COMPAS assessment is given. The scale uses an individual's criminal history and associates, drug involvement, and indications of juvenile delinquency.{{sfn|Northpointe|2015|p=26}}\n* '''Violent Recidivism scale''': The Violent Recidivism score is meant to predict violent offenses following release. The scale uses data or indicators that include a person's \"history of violence, history of non-compliance, vocational/educational problems, the person\u2019s age-at-intake and the person\u2019s age-at-first- arrest.\"{{sfn|Northpointe|2015|p=28}} An individual's risk score for violent recidivism is calculated as follows:<blockquote>Violent Recidivism Risk Score = (age\u2217\u2212w)+(age-at-first-arrest\u2217\u2212w)+(history of violence\u2217w) + (vocation education \u2217 w) + (history of noncompliance \u2217 w), where ''w'' is weight, the size of which is \"determined by the strength of the item\u2019s relationship to person offense recidivism that we observed in our study data.\"{{sfn|Northpointe|2015|p=29}}</blockquote>\n\n== Critiques and legal rulings ==\nIn July 2016, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that COMPAS risk scores can be considered by judges during sentencing, but there must be warnings given to the scores to represent the tool's \"limitations and cautions.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA general critique of the use of proprietary software such COMPAS is that since the algorithms it uses are [[trade secret|trade secrets]], they cannot be examined by the public and affected parties which may be a violation of due process.

Northpointe created risk scales for general and violent recidivism, and for pretrial misconduct. According to the COMPAS Practitioner's Guide, the scales were designed using behavioral and psychological constructs \"of very high relevance to recidivism and criminal careers.\"{{sfn|Northpointe|2015|p=27}}\n\n* '''Pretrial Release Risk scale''': Pretrial risk is a measure of the potential for an individual to fail to appear and/or to commit new felonies while on release. According to the research that informed the creation of the scale, \"current charges, pending charges, prior arrest history, previous pretrial failure, residential stability, employment status, community ties, and substance abuse\" are the most significant indicators affecting pretrial risk scores.{{sfn|Northpointe|2015|p=27}}\n* '''General Recidivism scale''': The General Recidivism scale is designed to predict new offenses upon release, and after the COMPAS assessment is given. The scale uses an individual's criminal history and associates, drug involvement, and indications of juvenile delinquency.{{sfn|Northpointe|2015|p=26}}\n* '''Violent Recidivism scale''': The Violent Recidivism score is meant to predict violent offenses following release. The scale uses data or indicators that include a person's \"history of violence, history of non-compliance, vocational/educational problems, the person\u2019s age-at-intake and the person\u2019s age-at-first- arrest.\"{{sfn|Northpointe|2015|p=28}} An individual's risk score for violent recidivism is calculated as follows:<blockquote>Violent Recidivism Risk Score = (age\u2217\u2212w)+(age-at-first-arrest\u2217\u2212w)+(history of violence\u2217w) + (vocation education \u2217 w) + (history of noncompliance \u2217 w), where ''w'' is weight, the size of which is \"determined by the strength of the item\u2019s relationship to person offense recidivism that we observed in our study data.\"{{sfn|Northpointe|2015|p=29}}</blockquote>\n\n== Critiques and legal rulings ==\nIn July 2016, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that COMPAS risk scores can be considered by judges during sentencing, but there must be warnings given to the scores to represent the tool's \"limitations and cautions.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA general critique of the use of proprietary software such COMPAS is that since the algorithms it uses are [[trade secret|trade secrets]], they cannot be examined by the public and affected parties which may be a violation of due process. Additionally, simple, transparent and more interpretable algorithms (such as [[linear regression]]) have been shown to perform predictions approximately as well as the COMPAS algorithm.<ref name=\"The Altantic\" /><ref>https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01701</ref><ref>Robin A.

Mu\u1e25ammad and Moses were similar to each other because they initiated the two prophetic chains; Jesus and Ghul\u0101m A\u1e25mad complete the divine scheme of things by terminating them. They must therefore also be similar. They resemble each other both in the circumstances of their appearance and in the nature of their prophetic mission. Both appeared when their respective communities were subject to foreign rule: the Jews under the Romans, and the Indian Muslims under the British. The religious conditions prevailing in their communities were also similar. The Jews were described in the Qur'\u0101n (1:7) as \"those who earned [divine] wrath\" (''al-magh\u1e0d\u016bb 'alayhim'') by their lack of religiosity and by rejecting the message of Jesus. Most Muslims of Ghul\u0101m A\u1e25mad's time can be described in similar terms: their spirituality is lost, and only rituals remain of their religion. Furthermore, they rejected Ghul\u0101m A\u1e25mad in the same way that the Jews had rejected Jesus. In addition to these similar circumstances, Ghul\u0101m A\u1e25mad's message resembles that of Jesus in two important characteristics: he does not advocate ''jih\u0101d'', and does not bring a new law, but strives rather to implement the ''shar\u012b'a'' promulgated by his predecessor in the prophetic office. And to make the affinity between the two chains total, Ghul\u0101m A\u1e25mad is spiritually greater than Jesus in the same way that Mu\u1e25ammad was greater than Moses\"</ref><ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Essence-4.pdf The Essence of Islam, Vol. IV, p. 33<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in fulfillment of Islam's latter day prophecies, as well as the [[Mujaddid]] (centennial reviver) of the 14th [[Islamic calendar|Islamic century]].<ref>Adil Hussain Khan.

After 1868, he returned to Qadian, as per his father's wishes, where he was entrusted to look after some estate affairs. During all this time, Ahmad was known as a social recluse because he would spend most of his time in seclusion studying religious books and praying in the local mosque. As time passed, he began to engage more with the Christian missionaries, particularly in defending Islam against their criticism. He would often confront them in public debates, especially the ones based in the town of [[Batala]].<ref>http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Life-of-Ahmad-20080411MN.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 1886, certain leaders of the [[Arya Samaj]] held discussion and debate with Ghulam Ahmad about the truthfulness of Islam and asked for a sign to prove that Islam was a living religion. In order to dedicate special prayers for this purpose and so as to seek further divine guidance, Ghulam Ahmad travelled to [[Hoshiarpur]] upon what he claimed was divine instruction. Here, he spent forty days in seclusion, a practice known as [[chilla-nashini]]. He travelled accompanied by three companions to the small two-storied house of one of his followers and was left alone in a room where his companions would bring him food and leave without speaking to him as he prayed and contemplated. He only left the house on Fridays and used an abandoned mosque for [[Jumu'ah]] (Friday prayers). It is during this period that he declared God had given him the glad tidings of an illustrious son.<ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/guidedone/?page=91 Ahmad, the Guided One], p. 91.</ref><ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000177.html Musleh Mau'ood, Khalifatul Masih II, in the Eyes of Non-Ahmadies], The Ahmadiyya Gazette, February 1997</ref>\n\n===Taking of the ''Bay'ah''===\n{{See also|Bay'ah (Ahmadiyya)|Ten Conditions of Bai'at}}\n[[File:Mirza Ghulam Ahmad group.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (seated centre) with some of his companions at [[Qadian]] c.1899]]\n\nGhulam Ahmad claimed divine appointment as a reformer as early as 1882 but did not take any pledge of allegiance or initiation. In December 1888, Ahmad announced that God had ordained that his followers should enter into a [[bay'ah]] with him and pledge their allegiance to him.

According to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the promised Mahdi was a symbolic reference to a spiritual leader and not a military leader in the person of Jesus Christ as is believed by many Muslims. With this proclamation, he also rejected the idea of armed [[Jihad (Ahmadiyya)|Jihad]] and argued that the conditions for such Jihad are not present in this age, which requires defending Islam by the pen and tongue but not with the sword.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Jihad-Brochure.pdf |title=Jihad Brochure |date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote two books named \"Tuhfa e qaisariah\" and \"Sitara e Qaisaria\" in which he invited Queen Victoria to embrace Islam and forsake Christianity.\n\n===Reaction of religious scholars===\n\nFollowing his claim to be the Promised Messiah and Mahdi, one of his adversaries prepared a [[Fatwa]] (decree) of disbelief against Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, declaring him a [[Kafir]] (disbeliever), a deceiver, and a liar. The decree permitted killing him and his followers. It was taken all around India and was signed by some two hundred religious scholars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/books/invitation/arg7.html |title=Argument 7: Defeat of Enemies |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome years later, a prominent Muslim leader and scholar, [[Ahmed Raza Khan]], was to travel to the [[Hejaz]] to collect the opinions of the religious scholars of Mecca and Madina.

The unanimous consensus of about thirty-four religious scholars was that Ghulam Ahmad's beliefs were blasphemous and tantamount to apostasy and that he must be punished by imprisonment and, if necessary, by execution.\n\n===Journey to Delhi===\n[[File:Jama Masjid, Delhi, watercolour, 1852.jpg|thumb|Jama Masjid, Delhi, 1852, [[William Carpenter (painter)|William Carpenter]]]]\n\nGhulam Ahmad went to [[Delhi]], which was at the time considered a centre of religious learning and home to many prominent religious leaders, in 1891, with the intention of distinguishing what he believed to be the truth from falsehood. He published an advertisement in which he invited the scholars to accept his claim and to engage in a public debate with him regarding the life and death of [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] (Jesus), particularly Maulana [[Syed Nazeer Husain]] (1805\u20131901), who was a leading religious scholar. He also proposed three conditions that were essential for such a debate: that there should be a police presence to maintain peace, the debate should be in written form (for the purpose of recording what was said), and that the debate should be on the subject of the death of Jesus.\n\nEventually, it was settled, and Ghulam Ahmad travelled to the [[Jama Masjid Delhi]] (main mosque) of Delhi accompanied by twelve of his followers, where some 5,000&nbsp;people were gathered. Before the debate started, there was a discussion on the conditions, which led to the conclusion that the debate should not be upon the death of Jesus, but upon the claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. He explained that his claim could only be discussed after the death of Jesus was proven, for Jesus was considered by many to be living and the one who will descend to Earth himself. Only when this belief was refuted could his claim to be the Messiah be discussed.\n\nUpon this, there was a clamour among the crowds, and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was informed that the other party alleged that he was at odds with Islamic beliefs and was a disbeliever; therefore, it was not proper to debate with him unless he clarified his beliefs. Ghulam Ahmad wrote his beliefs on a piece of paper and had it read aloud, but due to the clamour among the people, it could not be heard. Seeing that the crowd was drifting out of control and that violence was imminent, the police superintendent gave orders to disperse the audience, and the debate did not take place. A few days later, however, a written debate did take place between Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and Maulwi Muhammad Bashir of [[Bhopal]], which was later published.\n\nGhulam Ahmad is known to have travelled extensively across Northern India during this period of his life and to have held various debates with influential religious leaders.<ref name=\"life_of_ahmad\">{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Life-of-Ahmad-20080411MN.pdf |title=Life of Ahmad, Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement |date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Challenge to opponents===\nGhulam Ahmad published a book called ''The Heavenly Decree'', in which he challenged his opponents to a \"spiritual duel\" in which the question of whether someone was a Muslim or not would be settled by God based on the four criteria laid out in the Qur'an, namely, that a perfect believer will frequently receive glad tidings from God, that he will be given awareness about hidden matters and events of the future from God, that most of his prayers will be fulfilled and that he will exceed others in understanding novel finer points, subtleties and deeper meanings of the Qur'an.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/TheHeavenlyDecree.pdf |title=The Heavenly Decree |date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===The sun and moon eclipse===\nAfter announcing his claim to be the Messiah and Mahdi, his opponents demanded that he should produce the \"heavenly sign\" detailed in the tradition attributed to the 7th-century Imam [[Muhammad al-Baqir]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/15.html |title=A Brief History of Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam \u2013 Sign of the Eclipses |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> also known as Muhammad bin Ali, in which a certain sign is stated about the appearance of the [[Mahdi]]:\n\n{{Quote|For our Mahdi, there are two signs which have never happened since the earth and the heavens were created, i.e., the moon will be eclipsed on the first of the possible nights in the month of Ramadhan and the sun will be eclipsed in the middle of the possible days of the month of Ramadhan.|Dar Qutni Vol. 1, page 188<ref>{{cite web |title=Hadith on Imam Mahdi|url=https://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000202.html|website=alislam.org|accessdate=20 March 2015|quote=In Dar Qutni, the sign of the appearance of the Imam Mahdi is given in the following Hadith: 'For our Mahdi, there are two signs which have never happened since the earth and the heavens were created, i.e., the moon will be eclipsed on the first of the possible nights in the month of Ramadhan and the sun will be eclipsed in the middle of the possible days of the month of Ramadhan.'}}</ref>}}\n\nAhmadis maintain that this prophecy was fulfilled in 1894 and again in 1895, about three years after Ghulam Ahmad proclaimed himself to be the Promised Mahdi and Messiah, with the lunar and solar eclipse during the month of Ramadhan, according to the Ahmadiyya interpretation of the prophecy.

This episode is celebrated as one of the important events of the history of Ahmadiyya. The sermon was simultaneously written down by two of his companions and came to be known as the ''Khutba Ilhamiyya'', the revealed or inspired sermon. Ahmadiyya literature states that during this sermon, there was a change in his voice, he appeared as if in a [[trance]], in the grip of an unseen hand, and as if a voice from the unknown had made him its mouthpiece. After the sermon ended, Ahmad fell into [[Sujud#Sajdah of thankfulness|prostration]], followed by the rest of the congregation, as a sign of gratitude towards God.<ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000005.html Miraculous Knowledge of Arabic], The Review of Religions, July 1993</ref>\n\nAhmad wrote later:\n{{Quote|It was like a hidden fountain gushing forth and I did not know whether it was I who was speaking or an angel was speaking through my tongue.

After 1868, he returned to Qadian, as per his father's wishes, where he was entrusted to look after some estate affairs. During all this time, Ahmad was known as a social recluse because he would spend most of his time in seclusion studying religious books and praying in the local mosque. As time passed, he began to engage more with the Christian missionaries, particularly in defending Islam against their criticism. He would often confront them in public debates, especially the ones based in the town of [[Batala]].<ref>http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Life-of-Ahmad-20080411MN.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 1886, certain leaders of the [[Arya Samaj]] held discussion and debate with Ghulam Ahmad about the truthfulness of Islam and asked for a sign to prove that Islam was a living religion. In order to dedicate special prayers for this purpose and so as to seek further divine guidance, Ghulam Ahmad travelled to [[Hoshiarpur]] upon what he claimed was divine instruction. Here, he spent forty days in seclusion, a practice known as [[chilla-nashini]]. He travelled accompanied by three companions to the small two-storied house of one of his followers and was left alone in a room where his companions would bring him food and leave without speaking to him as he prayed and contemplated. He only left the house on Fridays and used an abandoned mosque for [[Jumu'ah]] (Friday prayers).

According to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the promised Mahdi was a symbolic reference to a spiritual leader and not a military leader in the person of Jesus Christ as is believed by many Muslims. With this proclamation, he also rejected the idea of armed [[Jihad (Ahmadiyya)|Jihad]] and argued that the conditions for such Jihad are not present in this age, which requires defending Islam by the pen and tongue but not with the sword.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Jihad-Brochure.pdf |title=Jihad Brochure |date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote two books named \"Tuhfa e qaisariah\" and \"Sitara e Qaisaria\" in which he invited Queen Victoria to embrace Islam and forsake Christianity.\n\n===Reaction of religious scholars===\nSome [[Ulema|religious scholars]] turned against him, and he was often branded as a heretic, but many [[Ulema|religious scholars]] praised him like [[Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]], [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]] among many others who praised him for his defense of [[Islam]]. After his death, opponents accused him of working for the British Government due to the termination of armed [[Jihad]], since his claims of being the Mahdi were made around the same time as the Mahdi of Sudan ([[Muhammad Ahmad]]).\n\nFollowing his claim to be the Promised Messiah and Mahdi, one of his adversaries prepared a [[Fatwa]] (decree) of disbelief against Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, declaring him a [[Kafir]] (disbeliever), a deceiver, and a liar. The decree permitted killing him and his followers. It was taken all around India and was signed by some two hundred religious scholars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/books/invitation/arg7.html |title=Argument 7: Defeat of Enemies |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome years later, a prominent Muslim leader and scholar, [[Ahmed Raza Khan]], was to travel to the [[Hejaz]] to collect the opinions of the religious scholars of Mecca and Madina.

The unanimous consensus of about thirty-four religious scholars was that Ghulam Ahmad's beliefs were blasphemous and tantamount to apostasy and that he must be punished by imprisonment and, if necessary, by execution.\n\n===Journey to Delhi===\n[[File:Jama Masjid, Delhi, watercolour, 1852.jpg|thumb|Jama Masjid, Delhi, 1852, [[William Carpenter (painter)|William Carpenter]]]]\n\nGhulam Ahmad went to [[Delhi]], which was at the time considered a centre of religious learning and home to many prominent religious leaders, in 1891, with the intention of distinguishing what he believed to be the truth from falsehood. He published an advertisement in which he invited the scholars to accept his claim and to engage in a public debate with him regarding the life and death of [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] (Jesus), particularly Maulana [[Syed Nazeer Husain]] (1805\u20131901), who was a leading religious scholar. He also proposed three conditions that were essential for such a debate: that there should be a police presence to maintain peace, the debate should be in written form (for the purpose of recording what was said), and that the debate should be on the subject of the death of Jesus.\n\nEventually, it was settled, and Ghulam Ahmad travelled to the [[Jama Masjid Delhi]] (main mosque) of Delhi accompanied by twelve of his followers, where some 5,000&nbsp;people were gathered. Before the debate started, there was a discussion on the conditions, which led to the conclusion that the debate should not be upon the death of Jesus, but upon the claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. He explained that his claim could only be discussed after the death of Jesus was proven, for Jesus was considered by many to be living and the one who will descend to Earth himself. Only when this belief was refuted could his claim to be the Messiah be discussed.\n\nUpon this, there was a clamour among the crowds, and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was informed that the other party alleged that he was at odds with Islamic beliefs and was a disbeliever; therefore, it was not proper to debate with him unless he clarified his beliefs. Ghulam Ahmad wrote his beliefs on a piece of paper and had it read aloud, but due to the clamour among the people, it could not be heard. Seeing that the crowd was drifting out of control and that violence was imminent, the police superintendent gave orders to disperse the audience, and the debate did not take place. A few days later, however, a written debate did take place between Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and Maulwi Muhammad Bashir of [[Bhopal]], which was later published.\n\nGhulam Ahmad is known to have travelled extensively across Northern India during this period of his life and to have held various debates with influential religious leaders.<ref name=\"life_of_ahmad\">{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Life-of-Ahmad-20080411MN.pdf |title=Life of Ahmad, Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement |date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Challenge to opponents===\nGhulam Ahmad published a book called ''The Heavenly Decree'', in which he challenged his opponents to a \"spiritual duel\" in which the question of whether someone was a Muslim or not would be settled by God based on the four criteria laid out in the Qur'an, namely, that a perfect believer will frequently receive glad tidings from God, that he will be given awareness about hidden matters and events of the future from God, that most of his prayers will be fulfilled and that he will exceed others in understanding novel finer points, subtleties and deeper meanings of the Qur'an.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/TheHeavenlyDecree.pdf |title=The Heavenly Decree |date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===The sun and moon eclipse===\nAfter announcing his claim to be the Messiah and Mahdi, his opponents demanded that he should produce the \"heavenly sign\" detailed in the tradition attributed to the 7th-century Imam [[Muhammad al-Baqir]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/15.html |title=A Brief History of Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam \u2013 Sign of the Eclipses |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> also known as Muhammad bin Ali, in which a certain sign is stated about the appearance of the [[Mahdi]]:\n\n{{Quote|For our Mahdi, there are two signs which have never happened since the earth and the heavens were created, i.e., the moon will be eclipsed on the first of the possible nights in the month of Ramadhan and the sun will be eclipsed in the middle of the possible days of the month of Ramadhan.|Dar Qutni Vol. 1, page 188<ref>{{cite web |title=Hadith on Imam Mahdi|url=https://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000202.html|website=alislam.org|accessdate=20 March 2015|quote=In Dar Qutni, the sign of the appearance of the Imam Mahdi is given in the following Hadith: 'For our Mahdi, there are two signs which have never happened since the earth and the heavens were created, i.e., the moon will be eclipsed on the first of the possible nights in the month of Ramadhan and the sun will be eclipsed in the middle of the possible days of the month of Ramadhan.'}}</ref>}}\n\nAhmadis maintain that this prophecy was fulfilled in 1894 and again in 1895, about three years after Ghulam Ahmad proclaimed himself to be the Promised Mahdi and Messiah, with the lunar and solar eclipse during the month of Ramadhan, according to the Ahmadiyya interpretation of the prophecy.

The sermon was simultaneously written down by two of his companions and came to be known as the ''Khutba Ilhamiyya'', the revealed or inspired sermon. Ahmadiyya literature states that during this sermon, there was a change in his voice, he appeared as if in a [[trance]], in the grip of an unseen hand, and as if a voice from the unknown had made him its mouthpiece. After the sermon ended, Ahmad fell into [[Sujud#Sajdah of thankfulness|prostration]], followed by the rest of the congregation, as a sign of gratitude towards God.<ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000005.html Miraculous Knowledge of Arabic], The Review of Religions, July 1993</ref>\n\nAhmad wrote later:\n{{Quote|It was like a hidden fountain gushing forth and I did not know whether it was I who was speaking or an angel was speaking through my tongue.

Ghulam Ahmad exchanged a series of letters with him between 1903 and 1907. Ghulam Ahmad challenged him to a prayer duel, where both would call upon God to expose the other as a false prophet. Ghulam Ahmad stated:\n{{Quote|The best way to determine whether Dowie's God is true or ours, is that Mr. Dowie should stop making prophecies about the destruction of all Muslims.

[[John Hugh Smyth-Pigott]] (1852-1927) proclaimed himself the Messiah and also claimed to be God while preaching in the Church known as \"The Ark of the Covenant\" in [[Upper Clapton|Clapton]] in London.

It can also mean that he would not believe in God or that what he has done by telling such a lie against God and planning against him, is not good.

Pigott then moved to [[Spaxton]], in [[Somerset]].\n\nResearchers have commented that after the move to Spaxton; {{Quote\n|the flamboyant Messiah of Clapton became the quiet, gentle pastor at Spaxton|Donald McCormick |The Temple of Love, 1962, p. 97, The Citadel Press, New York\n}}\nand that:\n\n{{Quote\n|Smyth-Pigott had learned his lesson at Clapton, that the opinion of the outside world still counted and he had no desire to face in Somersetshire the kind of demonstrations he had endured in London ...

In April 1908, he travelled to Lahore with his family and companions. Here, he gave many lectures.
