The unique archaeological complex found by a small group of Soviet scientists led by archaeologist [[Kimal Akishev|Kemal Akishevich Akishev]] in 1969. This is the place where found [[The Golden Man]] between 1969 and 1970 years. \u00abThe Golden man\u00bb is the remains of a Saks warrior in Golden clothing. \nThe burial ground consists of 45 large Royal mounds with a diameter of 30 to 90 and a height of 4 to 15 meters. The Issyk barrow is located in the Western half of the burial ground. Its diameter is 60 meters and its height is 6 meters.\n\nThere were found two burials \u2013 the Central one and the Southern (the side). Unfortunately, the Central burial site robbed. The side grave was undisturbed. Burial chamber in the side grave is constructed from spruce logs. The tomb remained intact and buried in the burial inventory. In the Northern half of the chamber were found the remains of the buried. In the burial chamber were found more than 4 thousand gold items, an iron sword and dagger, a bronze mirror, clay, metal and wooden vessels, shoes and headdress, gold rings, statuettes, bronze and gold weapons, various vessels, a silver bowl with 26 written signs dating from the VI-V century BC. Many gold ornaments of clothing, headdress, and shoes found on and under the remains. Next to the remains found an arrow with a gold tip, a whip, the handle of which spirally wrapped with a wide gold ribbon, and a bag containing a bronze mirror and red paint. According to the research of scientists, in particular the anthropologist O. I. Ismagulov, remains belong to the Saks of Semirecheye a European appearance with an admixture of Mongoloid features. The age of the remains is 16\u201318 years, which may belong to a man or a woman. The form of clothing and method of burial suggest that \u00abThe Golden man\u00bb was a descendant of a prominent Saks tribe leader or a member of the Royal family.

Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of [[Otto Lilienthal]] in 1896; then a large step in significance came with the construction of the first powered airplane by the [[Wright brothers]] in the early 1900s. Since that time, aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the [[jet aircraft|jet]] which permitted a major form of transport throughout the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''aviation'' was coined by the French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_pA9-D4QETAoC#page/n7/mode/2up|title=Aviation ou Navigation aerienne par G. de La Landelle}}</ref> He derived the term from the verb ''avier'' (an unsuccessful [[neologism]] for \"to fly\"), itself derived from the Latin word ''avis'' (\"bird\") and the suffix ''-ation''.{{sfn|Cassard|2008|p=77}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of aviation}}\n\n===Early beginnings===\n\nThere are early legends of human flight such as the stories of [[Icarus]] in Greek myth, [[Jamshid]] and [[Shah]] [[Kay K\u0101vus]] in Persian myth,<ref>''The Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma of Firdaus\u00ed''.

The practicality of balloons was limited because they could only travel downwind. It was immediately recognized that a steerable, or [[Airship|dirigible]], balloon was required. [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] flew the first human-powered dirigible in 1784 and crossed the English Channel in one in 1785.\n\n[[Rigid airship]]s became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German [[Zeppelin]] company.\n\nThe most successful Zeppelin was the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]. It flew over one million miles, including an around-the-world flight in August 1929. However, the dominance of the Zeppelins over the airplanes of that period, which had a range of only a few hundred miles, was diminishing as airplane design advanced. The \"Golden Age\" of the airships ended on May 6, 1937 when the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] caught fire, killing 36 people. The cause of the Hindenburg accident was initially blamed on the use of hydrogen instead of helium as the lift gas. An internal investigation by the manufacturer revealed that the coating used in the material covering the frame was highly flammable and allowed static electricity to build up in the airship.{{sfn|De Angelis|1997|pages=87\u2013101}} Changes to the coating formulation reduced the risk of further Hindenburg type accidents. Although there have been periodic initiatives to revive their use, airships have seen only niche application since that time.\n\n===Heavier than air===\nIn 1799, Sir [[George Cayley]] set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Aviation History\n |url         = http://www.aviation-history.com/early/cayley.htm\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-26\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090413155148/http://aviation-history.com/early/cayley.htm\n |archivedate = 2009-04-13\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |title       = Sir George Carley (British Inventor and Scientist)\n |url         = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100795/Sir-George-Cayley-6th-Baronet\n |encyclopedia   = Britannica\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-26\n |quote       = English pioneer of aerial navigation and aeronautical engineering and designer of the first successful glider to carry a human being aloft.\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090311002545/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100795/Sir-George-Cayley-6th-Baronet\n |archivedate = 2009-03-11\n}}</ref> Early dirigible developments included machine-powered propulsion ([[Henri Giffard]], 1852), rigid frames ([[David Schwarz (aviation inventor)|David Schwarz]], 1896) and improved speed and maneuverability ([[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], 1901)\n\n[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|First powered and controlled flight by the [[Wright brothers]], December 17, 1903]]\nThere are [[Early flying machines|many competing claims]] for the earliest powered, heavier-than-air flight.

One of the most successful designs of this period was the [[Douglas DC-3]], which became the first [[airliner]] to be profitable carrying passengers exclusively, starting the modern era of passenger airline service. By the beginning of World War II, many towns and cities had built airports, and there were numerous qualified pilots available. The war brought many innovations to aviation, including the first [[turbojet|jet]] aircraft and the first liquid-fueled [[rocket]]s.\n\n[[File:Helios cthomas.jpg|thumb|left|[[NASA]]'s [[Helios Prototype|Helios]] researches [[solar power]]ed flight.]]\nAfter World War II, especially in North America, there was a boom in [[general aviation]], both private and commercial, as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive war-surplus transport and training aircraft became available. Manufacturers such as [[Cessna]], [[Piper Aircraft|Piper]], and [[Beechcraft]] expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middle-class market.\n\nBy the 1950s, the development of civil jets grew, beginning with the [[de Havilland Comet]], though the first widely used passenger jet was the [[Boeing 707]], because it was much more economical than other aircraft at that time. At the same time, [[gas turbine|turboprop]] propulsion began to appear for smaller commuter planes, making it possible to serve small-volume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions.\n\nSince the 1960s [[composite material]] airframes and quieter, more efficient engines have become available, and [[Concorde]] provided [[supersonic transport|supersonic passenger service]] for more than two decades, but the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control. The arrival of [[transistor|solid-state]] electronics, the [[Global Positioning System]], [[communications satellite|satellite communications]], and increasingly small and powerful computers and [[light-emitting diode|LED]] displays, have dramatically changed the cockpits of [[airliner]]s and, increasingly, of smaller aircraft as well. Pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain, obstructions, and other nearby aircraft on a map or through [[synthetic vision]], even at night or in low visibility.\n\nOn June 21, 2004, [[SpaceShipOne]] became the first privately funded aircraft to make a [[spaceflight]], opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, flying prototypes of aircraft powered by alternative fuels, such as [[ethanol]], [[electricity]], and even [[solar energy]], are becoming more common.\n\n==Operations of aircraft==\n\n===Civil aviation===\n{{Main|Civil aviation}} \nCivil aviation includes all non-military flying, both [[general aviation]] and [[scheduled air transport]].\n\n====Air transport====\n{{Main|Airline}}\n[[File:Northwest Airlines A330-323 (N805NW) landing at London Gatwick Airport.jpg|thumb|right|[[Northwest Airlines]] [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-323]]]]\n\nThere are five major manufacturers of civil transport aircraft (in alphabetical order):\n* [[Airbus]], based in Europe\n* [[Boeing]], based in the United States\n* [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], based in Canada\n* [[Embraer]], based in Brazil\n* [[United Aircraft Corporation]], based in Russia\n\nBoeing, Airbus, [[Ilyushin]] and [[Tupolev]] concentrate on wide-body and narrow-body jet [[airliner]]s, while Bombardier, Embraer and [[Sukhoi]] concentrate on [[regional airliner]]s.

Since then, [[open skies]] agreements have resulted in increased competition and choice for consumers, coupled with falling prices for airlines. The combination of high fuel prices, low fares, high salaries, and crises such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS epidemic]] have driven many older airlines to government-bailouts, bankruptcy or mergers. At the same time, [[low-cost carrier]]s such as [[Ryanair]], [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]] and [[WestJet]] have flourished.\n\n====General aviation====\n{{Main|General aviation}}\n[[File:cessna.120.g-btbw.arp.jpg|thumb|right|1947 [[Cessna 120]]]]\n\n''General aviation'' includes all non-scheduled civil flying, both [[private aviation|private]] and [[commercial aviation|commercial]]. General aviation may include business flights, [[air charter]], private aviation, flight training, [[hot air balloon|ballooning]], [[paragliding]], [[parachuting]], [[Glider (sailplane)|gliding]], [[hang gliding]], [[aerial photography]], [[powered hang glider|foot-launched powered hang gliders]], air ambulance, crop dusting, charter flights, [[traffic reporting]], police air patrols and forest fire fighting.\n\nEach country regulates aviation differently, but general aviation usually falls under different regulations depending on whether it is private or commercial and on the type of equipment involved.\n\nMany small aircraft manufacturers serve the general aviation market, with a focus on private aviation and flight training.\n\nThe most important recent developments for small aircraft (which form the bulk of the GA fleet) have been the introduction of advanced [[avionics]] (including [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) that were formerly found only in large [[airliner]]s, and the introduction of [[composite material]]s to make small aircraft lighter and faster. [[Ultralight aviation|Ultralight]] and [[homebuilt aircraft]] have also become increasingly popular for recreational use, since in most countries that allow private aviation, they are much less expensive and less heavily regulated than certified aircraft.\n\n===Military aviation===\n{{Main|Military aviation|Aerial warfare}}\nSimple [[balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]] were used as surveillance aircraft as early as the 18th century. Over the years, [[military aircraft]] have been built to meet ever increasing capability requirements. Manufacturers of military aircraft compete for contracts to supply their government's arsenal. Aircraft are selected based on factors like cost, performance, and the speed of production.\n[[File:Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed SR-71]] remains unsurpassed in many areas of performance.]]\n\n====Types of military aviation====\n* [[Fighter aircraft]]'s primary function is to destroy other aircraft. (e.g. [[Sopwith Camel]], [[A6M Zero]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]], [[MiG-29]], [[Su-27]], and [[F-22]]).\n* [[Ground attack|Ground attack aircraft]] are used against [[Tactical bombing|tactical]] earth-bound targets. (e.g. [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Stuka]], [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]], [[Ilyushin Il-2|Il-2]], [[J-22 Orao]], [[AH-64]] and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-25]]).\n* [[Bomber]]s are generally used against more [[Strategic bombing|strategic]] targets, such as factories and oil fields. (e.g. [[Zeppelin]], [[Tu-95]], [[Dassault Mirage IV|Mirage IV]], and [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]).\n* [[Military transport aircraft|Transport aircraft]] are used to transport hardware and personnel. (e.g. [[C-17 Globemaster III]], [[C-130 Hercules]] and [[Mil Mi-26]]).\n* [[Surveillance aircraft|Surveillance]] and [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] aircraft obtain information about enemy forces. (e.g. [[Rumpler Taube]], [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]], [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]], [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58]] and [[MiG-25R]]).\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)]] are used primarily as reconnaissance fixed-wing aircraft, though many also carry payloads. Cargo aircraft are in development.  (e.g. [[RQ-7|RQ-7B Shadow]], [[MQ-8|MQ-8 Fire Scout]], and [[MQ-1C|MQ-1C Gray Eagle]]).\n* [[Missile]]s deliver warheads, normally explosives, but also things like leaflets.\n\n=== Air safety ===\n{{main|Aviation safety}}\nAviation safety means the state of an aviation system or organization in which risks associated with aviation activities, related to, or in direct support of the operation of aircraft, are reduced and controlled to an acceptable level. It encompasses the theory, practice, investigation, and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education, and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel.\n\n==Aviation accidents and incidents==\n{{main|Aviation accidents and incidents}}\n[[File:crash.arp.600pix.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds|USAF Thunderbird]] pilot [[Ejection seat|ejecting]] from his [[F-16]] aircraft at an [[air show]] in 2003]]\n\nAn ''aviation accident'' is defined by the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]] Annex 13 as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, in which a person is fatally or seriously injured, the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure or the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Investigation Process Research Resource Site|title=International Investigation Standards|url=http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html|accessdate=7 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427102210/http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html|archivedate=27 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first fatal aviation accident occurred in a [[Wright Model A]] aircraft at [[Fort Myer|Fort Myer, Virginia, USA]], on September 17, 1908, resulting in injury to the pilot, [[Orville Wright]], and death of the passenger, Signal Corps Lieutenant [[Thomas Selfridge]].<ref>{{cite web|author=About.com Inventors|title=Wright Brothers \u2013 First Fatal Airplane Crash in 1908|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/weirdmuseums/ig/Wright-Brothers/First-Fatal-Airplane-Crash.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn ''aviation incident'' is defined as an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operations.<ref name=\"AirSafe.com\">{{cite web|last=AirSafe.com|title=Definitions of Key Terms Used by AirSafe.com|url=http://www.airsafe.com/events/define.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420172922/http://www.airsafe.com/events/define.htm|archivedate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn accident in which the damage to the aircraft is such that it must be written off, or in which the plane is destroyed, is called a ''hull loss accident''.<ref name=\"AirSafe.com\"/>\n\n==Air traffic control==\n{{Main|Air traffic control}}\n[[File:Towers Schiphol small.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Air traffic control tower]]s at [[Amsterdam Airport]]]]\n\nAir traffic control (ATC) involves communication with aircraft to help maintain separation&nbsp;\u2013 that is, they ensure that aircraft are sufficiently far enough apart horizontally or vertically for no risk of collision. Controllers may co-ordinate position reports provided by pilots, or in high traffic areas (such as the United States) they may use [[radar]] to see aircraft positions.\n\nThere are generally four different types of ATC:\n* center controllers, who control aircraft en route between airports\n* control towers (including tower, ground control, clearance delivery, and other services), which control aircraft within a small distance (typically 10\u201315&nbsp;km horizontal, and 1,000 m vertical) of an airport.\n* oceanic controllers, who control aircraft over international waters between continents, generally without radar service.\n* terminal controllers, who control aircraft in a wider area (typically 50\u201380&nbsp;km) around busy airports.\n\nATC is especially important for aircraft flying under [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR), when they may be in weather conditions that do not allow the pilots to see other aircraft. However, in very high-traffic areas, especially near major airports, aircraft flying under [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) are also required to follow instructions from ATC.\n\nIn addition to separation from other aircraft, ATC may provide weather advisories, terrain separation, navigation assistance, and other services to pilots, depending on their workload.\n\nATC do not control all flights. The majority of VFR (Visual Flight Rules) flights in North America are not required to contact ATC (unless they are passing through a busy terminal area or using a major airport), and in many areas, such as northern Canada and low altitude in northern Scotland, Air traffic control services are not available even for IFR flights at lower altitudes.\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{Main|Environmental impact of aviation}}\n\nLike all activities involving [[combustion]], operating powered aircraft (from airliners to hot air balloons) releases [[soot]] and other pollutants into the atmosphere. [[Greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) are also produced. In addition, there are environmental impacts specific to aviation: for instance, [[File:Contrails.jpg|thumb|Water vapor [[Condensation trails|contrails]] left by high-altitude jet [[airliner]]s.

Since that time, aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the [[jet aircraft|jet]] which permitted a major form of transport throughout the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''aviation'' was coined by the French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_pA9-D4QETAoC#page/n7/mode/2up|title=Aviation ou Navigation aerienne par G. de La Landelle}}</ref> He derived the term from the verb ''avier'' (an unsuccessful [[neologism]] for \"to fly\"), itself derived from the Latin word ''avis'' (\"bird\") and the suffix ''-ation''.{{sfn|Cassard|2008|p=77}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of aviation}}\n\n===Early beginnings===\n\nThere are early legends of human flight such as the stories of [[Icarus]] in Greek myth, [[Jamshid]] and [[Shah]] [[Kay K\u0101vus]] in Persian myth,<ref>''The Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma of Firdaus\u00ed''.

The practicality of balloons was limited because they could only travel downwind. It was immediately recognized that a steerable, or [[Airship|dirigible]], balloon was required. [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] flew the first human-powered dirigible in 1784 and crossed the English Channel in one in 1785.\n\n[[Rigid airship]]s became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German [[Zeppelin]] company.\n\nThe most successful Zeppelin was the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]. It flew over one million miles, including an around-the-world flight in August 1929. However, the dominance of the Zeppelins over the airplanes of that period, which had a range of only a few hundred miles, was diminishing as airplane design advanced. The \"Golden Age\" of the airships ended on May 6, 1937 when the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] caught fire, killing 36 people. The cause of the Hindenburg accident was initially blamed on the use of hydrogen instead of helium as the lift gas. An internal investigation by the manufacturer revealed that the coating used in the material covering the frame was highly flammable and allowed static electricity to build up in the airship.{{sfn|De Angelis|1997|pages=87\u2013101}} Changes to the coating formulation reduced the risk of further Hindenburg type accidents. Although there have been periodic initiatives to revive their use, airships have seen only niche application since that time.\n\n===Heavier than air===\nIn 1799, Sir [[George Cayley]] set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Aviation History\n |url         = http://www.aviation-history.com/early/cayley.htm\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-26\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090413155148/http://aviation-history.com/early/cayley.htm\n |archivedate = 2009-04-13\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |title       = Sir George Carley (British Inventor and Scientist)\n |url         = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100795/Sir-George-Cayley-6th-Baronet\n |encyclopedia   = Britannica\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-26\n |quote       = English pioneer of aerial navigation and aeronautical engineering and designer of the first successful glider to carry a human being aloft.\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090311002545/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100795/Sir-George-Cayley-6th-Baronet\n |archivedate = 2009-03-11\n}}</ref> Early dirigible developments included machine-powered propulsion ([[Henri Giffard]], 1852), rigid frames ([[David Schwarz (aviation inventor)|David Schwarz]], 1896) and improved speed and maneuverability ([[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], 1901)\n\n[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|First powered and controlled flight by the [[Wright brothers]], December 17, 1903]]\nThere are [[Early flying machines|many competing claims]] for the earliest powered, heavier-than-air flight.

One of the most successful designs of this period was the [[Douglas DC-3]], which became the first [[airliner]] to be profitable carrying passengers exclusively, starting the modern era of passenger airline service. By the beginning of World War II, many towns and cities had built airports, and there were numerous qualified pilots available. The war brought many innovations to aviation, including the first [[turbojet|jet]] aircraft and the first liquid-fueled [[rocket]]s.\n\n[[File:Helios cthomas.jpg|thumb|left|[[NASA]]'s [[Helios Prototype|Helios]] researches [[solar power]]ed flight.]]\nAfter World War II, especially in North America, there was a boom in [[general aviation]], both private and commercial, as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive war-surplus transport and training aircraft became available. Manufacturers such as [[Cessna]], [[Piper Aircraft|Piper]], and [[Beechcraft]] expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middle-class market.\n\nBy the 1950s, the development of civil jets grew, beginning with the [[de Havilland Comet]], though the first widely used passenger jet was the [[Boeing 707]], because it was much more economical than other aircraft at that time. At the same time, [[gas turbine|turboprop]] propulsion began to appear for smaller commuter planes, making it possible to serve small-volume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions.\n\nSince the 1960s [[composite material]] airframes and quieter, more efficient engines have become available, and [[Concorde]] provided [[supersonic transport|supersonic passenger service]] for more than two decades, but the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control. The arrival of [[transistor|solid-state]] electronics, the [[Global Positioning System]], [[communications satellite|satellite communications]], and increasingly small and powerful computers and [[light-emitting diode|LED]] displays, have dramatically changed the cockpits of [[airliner]]s and, increasingly, of smaller aircraft as well. Pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain, obstructions, and other nearby aircraft on a map or through [[synthetic vision]], even at night or in low visibility.\n\nOn June 21, 2004, [[SpaceShipOne]] became the first privately funded aircraft to make a [[spaceflight]], opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, flying prototypes of aircraft powered by alternative fuels, such as [[ethanol]], [[electricity]], and even [[solar energy]], are becoming more common.\n\n==Operations of aircraft==\n\n===Civil aviation===\n{{Main|Civil aviation}} \nCivil aviation includes all non-military flying, both [[general aviation]] and [[scheduled air transport]].\n\n====Air transport====\n{{Main|Airline}}\n[[File:Northwest Airlines A330-323 (N805NW) landing at London Gatwick Airport.jpg|thumb|right|[[Northwest Airlines]] [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-323]]]]\n\nThere are five major manufacturers of civil transport aircraft (in alphabetical order):\n* [[Airbus]], based in Europe\n* [[Boeing]], based in the United States\n* [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], based in Canada\n* [[Embraer]], based in Brazil\n* [[United Aircraft Corporation]], based in Russia\n\nBoeing, Airbus, [[Ilyushin]] and [[Tupolev]] concentrate on wide-body and narrow-body jet [[airliner]]s, while Bombardier, Embraer and [[Sukhoi]] concentrate on [[regional airliner]]s.

Since then, [[open skies]] agreements have resulted in increased competition and choice for consumers, coupled with falling prices for airlines. The combination of high fuel prices, low fares, high salaries, and crises such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS epidemic]] have driven many older airlines to government-bailouts, bankruptcy or mergers. At the same time, [[low-cost carrier]]s such as [[Ryanair]], [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]] and [[WestJet]] have flourished.\n\n====General aviation====\n{{Main|General aviation}}\n[[File:cessna.120.g-btbw.arp.jpg|thumb|right|1947 [[Cessna 120]]]]\n\n''General aviation'' includes all non-scheduled civil flying, both [[private aviation|private]] and [[commercial aviation|commercial]]. General aviation may include business flights, [[air charter]], private aviation, flight training, [[hot air balloon|ballooning]], [[paragliding]], [[parachuting]], [[Glider (sailplane)|gliding]], [[hang gliding]], [[aerial photography]], [[powered hang glider|foot-launched powered hang gliders]], air ambulance, crop dusting, charter flights, [[traffic reporting]], police air patrols and forest fire fighting.\n\nEach country regulates aviation differently, but general aviation usually falls under different regulations depending on whether it is private or commercial and on the type of equipment involved.\n\nMany small aircraft manufacturers serve the general aviation market, with a focus on private aviation and flight training.\n\nThe most important recent developments for small aircraft (which form the bulk of the GA fleet) have been the introduction of advanced [[avionics]] (including [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) that were formerly found only in large [[airliner]]s, and the introduction of [[composite material]]s to make small aircraft lighter and faster. [[Ultralight aviation|Ultralight]] and [[homebuilt aircraft]] have also become increasingly popular for recreational use, since in most countries that allow private aviation, they are much less expensive and less heavily regulated than certified aircraft.\n\n===Military aviation===\n{{Main|Military aviation|Aerial warfare}}\nSimple [[balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]] were used as surveillance aircraft as early as the 18th century. Over the years, [[military aircraft]] have been built to meet ever increasing capability requirements. Manufacturers of military aircraft compete for contracts to supply their government's arsenal. Aircraft are selected based on factors like cost, performance, and the speed of production.\n[[File:Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed SR-71]] remains unsurpassed in many areas of performance.]]\n\n====Types of military aviation====\n* [[Fighter aircraft]]'s primary function is to destroy other aircraft. (e.g. [[Sopwith Camel]], [[A6M Zero]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]], [[MiG-29]], [[Su-27]], and [[F-22]]).\n* [[Ground attack|Ground attack aircraft]] are used against [[Tactical bombing|tactical]] earth-bound targets. (e.g. [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Stuka]], [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]], [[Ilyushin Il-2|Il-2]], [[J-22 Orao]], [[AH-64]] and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-25]]).\n* [[Bomber]]s are generally used against more [[Strategic bombing|strategic]] targets, such as factories and oil fields. (e.g. [[Zeppelin]], [[Tu-95]], [[Dassault Mirage IV|Mirage IV]], and [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]).\n* [[Military transport aircraft|Transport aircraft]] are used to transport hardware and personnel. (e.g. [[C-17 Globemaster III]], [[C-130 Hercules]] and [[Mil Mi-26]]).\n* [[Surveillance aircraft|Surveillance]] and [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] aircraft obtain information about enemy forces. (e.g. [[Rumpler Taube]], [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]], [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]], [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58]] and [[MiG-25R]]).\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)]] are used primarily as reconnaissance fixed-wing aircraft, though many also carry payloads. Cargo aircraft are in development.  (e.g. [[RQ-7|RQ-7B Shadow]], [[MQ-8|MQ-8 Fire Scout]], and [[MQ-1C|MQ-1C Gray Eagle]]).\n* [[Missile]]s deliver warheads, normally explosives, but also things like leaflets.\n\n=== Air safety ===\n{{main|Aviation safety}}\nAviation safety means the state of an aviation system or organization in which risks associated with aviation activities, related to, or in direct support of the operation of aircraft, are reduced and controlled to an acceptable level. It encompasses the theory, practice, investigation, and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education, and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel.\n\n==Aviation accidents and incidents==\n{{main|Aviation accidents and incidents}}\n[[File:crash.arp.600pix.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds|USAF Thunderbird]] pilot [[Ejection seat|ejecting]] from his [[F-16]] aircraft at an [[air show]] in 2003]]\n\nAn ''aviation accident'' is defined by the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]] Annex 13 as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, in which a person is fatally or seriously injured, the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure or the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Investigation Process Research Resource Site|title=International Investigation Standards|url=http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html|accessdate=7 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427102210/http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html|archivedate=27 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first fatal aviation accident occurred in a [[Wright Model A]] aircraft at [[Fort Myer|Fort Myer, Virginia, USA]], on September 17, 1908, resulting in injury to the pilot, [[Orville Wright]], and death of the passenger, Signal Corps Lieutenant [[Thomas Selfridge]].<ref>{{cite web|author=About.com Inventors|title=Wright Brothers \u2013 First Fatal Airplane Crash in 1908|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/weirdmuseums/ig/Wright-Brothers/First-Fatal-Airplane-Crash.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn ''aviation incident'' is defined as an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operations.<ref name=\"AirSafe.com\">{{cite web|last=AirSafe.com|title=Definitions of Key Terms Used by AirSafe.com|url=http://www.airsafe.com/events/define.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420172922/http://www.airsafe.com/events/define.htm|archivedate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn accident in which the damage to the aircraft is such that it must be written off, or in which the plane is destroyed, is called a ''hull loss accident''.<ref name=\"AirSafe.com\"/>\n\n==Air traffic control==\n{{Main|Air traffic control}}\n[[File:Towers Schiphol small.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Air traffic control tower]]s at [[Amsterdam Airport]]]]\n\nAir traffic control (ATC) involves communication with aircraft to help maintain separation&nbsp;\u2013 that is, they ensure that aircraft are sufficiently far enough apart horizontally or vertically for no risk of collision. Controllers may co-ordinate position reports provided by pilots, or in high traffic areas (such as the United States) they may use [[radar]] to see aircraft positions.\n\nThere are generally four different types of ATC:\n* center controllers, who control aircraft en route between airports\n* control towers (including tower, ground control, clearance delivery, and other services), which control aircraft within a small distance (typically 10\u201315&nbsp;km horizontal, and 1,000 m vertical) of an airport.\n* oceanic controllers, who control aircraft over international waters between continents, generally without radar service.\n* terminal controllers, who control aircraft in a wider area (typically 50\u201380&nbsp;km) around busy airports.\n\nATC is especially important for aircraft flying under [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR), when they may be in weather conditions that do not allow the pilots to see other aircraft. However, in very high-traffic areas, especially near major airports, aircraft flying under [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) are also required to follow instructions from ATC.\n\nIn addition to separation from other aircraft, ATC may provide weather advisories, terrain separation, navigation assistance, and other services to pilots, depending on their workload.\n\nATC do not control all flights. The majority of VFR (Visual Flight Rules) flights in North America are not required to contact ATC (unless they are passing through a busy terminal area or using a major airport), and in many areas, such as northern Canada and low altitude in northern Scotland, Air traffic control services are not available even for IFR flights at lower altitudes.\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{Main|Environmental impact of aviation}}\n\nLike all activities involving [[combustion]], operating powered aircraft (from airliners to hot air balloons) releases [[soot]] and other pollutants into the atmosphere. [[Greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) are also produced. In addition, there are environmental impacts specific to aviation: for instance, [[File:Contrails.jpg|thumb|Water vapor [[Condensation trails|contrails]] left by high-altitude jet [[airliner]]s.

The pose can be uncomfortable for people unused to sitting on the floor, and attempts to force the legs into position can injure the knees. \n\n[[Shiva]], the meditating ascetic God of [[Hinduism]], [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of [[Buddhism]], and the [[Tirthankara]]s in [[Jainism]] have been depicted in the lotus position, especially in statues. The pose is used as an image of both Buddhist meditation and of yoga, and as such has found a place in Western culture as a symbol of healthy living and well-being.\n\n== Etymology and origins ==\n[[File:Sacred lotus Nelumbo nucifera.jpg|thumb|The sacred lotus, ''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'', grows out of mud to shine as a beautiful flower, thus symbolising [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]].{{sfn|Temple|2007|p=Chapter 1, The Symbolism of the Lotus Flower}}]]\n\nThe name Padmasana is from the [[Sanskrit]] \u092a\u0926\u094d\u092e ''Padma'', \"lotus\" and \u0906\u0938\u0928, \u0100sana, \"posture\" or \"seat\".{{sfn|Iyengar|1991|pages=129-133}}<ref>{{cite book |author=Zimmer, Heinrich Robert |authorlink=Heinrich Zimmer |title=Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IYVBgAAQBAJ |year=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-6684-7 |page=100 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906092006/https://books.google.com/books?id=5IYVBgAAQBAJ |archive-date=6 September 2017 |url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Nelumbo nucifera|sacred lotus]] symbolises growth towards perfection and [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] as it is rooted in the mud at the bottom of the pond, but rises to shine as a beautiful flower in the sunlight above the water.{{sfn|Temple|2007|p=Chapter 1, The Symbolism of the Lotus Flower}} In [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the pose is also called the \"[[vajra]] position\" (Skt.

The words are arranged in rows of fourteen lines, and follow the [[Roman Rite|Roman version]] of the texts. The lettering is inscribed in silver and [[Gilding|gold]], and placed within borders ornamented with flowers, foliage and [[grotesque]]s, on pages dyed a deep blueish black. It contains fourteen full-page [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and opens with the months of the [[Liturgical year#Catholic Church|liturgical calendar]] (folios 3 [[Recto and verso|verso]]\u201314 recto), followed by the [[Little Office of Our Lady|Hours of the Virgin]] (folios 14v\u201398v), and ends with the [[Office of the Dead]] (folio 121v). It has been in the collection of the [[Morgan Library & Museum]], New York, since 1912.\n\nMS M.493 is one of seven surviving [[black books of hours]], all originating from Bruges and dated to the mid-to-late 15th century. They are so named from their unusual dark blueish appearance, a colourisation achieved through the expensive process of dyeing the [[vellum]] with [[iron gall ink]]. This dye is very corrosive and the surviving examples have mostly decomposed; MS M.493 is in relatively good condition due to its very thick parchment.\n\nThe book is a masterpiece of Late Gothic manuscript illumination.<ref name=\"OMI\">[http://www.omifacsimiles.com/cats/hours_i.pdf \"Das Schwarze Stundenbuch\"].

This can be corrosive both to parchment and to dye, and only golden pigments could withstand the corrosion.

The words are arranged in rows of fourteen lines, and follow the [[Roman Rite|Roman version]] of the texts. The lettering is inscribed in silver and [[Gilding|gold]], and placed within borders ornamented with flowers, foliage and [[grotesque]]s, on pages dyed a deep blueish black. It contains fourteen full-page [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and opens with the months of the [[Liturgical year#Catholic Church|liturgical calendar]] (folios 3 [[Recto and verso|verso]]\u201314 recto), followed by the [[Little Office of Our Lady|Hours of the Virgin]] (folios 14v\u201398v), and ends with the [[Office of the Dead]] (folio 121v). It has been in the collection of the [[Morgan Library & Museum]], New York, since 1912.\n\nMS M.493 is one of seven surviving [[black books of hours]], all originating from Bruges and dated to the mid-to-late 15th century. They are so named from their unusual dark blueish appearance, a colourisation achieved through the expensive process of dyeing the [[vellum]] with [[iron gall ink]]. This dye is very corrosive and the surviving examples have mostly decomposed; MS M.493 is in relatively good condition due to its very thick parchment.\n\nThe book is a masterpiece of Late Gothic manuscript illumination.<ref name=\"OMI\">[http://www.omifacsimiles.com/cats/hours_i.pdf \"Das Schwarze Stundenbuch\"]. New York: Old Manuscripts & Incunabula. p. 29.

From then on Philip wore only black clothes, as an expression of his grief.<ref name=\"zf\" /> The style was adapted by other members of the court, who seem to have favoured black against gold and silver in artworks as well in formal dress, as can be seen in [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s contemporary ''[[Jean Wauquelin presenting his 'Chroniques de Hainaut' to Philip the Good]]''.<ref name=\"i373\">Walther (2014), p. 373</ref> [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]] observed of the Burgundian rulers that their collections were \"luxurious, the home treasury, and the library full of treasures, and the court ceremonial were oriented on a godlike super-elevation of the ruler.\"<ref name=\"zf\" />\n\nThe book's parchment was darkened by soaking it in [[iron gall ink]]. This can be corrosive both to parchment and to dye, and only golden pigments could withstand the corrosion. The surviving black books are generally in poor condition; MS M.493 is the best-preserved example, its thick leaves having protected the parchment.

Coming Soon Magazine. Issue 19. 11 November 1996.</ref>\n}}\n'''''Uncle Henry's Playhouse''''' (released in the UK as '''''Uncle Henry's MindBlower''''') is the third game in ''The 7th Guest'' series. Functionally the game is a [[Compilation (games)|compilation]] game mostly composed of the puzzles from [[Trilobyte (company)|Trilobyte]]'s games ''[[The 7th Guest]]'', ''[[The 11th Hour (computer game)|The 11th Hour]]'', and ''[[Clandestiny]]'', but featuring little plot. The game has been noted for its low sales figures (27 in the US) and its rarity/obscurity relative to its blockbuster predecessors, ''The 7th Guest'' and ''The 11th Hour''. The game is primarily intended as a means of presenting puzzles from the previous titles in the ''7th Guest'' series and consequently it has a rather simplistic plot that has been criticized by reviewers for its thinness in comparison to the previous games.<ref name=delgado>Delgado, Tony. ''[http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2007/09/column_beyond_tetris_the_7th_g.php COLUMN: 'Beyond Tetris' - The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour: Fossilization]''. [[Game Set Watch]]. 26 September 2007.</ref> The game also includes previews for two then-upcoming Trilobyte games, ''[[Tender Loving Care (video game)|Tender Loving Care]]'' (eventually released by [[Aftermath Media]]) and ''Dog Eat Dog'' (never released).<ref name=csoon20review/>\n\n==Plot==\nHenry Stauf, the main antagonist from ''The 7th Guest'' and ''The 11th Hour'' is a toymaker with a dark and disturbed imagination inclined toward the macabre and the deadly. In ''Uncle Henry's Playhouse'' Stauf has created a twisted dollhouse, the 12 rooms of which he has furnished with miniaturized puzzles from his previous mansions. In the attic of the dollhouse Stauf has placed a thirteenth puzzle that can only be accessed once the player has satisfactorily completed the other 12 puzzles.<ref name=manual>''Uncle Henry's Playhouse'' instruction manual. Trilobyte. 1996.</ref> As the player progresses through the game, Stauf observes the proceedings and offers commentary in the form of gleeful taunts for the player's failures and sounds of unhappiness for the player's successes.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Uncle Henry's Playhouse'' plays like the other two games in the series employing a simple [[point-and-click]] interface for 13 puzzles. The dollhouse that serves as the setting of the game includes 12 main rooms featuring puzzles from ''The 7th Guest'', ''The 11th Hour'', and ''Clandestiny'' (an unrelated title not in the ''7th Guest'' series), an attic featuring an all-new 13th puzzle, and the foyer from which the player may access the guest book.<ref name=manual/> Completing each puzzle in ''Uncle Henry's Playhouse'' automatically saves the game for the player allowing the player to quit at any time and then to start up again where he or she left off by signing in through the guestbook. Unlike the previous ''11th Hour'', there is no option to skip puzzles that the player finds too challenging although tips are available from the foyer.<ref name=csoon20review>Claude, Frederick. ''[http://www.csoon.com/issue20/uncle.htm Uncle Henry's Playhouse]''. Coming Soon Magazine.

Functionally the game is a [[Compilation (games)|compilation]] game mostly composed of the puzzles from [[Trilobyte (company)|Trilobyte]]'s games ''[[The 7th Guest]]'', ''[[The 11th Hour (computer game)|The 11th Hour]]'', and ''[[Clandestiny]]'', but featuring little plot. The game has been noted for its low sales figures (27 in the US) and its rarity/obscurity relative to its blockbuster predecessors, ''The 7th Guest'' and ''The 11th Hour''. The game is primarily intended as a means of presenting puzzles from the previous titles in the ''7th Guest'' series and consequently it has a rather simplistic plot that has been criticized by reviewers for its thinness in comparison to the previous games.<ref name=delgado>Delgado, Tony. ''[http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2007/09/column_beyond_tetris_the_7th_g.php COLUMN: 'Beyond Tetris' - The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour: Fossilization]''. [[Game Set Watch]]. 26 September 2007.</ref> The game also includes previews for two then-upcoming Trilobyte games, ''[[Tender Loving Care (video game)|Tender Loving Care]]'' (eventually released by [[Aftermath Media]]) and ''Dog Eat Dog'' (never released).<ref name=csoon20review/>\n\n==Plot==\nHenry Stauf, the main antagonist from ''The 7th Guest'' and ''The 11th Hour'' is a toymaker with a dark and disturbed imagination inclined toward the macabre and the deadly. In ''Uncle Henry's Playhouse'' Stauf has created a twisted dollhouse, the 12 rooms of which he has furnished with miniaturized puzzles from his previous mansions. In the attic of the dollhouse Stauf has placed a thirteenth puzzle that can only be accessed once the player has satisfactorily completed the other 12 puzzles.<ref name=manual>''Uncle Henry's Playhouse'' instruction manual. Trilobyte. 1996.</ref> As the player progresses through the game, Stauf observes the proceedings and offers commentary in the form of gleeful taunts for the player's failures and sounds of unhappiness for the player's successes.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Uncle Henry's Playhouse'' plays like the other two games in the series employing a simple [[point-and-click]] interface for 13 puzzles. The dollhouse that serves as the setting of the game includes 12 main rooms featuring puzzles from ''The 7th Guest'', ''The 11th Hour'', and ''Clandestiny'' (an unrelated title not in the ''7th Guest'' series), an attic featuring an all-new 13th puzzle, and the foyer from which the player may access the guest book.<ref name=manual/> Completing each puzzle in ''Uncle Henry's Playhouse'' automatically saves the game for the player allowing the player to quit at any time and then to start up again where he or she left off by signing in through the guestbook. Unlike the previous ''11th Hour'', there is no option to skip puzzles that the player finds too challenging although tips are available from the foyer.<ref name=csoon20review>Claude, Frederick.
