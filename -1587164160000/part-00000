Restrooms are available at several trailheads, and food and drink establishments are along Rockside Road, as well as the [[Boston, Summit County, Ohio|Boston]] Store in Peninsula, and at the seasonal farmer's market on Botzum Road. Three visitor centers are located along the path: the Canal Exploration Center, Boston Store, and the Hunt House. The trail connects to a [[Cleveland Metroparks]] trail at Rockside Road, which continues another {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} north.

Sections of the towpath trail outside of Cuyahoga Valley National Park are owned and maintained by various state and local agencies.

The left arm of this \"V\", flowing north through the park, corresponds to an older preglacial valley, while the right arm corresponds to relatively new drainage. The new segment cut into the old at [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio|Cuyahoga Falls]], the base of the \"V\". Other streams have made routes into the Cuyahoga preglacial valley by cutting gorges with waterfalls such as those found along the [[Tinkers Creek (Cuyahoga River tributary)|Tinkers]], [[Brandywine Creek (Cuyahoga River tributary)|Brandywine]] and Chippewa Creeks. These waterfalls form as flowing water erodes the [[Bedford Shale]], which underlies the more resistant [[Berea Sandstone]]. [[Moraine|Glacial drift]] fills the valley to a depth of {{convert|400|ft|m}}. This fill is very complex due to [[ponding]] in front of the ice before and after each glaciation. Beach deposits, [[Bar (river morphology)|gravel bar]]s and other shoreline deposits from [[Lake Maumee]] are found in the valley, as are gravels from the time of [[Lake Arkona]], and ridges marking the shores of [[Lake Whittlesey]], [[Lake Warren]], and [[Lake Wayne]].<ref name=\"Leverett\">{{cite book|last1=Leverett|first1=Frank|title=Glacial Formations and Drainage Features of the Erie and Ohio Basins, USGS Monograph Vol. XLI|date=1902|publisher=US Government Printing Office|location=Washington|page=216}}</ref><ref name=\"Cushing\">{{cite book|last1=Cushing|first1=H.P.|last2=Leverett|first2=Frank|last3=Van Horn|first3=Frank|title=Geology and Mineral Resources of the Cleveland District, Ohio, USGS Bulletin 818|date=1931|publisher=US Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=9, 16\u201319, 68\u201379}}</ref>\n\nA noticeable remnant of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] is the Defiance moraine, which trends from [[Defiance, Ohio|Defiance]] in western Ohio, across the state into Pennsylvania.

The Boston Ledges are the most noteworthy example. As the Mississippian shale underneath is washed away, huge blocks of the Sharon result from the settling.

A gas boom occurred in 1914\u20131915, and by 1931, several hundred gas wells were producing from the [[Devonian]] Huron shale.

The park includes compatible-use sites not owned by the federal government, such as regional parks of the [[Cleveland Metroparks]] and [[Summit Metro Parks]] systems.\n\nThe natural areas include forests, rolling hills, narrow ravines, wetlands, rivers, and waterfalls. About 100 waterfalls are located in the Cuyahoga Valley, with the most popular being the {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=on}} tall [[Brandywine Creek (Cuyahoga River tributary)#Brandywine Falls|Brandywine Falls]]\u2014the tallest waterfall in the park and the tallest in Northeast Ohio.

Restrooms are available at several trailheads, and food and drink establishments are along Rockside Road, as well as the [[Boston, Summit County, Ohio|Boston]] Store in Peninsula, and at the seasonal farmer's market on Botzum Road. Three visitor centers are located along the path: the Canal Exploration Center, Boston Store, and the Hunt House. The trail connects to a [[Cleveland Metroparks]] trail at Rockside Road, which continues another {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} north. The Summit County trail continues through [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] and further south through Stark and Tuscarawas counties to [[Zoar, Ohio]], almost {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}} continuously, with a single {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} interruption. Sections of the towpath trail outside of Cuyahoga Valley National Park are owned and maintained by various state and local agencies. The trail also meets the [[Buckeye Trail]] in the national park near Boston Store. Another section of the Summit County Bike & Hike Trail system is nearby, connecting to [[Brandywine Creek (Cuyahoga River)#Brandywine Falls|Brandywine Falls]], Cleveland Metroparks' Bedford Reservation and the cities of [[Solon, Ohio|Solon]] in Cuyahoga County, [[Hudson, Ohio|Hudson]] and [[Stow, Ohio|Stow]] in Summit County, and [[Kent, Ohio|Kent]] and [[Ravenna, Ohio|Ravenna]] in [[Portage County, Ohio|Portage County]].\n\nSeasonally, the [[Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad]] (CVSR) allows visitors to travel along the towpath from Rockside Road to Akron, embarking or disembarking at any of the stops along the way. The train is especially popular with bicyclists, and for [[Leaf peeping|viewing and photographing fall colors]]. CVSR is independently owned and operated.\n\n==== History ====\n[[File:OhioErieCanalLock.JPG|thumb|left|Restored [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] Lock at the Canal Exploration Center]]\nThe Towpath Trail follows the historic route of the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]]. Before the canal was built, Ohio was a sparsely settled wilderness where travel was difficult and getting crops to market was nearly impossible. The canal, built between 1825 and 1832, provided a new transportation route from [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] on [[Lake Erie]], to [[Portsmouth, Ohio|Portsmouth]] on the [[Ohio River]].

The left arm of this \"V\", flowing north through the park, corresponds to an older preglacial valley, while the right arm corresponds to relatively new drainage. The new segment cut into the old at [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio|Cuyahoga Falls]], the base of the \"V\". Other streams have made routes into the Cuyahoga preglacial valley by cutting gorges with waterfalls such as those found along the [[Tinkers Creek (Cuyahoga River tributary)|Tinkers]], [[Brandywine Creek (Cuyahoga River tributary)|Brandywine]] and Chippewa Creeks. These waterfalls form as flowing water erodes the [[Bedford Shale]], which underlies the more resistant [[Berea Sandstone]]. [[Moraine|Glacial drift]] fills the valley to a depth of {{convert|400|ft|m}}. This fill is very complex due to [[ponding]] in front of the ice before and after each glaciation. Beach deposits, [[Bar (river morphology)|gravel bar]]s and other shoreline deposits from [[Lake Maumee]] are found in the valley, as are gravels from the time of [[Lake Arkona]], and ridges marking the shores of [[Lake Whittlesey]], [[Lake Warren]], and [[Lake Wayne]].<ref name=\"Leverett\">{{cite book|last1=Leverett|first1=Frank|title=Glacial Formations and Drainage Features of the Erie and Ohio Basins, USGS Monograph Vol. XLI|date=1902|publisher=US Government Printing Office|location=Washington|page=216}}</ref><ref name=\"Cushing\">{{cite book|last1=Cushing|first1=H.P.|last2=Leverett|first2=Frank|last3=Van Horn|first3=Frank|title=Geology and Mineral Resources of the Cleveland District, Ohio, USGS Bulletin 818|date=1931|publisher=US Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=9, 16\u201319, 68\u201379}}</ref>\n\nA noticeable remnant of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] is the Defiance moraine, which trends from [[Defiance, Ohio|Defiance]] in western Ohio, across the state into Pennsylvania. As Cushing et al. point out, \"The Defiance moraine represents the last notable stand of the glacial front in this region.\" The moraine varies in width from {{convert|2-4|mi|km|abbr=on}}, and according to Leverett, \"it is like a broad wave whose crest stands 20 to 50 feet above the border of the plain outside it.\" This moraine forms a lobe that protrudes south into the valley for {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} all the way to [[Peninsula, Ohio|Peninsula]], the lobe being {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide at the north end, tapering to {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide at the south end.

River channels were incised into the Bedford Shale and subsequently these channels were filled by the Berea Sandstone. Besides setting the stage for majestic gorges and waterfalls within the valley, they have provided an economic use as well. The Berea Sandstone was quarried in [[Berea, Ohio|Berea]] for [[grindstone]]s and building stones, while the lowermost part of the Bedford Shale was quarried in [[South Euclid, Ohio|South Euclid]] and [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]] for its [[bluestone]].<ref name=Cushing/>{{rp|109\u2013111}}<ref name=\"Pepper\">{{cite book|last1=Pepper|first1=James|last2=De Witt|first2=Wallace|last3=Demarest|first3=David|title=Geology of the Bedford Shale and Berea Sandstone in the Appalachian Basin, USGS Professional Paper 259|date=1954|publisher=US Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=12, 70\u201371}}</ref>\n\nThe Sharon [[conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] is a [[Pennsylvanian (geology)#Subdivisions|Lower Pennsylvanian]] [[Geological formation|formation]] composed of sandstone and conglomerate which forms, according to Cushing et al., \"disconnected patches or [[Inliers and outliers (geology)|outliers]] that cap the highest hills... these outliers stand boldly above the surrounding country\" due to its resistance to erosion. The Boston Ledges are the most noteworthy example. As the Mississippian shale underneath is washed away, huge blocks of the Sharon result from the settling.

A gas boom occurred in 1914\u20131915, and by 1931, several hundred gas wells were producing from the [[Devonian]] Huron shale. Production came from shales {{convert|1250|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick at depths from {{convert|400-1840|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Pressures were {{convert|3-135|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} flowing less than {{convert|20000|cuft|m3}} of gas daily, but was sufficient to furnish light for a house or two, and sometimes heat.

Conlon, Neville, Love and Robinson confirmed the next day on [[Twitter]] that the post was indeed from Brown, and that they had received a letter with similar content from him. They apologised and gave a statement that Brown's personal opinion in no way represents Five as a band. The forum thread containing Brown's message has since been deleted, as per Robinson's and their manager's request.

The Wilson family's frequent moves were determined by where Clifford could find work.  In November 1907, Mamie died in childbirth.<ref name=Saito />  Clifford's work required him to travel, which made it impossible for him to care for the girls on his own.  Underwood and her younger sister were handed over to relatives in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], to be raised. Underwood recalled that she and her sister did not stay in Terre Haute and that they moved frequently, often winding up in the hands of public charity.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nClifford became distressed with the way his daughters were being treated and found two foster homes in [[Portland, Indiana]], each willing to take one of the girls. Underwood's sister was sent to live with a farm family. Underwood's new home was with Charles and Belle Ewry and their three sons. She and the eldest of the three sons, Ralph, liked each other immediately. Ralph Ewry became her friend and protector.  Underwood later described the Ewry household as a serious environment, made bearable only by Ralph's kindness.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nUnderwood did well in school and skipped three grades; however, by the time she entered high school in 1916 her enthusiasm for her studies had waned and she dropped out in the tenth grade. Underwood took as job as a clerk in the basement of Cartwright's department store in Portland, Indiana. She became increasingly unhappy living with the Ewrys, particularly following Ralph's deployment overseas as a soldier during World War I.  Ralph sensed Underwood's discontent in her letters to him and, believing that she might be better off with a blood relative, managed to locate one of her distant relatives in San Francisco.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nUnderwood arrived in San Francisco in November 1918, and moved in with her relative who lived in an apartment on Geary Street.  Underwood knew she would be expected to contribute to household expenses and set out to find a job.  After a few frustrating days of unsuccessful job hunting, she arrived at the apartment only to discover that her relative had moved out leaving Underwood broke, alone, and homeless.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nAnother of Underwood's female relatives invited her to move to [[Hollywood]], California, and live with her.  Soon after her arrival it became clear that Underwood's relative was interested only in transforming the girl into a child star. When that plan failed, the relative put Underwood out on the street.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nUnderwood became a resident at the [[Salvation Army]]'s home for working women in downtown Los Angeles and got a job at the [[The Broadway|Broadway Department Store]].  It was there that she met Evelyn Conners, a woman a few months her junior, who would become her lifelong friend.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nFollowing a brief move to [[Salt Lake City]], Utah, Underwood returned to Los Angeles, where she found work as a waitress at the Pig \u2018n Whistle restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. One day in April 1920, she was lamenting to Harry Underwood, a co-worker, that her Hollywood relative had resurfaced and demanded that Underwood live with her again and relinquish her paychecks to her, or she would turn the underage girl over to the authorities. Harry told her that the relative could not do that if he and Underwood were married. The couple married three weeks later on April 28, 1920.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nBy 1926, Underwood and her husband had become parents to a daughter and son.  Underwood's husband and sister worked outside the home, but the family still struggled to make ends meet.  One of the small economies that Underwood practiced was to wear her sister's hand-me-down silk stockings. One day Underwood asked her husband for the money to buy a new pair of stockings, but he demurred. An argument ensued and Underwood told her husband that if he would not give her money for stockings, she would get a job and earn them herself.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nIn her autobiography, ''Newspaperwoman'' (Harper Brothers, 1949), Underwood said that she did not want to work outside the home, and that she had no idea where to look for a job.  As it turned out, a job found her. The day following the stockings argument Underwood's friend, Evelyn Connors, called and asked her if she would be interested in a temporary job on the switchboard at the ''Record''. Underwood seized the opportunity, and thus began her career in the newspaper business.\n\n== ''Los Angeles Record'' ==\n\nIn October 1926, Underwood began her job as the switchboard operator at the ''Los Angeles Record''. It was at the ''Record'' that Underwood learned the newspaper business from the ground up.  She was a quick study and worked hard at any task to which she was assigned. She assisted Gertrude Price, who wrote a woman's column under the pseudonym of Cynthia Grey, in the Christmas basket program for the poor. Price recognized Underwood's innate talent and became Underwood's mentor. In December 1927 [[William Edward Hickman]] kidnapped, murdered, and then butchered twelve-year-old [[Marion Parker]].  Hickman was on the run when Underwood saw the [[United Press]] flash that he had been captured in Oregon. Underwood telephoned her husband with the news. Price overheard the call and reprimanded Underwood for talking about a story outside of the newsroom before it was in print.  Underwood never made that mistake again.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nUnderwood worked her way up to reporter at the ''Record'', and her first by-line was an interview with an elderly man who was credited with having planted the first cotton in California.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nUnderwood's first major crime reporting began on May 20, 1931, when Los Angeles was shaken by the murders of Charles H. Crawford and Herbert F. Spencer.  Crawford was a former saloon keeper and was a power behind the scenes in the city's government. Spencer was a former police reporter who had become associated with the ''Critic of Critics'', a political crusading weekly. The day following the murders thirty-three-year-old David H. Clark, a former deputy District Attorney and candidate for municipal judge, surrendered himself to the District Attorney and admitted to the murders.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nUnderwood had noticed a couple of gaps in the coverage of the murders. She thought it odd that no one had interviewed Clark's parents. Underwood managed to locate them and they gave her an exclusive interview and photographs.  Underwood's interview with Clark's parents appeared in the paper under the headline \"Mrs. Clark Says Son is Innocent\", earning her a double column by-line.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nUnderwood was given an increasing number of major stories to cover for the ''Record'', and her reputation as a reporter grew.  She was offered a job at [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Herald-Express]]'', but she turned it down. The ''Herald-Express'' expected her to provide her own automobile, but she did not own a car. In addition, she felt that she was gaining valuable experience in every aspect of the newspaper business at the perennially short-staffed ''Record'', and she worried that she would be more constricted at the ''Herald-Express''.\n\nEarly in January 1935 the ''Herald-Express'' again offered Underwood a job. She had decided to decline the offer when a couple of days later she learned that the ''Record'' had been sold to the ''Illustrated Daily News''. Despite assurances that her position would be safe, Underwood decided to accept the offer to work for the ''Herald-Express''.\n\n== ''Herald-Express'' ==\n\nUnderwood's first assignment for the ''Herald-Express'' was to interview [[Amelia Earhart]]. The aviator had successfully completed a historic solo flight from [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, to [[Oakland, California]]. Underwood staked out Earhart's North Hollywood home for several hours before she turned up. The interview was worth the wait; Underwood discovered that she was the only ''Herald-Express'' reporter who had caught up with Earhart.\n\nThree weeks after she began working at the ''Herald-Express'', Underwood drew photographer Perry Fowler for a story on the rape of a sixteen-year-old girl. Underwood and Fowler worked together regularly after that and were unofficially regarded as a team.  They made the early morning rounds (called \"milk runs\") of local jails. They visited the Lincoln Heights jail almost daily, ferreting out crimes and scandals on which to report.\n\nAmong the stories Underwood covered over the next twelve years were the untimely deaths of Hollywood stars [[Thelma Todd]] (whose autopsy she attended) and [[Jean Harlow]].  She wrote a series of articles on the lives of the women incarcerated in the California women's prison at Tehachapi, and she would report on nearly every major murder case in the city, culminating with the infamous murder of twenty-two-year-old [[Elizabeth Short]] in January 1947.<ref name=Underwood /> she also reported on the case of Nellie Madison who was convicted of shooting and killing her husband on March 24, 1935. At first Underwood assumed Madison was guilty because she was married five times and produced no children from the marriage. She eventually became an advocate for Madison and garnered outcry of letters which had Madison's conviction from death to life in prison.\n\nOn January 15, 1947, the bisected body of a young woman was found in Leimert Park near thirty-ninth and Norton.  According to Underwood, she was the first reporter to arrive at the body dump site. The dead woman was soon identified as Elizabeth Short from Medford, Massachusetts. Underwood stated in her autobiography, ''Newspaperwoman'', that the popularization of Short's \"[[Black Dahlia]]\" nickname was the result of information she had received from a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nIn the midst of reporting on the Black Dahlia case, Underwood was promoted to city editor of the ''Herald-Express''.  Underwood said that she had been pulled from reporting on the case twice, each time without warning, or explanation.  The second time she was informed that her new assignment was as editor of the city desk.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nWielding a sawed-off baseball bat and a starter pistol, Underwood ran a staff of hard-nosed reporters and photographers who called her \"Aggie\" (the nickname she had acquired while working at the ''Record'') until her retirement in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Press: And a Damn Good Cook|magazine=Time Magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827422,00.html|accessdate=January 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== CBS lawsuit ==\n\nOn April 22, 1981, Underwood's attorney, Caryl Warner, filed a $110 million defamation lawsuit against author Ovid Demaris and publisher Times Books over a passage in ''The Last Mafioso''.<ref name=Demaris>{{cite book|last=Demaris|first=Ovid|title=The Last Mafioso: The Treacherous World of Jimmy (\"The Weasel\") Fratianno|year=2010|publisher=Ishi Press|isbn=978-4-87187329-1}}</ref>  The book related the life story of mobster Jimmy \"The Weasel\" Fratianno.  The contested passage referred to an incident in the late 1940s involving gangster [[Mickey Cohen]].  According to Fratianno, Cohen had pocketed $1&nbsp;million from contributors to the Israeli cause by planting a false story in the ''Herald-Express'' stating that the ship carrying the money had gone down at sea. Fratianno was quoted as saying:\n\n\"[Cohen's] got this broad at the Herald, Aggie Underwood. She's a big editor there and this broad would walk on hot coals for Mickey.  Prints any shit he gives her. The way I see it, Mickey called her and made up a story about buying guns and ammunition for the Jews and told her the boat sank.\"<ref name=Demaris />\n\nFratianno repeated the story to interviewer [[Mike Wallace]] on the [[CBS]] television show ''[[60 Minutes]]'', and the lawsuit was expanded to include Wallace et al.<ref name=Saito />\n\nAccording to Underwood, she did not know Cohen until the early 1950s, a few years after the alleged incident. Underwood never denied being friends with Cohen, and she admitted that he was often a news source; in fact, Cohen had obtained the [[Lana Turner]]-Johnny Stompanato letters for Underwood after Turner's daughter, Cheryl, had been indicted for the stabbing death of Stompanato on April 4, 1958.<ref name=Cohen />\n\nUnderwood died before the lawsuit could go to trial. The suit was later dropped by her family.\n\n== Later life and death ==\n\nIn 1981, and in failing health, Underwood moved from Los Angeles to [[Greeley, Colorado]], to live near her son and grandchildren.  On July 3, 1984, she suffered a fatal heart attack.  Underwood's funeral was held at St. James Episcopal Church in downtown Los Angeles on July 7, 1984.<ref name=Cohen />\n\nFollowing her death, Underwood was eulogized in all of the local newspapers. The ''Herald-Examiner'' said:\n\n\"She was undeterred by the grisliest of crime scenes and had a knack for getting details that eluded other reporters.  As editor, she knew the names and telephone numbers of numerous celebrities, in addition to all the bars her reporters frequented.\nShe cultivated the day's best sources, ranging from gangsters and prostitutes to movie stars and government officials.\"<ref name=Cohen />\n\nUnderwood is buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]], [[Glendale, California]], in the Court of Freedom, Sanctuary of Affection, crypt 1239.\n\n== Television and film ==\nOn November 11, 1956, Underwood was the subject of an episode of the television program ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.  She was also the subject  of a 2017 film documentary entitled \u201cAgness Underwood: First Lady of the Newsroom.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://sundial.csun.edu/2017/03/documentary-screening-centers-agness-underwood-first-lady-of-the-newsroom/ |title = Documentary screening centers 'Agness Underwood: First Lady of the Newsroom'}}</ref>\n\n== Honors, citations, awards, and career highlights ==\n\n*March 31, 1949.

The Wilson family's frequent moves were determined by where Clifford could find work.  In November 1907, Mamie died in childbirth.<ref name=Saito />  Clifford's work required him to travel, which made it impossible for him to care for the girls on his own.  Underwood and her younger sister were handed over to relatives in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], to be raised. Underwood recalled that she and her sister did not stay in Terre Haute and that they moved frequently, often winding up in the hands of public charity.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nClifford became distressed with the way his daughters were being treated and found two foster homes in [[Portland, Indiana]], each willing to take one of the girls. Underwood's sister was sent to live with a farm family. Underwood's new home was with Charles and Belle Ewry and their three sons. She and the eldest of the three sons, Ralph, liked each other immediately. Ralph Ewry became her friend and protector.  Underwood later described the Ewry household as a serious environment, made bearable only by Ralph's kindness.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nUnderwood did well in school and skipped three grades; however, by the time she entered high school in 1916 her enthusiasm for her studies had waned and she dropped out in the tenth grade. Underwood took as job as a clerk in the basement of Cartwright's department store in Portland, Indiana. She became increasingly unhappy living with the Ewrys, particularly following Ralph's deployment overseas as a soldier during World War I.  Ralph sensed Underwood's discontent in her letters to him and, believing that she might be better off with a blood relative, managed to locate one of her distant relatives in San Francisco.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nUnderwood arrived in San Francisco in November 1918, and moved in with her relative who lived in an apartment on Geary Street.  Underwood knew she would be expected to contribute to household expenses and set out to find a job.  After a few frustrating days of unsuccessful job hunting, she arrived at the apartment only to discover that her relative had moved out leaving Underwood broke, alone, and homeless.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nAnother of Underwood's female relatives invited her to move to [[Hollywood]], California, and live with her.  Soon after her arrival it became clear that Underwood's relative was interested only in transforming the girl into a child star. When that plan failed, the relative put Underwood out on the street.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nUnderwood became a resident at the [[Salvation Army]]'s home for working women in downtown Los Angeles and got a job at the [[The Broadway|Broadway Department Store]].  It was there that she met Evelyn Conners, a woman a few months her junior, who would become her lifelong friend.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nFollowing a brief move to [[Salt Lake City]], Utah, Underwood returned to Los Angeles, where she found work as a waitress at the Pig \u2018n Whistle restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. One day in April 1920, she was lamenting to Harry Underwood, a co-worker, that her Hollywood relative had resurfaced and demanded that Underwood live with her again and relinquish her paychecks to her, or she would turn the underage girl over to the authorities. Harry told her that the relative could not do that if he and Underwood were married. The couple married three weeks later on April 28, 1920.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nBy 1926, Underwood and her husband had become parents to a daughter and son.  Underwood's husband and sister worked outside the home, but the family still struggled to make ends meet.  One of the small economies that Underwood practiced was to wear her sister's hand-me-down silk stockings. One day Underwood asked her husband for the money to buy a new pair of stockings, but he demurred. An argument ensued and Underwood told her husband that if he would not give her money for stockings, she would get a job and earn them herself.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nIn her autobiography, ''Newspaperwoman'' (Harper Brothers, 1949), Underwood said that she did not want to work outside the home, and that she had no idea where to look for a job.  As it turned out, a job found her. The day following the stockings argument Underwood's friend, Evelyn Connors, called and asked her if she would be interested in a temporary job on the switchboard at the ''Record''. Underwood seized the opportunity, and thus began her career in the newspaper business.\n\n== ''Los Angeles Record'' ==\n\nIn October 1926, Underwood began her job as the switchboard operator at the ''Los Angeles Record''. It was at the ''Record'' that Underwood learned the newspaper business from the ground up.  She was a quick study and worked hard at any task to which she was assigned. She assisted Gertrude Price, who wrote a woman's column under the pseudonym of Cynthia Grey, in the Christmas basket program for the poor. Price recognized Underwood's innate talent and became Underwood's mentor. In December 1927 [[William Edward Hickman]] kidnapped, murdered, and then butchered twelve-year-old [[Marion Parker]].  Hickman was on the run when Underwood saw the [[United Press]] flash that he had been captured in Oregon. Underwood telephoned her husband with the news. Price overheard the call and reprimanded Underwood for talking about a story outside of the newsroom before it was in print.  Underwood never made that mistake again.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nUnderwood worked her way up to reporter at the ''Record'', and her first by-line was an interview with an elderly man who was credited with having planted the first cotton in California.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nUnderwood's first major crime reporting began on May 20, 1931, when Los Angeles was shaken by the murders of Charles H. Crawford and Herbert F. Spencer.  Crawford was a former saloon keeper and was a power behind the scenes in the city's government. Spencer was a former police reporter who had become associated with the ''Critic of Critics'', a political crusading weekly. The day following the murders thirty-three-year-old David H. Clark, a former deputy District Attorney and candidate for municipal judge, surrendered himself to the District Attorney and admitted to the murders.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nUnderwood had noticed a couple of gaps in the coverage of the murders. She thought it odd that no one had interviewed Clark's parents. Underwood managed to locate them and they gave her an exclusive interview and photographs.  Underwood's interview with Clark's parents appeared in the paper under the headline \"Mrs. Clark Says Son is Innocent\", earning her a double column by-line.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nUnderwood was given an increasing number of major stories to cover for the ''Record'', and her reputation as a reporter grew.  She was offered a job at [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Herald-Express]]'', but she turned it down. The ''Herald-Express'' expected her to provide her own automobile, but she did not own a car. In addition, she felt that she was gaining valuable experience in every aspect of the newspaper business at the perennially short-staffed ''Record'', and she worried that she would be more constricted at the ''Herald-Express''.\n\nEarly in January 1935 the ''Herald-Express'' again offered Underwood a job. She had decided to decline the offer when a couple of days later she learned that the ''Record'' had been sold to the ''Illustrated Daily News''. Despite assurances that her position would be safe, Underwood decided to accept the offer to work for the ''Herald-Express''.\n\n== ''Herald-Express'' ==\n\nUnderwood's first assignment for the ''Herald-Express'' was to interview [[Amelia Earhart]]. The aviator had successfully completed a historic solo flight from [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, to [[Oakland, California]]. Underwood staked out Earhart's North Hollywood home for several hours before she turned up. The interview was worth the wait; Underwood discovered that she was the only ''Herald-Express'' reporter who had caught up with Earhart.\n\nThree weeks after she began working at the ''Herald-Express'', Underwood drew photographer Perry Fowler for a story on the rape of a sixteen-year-old girl. Underwood and Fowler worked together regularly after that and were unofficially regarded as a team.  They made the early morning rounds (called \"milk runs\") of local jails. They visited the Lincoln Heights jail almost daily, ferreting out crimes and scandals on which to report.\n\nAmong the stories Underwood covered over the next twelve years were the untimely deaths of Hollywood stars [[Thelma Todd]] (whose autopsy she attended) and [[Jean Harlow]].  She wrote a series of articles on the lives of the women incarcerated in the California women's prison at Tehachapi, and she would report on nearly every major murder case in the city, culminating with the infamous murder of twenty-two-year-old [[Elizabeth Short]] in January 1947.<ref name=Underwood /> she also reported on the case of Nellie Madison who was convicted of shooting and killing her husband on March 24, 1935. At first Underwood assumed Madison was guilty because she was married five times and produced no children from the marriage. She eventually became an advocate for Madison and garnered outcry of letters which had Madison's conviction from death to life in prison.\n\nOn January 15, 1947, the bisected body of a young woman was found in Leimert Park near thirty-ninth and Norton.  According to Underwood, she was the first reporter to arrive at the body dump site. The dead woman was soon identified as Elizabeth Short from Medford, Massachusetts. Underwood stated in her autobiography, ''Newspaperwoman'', that the popularization of Short's \"[[Black Dahlia]]\" nickname was the result of information she had received from a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective.<ref name=Underwood />\n\nIn the midst of reporting on the Black Dahlia case, Underwood was promoted to city editor of the ''Herald-Express''.  Underwood said that she had been pulled from reporting on the case twice, each time without warning, or explanation.  The second time she was informed that her new assignment was as editor of the city desk.<ref name=Underwood /><ref name=Saito />\n\nWielding a sawed-off baseball bat and a starter pistol, Underwood ran a staff of hard-nosed reporters and photographers who called her \"Aggie\" (the nickname she had acquired while working at the ''Record'') until her retirement in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Press: And a Damn Good Cook|magazine=Time Magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827422,00.html|accessdate=January 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== CBS lawsuit ==\n\nOn April 22, 1981, Underwood's attorney, Caryl Warner, filed a $110 million defamation lawsuit against author Ovid Demaris and publisher Times Books over a passage in ''The Last Mafioso''.<ref name=Demaris>{{cite book|last=Demaris|first=Ovid|title=The Last Mafioso: The Treacherous World of Jimmy (\"The Weasel\") Fratianno|year=2010|publisher=Ishi Press|isbn=978-4-87187329-1}}</ref>  The book related the life story of mobster Jimmy \"The Weasel\" Fratianno.  The contested passage referred to an incident in the late 1940s involving gangster [[Mickey Cohen]].  According to Fratianno, Cohen had pocketed $1&nbsp;million from contributors to the Israeli cause by planting a false story in the ''Herald-Express'' stating that the ship carrying the money had gone down at sea. Fratianno was quoted as saying:\n\n\"[Cohen's] got this broad at the Herald, Aggie Underwood. She's a big editor there and this broad would walk on hot coals for Mickey.  Prints any shit he gives her. The way I see it, Mickey called her and made up a story about buying guns and ammunition for the Jews and told her the boat sank.\"<ref name=Demaris />\n\nFratianno repeated the story to interviewer [[Mike Wallace]] on the [[CBS]] television show ''[[60 Minutes]]'', and the lawsuit was expanded to include Wallace et al.<ref name=Saito />\n\nAccording to Underwood, she did not know Cohen until the early 1950s, a few years after the alleged incident. Underwood never denied being friends with Cohen, and she admitted that he was often a news source; in fact, Cohen had obtained the [[Lana Turner]]-Johnny Stompanato letters for Underwood after Turner's daughter, Cheryl, had been indicted for the stabbing death of Stompanato on April 4, 1958.<ref name=Cohen />\n\nUnderwood died before the lawsuit could go to trial. The suit was later dropped by her family.\n\n== Later life and death ==\n\nIn 1981, and in failing health, Underwood moved from Los Angeles to [[Greeley, Colorado]], to live near her son and grandchildren.  On July 3, 1984, she suffered a fatal heart attack.  Underwood's funeral was held at St. James Episcopal Church in downtown Los Angeles on July 7, 1984.<ref name=Cohen />\n\nFollowing her death, Underwood was eulogized in all of the local newspapers. The ''Herald-Examiner'' said:\n\n\"She was undeterred by the grisliest of crime scenes and had a knack for getting details that eluded other reporters.  As editor, she knew the names and telephone numbers of numerous celebrities, in addition to all the bars her reporters frequented.\nShe cultivated the day's best sources, ranging from gangsters and prostitutes to movie stars and government officials.\"<ref name=Cohen />\n\nUnderwood is buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]], [[Glendale, California]], in the Court of Freedom, Sanctuary of Affection, crypt 1239.\n\n== Television and film ==\nOn November 11, 1956, Underwood was the subject of an episode of the television program ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.  She was also the subject  of a 2017 film documentary entitled \u201cAgness Underwood: First Lady of the Newsroom.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://sundial.csun.edu/2017/03/documentary-screening-centers-agness-underwood-first-lady-of-the-newsroom/ |title = Documentary screening centers 'Agness Underwood: First Lady of the Newsroom'}}</ref>\n\n== Honors, citations, awards, and career highlights ==\n\n*March 31, 1949.

Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduction of conflicts, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.\n\n\"Psychological peace\" (such as a peaceful thinking and emotions) is perhaps less well defined yet often a necessary precursor to establishing \"behavioral peace.\"  Peaceful behavior sometimes results from a \"peaceful inner disposition.\"  Some have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with a certain quality of inner tranquility that does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life for its existence.<ref>[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11559-world-peace-must-develop-from-inner-peace-peace-is-not Dalai Lama XIV: Quotable Quotes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917123327/https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11559-world-peace-must-develop-from-inner-peace-peace-is-not |date=17 September 2017 }} Goodreads.

The early English term is also used in the sense of \"[[Silence|quiet]]\", reflecting calm, serene, and meditative approaches to family or group relationships that avoid quarreling and seek [[tranquility]] \u2014 an absence of disturbance or agitation.\n\nIn many languages, the word for peace is also used as a greeting or a farewell, for example the Hawaiian word [[aloha]], as well as the Arabic word ''salaam''. In English the word peace is occasionally used as a farewell, especially for the dead, as in the phrase ''[[rest in peace]]''.\n\n[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]] in his research project which led to the book ''The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies'' (2011) maps the different meanings of peace in different languages and from different regions across the world. Later, in his ''Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture'' (2012), he groups the different meanings of peace into five peace families: Energetic/Harmony, Moral/Justice, Modern/Security, Postmodern/Truth, and Transrational, a synthesis of the positive sides of the four previous families and the society.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Kroisos BMC 31.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|[[croeseid|Croeseid coin]] of [[Croesus]] c.550 BC, depicting the Lion and Bull \u2013 partly symbolizing alliance between Lydia and Greece, respectively.]]In ancient times and more recently, peaceful alliances between different nations were codified through royal marriages.

The union of [[Phrygia]] / [[Lydia]] with [[Aeolis|Aeolian Greeks]] resulted in regional peace, which facilitated the transfer of ground-breaking technological skills into Ancient Greece; respectively, the [[Phoenician alphabet|phonetic written script]] and the minting of [[History of coins|coinage]] (to use a token currency, where the value is guaranteed by the state).<ref>Amelia Dowler, Curator, British Museum; A History of the World; http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/7cEz771FSeOLptGIElaquA</ref> Both inventions were rapidly adopted by surrounding nations through further trade and cooperation and have been of fundamental benefit to the progress of civilization.\n\nSince classical times, it has been noted that peace has sometimes been achieved by the victor over the vanquished by the imposition of ruthless measures. In his book ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] includes eloquent and vicious polemics against the rapacity and greed of Rome. One, that Tacitus says is by the [[Caledonia]]n chieftain [[Calgacus]], ends ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. \u2014 Oxford Revised Translation).\n\nDiscussion of peace is therefore at the same time a discussion on the form of such peace. Is it simple absence of mass organized killing (war) or does peace require a particular morality and justice? (''just peace'').<ref>\u0160mihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'', p. 129, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.</ref>\nA peace must be seen at least in two forms:\n* A simple silence of arms, absence of [[war]].\n* Absence of war accompanied by particular requirements for the mutual settlement of relations, which are characterized by terms such as justice, mutual respect, respect for law and good will.\n\nMore recently, advocates for radical reform in justice systems have called for a public policy adoption of non-punitive, non-violent [[Restorative Justice]] methods, and many of those studying the success of these methods, including a [http://cpcjalliance.org/themes/restorative-justice-working-group/ United Nations working group on Restorative Justice], have attempted to re-define justice in terms related to peace.

The UN was founded in 1945 after World War II to replace the League of Nations, to stop wars between countries, and to provide a platform for dialogue.\n\nThe UN, after approval by the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], sends [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states of the UN. The forces, also called the \"Blue Helmets\", who enforce UN accords are awarded [[United Nations Medal]]s, which are considered [[international decoration]]s instead of [[military decoration]]s.

It was created at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], and emerged from the advocacy of [[Woodrow Wilson]] and other idealists during World War I. The Covenant of the League of Nations was included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, and the League was based in [[Geneva]] until its dissolution as a result of World War II and replacement by the United Nations. The high hopes widely held for the League in the 1920s, for example amongst members of the [[League of Nations Union]], gave way to widespread disillusion in the 1930s as the League struggled to respond to challenges from Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Japan. \n\nOne of the most important scholars of the League of Nations was Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]]. Like many of the other British enthusiasts for the League, such as [[Gilbert Murray]] and [[Florence Stawell]] \u2013 the so-called \"Greece and peace\" set \u2013 he came to this from the study of the [[classics]].\n\nThe creation of the League of Nations, and the hope for informed public opinion on international issues (expressed for example by the [[Union for Democratic Control]] during World War I), also saw the creation after World War I of bodies dedicated to understanding international affairs, such as the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York and the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] at [[Chatham House]] in London. At the same time, the academic study of international relations started to professionalize, with the creation of the first professorship of international politics, named for Woodrow Wilson, at [[Aberystwyth]], Wales, in 1919.\n\n===Olympic Games===\nThe late 19th century idealist advocacy of peace which led to the creation of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], and ultimately the [[League of Nations]], also saw the re-emergence of the ancient Olympic ideal.

Pacifism covers a spectrum of views ranging from the belief that international disputes can and should all be resolved via peaceful behaviors; to calls for the abolition of various organizations which tend to institutionalize aggressive behaviors, such as the military, or arms manufacturers; to opposition to any organization of society that might rely in any way upon governmental force.  Such groups which sometimes oppose the governmental use of force include [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarchists]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]].  Absolute pacifism opposes violent behavior under all circumstance, including defense of self and others.\n\nPacifism may be based on [[morality|moral]] principles (a [[deontological]] view) or [[pragmatism]] (a [[consequentialist]] view).

Within the meditative traditions, the psychological or inward achievement of \"peace of mind\" is often associated with bliss and happiness.\n\nPeace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress.

He deployed satyagraha techniques in campaigns for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] and also during his earlier struggles in [[South Africa]].\n\nThe word ''satyagraha'' itself was coined through a public contest that Gandhi sponsored through the newspaper he published in South Africa, 'Indian Opinion', when he realized that neither the common, contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict. According to Gandhi's autobiography, the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi (presumably no relation), who submitted the entry 'sadagraha', which Gandhi then modified to 'satyagraha'. Etymologically, this Hindic word means 'truth-firmness', and is commonly translated as 'steadfastness in the truth' or 'truth-force'.\n\nSatyagraha theory also influenced [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] during the campaigns he led during the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States. The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: \"They say, 'means are, after all, means'. I would say, 'means are, after all, everything'. As the means so the end...\"<ref>R.K. Prabhu & U.R.

Exponents of this view have included [[Metternich]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], and [[Henry Kissinger]]. A related approach \u2013 more in the tradition of [[Hugo Grotius]] than [[Thomas Hobbes]] \u2013 was articulated by the so-called \"[[English school of international relations theory]]\" such as [[Martin Wight]] in his book ''Power Politics'' (1946, 1978) and [[Hedley Bull]] in ''The Anarchical Society'' (1977).\n\nAs the maintenance of a balance of power could in some circumstances require a willingness to go to war, some critics saw the idea of a balance of power as promoting war rather than promoting peace. This was a radical critique of those supporters of the Allied and Associated Powers who justified entry into World War I on the grounds that it was necessary to preserve the balance of power in Europe from a German bid for [[hegemony]].\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, and especially during the [[cold war]], a particular form of balance of power \u2013 mutual nuclear deterrence \u2013 emerged as a widely held doctrine on the key to peace between the great powers. Critics argued that the development of nuclear stockpiles increased the chances of war rather than peace, and that the \"nuclear umbrella\" made it \"safe\" for smaller wars (e.g. the [[Vietnam war]] and the Soviet invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] to end the [[Prague Spring]]), so making such wars more likely.\n\n===Free trade, interdependence and globalization===\n{{main|Doux commerce|Peace economics}}\nIt was a central tenet of [[classical liberalism]], for example among English liberal thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century, that free trade promoted peace. For example, the Cambridge economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883\u20131946) said that he was \"brought up\" on this idea and held it unquestioned until at least the 1920s.<ref>Quoted from [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 2.</ref> During the [[economic globalization]] in the decades leading up to World War I, writers such as [[Norman Angell]] argued that the growth of economic interdependence between the great powers made war between them futile and therefore unlikely. He made this argument in 1913. A year later Europe's economically interconnected states were embroiled in what would later become known as the First World War.<ref>https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2019/01/14/the-end-of-the-great-illusion-norman-angell-and-the-founding-of-nato/index.html</ref>\n\nThese ideas have again come to prominence among liberal internationalists during the globalization of the late 20th and early 21st century.<ref>For sources, see articles on [[liberalism]] and [[classical liberalism]].</ref> These ideas have seen [[capitalism]] as consistent with, even conducive to, peace.\n\n=== Game theory ===\n{{Main|Peace war game}}\n\nThe ''Peace & War Game'' is an approach in [[game theory]] to understand the relationship between peace and conflicts.\n\nThe [[iterated game]] hypotheses was originally used by academic groups and [[computer simulation]]s to study possible strategies of [[cooperation]] and [[aggression]].<ref>Shy, O., 1996, ''[[industrial organization|Industrial Organization]]: Theory and Applications'', Cambridge, Mass.: The [[MIT]] Press.</ref>\n\nAs peace makers became richer over time, it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated. One of the well studied [[strategy|strategies]] that acquired wealth more rapidly was based on [[Genghis Khan]], i.e. a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources. This led, in contrast, to the development of what's known as the \"provokable nice guy [[strategy]]\", a peace-maker until attacked, improved upon merely to win by occasional forgiveness even when attacked. By adding the results of all pairwise games for each player, one sees that multiple players gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding a constantly aggressive player.<ref name=Miller>N.R. Miller, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4235437 \"Nice Strategies Finish First: A Review of ''The Evolution of Cooperation''\"], ''[[Politics and the Life Sciences]]'', [[Association for Politics and the Life Sciences]], 1985.</ref>\n\n===Socialism and managed capitalism===\nSocialist, communist, and left-wing liberal writers of the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g., [[Lenin]], [[J.A. Hobson]], [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]) argued that capitalism caused war (e.g. through promoting imperial or other economic rivalries that lead to international conflict). This led some to argue that international socialism was the key to peace.\n\nHowever, in response to such writers in the 1930s who argued that capitalism caused war, the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883\u20131946) argued that managed capitalism could promote peace. This involved international coordination of fiscal/monetary policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against each other, and a high degree of freedom of trade. These ideas underlay Keynes's work during World War II that led to the creation of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] at [[Breton Woods, New Jersey|Bretton Woods]] in 1944, and later of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (subsequently the [[World Trade Organization]]).<ref>. See [[Donald Markwell]]. ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Theory of 'active peace'===\nBorrowing from the teachings of Norwegian theorist [[Johan Galtung]], one of the pioneers of the field of [[Peace and conflict studies|Peace Research]], on 'Positive Peace',<ref>Galtung, J: ''Peace by peaceful means: peace and conflict, development and civilization'', page 32. Sage Publications, 1996.</ref> and on the writings of Maine Quaker [[Gray Cox]], a consortium of theorists, activists, and practitioners in the experimental [[John Woolman College]] initiative have arrived at a theory of \"active peace\". This theory posits in part that peace is part of a triad, which also includes justice and wholeness (or well-being), an interpretation consonant with scriptural scholarly interpretations of the meaning of the early Hebrew word ''shalom''.  Furthermore, the consortium have integrated Galtung's teaching of the meanings of the terms peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding, to also fit into a triadic and interdependent formulation or structure. Vermont Quaker John V. Wilmerding posits five stages of growth applicable to individuals, communities, and societies, whereby one transcends first the 'surface' awareness that most people have of these kinds of issues, emerging successively into acquiescence, pacifism, passive resistance, active resistance, and finally into ''active peace'', dedicating themselves to peacemaking, peacekeeping or peace building.<ref>{{cite web | last = Wilmerding | first = John | title = The Theory of Active Peace | url = http://internationalpeaceandconflict.ning.com/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace | accessdate = 7 February 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090620023950/http://internationalpeaceandconflict.ning.com/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace | archivedate = 20 June 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===International organization and law===\nOne of the most influential theories of peace, especially since [[Woodrow Wilson]] led the creation of the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, is that peace will be advanced if the intentional anarchy of states is replaced through the growth of [[international law]] promoted and enforced through international organizations such as the League of Nations, the [[United Nations]], and other functional international organizations. One of the most important early exponents of this view was Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]], for example in his 1936 book ''The League of Nations and the Rule of Law''.<ref>Macmillan, 1936.</ref>\n\n===Trans-national solidarity===\nMany \"idealist\" thinkers about international relations \u2013 e.g. in the traditions of [[Kant]] and [[Karl Marx]] \u2013 have argued that the key to peace is the growth of some form of [[solidarity]] between peoples (or classes of people) spanning the lines of cleavage between nations or states that lead to war.<ref>See, e.g., Sir [[Harry Hinsley]]. ''Power and the Pursuit of Peace'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962.</ref>\n\nOne version of this is the idea of promoting international understanding between nations through the international mobility of students \u2013 an idea most powerfully advanced by [[Cecil Rhodes]] in the creation of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], and his successors such as [[J. William Fulbright]].<ref>Discussed above. See, e.g., [[Donald Markwell]]. ''\"Instincts to Lead\": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'' (2013).</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that peace can be developed among countries on the basis of active management of water resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strategicforesight.com/publications.php#.WBm94-V94dU|title=Publications \u2013 Strategic Foresight Group, Think Tank, Global Policy, Global affairs research, Water Conflict studies, global policy strategies, strategic policy group, global future studies|website=strategicforesight.com|access-date=2 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101013118/http://strategicforesight.com/publications.php#.WBm94-V94dU#.WBm94-V94dU|archive-date=1 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Lyotard post-modernism===\nFollowing [[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]], Wolfgang S\u00fctzl<ref>[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]/Wolfgang S\u00fctzl: A Call for Many Peaces; in: Dietrich, Wolfgang, Josefina Echavarr\u00eda Alvarez, Norbert Koppensteiner eds.: Key Texts of Peace Studies; LIT M\u00fcnster, Vienna, 2006</ref> and the [[Innsbruck School of Peace Studies]], some peace thinkers have abandoned any single and all-encompassing definition of peace. Rather, they promote the idea of ''many peaces''. They argue that since no singular, correct definition of peace can exist, peace should be perceived as a plurality. This post-modern understanding of peace(s) was based on the philosophy of [[Jean Francois Lyotard]]. It served as a fundament for the more recent concept of trans-rational peace(s) and elicitive conflict transformation.\n\nIn 2008 Dietrich enlarged his approach of the ''many peaces'' to the so-called ''five families'' of peace interpretations: the energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational approach.<ref>[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]: Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture; Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2012</ref> Trans-rationality unites the rational and mechanistic understanding of modern peace in a relational and culture-based manner with spiritual narratives and energetic interpretations.<ref>[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]], Josefina Echavarr\u00eda Alvarez, Gustavo Esteva, Daniela Ingruber, Norbert Koppensteiner eds.: The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies.

In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of [[social conflict|conflict]] (such as [[war]]) and freedom from [[fear]] of [[violence]] between individuals or [[social group|groups]]. Throughout history leaders have used [[peacemaking]] and [[diplomacy]] to establish a certain type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of [[List of periods of regional peace|regional peace]] or economic growth through various forms of agreements or [[peace treaty|peace treaties]].  Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduction of conflicts, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.\n\n\"Psychological peace\" (such as a peaceful thinking and emotions) is perhaps less well defined yet often a necessary precursor to establishing \"behavioral peace.\"  Peaceful behavior sometimes results from a \"peaceful inner disposition.\"  Some have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with a certain quality of inner tranquility that does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life for its existence.<ref>[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11559-world-peace-must-develop-from-inner-peace-peace-is-not Dalai Lama XIV: Quotable Quotes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917123327/https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11559-world-peace-must-develop-from-inner-peace-peace-is-not |date=17 September 2017 }} Goodreads.

The term-'peace' originates most recently from the Anglo-French ''pes,'' and the Old French ''pais'', meaning \"peace, reconciliation, silence, agreement\" (11th century).<ref>Online Etymology Dictionary, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=peace&allowed_in_frame=0 \"Peace\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214011459/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=peace&allowed_in_frame=0 |date=14 December 2013 }}.</ref>\n\nThis latter understanding of peace can also pertain to an individual's introspective sense or concept of her/himself, as in being \"at peace\" in one's own mind, as found in European references from c.1200. The early English term is also used in the sense of \"[[Silence|quiet]]\", reflecting calm, serene, and meditative approaches to family or group relationships that avoid quarreling and seek [[tranquility]] \u2014 an absence of disturbance or agitation.\n\nIn many languages, the word for peace is also used as a greeting or a farewell, for example the Hawaiian word [[aloha]], as well as the Arabic word ''salaam''. In English the word peace is occasionally used as a farewell, especially for the dead, as in the phrase ''[[rest in peace]]''.\n\n[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]] in his research project which led to the book ''The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies'' (2011) maps the different meanings of peace in different languages and from different regions across the world. Later, in his ''Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture'' (2012), he groups the different meanings of peace into five peace families: Energetic/Harmony, Moral/Justice, Modern/Security, Postmodern/Truth, and Transrational, a synthesis of the positive sides of the four previous families and the society.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Kroisos BMC 31.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|[[croeseid|Croeseid coin]] of [[Croesus]] c.550 BC, depicting the Lion and Bull \u2013 partly symbolizing alliance between Lydia and Greece, respectively.]]In ancient times and more recently, peaceful alliances between different nations were codified through royal marriages. Two examples, [[Hermodike I]] c.800BC<ref>The Cambridge Ancient History, edited by John Boederman, Cambridge University Press, 1997, pg 832</ref> and [[Hermodike II]] c.600BC<ref>Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology, Martin Nilsson, 1983 Univ of California Press, p. 48.</ref> were Greek princesses from the house of [[Agamemnon]] who married kings from what is now Central Turkey. The union of [[Phrygia]] / [[Lydia]] with [[Aeolis|Aeolian Greeks]] resulted in regional peace, which facilitated the transfer of ground-breaking technological skills into Ancient Greece; respectively, the [[Phoenician alphabet|phonetic written script]] and the minting of [[History of coins|coinage]] (to use a token currency, where the value is guaranteed by the state).<ref>Amelia Dowler, Curator, British Museum; A History of the World; http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/7cEz771FSeOLptGIElaquA</ref> Both inventions were rapidly adopted by surrounding nations through further trade and cooperation and have been of fundamental benefit to the progress of civilization.\n\nSince classical times, it has been noted that peace has sometimes been achieved by the victor over the vanquished by the imposition of ruthless measures. In his book ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] includes eloquent and vicious polemics against the rapacity and greed of Rome. One, that Tacitus says is by the [[Caledonia]]n chieftain [[Calgacus]], ends ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. \u2014 Oxford Revised Translation).\n\nDiscussion of peace is therefore at the same time a discussion on the form of such peace. Is it simple absence of mass organized killing (war) or does peace require a particular morality and justice? (''just peace'').<ref>\u0160mihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'', p. 129, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.</ref>\nA peace must be seen at least in two forms:\n* A simple silence of arms, absence of [[war]].\n* Absence of war accompanied by particular requirements for the mutual settlement of relations, which are characterized by terms such as justice, mutual respect, respect for law and good will.\n\nMore recently, advocates for radical reform in justice systems have called for a public policy adoption of non-punitive, non-violent [[Restorative Justice]] methods, and many of those studying the success of these methods, including a [http://cpcjalliance.org/themes/restorative-justice-working-group/ United Nations working group on Restorative Justice], have attempted to re-define justice in terms related to peace. From the late 2000s on, a Theory of Active Peace has been proposed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalpeaceandconflict.org/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace#.VbOntbNVhBc|title=The Theory of Active Peace|work=internationalpeaceandconflict.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725235108/http://www.internationalpeaceandconflict.org/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace#.VbOntbNVhBc|archivedate=25 July 2015}}</ref> which conceptually integrates justice into a larger peace theory.\n\n==Organizations and prizes==\n\n=== United Nations ===\n[[File:United Nations peacekeeping missions 2009.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[List of UN peacekeeping missions|UN peacekeeping missions]].

The UN was founded in 1945 after World War II to replace the League of Nations, to stop wars between countries, and to provide a platform for dialogue.\n\nThe UN, after approval by the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], sends [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states of the UN. The forces, also called the \"Blue Helmets\", who enforce UN accords are awarded [[United Nations Medal]]s, which are considered [[international decoration]]s instead of [[military decoration]]s. The peacekeeping force as a whole received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1988.\n\n===Domestic peace===\n\t\n{{Main|Police}}\n\t\nThe obligation of the state to provide for domestic peace within its borders in usually charged to the [[police]] and other general domestic policing activities.

These dimensions correlate closely with [[elements of national power]].\n\n===League of Nations===\nThe principal forerunner of the United Nations was the [[League of Nations]]. It was created at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], and emerged from the advocacy of [[Woodrow Wilson]] and other idealists during World War I. The Covenant of the League of Nations was included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, and the League was based in [[Geneva]] until its dissolution as a result of World War II and replacement by the United Nations. The high hopes widely held for the League in the 1920s, for example amongst members of the [[League of Nations Union]], gave way to widespread disillusion in the 1930s as the League struggled to respond to challenges from Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Japan. \n\nOne of the most important scholars of the League of Nations was Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]]. Like many of the other British enthusiasts for the League, such as [[Gilbert Murray]] and [[Florence Stawell]] \u2013 the so-called \"Greece and peace\" set \u2013 he came to this from the study of the [[classics]].\n\nThe creation of the League of Nations, and the hope for informed public opinion on international issues (expressed for example by the [[Union for Democratic Control]] during World War I), also saw the creation after World War I of bodies dedicated to understanding international affairs, such as the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York and the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] at [[Chatham House]] in London. At the same time, the academic study of international relations started to professionalize, with the creation of the first professorship of international politics, named for Woodrow Wilson, at [[Aberystwyth]], Wales, in 1919.\n\n===Olympic Games===\nThe late 19th century idealist advocacy of peace which led to the creation of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], and ultimately the [[League of Nations]], also saw the re-emergence of the ancient Olympic ideal.

Pacifism covers a spectrum of views ranging from the belief that international disputes can and should all be resolved via peaceful behaviors; to calls for the abolition of various organizations which tend to institutionalize aggressive behaviors, such as the military, or arms manufacturers; to opposition to any organization of society that might rely in any way upon governmental force.  Such groups which sometimes oppose the governmental use of force include [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarchists]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]].  Absolute pacifism opposes violent behavior under all circumstance, including defense of self and others.\n\nPacifism may be based on [[morality|moral]] principles (a [[deontological]] view) or [[pragmatism]] (a [[consequentialist]] view). Principled pacifism holds that all forms of violent behavior are inappropriate responses to conflict, and are morally wrong.  Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and inter-personal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found.\n\n===Inner peace, meditation and prayerfulness===\n[[File:Abbot of Watkungtaphao in Phu Soidao Waterfall.jpg|thumb|upright|Buddhist monk during meditation near Phu Soidao Nationalpark.]]\n{{main|Inner peace}}\nPsychological or inner peace (i.e. peace of mind) refers to a state of being internally or spiritually at peace, with sufficient [[knowledge]] and understanding to keep oneself calm in the face of apparent discord or stress. Being internally \"at peace\" is considered by many to be a healthy mental state, or [[homeostasis]] and to be the opposite of feeling stressful, mentally anxious, or emotionally unstable. Within the meditative traditions, the psychological or inward achievement of \"peace of mind\" is often associated with bliss and happiness.\n\nPeace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some meditative traditions, inner peace is believed to be a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various types of meditation, prayer, t'ai chi ch'uan ([[T'ai chi ch'uan|\u592a\u6781\u62f3, t\u00e0ij\u00edqu\u00e1n]]), yoga, or other various types of mental or physical disciplines. Many such practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself. An emphasis on finding one's inner peace is often associated with traditions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and some traditional Christian contemplative practices such as [[monasticism]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rKkJs-KHCakC&printsec=frontcover&dq=essential+writings+of+christian+mysticism&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjju8O3gOTWAhUm0IMKHZa0DnMQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=Sighed%20for%20ecstatic%20peace&f=false Essential Writings of Christian Mysticism] Page 163. 2006.

He deployed satyagraha techniques in campaigns for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] and also during his earlier struggles in [[South Africa]].\n\nThe word ''satyagraha'' itself was coined through a public contest that Gandhi sponsored through the newspaper he published in South Africa, 'Indian Opinion', when he realized that neither the common, contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict. According to Gandhi's autobiography, the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi (presumably no relation), who submitted the entry 'sadagraha', which Gandhi then modified to 'satyagraha'. Etymologically, this Hindic word means 'truth-firmness', and is commonly translated as 'steadfastness in the truth' or 'truth-force'.\n\nSatyagraha theory also influenced [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] during the campaigns he led during the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States. The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: \"They say, 'means are, after all, means'. I would say, 'means are, after all, everything'. As the means so the end...\"<ref>R.K. Prabhu & U.R.

Exponents of this view have included [[Metternich]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], and [[Henry Kissinger]]. A related approach \u2013 more in the tradition of [[Hugo Grotius]] than [[Thomas Hobbes]] \u2013 was articulated by the so-called \"[[English school of international relations theory]]\" such as [[Martin Wight]] in his book ''Power Politics'' (1946, 1978) and [[Hedley Bull]] in ''The Anarchical Society'' (1977).\n\nAs the maintenance of a balance of power could in some circumstances require a willingness to go to war, some critics saw the idea of a balance of power as promoting war rather than promoting peace. This was a radical critique of those supporters of the Allied and Associated Powers who justified entry into World War I on the grounds that it was necessary to preserve the balance of power in Europe from a German bid for [[hegemony]].\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, and especially during the [[cold war]], a particular form of balance of power \u2013 mutual nuclear deterrence \u2013 emerged as a widely held doctrine on the key to peace between the great powers. Critics argued that the development of nuclear stockpiles increased the chances of war rather than peace, and that the \"nuclear umbrella\" made it \"safe\" for smaller wars (e.g. the [[Vietnam war]] and the Soviet invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] to end the [[Prague Spring]]), so making such wars more likely.\n\n===Free trade, interdependence and globalization===\n{{main|Doux commerce|Peace economics}}\nIt was a central tenet of [[classical liberalism]], for example among English liberal thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century, that free trade promoted peace. For example, the Cambridge economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883\u20131946) said that he was \"brought up\" on this idea and held it unquestioned until at least the 1920s.<ref>Quoted from [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 2.</ref> During the [[economic globalization]] in the decades leading up to World War I, writers such as [[Norman Angell]] argued that the growth of economic interdependence between the great powers made war between them futile and therefore unlikely. He made this argument in 1913. A year later Europe's economically interconnected states were embroiled in what would later become known as the First World War.<ref>https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2019/01/14/the-end-of-the-great-illusion-norman-angell-and-the-founding-of-nato/index.html</ref>\n\nThese ideas have again come to prominence among liberal internationalists during the globalization of the late 20th and early 21st century.<ref>For sources, see articles on [[liberalism]] and [[classical liberalism]].</ref> These ideas have seen [[capitalism]] as consistent with, even conducive to, peace.\n\n=== Game theory ===\n{{Main|Peace war game}}\n\nThe ''Peace & War Game'' is an approach in [[game theory]] to understand the relationship between peace and conflicts.\n\nThe [[iterated game]] hypotheses was originally used by academic groups and [[computer simulation]]s to study possible strategies of [[cooperation]] and [[aggression]].<ref>Shy, O., 1996, ''[[industrial organization|Industrial Organization]]: Theory and Applications'', Cambridge, Mass.: The [[MIT]] Press.</ref>\n\nAs peace makers became richer over time, it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated. One of the well studied [[strategy|strategies]] that acquired wealth more rapidly was based on [[Genghis Khan]], i.e. a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources. This led, in contrast, to the development of what's known as the \"provokable nice guy [[strategy]]\", a peace-maker until attacked, improved upon merely to win by occasional forgiveness even when attacked. By adding the results of all pairwise games for each player, one sees that multiple players gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding a constantly aggressive player.<ref name=Miller>N.R. Miller, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4235437 \"Nice Strategies Finish First: A Review of ''The Evolution of Cooperation''\"], ''[[Politics and the Life Sciences]]'', [[Association for Politics and the Life Sciences]], 1985.</ref>\n\n===Socialism and managed capitalism===\nSocialist, communist, and left-wing liberal writers of the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g., [[Lenin]], [[J.A. Hobson]], [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]) argued that capitalism caused war (e.g. through promoting imperial or other economic rivalries that lead to international conflict). This led some to argue that international socialism was the key to peace.\n\nHowever, in response to such writers in the 1930s who argued that capitalism caused war, the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883\u20131946) argued that managed capitalism could promote peace. This involved international coordination of fiscal/monetary policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against each other, and a high degree of freedom of trade. These ideas underlay Keynes's work during World War II that led to the creation of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] at [[Breton Woods, New Jersey|Bretton Woods]] in 1944, and later of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (subsequently the [[World Trade Organization]]).<ref>. See [[Donald Markwell]]. ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Theory of 'active peace'===\nBorrowing from the teachings of Norwegian theorist [[Johan Galtung]], one of the pioneers of the field of [[Peace and conflict studies|Peace Research]], on 'Positive Peace',<ref>Galtung, J: ''Peace by peaceful means: peace and conflict, development and civilization'', page 32. Sage Publications, 1996.</ref> and on the writings of Maine Quaker [[Gray Cox]], a consortium of theorists, activists, and practitioners in the experimental [[John Woolman College]] initiative have arrived at a theory of \"active peace\". This theory posits in part that peace is part of a triad, which also includes justice and wholeness (or well-being), an interpretation consonant with scriptural scholarly interpretations of the meaning of the early Hebrew word ''shalom''.  Furthermore, the consortium have integrated Galtung's teaching of the meanings of the terms peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding, to also fit into a triadic and interdependent formulation or structure. Vermont Quaker John V. Wilmerding posits five stages of growth applicable to individuals, communities, and societies, whereby one transcends first the 'surface' awareness that most people have of these kinds of issues, emerging successively into acquiescence, pacifism, passive resistance, active resistance, and finally into ''active peace'', dedicating themselves to peacemaking, peacekeeping or peace building.<ref>{{cite web | last = Wilmerding | first = John | title = The Theory of Active Peace | url = http://internationalpeaceandconflict.ning.com/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace | accessdate = 7 February 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090620023950/http://internationalpeaceandconflict.ning.com/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace | archivedate = 20 June 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===International organization and law===\nOne of the most influential theories of peace, especially since [[Woodrow Wilson]] led the creation of the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, is that peace will be advanced if the intentional anarchy of states is replaced through the growth of [[international law]] promoted and enforced through international organizations such as the League of Nations, the [[United Nations]], and other functional international organizations. One of the most important early exponents of this view was Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]], for example in his 1936 book ''The League of Nations and the Rule of Law''.<ref>Macmillan, 1936.</ref>\n\n===Trans-national solidarity===\nMany \"idealist\" thinkers about international relations \u2013 e.g. in the traditions of [[Kant]] and [[Karl Marx]] \u2013 have argued that the key to peace is the growth of some form of [[solidarity]] between peoples (or classes of people) spanning the lines of cleavage between nations or states that lead to war.<ref>See, e.g., Sir [[Harry Hinsley]]. ''Power and the Pursuit of Peace'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962.</ref>\n\nOne version of this is the idea of promoting international understanding between nations through the international mobility of students \u2013 an idea most powerfully advanced by [[Cecil Rhodes]] in the creation of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], and his successors such as [[J. William Fulbright]].<ref>Discussed above. See, e.g., [[Donald Markwell]]. ''\"Instincts to Lead\": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'' (2013).</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that peace can be developed among countries on the basis of active management of water resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strategicforesight.com/publications.php#.WBm94-V94dU|title=Publications \u2013 Strategic Foresight Group, Think Tank, Global Policy, Global affairs research, Water Conflict studies, global policy strategies, strategic policy group, global future studies|website=strategicforesight.com|access-date=2 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101013118/http://strategicforesight.com/publications.php#.WBm94-V94dU#.WBm94-V94dU|archive-date=1 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Lyotard post-modernism===\nFollowing [[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]], Wolfgang S\u00fctzl<ref>[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]/Wolfgang S\u00fctzl: A Call for Many Peaces; in: Dietrich, Wolfgang, Josefina Echavarr\u00eda Alvarez, Norbert Koppensteiner eds.: Key Texts of Peace Studies; LIT M\u00fcnster, Vienna, 2006</ref> and the [[Innsbruck School of Peace Studies]], some peace thinkers have abandoned any single and all-encompassing definition of peace. Rather, they promote the idea of ''many peaces''. They argue that since no singular, correct definition of peace can exist, peace should be perceived as a plurality. This post-modern understanding of peace(s) was based on the philosophy of [[Jean Francois Lyotard]]. It served as a fundament for the more recent concept of trans-rational peace(s) and elicitive conflict transformation.\n\nIn 2008 Dietrich enlarged his approach of the ''many peaces'' to the so-called ''five families'' of peace interpretations: the energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational approach.<ref>[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]: Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture; Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2012</ref> Trans-rationality unites the rational and mechanistic understanding of modern peace in a relational and culture-based manner with spiritual narratives and energetic interpretations.<ref>[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]], Josefina Echavarr\u00eda Alvarez, Gustavo Esteva, Daniela Ingruber, Norbert Koppensteiner eds.: The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies.
