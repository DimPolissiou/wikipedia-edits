When Bosch corners the suspect, the suspect reached in his pocket and Bosch shot him dead. According to him, the suspect reached for a gun. Although cleared by the department, the family of the suspect sues Bosch in a wrongful death suit. Wanting to keep busy during the trial, Bosch gives two fellow detectives Lakers tickets to take the weekend shift. He takes a case when a doctor's ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) dog finds a child's bone. The finding of the bone leads to more bones and it was determined that it was a horribly-abused boy who died in 1989. During the investigation, Bosch meets rookie police officer Julia Brasher ([[Annie Wersching]]) and forms a connection with her. While in the morgue investigating the bones, the coroner details the abuse of the child and Bosch gets flashbacks of when he was abused as a child.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Chapter Two: Lost Light\n |DirectedBy = [[Kevin Dowling (director)|Kevin Dowling]]\n |WrittenBy = Tom Smuts & Eric Overmyer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = A patrol unit pulls over a van after finding the plates belong to another vehicle and officers discover a man's naked body in the back.  Meanwhile, Detectives Bosch and Edgar continue the investigation of the dead child by re-interviewing  neighborhood man Nicholas Trent ([[Rob Brownstein]]) who neglected to mention a previous conviction for pedophilia. Some children's items are found in a bin in Trent's home, which he explains away as part of his job as a set designer for movies.  After attaining Trent's consent to take a polygraph, the detectives leave but are accosted by a reporter who has been following Bosch. The reporter uses the threat of printing speculation to wrest a comment from Bosch. Bosch supplies, and records, a comment that a routine canvass of the neighborhood has been conducted, during which everyone interviewed has been cooperative, and no suspect has yet been identified. At his civil trial, Bosch is ambushed by accusations that he murdered his suspect because his own mother was a prostitute. Brasher spends the night with Bosch and over breakfast the next morning shows Bosch an online news article identifying Trent as a pedophile and naming him as a suspect in the child murder. Back at the county jail, the driver of the van, identified as Raynard Waits ([[Jason Gedrick]]), seeks a deal to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty and revealing the locations of all the victims, including the child in Bosch's case.  Lieutenant Billets ([[Amy Aquino]]) tells Deputy Chief Irving ([[Lance Reddick]]) that Bosch believes his confidential personnel file was leaked to the attorney in the case against him by a Captain with a grudge against Bosch. Bosch receives a call from Trent's attorney, who thinks Trent is in police custody. After assuring the attorney that Trent is not in custody, Bosch and Edgar return to Trent's home and find that Trent has committed suicide by hanging.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Chapter Three: Blue Religion\n |DirectedBy = Kevin Dowling\n |WrittenBy = [[Diane Frolov]] & [[Andrew Schneider]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = After viewing the scene Bosch and the journalist following him exchange words outside of Trent's house, with both accusing the other of being the reason for Trent's death. Bosch later goes to Brasher's apartment and attempts to warn her that her own maverick ways will get her fired, which leads to an argument where Bosch is told to leave. Deputy Chief Irving tries to get Bosch and Edgar to declare Trent murdered the boy in the hill but Bosch remains unconvinced, which further angers Captain Pounds. A tip from Sheila Delacroix, a woman with a missing brother, finally leads Bosch and Edgar to conclude the body is Arthur Delacroix, a runaway from a troubled home. District Attorney and political climber Rick O'Shea ([[Steven Culp]]) informs Bosch that Waits has confessed to Delacroix's murder and orders Bosch to confirm the story. Over drinks with DC Irving, Bosch is informed this may be a purely political maneuver by the DA in a run for mayor. Bosch apologizes to Brasher and they sleep together again. At the county jail, Waits reveals specific details of contents from Delacroix's backpack that only the police knew. Bosch, still unconvinced of Waits' guilt, is forced to wonder how Waits could have known.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = Chapter Four: Fugazi\n |DirectedBy = [[Ernest Dickerson]]\n |WrittenBy = [[George Pelecanos]] & Michael Connelly\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Sergeant \"Mank\" Mankiewicz  ([[Scott Klace]]) tells Bosch that the officer who pulled over Waits, George Irving (who is also Deputy Chief Irving's son), may have done so illegally and George's partner Pierce wants to file a formal complaint. Bosch quietly talks to Pierce and convinces him that Waits is too much of a bad man to let him walk and promises to make sure Pierce gets a more by-the-book partner. Bosch and Edgar visit Delacroix's estranged mother ([[Mary Page Keller]]) and get definite confirmation the body is Arthur Delacroix. Bosch's trial is concluded and the jury finds for the plaintiff; however, the jury only fines Bosch one dollar. While the LAPD and his lawyer are pleased, Bosch is angered by the jury's decision. DC Irving orders Bosch to oversee a field trip where Waits will show the police and the DA where he killed his victims. O'Shea brings a camera crew to show off his leadership abilities. During the trip Waits taunts Bosch in the car and later purposely falls breaking his nose causing O'Shea to demand Waits be un-cuffed over Bosch's strenuous objections. Waits uses the opportunity to escape by stealing Detective Moore's gun and shooting Moore and a Deputy DA who O'Shea uses as a shield. O'Shea confiscates the video from the cameraman and provides DC Irving with a copy. Bosch swears to an injured Moore that he'll get Waits.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Chapter Five: Mama's Boy\n |DirectedBy = Ernest Dickerson\n |WrittenBy = William N.

Waits enters the house of an elderly woman (who turns out to be his mother) who calls him David. Waits asks his mother, who is unaware of his crimes, if he can spend Christmas with her and she happily agrees. Bosch and Edgar interview Delacroix's father Sam ([[Pat Skipper]]), during which a drunken Sam breaks down and declares that he killed his own son, but seems stunned by the abuse allegations. In a later interview Bosch becomes unconvinced of Sam's guilt. Bosch searches Sam's house and finds evidence Sam molested his daughter Sheila. At the end of the episode Waits picks up another male prostitute and murders him. \n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n |Title = Chapter Six: Donkey's Years\n |DirectedBy = [[Roxann Dawson]]\n |WrittenBy = Jennifer Ames & Steve Turner\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Waits calls Bosch to ask about his options and tells Bosch they are similar. Bosch informs Waits he can rot in a cell, kill himself, or let the police kill him. Bosch tells Sam Delacroix it was impossible for him to kill Arthur because as a drunk he was physically unable to bury the body where it was found. Bosch reveals he knows Sam raped Sheila and Sheila must have taken out her pain on Arthur. Since Bosch can't arrest Sam he uses this to demand Sam to identify any of Arthur's old friends so he can get new leads. Brasher helps Bosch find a present for his teenage daughter until he receives another call from Waits. Waits taunts Bosch leading Bosch to another murder scene at a hardware store. Bosch heads to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife Eleanor Wish ([[Sarah Clarke]]) and his daughter Maddie ([[Madison Lintz]]) for Christmas, but also wants Eleanor's skills as a former FBI profiler to get her opinion on Waits. While initially unwilling to help, Eleanor reviews the Waits case and concludes the name Raynard Waits comes from a French fairy tale and the items stolen from the hardware store were for a lair. Irving informs DA O'Shea he has the video of the Waits field trip and makes a tentative alliance to assure O'Shea becomes mayor and Irving becomes Chief. While in Las Vegas, Bosch is informed of a potential lead in the Delacroix case involving Johnny Stokes ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), and Bosch immediately returns to Los Angeles. While pursuing Stokes, Officer Brasher is shot in the ribs (although protected by her bullet-resistant vest) and she claims Stokes did it in a struggle. Bosch is certain he saw Brasher accidentally shoot herself, which if true would be the final mark on her record to fire her.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = Chapter Seven: Lost Boys\n |DirectedBy = [[Alex Zakrzewski]]\n |WrittenBy = Joe Gonzalez & Eric Overmyer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Bosch interviews Stokes about Delacroix, but only comes away more convinced that Stokes didn't shoot Brasher. Visiting Lieutenant Billets at her home for advice on Brasher's shooting leaves Bosch convinced he has to tell the truth no matter the consequences. Bosch revisits Brasher to tell her he knows the truth about the shooting, and Brasher calls Bosch a hypocrite. Bosch has Stokes released to spare the LAPD potential embarrassment. Waits attempts to pick up a man on the highway only to fail to kill him, which leads DC Irving to assign Bosch to find Waits independent of Captain Pounds' task force. Bosch searches Waits' last known address and finds evidence of Waits' obsession with old Parisian catacombs and skulls, which leads Eleanor to speculate that Waits may be building an underground monument of his own. After Edgar reviews footage of a conversation with Waits, Bosch realizes he and Waits were both in the same orphanage giving Bosch his first lead on Waits' real identity. Waits murders his sick mother, telling her that he loves her.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 8\n |Title = Chapter Eight: High Low\n |DirectedBy = [[Matt Earl Beesley]]\n |WrittenBy = William N.

Captain Pounds informs Brasher her statement about Stokes is a lie and implies he'll back her if she reports Bosch for sexual harassment. DC Irving approaches a powerful voice in the African-American community, Reverend Ott ([[Peter Macon]]), about backing Rick O'Shea for mayor in return for Irving becoming Chief and Ott given a seat on the police commission. A county coroner admits to Bosch that Waits called him from jail and tricked him into giving up information about what was in Delacroix's backpack, which eventually led to Waits' escape. Brasher is reassigned to Bosch's precinct to both of their disappointment. A new lead in the Delacroix case suggests Trent really did kill the boy but on further review convinces Bosch that Stokes actually killed Delacroix for his skateboard. A murder of a prostitute is very similar to his own mother's murder, which draws Bosch back into the Waits case. Waits calls Bosch to continue to taunt him. \n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = Chapter Nine: The Magic Castle\n |DirectedBy = Alex Zakrzewski\n |WrittenBy = Diane Frolov & Andrew Schneider\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Edgar informs an angry rank and file that Stokes is wanted for Delacroix's murder, which forces both Mank and Edgar to defend Bosch. Bosch and Billets meet for a drink where Billets admits she also is in a compromising relationship with someone under her command. Waits calls Bosch again to tell him it's all coming to an end. Bosch replies that he knows all of the secrets Waits tried to taunt him with. Waits kidnaps a young mother, leaving a note in her child's stroller in order to taunt Bosch. Bosch calls Eleanor for help, and she tells Bosch the mother is bait for him. Using the files from the orphanage Bosch and Edgar track down Waits to a shed. While Edgar calls for backup, Bosch finds a secret tunnel where Waits has his hostage. After a heated exchange of words Waits throws his hostage aside and aims a gun at Bosch, which forces Bosch to kill him. In the aftermath, Captain Pounds orders his subordinates to tell the media Pounds' task force found Waits. Bosch calls Eleanor to tell her what happened and to ask about Maddie. DC Irving informs Bosch that Waits' gun was unloaded to which Bosch simply replies, \u201cSuicide by cop.\u201d\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 10\n |Title = Chapter Ten: Us and Them\n |DirectedBy = [[Thomas Carter (director)|Thomas Carter]]\n |WrittenBy = Michael Connelly & T.L.

Arthur Delacroix's remains are buried leading Sheila to express her anger that Bosch knows what happened to her. DA O'Shea opens a grand jury hearing against the LAPD to ensure Irving's blackmail video of the Waits escape is neutralized. Eleanor calls Bosch to tell him Maddie has run away to LA. Bosch finds Maddie at the bus station and chastises her but is also happy for a chance to spend time with her. Edgar continues to look into Stokes and finds him working as muscle for a slumlord. Leaving Maddie with a colleague, Bosch joins Edgar to chase Stokes. After being caught, Stokes claims Delacroix's death was an accident despite the coroner's report. Bosch returns to Maddie and when she asks, he explains his past to her and she begins to understand him. Stokes is released since he was a juvenile when he killed Delacroix. Captain Pounds approaches Bosch to shame him for not jailing Stokes, but Bosch warns Pounds to leave him alone. Pounds grabs Bosch's arm and Bosch shoves Pounds through a window in front of Mank. Pounds screams that Bosch will regret that incident but Bosch walks away, happy enough that he'll now spend time with his daughter. Bosch turns in his gun and badge to Billets and goes home, only to be called later by Edgar. Sam Delacroix has murdered Stokes. Bosch approaches Sam and asks him if he felt absolved for all he had done but Billets stops Bosch from possible issues in the future.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\n{{Episode table |background=#221F54 |overall=5 |season=5 |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |released=y|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 11\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Trunk Music\n |DirectedBy = [[Alex Zakrzewski]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Eric Overmyer]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|3|11}}\n |ShortSummary = Bosch has been suspended for six months following his incident with Captain Pounds. During that time Bosch was able to grow closer to his daughter Maddie but is largely unchanged.  O'Shea, Irving, and Reverend Ott continue to plan O'Shea's run for mayor and O'Shea's grand jury continues to work under the assumption that Bosch is to blame for the Raynard Waits fiasco. Billets assigns Bosch to a case of a dead body in a car trunk. The body is identified as Anthony Allen ([[Ludwig Manukian]]), a pornographer recently returned from Las Vegas. Chief Irving lies to his wife Connie ([[Erika Alexander]]) about their son, George Irving ([[Robbie Jones (actor)|Robbie Jones]]), telling her George is working a desk job when he is actually working undercover for Internal Affairs investigating Narcotics Detective Eddie Arceneaux ([[James Ransone]]). Bosch and Edgar go to inform Veronica Allen ([[Jeri Ryan]]) and find Carl Nash ([[Brent Sexton]]), a former LAPD detective who resigned after an IA investigation, is running security at the Allen's gated community. Veronica informs Bosch and Edgar that Tony had a string of girlfriends but has no clue why Tony was dead. Billets' search of Tony's car reveals a secret compartment with over two hundred thousand dollars in cash. Bosch and Edgar search Tony's office and find a hidden camera.

Attempts to get information about Allen's death are blocked by Special Agent Griffin ([[John Marshall Jones]]) who only tells them Allen was a minor player in a \"National Security\" case. George Irving continues working with Arceneaux who is careful to not show any of his shakedowns on camera. Bosch receives a call from a reporter who tells him a woman has contacted her about the murder of Bosch's mother. Bosch dismisses the claims as someone just wanting attention. Edgar finds paperwork showing Tony Allen changed his name and was previously a member of an Armenian street gang which has evolved into a criminal empire. Bosch and Billets meet for a drink where Billets reveals her own relationship has ended. Mayor Ramos ([[Yancey Arias]]) meets with Irving to warn him that the Mayor's office knows what Irving, O'Shea, and Ott are planning and asks Irving to support Ramos instead. Irving tells Ramos that he'll pray on it. Edgar deduces Allen was a money launderer for his former Armenian gang. Bosch approaches Veronica Allen who says she suspected the money laundering but since she didn't speak Armenian she didn't know anything else. Bosch asks Edgar to find anyone who can tell them anything about Veronica's character. \n |LineColor = 221F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 13\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Victim of the Night\n |DirectedBy = [[Pieter Jan Brugge]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Diane Frolov]] & [[Andrew Schneider]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|3|11}}\n |ShortSummary = Bosch heads to Las Vegas to track Tony Allen's movements the days before he died. Deputy Chief Irving advises his son George that having fear about his assignment would not be a bad thing. In a later meeting with his handler, George states doubts that Arceneaux is part of a larger group but his handler disagrees. Edgar finds people who knew Veronica and they all say she's manipulative. Bosch is partnered in Las Vegas with Detective Iverson who tells him Allen could have been working for Joey Marks ([[Tom Mardirosian]]), an Armenian gangster that the LVPD wants to take down. Bosch takes time to see Maddie who informs him that Eleanor's current husband may have left her and Eleanor is starting to become unhinged. That night Bosch goes to Allen's favorite strip club in an attempt to locate Layla, Allen's current girlfriend, but draws the attention of the club's manager Luke Rykov ([[Matthew Lillard]]). Rykov denies he works for Marks, knows Layla, or knows anything about Allen's death but after he has Bosch thrown out he calls someone and speaks in Armenian. Bosch visit's Eleanor's house and also starts becoming concerned for his ex-wife's well being. He becomes even more concerned when a casino security video shows Eleanor playing poker with Tony Allen days before his death. The next day O'Shea announces his candidacy for mayor with Ott and Irving's endorsement. Angered by the announcement, Ramos and his campaign manager Jen Kowski plan to send a message. Bosch confronts Eleanor about the security video leading to a heated argument and Eleanor ordering him out of her house. \n |LineColor = 221F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 14\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = Who's Lucky Now?\n |DirectedBy = [[Christine Moore (director)|Christine Moore]]\n |WrittenBy = Tom Smuts\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|3|11}}\n |ShortSummary = Detective Iverson calls Bosch to tell him Rykov's prints were on Allen's body and they have a search warrant.

O'Grady encourages George to get closer to his father to leak information to her. The LVPD reveals Eleanor has minor ties to Marks and uses this to force Bosch to agree to a joint investigation. Eleanor admits that she borrowed money from a loan shark to pay off gambling debts once but long ago paid off her debt. Edgar meets with a detective in the gang unit who tells him Marks and Allen are actually cousins and Marks has dealings with several terrorist organizations. Bosch and Iverson attempt to interrogate Rykov who angrily accuses them of planting the gun. The next day Marks and his attorney, Martin Weiss ([[Christopher Cousins]]), approach Bosch with proof Rykov was in Las Vegas when Allen was murdered and to offer a bribe to exchange the gun found in Rykov's house. Bosch refuses and Marks threatens him. Bosch goes to Eleanor to attempt to mend fences but ends up in another fight. DC Irving informs Lt. Billets that the Mayor is using current Chief Tensor to harass O'Shea donors and asks Billets to be a supporter of Irving becoming Chief. Bosch returns to Los Angeles to find Agent Griffin giving Billets proof that Rykov was in Los Angeles when Tony Allen was murdered. Bosch and Edgar go to inform Veronica Allen of Rykov's arrest and run into Carl Nash who implies he knew Allen had to be a mobster.

While Edgar wants to report the kidnapping to the local police he defers to Bosch who was warned to not involve the police.

Rykov identifies the kidnappers and gives Bosch a location. Bosch and Edgar take down the kidnappers and rescue Eleanor and Maddie. Eleanor begs Bosch to not make an official report because she doesn't want Maddie in the middle of a mob trial. Bosch agrees on the condition they stay with him in Los Angeles until the case is over. In court Rykov doesn't challenge the extradition and Bosch tells Marks' attorney Martin Weiss that he'll cripple Marks if Marks ever goes after his family again. George joins Arceneaux and O'Grady's crew in ripping off a drug stash house. Afterwards he's introduced to their boss, Nash.

When Bosch corners the suspect, the suspect reached in his pocket and Bosch shot him dead. According to him, the suspect reached for a gun. Although cleared by the department, the family of the suspect sues Bosch in a wrongful death suit. Wanting to keep busy during the trial, Bosch gives two fellow detectives Lakers tickets to take the weekend shift. He takes a case when a doctor's ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) dog finds a child's bone. The finding of the bone leads to more bones and it was determined that it was a horribly-abused boy who died in 1989. During the investigation, Bosch meets rookie police officer Julia Brasher ([[Annie Wersching]]) and forms a connection with her. While in the morgue investigating the bones, the coroner details the abuse of the child and Bosch gets flashbacks of when he was abused as a child.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Chapter Two: Lost Light\n |DirectedBy = [[Kevin Dowling (director)|Kevin Dowling]]\n |WrittenBy = Tom Smuts & Eric Overmyer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = A patrol unit pulls over a van after finding the plates belong to another vehicle and officers discover a man's naked body in the back.  Meanwhile, Detectives Bosch and Edgar continue the investigation of the dead child by re-interviewing  neighborhood man Nicholas Trent ([[Rob Brownstein]]) who neglected to mention a previous conviction for pedophilia. Some children's items are found in a bin in Trent's home, which he explains away as part of his job as a set designer for movies.  After attaining Trent's consent to take a polygraph, the detectives leave but are accosted by a reporter who has been following Bosch. The reporter uses the threat of printing speculation to wrest a comment from Bosch. Bosch supplies, and records, a comment that a routine canvass of the neighborhood has been conducted, during which everyone interviewed has been cooperative, and no suspect has yet been identified. At his civil trial, Bosch is ambushed by accusations that he murdered his suspect because his own mother was a prostitute. Brasher spends the night with Bosch and over breakfast the next morning shows Bosch an online news article identifying Trent as a pedophile and naming him as a suspect in the child murder. Back at the county jail, the driver of the van, identified as Raynard Waits ([[Jason Gedrick]]), seeks a deal to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty and revealing the locations of all the victims, including the child in Bosch's case.  Lieutenant Billets ([[Amy Aquino]]) tells Deputy Chief Irving ([[Lance Reddick]]) that Bosch believes his confidential personnel file was leaked to the attorney in the case against him by a Captain with a grudge against Bosch. Bosch receives a call from Trent's attorney, who thinks Trent is in police custody. After assuring the attorney that Trent is not in custody, Bosch and Edgar return to Trent's home and find that Trent has committed suicide by hanging.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Chapter Three: Blue Religion\n |DirectedBy = Kevin Dowling\n |WrittenBy = [[Diane Frolov]] & [[Andrew Schneider]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = After viewing the scene Bosch and the journalist following him exchange words outside of Trent's house, with both accusing the other of being the reason for Trent's death. Bosch later goes to Brasher's apartment and attempts to warn her that her own maverick ways will get her fired, which leads to an argument where Bosch is told to leave. Deputy Chief Irving tries to get Bosch and Edgar to declare Trent murdered the boy in the hill but Bosch remains unconvinced, which further angers Captain Pounds. A tip from Sheila Delacroix, a woman with a missing brother, finally leads Bosch and Edgar to conclude the body is Arthur Delacroix, a runaway from a troubled home. District Attorney and political climber Rick O'Shea ([[Steven Culp]]) informs Bosch that Waits has confessed to Delacroix's murder and orders Bosch to confirm the story. Over drinks with DC Irving, Bosch is informed this may be a purely political maneuver by the DA in a run for mayor. Bosch apologizes to Brasher and they sleep together again. At the county jail, Waits reveals specific details of contents from Delacroix's backpack that only the police knew. Bosch, still unconvinced of Waits' guilt, is forced to wonder how Waits could have known.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = Chapter Four: Fugazi\n |DirectedBy = [[Ernest Dickerson]]\n |WrittenBy = [[George Pelecanos]] & Michael Connelly\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Sergeant \"Mank\" Mankiewicz  ([[Scott Klace]]) tells Bosch that the officer who pulled over Waits, George Irving (who is also Deputy Chief Irving's son), may have done so illegally and George's partner Pierce wants to file a formal complaint. Bosch quietly talks to Pierce and convinces him that Waits is too much of a bad man to let him walk and promises to make sure Pierce gets a more by-the-book partner. Bosch and Edgar visit Delacroix's estranged mother ([[Mary Page Keller]]) and get definite confirmation the body is Arthur Delacroix. Bosch's trial is concluded and the jury finds for the plaintiff; however, the jury only fines Bosch one dollar. While the LAPD and his lawyer are pleased, Bosch is angered by the jury's decision. DC Irving orders Bosch to oversee a field trip where Waits will show the police and the DA where he killed his victims. O'Shea brings a camera crew to show off his leadership abilities. During the trip Waits taunts Bosch in the car and later purposely falls breaking his nose causing O'Shea to demand Waits be un-cuffed over Bosch's strenuous objections. Waits uses the opportunity to escape by stealing Detective Moore's gun and shooting Moore and a Deputy DA who O'Shea uses as a shield. O'Shea confiscates the video from the cameraman and provides DC Irving with a copy. Bosch swears to an injured Moore that he'll get Waits.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Chapter Five: Mama's Boy\n |DirectedBy = Ernest Dickerson\n |WrittenBy = William N.

Waits enters the house of an elderly woman (who turns out to be his mother) who calls him David. Waits asks his mother, who is unaware of his crimes, if he can spend Christmas with her and she happily agrees. Bosch and Edgar interview Delacroix's father Sam ([[Pat Skipper]]), during which a drunken Sam breaks down and declares that he killed his own son, but seems stunned by the abuse allegations. In a later interview Bosch becomes unconvinced of Sam's guilt. Bosch searches Sam's house and finds evidence Sam molested his daughter Sheila. At the end of the episode Waits picks up another male prostitute and murders him. \n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n |Title = Chapter Six: Donkey's Years\n |DirectedBy = [[Roxann Dawson]]\n |WrittenBy = Jennifer Ames & Steve Turner\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Waits calls Bosch to ask about his options and tells Bosch they are similar. Bosch informs Waits he can rot in a cell, kill himself, or let the police kill him. Bosch tells Sam Delacroix it was impossible for him to kill Arthur because as a drunk he was physically unable to bury the body where it was found. Bosch reveals he knows Sam raped Sheila and Sheila must have taken out her pain on Arthur. Since Bosch can't arrest Sam he uses this to demand Sam to identify any of Arthur's old friends so he can get new leads. Brasher helps Bosch find a present for his teenage daughter until he receives another call from Waits. Waits taunts Bosch leading Bosch to another murder scene at a hardware store. Bosch heads to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife Eleanor Wish ([[Sarah Clarke]]) and his daughter Maddie ([[Madison Lintz]]) for Christmas, but also wants Eleanor's skills as a former FBI profiler to get her opinion on Waits. While initially unwilling to help, Eleanor reviews the Waits case and concludes the name Raynard Waits comes from a French fairy tale and the items stolen from the hardware store were for a lair. Irving informs DA O'Shea he has the video of the Waits field trip and makes a tentative alliance to assure O'Shea becomes mayor and Irving becomes Chief. While in Las Vegas, Bosch is informed of a potential lead in the Delacroix case involving Johnny Stokes ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), and Bosch immediately returns to Los Angeles. While pursuing Stokes, Officer Brasher is shot in the ribs (although protected by her bullet-resistant vest) and she claims Stokes did it in a struggle. Bosch is certain he saw Brasher accidentally shoot herself, which if true would be the final mark on her record to fire her.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = Chapter Seven: Lost Boys\n |DirectedBy = [[Alex Zakrzewski]]\n |WrittenBy = Joe Gonzalez & Eric Overmyer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Bosch interviews Stokes about Delacroix, but only comes away more convinced that Stokes didn't shoot Brasher. Visiting Lieutenant Billets at her home for advice on Brasher's shooting leaves Bosch convinced he has to tell the truth no matter the consequences. Bosch revisits Brasher to tell her he knows the truth about the shooting, and Brasher calls Bosch a hypocrite. Bosch has Stokes released to spare the LAPD potential embarrassment. Waits attempts to pick up a man on the highway only to fail to kill him, which leads DC Irving to assign Bosch to find Waits independent of Captain Pounds' task force. Bosch searches Waits' last known address and finds evidence of Waits' obsession with old Parisian catacombs and skulls, which leads Eleanor to speculate that Waits may be building an underground monument of his own. After Edgar reviews footage of a conversation with Waits, Bosch realizes he and Waits were both in the same orphanage giving Bosch his first lead on Waits' real identity. Waits murders his sick mother, telling her that he loves her.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 8\n |Title = Chapter Eight: High Low\n |DirectedBy = [[Matt Earl Beesley]]\n |WrittenBy = William N.

Captain Pounds informs Brasher her statement about Stokes is a lie and implies he'll back her if she reports Bosch for sexual harassment. DC Irving approaches a powerful voice in the African-American community, Reverend Ott ([[Peter Macon]]), about backing Rick O'Shea for mayor in return for Irving becoming Chief and Ott given a seat on the police commission. A county coroner admits to Bosch that Waits called him from jail and tricked him into giving up information about what was in Delacroix's backpack, which eventually led to Waits' escape. Brasher is reassigned to Bosch's precinct to both of their disappointment. A new lead in the Delacroix case suggests Trent really did kill the boy but on further review convinces Bosch that Stokes actually killed Delacroix for his skateboard. A murder of a prostitute is very similar to his own mother's murder, which draws Bosch back into the Waits case.

Bosch and Billets meet for a drink where Billets admits she also is in a compromising relationship with someone under her command. Waits calls Bosch again to tell him it's all coming to an end. Bosch replies that he knows all of the secrets Waits tried to taunt him with. Waits kidnaps a young mother, leaving a note in her child's stroller in order to taunt Bosch. Bosch calls Eleanor for help, and she tells Bosch the mother is bait for him. Using the files from the orphanage Bosch and Edgar track down Waits to a shed. While Edgar calls for backup, Bosch finds a secret tunnel where Waits has his hostage. After a heated exchange of words Waits throws his hostage aside and aims a gun at Bosch, which forces Bosch to kill him. In the aftermath, Captain Pounds orders his subordinates to tell the media Pounds' task force found Waits. Bosch calls Eleanor to tell her what happened and to ask about Maddie.

Arthur Delacroix's remains are buried leading Sheila to express her anger that Bosch knows what happened to her. DA O'Shea opens a grand jury hearing against the LAPD to ensure Irving's blackmail video of the Waits escape is neutralized. Eleanor calls Bosch to tell him Maddie has run away to LA. Bosch finds Maddie at the bus station and chastises her but is also happy for a chance to spend time with her. Edgar continues to look into Stokes and finds him working as muscle for a slumlord. Leaving Maddie with a colleague, Bosch joins Edgar to chase Stokes. After being caught, Stokes claims Delacroix's death was an accident despite the coroner's report. Bosch returns to Maddie and when she asks, he explains his past to her and she begins to understand him. Stokes is released since he was a juvenile when he killed Delacroix. Captain Pounds approaches Bosch to shame him for not jailing Stokes, but Bosch warns Pounds to leave him alone. Pounds grabs Bosch's arm and Bosch shoves Pounds through a window in front of Mank. Pounds screams that Bosch will regret that incident but Bosch walks away, happy enough that he'll now spend time with his daughter. Bosch turns in his gun and badge to Billets and goes home, only to be called later by Edgar. Sam Delacroix has murdered Stokes. Bosch approaches Sam and asks him if he felt absolved for all he had done but Billets stops Bosch from possible issues in the future.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\n{{Episode table |background=#221F54 |overall=5 |season=5 |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |released=y|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 11\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Trunk Music\n |DirectedBy = [[Alex Zakrzewski]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Eric Overmyer]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|3|11}}\n |ShortSummary = Bosch has been suspended for six months following his incident with Captain Pounds. During that time Bosch was able to grow closer to his daughter Maddie but is largely unchanged.  O'Shea, Irving, and Reverend Ott continue to plan O'Shea's run for mayor and O'Shea's grand jury continues to work under the assumption that Bosch is to blame for the Raynard Waits fiasco. Billets assigns Bosch to a case of a dead body in a car trunk. The body is identified as Anthony Allen ([[Ludwig Manukian]]), a pornographer recently returned from Las Vegas. Chief Irving lies to his wife Connie ([[Erika Alexander]]) about their son, George Irving ([[Robbie Jones (actor)|Robbie Jones]]), telling her George is working a desk job when he is actually working undercover for Internal Affairs investigating Narcotics Detective Eddie Arceneaux ([[James Ransone]]). Bosch and Edgar go to inform Veronica Allen ([[Jeri Ryan]]) and find Carl Nash ([[Brent Sexton]]), a former LAPD detective who resigned after an IA investigation, is running security at the Allen's gated community. Veronica informs Bosch and Edgar that Tony had a string of girlfriends but has no clue why Tony was dead. Billets' search of Tony's car reveals a secret compartment with over two hundred thousand dollars in cash. Bosch and Edgar search Tony's office and find a hidden camera.

Attempts to get information about Allen's death are blocked by Special Agent Griffin ([[John Marshall Jones]]) who only tells them Allen was a minor player in a \"National Security\" case. George Irving continues working with Arceneaux who is careful to not show any of his shakedowns on camera. Bosch receives a call from a reporter who tells him a woman has contacted her about the murder of Bosch's mother. Bosch dismisses the claims as someone just wanting attention. Edgar finds paperwork showing Tony Allen changed his name and was previously a member of an Armenian street gang which has evolved into a criminal empire. Bosch and Billets meet for a drink where Billets reveals her own relationship has ended. Mayor Ramos ([[Yancey Arias]]) meets with Irving to warn him that the Mayor's office knows what Irving, O'Shea, and Ott are planning and asks Irving to support Ramos instead. Irving tells Ramos that he'll pray on it. Edgar deduces Allen was a money launderer for his former Armenian gang. Bosch approaches Veronica Allen who says she suspected the money laundering but since she didn't speak Armenian she didn't know anything else.

Deputy Chief Irving advises his son George that having fear about his assignment would not be a bad thing. In a later meeting with his handler, George states doubts that Arceneaux is part of a larger group but his handler disagrees. Edgar finds people who knew Veronica and they all say she's manipulative. Bosch is partnered in Las Vegas with Detective Iverson who tells him Allen could have been working for Joey Marks ([[Tom Mardirosian]]), an Armenian gangster that the LVPD wants to take down. Bosch takes time to see Maddie who informs him that Eleanor's current husband may have left her and Eleanor is starting to become unhinged. That night Bosch goes to Allen's favorite strip club in an attempt to locate Layla, Allen's current girlfriend, but draws the attention of the club's manager Luke Rykov ([[Matthew Lillard]]). Rykov denies he works for Marks, knows Layla, or knows anything about Allen's death but after he has Bosch thrown out he calls someone and speaks in Armenian. Bosch visit's Eleanor's house and also starts becoming concerned for his ex-wife's well being.

While skeptical of her motives, Griffin agrees to uphold his end of the agreement.

She was funded by a ''[[don des vaisseaux]]'' grant by the [[Estates of Brittany]]. <ref name=Roche85 /> She was active in the European theatres of the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|Anglo-French War]] and of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], notably taking an important role in the [[Glorious First of June]]. Later, she took part in the  [[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]] and was broken up.<ref name=forrer21 />\n\n== Context ==\nThe [[Seven Years' War]] had left the [[French Navy]] severly depleted, and the Crown did not have funds to replace the ships lost during the conflict. In late 1761 [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul]] took the direction of the Navy and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named ''[[don des vaisseaux]]''.

He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> \n\nGroignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would not allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability; furthermore, he warned that the lower headspace of the gundecks in the smaller project would hinder evacuation of smoke from the guns in combat conditions.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard quickly completed the new plans and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery could be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders to reduce the cost.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company.

On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would not allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability; furthermore, he warned that the lower headspace of the gundecks in the smaller project would hinder evacuation of smoke from the guns in combat conditions.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard quickly completed the new plans and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery could be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders to reduce the cost.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided to cease procuring material directly and to delegate that task to the harbour mandated for the construction, which would be either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her parts were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow: <ref name=forrer15 /> although ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767 <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> and officially commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> work remained to be done to make her sea worthy in June 1770, and she spent the whole year of 1770 fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]] took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.

I purchased the car  and rebuilt the Routes Group engine (5 bearing crank) and reworked the head, fitted lightened overhead gear and flywheel, the resultant high reeving engine was very quick, however required big end bearings every 100 miles. The sunbeam gear box and diff. were geared too low for the useful rev range. A very light tubular steel construction with Austin front suspension and a live rear axial.

She was the daughter and the only known child of [[Cleomenes I]], King of [[Sparta]] (r. 520\u2013490 BC) during the 6th and 5th centuries BC. She was the wife of King [[Leonidas I]], Cleomenes' half-brother, who fought and died in the [[Battle of Thermopylae]]. Gorgo was also the mother of King [[Pleistarchus]], her only son with co-King Leonidas I. She is also noted as one of the few female historical figures actually named by [[Herodotus]], and was known for her political judgment and wisdom. Her birth date is uncertain, but based on Herodotus' dating, it is most likely to have been between 518 and 508 BC (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 5.51).\n\n==Family background==\nHer father, [[Cleomenes I|Cleomenes]], was the eldest-born son of the previous Agiad king, [[Anaxandridas II]].<ref name=\"LightmanLightman2008\">{{cite book|last1=Lightman|first1=Marjorie|last2=Lightman|first2=Benjamin|title=A to Z of Ancient Greek and Roman Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2esYJJUETiYC&pg=PA148|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0794-3|page=148}}</ref> He succeeded his father at his death; however, he had three paternal half-brothers, of whom the eldest, Dorieus, would cause him some trouble. The other two half-brothers were Leonidas I and Cleombrotus. All four were sons of Anaxandridas II, one of the dual kings of Sparta of the Agiad house.{{efn|Sparta had a system of dual kings, from two rival but related houses, descended allegedly from twin sons of an early king of Sparta.<ref name=\"Jona Lendering\"/>}}\n\nAccording to one version (Herodotus's ''Histories'', 5.4), Gorgo's grandfather Anaxandridas II was long married without children and was advised to remarry (i.e. take a second wife) which he did. His second wife gave birth to the future Cleomenes I who was thus his eldest son; however, his first wife also became pregnant, and eventually had three sons, including Leonidas I, Gorgo's future husband. Other versions imply that Cleomenes was either born by the king's first marriage or by a non-marital alliance. Most historians favor Herodotus because he is the earliest source. In either case, there appears to have been some tension between the eldest son and his half-brothers. This tension was only resolved by Cleomenes' death (or murder) and accession of Leonidas I (Cleomenes' half-brother and son-in-law).\n\n==Marriage and reign==\nLooking forward to Cleomenes' death, his only surviving child Gorgo became his sole heiress. She was apparently already married by 490 to her half-uncle Leonidas I.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/spartarulers/a/Gorgo.htm |title=Gorgo of Sparta |publisher=Ancienthistory.about.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2011-07-24}}</ref>King Leonidas and Queen Gorgo would have at least one child, a son, [[Pleistarchus]], co-King of Sparta from 480 BC to his death in 459 BC/458 BC.<ref name=\"Rahe1994\">{{cite book|last=Rahe|first=Paul Anthony|title=Republics Ancient and Modern|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zymp_kM33ZcC&pg=PA318|year=1994|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-4473-1|page=318}}</ref>\n\nArguably, Gorgo's most significant role occurred prior to the Persian invasion of 480 BC. According to Herodotus's ''Histories'', [[Demaratus]], then in exile at the Persian court, sent a warning to Sparta about [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]'s pending invasion. In order to prevent the message from being intercepted by the Persians or their vassal states, the message was written on a wooden tablet and then covered with wax. \"The Spartans\", presumably the ephors, Gerousia or the kings, did not know what to do with the seemingly blank wax-tablet, until Queen Gorgo advised them to clear the wax off the tablet.

Her birth date is uncertain, but based on Herodotus' dating, it is most likely to have been between 518 and 508 BC (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 5.51).\n\n==Family background==\nHer father, [[Cleomenes I|Cleomenes]], was the eldest-born son of the previous Agiad king, [[Anaxandridas II]].<ref name=\"LightmanLightman2008\">{{cite book|last1=Lightman|first1=Marjorie|last2=Lightman|first2=Benjamin|title=A to Z of Ancient Greek and Roman Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2esYJJUETiYC&pg=PA148|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0794-3|page=148}}</ref> He succeeded his father at his death; however, he had three paternal half-brothers, of whom the eldest, Dorieus, would cause him some trouble. The other two half-brothers were Leonidas I and Cleombrotus. All four were sons of Anaxandridas II, one of the dual kings of Sparta of the Agiad house.{{efn|Sparta had a system of dual kings, from two rival but related houses, descended allegedly from twin sons of an early king of Sparta.<ref name=\"Jona Lendering\"/>}}\n\nAccording to one version (Herodotus's ''Histories'', 5.4), Gorgo's grandfather Anaxandridas II was long married without children and was advised to remarry (i.e. take a second wife) which he did. His second wife gave birth to the future Cleomenes I who was thus his eldest son; however, his first wife also became pregnant, and eventually had three sons, including Leonidas I, Gorgo's future husband. Other versions imply that Cleomenes was either born by the king's first marriage or by a non-marital alliance. Most historians favor Herodotus because he is the earliest source. In either case, there appears to have been some tension between the eldest son and his half-brothers. This tension was only resolved by Cleomenes' death (or murder) and accession of Leonidas I (Cleomenes' half-brother and son-in-law).\n\n==Marriage and reign==\nLooking forward to Cleomenes' death, his only surviving child Gorgo became his sole heiress. She was apparently already married by 490 to her half-uncle Leonidas I.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/spartarulers/a/Gorgo.htm |title=Gorgo of Sparta |publisher=Ancienthistory.about.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2011-07-24}}</ref>King Leonidas and Queen Gorgo would have at least one child, a son, [[Pleistarchus]], co-King of Sparta from 480 BC to his death in 459 BC/458 BC.<ref name=\"Rahe1994\">{{cite book|last=Rahe|first=Paul Anthony|title=Republics Ancient and Modern|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zymp_kM33ZcC&pg=PA318|year=1994|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-4473-1|page=318}}</ref>\n\nArguably, Gorgo's most significant role occurred prior to the Persian invasion of 480 BC. According to Herodotus's ''Histories'', [[Demaratus]], then in exile at the Persian court, sent a warning to Sparta about [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]'s pending invasion. In order to prevent the message from being intercepted by the Persians or their vassal states, the message was written on a wooden tablet and then covered with wax. \"The Spartans\", presumably the ephors, Gerousia or the kings, did not know what to do with the seemingly blank wax-tablet, until Queen Gorgo advised them to clear the wax off the tablet. She is described by [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] in his book [[The Codebreakers]] as one of the first female cryptanalysts whose name has been recorded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_herodotus_7_12.htm |title=Herodotus '&#39;History'&#39; [Translated into English&#93; |publisher=Ancienthistory.about.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2011-07-24}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Plutarch]], before the Battle of Thermopylae, knowing that her husband's death in battle was inevitable, she asked him what to do.
