With an interest in exploring craft skills, he took courses at the local Buffalo [[YWCA]] craft program, where he later taught [[studio pottery|ceramic]] classes. He also took a few classes at the School for American Craftsmen (now the [[School for American Crafts]]) at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]; this interest led   to his membership in the organization Buffalo Craftsmen, where he served as president in 1962, and his active involvement with York State Craftsmen, a state organization that held an annual craft fair in [[Ithaca, New York]].\n\nHe took a position in the display department of the [[Flint & Kent]] department store in 1953, and was appointed Display Director there in 1955.<ref>A brief overview of Smith's early career can be found in Glenn Adamson, \u201cGatherings: Creating the Studio Craft Movement,\u201d in Jeannine Falino, ed., Crafting Modernism: Midcentury American Art and Design (New York: Abrams; Museum of Arts and Design, 2011), p. 41, as well as a biographical entry in the same text, p. 311\u201312.

He also took a few classes at the School for American Craftsmen (now the [[School for American Crafts]]) at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]; this interest led   to his membership in the organization Buffalo Craftsmen, where he served as president in 1962, and his active involvement with York State Craftsmen, a state organization that held an annual craft fair in [[Ithaca, New York]].\n\nHe took a position in the display department of the [[Flint & Kent]] department store in 1953, and was appointed Display Director there in 1955.<ref>A brief overview of Smith's early career can be found in Glenn Adamson, \u201cGatherings: Creating the Studio Craft Movement,\u201d in Jeannine Falino, ed., Crafting Modernism: Midcentury American Art and Design (New York: Abrams; Museum of Arts and Design, 2011), p. 41, as well as a biographical entry in the same text, p. 311\u201312.

He recognizes rapping as salvation from street life, not some gladiatorial clash inside an echo chamber. Meek makes the case there\u2019s more than one way to win, and that being bested in the rap coliseum isn\u2019t nearly as devastating a blow as seeing close friends die.

He recognizes rapping as salvation from street life, not some gladiatorial clash inside an echo chamber. Meek makes the case there\u2019s more than one way to win, and that being bested in the rap coliseum isn\u2019t nearly as devastating a blow as seeing close friends die.
