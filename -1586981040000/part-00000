{"title_page": "History of Switzerland", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{History of Switzerland}}\nSince 1848 the [[Swiss Confederation]] has been a [[federal republic]] of relatively autonomous [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]]s, some of which have a history of confederacy that goes back more than 700 years, putting them among the world's oldest surviving [[republic]]s.\n\n\nThe [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] in the late medieval period (the ''[[Eight Cantons]]'') \nestablished its independence from the [[House of Habsburg]] and the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], and in the [[Italian Wars]] gained territory [[Transalpine campaigns of the Old Swiss Confederacy|south of the Alps]] from the [[Duchy of Milan]].\nThe [[Swiss Reformation]] divided the Confederacy and resulted in a drawn-out history of internal strife between the ''[[Thirteen Cantons]]'' in the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Early Modern period]].\nIn the wake of the [[French Revolution]], Switzerland fell to a [[French invasion of Switzerland|French invasion]] in 1798 and was reformed into the [[Helvetic Republic]], a French client state. Napoleon's ''[[Act of Mediation]]'' in 1803 restored the status of Switzerland as a Confederation, and after the end of the Napoleonic period, the Swiss Confederation underwent a period of [[Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland|turmoil]] culminating in a [[Sonderbund War|brief civil war]] in 1847 and the creation of a [[Switzerland as a federal state|federal constitution]] in 1848.\n\nThe [[Modern history of Switzerland|history of Switzerland since 1848]] has been largely one of success and prosperity. [[Industrialisation]] transformed the traditionally agricultural economy, and [[Swiss neutrality]] [[Switzerland during the World Wars|during the World Wars]] and the success of the [[Banking in Switzerland|banking industry]] furthered the ascent of Switzerland to its status as one of the world's [[Economy of Switzerland|most stable economies]].\n\nSwitzerland signed a free-trade agreement with the [[European Economic Community]] in 1972, and has participated in the process of [[European integration]] by way of [[Switzerland\u2013European Union relations|bilateral treaties]], but it has notably resisted full accession to the [[European Union]] (EU) even though its territory has been surrounded by EU member states since 1995.\n\n==Early history==\n{{Main|Early history of Switzerland}}\n[[File:Divico und Caesar.jpg|thumb|left|Divico and [[Julius Caesar]] after the [[Battle of Bibracte]] ]]\n\n===Prehistory===\n[[Archeology|Archeological]] evidence suggests that hunter-gatherers were already settled in the lowlands north of the [[Swiss Alps|Alps]] in the [[Middle Paleolithic]] period 150,000 years ago.<ref>http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/prehistory-lake-dwellings.html</ref> By the [[Neolithic]] period, the area was relatively densely populated.

The alpine region became integrated into the [[Roman Empire]] and was extensively romanized in the course of the following centuries. The center of Roman administration was at ''Aventicum'' ([[Avenches]]). In 259, [[Alamanni]] tribes overran the [[Germanic Limes|Limes]], putting the settlements on Swiss territory on the frontier of the Roman Empire.\n\n[[File:Historische Karte CH Rome 1.png|thumb|350px|A map of Switzerland during the Roman period]]\n\nThe first Christian bishoprics were founded in the fourth century.\n\nWith the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]], Germanic tribes entered the area. [[Burgundians]] settled in the west; while in the north, [[Alamanni]] settlers slowly forced the earlier Celto-Roman population  to retreat into the mountains. Burgundy became a part of the kingdom of the [[Franks]] in 534; two years later, the dukedom of the Alamans followed suit. In the Alaman-controlled region, only isolated Christian communities continued to exist and [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish monks]] re-introduced the Christian faith in the early 7th century.\n\n===Medieval period===\n{{main| Switzerland in the Middle Ages}}\nUnder the [[Carolingian]] kings, the [[feudalism|feudal system]] proliferated, and monasteries and bishoprics were important bases for maintaining the rule. The [[Treaty of Verdun]] of 843 assigned [[Upper Burgundy]] (the western part of what is today Switzerland) to [[Lotharingia]], and [[Alemannia]] (the eastern part) to the eastern kingdom of [[Louis the German]] which would become part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nIn the 10th century, as the rule of the Carolingians waned, [[Magyars]] destroyed [[Basel]] in 917 and [[St. Gallen]] in 926. Only after the victory of King [[Otto I The Great|Otto I]] over the Magyars in 955 in the [[Battle of Lechfeld]], were the Swiss territories reintegrated into the empire.\n\nIn the 12th century, the dukes of [[House of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]] were given authority over part of the Burgundy territories which covered the western part of modern Switzerland. They founded many cities, including [[Fribourg]] in 1157, and [[Bern]] in 1191. The Z\u00e4hringer dynasty ended with the death of [[Berchtold V of Z\u00e4hringen|Berchtold V]] in 1218, and their cities subsequently became ''[[reichsfrei]]'' (essentially a city-state within the Holy Roman Empire), while the dukes of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] competed with the house of [[Habsburg]] over control of the rural regions of the former Z\u00e4hringer territory.\n\nUnder the [[Hohenstaufen]] rule, the alpine passes in Raetia and the [[St Gotthard Pass]] gained importance. The latter especially became an important direct route through the mountains. [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] (in 1231) and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] (in 1240) were  accorded the ''[[Reichsfreiheit]]'' to grant the empire direct control over the mountain pass. Most of the territory of [[Unterwalden]] at this time belonged to monasteries which had previously become reichsfrei.\n\nThe extinction of the [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] dynasty paved the way for the Habsburg dynasty to bring much of the territory south of the Rhine under their control, aiding their rise to power. [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]], who became King of Germany in 1273, effectively revoked the status of ''Reichsfreiheit'' granted to the \"Forest Cantons\" of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden.   The Forest Cantons thus lost their independent status and were governed by [[Vogt|reeve]]s.\n\n==Old Confederacy (1300\u20131798)==\n{{main|Old Swiss Confederacy}}\n[[File:Battle of Laupen.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Laupen]] (1339) between Swiss forces and an army of the [[Dukes of Savoy]] ([[Diebold Schilling the Elder]], 1480s).]]\n\n===Late Medieval period===\n{{Main|Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy}}\n\nOn 1 August 1291, the cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden united to defend the peace upon the death of Emperor Rudolf I of Habsburg, forming the nucleus of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]].\n\nBy 1353, the three original cantons had been joined by the cantons of [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]] and the city states of [[Lucerne]], [[Z\u00fcrich]], and [[Bern]], forming the \"Old Federation\" of eight states that persisted during much of the 15th century. \nAt the battle of [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]] 1386, the Swiss defeated the Habsburgs, gaining increased autonomy within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nZ\u00fcrich was expelled from the Confederation from 1440 to 1450 due to a conflict over the territory of [[Toggenburg (Switzerland)|Toggenburg]] (the [[Old Z\u00fcrich War]]). The Confederation's power and wealth increased significantly, with victories over [[Charles the Bold]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] during the 1470s and the success of Swiss [[mercenary|mercenaries]].\n\nThe traditional listing order of the [[cantons of Switzerland]] reflects this state, listing the eight \"Old Cantons\" first, with the city states preceding the founding cantons, followed by cantons that joined the Confederation after 1481, in historical order.\n\nThe Swiss defeated  the [[Swabian League]] in 1499 and gained greater collective autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire, including exemption from the Imperial reforms of 1495 and immunity from most Imperial courts. In 1506, Pope [[Julius II]] engaged the [[Swiss Guard]], which continues to serve the papacy to the present day. The expansion of the Confederation and the reputation of invincibility acquired during the earlier wars suffered a first setback in 1515 with the Swiss defeat in the [[Battle of Marignano]].\n\n===Reformation ===\n{{Main|Reformation in Switzerland}}\n\nThe [[Reformation in Switzerland]] began in 1523, led by [[Huldrych Zwingli]], priest of the [[Great Minster church]] in Z\u00fcrich since 1518. Z\u00fcrich adopted the [[Protestant]] religion, joined by Berne, Basel, and Schaffhausen, while Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Nidwalden, Zug, Fribourg and Solothurn remained Catholic. Glarus and Appenzell were split. This led to multiple inter-cantonal religious wars ([[Wars of Kappel|''Kappeler Kriege'']]) in 1529 and 1531, because each canton usually made the opposing religion illegal, and to the formation of two diets, the Protestant one meeting in Aarau and the Catholic one in Lucerne (as well as the formal full diet still meeting usually in Baden)<ref>Hughes, Christopher, ''Switzerland'' (London, 1975) p.66 ff, 84.</ref><ref>Bonjour, Edgar ''et al.'' ''A short History of Switzerland'' (Oxford, 1952) p.191.</ref> but the Confederation survived.\n\n===Early Modern Switzerland===\n{{Main|Early Modern Switzerland}}\n\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]], Switzerland was a relative \"oasis of peace and prosperity\" ([[Hans Jacob Christoph von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]]) in war-torn Europe, mostly because all major powers in Europe depended on Swiss mercenaries, and would not let Switzerland fall into the hands of one of their rivals. Politically, they all tried to take influence, by way of mercenary commanders such as [[J\u00f6rg Jenatsch]] or [[Johann Rudolf Wettstein]]. The ''Drei B\u00fcnde'' of [[Grisons]], at that point not yet a member of the Confederacy, were involved in the war from 1620, which led to their loss of the [[Valtellina]] in 1623.\n\n[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonhard Euler]] (1707\u201383), one of the most prominent scientists in the Age of Enlightenment]]\n\nAt the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, Switzerland attained legal independence from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Valtellina became a dependency of the ''Drei B\u00fcnde'' again after the Treaty and remained so until the founding of the [[Cisalpine Republic]] by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1797.\n\nIn 1653, peasants of territories subject to [[Lucerne]], [[Bern]], [[Solothurn]], and [[Basel]] revolted because of currency devaluation. Although the authorities prevailed in this [[Swiss peasant war]], they did pass some tax reforms and the incident in the long term prevented an [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] development as would occur at some other courts of Europe. The confessional tensions remained, however, and erupted again in the [[First War of Villmergen]], in 1656, and the [[Toggenburg War]] (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.\n\n==Napoleonic period and aftermath (1798\u20131848)==\n\n===French invasion and Helvetic Republic===\n{{Main|Switzerland in the Napoleonic era|Helvetic Republic}}\nDuring the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the French army [[French invasion of Switzerland|invaded Switzerland]] and turned it into an ally known as the \"[[Helvetic Republic]]\" (1798\u20131803).  It had a central government with little role for cantons. The interference with localism and traditional liberties was deeply resented, although some modernizing reforms took place.<ref>Marc H.  Lerner, \"The Helvetic Republic: An Ambivalent Reception of French Revolutionary Liberty,\" ''French History'' (2004) 18#1 pp 50-75.</ref><ref>R.R. Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution'' 2:394-421</ref>\n\nResistance was strongest in the more traditional Catholic bastions, with armed uprisings breaking out in spring 1798 in the central part of Switzerland. The French Army suppressed the uprisings but support for revolutionary ideas steadily declined. The reform element was weak, and most Swiss resented their loss of local democracy, the centralization, the new  taxes, the warfare, and the hostility to religion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Otto Dann and John Dinwiddy|title=Nationalism in the Age of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrujM36H7qUC&pg=PA194|year=1988|publisher=Continuum|pages=190\u201398|isbn=9780907628972}}</ref>\n\nMajor steps taken to emancipate the Jews included the repeal of special taxes and oaths in 1798. However, reaction took place in 1815, and not until 1879 were the Jews granted equal rights with the Christians.<ref>Holger B\u00f6ning, \"B\u00fcrgerliche Revolution und Judenemanzipation in der Schweiz,\" ''Jahrbuch des Instituts f\u00fcr Deutsche Geschichte'' (1985), Vol. 14, pp 157-180</ref>\n\nIn 1803, Napoleon's [[Act of Mediation]] partially restored the sovereignty of the cantons, and the former tributary and allied territories of [[Aargau]], [[Thurgau]], Grisons, [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]], [[Vaud]] and [[Ticino]] became cantons with equal rights. Napoleon and his enemies fought numerous campaigns in Switzerland that ruined many localities.\n\n===Restoration and Regeneration ===\n{{main|Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland}}\nThe [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814\u201315 fully [[Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland|reestablished Swiss independence]] and the European powers agreed to recognize permanent Swiss neutrality. At this time, [[Valais]], [[Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel]] and [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] also joined Switzerland as new cantons, thereby [[Enlargement of Switzerland|extending Swiss territory]] to its current boundaries.\n\nThe long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed as (by William Martin): \n:It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.<ref>William Martin, ''Histoire de la Suisse'' (Paris, 1926), pp 187-88, quoted in Crane Brinson, ''A Decade of Revolution: 1789-1799'' (1934) p. 235</ref>\n\nOn 6 April 1814, the so-called \"[[Long Diet]]\" (delegates from all the nineteen cantons) met at [[Zurich]] to replace the constitution.<ref>Wilhelm Oechsli, ''History of Switzerland 1499-1914'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 365.</ref>\n\nCantonal constitutions were worked out independently from 1814, in general restoring the late feudal conditions of the 17th and 18th century. The [[Tagsatzung]] was re-organized by the [[Federal Treaty]] (''Bundesvertrag'') of 7 August 1815.\n\nThe liberal [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland]]  was strong in the largely Protestant cantons obtained the majority in the [[Tagsatzung|Federal Diet]] in the early 1840s. It proposed a new Constitution for the Swiss Confederation which would draw the several cantons into a closer relationship.  In addition to the centralization of the Swiss government, the new Constitution also included protections for trade and other progressive reform measures. The Federal Diet, with the approval of a majority of cantons, had taken measures against the Catholic Church such as the closure of monasteries and convents in [[Aargau]] in 1841,<ref name = \"EB\">{{cite EB1911 |first=William Augustus Brevoort |last=Coolidge |wstitle = Switzerland/History/Constitution |volume = 26 |page = 259}}</ref> and the seizure of their properties. Catholic Lucerne, in retaliation, in 1844 recalled the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] to head its education. That succeeded and seven Catholic cantons formed the \"Sonderbund.\" This caused a liberal-radical move in the Protestant cantons to take control of the national Diet in 1847.  The Diet ordered the Sonderbund dissolved, igniting a small-scale civil war against rural cantons were strongholds of pro-Catholic [[ultramontanism]].<ref>William L. Langer, ''Political and social Upheaval 1832-1852'' (1969): 133-37.</ref>\n\n===Sonderbund War of 1847===\n{{Main|Sonderbund War|Switzerland as a federal state}}\n[[File:Swiss denominations in 1800.jpg|thumb|350px|Religious geography in 1800 (orange: Protestant, green: Catholic).]]\n\nThe Radical-liberal-Protestant element charged that the ''Sonderbund'' was in violation of the [[Federal Treaty]] of 1815, \u00a76 of which expressly forbade such separate alliances. Forming a majority in the Tagsatzung they decided to dissolve the Sonderbund on October 21, 1847.<ref>W. B. Duffield, \"The War of the Sonderbund\" ''English Historical Review'' 10#40 (1895), pp. 675-698 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/548178 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Joachim Remak, ''A Very Civil War: The Swiss Sonderbund War of 1847'' (Westview, 1993) [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=97651664 online edition]</ref> The odds were against the Catholics, who were heavily outnumbered in population; they were outnumbered in soldiers by 79,000 to 99,000, and lacked enough well-trained soldiers, officers and generals.   When the Sonderbund refused to disband, the national army attacked in a brief civil war between the Catholic and the Protestant cantons, known as the ''Sonderbundskrieg'' (\"Sonderbund War\".) The national army was composed of soldiers of all the other cantons except [[Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel]] and [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] (which remained neutral).  The Sonderbund was easily defeated in less than a month; there were about 130 killed.  Apart from small riots, this was the last armed conflict on Swiss territory.<ref>Ralph Weaver, ''Three Weeks in November: A Military History of the Swiss Civil War of 1847'' (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Three-Weeks-November-Military-History/dp/1908916575 excerpt]</ref>  Many Sonderband leaders fled to Italy, but the victors were generous. They invited the defeated cantons to join them in a program of federal reform, and a new constitution was drafted along American lines. National issues were to be under the control  of the national parliament, and the Jesuits were expelled. The Swiss voted heavily in favor of the new constitution by 2 million against 300,000. Switzerland became calm. However conservatives around Europe became frightened, and prepared their own forces to meet possible challenges, which indeed soon exploded the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. In those violent revolutions, outside Switzerland, the conservatives were always successful.<ref>Langer, ''Political and Social upheaval'' pp 135-37</ref>\n\n==Modern Switzerland (1848\u2013present)==\n{{main|Modern history of Switzerland}}\n\n===Industrialisation===\nAs a consequence of the civil war, Switzerland adopted a [[Swiss Federal Constitution|federal constitution]] in 1848, amending it extensively in 1874 and establishing federal responsibility for defense, trade, and legal matters, leaving all other matters to the cantonal governments. From then, and over much of the 20th century, continuous political, economic, and social improvement has characterized Swiss history.\n\nWhile Switzerland was primarily rural, the cities experienced an industrial revolution in the late 19th century, focused especially on textiles. In Basel, for example, textiles, including silk, were the leading industry. In 1888 women made up 44% of the wage earners. Nearly half the women worked in the textile mills, with household servants the second largest job category. The share of women in the workforce was higher between 1890 and 1910 than it was in the late 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Regina Wecker, \"Frauenlohnarbeit - Statistik und Wirklichkeit in der Schweiz an der Wende zum 20,\" ''Jahrhundert  Schweizerische Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geschichte'' (1984) 34#3 pp 346-356.</ref> \n[[File:Dampfzug G\u00f6schenen.jpg|thumb|[[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard line]] in 1882]]\n\nSwiss Universities in the late 19th century are notable for the number of female students receiving  medical education.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Holmes | first = Madelyn | title = Go to Switzerland, young women, if you want to study medicine | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 243\u2013245 | doi = 10.1016/0277-5395(84)90048-7 | date = 1984 | ref = harv }}\n{{Cite journal | last = Bonner | first = Thomas N. | title = Medical women abroad: a new dimension of women's push for opportunity in medicine, 1850-1914 | journal = [[Bulletin of the History of Medicine]] | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 58\u201373  | date = Spring 1988 | pmid = 3285925 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n===World Wars (1914\u20131945)===\n{{Main|Switzerland during the World Wars}}\n\nThe major powers respected Switzerland's neutrality during [[World War I]].

Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.\n\nSwitzerland's trade was blockaded by both the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and by the [[Axis Powers|Axis]]. Both sides openly exerted pressure on Switzerland not to trade with the other. Economic cooperation and extension of credit to the Third Reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion, and the availability of other trading partners. Concessions reached their zenith after a crucial rail link through [[Vichy France]] was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland completely surrounded by the Axis. Switzerland relied on trade for half of its food and essentially all of its fuel, but controlled vital trans-alpine rail tunnels between Germany and Italy.\n\nSwitzerland's most important exports during the war were precision machine tools, watches, jewel bearings (used in bombsights), electricity, and dairy products. During World War Two, the [[Swiss franc]] was the only remaining major freely convertible currency in the world, and both the Allies and the Germans sold large amounts of gold to the [[Swiss National Bank]]. Between 1940 and 1945, the German [[Reichsbank]] sold 1.3 billion francs worth of gold to Swiss Banks in exchange for Swiss francs and other foreign currency.<ref>The Bergier Commission Final Report, page 238 http://www.uek.ch/en/.</ref>\n\nHundreds of millions of francs worth of this gold was [[Gold standard|monetary gold]] plundered from the [[central bank]]s of occupied countries. 581,000 francs of \"Melmer\" gold taken from [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victims in eastern Europe was sold to Swiss banks.<ref>The Bergier Commission Final Report, page 249 http://www.uek.ch/en/.</ref> In total, trade between Germany and Switzerland contributed about 0.5% to the German war effort but did not significantly lengthen the war.<ref>The Bergier Commission Final Report, page 518 http://www.uek.ch/en/.</ref>\n\nOver the course of the war, Switzerland interned 300,000 refugees.<ref>{{HDS|10374|Asylum}}</ref> 104,000 of these were foreign troops interned according to the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers outlined in the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]].

The government attempted to thwart the activities of any individual, party, or faction in Switzerland that acted with extremism or attempted to break the unity of the nation. The Swiss-German speaking areas moved linguistically further away from the standard (high) German spoken in Germany, with more emphasis on local Swiss dialects.\n\nIn the 1960s, significant controversy arose among historians regarding the nation's relations with Nazi Germany.<ref>Hadrien Buclin, \"'Surmonter le pass\u00e9?': les intellectuels de gauche et le d\u00e9bat des ann\u00e9es soixante sur la deuxi\u00e8me guerre mondiale,\" [\"Overcoming the Past?\": Intellectuals on the Left and the Debate of the 1960s About the Second World War] ''Schweizerische Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geschichte'' (2013) 63#2 pp 233-249.</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s the controversies included a [[World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss Banks|class-action lawsuit]] brought in New York over Jewish assets in Holocaust-era bank accounts.

Switzerland was inhabited by the Helvetii, and it came under [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman rule]] in the 1st century BC. [[Gallo-Roman culture]] was amalgamated with [[Migration period|Germanic influence]] during [[Late Antiquity]], with the eastern part of Switzerland becoming [[Alemanni]]c territory. The area of Switzerland was incorporated in the [[Frankish Empire]] in the 6th century. In the high medieval period, the eastern part became part of the [[Duchy of Swabia]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] while the western part was part of [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]].\n\nThe [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] in the late medieval period (the ''[[Eight Cantons]]'') \nestablished its independence from the [[House of Habsburg]] and the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], and in the [[Italian Wars]] gained territory [[Transalpine campaigns of the Old Swiss Confederacy|south of the Alps]] from the [[Duchy of Milan]].\nThe [[Swiss Reformation]] divided the Confederacy and resulted in a drawn-out history of internal strife between the ''[[Thirteen Cantons]]'' in the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Early Modern period]].\nIn the wake of the [[French Revolution]], Switzerland fell to a [[French invasion of Switzerland|French invasion]] in 1798 and was reformed into the [[Helvetic Republic]], a French client state. Napoleon's ''[[Act of Mediation]]'' in 1803 restored the status of Switzerland as a Confederation, and after the end of the Napoleonic period, the Swiss Confederation underwent a period of [[Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland|turmoil]] culminating in a [[Sonderbund War|brief civil war]] in 1847 and the creation of a [[Switzerland as a federal state|federal constitution]] in 1848.\n\nThe [[Modern history of Switzerland|history of Switzerland since 1848]] has been largely one of success and prosperity. [[Industrialisation]] transformed the traditionally agricultural economy, and [[Swiss neutrality]] [[Switzerland during the World Wars|during the World Wars]] and the success of the [[Banking in Switzerland|banking industry]] furthered the ascent of Switzerland to its status as one of the world's [[Economy of Switzerland|most stable economies]].\n\nSwitzerland signed a free-trade agreement with the [[European Economic Community]] in 1972, and has participated in the process of [[European integration]] by way of [[Switzerland\u2013European Union relations|bilateral treaties]], but it has notably resisted full accession to the [[European Union]] (EU) even though its territory has been surrounded by EU member states since 1995.\n\n==Early history==\n{{Main|Early history of Switzerland}}\n[[File:Divico und Caesar.jpg|thumb|left|Divico and [[Julius Caesar]] after the [[Battle of Bibracte]] ]]\n\n===Prehistory===\n[[Archeology|Archeological]] evidence suggests that hunter-gatherers were already settled in the lowlands north of the [[Swiss Alps|Alps]] in the [[Middle Paleolithic]] period 150,000 years ago.<ref>http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/prehistory-lake-dwellings.html</ref> By the [[Neolithic]] period, the area was relatively densely populated.

The alpine region became integrated into the [[Roman Empire]] and was extensively romanized in the course of the following centuries. The center of Roman administration was at ''Aventicum'' ([[Avenches]]). In 259, [[Alamanni]] tribes overran the [[Germanic Limes|Limes]], putting the settlements on Swiss territory on the frontier of the Roman Empire.\n\n[[File:Historische Karte CH Rome 1.png|thumb|350px|A map of Switzerland during the Roman period]]\n\nThe first Christian bishoprics were founded in the fourth century.\n\nWith the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]], Germanic tribes entered the area. [[Burgundians]] settled in the west; while in the north, [[Alamanni]] settlers slowly forced the earlier Celto-Roman population  to retreat into the mountains. Burgundy became a part of the kingdom of the [[Franks]] in 534; two years later, the dukedom of the Alamans followed suit. In the Alaman-controlled region, only isolated Christian communities continued to exist and [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish monks]] re-introduced the Christian faith in the early 7th century.\n\n===Medieval period===\n{{main| Switzerland in the Middle Ages}}\nUnder the [[Carolingian]] kings, the [[feudalism|feudal system]] proliferated, and monasteries and bishoprics were important bases for maintaining the rule. The [[Treaty of Verdun]] of 843 assigned [[Upper Burgundy]] (the western part of what is today Switzerland) to [[Lotharingia]], and [[Alemannia]] (the eastern part) to the eastern kingdom of [[Louis the German]] which would become part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nIn the 10th century, as the rule of the Carolingians waned, [[Magyars]] destroyed [[Basel]] in 917 and [[St. Gallen]] in 926. Only after the victory of King [[Otto I The Great|Otto I]] over the Magyars in 955 in the [[Battle of Lechfeld]], were the Swiss territories reintegrated into the empire.\n\nIn the 12th century, the dukes of [[House of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]] were given authority over part of the Burgundy territories which covered the western part of modern Switzerland. They founded many cities, including [[Fribourg]] in 1157, and [[Bern]] in 1191. The Z\u00e4hringer dynasty ended with the death of [[Berchtold V of Z\u00e4hringen|Berchtold V]] in 1218, and their cities subsequently became ''[[reichsfrei]]'' (essentially a city-state within the Holy Roman Empire), while the dukes of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] competed with the house of [[Habsburg]] over control of the rural regions of the former Z\u00e4hringer territory.\n\nUnder the [[Hohenstaufen]] rule, the alpine passes in Raetia and the [[St Gotthard Pass]] gained importance. The latter especially became an important direct route through the mountains. [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] (in 1231) and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] (in 1240) were  accorded the ''[[Reichsfreiheit]]'' to grant the empire direct control over the mountain pass. Most of the territory of [[Unterwalden]] at this time belonged to monasteries which had previously become reichsfrei.\n\nThe extinction of the [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] dynasty paved the way for the Habsburg dynasty to bring much of the territory south of the Rhine under their control, aiding their rise to power. [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]], who became King of Germany in 1273, effectively revoked the status of ''Reichsfreiheit'' granted to the \"Forest Cantons\" of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden.   The Forest Cantons thus lost their independent status and were governed by [[Vogt|reeve]]s.\n\n==Old Confederacy (1300\u20131798)==\n{{main|Old Swiss Confederacy}}\n[[File:Battle of Laupen.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Laupen]] (1339) between Swiss forces and an army of the [[Dukes of Savoy]] ([[Diebold Schilling the Elder]], 1480s).]]\n\n===Late Medieval period===\n{{Main|Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy}}\n\nOn 1 August 1291, the cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden united to defend the peace upon the death of Emperor Rudolf I of Habsburg, forming the nucleus of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]].\n\nBy 1353, the three original cantons had been joined by the cantons of [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]] and the city states of [[Lucerne]], [[Z\u00fcrich]], and [[Bern]], forming the \"Old Federation\" of eight states that persisted during much of the 15th century. \nAt the battle of [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]] 1386, the Swiss defeated the Habsburgs, gaining increased autonomy within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nZ\u00fcrich was expelled from the Confederation from 1440 to 1450 due to a conflict over the territory of [[Toggenburg (Switzerland)|Toggenburg]] (the [[Old Z\u00fcrich War]]). The Confederation's power and wealth increased significantly, with victories over [[Charles the Bold]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] during the 1470s and the success of Swiss [[mercenary|mercenaries]].\n\nThe traditional listing order of the [[cantons of Switzerland]] reflects this state, listing the eight \"Old Cantons\" first, with the city states preceding the founding cantons, followed by cantons that joined the Confederation after 1481, in historical order.\n\nThe Swiss defeated  the [[Swabian League]] in 1499 and gained greater collective autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire, including exemption from the Imperial reforms of 1495 and immunity from most Imperial courts. In 1506, Pope [[Julius II]] engaged the [[Swiss Guard]], which continues to serve the papacy to the present day. The expansion of the Confederation and the reputation of invincibility acquired during the earlier wars suffered a first setback in 1515 with the Swiss defeat in the [[Battle of Marignano]].\n\n===Reformation ===\n{{Main|Reformation in Switzerland}}\n\nThe [[Reformation in Switzerland]] began in 1523, led by [[Huldrych Zwingli]], priest of the [[Great Minster church]] in Z\u00fcrich since 1518. Z\u00fcrich adopted the [[Protestant]] religion, joined by Berne, Basel, and Schaffhausen, while Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Nidwalden, Zug, Fribourg and Solothurn remained Catholic. Glarus and Appenzell were split. This led to multiple inter-cantonal religious wars ([[Wars of Kappel|''Kappeler Kriege'']]) in 1529 and 1531, because each canton usually made the opposing religion illegal, and to the formation of two diets, the Protestant one meeting in Aarau and the Catholic one in Lucerne (as well as the formal full diet still meeting usually in Baden)<ref>Hughes, Christopher, ''Switzerland'' (London, 1975) p.66 ff, 84.</ref><ref>Bonjour, Edgar ''et al.'' ''A short History of Switzerland'' (Oxford, 1952) p.191.</ref> but the Confederation survived.\n\n===Early Modern Switzerland===\n{{Main|Early Modern Switzerland}}\n\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]], Switzerland was a relative \"oasis of peace and prosperity\" ([[Hans Jacob Christoph von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]]) in war-torn Europe, mostly because all major powers in Europe depended on Swiss mercenaries, and would not let Switzerland fall into the hands of one of their rivals. Politically, they all tried to take influence, by way of mercenary commanders such as [[J\u00f6rg Jenatsch]] or [[Johann Rudolf Wettstein]]. The ''Drei B\u00fcnde'' of [[Grisons]], at that point not yet a member of the Confederacy, were involved in the war from 1620, which led to their loss of the [[Valtellina]] in 1623.\n\n[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonhard Euler]] (1707\u201383), one of the most prominent scientists in the Age of Enlightenment]]\n\nAt the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, Switzerland attained legal independence from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Valtellina became a dependency of the ''Drei B\u00fcnde'' again after the Treaty and remained so until the founding of the [[Cisalpine Republic]] by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1797.\n\nIn 1653, peasants of territories subject to [[Lucerne]], [[Bern]], [[Solothurn]], and [[Basel]] revolted because of currency devaluation. Although the authorities prevailed in this [[Swiss peasant war]], they did pass some tax reforms and the incident in the long term prevented an [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] development as would occur at some other courts of Europe. The confessional tensions remained, however, and erupted again in the [[First War of Villmergen]], in 1656, and the [[Toggenburg War]] (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.\n\n==Napoleonic period and aftermath (1798\u20131848)==\n\n===French invasion and Helvetic Republic===\n{{Main|Switzerland in the Napoleonic era|Helvetic Republic}}\nDuring the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the French army [[French invasion of Switzerland|invaded Switzerland]] and turned it into an ally known as the \"[[Helvetic Republic]]\" (1798\u20131803).

The French Army suppressed the uprisings but support for revolutionary ideas steadily declined. The reform element was weak, and most Swiss resented their loss of local democracy, the centralization, the new  taxes, the warfare, and the hostility to religion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Otto Dann and John Dinwiddy|title=Nationalism in the Age of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrujM36H7qUC&pg=PA194|year=1988|publisher=Continuum|pages=190\u201398|isbn=9780907628972}}</ref>\n\nMajor steps taken to emancipate the Jews included the repeal of special taxes and oaths in 1798.

Napoleon and his enemies fought numerous campaigns in Switzerland that ruined many localities.\n\n===Restoration and Regeneration ===\n{{main|Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland}}\nThe [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814\u201315 fully [[Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland|reestablished Swiss independence]] and the European powers agreed to recognize permanent Swiss neutrality. At this time, [[Valais]], [[Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel]] and [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] also joined Switzerland as new cantons, thereby [[Enlargement of Switzerland|extending Swiss territory]] to its current boundaries.\n\nThe long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed as (by William Martin): \n:It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.<ref>William Martin, ''Histoire de la Suisse'' (Paris, 1926), pp 187-88, quoted in Crane Brinson, ''A Decade of Revolution: 1789-1799'' (1934) p. 235</ref>\n\nOn 6 April 1814, the so-called \"[[Long Diet]]\" (delegates from all the nineteen cantons) met at [[Zurich]] to replace the constitution.<ref>Wilhelm Oechsli, ''History of Switzerland 1499-1914'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 365.</ref>\n\nCantonal constitutions were worked out independently from 1814, in general restoring the late feudal conditions of the 17th and 18th century. The [[Tagsatzung]] was re-organized by the [[Federal Treaty]] (''Bundesvertrag'') of 7 August 1815.\n\nThe liberal [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland]]  was strong in the largely Protestant cantons obtained the majority in the [[Tagsatzung|Federal Diet]] in the early 1840s. It proposed a new Constitution for the Swiss Confederation which would draw the several cantons into a closer relationship.  In addition to the centralization of the Swiss government, the new Constitution also included protections for trade and other progressive reform measures. The Federal Diet, with the approval of a majority of cantons, had taken measures against the Catholic Church such as the closure of monasteries and convents in [[Aargau]] in 1841,<ref name = \"EB\">{{cite EB1911 |first=William Augustus Brevoort |last=Coolidge |wstitle = Switzerland/History/Constitution |volume = 26 |page = 259}}</ref> and the seizure of their properties. Catholic Lucerne, in retaliation, in 1844 recalled the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] to head its education. That succeeded and seven Catholic cantons formed the \"Sonderbund.\" This caused a liberal-radical move in the Protestant cantons to take control of the national Diet in 1847.  The Diet ordered the Sonderbund dissolved, igniting a small-scale civil war against rural cantons were strongholds of pro-Catholic [[ultramontanism]].<ref>William L.

Forming a majority in the Tagsatzung they decided to dissolve the Sonderbund on October 21, 1847.<ref>W. B.

When the Sonderbund refused to disband, the national army attacked in a brief civil war between the Catholic and the Protestant cantons, known as the ''Sonderbundskrieg'' (\"Sonderbund War\".) The national army was composed of soldiers of all the other cantons except [[Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel]] and [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] (which remained neutral).  The Sonderbund was easily defeated in less than a month; there were about 130 killed.  Apart from small riots, this was the last armed conflict on Swiss territory.<ref>Ralph Weaver, ''Three Weeks in November: A Military History of the Swiss Civil War of 1847'' (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Three-Weeks-November-Military-History/dp/1908916575 excerpt]</ref>  Many Sonderband leaders fled to Italy, but the victors were generous. They invited the defeated cantons to join them in a program of federal reform, and a new constitution was drafted along American lines. National issues were to be under the control  of the national parliament, and the Jesuits were expelled. The Swiss voted heavily in favor of the new constitution by 2 million against 300,000. Switzerland became calm. However conservatives around Europe became frightened, and prepared their own forces to meet possible challenges, which indeed soon exploded the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. In those violent revolutions, outside Switzerland, the conservatives were always successful.<ref>Langer, ''Political and Social upheaval'' pp 135-37</ref>\n\n==Modern Switzerland (1848\u2013present)==\n{{main|Modern history of Switzerland}}\n\n===Industrialisation===\nAs a consequence of the civil war, Switzerland adopted a [[Swiss Federal Constitution|federal constitution]] in 1848, amending it extensively in 1874 and establishing federal responsibility for defense, trade, and legal matters, leaving all other matters to the cantonal governments. From then, and over much of the 20th century, continuous political, economic, and social improvement has characterized Swiss history.\n\nWhile Switzerland was primarily rural, the cities experienced an industrial revolution in the late 19th century, focused especially on textiles. In Basel, for example, textiles, including silk, were the leading industry. In 1888 women made up 44% of the wage earners. Nearly half the women worked in the textile mills, with household servants the second largest job category. The share of women in the workforce was higher between 1890 and 1910 than it was in the late 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Regina Wecker, \"Frauenlohnarbeit - Statistik und Wirklichkeit in der Schweiz an der Wende zum 20,\" ''Jahrhundert  Schweizerische Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geschichte'' (1984) 34#3 pp 346-356.</ref> \n[[File:Dampfzug G\u00f6schenen.jpg|thumb|[[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard line]] in 1882]]\n\nSwiss Universities in the late 19th century are notable for the number of female students receiving  medical education.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Holmes | first = Madelyn | title = Go to Switzerland, young women, if you want to study medicine | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 243\u2013245 | doi = 10.1016/0277-5395(84)90048-7 | date = 1984 | ref = harv }}\n{{Cite journal | last = Bonner | first = Thomas N. | title = Medical women abroad: a new dimension of women's push for opportunity in medicine, 1850-1914 | journal = [[Bulletin of the History of Medicine]] | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 58\u201373  | date = Spring 1988 | pmid = 3285925 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n===World Wars (1914\u20131945)===\n{{Main|Switzerland during the World Wars}}\n\nThe major powers respected Switzerland's neutrality during [[World War I]].

Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.\n\nSwitzerland's trade was blockaded by both the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and by the [[Axis Powers|Axis]]. Both sides openly exerted pressure on Switzerland not to trade with the other. Economic cooperation and extension of credit to the Third Reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion, and the availability of other trading partners. Concessions reached their zenith after a crucial rail link through [[Vichy France]] was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland completely surrounded by the Axis. Switzerland relied on trade for half of its food and essentially all of its fuel, but controlled vital trans-alpine rail tunnels between Germany and Italy.\n\nSwitzerland's most important exports during the war were precision machine tools, watches, jewel bearings (used in bombsights), electricity, and dairy products. During World War Two, the [[Swiss franc]] was the only remaining major freely convertible currency in the world, and both the Allies and the Germans sold large amounts of gold to the [[Swiss National Bank]]. Between 1940 and 1945, the German [[Reichsbank]] sold 1.3 billion francs worth of gold to Swiss Banks in exchange for Swiss francs and other foreign currency.<ref>The Bergier Commission Final Report, page 238 http://www.uek.ch/en/.</ref>\n\nHundreds of millions of francs worth of this gold was [[Gold standard|monetary gold]] plundered from the [[central bank]]s of occupied countries. 581,000 francs of \"Melmer\" gold taken from [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victims in eastern Europe was sold to Swiss banks.<ref>The Bergier Commission Final Report, page 249 http://www.uek.ch/en/.</ref> In total, trade between Germany and Switzerland contributed about 0.5% to the German war effort but did not significantly lengthen the war.<ref>The Bergier Commission Final Report, page 518 http://www.uek.ch/en/.</ref>\n\nOver the course of the war, Switzerland interned 300,000 refugees.<ref>{{HDS|10374|Asylum}}</ref> 104,000 of these were foreign troops interned according to the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers outlined in the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]].

Some were pacifists. Some took sides according to international capitalism or international communism. Others leaned more towards their language group, with some in French-speaking areas more pro-Allied, and some in Swiss-German areas more pro-Axis. The government attempted to thwart the activities of any individual, party, or faction in Switzerland that acted with extremism or attempted to break the unity of the nation. The Swiss-German speaking areas moved linguistically further away from the standard (high) German spoken in Germany, with more emphasis on local Swiss dialects.\n\nIn the 1960s, significant controversy arose among historians regarding the nation's relations with Nazi Germany.<ref>Hadrien Buclin, \"'Surmonter le pass\u00e9?': les intellectuels de gauche et le d\u00e9bat des ann\u00e9es soixante sur la deuxi\u00e8me guerre mondiale,\" [\"Overcoming the Past?\": Intellectuals on the Left and the Debate of the 1960s About the Second World War] ''Schweizerische Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geschichte'' (2013) 63#2 pp 233-249.</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s the controversies included a [[World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss Banks|class-action lawsuit]] brought in New York over Jewish assets in Holocaust-era bank accounts.

The core storyline focuses on a plantation owned by Sintil, the local oungan (vodou priest), and run by zonbis. The zonbis, humans brought back to life from a death-like state by an oungan to work, are essentially slaves. They cannot speak, cannot think, and have no more cognitive function than is required to work the plantation. \n\nSintil controls the zonbis with the help of his daughter Siltana and a hired man named Zof\u00e8. Sintil frequently reminds Siltana that she must remember to never give the zonbis salt because if they taste it they will wake up. At the beginning of the book Siltana is happy to follow her father's directives and it is even implied they have a sexual relationship. However when a new zonbi named Klodonis is brought to the plantation she falls in love with him and loses interest in her normal duties on the ranch. She is devestated by the fact that Klodonis is in a permenant stupor and cannot reciprocate her feelings. Her frustration buillds throughout the book until at last, in desperation, she gives Klodonis salt and restores him to being fully human. Unfortunately, far from being in love with her, Klodonis knocks her to the floor and immediately revives the rest of the zonbis, launching a rebellion against Sintil which eventually spreads to the village and culminates in Sintil's bloody demise.\n\nThe majority of the main plotline happens in the very end of the book. There are, however, several smaller plotlines sprinkled throughout ''D\u00e9zafi,'' which focus on other villagers in Bouan\u00e8f and how their lives are affected by Sintil\u2019s presence. J\u00e9r\u00f2m, for example, is a villager who hides in his brother\u2019s attic for almost the entirety of the book out of fear of Sintil. Another character, Gaston, uses his winnings from a lucky day at gambling to travel to Port-au-Prince. Unfortunately, once there he cannot earn enough money to make a stable living and languishes on the streets for years, before attempting to return to Bouan\u00e8f just as the the revolution is taking place. Rather than return to the chaotic village he turns around and walks back towards Port-au-Prince. Still another villager, J\u00e9d\u00e9yon, lives alone in an old house with his niece Rita. J\u00e9d\u00e9yon has been abandoned by his wife and family who left for the United States without him and he constantly berates and chastises Rita, who takes care of him and the house. He dies before the rebellion.\n\nThere is an additional abstract plotline which centers on a series of cock fight (d\u00e9zafis, in Haitian). When Sintil is at last apprehended and killed it is at one of these cock fights. \n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Franketienne Painting.jpg|thumb|318x318px|An untitled spiralist painting by Frank\u00e9tienne. |alt=]]\nDue to its spiralist influences, ''D\u00e9zafi'' is unconventional in structure and formatting.

And as Sintil was only overthrown once the ''zonbis'' had their humanity restored, Frank\u00e9tienne implies that an uprising can only take place once the people of Haiti awaken from their subservient stupor.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nUnfortunately, at the time of ''D\u00e9zafi''<nowiki/>'s publication much of Haiti was illiterate and thus could not access Frank\u00e9tienne\u2019s message.

For this reason he later switched to writing plays, which the ordinary citizen could access.

For this reason he later switched to writing plays, which the ordinary citizen could access.

[[Social skills]], behavioral skills, and someone's way of thinking are just some of the things that the human brain develops at an early age. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn. This starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are some people in society who have difficulty with these kind of skills and behaving like an average person. This is most likely the cause of having a mental illness. A mental illness consist of a wide range of conditions that affects a person's mood, thinking, and behavior. About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though there are many that will develop one, even as early as age three.\n\nThe most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to [[anxiety disorder]], as well as [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]] in older children and teens.

His research stated \u201c Homelessness itself is a risk factor for emotional disorder\u201d. What this quote is saying is that being homeless itself can cause emotional disorder. Without looking for other reasons for emotional disorder and really looking at the simple fact that an individual is homeless can cause emotional disorder. Godman\u2019s article stated \u201cRecently, Smith ( 1991) investigated the prevalence of PTSD among a sample of 300 randomly selected homeless single women and mothers in St. Louis, Mis- souri. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, 1981; Robins & Helzer, 1984), she found that 53% of the respondents could be diagnosed as exhibiting full-blown cases of PTSD\u201d. As the source explains, the conclusion that was drawn from Smith\u2019s investigation after studying 300 homeless individuals is that 53% of those people were eligible to be diagnosed with PTSD. She continues and states\u201c In addition, data from clinical observations, self-reports, and empirical studies suggest that at least two commonly reported symptoms of psychological trauma, social disaffiliation and learned helplessness are highly prevalent among homeless individuals and families.\u201d Other datas were able to prove that PTSD and learned helplessness were two symptoms that were very much present among homeless individuals and families.

It states \u201cFor homeless people with mental illness, case management linked to other services was effective in improving psychiatric symptoms, and assertive case management was effective in decreasing psychiatric hospitalizations and increasing outpatient contacts. For homeless people with substance abuse problems, case management resulted in greater decreases in substance use than did usual care\u201d. The question would be how are these people being helped.

Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, \"even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints\".\n\nThe World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. \n\"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet needs for treatment. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care.\"\n\nKnowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa ([[Nigeria]], South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific ([[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with [[World Bank]] criteria as [[Low income|low-income]] ([[Nigeria]]), lower middle-income ([[China]], [[Colombia]], [[South Africa]], [[Ukraine]]), higher middle-income ([[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]]), and high-income.\n\nThe coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that \"the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of [[gross domestic product]] spent on health care\".\n\"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since [[WHO]] Project [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in [[low-income]] and [[middle-income]] countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually <1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill-equipped for it\".\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Older methods of treatment===\n\n=== Trepanation ===\n\nArchaeological records have shown that [[trepanation]] was a procedure used to treat \"headaches, insanities or [[epilepsy]]\" in several parts of the world in the Stone age. It was a surgical process used in the [[Stone Age]]. [[Paul Broca]] studied trepanation and came up with his own theory on it. He noticed that the fractures on the skulls dug up weren't caused by wounds inflicted due to violence, but because of careful surgical procedures. \"Doctors used sharpened stones to scrape the skull and drill holes into the head of the patient\" to allow evil spirits which plagued the patient to escape. There were several patients that died in these procedures, but those that survived were revered and believed to possess \"properties of a mystical order\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/stone-age/trepanation/|title=Trepanation - Treatment of the Mentally Ill}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wisNNoceOzoC&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=kidd+1946+trepanation#v=onepage&q=kidd+1946+trepanation&f=false|title=Trepanation|first1=Robert|last1=Arnott|first2=Stanley|last2=Finger|first3=Chris|last3=Smith|date=26 September 2005|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203970942}}</ref>\n\n===Lobotomy===\n\n[[Lobotomy]] was used in the 20th century as a common practice of alternative treatment for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. The first ever modern [[leucotomy]] meant for the purpose of treating a mental illness occurred in 1935 by a Portuguese neurologist, [[Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz|Antonio Egas Moniz]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize]] in medicine in 1949. [https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/03/21/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy/]. This belief that mental health illnesses could be treated by surgery came from Swiss neurologist, [[Gottlieb Burckhardt]]. After conducting experiments on six patients with schizophrenia, he claimed that half of his patients recovered or calmed down.\nPsychiatrist [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] believed that \"an overload of emotions led to mental illness and \u201cthat cutting certain nerves in the brain could eliminate excess emotion and stabilize a personality\", according to a [[National Public Radio]] article.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5014565|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Lobotomies|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\n===Exorcisms===\n\n\"[[Exorcism]] is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, they are believed to have possessed.\"\n\nMental health illnesses such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] (HD), [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[schizophrenia]] were believed to be signs of [[Demonic possession|possession]] by the [[Devil]]. This led to several mentally ill patients being subjected to [[exorcism]]s. This practice has been around for a long time, though decreasing steadily until it reached a low in the 18th century. It seldom occurred until the 20th century when the numbers rose due to the attention the media was giving to exorcisms.

In native healing beliefs, health and mental health were inseparable, so similar combinations of natural and spiritual remedies were often employed to relieve both mental and physical illness.

Rising death tolls due to mental illness demonstrate the imperative need for improved mental health care policies and advances in treatment for Africans suffering from psychological disorders.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nUnderdeveloped African countries are so visibly troubled by physical illnesses, disease, malnutrition, and contamination that the dilemma of lacking mental health care has not been prioritized, makes it challenging to have a recognized impact on the African population. In 1988 and 1990, two original resolutions were implemented by the World Health Organization's Member States in Africa. AFR/RC39/R1 and AFR/RC40/R9 attempted to improve the status of mental health care in specific African regions to combat its growing effects on the African people.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gureje|first=O.|date=2000|title=Mental Health Policy Development in Africa|url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(4)475.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=4|pages=475\u2013482|via=World Health Organization|pmid=10885166|pmc=2560723}}</ref> However, it was found that these new policies had little impact on the status of mental health in Africa, ultimately resulting in an incline in psychological disorders instead of the desired decline, and causing this to seem like an impossible problem to manage.\n\nIn Africa, there are many socio-cultural and biological factors that have led to heightened psychological struggles, while also masking their immediate level of importance to the African eye. Increasing rates of unemployment, violence, crime, rape, and disease are often linked to substance abuse, which can cause mental illness rates to inflate.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2016-march-2017/mental-illness-invisible-devastating|title=Mental illness: Invisible but devastating {{!}} Africa Renewal|website=www.un.org|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Additionally, physical disease like HIV/AIDS, the Ebola epidemic, and malaria often have lasting psychological effects on victims that go unrecognized in African communities because of their inherent cultural beliefs. Traditional African beliefs have led to the perception of mental illness as being caused by supernatural forces, preventing helpful or rational responses to abnormal behavior. For example, Ebola received loads of media attention when it became rampant in Africa and eventually spread to the US, however, researchers never really paid attention to its psychological effects on the African brain. Extreme anxiety, struggles with grief, feelings of rejection and incompetence, depression leading to suicide, PTSD, and much more are only some of the noted effects of diseases like Ebola.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|date=March 2016|title=Ebola's Mental-Health Wounds Linger in Africa|journal=Nature|volume=519|issue=7541|pages=13\u201314|doi=10.1038/519013a|pmid=25739606|id={{ProQuest|1662365135}}}}</ref> These epidemics come and go, but their lasting effects on mental health are remaining for years to come, and even ending lives because of the lack of action. There has been some effort to financially fund psychiatric support in countries like Liberia, due to its dramatic mental health crisis after warfare, but not much was benefited. Aside from financial reasons, it is so difficult to enforce mental health interventions and manage mental health in general in underdeveloped countries simply because the individuals living there do not necessarily believe in western psychiatry. It is also important to note that the socio-cultural model of psychology and abnormal behavior is dependent on factors surrounding cultural differences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Understanding Abnormal Behavior|last=Sue|first=David|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1-305-65851-6|location=Boston, MA|pages=7}}</ref> This causes mental health abnormalities to remain more hidden due to the culture's natural behavior, compared to westernized behavior and cultural norms.\n\nThis relationship between mental and physical illness is an ongoing cycle that has yet to be broken. While there are many organizations attempting to solve problems pertaining to physical health in Africa, as these problems are clearly visible and recognizable, there is little action taken to confront the underlying mental effects that are left on the victims. It is recognized that many of the mentally ill in Africa search for help from spiritual or religious leaders, however this is widely due to the fact that many African countries are significantly lacking in mental health professionals in comparison to the rest of the world.

The ''Lancet Global Health''<ref name=\"Jacob 1061\u20131077\"/> acknowledges that there are well over 1,000 published articles covering physical health in Africa, but there are still less than 50 discussing mental health. And this pressing dilemma of prioritizing physical health vs. mental health is only worsening as the continent's population is substantially growing with research showing that \u201cBetween 2000 and 2015 the continent's population grew by 49%, yet the number of years lost to disability as a result of mental and substance use disorders increased by 52%\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> The number of deaths caused by mental instability is truly competing with those caused by physical diseases: \u201cIn 2015, 17.9 million years were lost to disability as a consequence of mental health problems.

The program stressed the importance of other supports in addition to medical care, including housing, living expenses, employment, transportation, and education; and set up new national priority for people with serious mental disorders. In addition, the Congress enacted the [[Mental Health Systems Act of 1980]] to prioritize the service to the mentally ill and emphasize the expansion of services beyond just clinical care alone.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\">{{citation |last1=Koyanagi |first1=Chris |date=August 2007 |title=Learning From History: Deinstitutionalization of People with Mental Illness As Precursor to Long-Term Care Reform |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] |location=Menlo Park, CA |pages=1\u201322 |url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7684.pdf }}</ref> Later in the 1980s, under the influence from the Congress and the Supreme Court, many programs started to help the patients regain their benefits. A new Medicaid service was also established to serve people who were diagnosed with a \"chronic mental illness.\" People who were temporally hospitalized were also provided aid and care and a pre-release program was created to enable people to apply for reinstatement prior to discharge.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905\"/> Not until 1990, around 35 years after the start of the deinstitutionalization, did the first state hospital begin to close. The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\"/>\n\nHowever, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care. This failure is attributed to a number of reasons over which there is some degree of contention, although there is general agreement that community support programs have been ineffective at best, due to a lack of funding.<ref name=Torrey_Book/>\n\nThe 2011 National Prevention Strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including better parenting and early intervention programs, which increase the likelihood of prevention programs being included in future US mental health policies.<ref name=\":0\">{{citation |author=National Prevention Council |date=16 June 2011 |title=National Prevention Strategy |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General |location=Washington, DC |url=http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004043040/http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 }}</ref>{{page needed |date=January 2016}} The [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] is researching only suicide and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention, but the National Prevention Strategy could lead to it focusing more broadly on longitudinal prevention studies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prevention of Mental Disorders|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=7 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705041918/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml |archive-date=5 July 2015 }}{{Failed verification |reason=Source contains a list of publications.

[[Social skills]], behavioral skills, and someone's way of thinking are just some of the things that the human brain develops at an early age. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn. This starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are some people in society who have difficulty with these kind of skills and behaving like an average person. This is most likely the cause of having a mental illness. A mental illness consist of a wide range of conditions that affects a person's mood, thinking, and behavior. About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though there are many that will develop one, even as early as age three.\n\nThe most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to [[anxiety disorder]], as well as [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]] in older children and teens. Having a mental illness at a younger age is much different from having one in your thirties.

Parents are sometimes held responsible for their child's own illness.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> People also say that the parents raised their children in a certain way or they acquired their behavior from them. Family and friends are sometimes so ashamed of the idea of being close to someone with a disorder that the child feels isolated and thinks that they have to hide their illness from others.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> When in reality, hiding it from people prevents the child from getting the right amount of social interaction and treatment in order to thrive in today's society.\n\n[[Social stigma|Stigma]] is also a well-known factor in mental illness. Stigma is defined as \u201ca mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality, or person.\u201d Stigma is used especially when it comes to the mentally disabled.

This study found that browsing websites related to suicide, and methods used to commit suicide, had a negative effect on suicidal thoughts and increased depression and anxiety tendencies.

In an article written by Lisa Godman and her colleagues, they reference Smith\u2019s research on the prevance of PTSD among homeless people. His research stated \u201c Homelessness itself is a risk factor for emotional disorder\u201d. What this quote is saying is that being homeless itself can cause emotional disorder. Without looking for other reasons for emotional disorder and really looking at the simple fact that an individual is homeless can cause emotional disorder. Godman\u2019s article stated \u201cRecently, Smith ( 1991) investigated the prevalence of PTSD among a sample of 300 randomly selected homeless single women and mothers in St. Louis, Mis- souri. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, 1981; Robins & Helzer, 1984), she found that 53% of the respondents could be diagnosed as exhibiting full-blown cases of PTSD\u201d. As the source explains, the conclusion that was drawn from Smith\u2019s investigation after studying 300 homeless individuals is that 53% of those people were eligible to be diagnosed with PTSD. She continues and states\u201c In addition, data from clinical observations, self-reports, and empirical studies suggest that at least two commonly reported symptoms of psychological trauma, social disaffiliation and learned helplessness are highly prevalent among homeless individuals and families.\u201d Other datas were able to prove that PTSD and learned helplessness were two symptoms that were very much present among homeless individuals and families.

It states \u201cFor homeless people with mental illness, case management linked to other services was effective in improving psychiatric symptoms, and assertive case management was effective in decreasing psychiatric hospitalizations and increasing outpatient contacts. For homeless people with substance abuse problems, case management resulted in greater decreases in substance use than did usual care\u201d. The question would be how are these people being helped.

According to a study on well-being by Richards, Campania and Muse-Burke, \"[[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] is considered to be a purposeful state, it may be that those who practice it believe in its importance and value being mindful, so that valuing of self-care activities may influence the intentional component of mindfulness.\"<ref name=\"Richards 2010 247\"/>\n\n===Care navigation===\n{{main|Mental health care navigator}} \nMental health care navigation helps to guide patients and families through the fragmented, often confusing mental health industries. Care navigators work closely with patients and families through discussion and collaboration to provide information on best therapies as well as referrals to practitioners and facilities specializing in particular forms of emotional improvement. The difference between therapy and care navigation is that the care navigation process provides information and directs patients to therapy rather than providing therapy. Still, care navigators may offer diagnosis and treatment planning. Though many care navigators are also trained therapists and doctors. Care navigation is the link between the patient and the below therapies. A clear recognition that mental health requires medical intervention was demonstrated in a study by Kessler et al. of the prevalence and treatment of mental disorders from 1990 to 2003 in the United States. Despite the prevalence of mental health disorders remaining unchanged during this period, the number of patients seeking treatment for mental disorders increased threefold.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kessler|first1=Ronald C. |last2=Demler|first2=Olga |last3=Frank|first3=Richard G. |last4=Olfson|first4=Mark |last5=Pincus|first5=Harold Alan |last6=Walters|first6=Ellen E. |last7=Wang|first7=Philip |last8=Wells|first8=Kenneth B. |last9=Zaslavsky|first9=Alan M. |title=Prevalence and Treatment of Mental Disorders, 1990 to 2003 |date=16 June 2005 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |issue=24 |pages=2515\u20132523 |doi= 10.1056/nejmsa043266|pmid=15958807 |pmc=2847367 }}</ref>\n\n==Emotional issues==\n[[File:The prevalence of mental illness is higher in more unequal rich countries.jpg|thumb|The prevalence of mental illness is higher in more [[economic inequality|unequal]] rich countries|alt=|left]]Emotional mental disorders are a leading cause of disabilities worldwide.

Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, \"even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints\".\n\nThe World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. \n\"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet needs for treatment. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care.\"\n\nKnowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa ([[Nigeria]], South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific ([[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with [[World Bank]] criteria as [[Low income|low-income]] ([[Nigeria]]), lower middle-income ([[China]], [[Colombia]], [[South Africa]], [[Ukraine]]), higher middle-income ([[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]]), and high-income.\n\nThe coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that \"the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of [[gross domestic product]] spent on health care\".\n\"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since [[WHO]] Project [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in [[low-income]] and [[middle-income]] countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually <1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill-equipped for it\".\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Older methods of treatment===\n\n=== Trepanation ===\n\nArchaeological records have shown that [[trepanation]] was a procedure used to treat \"headaches, insanities or [[epilepsy]]\" in several parts of the world in the Stone age. It was a surgical process used in the [[Stone Age]]. [[Paul Broca]] studied trepanation and came up with his own theory on it. He noticed that the fractures on the skulls dug up weren't caused by wounds inflicted due to violence, but because of careful surgical procedures. \"Doctors used sharpened stones to scrape the skull and drill holes into the head of the patient\" to allow evil spirits which plagued the patient to escape. There were several patients that died in these procedures, but those that survived were revered and believed to possess \"properties of a mystical order\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/stone-age/trepanation/|title=Trepanation - Treatment of the Mentally Ill}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wisNNoceOzoC&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=kidd+1946+trepanation#v=onepage&q=kidd+1946+trepanation&f=false|title=Trepanation|first1=Robert|last1=Arnott|first2=Stanley|last2=Finger|first3=Chris|last3=Smith|date=26 September 2005|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203970942}}</ref>\n\n===Lobotomy===\n\n[[Lobotomy]] was used in the 20th century as a common practice of alternative treatment for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. The first ever modern [[leucotomy]] meant for the purpose of treating a mental illness occurred in 1935 by a Portuguese neurologist, [[Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz|Antonio Egas Moniz]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize]] in medicine in 1949. [https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/03/21/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy/]. This belief that mental health illnesses could be treated by surgery came from Swiss neurologist, [[Gottlieb Burckhardt]]. After conducting experiments on six patients with schizophrenia, he claimed that half of his patients recovered or calmed down.\nPsychiatrist [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] believed that \"an overload of emotions led to mental illness and \u201cthat cutting certain nerves in the brain could eliminate excess emotion and stabilize a personality\", according to a [[National Public Radio]] article.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5014565|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Lobotomies|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\n===Exorcisms===\n\n\"[[Exorcism]] is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, they are believed to have possessed.\"\n\nMental health illnesses such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] (HD), [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[schizophrenia]] were believed to be signs of [[Demonic possession|possession]] by the [[Devil]]. This led to several mentally ill patients being subjected to [[exorcism]]s. This practice has been around for a long time, though decreasing steadily until it reached a low in the 18th century. It seldom occurred until the 20th century when the numbers rose due to the attention the media was giving to exorcisms.

In native healing beliefs, health and mental health were inseparable, so similar combinations of natural and spiritual remedies were often employed to relieve both mental and physical illness. These communities and families greatly valued holistic approaches for preventive health care.

One million people commit suicide every year and 10 to 20 million attempt it.<ref>Sowers, Rowe, & Clay, 2009{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Africa ===\nMental illnesses and mental health disorders are widespread concerns among underdeveloped African countries, yet these issues are largely neglected, as mental health care in Africa is given statistically less attention than it is in other, westernized nations. Rising death tolls due to mental illness demonstrate the imperative need for improved mental health care policies and advances in treatment for Africans suffering from psychological disorders.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nUnderdeveloped African countries are so visibly troubled by physical illnesses, disease, malnutrition, and contamination that the dilemma of lacking mental health care has not been prioritized, makes it challenging to have a recognized impact on the African population. In 1988 and 1990, two original resolutions were implemented by the World Health Organization's Member States in Africa. AFR/RC39/R1 and AFR/RC40/R9 attempted to improve the status of mental health care in specific African regions to combat its growing effects on the African people.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gureje|first=O.|date=2000|title=Mental Health Policy Development in Africa|url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(4)475.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=4|pages=475\u2013482|via=World Health Organization|pmid=10885166|pmc=2560723}}</ref> However, it was found that these new policies had little impact on the status of mental health in Africa, ultimately resulting in an incline in psychological disorders instead of the desired decline, and causing this to seem like an impossible problem to manage.\n\nIn Africa, there are many socio-cultural and biological factors that have led to heightened psychological struggles, while also masking their immediate level of importance to the African eye. Increasing rates of unemployment, violence, crime, rape, and disease are often linked to substance abuse, which can cause mental illness rates to inflate.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2016-march-2017/mental-illness-invisible-devastating|title=Mental illness: Invisible but devastating {{!}} Africa Renewal|website=www.un.org|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Additionally, physical disease like HIV/AIDS, the Ebola epidemic, and malaria often have lasting psychological effects on victims that go unrecognized in African communities because of their inherent cultural beliefs. Traditional African beliefs have led to the perception of mental illness as being caused by supernatural forces, preventing helpful or rational responses to abnormal behavior. For example, Ebola received loads of media attention when it became rampant in Africa and eventually spread to the US, however, researchers never really paid attention to its psychological effects on the African brain. Extreme anxiety, struggles with grief, feelings of rejection and incompetence, depression leading to suicide, PTSD, and much more are only some of the noted effects of diseases like Ebola.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|date=March 2016|title=Ebola's Mental-Health Wounds Linger in Africa|journal=Nature|volume=519|issue=7541|pages=13\u201314|doi=10.1038/519013a|pmid=25739606|id={{ProQuest|1662365135}}}}</ref> These epidemics come and go, but their lasting effects on mental health are remaining for years to come, and even ending lives because of the lack of action. There has been some effort to financially fund psychiatric support in countries like Liberia, due to its dramatic mental health crisis after warfare, but not much was benefited. Aside from financial reasons, it is so difficult to enforce mental health interventions and manage mental health in general in underdeveloped countries simply because the individuals living there do not necessarily believe in western psychiatry. It is also important to note that the socio-cultural model of psychology and abnormal behavior is dependent on factors surrounding cultural differences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Understanding Abnormal Behavior|last=Sue|first=David|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1-305-65851-6|location=Boston, MA|pages=7}}</ref> This causes mental health abnormalities to remain more hidden due to the culture's natural behavior, compared to westernized behavior and cultural norms.\n\nThis relationship between mental and physical illness is an ongoing cycle that has yet to be broken. While there are many organizations attempting to solve problems pertaining to physical health in Africa, as these problems are clearly visible and recognizable, there is little action taken to confront the underlying mental effects that are left on the victims. It is recognized that many of the mentally ill in Africa search for help from spiritual or religious leaders, however this is widely due to the fact that many African countries are significantly lacking in mental health professionals in comparison to the rest of the world. In Ethiopia alone, there are \u201conly 10 psychiatrists for the population of 61 million people,\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> studies have shown. While numbers have definitely changed since this research was done, the lack of psychological professionals throughout African continues with a current average of 1.4 mental health workers per 100,000 people compared to the global statistic of 9.0 professionals per 100,00 people.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal |last1=Sankoh |first1=Osman |last2=Sevalie |first2=Stephen |last3=Weston |first3=Mark |title=Mental health in Africa |journal=The Lancet Global Health |date=September 2018 |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=e954\u2013e955 |doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30303-6 |pmid=30103990 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Additionally, statistics show that the \u201cglobal annual rate of visits to mental health outpatient facilities is 1,051 per 100,000 population,\u201d while \u201cin Africa the rate is 14 per 100,000\u201d visits.

The ''Lancet Global Health''<ref name=\"Jacob 1061\u20131077\"/> acknowledges that there are well over 1,000 published articles covering physical health in Africa, but there are still less than 50 discussing mental health. And this pressing dilemma of prioritizing physical health vs. mental health is only worsening as the continent's population is substantially growing with research showing that \u201cBetween 2000 and 2015 the continent's population grew by 49%, yet the number of years lost to disability as a result of mental and substance use disorders increased by 52%\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> The number of deaths caused by mental instability is truly competing with those caused by physical diseases: \u201cIn 2015, 17.9 million years were lost to disability as a consequence of mental health problems.

As new challenges surface and old challenges still haven't been prioritized, Africa's mental health care policies need significant improvement in order to provide its people with the appropriate health care they deserve, hopefully preventing this problem from expanding.\n\n===Australia===\nA survey conducted by [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] in 2008 regarding adults with manageable to severe neurosis reveals almost half of the population had a mental disorder at some point of their life and one in five people had a sustained disorder in the preceding 12 months. In neurotic disorders, 14% of the population experienced anxiety and comorbidity disorders were next to common mental disorder with vulnerability to substance abuse and relapses. There were distinct gender differences in disposition to mental health illness. Women were found to have high rate of mental health disorders, and Men had higher propensity of risk for substance abuse. The SMHWB survey showed families that had low socioeconomic status and high dysfunctional patterns had a greater proportional risk for mental health disorders. A 2010 survey regarding adults with psychosis revealed 5 persons per 1000 in the population seeks professional mental health services for [[psychotic disorders]] and the most common psychotic disorder was [[schizophrenia]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ruth Elder|author2=Katie Evans|author3=Debra Nizette|title=Psychiatric & Mental Health Nursing|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jpnzp7D64XcC|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-7295-8098-4|chapter=Mental Health and Illness in Australia and New Zealand}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Mental health services and the integration of employment support in Australia|year=2015|issn=2225-7977|doi=10.1787/9789264246591-en|series=Mental Health and Work|isbn=9789264246584}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nAccording to statistics released by the Centre of Addiction and Mental Health one in five people in [[Canada]] experience a mental health or addiction problem.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Mental Health Commission of Canada Releases Guidelines for Comprehensive Mental Health Services for Older Adults in Canada|date=2011|doi = 10.1037/e505332013-001}}</ref> Young people ages 15 to 25 are particularly vulnerable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Major depression is found to affect 8% and anxiety disorder 12% of the population.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Women are 1.5 times more likely to suffer from mood and anxiety disorders.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} WHO points out that there are distinct gender differences in patterns of mental health and illness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/gender/other_health/genderMH.pdf|title=Gender and Mental Health|last=|first=|date=June 2002|website=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The lack of power and control over their socioeconomic status, gender based violence; low social position and responsibility for the care of others render women vulnerable to mental health risks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Since more women than men seek help regarding a mental health problem, this has led to not only gender stereotyping but also reinforcing social stigma.

The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\"/>\n\nHowever, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care. This failure is attributed to a number of reasons over which there is some degree of contention, although there is general agreement that community support programs have been ineffective at best, due to a lack of funding.<ref name=Torrey_Book/>\n\nThe 2011 National Prevention Strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including better parenting and early intervention programs, which increase the likelihood of prevention programs being included in future US mental health policies.<ref name=\":0\">{{citation |author=National Prevention Council |date=16 June 2011 |title=National Prevention Strategy |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General |location=Washington, DC |url=http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004043040/http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 }}</ref>{{page needed |date=January 2016}} The [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] is researching only suicide and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention, but the National Prevention Strategy could lead to it focusing more broadly on longitudinal prevention studies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prevention of Mental Disorders|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=7 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705041918/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml |archive-date=5 July 2015 }}{{Failed verification |reason=Source contains a list of publications.

As of 2020, Tilden is the only individual to [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|win an outright majority of the popular vote]] in a [[United States presidential election]] but lose the election.{{efn|As of 2020, four candidates have lost a presidential election despite garnering a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular vote; [[Andrew Jackson]] in [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]]; [[Grover Cleveland]] in [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]]; [[Al Gore]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]; and [[Hillary Clinton]] in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]].}} \n\nTilden was born into a wealthy family in [[New Lebanon, New York]]. Attracted to politics at a young age, he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Martin Van Buren]], the eighth [[President of the United States]]. After studying at [[Yale University]] and [[New York University School of Law]], Tilden began a legal career in [[New York City]], becoming a noted corporate lawyer. He served in the [[New York State Assembly]] and helped launch Van Buren's [[third party (United States)|third party]], anti-[[slavery in the United States|slavery]] candidacy in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]]. Though he opposed the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860, Tilden supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]]. After the Civil War, Tilden was selected as the chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]], and he managed Democratic nominee [[Horatio Seymour]]'s campaign in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]]. \n\nTilden initially cooperated with the state party's [[Tammany Hall]] faction, but he broke with them in 1871 due to boss [[William M. Tweed]]'s rampant corruption. Tilden won election as [[Governor of New York]] in 1874, and in that office he helped break up the \"[[Canal Ring (New York)|Canal Ring]].\" Tilden's battle against public corruption, along with his personal fortune and electoral success in the country's most populous state, made him the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 1876. Tilden was selected as the nominee on the second ballot of the [[1876 Democratic National Convention]]. In the general election, Tilden faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], another governor with reform credentials. Tilden focused his campaign on civil service reform, support for the [[gold standard]], and opposition to high taxes, but many of his supporters were more concerned with ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] in the South.\n\nMost observers initially believed that Tilden had won the election, but disputes in four states left both Tilden and Hayes without a majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]. As Tilden had won 184 electoral votes, one vote shy of a majority, a Hayes victory required that he sweep all of the disputed electoral votes. Against Tilden's wishes, Congress appointed the bipartisan [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the controversy. Republicans had a one-seat advantage on the Electoral Commission, and in a series of party-line rulings, ruled that Hayes had won all of the disputed electoral votes. In the [[Compromise of 1877]], Democratic leaders agreed to accept Hayes as the victor in return for the end of Reconstruction. Tilden was a major contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]] and [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 presidential elections]], but declined to run.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[Image:SamuelJTilden.jpeg|thumb|Samuel Tilden as a young man]]\n\nTilden was born in [[New Lebanon, New York]], the youngest son of Elam Tilden and Polly Jones Tilden.<ref>Bigelow (2009), pp. 12\u201315</ref> He was descended from [[Tylden (family)|Nathaniel Tilden]], an early [[English people|English]] settler who came to [[North America]] in 1634. His father and other family members were the makers of [[Tilden's Extract]], a popular [[patent medicine]] of the 1800s and early 1900s derived from [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref>William Lee Richter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cyGb-eMnmXkC&pg=PA610 ''Historical Dictionary of the Civil War and Reconstruction''], 2004, page 610</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=psbmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA117 Obituary, Samuel J.

Like other Barnburners, Tilden sought to prevent the spread of slavery into the [[Mexican cession|land acquired from Mexico]] in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. He helped organize the 1848 [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] Convention, which nominated Van Buren for president. Van Buren's candidacy in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]] may have played a role in the victory of Whig nominee [[Zachary Taylor]] over Democratic nominee [[Lewis Cass]]. Unlike many other anti-slavery Democrats, Tilden did not join the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the 1850s, but he did not have close relations with Democratic presidents [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[James Buchanan]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 94\u201395</ref> In [[New York state election, 1855|1855]], Tilden was the unsuccessful [[New York State Attorney General|state attorney general]] candidate of the \"[[Hunkers and Barnburners|Soft]]\" faction of Barnburners, which favored compromise and reconciliation with the Democratic Party.<ref>Robinson (2001), p. 85</ref> In [[New York state election, 1859|1859]], after he lost an election to serve as New York City's corporation counsel, Tilden announced that he was \"out of politics.\"<ref>Morris (2003), p. 95</ref>\n\nIn the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], Tilden strongly opposed the candidacy of Republican presidential nominee [[Abraham Lincoln]]. He warned that the election of Lincoln could lead to the secession of the South and a subsequent civil war.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 95\u201396</ref> Tilden initially opposed using force to prevent secession, but he supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] after the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. Tilden served as the manager of [[Horatio Seymour]]'s successful 1862 campaign for governor, and played a key role in securing the nomination of [[George B. McClellan]] at the [[1864 Democratic National Convention]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 96\u201397</ref>\n\nIn 1867, Tilden received the [[honorary degree]] of [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]] from [[New York University]].<ref>{{cite book |last=General Alumni Society, New York University |date=1906 |title=General Alumni Catalogue |url=https://archive.org/details/generalalumnica01univgoog |location=New York, NY |publisher=New York University |page=170}}</ref> He was also chosen as a delegate to that year's [[New York Constitution#Constitutional Convention of 1867\u20131868|state constitutional convention]].<ref>{{cite news |date=June 4, 1867 |title=The Constitutional Convention to Assemble To-Day |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/329585675/ |work=[[New York Herald]] |location=New York, NY |url-access=subscription |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |page=7}}</ref>\n\n== State party leader ==\n[[File:SamuelTilden.png|thumb|right|upright|A portrait of Samuel Jones Tilden]]\n\nFollowing the end of the Civil War, Tilden won election as the chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]]. He served as Seymour's campaign chairman in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]], but Seymour lost the election to Republican nominee [[Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 97\u201398</ref> After the election, Tilden broke with [[William M. Tweed]], the leader of the [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]]. Through bribery, patronage, and control of [[Irish-American]] voters, Tweed and his allies had become the dominant power in both New York City and the state of New York.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 99\u2013102</ref> In 1871, former Tammany associate [[James O'Brien (U.S. Congressman)|James O'Brien]] leaked Tweed's account books to the ''[[New York Times]]''. The ''Times'' subsequently began a public crusade against Tammany Hall, and Tilden launched an investigation into Tweed's bank records. Tilden ran for the New York State Assembly as part of a slate of anti-Tammany Democrats; at the state party convention, he declared that it was \"time to proclaim that whoever plunders the people, though he steal the livery of heaven to serve the devil in, is no Democrat.\" The anti-Tammany Democrats, including Tilden, won a major victory in the [[New York state election, 1871|1871 state elections]], and Tweed was indicted on 120 counts of fraud and other violations. After the election, Tweed fled the state, but he was eventually extradited back to New York, where he died in prison in 1878.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nTilden's role in taking down Tweed bolstered his popularity, and he was elected Governor of New York in [[New York state election, 1874|1874]]. As governor, he continued to focus on rooting out corruption. He helped to break up the \"[[Canal Ring (New York)|Canal Ring]],\" a bipartisan group of state and local officials who had enriched themselves by overcharging for the maintenance of the [[New York State Canal System]]. Tilden gained a national reputation as a reform governor, a valuable asset given the number of [[Grant administration scandals|scandals]] that had come into public view during the [[presidency of Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nIn 1875, Tilden received an honorary LL.D. from [[Yale University]].<ref name=Yale_Catalogue>{{cite book |last=Yale University |date=1877 |title=Catalogue of the Officers and Graduates of Yale University |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=UahGAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA51 |location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Morehouse and Taylor |page=51}}</ref> At the same time, Yale also enrolled him as a graduate of the Class of 1837 and he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree.<ref name=\"Yale_Catalogue\"/>\n\n==Presidential election of 1876==\n{{See also|Samuel Tilden presidential campaign, 1876}}\n\n===Democratic nomination===\n[[Image:Tilden and Hendricks campaign poster.jpg|thumb|Campaign poster for the election of 1876]]\n\nBy the time of the June [[1876 Democratic National Convention]], Tilden had emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 106</ref> Tilden's appeal to the national party was based on his reputation for reform and his electoral success in the country's most populous state. He was also a skilled organizer whose canvassing system and field knowledge was so thorough that, months before the 1874 election, he'd predicted his own winning margin accurately to within 300 votes.<ref>Holt (2008), p. 100</ref> Tilden further bolstered his presidential candidacy through a nationwide newspaper advertising campaign. As many Democrats expected that their party would win the 1876 presidential elections, Tilden faced competition from some of the party's most prominent leaders, including [[Thomas F. Bayard]], [[Allen G. Thurman]], [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], and General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nDuring the difficult economic times of the [[Panic of 1873]], the major ideological divide in the Democratic Party concerned the issue of [[History of monetary policy in the United States|currency]]. Many \"soft money\" Democrats wanted Congress to repeal the [[Specie Payment Resumption Act]] and authorize the printing of more [[greenback (money)|greenback]]s, [[banknotes]] that had first been printed during the Civil War. The printing of more greenbacks would result in [[inflation]] and potentially benefit farmers by raising prices and helping them pay down their debts. Like most Republicans and \"hard money\" members of the conservative business establishment, Tilden believed that the termination of greenback circulation (which would return the country to the [[gold standard]]) was the best way to solve the ongoing economic crisis. Tilden's lieutenants at the Democratic National Convention emphasized Tilden's reform credentials above all else, but they also ensured that the party platform endorsed Tilden's hard money views.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 108\u2013109, 112\u2013114</ref> \n\nTilden won a majority of the votes cast on the first presidential ballot of the convention, but fell short of the two-thirds majority required to win the Democratic presidential nomination. His closest rival was Hendricks, who had the support of New York party boss [[John Kelly (New York politician)|John Kelly]] and the soft money faction of Democrats. Tilden won the necessary two-thirds majority on the second presidential ballot, and the convention then voted to make his nomination unanimous. Delegates unanimously chose Hendricks as Tilden's running mate, providing a balance between the hard money and soft money factions.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 115\u2013117</ref> Though the Republicans had nominated a ticket led by [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] of Ohio, another governor who had established a reputation for honest governance, Tilden was widely regarded as the favorite in the general election.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 80\u201383, 122</ref>\n\n===General election===\n[[File:1876 U.S. presidential election, contested states.png|thumb|upright=1.5|In the aftermath of the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]], the electoral votes of four states were disputed.]]\n\nPer tradition, both Tilden and Hayes avoided publicly campaigning for president, leaving that task to their supporters; Tilden appointed [[Abram Hewitt]] to lead his campaign.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 123, 131\u2013132</ref> The Republican campaign established a major cash advantage, partly because Tilden refused to contribute much of his personal fortune to the campaign.<ref>Morris (2003), p. 121</ref> The Democrats campaigned on the theme of \"retrenchment and reform\" and attacked the \"corrupt centralism\" of the Grant administration.<ref name=\"morris118120\"/> Tilden blamed high taxes and the Grant administration for the economic downturn, and, like Hayes, promised [[U.S. Civil Service Reform|civil service reform]] and hard money policies.<ref>White (2017), pp. 328\u2013330</ref> Republicans, meanwhile, focused on their party's identification with Lincoln and the Union cause in the Civil War; many Republicans still associated the Democratic Party with slavery and disunion.<ref name=\"morris118120\">Morris (2003), pp. 118\u2013120</ref> Rebutting Republican charges, Tilden categorically denied that he had any intention of compensating the South for any slaves emancipated or losses suffered during the Civil War.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 161\u2013162</ref> For their part, many Democrats cared little for Tilden's emphasis on reform, and were instead focused on ending sixteen years of Republican leadership. Southern Democrats especially hoped to end [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and gain control of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana, the last three \"[[Redeemers|unredeemed]]\" Southern states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 125\u2013126, 146</ref> Southern whites, who overwhelmingly favored Tilden, used violence and intimidation to suppress the turnout of Republican-leaning [[African-American]] voters.<ref>White (2017), pp. 330\u2013331</ref> Tilden worked to distance himself from violent encounters like the [[Hamburg massacre]], in which disgruntled Southern whites clashed with the Republican-led government of South Carolina.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 129\u2013131</ref>\n\nBoth campaigns considered New York, Ohio, and Indiana to be the key [[swing states]], but the campaigns also focused on several smaller states, including the three unredeemed Southern states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 155\u2013156</ref> Ultimately, Hayes swept the West and won much of the North, but Tilden carried the closely contested Northern states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut, swept the [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]], and carried most of the South. He had won a majority of the popular vote and tallied clear victories in seventeen states, leaving him one [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]] short of a majority. On November 6, the day after election day, most major newspapers reported that Tilden had won the election; however, Hayes still had a narrow path to victory if he could sweep the electoral votes of Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 164\u2013166</ref> Hayes refused to formally concede, but told members of the press that he was \"of the opinion that the Democrats have carried the country and elected Tilden.\"<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 167\u2013171</ref> Tilden, meanwhile, urged his alarmed followers, many of whom believed that the Republicans were attempting to steal the election, to remain calm and refrain from violence. Both parties feared the possibility that a dispute over the election would lead to armed conflict; Tilden discussed appointing General [[George B. McClellan]] as his military assistant, while President Grant ordered army and naval units to reinforce Washington.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 172\u2013174</ref>\n\n===Post-election controversy===\n[[Image:SJTilden of NY.jpg|thumb|right|Samuel Jones Tilden]]\n\nWith the election in doubt, each party sent some of their most prominent leaders to monitor the election process in the three disputed Southern states. Initial election returns showed that Hayes had carried South Carolina by several hundred votes, but that Tilden had won Florida by 91 votes and Louisiana by over 6000 votes.

Meanwhile, another controversy had arisen in Oregon, where a Hayes elector, John Watts, resigned because his simultaneous service as a presidential elector and as a low-ranking official in the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] violated the [[United States Constitution]]. After Watts resigned, the state's Democratic governor appointed an elector to fill the vacancy, while, separately, the state's two remaining Hayes electors chose a third elector to fill the vacancy caused by Watts's resignation.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 183\u2013185, 197\u2013198</ref>\n\nOn December 6, the members of the Electoral College met in Washington, D.C., but the disputes in four states prevented a conclusive vote for president.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 197\u2013198</ref> With the Electoral College unable to select a president, the disputed election became an issue for Congress to settle; Republicans controlled the Senate, while Democrats controlled the House. The vague wording of the Constitution gave rise to further controversy, as Republicans held that [[Thomas W. Ferry]], a Republican senator from Michigan and the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]] of the [[United States Senate]], could determine the validity of the disputed electoral votes. Democrats argued that Ferry could only count the votes that were not disputed; in such a scenario, neither candidate would have an electoral vote majority, necessitating a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Since Democrats controlled a majority of the state delegations in the House, they would be able to elect Tilden as president in a contingent election.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 200\u2013201</ref> In response to the controversy, Tilden compiled his own study of electoral procedures in the previous 22 presidential elections. He delivered the study to every sitting member of Congress, but congressional Republicans were not swayed by Tilden's argument that history supported the Democratic position on the election returns.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 203\u2013204</ref> He continued to call for calm, and rejected Abram Hewitt's suggestion that he ask his supporters to engage in mass public demonstrations.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 206\u2013207, 214</ref>\n\n===Electoral Commission===\n[[File:President Rutherford Hayes 1870 - 1880 Restored.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Rutherford B. Hayes]] defeated Tilden in the 1876 election.]]\n\nOn January 26, both houses of Congress agreed to establish the 15-member [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the dispute over the contested electoral votes. The commission consisted of five Democratic members of Congress, five Republican members of Congress, and five justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Of the Supreme Court justices, two were to be Democrats, two were to be Republicans, and the fifth justice would be selected by the other four justices. Tilden opposed the creation of the Electoral Commission because he still hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives, but he was unable to prevent Democratic congressmen from voting for the establishment of the commission. Most had expected that the fifth justice on the commission would be Associate Justice [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], a [[political independent]], but Davis refused to serve on the commission after he accepted election to the Senate. Another associate justice, Republican [[Joseph P. Bradley]], was instead chosen as the fifth justice on the Electoral Commission.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 216\u2013219</ref> In a series of 8-to-7, party-line decisions, the Electoral Commission voted to award all of the contested electoral votes to Hayes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 222\u2013235</ref>\n\nEven after the Electoral Commission delivered its rulings, the House of Representatives could have blocked the inauguration of Hayes by refusing to certify the election results.<ref>White (2017), p. 332</ref> Though some House Democrats hoped to do just that, they were unable to prevent the House of Representatives from blocking certification, as many House Democrats joined with their Republican colleagues in accepting the results.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 235\u2013236</ref> During the proceedings of the Electoral Commission, high-ranking members of both parties had discussed the possibility of declaring Hayes the winner in exchange for the removal of all federal troops from the South. The [[Compromise of 1877]], as it became known, may have played a role in preventing the House from challenging the Electoral Commission's rulings, although author Roy Morris, Jr. argues that the compromise \"was more a mutual concession of the obvious than a device for controlling larger events.\"<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 232\u2013234</ref> Some other historians, including [[C. Vann Woodward]], have argued that the Compromise of 1877 played the decisive role in determining the outcome of the election.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kleinfeld |first1=N.

Potter was appointed as the head of the commission, which Democrats hoped would implicate Hayes and damage the Republican Party in the next presidential election.<ref>Guenther (1983), 284\u2013285</ref> Rather than produce conclusive evidence of Republican malfeasance, the committee uncovered conflicting evidence that reflected poorly on election and campaign officials of both parties. For ten months beginning in May 1878, the Potter Committee subpoenaed all telegrams sent by political operatives during the election dispute. 29,275 telegrams had been sent, but all save 641 had been routinely destroyed by [[Western Union]]. The remaining telegrams were in cipher, as was common with business and political communication in the telegraph era. ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' editor [[Whitelaw Reid]] obtained and deciphered many of the telegrams and, in October 1878, he published the story of the Democratic efforts to sway election officials through bribery and other means. The revelation of the bribery attempts undercut the Democratic Party's argument that Tilden had been cheated out of the presidency.<ref>Kahn (1996), pp. 221\u2013229</ref> Tilden was not implicated in any wrongdoing, but the investigation into the Cipher Telegrams damaged his national standing.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 250\u2013251</ref>\n\n===Election of 1880===\n\nAfter the controversy over the election of 1876, Tilden became the presumptive Democratic candidate in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 presidential election]]. He declined to run for another term as governor in 1879, focusing instead on building support for the 1880 presidential nomination.<ref>Clancy (1958), p. 52</ref> The revelations of the Potter Committee, along with Tilden's persistent health issues, both damaged Tilden's national standing, but his superior political organization and personal fortune ensured that he remained a serious contender for the Democratic nomination.<ref>Clancy (1958), pp. 56\u201357</ref> Tilden's standing with the party slipped further following the Republican victory in the [[New York state election, 1879|New York gubernatorial election in 1879]]. In that election, a revitalized Tammany Hall organization split from the regular Democratic party in a patronage dispute with Tilden's faction.<ref>Clancy (1958), pp. 61\u201363</ref> In the months before the [[1880 Democratic National Convention]], rumors about Tilden's intentions circulated wildly, but Tilden refused to definitively state whether or not he would seek the Democratic nomination.<ref>Clancy (1958), pp. 74\u201375</ref>\n\nAs the New York delegation left for the national convention in Cincinnati, Tilden gave a letter to one of his chief supporters, [[Daniel Manning]], suggesting that his health might force him to decline the nomination.<ref>Clancy (1958), pp. 122\u2013123</ref> Tilden hoped to be nominated, but only if he was the unanimous choice of the convention; if not, Manning was entrusted to make the contents of Tilden's letter available to the New York delegation.<ref name=\"Goldman\">{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Andrew |date=2015 |orig-year=1990 |title=The National Party Chairmen and Committees |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0agDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT107 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Routledge |page=107 |isbn=978-1-3154-9067-0}}</ref> The New York delegation interpreted the letter as a notice of withdrawal, and the delegates began looking for a new candidate, eventually settling on Speaker of the House [[Samuel J.

As of 2020, Tilden is the only individual to [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|win an outright majority of the popular vote]] in a [[United States presidential election]] but lose the election.{{efn|As of 2020, four candidates have lost a presidential election despite garnering a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular vote; [[Andrew Jackson]] in [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]]; [[Grover Cleveland]] in [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]]; [[Al Gore]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]; and [[Hillary Clinton]] in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]].}} \n\nTilden was born into a wealthy family in [[New Lebanon, New York]]. Attracted to politics at a young age, he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Martin Van Buren]], the eighth [[President of the United States]]. After studying at [[Yale University]] and [[New York University School of Law]], Tilden began a legal career in [[New York City]], becoming a noted corporate lawyer. He served in the [[New York State Assembly]] and helped launch Van Buren's [[third party (United States)|third party]], anti-[[slavery in the United States|slavery]] candidacy in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]]. Though he opposed the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860, Tilden supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]]. After the Civil War, Tilden was selected as the chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]], and he managed Democratic nominee [[Horatio Seymour]]'s campaign in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]]. \n\nTilden initially cooperated with the state party's [[Tammany Hall]] faction, but he broke with them in 1871 due to boss [[William M. Tweed]]'s rampant corruption. Tilden won election as [[Governor of New York]] in 1874, and in that office he helped break up the \"[[Canal Ring (New York)|Canal Ring]].\" Tilden's battle against public corruption, along with his personal fortune and electoral success in the country's most populous state, made him the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 1876. Tilden was selected as the nominee on the second ballot of the [[1876 Democratic National Convention]]. In the general election, Tilden faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], another governor with reform credentials. Tilden focused his campaign on civil service reform, support for the [[gold standard]], and opposition to high taxes, but many of his supporters were more concerned with ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] in the South.\n\nMost observers initially believed that Tilden had won the election, but disputes in four states left both Tilden and Hayes without a majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]. As Tilden had won 184 electoral votes, one vote shy of a majority, a Hayes victory required that he sweep all of the disputed electoral votes. Against Tilden's wishes, Congress appointed the bipartisan [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the controversy. Republicans had a one-seat advantage on the Electoral Commission, and in a series of party-line rulings, ruled that Hayes had won all of the disputed electoral votes. In the [[Compromise of 1877]], Democratic leaders agreed to accept Hayes as the victor in return for the end of Reconstruction. Tilden was a major contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]] and [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 presidential elections]], but declined to run.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[Image:SamuelJTilden.jpeg|thumb|Samuel Tilden as a young man]]\n\nTilden was born in [[New Lebanon, New York]], the youngest son of Elam Tilden and Polly Jones Tilden.<ref>Bigelow (2009), pp. 12\u201315</ref> He was descended from [[Tylden (family)|Nathaniel Tilden]], an early [[English people|English]] settler who came to [[North America]] in 1634.

Like other Barnburners, Tilden sought to prevent the spread of slavery into the [[Mexican cession|land acquired from Mexico]] in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. He helped organize the 1848 [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] Convention, which nominated Van Buren for president. Van Buren's candidacy in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]] may have played a role in the victory of Whig nominee [[Zachary Taylor]] over Democratic nominee [[Lewis Cass]]. Unlike many other anti-slavery Democrats, Tilden did not join the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the 1850s, but he did not have close relations with Democratic presidents [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[James Buchanan]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 94\u201395</ref> In [[New York state election, 1855|1855]], Tilden was the unsuccessful [[New York State Attorney General|state attorney general]] candidate of the \"[[Hunkers and Barnburners|Soft]]\" faction of Barnburners, which favored compromise and reconciliation with the Democratic Party.<ref>Robinson (2001), p. 85</ref> In [[New York state election, 1859|1859]], after he lost an election to serve as New York City's corporation counsel, Tilden announced that he was \"out of politics.\"<ref>Morris (2003), p. 95</ref>\n\nIn the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], Tilden strongly opposed the candidacy of Republican presidential nominee [[Abraham Lincoln]]. He warned that the election of Lincoln could lead to the secession of the South and a subsequent civil war.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 95\u201396</ref> Tilden initially opposed using force to prevent secession, but he supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] after the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]].

He served as Seymour's campaign chairman in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]], but Seymour lost the election to Republican nominee [[Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 97\u201398</ref> After the election, Tilden broke with [[William M. Tweed]], the leader of the [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]]. Through bribery, patronage, and control of [[Irish-American]] voters, Tweed and his allies had become the dominant power in both New York City and the state of New York.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 99\u2013102</ref> In 1871, former Tammany associate [[James O'Brien (U.S. Congressman)|James O'Brien]] leaked Tweed's account books to the ''[[New York Times]]''. The ''Times'' subsequently began a public crusade against Tammany Hall, and Tilden launched an investigation into Tweed's bank records. Tilden ran for the New York State Assembly as part of a slate of anti-Tammany Democrats; at the state party convention, he declared that it was \"time to proclaim that whoever plunders the people, though he steal the livery of heaven to serve the devil in, is no Democrat.\" The anti-Tammany Democrats, including Tilden, won a major victory in the [[New York state election, 1871|1871 state elections]], and Tweed was indicted on 120 counts of fraud and other violations. After the election, Tweed fled the state, but he was eventually extradited back to New York, where he died in prison in 1878.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nTilden's role in taking down Tweed bolstered his popularity, and he was elected Governor of New York in [[New York state election, 1874|1874]]. As governor, he continued to focus on rooting out corruption. He helped to break up the \"[[Canal Ring (New York)|Canal Ring]],\" a bipartisan group of state and local officials who had enriched themselves by overcharging for the maintenance of the [[New York State Canal System]]. Tilden gained a national reputation as a reform governor, a valuable asset given the number of [[Grant administration scandals|scandals]] that had come into public view during the [[presidency of Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nIn 1875, Tilden received an honorary LL.D. from [[Yale University]].<ref name=Yale_Catalogue>{{cite book |last=Yale University |date=1877 |title=Catalogue of the Officers and Graduates of Yale University |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=UahGAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA51 |location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Morehouse and Taylor |page=51}}</ref> At the same time, Yale also enrolled him as a graduate of the Class of 1837 and he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree.<ref name=\"Yale_Catalogue\"/>\n\n==Presidential election of 1876==\n{{See also|Samuel Tilden presidential campaign, 1876}}\n\n===Democratic nomination===\n[[Image:Tilden and Hendricks campaign poster.jpg|thumb|Campaign poster for the election of 1876]]\n\nBy the time of the June [[1876 Democratic National Convention]], Tilden had emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 106</ref> Tilden's appeal to the national party was based on his reputation for reform and his electoral success in the country's most populous state. He was also a skilled organizer whose canvassing system and field knowledge was so thorough that, months before the 1874 election, he'd predicted his own winning margin accurately to within 300 votes.<ref>Holt (2008), p. 100</ref> Tilden further bolstered his presidential candidacy through a nationwide newspaper advertising campaign. As many Democrats expected that their party would win the 1876 presidential elections, Tilden faced competition from some of the party's most prominent leaders, including [[Thomas F. Bayard]], [[Allen G. Thurman]], [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], and General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nDuring the difficult economic times of the [[Panic of 1873]], the major ideological divide in the Democratic Party concerned the issue of [[History of monetary policy in the United States|currency]]. Many \"soft money\" Democrats wanted Congress to repeal the [[Specie Payment Resumption Act]] and authorize the printing of more [[greenback (money)|greenback]]s, [[banknotes]] that had first been printed during the Civil War. The printing of more greenbacks would result in [[inflation]] and potentially benefit farmers by raising prices and helping them pay down their debts. Like most Republicans and \"hard money\" members of the conservative business establishment, Tilden believed that the termination of greenback circulation (which would return the country to the [[gold standard]]) was the best way to solve the ongoing economic crisis. Tilden's lieutenants at the Democratic National Convention emphasized Tilden's reform credentials above all else, but they also ensured that the party platform endorsed Tilden's hard money views.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 108\u2013109, 112\u2013114</ref> \n\nTilden won a majority of the votes cast on the first presidential ballot of the convention, but fell short of the two-thirds majority required to win the Democratic presidential nomination. His closest rival was Hendricks, who had the support of New York party boss [[John Kelly (New York politician)|John Kelly]] and the soft money faction of Democrats. Tilden won the necessary two-thirds majority on the second presidential ballot, and the convention then voted to make his nomination unanimous. Delegates unanimously chose Hendricks as Tilden's running mate, providing a balance between the hard money and soft money factions.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 115\u2013117</ref> Though the Republicans had nominated a ticket led by [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] of Ohio, another governor who had established a reputation for honest governance, Tilden was widely regarded as the favorite in the general election.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 80\u201383, 122</ref>\n\n===General election===\n[[File:1876 U.S. presidential election, contested states.png|thumb|upright=1.5|In the aftermath of the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]], the electoral votes of four states were disputed.]]\n\nPer tradition, both Tilden and Hayes avoided publicly campaigning for president, leaving that task to their supporters; Tilden appointed [[Abram Hewitt]] to lead his campaign.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 123, 131\u2013132</ref> The Republican campaign established a major cash advantage, partly because Tilden refused to contribute much of his personal fortune to the campaign.<ref>Morris (2003), p. 121</ref> The Democrats campaigned on the theme of \"retrenchment and reform\" and attacked the \"corrupt centralism\" of the Grant administration.<ref name=\"morris118120\"/> Tilden blamed high taxes and the Grant administration for the economic downturn, and, like Hayes, promised [[U.S. Civil Service Reform|civil service reform]] and hard money policies.<ref>White (2017), pp. 328\u2013330</ref> Republicans, meanwhile, focused on their party's identification with Lincoln and the Union cause in the Civil War; many Republicans still associated the Democratic Party with slavery and disunion.<ref name=\"morris118120\">Morris (2003), pp. 118\u2013120</ref> Rebutting Republican charges, Tilden categorically denied that he had any intention of compensating the South for any slaves emancipated or losses suffered during the Civil War.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 161\u2013162</ref> For their part, many Democrats cared little for Tilden's emphasis on reform, and were instead focused on ending sixteen years of Republican leadership. Southern Democrats especially hoped to end [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and gain control of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana, the last three \"[[Redeemers|unredeemed]]\" Southern states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 125\u2013126, 146</ref> Southern whites, who overwhelmingly favored Tilden, used violence and intimidation to suppress the turnout of Republican-leaning [[African-American]] voters.<ref>White (2017), pp. 330\u2013331</ref> Tilden worked to distance himself from violent encounters like the [[Hamburg massacre]], in which disgruntled Southern whites clashed with the Republican-led government of South Carolina.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 129\u2013131</ref>\n\nBoth campaigns considered New York, Ohio, and Indiana to be the key [[swing states]], but the campaigns also focused on several smaller states, including the three unredeemed Southern states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 155\u2013156</ref> Ultimately, Hayes swept the West and won much of the North, but Tilden carried the closely contested Northern states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut, swept the [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]], and carried most of the South. He had won a majority of the popular vote and tallied clear victories in seventeen states, leaving him one [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]] short of a majority. On November 6, the day after election day, most major newspapers reported that Tilden had won the election; however, Hayes still had a narrow path to victory if he could sweep the electoral votes of Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 164\u2013166</ref> Hayes refused to formally concede, but told members of the press that he was \"of the opinion that the Democrats have carried the country and elected Tilden.\"<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 167\u2013171</ref> Tilden, meanwhile, urged his alarmed followers, many of whom believed that the Republicans were attempting to steal the election, to remain calm and refrain from violence. Both parties feared the possibility that a dispute over the election would lead to armed conflict; Tilden discussed appointing General [[George B. McClellan]] as his military assistant, while President Grant ordered army and naval units to reinforce Washington.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 172\u2013174</ref>\n\n===Post-election controversy===\n[[Image:SJTilden of NY.jpg|thumb|right|Samuel Jones Tilden]]\n\nWith the election in doubt, each party sent some of their most prominent leaders to monitor the election process in the three disputed Southern states. Initial election returns showed that Hayes had carried South Carolina by several hundred votes, but that Tilden had won Florida by 91 votes and Louisiana by over 6000 votes. Republicans controlled the bodies charged with determining the validity of election results in all three states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 174\u2013178</ref> On November 22, the South Carolina canvassing board adjourned after declaring that Hayes had won the state's electoral votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 180\u2013182</ref> On December 4, the Louisiana canvassing board announced that it had thrown out 15,623 votes due to \"systemic intimidation,\" leaving Hayes as the winner of all of the state's electoral votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 191\u2013192</ref> Early on the morning of December 6, the day the Electoral College was scheduled to convene, the Florida canvassing board announced that Hayes had won the state by a margin of 924 votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 193\u2013197</ref> Democrats challenged the results in all three contested Southern states. Meanwhile, another controversy had arisen in Oregon, where a Hayes elector, John Watts, resigned because his simultaneous service as a presidential elector and as a low-ranking official in the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] violated the [[United States Constitution]]. After Watts resigned, the state's Democratic governor appointed an elector to fill the vacancy, while, separately, the state's two remaining Hayes electors chose a third elector to fill the vacancy caused by Watts's resignation.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 183\u2013185, 197\u2013198</ref>\n\nOn December 6, the members of the Electoral College met in Washington, D.C., but the disputes in four states prevented a conclusive vote for president.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 197\u2013198</ref> With the Electoral College unable to select a president, the disputed election became an issue for Congress to settle; Republicans controlled the Senate, while Democrats controlled the House. The vague wording of the Constitution gave rise to further controversy, as Republicans held that [[Thomas W. Ferry]], a Republican senator from Michigan and the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]] of the [[United States Senate]], could determine the validity of the disputed electoral votes. Democrats argued that Ferry could only count the votes that were not disputed; in such a scenario, neither candidate would have an electoral vote majority, necessitating a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Since Democrats controlled a majority of the state delegations in the House, they would be able to elect Tilden as president in a contingent election.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 200\u2013201</ref> In response to the controversy, Tilden compiled his own study of electoral procedures in the previous 22 presidential elections. He delivered the study to every sitting member of Congress, but congressional Republicans were not swayed by Tilden's argument that history supported the Democratic position on the election returns.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 203\u2013204</ref> He continued to call for calm, and rejected Abram Hewitt's suggestion that he ask his supporters to engage in mass public demonstrations.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 206\u2013207, 214</ref>\n\n===Electoral Commission===\n[[File:President Rutherford Hayes 1870 - 1880 Restored.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Rutherford B. Hayes]] defeated Tilden in the 1876 election.]]\n\nOn January 26, both houses of Congress agreed to establish the 15-member [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the dispute over the contested electoral votes. The commission consisted of five Democratic members of Congress, five Republican members of Congress, and five justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Of the Supreme Court justices, two were to be Democrats, two were to be Republicans, and the fifth justice would be selected by the other four justices. Tilden opposed the creation of the Electoral Commission because he still hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives, but he was unable to prevent Democratic congressmen from voting for the establishment of the commission. Most had expected that the fifth justice on the commission would be Associate Justice [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], a [[political independent]], but Davis refused to serve on the commission after he accepted election to the Senate. Another associate justice, Republican [[Joseph P. Bradley]], was instead chosen as the fifth justice on the Electoral Commission.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 216\u2013219</ref> In a series of 8-to-7, party-line decisions, the Electoral Commission voted to award all of the contested electoral votes to Hayes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 222\u2013235</ref>\n\nEven after the Electoral Commission delivered its rulings, the House of Representatives could have blocked the inauguration of Hayes by refusing to certify the election results.<ref>White (2017), p. 332</ref> Though some House Democrats hoped to do just that, they were unable to prevent the House of Representatives from blocking certification, as many House Democrats joined with their Republican colleagues in accepting the results.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 235\u2013236</ref> During the proceedings of the Electoral Commission, high-ranking members of both parties had discussed the possibility of declaring Hayes the winner in exchange for the removal of all federal troops from the South. The [[Compromise of 1877]], as it became known, may have played a role in preventing the House from challenging the Electoral Commission's rulings, although author Roy Morris, Jr. argues that the compromise \"was more a mutual concession of the obvious than a device for controlling larger events.\"<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 232\u2013234</ref> Some other historians, including [[C.

Potter was appointed as the head of the commission, which Democrats hoped would implicate Hayes and damage the Republican Party in the next presidential election.<ref>Guenther (1983), 284\u2013285</ref> Rather than produce conclusive evidence of Republican malfeasance, the committee uncovered conflicting evidence that reflected poorly on election and campaign officials of both parties. For ten months beginning in May 1878, the Potter Committee subpoenaed all telegrams sent by political operatives during the election dispute. 29,275 telegrams had been sent, but all save 641 had been routinely destroyed by [[Western Union]]. The remaining telegrams were in cipher, as was common with business and political communication in the telegraph era. ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' editor [[Whitelaw Reid]] obtained and deciphered many of the telegrams and, in October 1878, he published the story of the Democratic efforts to sway election officials through bribery and other means. The revelation of the bribery attempts undercut the Democratic Party's argument that Tilden had been cheated out of the presidency.<ref>Kahn (1996), pp. 221\u2013229</ref> Tilden was not implicated in any wrongdoing, but the investigation into the Cipher Telegrams damaged his national standing.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 250\u2013251</ref>\n\n===Election of 1880===\n\nAfter the controversy over the election of 1876, Tilden became the presumptive Democratic candidate in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 presidential election]]. He declined to run for another term as governor in 1879, focusing instead on building support for the 1880 presidential nomination.<ref>Clancy (1958), p. 52</ref> The revelations of the Potter Committee, along with Tilden's persistent health issues, both damaged Tilden's national standing, but his superior political organization and personal fortune ensured that he remained a serious contender for the Democratic nomination.<ref>Clancy (1958), pp. 56\u201357</ref> Tilden's standing with the party slipped further following the Republican victory in the [[New York state election, 1879|New York gubernatorial election in 1879]]. In that election, a revitalized Tammany Hall organization split from the regular Democratic party in a patronage dispute with Tilden's faction.<ref>Clancy (1958), pp. 61\u201363</ref> In the months before the [[1880 Democratic National Convention]], rumors about Tilden's intentions circulated wildly, but Tilden refused to definitively state whether or not he would seek the Democratic nomination.<ref>Clancy (1958), pp. 74\u201375</ref>\n\nAs the New York delegation left for the national convention in Cincinnati, Tilden gave a letter to one of his chief supporters, [[Daniel Manning]], suggesting that his health might force him to decline the nomination.<ref>Clancy (1958), pp. 122\u2013123</ref> Tilden hoped to be nominated, but only if he was the unanimous choice of the convention; if not, Manning was entrusted to make the contents of Tilden's letter available to the New York delegation.<ref name=\"Goldman\">{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Andrew |date=2015 |orig-year=1990 |title=The National Party Chairmen and Committees |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0agDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT107 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Routledge |page=107 |isbn=978-1-3154-9067-0}}</ref> The New York delegation interpreted the letter as a notice of withdrawal, and the delegates began looking for a new candidate, eventually settling on Speaker of the House [[Samuel J.
