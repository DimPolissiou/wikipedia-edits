It was standard issue in the Russian army from 1870 to 1891, when it was replaced by the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] rifle. It was widely used in Russia as a hunting weapon, and sporting variants, including shotguns, were produced until the mid-1930s.\n\nThe ''Russian'' Berdan I (M1868) and Berdan II (M1870) rifles of .42 caliber are distinct from the ''Spanish'' Berdan 15mm (.58+ cal) conversion rifles adopted by Spain as the M1857/67 Berdan (and related engineer, artillery & short rifles).\n\n==Berdan I==\nTwo different versions of the later single-shot Berdan rifle were adopted as service weapons by Imperial Russia. The first version, manufactured by Colt in the US, is known as model 1868, or Berdan I. It is a hammerless \"trapdoor\" breechblock design, and was manufactured in limited numbers (the contract stipulated 30,000) as a full length infantry rifle. Colt also manufactured a few half-stock Berdan I cavalry carbine prototypes, but these were never adopted for Russian service. Colt even produced a few target rifles based on the Berdan I.\n\n==Berdan II==\nThe model 1870, or  Berdan II, is a single-shot bolt-action with a distinctive short, pear-shaped bolt handle. The bolt handle serves as the only locking lug for the action, and when closed, points upwards at a 30-degree angle, rather than horizontally. The Berdan II was produced in four variants: an infantry rifle, the lighter and slightly shorter dragoon rifle, a [[Cossack]] rifle with a button trigger and no trigger guard, and a cavalry [[carbine]]. Infantry and dragoon rifles were issued with quadrangular socket bayonets. Initial production of the Berdan II was at Birmingham Small Arms in England. The rifles were later manufactured in large numbers by Russian factories at [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], [[Izhevsk]], and [[Sestroretsk]]. Estimated total production of all models is over 3 million. The rifle was known for its accuracy, simplicity and reliability.\n[[Image:Berdan Musket Breech Apparatus Diagram.png|right|300px]]\n\n==Cartridge==\nThe 10.7\u00d758mmR cartridge used in the Berdan was also invented by Hiram Berdan, with the assistance of Russian colonel {{ill|Alexander Gorlov (military)|ru|\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|lt=Alexander Gorlov|vertical-align=sup}}. It was the subject of many patents in both the United States and United Kingdom. The bottleneck cartridge case used the Berdan primer, its first use in a small arms cartridge. Cartridges were issued in blue paper packets of six rounds each. In addition to the regular cartridge for rifles, a special cartridge was manufactured for use in the cavalry carbine. It consisted of the same cartridge case and bullet, but with a lighter powder charge of only 4.5 grams, and was issued in six round pink paper packets. At the time of its use, the 10.75\u00d758mmR (4.2 line) cartridge was known for its power and accuracy.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Later usage==\nNo magazine-fed versions of the Berdan ever progressed beyond the prototype phase. Russian troops, however, did have various cartridge holders, such as the Krnka quick-loader, attached to their rifles to aid in reloading. By the late 1880s Russia began the process of replacing the Berdan with a high velocity and magazine fed rifle, and this resulted in the adoption of the Mosin\u2013Nagant. In 1892, a batch of 3,004 Berdan II rifles were converted to [[7.62\u00d754mmR]] for Russian service by arms makers in Belgium. These rifles have new barrels and sights, and new bolts with a front locking lug and longer bolt handle. Had the conversion been deemed fit for service, an additional 40,000 were to be converted. However this did not go through.\n\nSporting rifles and shotguns were re-manufactured in Russia from surplus rifles after the Mosin\u2013Nagant was adopted into service.<ref>\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d\u044a \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b // \u00ab\u041a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u044a \u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0434\u043b\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0445\u043e\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0430 1898/99 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u044a. \u0422\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u044a \u042f. \u0417\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u041a\u043e\u00bb. \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430, 1898. \u0441\u0442\u0440.66</ref><ref>\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430 // \u00ab\u041c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440-\u0440\u0443\u0436\u044c\u0451\u00bb, \u2116 12 (141), 2008, \u0441\u0442\u0440.36-41</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"Finally I thought of something: I offered to him to exchange his old gun for a new one.

The manufacturer's name in Cyrillic, date of manufacture, and rifle serial number, are on the top of the barrel. Some rifles also show a date of manufacture on the receiver. The serial number was also applied to the bolt. Additional proof marks and property markings are found on the receiver and barrel.

Russian forces, although ultimately victorious, were badly mauled by the very long range fire from Turk Peabody\u2013Martini rifles during the [[Siege of Plevna]]. After the war a long-range auxiliary sight was adopted and retrofitted to the Berdan II infantry rifle. The Berdanka, as it was called, continued on in Russian service even after the adoption of the Mosin\u2013Nagant, primarily with reserve and rear echelon units when the Mosin-Nagant became plentiful. Many Russian troops had Berdan rifles in the [[Russo-Japanese war]] of 1905. During [[World War I]], some Russian second line, training and service units were armed with the Berdan II.<ref>\"''\u0412\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0432 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 - \u044f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0410\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0440.1897 \u0438 1905 \u0433\u0433., \u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e-\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u041c\u0430\u043d\u043b\u0438\u0445\u0435\u0440\u0430 1889 \u0438 1895 \u0433\u0433., \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \"88\" \u0438 \"98\". \u041a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u044b, \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0441\u043d\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u044b\u043c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043c - '''\u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u2116 2 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u0430 1870 \u0433.''', \u0413\u0440\u0430 1874 \u0433., \u0413\u0440\u0430-\u041a\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043a\u0430 1874/85 \u0433., \u0412\u0435\u0442\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0438 1870/87 \u0433.''\"<br/>\u0410. \u0411. \u0416\u0443\u043a. \u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f: \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044b, \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u044b, \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438, \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u044b-\u043f\u0443\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044b, \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b. \u041c., \u0410\u0421\u0422 \u2014 \u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 2002. \u0441\u0442\u0440.587</ref> It is common to see Berdan rifles in photos of street fighting taken during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].\n* {{flag|Ethiopian Empire}}: The Russian Empire sent 30,000 Berdan rifles to Ethiopia before the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]]<ref>\u0413. \u0412. \u0426\u044b\u043f\u043a\u0438\u043d, \u0412. \u0421. \u042f\u0433\u044c\u044f. \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u042d\u0444\u0438\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f. \u041c.: \u00ab\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430\u00bb, 1989. \u0441\u0442\u0440. 111</ref>\n* [[File:Flag of Bulgaria.svg|border|20px]] [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]]: Berdan II was adopted by Bulgarian army\n* [[image:State Flag of Serbia (1882-1918).svg|25px]] [[Kingdom of Serbia]] in 1890 received 76,000 rifles as military aid.

In the Finnish Civil War of 1918, troops stationed in Finland still had Berdan rifles in storage and some 2nd line troops continued to employ the Berdan II. During this conflict, newer rifles were not always available in needed numbers, so Berdans saw limited use on both sides.  As the Finnish military was not interested in the obsolete Berdan, in 1919 some 2,500 were issued to the [[Suojeluskunta]] (National Guard) General HQ. When the Suojeluskunta obtained modern rifles, the Berdans were returned to Finnish Army stores. About 3,000 Berdan rifles were issued to Finnish troops during the initial stages of the 1939 [[Winter War]] due to the great lack of modern infantry weapons. These rifles were replaced by more modern rifles as soon as it was possible. It appears that the Finns retained the Berdan rifles in store until scrapping them starting in 1945. In 1955 the remaining 1,029 were sold abroad, mostly in the U.S., through surplus arms dealers.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Berdan Sharps rifle]]\n*[[List of Russian weaponry]]\n*[[Table of handgun and rifle cartridges]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|Berdan II}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160827001455/http://www.militaryrifles.com/ MilitaryRifles.com]\n\n[[Category:7.62\u00d754mmR rifles]]\n[[Category:Single-shot bolt-action rifles]]\n[[Category:Early rifles]]\n[[Category:Rifles of the United States]]\n[[Category:Rifles of the Russian Empire]]\n[[Category:Russo-Japanese war weapons of Russia]]\n[[Category:Guns of the American West]]\n[[Category:Hinged breechblock rifles]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2016}}\n{{Infobox weapon\n|name= Berdan rifles Nos. 1 and 2\n|image= [[File:Russian_Berdan_No1_Rifle.jpg|300px]][[Image:Russian_Berdan_No2_Rifle.jpg|300px]]\n|caption= \n|origin= United States<br>Russia\n|type= [[Service rifle]]\n<!-- Type selection -->\n|is_ranged= yes\n<!-- Service history -->\n|service= 1870\u20131895, later as reserve issue\n|used_by= [[Russian Empire]]<br>[[Kingdom of Bulgaria]]<br>[[Kingdom of Greece]]<br>[[Ottoman Empire]]<br>[[Kingdom of Romania]]<br>[[Finland]] (limited)<br>[[Kingdom of Montenegro]]<br>[[Kingdom of Serbia]]<br>[[Outer Mongolia (1911\u20131919)|Outer Mongolia]]<br>[[Persia]]<br>[[Ethiopian Empire]]\n|wars= [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]]<br>[[First Italo-Ethiopian War]]<br>[[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]]<br>[[Russo-Japanese War]] (limited)<br>[[Balkan Wars]]<br>[[World War I]] (limited)<br>[[Russian Revolution]]<br>[[Finnish Civil War]]<br>[[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]<br>[[Winter War]] (limited)\n<!-- Production history -->\n|designer= [[Hiram Berdan]]\n|design_date= 1868 (Berdan I)<br/>1870 (Berdan II)\n|manufacturer=\n|production_date=1869\u20131891\n|number= 3,000,000\n|variants= Berdan I: infantry rifle<br/>Berdan II: infantry rifle, dragoon rifle, cossack rifle, cavalry carbine\n<!-- General specifications -->\n|weight= {{convert|4.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}} without bayonet<br>{{convert|4.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}} with bayonet\n|length= {{convert|130|cm|in|abbr=on}} (infantry rifle)\n|part_length= {{convert|83|cm|in|abbr=on}} (infantry rifle)\n|width=\n|height=\n|diameter=\n|crew=\n<!-- Ranged weapon specifications --> \n|cartridge= 10.75\u00d758 mmR; 24 gram paper-patched round nose lead bullet, 5 gram black powder; cartridge also known as .42 Berdan or 4.2 Line Berdan, <br>[[7.62\u00d754mmR]]\n|caliber=\n|action= Berdan I \"trapdoor\"; Berdan II \"bolt\"\n|rate= 6\u20138 rounds per minute\n|velocity= 437&nbsp;m/s\n|range= 400 arshins (284&nbsp;m, 310.6&nbsp;yd)\n|max_range= \n|feed= [[Single-shot]]\n|sights= rear sight in \"[[Obsolete Russian units of measurement#Length|arshins]]\" 200\u20131200; front sight is inverted v; some infantry rifles have a long range \"volley sight\" on the right side of front barrel band, along with a second \"V\" on the right side of the rear sight slide\n}}\n\nThe '''Berdan rifle''' (''\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430''/''vintovka Berdana'' in Russian) is a Russian rifle created by the American firearms expert and inventor [[Hiram Berdan]] in 1868. It was standard issue in the Russian army from 1870 to 1891, when it was replaced by the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] rifle. It was widely used in Russia as a hunting weapon, and sporting variants, including shotguns, were produced until the mid-1930s.\n\nThe ''Russian'' Berdan I (M1868) and Berdan II (M1870) rifles of .42 caliber are distinct from the ''Spanish'' Berdan 15mm (.58+ cal) conversion rifles adopted by Spain as the M1857/67 Berdan (and related engineer, artillery & short rifles).\n\n==Berdan I==\nTwo different versions of the later single-shot Berdan rifle were adopted as service weapons by Imperial Russia. The first version, manufactured by Colt in the US, is known as model 1868, or Berdan I. It is a hammerless \"trapdoor\" breechblock design, and was manufactured in limited numbers (the contract stipulated 30,000) as a full length infantry rifle. Colt also manufactured a few half-stock Berdan I cavalry carbine prototypes, but these were never adopted for Russian service. Colt even produced a few target rifles based on the Berdan I.\n\n==Berdan II==\nThe model 1870, or  Berdan II, is a single-shot bolt-action with a distinctive short, pear-shaped bolt handle. The bolt handle serves as the only locking lug for the action, and when closed, points upwards at a 30-degree angle, rather than horizontally. The Berdan II was produced in four variants: an infantry rifle, the lighter and slightly shorter dragoon rifle, a [[Cossack]] rifle with a button trigger and no trigger guard, and a cavalry [[carbine]]. Infantry and dragoon rifles were issued with quadrangular socket bayonets. Initial production of the Berdan II was at Birmingham Small Arms in England. The rifles were later manufactured in large numbers by Russian factories at [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], [[Izhevsk]], and [[Sestroretsk]]. Estimated total production of all models is over 3 million. The rifle was known for its accuracy, simplicity and reliability.\n[[Image:Berdan Musket Breech Apparatus Diagram.png|right|300px]]\n\n==Cartridge==\nThe 10.7\u00d758mmR cartridge used in the Berdan was also invented by Hiram Berdan, with the assistance of Russian colonel {{ill|Alexander Gorlov (military)|ru|\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|lt=Alexander Gorlov|vertical-align=sup}}. It was the subject of many patents in both the United States and United Kingdom. The bottleneck cartridge case used the Berdan primer, its first use in a small arms cartridge. Cartridges were issued in blue paper packets of six rounds each. In addition to the regular cartridge for rifles, a special cartridge was manufactured for use in the cavalry carbine. It consisted of the same cartridge case and bullet, but with a lighter powder charge of only 4.5 grams, and was issued in six round pink paper packets. At the time of its use, the 10.75\u00d758mmR (4.2 line) cartridge was known for its power and accuracy.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Later usage==\nNo magazine-fed versions of the Berdan ever progressed beyond the prototype phase. Russian troops, however, did have various cartridge holders, such as the Krnka quick-loader, attached to their rifles to aid in reloading. By the late 1880s Russia began the process of replacing the Berdan with a high velocity and magazine fed rifle, and this resulted in the adoption of the Mosin\u2013Nagant. In 1892, a batch of 3,004 Berdan II rifles were converted to [[7.62\u00d754mmR]] for Russian service by arms makers in Belgium. These rifles have new barrels and sights, and new bolts with a front locking lug and longer bolt handle. Had the conversion been deemed fit for service, an additional 40,000 were to be converted. However this did not go through.\n\nSporting rifles and shotguns were re-manufactured in Russia from surplus rifles after the Mosin\u2013Nagant was adopted into service.<ref>\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d\u044a \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b // \u00ab\u041a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u044a \u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0434\u043b\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0445\u043e\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0430 1898/99 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u044a. \u0422\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u044a \u042f. \u0417\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u041a\u043e\u00bb. \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430, 1898. \u0441\u0442\u0440.66</ref><ref>\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430 // \u00ab\u041c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440-\u0440\u0443\u0436\u044c\u0451\u00bb, \u2116 12 (141), 2008, \u0441\u0442\u0440.36-41</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"Finally I thought of something: I offered to him to exchange his old gun for a new one.

The manufacturer's name in Cyrillic, date of manufacture, and rifle serial number, are on the top of the barrel. Some rifles also show a date of manufacture on the receiver.

The Berdanka, as it was called, continued on in Russian service even after the adoption of the Mosin\u2013Nagant, primarily with reserve and rear echelon units when the Mosin-Nagant became plentiful. Many Russian troops had Berdan rifles in the [[Russo-Japanese war]] of 1905. During [[World War I]], some Russian second line, training and service units were armed with the Berdan II.<ref>\"''\u0412\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0432 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 - \u044f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0410\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0440.1897 \u0438 1905 \u0433\u0433., \u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e-\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u041c\u0430\u043d\u043b\u0438\u0445\u0435\u0440\u0430 1889 \u0438 1895 \u0433\u0433., \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \"88\" \u0438 \"98\". \u041a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u044b, \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0441\u043d\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u044b\u043c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043c - '''\u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u2116 2 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u0430 1870 \u0433.''', \u0413\u0440\u0430 1874 \u0433., \u0413\u0440\u0430-\u041a\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043a\u0430 1874/85 \u0433., \u0412\u0435\u0442\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0438 1870/87 \u0433.''\"<br/>\u0410. \u0411. \u0416\u0443\u043a. \u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f: \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044b, \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u044b, \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438, \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u044b-\u043f\u0443\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044b, \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b. \u041c., \u0410\u0421\u0422 \u2014 \u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 2002. \u0441\u0442\u0440.587</ref> It is common to see Berdan rifles in photos of street fighting taken during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].\n* {{flag|Ethiopian Empire}}: The Russian Empire sent 30,000 Berdan rifles to Ethiopia before the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]]<ref>\u0413. \u0412. \u0426\u044b\u043f\u043a\u0438\u043d, \u0412. \u0421. \u042f\u0433\u044c\u044f. \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u042d\u0444\u0438\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f. \u041c.: \u00ab\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430\u00bb, 1989. \u0441\u0442\u0440. 111</ref>\n* [[File:Flag of Bulgaria.svg|border|20px]] [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]]: Berdan II was adopted by Bulgarian army\n* [[image:State Flag of Serbia (1882-1918).svg|25px]] [[Kingdom of Serbia]] in 1890 received 76,000 rifles as military aid.

In the Finnish Civil War of 1918, troops stationed in Finland still had Berdan rifles in storage and some 2nd line troops continued to employ the Berdan II. During this conflict, newer rifles were not always available in needed numbers, so Berdans saw limited use on both sides.  As the Finnish military was not interested in the obsolete Berdan, in 1919 some 2,500 were issued to the [[Suojeluskunta]] (National Guard) General HQ. When the Suojeluskunta obtained modern rifles, the Berdans were returned to Finnish Army stores. About 3,000 Berdan rifles were issued to Finnish troops during the initial stages of the 1939 [[Winter War]] due to the great lack of modern infantry weapons. These rifles were replaced by more modern rifles as soon as it was possible. It appears that the Finns retained the Berdan rifles in store until scrapping them starting in 1945. In 1955 the remaining 1,029 were sold abroad, mostly in the U.S., through surplus arms dealers.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Berdan Sharps rifle]]\n*[[List of Russian weaponry]]\n*[[Table of handgun and rifle cartridges]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|Berdan II}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160827001455/http://www.militaryrifles.com/ MilitaryRifles.com]\n\n[[Category:7.62\u00d754mmR rifles]]\n[[Category:Single-shot bolt-action rifles]]\n[[Category:Early rifles]]\n[[Category:Rifles of the United States]]\n[[Category:Rifles of the Russian Empire]]\n[[Category:Russo-Japanese war weapons of Russia]]\n[[Category:Guns of the American West]]\n[[Category:Hinged breechblock rifles]]\n", "name_user": "WikiFirearms", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Undid revision 951358316 byCommonsDelinker(talk))", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berdan_rifle"}
