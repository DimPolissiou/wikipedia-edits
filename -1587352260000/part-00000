They remain a key component of the [[Japanese writing system]] where they are known as ''[[kanji]]''. Chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://en.artintern.net/index.php/news/main/html/1/1101|title=History of Chinese Writing Shown in the Museums|publisher=CCTV online|accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref> By virtue of their widespread current use in East Asia, and historic use throughout the [[Adoption of Chinese literary culture|Sinosphere]], Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world by number of users. Chinese characters number in the tens of thousands, though most of them are minor graphic variants encountered only in historical texts. Unlike an alphabet, a character-based writing system associates each logogram with an entire sound and thus may be compared in some aspects to a syllabary.\n\n[[Functional literacy]] in [[written Chinese]] requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=73}} In Japan, 2,136 are taught through secondary school (the ''[[J\u014dy\u014d kanji]]''); hundreds more are in everyday use. Due to [[Shinjitai|post-WWII simplifications of characters in Japan]] as well as [[Simplified Chinese characters|in China]], the Chinese characters used in Japan today are distinct from those used in China in several respects. There are various national standard lists of characters, forms, and pronunciations. [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified forms of certain characters]] are used in mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia; the corresponding [[traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]] are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and to a limited extent in South Korea. In Japan, common characters are written in [[shinjitai|post-WWII Japan-specific simplified forms]], while uncommon characters are written in [[ky\u016bjitai|Japanese traditional forms]], which are virtually identical to Chinese traditional forms.\n\nIn modern Chinese, the majority of Chinese words today consist of two or more characters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Clare Patricia|title=Contemporary perspectives on reading and spelling| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z6d5AgAAQBAJ | year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-49716-9|page=203|author2=Connelly, Vincent|quote=Often, the Chinese character can function as an independent unit in sentences, but sometimes it must be paired with another character or more to form a word. [...] Most words consist of two or more characters, and more than 80 per cent make use of lexical compounding of morphemes (Packard, 2000).}}</ref> A character almost always corresponds to a single syllable that is also a [[morpheme]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/east_asian_languages.html |title=East Asian Languages at |publisher=Pinyin.info |date= |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> However, there are a few exceptions to this general correspondence, including bisyllabic morphemes (written with two characters), bimorphemic syllables (written with two characters) and cases where a single character represents a polysyllabic word or phrase.<ref name=\"vmair\" />\n\nModern Chinese has many [[homophone]]s; thus the same spoken syllable may be represented by many characters, depending on meaning. A single character may also have a range of meanings, or sometimes quite distinct meanings; occasionally these correspond to different pronunciations. [[Cognate]]s in the several [[varieties of Chinese]] are generally written with the same character. In other languages, most significantly today in Japanese and sometimes in Korean, characters are used to represent Chinese loanwords, to represent native words independently of the Chinese pronunciation (e.g., [[kunyomi]] in Japanese), and as purely phonetic elements based on their pronunciation in the historical variety of Chinese from which they were acquired. These foreign adaptations of Chinese pronunciation are known as [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]] and have been useful in the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstruction]] of [[Middle Chinese]].\n\n==Function==\nWhen the script was first used in the late 2nd millennium&nbsp;BC, words of [[Old Chinese]] were generally monosyllabic, and each character denoted a single word.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=58}} Increasing numbers of polysyllabic words have entered the language from the [[Western Zhou]] period to the present day. It is estimated that about 25\u201330% of the vocabulary of classic texts from the [[Warring States period]] was polysyllabic, though these words were used far less commonly than monosyllables, which accounted for 80\u201390% of occurrences in these texts.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=22}}\nThe process has accelerated over the centuries as phonetic change has increased the number of homophones.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=112}}\nIt has been estimated that over two thirds of the 3,000 most common words in modern [[Standard Chinese]] are polysyllables, the vast majority of those being disyllables.{{sfn|Yip|2000|p=18}}\n\nThe most common process has been to form [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] of existing words, written with the characters of the constituent words. Words have also been created by adding [[affixes]], [[reduplication]] and [[loanword|borrowing]] from other languages.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=155\u2013156}}\nPolysyllabic words are generally written with one character per syllable.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=74}}{{efn|Abbreviations are occasionally used \u2013 see {{section link||Polysyllabic characters}}.}}\nIn most cases the character denotes a [[morpheme]] descended from an Old Chinese word.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=74\u201375}}\n\nMany characters have multiple readings, with instances denoting different morphemes, sometimes with different pronunciations. In modern Standard Chinese, one fifth of the 2,400 most common characters have multiple pronunciations.\nFor the 500 most common characters, the proportion rises to 30%.<ref>{{cite web | title = Chinese characters with multiple pronunciations | given = Mark | surname = Swofford | website = pinyin.info | year = 2010 | url = http://pinyin.info/chinese_characters/ | access-date = 4 July 2016 }}</ref>\nOften these readings are similar in sound and related in meaning. In the Old Chinese period, [[affix]]es could be added to a word to form a new word, which was often written with the same character. In many cases the pronunciations diverged due to subsequent [[sound change]]. For example, many additional readings have the [[Middle Chinese]] departing tone, the major source of the 4th tone in modern Standard Chinese. Scholars now believe that this tone is the reflex of an Old Chinese *-s suffix, with a range of semantic functions.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=315\u2013317}}\nFor example,\n* {{zh|s=\u4f20|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=\u50b3|labels=no}} has readings OC *drjon > MC ''drjwen'' > Mod. ''chu\u00e1n'' 'to transmit' and *drjons > ''drjwenH'' > ''zhu\u00e0n'' 'a record'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=315}} (Middle Chinese forms are given in [[Baxter's transcription for Middle Chinese|Baxter's transcription]], in which ''H'' denotes the departing tone.)\n* {{zh|c=\u78e8|labels=no}} has readings *maj > ''ma'' > ''m\u00f3'' 'to grind' and *majs > ''maH'' > ''m\u00f2'' 'grindstone'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=315}}\n* {{zh|c=\u5bbf|labels=no}} has readings *sjuk > ''sjuwk'' > ''s\u00f9'' 'to stay overnight' and *sjuks > ''sjuwH'' > ''xi\u00f9'' 'celestial \"mansion\"'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=316}}\n* {{zh|s=\u8bf4|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=\u8aac|labels=no}} has readings *hljot > ''sywet'' > ''shu\u014d'' 'speak' and *hljots > ''sywejH'' > ''shu\u00ec'' 'exhort'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=197, 305}}\nAnother common alternation is between voiced and voiceless initials (though the voicing distinction has disappeared on most modern varieties).\nThis is believed to reflect an ancient prefix, but scholars disagree on whether the voiced or voiceless form is the original root.\nFor example,\n* {{zh|s=\u89c1|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=\u898b|labels=no}} has readings *kens > ''kenH'' > ''ji\u00e0n'' 'to see' and *gens > ''henH'' > ''xi\u00e0n'' 'to appear'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=218}}\n* {{zh|s=\u8d25|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=\u6557|labels=no}} has readings *prats > ''p\u00e6jH'' > ''b\u00e0i'' 'to defeat' and *brats > ''b\u00e6jH'' > ''b\u00e0i'' 'to be defeated'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=218}} (In this case the pronunciations have converged in Standard Chinese, but not in some other varieties.)\n* {{zh|c=\u6298|labels=no}} has readings *tjat > ''tsyet'' > ''zh\u00e9'' 'to bend' and *djat > ''dzyet'' > ''sh\u00e9'' 'to break by bending'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=219}}\n\n==Principles of formation==\n[[File:chineseprimer3.png|right|upright=0.7|thumb|Excerpt from a 1436 primer on Chinese characters]]\n{{Main|Chinese character classification}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 300\n | footer = Evolution of pictograms\n  | image1 = Evo-r\u00ec.svg\n | caption1 = Sun\n | image2 = Evo-sh\u0101n.svg\n |caption2 = Mountain\n | image3 = Evo-elephant.png\n | caption3 = Elephant\n}}\nChinese characters represent words of the language using several strategies. A few characters, including some of the most commonly used, were originally [[pictogram]]s, which depicted the objects denoted, or [[ideogram]]s, in which meaning was expressed [[iconicity|iconically]]. The vast majority were written using the [[rebus principle]], in which a character for a similarly sounding word was either simply borrowed or (more commonly) extended with a disambiguating semantic marker to form a phono-semantic compound character.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=58\u201361}}\n\nThe traditional six-fold classification (''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|li\u00f9sh\u016b}}'' {{lang|zh-Hans|\u516d\u4e66}} / {{lang|zh-Hant|\u516d\u66f8}} \"six writings\") was first described by the scholar [[Xu Shen]] in the postface of his dictionary ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' in 100&nbsp;AD.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=67\u201369}}\nWhile this analysis is sometimes problematic and arguably fails to reflect the complete nature of the Chinese writing system, it has been perpetuated by its long history and pervasive use.\n\n===Pictograms===\n* {{lang|zh|\u8c61\u5f62\u5b57}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|xi\u00e0ngx\u00edngz\u00ec}}''\n[[Pictogram]]s are highly stylized and simplified pictures of material objects.  Examples of pictograms include {{lang|zh|\u65e5}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|r\u00ec}}'' for \"sun\", {{lang|zh|\u6708}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|yu\u00e8}}'' for \"moon\", and {{lang|zh|\u6728}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|m\u00f9}}'' for \"tree\" or \"wood\". Xu Shen placed approximately 4% of characters in this category. \nThough few in number and expressing literal objects, pictograms and ideograms are nonetheless the basis on which all the more complex characters such as associative idea characters  (\u4f1a\u610f\u5b57) and pictophonetic characters (\u5f62\u58f0\u5b57) are formed.\n\nPictograms are primary characters in the sense that they, along with ideograms (indicative characters i.e. symbols), are the building blocks of compound characters (\u610f\u610f\u5b57) and picto-phonetic characters (\u5f62\u58f0\u5b57). \n\nOver time pictograms were increasingly standardized, simplified, and stylized to make them easier to write. Furthermore, the same kangxi radical character element can be used to depict different objects. \nThus, the image depicted by most pictograms is not often immediately evident. For example \u53e3 may indicate the mouth, a window as in \u9ad8 which depicts a tall building as a symbol of the idea of \"tall\" or the lip of a vessel as in \u5bcc a wine jar under a roof as symbol of wealth.  That is, pictograms extended from literal objects to take on symbolic or metaphoric meanings; sometimes even displacing the use of the character as a literal term, or creating ambiguity, which was resolved though character determinants, more commonly but less accurately known as \"radicals\" i.e. concept keys in the phono-semantic characters.\n\n===Simple ideograms===\n* {{lang|zh|\u6307\u4e8b\u5b57}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|zh\u01d0sh\u00ecz\u00ec}}''\n\nAlso called ''simple indicatives,'' this small category contains characters that are direct [[iconicity|iconic]] illustrations. Examples include {{lang|zh|\u4e0a}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|sh\u00e0ng}}'' \"up\" and {{lang|zh|\u4e0b}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|xi\u00e0}}'' \"down\", originally a dot above and below a line. Indicative characters are symbols for abstract concepts which could not be depicted literally but nonetheless can be expressed as a visual symbol e.g. concave \u51f8 \uff0c convex \u51f9, flat-and-level \u5e73\n\n===Associative idea characters (compound conceptual characters)===\n* {{lang|zh-Hans|\u4f1a\u610f\u5b57}} / {{lang|zh-Hant|\u6703\u610f\u5b57}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|hu\u00ecy\u00ecz\u00ec}}''\nAlso translated as logical aggregates or associative compounds, these characters have been interpreted as combining two or more pictographic or ideographic characters to suggest a third meaning.  The canonical example is {{lang|zh|\u660e}} bright. \u660e is the association of the two brightest objects in the sky the sun \u65e5 and moon \u6708, brought together to express the idea of \"bright\". It is canonical because the term \u660e\u767d in Chinese (lit. \"bright white\") means \"to understand, understand\". Other commonly cited examples include {{lang|zh|\u4f11}} \"rest\" (composed of the pictograms {{lang|zh|\u4eba}} \"person\" and {{lang|zh|\u6728}} \"tree\") and {{lang|zh|\u597d}} \"good\" (composed of {{lang|zh|\u5973}} \"woman\" and {{lang|zh|\u5b50}} \"child\").\n\nXu Shen placed approximately 13% of characters in this category, but many of his examples are now believed to be phono-semantic compounds whose origin has been obscured by subsequent changes in their form.{{sfn|Sampson|Chen|2013|p=261}} [[Peter Boodberg]] and William Boltz go so far as to deny that any of the compound characters devised in ancient times were of this type, maintaining that now-lost \"secondary readings\" are responsible for the apparent absence of phonetic indicators,{{sfn|Boltz|1994|pp=104\u2013110}} but their arguments have been rejected by other scholars.{{sfn|Sampson|Chen|2013|pp=265\u2013268}}\n\nIn contrast, associative compound characters are common among [[kokuji|characters coined in Japan]]. Also, a few characters coined in China in modern times, such as {{lang|zh-Hant|\u9251}} platinum, \"white metal\" (see [[chemical elements in East Asian languages]]) belong to this category.\n\n===Rebus===\n* {{lang|zh|\u5047\u501f\u5b57}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|ji\u01ceji\u00e8z\u00ec}}''\n\nAlso called ''borrowings'' or ''phonetic loan characters,'' the [[rebus]] category covers cases where an existing character is used to represent an unrelated word with similar or identical pronunciation; sometimes the old meaning is then lost completely, as with characters such as {{lang|zh|\u81ea}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|z\u00ec}}'', which has lost its original meaning of \"nose\" completely and exclusively means \"oneself\", or {{lang|zh-Hant|\u842c}}<!--NOT \u4e07, no adding this character, which has not relevant origins--> ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|w\u00e0n}}'', which originally meant \"scorpion\" but is now used only in the sense of \"ten thousand\".\n\nRebus was pivotal in the history of writing in China insofar as it represented the stage at which logographic writing could become purely phonetic (phonographic). Chinese characters used purely for their sound values are attested in the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States]] period manuscripts, in which ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|zhi}}'' {{lang|zh|\u6c0f}} was used to write ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|shi}}'' {{lang|zh|\u662f}} and vice versa, just lines apart; the same happened with ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|shao}}'' \u52fa for ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|Zhao}}'' {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8d99}}, with the characters in question being homophonous or nearly homophonous at the time.{{sfn|Boltz|1994|p=169}}\n\n====Phonetical usage for foreign words====\nChinese characters are used rebus-like and exclusively for their phonetic value when transcribing words of foreign origin, such as ancient Buddhist terms or modern foreign names. For example, the word for the country \"[[Romania]]\" is \u7f57\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a (Lu\u00f3 M\u01ce N\u00ed Y\u00e0), in which the Chinese characters are only used for their sounds and do not provide any meaning.<ref name=\"AEG\">{{cite book |last1=Gnanadesikan |first1=Amalia E. |title=The Writing Revolution: Cuneiform to the Internet |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9781444359855 |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nlEPhP900-UC&pg=PT61 |language=en}}</ref> This usage is similar to that of the Japanese [[Katakana]], although the Katakanas use a special set of simplified forms of Chinese characters, in order to advertize their value as purely phonetic symbols.

These characters are composed of at least two parts. A semantic component, often a character key as a clue to the topic to which the character refers, often in an abbreviated form, The [[semantics|semantic]] component suggests the general meaning of the compound character. The  [[phonetics|phonetic]] component suggests the pronunciation of the compound character. In most cases the semantic indicator is also the \u90e8\u9996 [[radical (Chinese characters)|radical]] under which the character is listed in dictionaries. Because Chinese is replete in homophones phonetic elements may also carry semantic content. In some rare examples phono-semantic characters may also convey pictorial content. Each Chinese character is an attempt to combine sound, image, and idea in a mutually reinforcing fashion.\n\nExamples of phono-semantic characters include {{lang|zh|\u6cb3}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|h\u00e9}}'' \"river\", {{lang|zh|\u6e56}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|h\u00fa}}'' \"lake\", {{lang|zh|\u6d41}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|li\u00fa}}'' \"stream\", {{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c96}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|ch\u014dng}}'' \"surge\", {{lang|zh|\u6ed1}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|hu\u00e1}}'' \"slippery\". All these characters have on the left a radical of three short strokes (\u6c35), which is a reduced form of the character \u6c34 ''shu\u01d0'' meaning \"water\", indicating that the character has a semantic connection with water. The right-hand side in each case is a phonetic indicator. For example, in the case of {{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c96}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|ch\u014dng}}'' (Old Chinese {{IPA|*\u0261-lju\u014b}}{{sfn|Baxter|1992|p=750}}) \"surge\", the phonetic indicator is {{lang|zh|\u4e2d}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|zh\u014dng}}'' (Old Chinese {{IPA|*k-lju\u014b}}{{sfn|Baxter|1992|p=810}}), which by itself means \"middle\". In this case it can be seen that the pronunciation of the character is slightly different from that of its phonetic indicator; the effect of historical sound change means that the composition of such characters can sometimes seem arbitrary today.\n\nIn general, phonetic components do not determine the exact pronunciation of a character, but only give a clue to a its pronunciation. While some characters take the exact pronunciation of their phonetic component, others take only the initial or final sounds.{{sfn|Williams}} In fact, some characters' pronunciations may not correspond to the pronunciations of their phonetic parts at all, which is sometimes the case with characters after having undergone simplification. The 8 characters in the following table all take \u4e5f for their phonetic part, however, as it is readily apparent, none of them take the pronunciation of \u4e5f, which is y\u011b (Old Chinese *laj\u0294).

Many [[Periodic table in East Asian languages|Chinese names of elements in the periodic table]] and many other [[Organic nomenclature in Chinese|chemistry-related characters]] were formed this way. In fact, it is possible to tell from a Chinese periodic table at a glance which elements are metal ({{Lang|zh|\u91d1}}), solid nonmetal ({{Lang|zh|\u77f3}}, \"stone\"), liquid ({{Lang|zh|\u6c35}}), or gas ({{Lang|zh|\u6c14}}).\n\nOccasionally a bisyllabic word is written with two characters that contain the same radical, as in {{lang|zh|\u8774\u8776}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|h\u00fadi\u00e9}}'' \"butterfly\", where both characters have the insect radical {{lang|zh|\u866b}}.

As early as the Shang dynasty, oracle-bone script coexisted as a simplified form alongside the normal script of [[bamboo]] books (preserved in typical [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronze inscriptions]]), as well as the extra-elaborate pictorial forms (often clan emblems) found on many bronzes.[[File:Western Zhou Ritual Containers3.jpg|thumb|left|Left: Bronze f\u0101ngz\u016bn ({{linktext|\u65b9|\u6a3d|lang=zh}}) ritual wine container dated about 1000&nbsp;BC.

The inscription comments on state rituals that accompanied court ceremony, recorded by an official scribe.]] Based on studies of these bronze inscriptions, it is clear that, from the Shang dynasty writing to that of the [[Western Zhou]] and early [[Eastern Zhou]], the mainstream script evolved in a slow, unbroken fashion, until assuming the form that is now known as [[seal script]] in the late Eastern Zhou in the state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]], without any clear line of division.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=59\u2013150}}<ref>Ch\u00e9n Zh\u0101or\u00f3ng 2003.</ref> Meanwhile, other scripts had evolved, especially in the eastern and southern areas during the late [[Zhou dynasty]], including regional forms, such as the ''g\u01d4w\u00e9n'' (\"ancient forms\") of the eastern [[Warring States]] preserved as variant forms in the [[Han dynasty]] character dictionary ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', as well as decorative forms such as [[Bird-worm seal script|bird and insect scripts]].\n\n===Unification: seal script, vulgar writing and proto-clerical===\n{{Calligraphy}}\n[[Seal script]], which had evolved slowly in the state of Qin during the Eastern [[Zhou dynasty]], became standardized and adopted as the formal script for all of China in the [[Qin dynasty]] (leading to a popular misconception that it was invented at that time), and was still widely used for decorative engraving and [[seal (device)|seals]] (name chops, or signets) in the [[Han dynasty]] period. However, despite the Qin script standardization, more than one script remained in use at the time. For example, a little-known, rectilinear and roughly executed kind of common (vulgar) writing had for centuries coexisted with the more formal seal script in the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]], and the popularity of this vulgar writing grew as the use of writing itself became more widespread.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=104}} By the [[Warring States period]], an immature form of [[clerical script]] called \"early clerical\" or \"proto-clerical\" had already developed in the state of Qin{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=59, 104\u2013107}} based upon this vulgar writing, and with influence from seal script as well.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=119}} The coexistence of the three scripts \u2013 small seal, vulgar and proto-clerical, with the latter evolving gradually in the Qin to early Han dynasties into [[clerical script]] \u2013 runs counter to the traditional belief that the Qin dynasty had one script only, and that clerical script was suddenly invented in the early Han dynasty from the [[small seal script]].\n\n===Han dynasty===\n\n====Proto-clerical evolving to clerical====\nProto-clerical script, which had emerged by the time of the Warring States period from vulgar Qin writing, matured gradually, and by the early Western Han period, it was little different from that of the Qin.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=123}} Recently discovered bamboo slips show the script becoming mature clerical script by the middle-to-late reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu of the Western Han]],{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=119, 123\u2013124}} who ruled from 141 to 87&nbsp;BC.\n\n====Clerical and clerical cursive====\nContrary to the popular belief of there being only one script per period, there were in fact multiple scripts in use during the Han period.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=130}} Although mature [[clerical script]], also called {{Lang|zh|\u516b\u5206}} (b\u0101f\u0113n){{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=121}} script, was dominant at that time, an early type of [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]] was also in use by the Han by at least as early as 24&nbsp;BC (during the very late Western Han period),{{efn|{{harvnb|Qiu|2000|pp=132\u2013133}} provides archaeological evidence for this dating, in contrast to unsubstantiated claims dating the beginning of cursive anywhere from the Qin to the Eastern Han.}} incorporating cursive forms popular at the time, well as many elements from the vulgar writing of the [[Qin (state)|Warring State of Qin]].{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=131, 133}} By around the time of the Eastern [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], this Han cursive became known as {{Lang|zh|\u7ae0\u8349}} ''zh\u0101ngc\u01ceo'' (also known as {{zh|s=\u96b6\u8349|labels=no}} / {{zh|t=\u96b8\u8349|labels=no}} ''l\u00ecc\u01ceo'' today), or in English sometimes clerical cursive, ancient cursive, or draft cursive. Some believe that the name, based on {{Lang|zh|\u7ae0}} ''zh\u0101ng'' meaning \"orderly\", arose because the script was a more orderly form{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=138}} of cursive than [[Cursive script (East Asia)|the modern form]], which emerged during the Eastern [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] and is still in use today, called {{Lang|zh|\u4eca\u8349}} ''j\u012bnc\u01ceo'' or \"modern cursive\".{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=131}}\n\n====Neo-clerical====\nAround the mid-[[Eastern Han]] period,{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=138}} a simplified and easier-to-write form of clerical script appeared, which Qiu terms \"neo-clerical\" ({{Lang|zh|\u65b0\u96b6\u4f53}} / {{Lang|zh|\u65b0\u96b8\u9ad4}}, ''x\u012bnl\u00ect\u01d0'').{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=113, 139}} By the late Eastern Han, this had become the dominant daily script,{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=138}} although the formal, mature ''b\u0101f\u0113n'' ({{Lang|zh|\u516b\u5206}}) clerical script remained in use for formal works such as engraved [[stelae]].{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=138}} Qiu describes this neo-clerical script as a transition between clerical and regular script,{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=138}} and it remained in use through the [[Cao Wei]] and [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasties]].{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=139}}\n\n====Semi-cursive====\nBy the late Eastern Han period, an early form of [[semi-cursive script]] appeared,{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=113, 139}} developing out of a cursively written form of neo-clerical script{{efn|{{harvnb|Qiu|2000|pp=140\u2013141}} mentions examples of neo-clerical with \"strong overtones of cursive script\" from the late Eastern Han.}} and simple cursive.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=142}} This semi-cursive script was traditionally attributed to Liu Desheng c. 147\u2013188&nbsp;AD,{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=139}}{{efn|Liu is said to have taught [[Zhong Yao]] and [[Wang Xizhi]].}} although such attributions refer to early masters of a script rather than to their actual inventors, since the scripts generally evolved into being over time.

Retrieved 2010-05-22.</ref> postulate that one person alone could not have developed a new script which was universally adopted, but could only have been a contributor to its gradual formation. The earliest surviving pieces written in regular script are copies of Zhong Yao's works, including at least one copied by [[Wang Xizhi]]. This new script, which is the dominant modern Chinese script, developed out of a neatly written form of early semi-cursive, with addition of the pause ({{zh|s=\u987f|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=\u9813|labels=no}} ''d\u00f9n'') technique to end horizontal strokes, plus heavy tails on strokes which are written to the downward-right diagonal.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=143}} Thus, early regular script emerged from a neat, formal form of semi-cursive,  which had itself emerged from neo-clerical (a simplified, convenient form of clerical script). It then matured further in the Eastern [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] in the hands of the \"Sage of Calligraphy\", [[Wang Xizhi]], and his son [[Wang Xianzhi (calligrapher)|Wang Xianzhi]]. It was not, however, in widespread use at that time, and most writers continued using neo-clerical, or a somewhat semi-cursive form of it, for daily writing,{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=143}} while the conservative bafen clerical script remained in use on some stelae, alongside some semi-cursive, but primarily neo-clerical.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=144}}\n\n====Modern cursive====\nMeanwhile, modern cursive script slowly emerged from the clerical cursive (''zh\u0101ngc\u01ceo'') script during the Cao Wei to Jin period, under the influence of both semi-cursive and the newly emerged regular script.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=148}} Cursive was formalized in the hands of a few master calligraphers, the most famous and influential of whom was [[Wang Xizhi]].{{efn|W\u00e1ng X\u012bzh\u012b is so credited in essays by other calligraphers in the 6th to early 7th centuries, and most of his extant pieces are in modern cursive script.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=148}}}}\n\n===Dominance and maturation of regular script===\nIt was not until the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] that regular script rose to dominant status.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=145}} During that period, regular script continued evolving stylistically, reaching full maturity in the early [[Tang dynasty]]. Some call the writing of the early Tang calligrapher [[Ouyang Xun]] (557\u2013641) the first mature regular script. After this point, although developments in the art of calligraphy and in character simplification still lay ahead, there were no more major stages of evolution for the mainstream script.\n\n===Modern history===\nAlthough most of the simplified Chinese characters in use today are the result of the works moderated by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] in the 1950s and 60s, character simplification predates the republic's formation in 1949.\nOne of the earliest proponents of character simplification was [[Lufei Kui]], who proposed in 1909 that simplified characters should be used in education. In the years following the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919, many anti-imperialist Chinese intellectuals sought ways to modernise China. In the 1930s and 1940s, discussions on character simplification took place within the [[Kuomintang]] government, and many Chinese intellectuals and writers have long maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in China. In many world languages, literacy has been promoted as a justification for [[spelling reform]]s. The People's Republic of China issued its first round of official character simplifications in two documents, the first in 1956 and the second in 1964. In the 1950s and 1960s, while confusion about simplified characters was still rampant, transitional characters that mixed simplified parts with yet-to-be simplified parts of characters together appeared briefly, then disappeared.\n\n\"[[Han unification]]\" was an effort by the authors of Unicode and the Universal Character Set to map multiple character sets of the so-called CJK languages (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) into a single set of unified characters and was completed for the purposes of [[Unicode]] in 1991 (Unicode&nbsp;1.0).\n\nApart from Chinese ones, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese normative medium of record-keeping, written historical narratives and official communication are in adaptations and variations of Chinese script.<ref>\"...East Asia had been among the \ufb01rst regions of the world to produce written records of the past. Well into modern times Chinese script, the common script across East Asia, served\u2014with local adaptations and variations\u2014as the normative medium of record-keeping and written historical narrative, as well as of\ufb01cial communication. This was true, not only in China itself, but in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.\" The Oxford History of Historical Writing. Volume 3.

[[Inariyama Sword]]}}\n\nChinese characters were first used in Vietnam during the [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|millennium of Chinese rule]] starting in 111&nbsp;BC. They were used to write Classical Chinese and adapted around the 13th century to create the [[Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m|N\u00f4m]] script to write Vietnamese.\n\nCurrently, the only non-Chinese language outside of China that regularly uses the Chinese script is Japanese. Vietnam abandoned their use in the early 20th&nbsp;century in favour of a Latin-based script, and Korea in the late 20th century in favour of its homegrown [[hangul]] script, although as Korea switched much more recently, many Koreans still learn them to read texts written before then, or in some cases to disambiguate homophones.{{Citation Needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Japanese===\n{{Main|Kanji}}\nChinese characters adapted to write [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words are known as [[kanji]]. Chinese words borrowed into Japanese could be written with Chinese characters, while native Japanese words could also be written using the character(s) for a Chinese word of similar meaning. Most kanji have both the native (and often multi-syllabic) Japanese pronunciation, known as kun'yomi, and the (mono-syllabic) Chinese-based pronunciation, known as on'yomi. For example, the native Japanese word ''katana'' is written as {{Nihongo2|\u5200}} in kanji, which uses the native pronunciation since the word is native to Japanese, while the Chinese loanword ''nihont\u014d'' (meaning \"Japanese sword\") is written as {{Nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c\u5200}}, which uses the Chinese-based pronunciation. While nowadays loanwords from non-Sinosphere languages are usually just written in [[katakana]], one of the two syllabary systems of Japanese, loanwords that were borrowed into Japanese before the Meiji Period were typically written with Chinese characters whose on'yomi had the same pronunciation as the loanword itself, words like ''Amerika'' (kanji: {{Nihongo2|\u4e9c\u7c73\u5229\u52a0}}, katakana: {{Nihongo2|\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab}}, meaning: America), ''karuta'' (kanji: {{Nihongo2|\u6b4c\u7559\u591a}}, {{Nihongo2|\u52a0\u7559\u591a}}, katakana: {{Nihongo2|\u30ab\u30eb\u30bf}}, meaning: card, letter), and ''tempura'' (kanji: {{Nihongo2|\u5929\u5a66\u7f85}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5929\u9ea9\u7f85}}, katakana: {{Nihongo2|\u30c6\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9}}, meaning: tempura), although the meanings of the characters used often had no relation to the words themselves. Kanji that are used to only represent the sounds of a word are called [[ateji]]. While foreign loanwords in Japanese words are usually written only in kana, there are some words that normally use ateji to this day, like ''kurabu'' (ateji: {{Nihongo2|\u4ff1\u697d\u90e8}}, katakana: {{Nihongo2|\u30af\u30e9\u30d6}}, meaning: club) and ''sushi'' (ateji: {{Nihongo2|\u5bff\u53f8}}, katakana: {{Nihongo2|\u30b9\u30b7}}).\nBecause there have been multiple layers of borrowing into Japanese, a single character may have several readings in Japanese.{{sfn|Coulmas|1991|pp=122\u2013129}}\n\nWritten Japanese also includes a pair of [[syllabary|syllabaries]] known as [[kana]], derived by simplifying Chinese characters selected to represent syllables of Japanese.\nThe syllabaries differ because they sometimes selected different characters for a syllable, and because they used different strategies to reduce these characters for easy writing: the angular [[katakana]] were obtained by selecting a part of each character, while [[hiragana]] were derived from the cursive forms of whole characters.{{sfn|Coulmas|1991|pp=129\u2013132}}\nModern Japanese writing uses a composite system, using kanji for [[word stem]]s, hiragana for inflexional endings and grammatical words, and katakana to transcribe non-Chinese loanwords as well as serve as a method to emphasize native words (similar to how italics are used in Romance languages).{{sfn|Coulmas|1991|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\n===Korean===\n{{Main|Hanja}}\n\nIn times past, until the 15th century, in Korea, Literary Chinese was the dominant form of written communication prior to the creation of [[hangul]], the Korean alphabet. Much of the vocabulary, especially in the realms of science and sociology, comes directly from Chinese, comparable to Latin or Greek root words in European languages. However, due to the lack of tones in Modern Standard Korean,{{sfn|Ito & Kenstowicz|2017}}  as the words were imported from Chinese, many dissimilar characters and syllables took on identical pronunciations, and subsequently identical spelling in hangul.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  Chinese characters are sometimes used to this day for either clarification in a practical manner, or to give a distinguished appearance, as knowledge of Chinese characters is considered by many Koreans a high class attribute and an indispensable part of a classical education.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It is also observed that the preference for Chinese characters is treated as being conservative and Confucian.\n\nIn South Korea, ''[[hanja]]'' have become a politically contentious issue, with some urging a [[Linguistic purism in Korean|\"purification\" of the national language]] and culture by  abandoning their use. Efforts to re-extend Hanja education to elementary schools in the 2015 were met with generally negative reaction from the public and from teachers' organizations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yoon |first1=Min-sik |title=\u2018Hanja\u2019 education in elementary schools stirs dispute |url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150921001084 |accessdate=26 March 2020 |work=The Korea Herald |date=21 September 2015 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn South Korea, educational policy on characters has swung back and forth, often swayed by education ministers' personal opinions. At present, middle and high school students (grades 7 to 12) are taught 1,800 characters,{{sfnp|Hannas|1997|pp=68\u201372}} albeit with the principal focus on recognition, with the aim of achieving newspaper literacy.\n\nThere is a clear trend toward the exclusive use of hangul in day-to-day South Korean society. Hanja are still used to some extent, particularly in newspapers, weddings, place names and [[calligraphy]] (although it is nowhere near the extent of kanji use in day-to-day Japanese society). Hanja is also extensively used in situations where ambiguity must be avoided,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} such as academic papers, high-level corporate reports, government documents, and newspapers; this is due to the large number of [[homonyms]] that have resulted from [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|extensive borrowing]] of Chinese words.\n\nThe issue of ambiguity is the main hurdle in any effort to \"cleanse\" the Korean language of Chinese characters.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Characters convey meaning visually, while alphabets convey guidance to pronunciation, which in turn hints at meaning. As an example, in Korean dictionaries, the phonetic entry for {{Lang|ko|\uae30\uc0ac}} ''gisa'' yields more than 30 different entries. In the past, this ambiguity had been efficiently resolved by parenthetically displaying the associated hanja. While hanja is sometimes used for Sino-Korean vocabulary, native Korean words are rarely, if ever, written in hanja.\n\nWhen learning how to write hanja, students are taught to memorize the native Korean pronunciation for the hanja's meaning and the Sino-Korean pronunciations (the pronunciation based on the Chinese pronunciation of the characters) for each hanja respectively so that students know what the syllable and meaning is for a particular hanja. For example, the name for the hanja {{Lang|ko|\u6c34}} is {{Lang|ko|\ubb3c}} {{Lang|ko|\uc218}} (mul-su) in which {{Lang|ko|\ubb3c}} (mul) is the native Korean pronunciation for \"water\", while {{Lang|ko|\uc218}} (su) is the Sino-Korean pronunciation of the character. The naming of hanja is similar to if \"water\" were named \"water-aqua\", \"horse-equus\", or \"gold-aurum\" based on a hybridization of both the English and the Latin names. Other examples include {{Lang|ko|\uc0ac\ub78c}} {{Lang|ko|\uc778}} (saram-in) for {{Lang|ko|\u4eba}} \"person/people\", {{Lang|ko|\ud070}} {{Lang|ko|\ub300}} (keun-dae) for {{Lang|ko|\u5927}} \"big/large//great\", {{Lang|ko|\uc791\uc744}} {{Lang|ko|\uc18c}} (jakeul-so) for {{Lang|ko|\u5c0f}} \"small/little\", {{Lang|ko|\uc544\ub798}} {{Lang|ko|\ud558}} (arae-ha) for {{Lang|ko|\u4e0b}} \"underneath/below/low\", {{Lang|ko|\uc544\ube44}} {{Lang|ko|\ubd80}} (abi-bu) for {{Lang|ko|\u7236}} \"father\", and {{Lang|ko|\ub098\ub77c\uc774\ub984}} {{Lang|ko|\ud55c}} (naraireum-han) for {{Lang|ko|\u97d3}} \"Han/Korea\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howtostudykorean.com/hanja-unit-1-lessons-1-20/hanja-lesson-1/|title=Hanja Lesson 1: \u5927, \u5c0f, \u4e2d, \u5c71, \u9580 {{!}} How to study Korean|website=www.howtostudykorean.com|access-date=2016-03-09}}</ref>\n\nIn North Korea, the [[hanja]] system was once completely banned since June 1949 due to fears of collapsed containment of the country; during the 1950s, [[Kim Il Sung]] had condemned all sorts of foreign languages (even the newly proposed [[New Korean Orthography]]). The ban continued into the 21st century. However, a textbook for university history departments containing 3,323 distinct characters was published in 1971.  In the 1990s, school children were still expected to learn 2,000 characters (more than in South Korea or Japan).{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=68}}\n\nAfter [[Kim Jong Il]], the second ruler of North Korea, died in December 2011, [[Kim Jong Un]] stepped up and began mandating the use of Hanja as a source of definition for the Korean language. Currently, it is said that North Korea teaches around 3,000 Hanja characters to North Korean students, and in some cases, the characters appear within advertisements and newspapers. However, it is also said that the authorities implore students not to use the characters in public.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ko:\ubd81\ud55c\uc758 \ud55c\uc790\uc815\ucc45 \u2013 \"\u6f22\u5b57, 3000\uc790\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub418 \uc4f0\uc9c0\ub294 \ub9d0\ub77c\"|url=http://hanmunlove.nazero.net/bbs/zboard.php?id=hanmun5&page=12&sn1=&divpage=1&sn=off&ss=on&sc=on&select_arrange=headnum&desc=asc&no=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217174225/http://hanmunlove.nazero.net/bbs/zboard.php?id=hanmun5&page=12&sn1=&divpage=1&sn=off&ss=on&sc=on&select_arrange=headnum&desc=asc&no=4|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-12-17|date=2001-06-04|website=Han Mun Love|publisher=[[Chosun Ilbo]]|author=Kim Hye-jin|title = 404 Not Found|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref> Due to North Korea's strict isolationism, accurate reports about hanja use in North Korea are hard to obtain.\n\n===Okinawan===\n{{Main|Okinawan language}}\nChinese characters are thought to have been first introduced to the [[Ryukyu Islands]] in 1265 by a Japanese Buddhist monk.<ref>Hung, Eva and Judy Wakabayashi.

Until the early 20th century, [[Literary Chinese]] was used in Vietnam for all official and scholarly writing. Around the 13th century the ''N\u00f4m'' script was developed to record folk literature in the Vietnamese language. The script used Chinese characters to represent both borrowed [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] and native words with similar pronunciation or meaning. In addition thousands of new compound characters were created to write Vietnamese words.

Most notably, the only surviving copies of ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'' were written in such a manner; the Chinese characters {{Lang|zh|\u5fd9\u8c41\u4f96\u7d10\u5bdf \u812b[\u535c]\u5bdf\u5b89}} is the rendering of ''Mong\u03b3ol-un ni\u03b3uca tob\u010diyan'', the title in Mongolian.\n\nHanzi was also used to phonetically transcribe the [[Manchu language]] in the [[Qing dynasty]].\n\nAccording to the Rev. John Gulick:  \"The inhabitants of other Asiatic nations, who have had occasion to represent the words of their several languages by Chinese characters, have as a rule used unaspirated characters for the sounds, g, d, b. The Muslims from Arabia and Persia have followed this method \u2026 The Mongols, Manchu, and Japanese also constantly select unaspirated characters to represent the sounds g, d, b, and j of their languages. These surrounding Asiatic nations, in writing Chinese words in their own alphabets, have uniformly used g, d, b, etc., to represent the unaspirated sounds.\"<ref>Rev. John Gulick (November 1870) [https://books.google.com/books?id=PcELAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA153#v=onepage&q&f=false \"On the best method of representing the unaspirated mutes of the Mandarin dialect,\"] ''The Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal'', vol. 3, pp. 153\u2013155.</ref>\n\n==Simplification==\n{{Main|Simplified Chinese character|Japanese script reform}}\nChinese character simplification is the overall<!--Overall. \u5f37\u5f3a, \u6b65\u6b69.--> reduction of the number of strokes in the [[regular script]] of a set of Chinese characters.\n\n===Simplification in China===\nThe use of traditional Chinese characters versus simplified Chinese characters varies greatly, and can depend on both the local customs and the medium. Before the official reform, character simplifications were not officially sanctioned and generally adopted vulgar variants and idiosyncratic substitutions. [[Vulgar variant|Orthodox variants]] were mandatory in printed works, while the (unofficial) simplified characters would be used in everyday writing or quick notes. Since the 1950s, and especially with the publication of the 1964 list, the [[People's Republic of China]] has officially adopted [[simplified Chinese characters]] for use in [[mainland China]], while [[Hong Kong]], Macau, and the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) were not affected by the reform. There is no absolute rule for using either system, and often it is determined by what the target audience understands, as well as the upbringing of the writer.\n\nAlthough most often associated with the People's Republic of China, character simplification predates the 1949 communist victory. [[Caoshu]], cursive written text, almost always includes character simplification, and simplified forms have always existed in print, albeit not for the most formal works. In the 1930s and 1940s, discussions on character simplification took place within the [[Kuomintang]] government, and a large number of Chinese intellectuals and writers have long maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in China. Indeed, this desire by the Kuomintang to simplify the Chinese writing system (inherited and implemented by the [[Communist Party of China]]) also nursed aspirations of some for the adoption of a phonetic script based on the [[Latin script]], and spawned such inventions as the [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]].\n\nThe People's Republic of China issued its first round of official character simplifications in two documents, the first in 1956 and the second in 1964. A [[Second-round simplified Chinese character|second round of character simplifications]] (known as ''erjian'', or \"second round simplified characters\") was promulgated in 1977. It was poorly received, and in 1986 the authorities rescinded the second round completely, while making six revisions to the 1964 list, including the restoration of three traditional characters that had been simplified: {{Lang|zh|\u53e0}} ''di\u00e9'', {{Lang|zh|\u8986}} ''f\u00f9'', {{Lang|zh|\u50cf}} ''xi\u00e0ng''.\n\nThe majority of simplified characters are drawn from conventional abbreviated forms, or ancient standard forms.{{sfn|Ramsey|1987|p=147}} For example, the orthodox character {{Lang|zh|\u4f86}} ''l\u00e1i'' (\"come\") was written with the structure {{Lang|zh|\u6765}} in the [[clerical script]] ({{Lang|zh|\u96b6\u4e66}} / {{Lang|zh|\u96b8\u66f8}}, ''l\u00ecsh\u016b'') of the [[Han dynasty]]. This clerical form uses one fewer stroke, and was thus adopted as a simplified form. The character {{Lang|zh|\u96f2}} ''y\u00fan'' (\"cloud\") was written with the structure {{Lang|zh|\u4e91}} in the [[oracle bone script]] of the [[Shang dynasty]], and had remained in use later as a phonetic loan in the meaning of \"to say\" while the {{Lang|zh|\u96e8}} [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] was added to differentiate meanings. The simplified form adopts the original structure.\n\n===Simplification in Japan===\n{{Main|Kanji|T\u014dy\u014d kanji|J\u014dy\u014d kanji|Shinjitai}}\n\nIn the years after [[World War II]], the [[Japanese government]] also instituted a series of orthographic reforms. Some characters were given simplified forms called {{nihongo||\u65b0\u5b57\u4f53|[[shinjitai]]|lit. \"new character forms\"}}; the older forms were then labelled the {{nihongo4||\u65e7\u5b57\u4f53|[[ky\u016bjitai]]|lit. \"old character forms\"}}. The number of characters in common use was restricted, and formal lists of characters to be learned during each grade of school were established, first the 1850-character {{nihongo4||\u5f53\u7528\u6f22\u5b57|[[t\u014dy\u014d kanji]]}} list in 1945, the 1945-character {{nihongo4||\u5e38\u7528\u6f22\u5b57|[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]}} list in 1981, and a 2136-character reformed version of the ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji'' in 2010. Many variant forms of characters and obscure alternatives for common characters were officially discouraged. This was done with the goal of facilitating learning for children and simplifying kanji use in literature and periodicals. These are simply guidelines, hence many characters outside these standards are still widely known and commonly used, especially those used for personal and place names (for the latter, see [[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]]),{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} as well as for some common words such as {{nihongo4|\"dragon\"|\u7adc/\u9f8d|tatsu}} in which both old and new forms of the character are both acceptable and widely known amongst native Japanese speakers.\n\n===Southeast Asian Chinese communities===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\n[[Singapore]] underwent three successive rounds of character simplification. These resulted in some simplifications that differed from those used in [[mainland China]]. It ultimately adopted the reforms of the People's Republic of China in their entirety as official, and has implemented them in the [[Education in Singapore|educational system]]. However, unlike in China, personal names may still be registered in traditional characters.\n\n[[Malaysia]] started teaching a set of simplified characters at schools in 1981, which were also completely identical to the Mainland China simplifications. Chinese newspapers in Malaysia are published in either set of characters, typically with the headlines in traditional Chinese while the body is in simplified Chinese.\n\nAlthough in both countries the use of simplified characters is universal among the younger Chinese generation, a large majority of the older Chinese literate generation still use the traditional characters. Chinese shop signs are also generally written in traditional characters.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], most Chinese schools and businesses still use the traditional characters and [[bopomofo]], owing from influence from the Republic of China (Taiwan) due to the shared [[Hokkien]] heritage. Recently, however, more Chinese schools now use both simplified characters and [[pinyin]]. Since most readers of Chinese newspapers in the Philippines belong to the older generation, they are still published largely using traditional characters.\n\n===North America===\nPublic and private Chinese signage in the United States and Canada most often use traditional characters.<ref>{{cite web |author= Vanessa Hua |url= http://m.sfgate.com/education/article/For-students-of-Chinese-politics-fill-the-2518868.php |title= For students of Chinese, politics fill the characters / Traditionalists bemoan rise of simplified writing system promoted by Communist government to improve literacy |publisher= M.sfgate.com |date= 2006-05-08 |accessdate= 2018-02-28}}</ref> There is some effort to get municipal governments to implement more simplified character signage due to recent immigration from mainland China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atanet.org/chronicle-online/wp-content/uploads/4111_20_mathew_kane.pdf |title=Chinese Character Usage in New York City |date= |accessdate=2019-07-22}}</ref> Most community newspapers printed in North America are also printed in traditional characters.\n\n===Comparisons of traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, and Japanese===\nThe following is a comparison of Chinese characters in the ''[[Standard Form of National Characters]]'', a common [[traditional Chinese]] standard used in Taiwan, the ''[[Table of General Standard Chinese Characters]]'', the standard for Mainland Chinese [[simplified Chinese|''jiantizi'']] (simplified), and the ''[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]'', the standard for Japanese [[kanji]]. Generally, the ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji'' are more similar to ''fantizi'' (traditional) than ''jiantizi''  are to ''fantizi''. \"Simplified\" refers to having significant differences from the Taiwan standard, not necessarily being a newly created character or a newly performed substitution. The characters in the [[List of Forms of Frequently Used Characters|Hong Kong standard]] and the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] are also known as \"Traditional,\" but are not shown.\n{{Chinese characters simplifications}}\n\n==Written styles==\n{{Main|Chinese script styles}}\n[[File:Treatise On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|right|Sample of the cursive script by Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] calligrapher [[Sun Guoting]], c. 650&nbsp;AD]]\n\nThere are numerous styles, or scripts, in which Chinese characters can be written, deriving from various calligraphic and historical models. Most of these originated in China and are now common, with minor variations, in all countries where Chinese characters are used.\n\nThe [[Shang dynasty]] [[oracle bone script]] and the [[Zhou dynasty]] scripts found on [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]] are no longer used; the oldest script that is still in use today is the [[Seal Script]] ({{zh|t=\u7bc6\u66f8|labels=no}}({{zh|s=\u7bc6\u4e66|labels=no}}), ''zhu\u00e0nsh\u016b''). It evolved organically out of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] Zhou script, and was adopted in a standardized form under the first [[Emperor of China]], [[Qin Shi Huang]]. The seal script, as the name suggests, is now used only in artistic seals. Few people are still able to read it effortlessly today, although the art of carving a traditional seal in the script remains alive; some [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphers]] also work in this style.\n\nScripts that are still used regularly are the \"[[Clerical Script]]\" ({{zh|t=\u96b8\u66f8|labels=no}}({{zh|s=\u96b6\u4e66|labels=no}}), ''l\u00ecsh\u016b'') of the [[Qin dynasty]] to the [[Han dynasty]], the [[Wei Monumental Script|Weibei]] ({{zh|t=\u9b4f\u7891|labels=no}}, ''w\u00e8ib\u0113i''), the \"[[Regular Script]]\" ({{zh|t=\u6977\u66f8|labels=no}}({{zh|s=\u6977\u4e66|labels=no}}), ''k\u01ceish\u016b''), which is used mostly for printing, and the \"[[Semi-cursive Script]]\" ({{zh|t=\u884c\u66f8|labels=no}}({{zh|s=\u884c\u4e66|labels=no}}), ''x\u00edngsh\u016b''), used mostly for handwriting.\n\nThe [[cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]] ({{zh|t=\u8349\u66f8|labels=no}}({{zh|s=\u8349\u4e66|labels=no}}), ''c\u01ceosh\u016b'', literally \"grass script\") is used informally. The basic character shapes are suggested, rather than explicitly realized, and the abbreviations are sometimes extreme. Despite being cursive to the point where individual strokes are no longer differentiable and the characters often illegible to the untrained eye, this script (also known as ''draft'') is highly revered for the beauty and freedom that it embodies. Some of the [[simplified Chinese characters]] adopted by the [[People's Republic of China]], and some simplified characters used in Japan, are derived from the cursive script. The Japanese ''[[hiragana]]'' script is also derived from this script.\n\nThere also exist scripts created outside China, such as the Japanese ''[[Edomoji]]'' styles; these have tended to remain restricted to their countries of origin, rather than spreading to other countries like the Chinese scripts.\n\n===Calligraphy===\n{{Main|Chinese calligraphy}}\n[[File:This Letter written by Mi Fei.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese calligraphy of mixed styles written by [[Song dynasty]] (1051\u20131108&nbsp;AD) poet [[Mi Fu|Mifu]]. For centuries, the Chinese literati were expected to master the art of calligraphy.]]\n\nThe art of writing Chinese characters is called '''Chinese calligraphy'''. It is usually done with [[ink brushes]]. In ancient China, Chinese calligraphy is one of the [[Four Arts of the Chinese Scholars]]. There is a minimalist set of rules of Chinese calligraphy. Every character from the Chinese scripts is built into a uniform shape by means of assigning it a geometric area in which the character must occur. Each character has a set number of brushstrokes; none must be added or taken away from the character to enhance it visually, lest the meaning be lost. Finally, strict regularity is not required, meaning the strokes may be accentuated for dramatic effect of individual style. Calligraphy was the means by which scholars could mark their thoughts and teachings for immortality, and as such, represent some of the most precious treasures that can be found from ancient China.\n\n===Typography and design===\n[[File:\u9f4a\u66f811.jpg|thumb|A page from a [[Ming dynasty]] edition of the [[Book of Qi]] ]]\n[[File:Chenzihmyon typefaces.svg|thumb|The first four characters of ''[[Thousand Character Classic]]'' in different type and [[Chinese script styles|script]] styles. From right to left: [[seal script]], [[clerical script]], [[regular script]], [[Ming (typeface)|Ming]] and [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|sans-serif]].]]\n[[File:\u6d59\u6c5f\u59d3\u89e31.jpeg|thumb|A page from a [[Song dynasty]] publication in a [[regular script]] typeface which resembles the handwriting of [[Ouyang Xun]] ]]\n\nThere are three major families of typefaces used in Chinese typography:\n* [[Ming (typeface)|Song/Ming]]\n* [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|Sans-serif]]\n* [[Regular script]]\n\nMing and sans-serif are the most popular in [[body text]] and are based on regular script for Chinese characters akin to Western [[serif]] and [[sans-serif]] typefaces, respectively. Regular script typefaces emulate [[regular script]].\n\nThe [[Ming (typeface)|''Song'' typeface]] ({{zh|s=\u5b8b\u4f53|labels=no}} / {{zh|t=\u5b8b\u9ad4|labels=no}}, ''s\u00f2ngt\u01d0'') is known as the ''Ming'' typeface ({{Nihongo2|\u660e\u671d}}, ''minch\u014d'') in Japan, and it is also somewhat more commonly known as the ''Ming'' typeface ({{zh|s=\u660e\u4f53|labels=no}} / {{zh|t=\u660e\u9ad4|labels=no}}, ''m\u00edngt\u01d0'') than the ''Song'' typeface in [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]]. The names of these styles come from the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, when [[block printing]] flourished in China.\n\n[[East Asian sans-serif typeface|Sans-serif]] typefaces, called black typeface ({{zh|s=\u9ed1\u4f53|labels=no}} / {{zh|t=\u9ed1\u9ad4|labels=no}}, ''h\u0113it\u01d0'') in Chinese and Gothic typeface ({{Nihongo2|\u30b4\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u4f53}}) in Japanese, are characterized by simple lines of even thickness for each stroke, akin to sans-serif styles such as [[Arial]] and [[Helvetica]] in Western typography.\n\n[[Regular script]] typefaces are also commonly used, but not as common as Ming or sans-serif typefaces for body text. Regular script typefaces are often used to teach students Chinese characters, and often aim to match the standard forms of the region where they are meant to be used. Most typefaces in the [[Song dynasty]] were regular script typefaces which resembled a particular person's handwriting (e.g. the handwriting of [[Ouyang Xun]], [[Yan Zhenqing]], or [[Liu Gongquan]]), while most modern regular script typefaces tend toward anonymity and regularity.\n\n==Variants==\n{{Main|Variant Chinese character}}\n[[File:Variations of the 213th Chinese radical, gui 'tortoise'.png|thumb|Variants of the Chinese character for ''gu\u012b'' 'turtle', collected c. 1800 from printed sources. The one at left is the traditional form used today in Taiwan and Hong Kong, {{zh|t=\u9f9c|labels=no}}, though {{zh|t=\u9f9c|labels=no}} may look slightly different, or even like the second variant from the left, depending on your font (see [[wikt:\u9f9c|Wiktionary]]). The modern simplified forms used in China, {{zh|s=\u9f9f|labels=no}}, and in Japan, {{Nihongo2|\u4e80}}, are most similar to the variant in the middle of the bottom row, though neither is identical. A few more closely resemble the modern simplified form of the character for ''di\u00e0n'' 'lightning', {{Lang|zh|\u7535}}.]]\n[[File:Four variant Chinese characters.png|thumb|Five of the 30 variant characters found in the preface of the ''Imperial (Kangxi) Dictionary'' which are not found in the dictionary itself. They are {{Lang|zh|\u70ba}} ({{Lang|zh|\u7232}}) ''w\u00e8i'' \"due to\", {{Lang|zh|\u6b64}} ''c\u01d0'' \"this\", {{Lang|zh|\u6240}} ''su\u01d2'' \"place\", {{Lang|zh|\u80fd}} ''n\u00e9ng'' \"be able to\", {{Lang|zh|\u517c}} ''ji\u0101n'' \"concurrently\". (Although the form of {{Lang|zh|\u70ba}} is not very different, and in fact is used today in Japan, the radical {{Lang|zh|\u722a}} has been obliterated.) Another variant from the preface, {{Lang|zh|\u6765}} for {{Lang|zh|\u4f86}} ''l\u00e1i'' \"to come\", also not listed in the dictionary, has been adopted as the standard in Mainland China and Japan.]]\n[[File:CJK variant glyphs.png|right|thumb|The character {{Lang|zh|\u6b21}} in [[Simplified Chinese character|Simplified]] and [[Traditional Chinese character|Traditional]] Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. If you have an appropriate font installed, you can see the corresponding character in Vietnamese: <big>{{vi-nom|\u6b21}}</big>.]]\nJust as [[Roman letter]]s have a characteristic shape (lower-case letters mostly occupying the [[x-height]], with ascenders or descenders on some letters), Chinese characters occupy a more or less square area in which the components of every character are written to fit in order to maintain a uniform size and shape, especially with small printed characters in [[Ming (typeface)|Ming]] and [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|sans-serif]] styles. Because of this, beginners often practise writing on squared graph paper, and the Chinese sometimes use the term \"Square-Block Characters\" ({{zh|s=\u65b9\u5757\u5b57|labels=no}} / {{zh|t=\u65b9\u584a\u5b57|labels=no}}, ''f\u0101ngku\u00e0iz\u00ec''), sometimes translated as ''tetragraph'',<ref>{{cite web |title=danger + opportunity \u2260 crisis: How a misunderstanding about Chinese characters has led many astray |last=Mair |first=Victor H. |date=September 2009 |accessdate=August 20, 2010 |url=http://pinyin.info/chinese/crisis.html }}</ref> in reference to Chinese characters.\n\nDespite standardization, some nonstandard forms are commonly used, especially in handwriting. In older sources, even authoritative ones, variant characters are commonplace. For example, in the preface to the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary|Imperial Dictionary]]'', there are 30 variant characters which are not found in the dictionary itself.<ref>Montucci, 1817. ''Urh-ch\u012dh-tsze-t\u00eben-se-y\u012dn-pe-ke\u00e1ou; being a parallel drawn between the two intended Chinese dictionaries; by the Rev. Robert Morrison, and Antonio Montucci, LL. D.''</ref> A few of these are reproduced at right.\n\n===Regional standards===\nThe nature of Chinese characters makes it very easy to produce [[allograph]]s (variants) for many characters, and there have been many efforts at orthographical standardization throughout history. In recent times, the widespread usage of the characters in several nations has prevented any particular system becoming universally adopted and the standard form of many Chinese characters thus varies in different regions.\n\n[[Mainland China]] adopted [[simplified Chinese characters]] in 1956. They are also used in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]. [[Traditional Chinese characters]] are used in [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]]. Postwar Japan has used its own less drastically simplified characters, [[Shinjitai]], since 1946, while [[South Korea]] has limited its use of Chinese characters, and [[Vietnam]] and [[North Korea]] have completely abolished their use in favour of [[Vietnamese alphabet]] and [[Hangul]], respectively.\n\nThe standard character forms of each region are described in:\n* The [[List of Frequently Used Characters in Modern Chinese]] for Mainland China.\n* The [[List of Forms of Frequently Used Characters]] for Hong Kong.\n* The [[Standard Form of National Characters]] for Taiwan.\n* The list of [[J\u014dy\u014d kanji]] for Japan.\n* The [[Han-Han Dae Sajeon]] (''de facto'') for Korea.\n\nIn addition to strictness in character size and shape, Chinese characters are written with very precise rules. The most important rules regard the strokes employed, stroke placement, and [[stroke order]]. Just as each region that uses Chinese characters has standardized character forms, each also has standardized stroke orders, with each standard being different. Most characters can be written with just one correct stroke order, though some words also have many valid stroke orders, which may occasionally result in different stroke counts. Some characters are also written with different stroke orders due to character simplification.\n\n===Polysyllabic morphemes===\nChinese characters are primarily [[morphosyllabic]], meaning that most Chinese [[morpheme]]s are monosyllabic and are written with a single character, though in modern Chinese most ''words'' are disyllabic and dimorphemic, consisting of two syllables, each of which is a morpheme. In modern Chinese 10% of morphemes only occur as part of a given compound. However, a few morphemes are disyllabic, some of them dating back to Classical Chinese.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=8\u20139}} Excluding foreign loan words, these are typically words for plants and small animals. They are usually written with a pair of phono-semantic compound characters sharing a common radical. Examples are {{Lang|zh|\u8774\u8776}} ''h\u00fadi\u00e9'' \"butterfly\" and {{Lang|zh|\u73ca\u745a}} ''sh\u0101nh\u00fa'' \"coral\". Note that the {{Lang|zh|\u8774}} ''h\u00fa'' of ''h\u00fadi\u00e9'' and the {{Lang|zh|\u745a}} ''h\u00fa'' of ''sh\u0101nh\u00fa'' have the same phonetic, {{Lang|zh|\u80e1}}, but different radicals (\"insect\" and \"jade\", respectively). Neither exists as an independent morpheme except as a poetic abbreviation of the disyllabic word.\n\n===Polysyllabic characters===\nIn certain cases compound words and set phrases may be contracted into single characters. Some of these can be considered [[logogram]]s, where characters represent whole words rather than syllable-morphemes, though these are generally instead considered [[Chinese ligature|ligatures]] or abbreviations (similar to [[scribal abbreviations]], such as & for \"et\"), and as non-standard. These do see use, particularly in handwriting or decoration, but also in some cases in print. In Chinese, these ligatures are called ''h\u00e9w\u00e9n'' ({{Lang|zh|[[:zh:\u5408\u6587|\u5408\u6587]]}}), ''h\u00e9sh\u016b'' ({{Lang|zh|\u5408\u66f8}}) or h\u00e9t\u01d0z\u00ec ({{Lang|zh|\u5408\u4f53\u5b57}}), and in the special case of combining two characters, these are known as \"two-syllable Chinese characters\" ({{Lang|zh|\u53cc\u97f3\u8282\u6c49\u5b57}}, {{Lang|zh|\u96d9\u97f3\u7bc0\u6f22\u5b57}}).\n\nA commonly seen example is the [[Double Happiness (calligraphy)|double happiness]] symbol {{Lang|zh|\u56cd}}, formed as a ligature of {{Lang|zh|\u559c\u559c}} and referred to by its disyllabic name ({{zh|s=\u53cc\u559c|t=\u96d9\u559c|p=shu\u0101ngx\u01d0}}). In handwriting, numbers are very frequently squeezed into one space or combined \u2013 common ligatures include {{Lang|zh|\u5eff}} ''ni\u00e0n,'' \"twenty\", normally read as {{Lang|zh|\u4e8c\u5341}} ''\u00e8rsh\u00ed,'' {{Lang|zh|\u5345}} ''s\u00e0,'' \"thirty\", normally read as {{Lang|zh|\u4e09\u5341}} ''s\u0101nsh\u00ed,'' and {{Lang|zh|\u534c}} x\u00ec \"forty\", normally read as {{Lang|zh|\u56db\u5341}} \"s\u00ecsh\u00ed\". Calendars often use numeral ligatures in order to save space;  for example, the \"21st of March\" can be read as {{Lang|zh|\u4e09\u6708\u5eff\u4e00}}''.'' In some cases counters are also merged into one character, such as {{Lang|zh|\u4e03\u5341\u4eba}} ''q\u012bsh\u00ed r\u00e9n'' \"seventy people\". Another common abbreviation is {{Lang|zh|\u95e8}} with a \"T\" written inside it, for {{Lang|zh|\u554f\u984c}}, {{Lang|zh|\u95ee\u9898}}, ''w\u00e8nt\u00ed'' (\"question; problem\"), where the \"T\" is from pinyin for the second syllable ''t\u00ed'' {{Lang|zh|\u9898}}.<ref name=vmair/> Since polysyllabic characters are often non-standard, they are often excluded in character dictionaries.\n\nModern examples particularly include [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|Chinese characters]] for [[SI units]]. In Chinese these units are disyllabic and standardly written with two characters, as {{Lang|zh|\u5398\u7c73}} ''l\u00edm\u01d0'' \"centimeter\" ({{Lang|zh|\u5398}} centi-, {{Lang|zh|\u7c73}} meter) or {{Lang|zh|\u5343\u74e6}} ''qi\u0101nw\u01ce'' \"kilowatt\". However, in the 19th century these were often written via compound characters, pronounced disyllabically, such as {{Lang|zh|\u74e9}} for {{Lang|zh|\u5343\u74e6}} or {{Lang|zh|\u7cce}} for {{Lang|zh|\u5398\u7c73}} \u2013 some of these characters were also used in Japan, where they were pronounced with borrowed European readings instead. These have now fallen out of general use, but are occasionally seen. Less systematic examples include {{Lang|zh|\u5715}} ''t\u00fash\u016bgu\u01cen'' \"library\", a contraction of {{Lang|zh|\u5716\u66f8\u9928}},<ref>2006-04-21, [http://www.stnn.cc/culture/splend/t20060421_196261.html {{Lang|zh|\u201c\u5715\u201d\u5b57\u600e\u4e48\u5ff5\uff1f\u4ec0\u4e48\u610f\u601d\uff1f\u8c01\u9020\u7684\uff1f}}], Singtao Net</ref><ref>2009\u5e7403\u670820\u65e5, [http://news.xinhuanet.com/tw/2009-03/20/content_11038042.htm {{Lang|zh|\u201c\u5715\u201d\u5b57\u5b57\u600e\u4e48\u5ff5\uff1f\u53f0\u6559\u80b2\u90e8\u95e8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\u88ab\u8003\u5012}}], [[Xinhua News Agency]]</ref>\n\nThe use of such contractions is as old as Chinese characters themselves, and they have frequently been found in religious or ritual use. In the Oracle Bone script, personal names, ritual items, and even phrases such as {{Lang|zh|\u53d7\u53c8}}({{Lang|zh|\u7950}}) ''sh\u00f2u y\u00f2u'' \"receive blessings\" are commonly contracted into single characters. A dramatic example is that in medieval manuscripts {{zh|t=\u83e9\u85a9|labels=no}} ''p\u00fas\u00e0'' \"bodhisattva\" (simplified: {{zh|s=\u83e9\u8428|labels=no}}) is sometimes written with a single character formed of a 2\u00d72 grid of four {{Lang|zh|\u5341}} (derived from the grass radical over two {{Lang|zh|\u5341}}).<ref name=vmair>Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3330 \"Polysyllabic characters in Chinese writing\"], ''Language Log'', 2011 August 2</ref> However, for the sake of consistency and standardization, the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] seeks to limit the use of such polysyllabic characters in public writing to ensure that every character only has one syllable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3330|title=Polysyllabic characters in Chinese writing|website=Language Log|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref>\n\nConversely, with the fusion of the diminutive ''-er'' suffix in Mandarin, some monosyllabic words may even be written with two characters, as in {{Lang|zh|\u82b1\u513f}} ''hu\u0101r'' \"flower\", which was formerly disyllabic.\n\nIn most other languages that use the [[Chinese family of scripts]], notably Korean, Vietnamese, and Zhuang, Chinese characters are typically monosyllabic, but in Japanese a single character is generally used to represent a borrowed monosyllabic Chinese morpheme (the ''[[on'yomi]]''), a polysyllabic native Japanese morpheme (the ''[[kun'yomi]]''), or even (in rare cases) a foreign loanword. These uses are completely standard and unexceptional.\n\n===Rare and complex characters===\nOften a character not commonly used (a \"rare\" or \"variant\" character) will appear in a personal or place name in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese (see [[Chinese name]], [[Japanese name]], [[Korean name]], and [[Vietnamese name]], respectively). This has caused problems as many computer encoding systems include only the most common characters and exclude the less often used characters. This is especially a problem for personal names which often contain rare or classical, antiquated characters.\n\nOne man who has encountered this problem is Taiwanese politician [[Yu Shyi-kun]], due to the rarity of the last character in his name. Newspapers have dealt with this problem in varying ways, including using software to combine two existing, similar characters, including a picture of the personality, or, especially as is the case with Yu Shyi-kun, simply substituting a homophone for the rare character in the hope that the reader would be able to make the correct inference. Taiwanese political posters, movie posters etc. will often add the [[bopomofo]] phonetic symbols next to such a character. Japanese newspapers may render such names and words in [[katakana]] instead, and it is accepted practice for people to write names for which they are unsure of the correct kanji in katakana instead.\n\nThere are also some extremely complex characters which have understandably become rather rare. According to [[Jo\u00ebl Bellassen]] (1989), the most complex Chinese character is [[File:Zh\u00e9.svg|25px]]/{{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\ud869\udea5|\ud869\udea5]]}} (U+2A6A5) ''zh\u00e9'' {{Audio|zh-zhe2.ogg|listen}}, meaning \"verbose\" and containing sixty-four strokes; this character fell from use around the 5th century. It might be argued, however, that while containing the most strokes, it is not necessarily the most complex character (in terms of difficulty), as it simply requires writing the same sixteen-stroke character {{Lang|zh|\u9f8d}} ''l\u00f3ng'' (lit. \"dragon\") four times in the space for one. Another 64-stroke character is [[File:Zh\u00e8ng.svg|25px]]/{{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\ud841\udd3b|\ud841\udd3b]]}} (U+2053B) ''zh\u00e8ng'' composed of {{Lang|zh|\u8208}} ''x\u012bng/x\u00ecng'' (lit. \"flourish\") four times.\n\nOne of the most complex characters found in modern Chinese dictionaries{{efn|[[File:N\u00e0ng.svg|45px]] (U+9F49) ''n\u00e0ng'' is found, for instance, on p. 707 of {{Lang|zh|\u6f22\u82f1\u8fad\u5178(\u4fee\u8a02\u7248)}} ''A Chinese\u2013English Dictionary'', (Revised Edition) Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press, Beijing, 1995. {{ISBN|978-7-5600-0739-7}}.}} is {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u9f49|\u9f49]]}} (U+9F49) (''n\u00e0ng'', {{Audio|zh-nang4.ogg|listen}}, pictured below, middle image), meaning \"snuffle\" (that is, a pronunciation marred by a blocked nose), with \"just\" thirty-six strokes. Another stroke-rich character is \u9750 (''b\u00ecng''), with 39 strokes, meaning the loud noise thunder. However, these are not in common use. The most complex character that can be input using the Microsoft New Phonetic IME 2002a for traditional Chinese is {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u9f98|\u9f98]]}} (''d\u00e1'', \"the appearance of a dragon flying\"). It is composed of the dragon radical represented three times, for a total of 16 \u00d7 3 = 48 strokes. Among the most complex characters in modern dictionaries and also in ''frequent modern use'' are {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u7c72|\u7c72]]}} (''y\u00f9'', \"to implore\"), with 32 strokes; {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u9b31|\u9b31]]}} (''y\u00f9'', \"luxuriant, lush; gloomy\"), with 29 strokes, as in {{Lang|zh|\u6182\u9b31}} (''y\u014duy\u00f9'', \"depressed\"); {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u8c54|\u8c54]]}} (''y\u00e0n'', \"colorful\"), with 28 strokes; and {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u91c1|\u91c1]]}} (''x\u00ecn'', \"quarrel\"), with 25 strokes, as in {{Lang|zh|\u6311\u91c1}} (''ti\u01ceox\u00ecn'', \"to pick a fight\"). Also in occasional modern use is {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u9c7b|\u9c7b]]}} (''xi\u0101n'' \"fresh\"; variant of {{Lang|zh|\u9bae}} ''xi\u0101n'') with 33 strokes.\n\nIn [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]], an 84-stroke ''[[kokuji]]'' exists: [[File:Taito 1.svg|25px]], normally read ''[[Taito (kanji)|taito]]''. It is composed of three \"cloud\" ({{Nihongo2|\u96f2}}) characters on top of the abovementioned triple \"dragon\" character ({{Nihongo2|\u9f98}}). Also meaning \"the appearance of a dragon in flight\", it has been pronounced {{Nihongo2|\u304a\u3068\u3069}} ''otodo'', {{Nihongo2|[[:ja:\u305f\u3044\u3068|\u305f\u3044\u3068]]}} ''taito'', and {{Nihongo2|\u3060\u3044\u3068}} ''daito''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.sanseido-publ.co.jp/wp/2011/02/08/\u6f22\u5b57\u306e\u73fe\u5728\uff1a\u5e7d\u970a\u6587\u5b57\u304b\u3089\u30ad\u30e7\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u6587\u5b57\u3078\uff1f/| script-title =ja:Sanseido Word-Wise Web \uff3b\u4e09\u7701\u5802\u8f9e\u66f8\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\uff3d \u00bb \u6f22\u5b57\u306e\u73fe\u5728\uff1a\u5e7d\u970a\u6587\u5b57\u304b\u3089\u30ad\u30e7\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u6587\u5b57\u3078\uff1f|trans-title=From ghost character to vampire character?|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}</ref> The most elaborate character in the [[j\u014dy\u014d kanji list]] is the 29-stroke {{Nihongo2|\u9b31}}, meaning \"depression\" or \"melancholy\".\n\nThe most complex Chinese character still in use may be{{according to whom|date=March 2012}} ''bi\u00e1ng'' (pictured right, bottom), with 58 strokes, which refers to [[Biang biang noodles]], a type of noodle from [[China]]'s [[Shaanxi]] province.

Characters formed by Chinese principles in other languages include the roughly 1,500 Japanese-made ''[[kokuji]]'' given in the ''[[w:ja:\u56fd\u5b57\u306e\u5b57\u5178|Kokuji no Jiten]],''<ref>Hida & Sugawara, 1990, Tokyodo Shuppan.</ref> the Korean-made [[gukja]], the over 10,000 [[Sawndip]] characters still in use in [[Guangxi]], and the almost 20,000 [[N\u00f4m]] characters formerly used in Vietnam.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} More divergent descendants of Chinese script include [[Tangut script]], which created over 5,000 characters with similar strokes but different formation principles to Chinese characters.\n\nModified radicals and new variants are two common reasons for the ever-increasing number of characters. There are about 300 radicals and 100 are in common use. Creating a new character by modifying the radical is an easy way to disambiguate [[homograph]]s among ''x\u00edngsh\u0113ngz\u00ec'' pictophonetic compounds. This practice began long before the standardization of Chinese script by [[Qin Shi Huang]] and continues to the present day. The traditional 3rd-person pronoun ''t\u0101'' ({{Lang|zh|\u4ed6}} \"he, she, it\"), which is written with the \"person radical\", illustrates modifying significs to form new characters. In modern usage, there is a graphic distinction between ''t\u0101'' ({{Lang|zh|\u5979}} \"she\") with the \"woman radical\", ''t\u0101'' ({{Lang|zh|\u7260}} \"it\") with the \"animal radical\", ''t\u0101'' ({{Lang|zh|\u5b83}} \"it\") with the \"roof radical\", and ''t\u0101'' ({{Lang|zh|\u7942}} \"He\") with the \"deity radical\", One consequence of modifying radicals is the fossilization of rare and obscure variant logographs, some of which are not even used in [[Classical Chinese]]. For instance, ''he'' {{Lang|zh|\u548c}}  \"harmony, peace\", which combines the \"grain radical\" with the \"mouth radical\", has infrequent variants {{Lang|zh|\u548a}} with the radicals reversed and {{Lang|zh|\u9fa2}} with the \"flute radical\".\n\n===Chinese===\n[[File:Cumulative Hanzi frequency.svg|thumb|right|Cumulative frequency of simplified Chinese characters in Modern Chinese text<ref>Da Jun (2004), [http://lingua.mtsu.edu/chinese-computing/ Chinese text computing].</ref>]]\nChinese characters should not be confused with Chinese words, as the majority of modern Chinese words, unlike their [[Old Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]] counterparts, are written with two or more characters, each character representing one syllable and/or [[morpheme]]. Knowing the meanings of the individual characters of a word will often allow the general meaning of the word to be inferred, but this is not always the case.\n\nStudies in China have shown that literate individuals know and use between 3,000 and 4,000 characters.  Specialists in classical literature or history, who would often encounter characters no longer in use, are estimated to have a working vocabulary of between 5,000 and 6,000 characters.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=73}}\n\nIn [[China]], which uses [[simplified Chinese characters]], the ''[[Xi\u00e0nd\u00e0i H\u00e0ny\u01d4 Ch\u00e1ngy\u00f2ng Z\u00ecbi\u01ceo]]'' ({{Lang|zh-Hans-CN|\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c49\u8bed\u5e38\u7528\u5b57\u8868}}, Chart of Common Characters of Modern Chinese) lists 2,500 common characters and 1,000 less-than-common characters, while the ''Xi\u00e0nd\u00e0i H\u00e0ny\u01d4 T\u014dngy\u00f2ng Z\u00ecbi\u01ceo'' ({{Lang|zh-Hans-CN|\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c49\u8bed\u901a\u7528\u5b57\u8868}}, Chart of Generally Utilized Characters of Modern Chinese) lists 7,000 characters, including the 3,500 characters already listed above. [[GB2312]], an early version of the national encoding standard used in the [[People's Republic of China]], has 6,763 code points. [[GB18030]], the modern, mandatory standard, has a much higher number. The New [[H\u00e0ny\u01d4 Shu\u01d0p\u00edng K\u01ceosh\u00ec]] ({{Lang|zh-Hans-CN|\u6c49\u8bed\u6c34\u5e73\u8003\u8bd5}}, Chinese Proficiency Test) covers approximately 2,600 characters at its highest level (level six).<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Chinese Proficiency Test?|url=http://help.cucas.edu.cn/index/detail?id=2737|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), which uses [[traditional Chinese characters]], the Ministry of Education's ''Ch\u00e1ngy\u00f2ng Gu\u00f3z\u00ec Bi\u0101ozh\u01d4n Z\u00ect\u01d0 Bi\u01ceo'' ({{Lang|zh-Hant-TW|\u5e38\u7528\u570b\u5b57\u6a19\u6e96\u5b57\u9ad4\u8868}}, Chart of Standard Forms of Common National Characters) lists 4,808 characters; the ''C\u00ec Ch\u00e1ngy\u00f2ng Gu\u00f3z\u00ec Bi\u0101ozh\u01d4n Z\u00ect\u01d0 Bi\u01ceo'' ({{Lang|zh-Hant-TW|\u6b21\u5e38\u7528\u570b\u5b57\u6a19\u6e96\u5b57\u9ad4\u8868}}, Chart of Standard Forms of Less-Than-Common National Characters) lists another 6,341 characters. The ''Chinese Standard Interchange Code'' ([[CNS11643]])\u2014the official national encoding standard\u2014supports 48,027 characters, while the most widely used encoding scheme, [[Big5|BIG-5]], supports only 13,053.\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], which uses [[traditional Chinese characters]], the Education and Manpower Bureau's ''Soengjung Zi Zijing Biu'' ({{Lang|zh-Hant-HK|\u5e38\u7528\u5b57\u5b57\u5f62\u8868}}), intended for use in elementary and junior secondary education, lists a total of 4,759 characters.\n\nIn addition, there are a number of ''dialect characters'' ({{Lang|zh|\u65b9\u8a00\u5b57}}) that are not generally used in formal written Chinese but represent colloquial terms in nonstandard [[varieties of Chinese]].  In general, it is common practice to use standard characters to transcribe Chinese dialects when obvious cognates with words in Standard Mandarin exist.  However, when no obvious cognate could be found for a word, due to factors like irregular sound change or semantic drift in the meanings of characters, or the word originates from a non-Chinese source like a substratum from an earlier displaced language or a later borrowing from another language family, then characters are borrowed and used according to the rebus principle or invented in an ''ad hoc'' manner to transcribe it.  These new characters are generally phonosemantic compounds (e.g., \u4fac, 'person' in Min), although a few are compound ideographs (e.g., \u5b6c, 'bad', in Northeast Mandarin). Except in the case of Written Cantonese, there is no official orthography, and there may be several ways to write a dialectal word, often one that is etymologically correct and one or several that are based on the current pronunciation (e.g., \u89e6\u796d (etymological) vs. \u6233\u9e21 (phonetic), 'eat' (low-register) in Shanghainese).  Speakers of a dialect will generally recognize a dialectal word if it is transcribed according to phonetic considerations, while the etymologically correct form may be more difficult or impossible to recognize.  For example, few Gan speakers would recognize the character meaning 'to lean' in their dialect, because this character (\u9691) has become archaic in Standard Mandarin. The historically \"correct\" transcription is often so obscure that it is uncovered only after considerable scholarly research into philology and historical phonology and may be disputed by other researchers.\n\nAs an exception, [[Written Cantonese]] is in widespread use in [[Hong Kong]], even for certain formal documents, due to the former British [[colony|colonial]] administration's recognition of Cantonese for use for official purposes. In Taiwan, there is also a body of semi-official characters used to represent [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]].  For example, the vernacular character {{Lang|zh|\u34fe}}, pronounced ''cii<sup>11</sup>'' in [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], means \"to kill\".<ref>[http://hakka.dict.edu.tw/hakkadict/result.jsp?page=1&sample=\u982d Hakka Dictionary]</ref> Other varieties of Chinese with a significant number of speakers, like [[Shanghainese]] Wu, [[Gan Chinese]], and [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuanese]], also have their own series of characters, but these are not often seen, except on advertising billboards directed toward locals and are not used in formal settings except to give precise transcriptions of witness statements in legal proceedings.  Written Standard Mandarin is the preference for all mainland regions.\n\n===Japanese===\n\nIn Japanese there are 2,136 ''[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5e38\u7528\u6f22\u5b57}}, lit. \"frequently used Chinese characters\") designated by the [[Japanese Ministry of Education]]; these are taught during primary and secondary school. The list is a recommendation, not a restriction, and many characters missing from it are still in common use.<ref>{{cite web|title=What are the J\u014dy\u014d Kanji?|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/jouyou-kanji.html|website=sci.lang.japan FAQ|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne area where character usage is officially restricted is in names, which may contain only government-approved characters. Since the ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji'' list excludes many characters that have been used in personal and place names for generations, an additional list, referred to as the  ''[[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u4eba\u540d\u7528\u6f22\u5b57}}, lit. \"kanji for use in personal names\"), is published.<ref>{{cite web|title=What are the Jinmeiy\u014d Kanji?|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/jinmeiyou-kanji.html|website=sci.lang.japan FAQ|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref> It currently contains 983 characters.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nToday, a well-educated Japanese person may know upwards of 3,500 characters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The ''[[kanji kentei]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c\u6f22\u5b57\u80fd\u529b\u691c\u5b9a\u8a66\u9a13}}, ''Nihon Kanji N\u014dryoku Kentei Shiken'' or ''Test of Japanese Kanji Aptitude'') tests a speaker's ability to read and write kanji. The highest level of the ''kanji kentei'' tests on approximately 6,000 kanji,<ref>{{cite web|title=Kanji Kentei|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kanji-kentei.html|website=sci.lang.japan FAQ|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Koichi|title=The Ultimate Kanji Test: Kanji Kentei|url=http://www.tofugu.com/2011/04/06/kanji-kentei-test/|website=Tofugu|accessdate=11 November 2015|date=2011-04-06}}</ref> though in practice few people attain (or need to attain) this level.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Modern creation===\nNew characters can in principle be coined at any time, just as new words can be, but they may not be adopted. Significant historically recent coinages date to scientific terms of the 19th century. Specifically, Chinese coined new characters for chemical elements \u2013 see [[chemical elements in East Asian languages]] \u2013 which continue to be used and taught in schools in China and Taiwan. In Japan, in the [[Meiji era]] (specifically, late 19th century), new characters were coined for some (but not all) SI units, such as {{Nihongo2|\u7c81}} ({{Nihongo2|\u7c73}} \"meter\" + {{Nihongo2|\u5343}} \"thousand, kilo-\") for kilometer. These [[kokuji]] (Japanese-coinages) have found use in China as well \u2013 see [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|Chinese characters for SI units]] for details.\n\nWhile new characters can be easily coined by writing on paper, they are difficult to represent on a computer \u2013 they must generally be represented as a picture, rather than as text \u2013 which presents a significant barrier to their use or widespread adoption. Compare this with the use of symbols as names in 20th century musical albums such as ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' (1971) and ''[[Love Symbol Album]]'' (1993); an album cover may potentially contain any graphics, but in writing and other computation these symbols are difficult to use.\n\n==Indexing==\nDozens of indexing schemes have been created for arranging Chinese characters in [[Chinese dictionary|Chinese dictionaries]]. The great majority of these schemes have appeared in only a single dictionary; only one such system has achieved truly widespread use. This is the system of [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] (see for example, the 214 so-called [[Kangxi radical]]s).\n\nChinese character dictionaries often allow users to locate entries in several ways. Many Chinese, Japanese, and Korean dictionaries of Chinese characters list characters in radical order: characters are grouped together by radical, and radicals containing fewer [[stroke (Chinese character)|strokes]] come before radicals containing more strokes ([[radical-and-stroke sorting]]). Under each radical, characters are listed by their total number of strokes. It is often also possible to search for characters by sound, using [[pinyin]] (in Chinese dictionaries), [[bopomofo|zhuyin]] (in Taiwanese dictionaries), [[kana]] (in Japanese dictionaries) or [[hangul]] (in Korean dictionaries). Most dictionaries also allow searches by total number of strokes, and individual dictionaries often allow other search methods as well.\n\nFor instance, to look up the character where the sound is not known, e.g., {{Lang|zh|\u677e}} (pine tree), the user first determines which part of the character is the radical (here {{Lang|zh|\u6728}}), then counts the number of strokes in the radical (four), and turns to the radical index (usually located on the inside front or back cover of the dictionary). Under the number \"4\" for radical stroke count, the user locates {{Lang|zh|\u6728}}, then turns to the page number listed, which is the start of the listing of all the characters containing this radical. This page will have a sub-index giving remainder stroke numbers (for the non-radical portions of characters) and page numbers. The right half of the character also contains four strokes, so the user locates the number 4, and turns to the page number given. From there, the user must scan the entries to locate the character he or she is seeking. Some dictionaries have a sub-index which lists every character containing each radical, and if the user knows the number of strokes in the non-radical portion of the character, he or she can locate the correct page directly.\n\nAnother dictionary system is the [[four corner method]], where characters are classified according to the shape of each of the four corners.\n\nMost modern Chinese dictionaries and Chinese dictionaries sold to English speakers use the traditional radical-based character index in a section at the front, while the main body of the dictionary arranges the main character entries alphabetically according to their [[pinyin]] spelling.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} To find a character with unknown sound using one of these dictionaries, the reader finds the radical and stroke number of the character, as before, and locates the character in the radical index. The character's entry will have the character's pronunciation in pinyin written down; the reader then turns to the main dictionary section and looks up the pinyin spelling alphabetically.\n\n==See also==\n{{sister project|project=wiktionary|text=[[:Wiktionary:Index:Chinese radical|Radical index]] on ''[[Wiktionary]]''}}\n{{sister project|project=wiktionary|text=[[:Wiktionary:Index:Chinese total strokes|Total strokes index]] on ''[[Wiktionary]]''}}\n* [[Adoption of Chinese literary culture]]\n* [[Chinese family of scripts]]\n* [[Character amnesia]]\n* [[Chinese character encoding]]\n* [[Chinese input methods for computers]]\n* [[Chinese numerals|Chinese numerals, or how to write numbers with Chinese characters]]\n* [[Chinese punctuation]]\n* [[Eight Principles of Yong]]\n* [[Stroke order]]\n* [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts]]\n* [[List of languages by writing system#Chinese characters and derivatives|List of languages written in Chinese characters and derivatives of Chinese characters]]\n* [[Romanization of Chinese]]\n* [[Transcription into Chinese characters]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n{{PD-old-text | title = The Chinese recorder and missionary journal, Volume 3 | year = 1871 | author = }}\n{{refbegin|indent=yes|30em}}\n<!-- Please use {Cite book} & {Cite web} templates -->\n* {{cite book | title = A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology | given = William H. | surname = Baxter | author-link = William H.

They remain a key component of the [[Japanese writing system]] where they are known as ''[[kanji]]''. Chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://en.artintern.net/index.php/news/main/html/1/1101|title=History of Chinese Writing Shown in the Museums|publisher=CCTV online|accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref> By virtue of their widespread current use in East Asia, and historic use throughout the [[Adoption of Chinese literary culture|Sinosphere]], Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world by number of users. Chinese characters number in the tens of thousands, though most of them are minor graphic variants encountered only in historical texts. Unlike an alphabet, a character-based writing system associates each logogram with an entire sound and thus may be compared in some aspects to a syllabary.\n\n[[Functional literacy]] in [[written Chinese]] requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=73}} In Japan, 2,136 are taught through secondary school (the ''[[J\u014dy\u014d kanji]]''); hundreds more are in everyday use. Due to [[Shinjitai|post-WWII simplifications of characters in Japan]] as well as [[Simplified Chinese characters|in China]], the Chinese characters used in Japan today are distinct from those used in China in several respects. There are various national standard lists of characters, forms, and pronunciations. [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified forms of certain characters]] are used in mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia; the corresponding [[traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]] are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and to a limited extent in South Korea. In Japan, common characters are written in [[shinjitai|post-WWII Japan-specific simplified forms]], while uncommon characters are written in [[ky\u016bjitai|Japanese traditional forms]], which are virtually identical to Chinese traditional forms.\n\nIn modern Chinese, the majority of Chinese words today consist of two or more characters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Clare Patricia|title=Contemporary perspectives on reading and spelling| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z6d5AgAAQBAJ | year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-49716-9|page=203|author2=Connelly, Vincent|quote=Often, the Chinese character can function as an independent unit in sentences, but sometimes it must be paired with another character or more to form a word. [...] Most words consist of two or more characters, and more than 80 per cent make use of lexical compounding of morphemes (Packard, 2000).}}</ref> A character almost always corresponds to a single syllable that is also a [[morpheme]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/east_asian_languages.html |title=East Asian Languages at |publisher=Pinyin.info |date= |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> However, there are a few exceptions to this general correspondence, including bisyllabic morphemes (written with two characters), bimorphemic syllables (written with two characters) and cases where a single character represents a polysyllabic word or phrase.<ref name=\"vmair\" />\n\nModern Chinese has many [[homophone]]s; thus the same spoken syllable may be represented by many characters, depending on meaning. A single character may also have a range of meanings, or sometimes quite distinct meanings; occasionally these correspond to different pronunciations. [[Cognate]]s in the several [[varieties of Chinese]] are generally written with the same character. In other languages, most significantly today in Japanese and sometimes in Korean, characters are used to represent Chinese loanwords, to represent native words independently of the Chinese pronunciation (e.g., [[kunyomi]] in Japanese), and as purely phonetic elements based on their pronunciation in the historical variety of Chinese from which they were acquired. These foreign adaptations of Chinese pronunciation are known as [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]] and have been useful in the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstruction]] of [[Middle Chinese]].\n\n==Function==\nWhen the script was first used in the late 2nd millennium&nbsp;BC, words of [[Old Chinese]] were generally monosyllabic, and each character denoted a single word.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=58}} Increasing numbers of polysyllabic words have entered the language from the [[Western Zhou]] period to the present day. It is estimated that about 25\u201330% of the vocabulary of classic texts from the [[Warring States period]] was polysyllabic, though these words were used far less commonly than monosyllables, which accounted for 80\u201390% of occurrences in these texts.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=22}}\nThe process has accelerated over the centuries as phonetic change has increased the number of homophones.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=112}}\nIt has been estimated that over two thirds of the 3,000 most common words in modern [[Standard Chinese]] are polysyllables, the vast majority of those being disyllables.{{sfn|Yip|2000|p=18}}\n\nThe most common process has been to form [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] of existing words, written with the characters of the constituent words. Words have also been created by adding [[affixes]], [[reduplication]] and [[loanword|borrowing]] from other languages.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=155\u2013156}}\nPolysyllabic words are generally written with one character per syllable.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=74}}{{efn|Abbreviations are occasionally used \u2013 see {{section link||Polysyllabic characters}}.}}\nIn most cases the character denotes a [[morpheme]] descended from an Old Chinese word.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=74\u201375}}\n\nMany characters have multiple readings, with instances denoting different morphemes, sometimes with different pronunciations. In modern Standard Chinese, one fifth of the 2,400 most common characters have multiple pronunciations.\nFor the 500 most common characters, the proportion rises to 30%.<ref>{{cite web | title = Chinese characters with multiple pronunciations | given = Mark | surname = Swofford | website = pinyin.info | year = 2010 | url = http://pinyin.info/chinese_characters/ | access-date = 4 July 2016 }}</ref>\nOften these readings are similar in sound and related in meaning. In the Old Chinese period, [[affix]]es could be added to a word to form a new word, which was often written with the same character. In many cases the pronunciations diverged due to subsequent [[sound change]]. For example, many additional readings have the [[Middle Chinese]] departing tone, the major source of the 4th tone in modern Standard Chinese. Scholars now believe that this tone is the reflex of an Old Chinese *-s suffix, with a range of semantic functions.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=315\u2013317}}\nFor example,\n* {{zh|s=\u4f20|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=\u50b3|labels=no}} has readings OC *drjon > MC ''drjwen'' > Mod. ''chu\u00e1n'' 'to transmit' and *drjons > ''drjwenH'' > ''zhu\u00e0n'' 'a record'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=315}} (Middle Chinese forms are given in [[Baxter's transcription for Middle Chinese|Baxter's transcription]], in which ''H'' denotes the departing tone.)\n* {{zh|c=\u78e8|labels=no}} has readings *maj > ''ma'' > ''m\u00f3'' 'to grind' and *majs > ''maH'' > ''m\u00f2'' 'grindstone'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=315}}\n* {{zh|c=\u5bbf|labels=no}} has readings *sjuk > ''sjuwk'' > ''s\u00f9'' 'to stay overnight' and *sjuks > ''sjuwH'' > ''xi\u00f9'' 'celestial \"mansion\"'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=316}}\n* {{zh|s=\u8bf4|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=\u8aac|labels=no}} has readings *hljot > ''sywet'' > ''shu\u014d'' 'speak' and *hljots > ''sywejH'' > ''shu\u00ec'' 'exhort'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=197, 305}}\nAnother common alternation is between voiced and voiceless initials (though the voicing distinction has disappeared on most modern varieties).\nThis is believed to reflect an ancient prefix, but scholars disagree on whether the voiced or voiceless form is the original root.\nFor example,\n* {{zh|s=\u89c1|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=\u898b|labels=no}} has readings *kens > ''kenH'' > ''ji\u00e0n'' 'to see' and *gens > ''henH'' > ''xi\u00e0n'' 'to appear'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=218}}\n* {{zh|s=\u8d25|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=\u6557|labels=no}} has readings *prats > ''p\u00e6jH'' > ''b\u00e0i'' 'to defeat' and *brats > ''b\u00e6jH'' > ''b\u00e0i'' 'to be defeated'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=218}} (In this case the pronunciations have converged in Standard Chinese, but not in some other varieties.)\n* {{zh|c=\u6298|labels=no}} has readings *tjat > ''tsyet'' > ''zh\u00e9'' 'to bend' and *djat > ''dzyet'' > ''sh\u00e9'' 'to break by bending'.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=219}}\n\n==Principles of formation==\n[[File:chineseprimer3.png|right|upright=0.7|thumb|Excerpt from a 1436 primer on Chinese characters]]\n{{Main|Chinese character classification}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 300\n | footer = Evolution of pictograms\n  | image1 = Evo-r\u00ec.svg\n | caption1 = Sun\n | image2 = Evo-sh\u0101n.svg\n |caption2 = Mountain\n | image3 = Evo-elephant.png\n | caption3 = Elephant\n}}\nChinese characters represent words of the language using several strategies. A few characters, including some of the most commonly used, were originally [[pictogram]]s, which depicted the objects denoted, or [[ideogram]]s, in which meaning was expressed [[iconicity|iconically]]. The vast majority were written using the [[rebus principle]], in which a character for a similarly sounding word was either simply borrowed or (more commonly) extended with a disambiguating semantic marker to form a phono-semantic compound character.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=58\u201361}}\n\nThe traditional six-fold classification (''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|li\u00f9sh\u016b}}'' {{lang|zh-Hans|\u516d\u4e66}} / {{lang|zh-Hant|\u516d\u66f8}} \"six writings\") was first described by the scholar [[Xu Shen]] in the postface of his dictionary ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' in 100&nbsp;AD.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=67\u201369}}\nWhile this analysis is sometimes problematic and arguably fails to reflect the complete nature of the Chinese writing system, it has been perpetuated by its long history and pervasive use.\n\n===Pictograms===\n* {{lang|zh|\u8c61\u5f62\u5b57}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|xi\u00e0ngx\u00edngz\u00ec}}''\n[[Pictogram]]s are highly stylized and simplified pictures of material objects.  Examples of pictograms include {{lang|zh|\u65e5}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|r\u00ec}}'' for \"sun\", {{lang|zh|\u6708}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|yu\u00e8}}'' for \"moon\", and {{lang|zh|\u6728}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|m\u00f9}}'' for \"tree\" or \"wood\". Xu Shen placed approximately 4% of characters in this category. \nThough few in number and expressing literal objects, pictograms and ideograms are nonetheless the basis on which all the more complex characters such as associative idea characters  (\u4f1a\u610f\u5b57) and pictophonetic characters (\u5f62\u58f0\u5b57) are formed.\n\nPictograms are primary characters in the sense that they, along with ideograms (indicative characters i.e. symbols), are the building blocks of compound characters (\u610f\u610f\u5b57) and picto-phonetic characters (\u5f62\u58f0\u5b57). \n\nOver time pictograms were increasingly standardized, simplified, and stylized to make them easier to write. Furthermore, the same kangxi radical character element can be used to depict different objects. \nThus, the image depicted by most pictograms is not often immediately evident. For example \u53e3 may indicate the mouth, a window as in \u9ad8 which depicts a tall building as a symbol of the idea of \"tall\" or the lip of a vessel as in \u5bcc a wine jar under a roof as symbol of wealth.  That is, pictograms extended from literal objects to take on symbolic or metaphoric meanings; sometimes even displacing the use of the character as a literal term, or creating ambiguity, which was resolved though character determinants, more commonly but less accurately known as \"radicals\" i.e. concept keys in the phono-semantic characters.\n\n===Simple ideograms===\n* {{lang|zh|\u6307\u4e8b\u5b57}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|zh\u01d0sh\u00ecz\u00ec}}''\n\nAlso called ''simple indicatives,'' this small category contains characters that are direct [[iconicity|iconic]] illustrations. Examples include {{lang|zh|\u4e0a}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|sh\u00e0ng}}'' \"up\" and {{lang|zh|\u4e0b}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|xi\u00e0}}'' \"down\", originally a dot above and below a line. Indicative characters are symbols for abstract concepts which could not be depicted literally but nonetheless can be expressed as a visual symbol e.g. concave \u51f8 \uff0c convex \u51f9, flat-and-level \u5e73\n\n===Associative idea characters (compound conceptual characters)===\n* {{lang|zh-Hans|\u4f1a\u610f\u5b57}} / {{lang|zh-Hant|\u6703\u610f\u5b57}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|hu\u00ecy\u00ecz\u00ec}}''\nAlso translated as logical aggregates or associative compounds, these characters have been interpreted as combining two or more pictographic or ideographic characters to suggest a third meaning.  The canonical example is {{lang|zh|\u660e}} bright. \u660e is the association of the two brightest objects in the sky the sun \u65e5 and moon \u6708, brought together to express the idea of \"bright\". It is canonical because the term \u660e\u767d in Chinese (lit. \"bright white\") means \"to understand, understand\". Other commonly cited examples include {{lang|zh|\u4f11}} \"rest\" (composed of the pictograms {{lang|zh|\u4eba}} \"person\" and {{lang|zh|\u6728}} \"tree\") and {{lang|zh|\u597d}} \"good\" (composed of {{lang|zh|\u5973}} \"woman\" and {{lang|zh|\u5b50}} \"child\").\n\nXu Shen placed approximately 13% of characters in this category, but many of his examples are now believed to be phono-semantic compounds whose origin has been obscured by subsequent changes in their form.{{sfn|Sampson|Chen|2013|p=261}} [[Peter Boodberg]] and William Boltz go so far as to deny that any of the compound characters devised in ancient times were of this type, maintaining that now-lost \"secondary readings\" are responsible for the apparent absence of phonetic indicators,{{sfn|Boltz|1994|pp=104\u2013110}} but their arguments have been rejected by other scholars.{{sfn|Sampson|Chen|2013|pp=265\u2013268}}\n\nIn contrast, associative compound characters are common among [[kokuji|characters coined in Japan]]. Also, a few characters coined in China in modern times, such as {{lang|zh-Hant|\u9251}} platinum, \"white metal\" (see [[chemical elements in East Asian languages]]) belong to this category.\n\n===Rebus===\n* {{lang|zh|\u5047\u501f\u5b57}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|ji\u01ceji\u00e8z\u00ec}}''\n\nAlso called ''borrowings'' or ''phonetic loan characters,'' the [[rebus]] category covers cases where an existing character is used to represent an unrelated word with similar or identical pronunciation; sometimes the old meaning is then lost completely, as with characters such as {{lang|zh|\u81ea}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|z\u00ec}}'', which has lost its original meaning of \"nose\" completely and exclusively means \"oneself\", or {{lang|zh-Hant|\u842c}}<!--NOT \u4e07, no adding this character, which has not relevant origins--> ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|w\u00e0n}}'', which originally meant \"scorpion\" but is now used only in the sense of \"ten thousand\".\n\nRebus was pivotal in the history of writing in China insofar as it represented the stage at which logographic writing could become purely phonetic (phonographic). Chinese characters used purely for their sound values are attested in the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States]] period manuscripts, in which ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|zhi}}'' {{lang|zh|\u6c0f}} was used to write ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|shi}}'' {{lang|zh|\u662f}} and vice versa, just lines apart; the same happened with ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|shao}}'' \u52fa for ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|Zhao}}'' {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8d99}}, with the characters in question being homophonous or nearly homophonous at the time.{{sfn|Boltz|1994|p=169}}\n\n====Phonetical usage for foreign words====\nChinese characters are used rebus-like and exclusively for their phonetic value when transcribing words of foreign origin, such as ancient Buddhist terms or modern foreign names. For example, the word for the country \"[[Romania]]\" is \u7f57\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a (Lu\u00f3 M\u01ce N\u00ed Y\u00e0), in which the Chinese characters are only used for their sounds and do not provide any meaning.<ref name=\"AEG\">{{cite book |last1=Gnanadesikan |first1=Amalia E. |title=The Writing Revolution: Cuneiform to the Internet |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9781444359855 |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nlEPhP900-UC&pg=PT61 |language=en}}</ref> This usage is similar to that of the Japanese [[Katakana]], although the Katakanas use a special set of simplified forms of Chinese characters, in order to advertize their value as purely phonetic symbols.

These characters are composed of at least two parts. A semantic component, often a character key as a clue to the topic to which the character refers, often in an abbreviated form, The [[semantics|semantic]] component suggests the general meaning of the compound character. The  [[phonetics|phonetic]] component suggests the pronunciation of the compound character. In most cases the semantic indicator is also the \u90e8\u9996 [[radical (Chinese characters)|radical]] under which the character is listed in dictionaries. Because Chinese is replete in homophones phonetic elements may also carry semantic content. In some rare examples phono-semantic characters may also convey pictorial content. Each Chinese character is an attempt to combine sound, image, and idea in a mutually reinforcing fashion.\n\nExamples of phono-semantic characters include {{lang|zh|\u6cb3}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|h\u00e9}}'' \"river\", {{lang|zh|\u6e56}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|h\u00fa}}'' \"lake\", {{lang|zh|\u6d41}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|li\u00fa}}'' \"stream\", {{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c96}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|ch\u014dng}}'' \"surge\", {{lang|zh|\u6ed1}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|hu\u00e1}}'' \"slippery\". All these characters have on the left a radical of three short strokes (\u6c35), which is a reduced form of the character \u6c34 ''shu\u01d0'' meaning \"water\", indicating that the character has a semantic connection with water. The right-hand side in each case is a phonetic indicator. For example, in the case of {{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c96}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|ch\u014dng}}'' (Old Chinese {{IPA|*\u0261-lju\u014b}}{{sfn|Baxter|1992|p=750}}) \"surge\", the phonetic indicator is {{lang|zh|\u4e2d}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|zh\u014dng}}'' (Old Chinese {{IPA|*k-lju\u014b}}{{sfn|Baxter|1992|p=810}}), which by itself means \"middle\". In this case it can be seen that the pronunciation of the character is slightly different from that of its phonetic indicator; the effect of historical sound change means that the composition of such characters can sometimes seem arbitrary today.\n\nIn general, phonetic components do not determine the exact pronunciation of a character, but only give a clue to a its pronunciation. While some characters take the exact pronunciation of their phonetic component, others take only the initial or final sounds.{{sfn|Williams}} In fact, some characters' pronunciations may not correspond to the pronunciations of their phonetic parts at all, which is sometimes the case with characters after having undergone simplification. The 8 characters in the following table all take \u4e5f for their phonetic part, however, as it is readily apparent, none of them take the pronunciation of \u4e5f, which is y\u011b (Old Chinese *laj\u0294).  As the table below shows, the sound changes that have taken place since the Shang/Zhou period when most of these characters were created can be dramatic, to the point of not providing any useful hint of the modern pronunciation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"font-variant:small-caps\" | 8 phono-semantic compounds with phonetic part \u4e5f (y\u011b)<ref>{{cite web|title=\u4e5f|url=http://zhongwen.com/d/164/x93.htm|website=\u4e2d\u6587.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref> \n!

Many [[Periodic table in East Asian languages|Chinese names of elements in the periodic table]] and many other [[Organic nomenclature in Chinese|chemistry-related characters]] were formed this way. In fact, it is possible to tell from a Chinese periodic table at a glance which elements are metal ({{Lang|zh|\u91d1}}), solid nonmetal ({{Lang|zh|\u77f3}}, \"stone\"), liquid ({{Lang|zh|\u6c35}}), or gas ({{Lang|zh|\u6c14}}).\n\nOccasionally a bisyllabic word is written with two characters that contain the same radical, as in {{lang|zh|\u8774\u8776}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|h\u00fadi\u00e9}}'' \"butterfly\", where both characters have the insect radical {{lang|zh|\u866b}}. A notable example is [[pipa]] (a Chinese lute, also a fruit, the [[loquat]], of similar shape) \u2013 originally written as {{lang|zh|\u6279\u628a}} with the hand radical (\u624c), referring to the down and up strokes when playing this instrument, which was then changed to {{lang|zh|\u6787\u6777}} (tree radical {{lang|zh|\u6728}}), which is still used for the fruit, while the character was changed to {{lang|zh|\u7435\u7436}} when referring to the instrument (radical {{Lang|zh|\u73a8}}) .<ref>[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]</ref> In other cases a compound word may coincidentally share a radical without this being meaningful.\n\n===Transformed cognates===\n* {{lang|zh-Hans|\u8f6c\u6ce8\u5b57}} / {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8f49\u6ce8\u5b57}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|zhu\u01cenzh\u00f9z\u00ec}}''\n\nThe smallest category of characters is also the least understood.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=69}} In the postface to the ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|Shuowen Jiezi}}'', Xu Shen gave as an example the characters {{lang|zh|\u8003}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|k\u01ceo}}'' \"to verify\" and {{lang|zh|\u8001}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|l\u01ceo}}'' \"old\", which had similar Old Chinese pronunciations (*khu\u0294 and *C-ru\u0294 respectively{{sfn|Baxter|1992|pp=771, 772}}) and may once have been the same word, meaning \"elderly person\", but became [[Lexicalization|lexicalized]] into two separate words.

As early as the Shang dynasty, oracle-bone script coexisted as a simplified form alongside the normal script of [[bamboo]] books (preserved in typical [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronze inscriptions]]), as well as the extra-elaborate pictorial forms (often clan emblems) found on many bronzes.[[File:Western Zhou Ritual Containers3.jpg|thumb|left|Left: Bronze f\u0101ngz\u016bn ({{linktext|\u65b9|\u6a3d|lang=zh}}) ritual wine container dated about 1000&nbsp;BC.

The inscription comments on state rituals that accompanied court ceremony, recorded by an official scribe.]] Based on studies of these bronze inscriptions, it is clear that, from the Shang dynasty writing to that of the [[Western Zhou]] and early [[Eastern Zhou]], the mainstream script evolved in a slow, unbroken fashion, until assuming the form that is now known as [[seal script]] in the late Eastern Zhou in the state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]], without any clear line of division.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=59\u2013150}}<ref>Ch\u00e9n Zh\u0101or\u00f3ng 2003.</ref> Meanwhile, other scripts had evolved, especially in the eastern and southern areas during the late [[Zhou dynasty]], including regional forms, such as the ''g\u01d4w\u00e9n'' (\"ancient forms\") of the eastern [[Warring States]] preserved as variant forms in the [[Han dynasty]] character dictionary ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', as well as decorative forms such as [[Bird-worm seal script|bird and insect scripts]].\n\n===Unification: seal script, vulgar writing and proto-clerical===\n{{Calligraphy}}\n[[Seal script]], which had evolved slowly in the state of Qin during the Eastern [[Zhou dynasty]], became standardized and adopted as the formal script for all of China in the [[Qin dynasty]] (leading to a popular misconception that it was invented at that time), and was still widely used for decorative engraving and [[seal (device)|seals]] (name chops, or signets) in the [[Han dynasty]] period. However, despite the Qin script standardization, more than one script remained in use at the time. For example, a little-known, rectilinear and roughly executed kind of common (vulgar) writing had for centuries coexisted with the more formal seal script in the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]], and the popularity of this vulgar writing grew as the use of writing itself became more widespread.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=104}} By the [[Warring States period]], an immature form of [[clerical script]] called \"early clerical\" or \"proto-clerical\" had already developed in the state of Qin{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=59, 104\u2013107}} based upon this vulgar writing, and with influence from seal script as well.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=119}} The coexistence of the three scripts \u2013 small seal, vulgar and proto-clerical, with the latter evolving gradually in the Qin to early Han dynasties into [[clerical script]] \u2013 runs counter to the traditional belief that the Qin dynasty had one script only, and that clerical script was suddenly invented in the early Han dynasty from the [[small seal script]].\n\n===Han dynasty===\n\n====Proto-clerical evolving to clerical====\nProto-clerical script, which had emerged by the time of the Warring States period from vulgar Qin writing, matured gradually, and by the early Western Han period, it was little different from that of the Qin.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=123}} Recently discovered bamboo slips show the script becoming mature clerical script by the middle-to-late reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu of the Western Han]],{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=119, 123\u2013124}} who ruled from 141 to 87&nbsp;BC.\n\n====Clerical and clerical cursive====\nContrary to the popular belief of there being only one script per period, there were in fact multiple scripts in use during the Han period.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=130}} Although mature [[clerical script]], also called {{Lang|zh|\u516b\u5206}} (b\u0101f\u0113n){{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=121}} script, was dominant at that time, an early type of [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]] was also in use by the Han by at least as early as 24&nbsp;BC (during the very late Western Han period),{{efn|{{harvnb|Qiu|2000|pp=132\u2013133}} provides archaeological evidence for this dating, in contrast to unsubstantiated claims dating the beginning of cursive anywhere from the Qin to the Eastern Han.}} incorporating cursive forms popular at the time, well as many elements from the vulgar writing of the [[Qin (state)|Warring State of Qin]].{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=131, 133}} By around the time of the Eastern [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], this Han cursive became known as {{Lang|zh|\u7ae0\u8349}} ''zh\u0101ngc\u01ceo'' (also known as {{zh|s=\u96b6\u8349|labels=no}} / {{zh|t=\u96b8\u8349|labels=no}} ''l\u00ecc\u01ceo'' today), or in English sometimes clerical cursive, ancient cursive, or draft cursive. Some believe that the name, based on {{Lang|zh|\u7ae0}} ''zh\u0101ng'' meaning \"orderly\", arose because the script was a more orderly form{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=138}} of cursive than [[Cursive script (East Asia)|the modern form]], which emerged during the Eastern [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] and is still in use today, called {{Lang|zh|\u4eca\u8349}} ''j\u012bnc\u01ceo'' or \"modern cursive\".{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=131}}\n\n====Neo-clerical====\nAround the mid-[[Eastern Han]] period,{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=138}} a simplified and easier-to-write form of clerical script appeared, which Qiu terms \"neo-clerical\" ({{Lang|zh|\u65b0\u96b6\u4f53}} / {{Lang|zh|\u65b0\u96b8\u9ad4}}, ''x\u012bnl\u00ect\u01d0'').{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=113, 139}} By the late Eastern Han, this had become the dominant daily script,{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=138}} although the formal, mature ''b\u0101f\u0113n'' ({{Lang|zh|\u516b\u5206}}) clerical script remained in use for formal works such as engraved [[stelae]].{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=138}} Qiu describes this neo-clerical script as a transition between clerical and regular script,{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=138}} and it remained in use through the [[Cao Wei]] and [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasties]].{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=139}}\n\n====Semi-cursive====\nBy the late Eastern Han period, an early form of [[semi-cursive script]] appeared,{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=113, 139}} developing out of a cursively written form of neo-clerical script{{efn|{{harvnb|Qiu|2000|pp=140\u2013141}} mentions examples of neo-clerical with \"strong overtones of cursive script\" from the late Eastern Han.}} and simple cursive.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=142}} This semi-cursive script was traditionally attributed to Liu Desheng c. 147\u2013188&nbsp;AD,{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=139}}{{efn|Liu is said to have taught [[Zhong Yao]] and [[Wang Xizhi]].}} although such attributions refer to early masters of a script rather than to their actual inventors, since the scripts generally evolved into being over time.

Zhong Yao has been called the \"father of regular script\". However, some scholars<ref>[http://www.guoyiguan.com/cgi-bin/topic.cgi?forum=8&topic=1 Transcript of lecture {{Lang|zh|\u300a\u6977\u6cd5\u7121\u6b3a\u300b}} by {{Lang|zh|\u7530\u82f1\u7ae0}}{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711134656/http://www.guoyiguan.com/cgi-bin/topic.cgi?forum=8&topic=1 |date=2011-07-11 }}. Retrieved 2010-05-22.</ref> postulate that one person alone could not have developed a new script which was universally adopted, but could only have been a contributor to its gradual formation. The earliest surviving pieces written in regular script are copies of Zhong Yao's works, including at least one copied by [[Wang Xizhi]]. This new script, which is the dominant modern Chinese script, developed out of a neatly written form of early semi-cursive, with addition of the pause ({{zh|s=\u987f|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=\u9813|labels=no}} ''d\u00f9n'') technique to end horizontal strokes, plus heavy tails on strokes which are written to the downward-right diagonal.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=143}} Thus, early regular script emerged from a neat, formal form of semi-cursive,  which had itself emerged from neo-clerical (a simplified, convenient form of clerical script). It then matured further in the Eastern [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] in the hands of the \"Sage of Calligraphy\", [[Wang Xizhi]], and his son [[Wang Xianzhi (calligrapher)|Wang Xianzhi]]. It was not, however, in widespread use at that time, and most writers continued using neo-clerical, or a somewhat semi-cursive form of it, for daily writing,{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=143}} while the conservative bafen clerical script remained in use on some stelae, alongside some semi-cursive, but primarily neo-clerical.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=144}}\n\n====Modern cursive====\nMeanwhile, modern cursive script slowly emerged from the clerical cursive (''zh\u0101ngc\u01ceo'') script during the Cao Wei to Jin period, under the influence of both semi-cursive and the newly emerged regular script.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=148}} Cursive was formalized in the hands of a few master calligraphers, the most famous and influential of whom was [[Wang Xizhi]].{{efn|W\u00e1ng X\u012bzh\u012b is so credited in essays by other calligraphers in the 6th to early 7th centuries, and most of his extant pieces are in modern cursive script.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=148}}}}\n\n===Dominance and maturation of regular script===\nIt was not until the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] that regular script rose to dominant status.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=145}} During that period, regular script continued evolving stylistically, reaching full maturity in the early [[Tang dynasty]]. Some call the writing of the early Tang calligrapher [[Ouyang Xun]] (557\u2013641) the first mature regular script. After this point, although developments in the art of calligraphy and in character simplification still lay ahead, there were no more major stages of evolution for the mainstream script.\n\n===Modern history===\nAlthough most of the simplified Chinese characters in use today are the result of the works moderated by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] in the 1950s and 60s, character simplification predates the republic's formation in 1949.\nOne of the earliest proponents of character simplification was [[Lufei Kui]], who proposed in 1909 that simplified characters should be used in education. In the years following the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919, many anti-imperialist Chinese intellectuals sought ways to modernise China. In the 1930s and 1940s, discussions on character simplification took place within the [[Kuomintang]] government, and many Chinese intellectuals and writers have long maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in China. In many world languages, literacy has been promoted as a justification for [[spelling reform]]s. The People's Republic of China issued its first round of official character simplifications in two documents, the first in 1956 and the second in 1964. In the 1950s and 1960s, while confusion about simplified characters was still rampant, transitional characters that mixed simplified parts with yet-to-be simplified parts of characters together appeared briefly, then disappeared.\n\n\"[[Han unification]]\" was an effort by the authors of Unicode and the Universal Character Set to map multiple character sets of the so-called CJK languages (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) into a single set of unified characters and was completed for the purposes of [[Unicode]] in 1991 (Unicode&nbsp;1.0).\n\nApart from Chinese ones, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese normative medium of record-keeping, written historical narratives and official communication are in adaptations and variations of Chinese script.<ref>\"...East Asia had been among the \ufb01rst regions of the world to produce written records of the past. Well into modern times Chinese script, the common script across East Asia, served\u2014with local adaptations and variations\u2014as the normative medium of record-keeping and written historical narrative, as well as of\ufb01cial communication. This was true, not only in China itself, but in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.\" The Oxford History of Historical Writing. Volume 3.

[[Inariyama Sword]]}}\n\nChinese characters were first used in Vietnam during the [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|millennium of Chinese rule]] starting in 111&nbsp;BC. They were used to write Classical Chinese and adapted around the 13th century to create the [[Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m|N\u00f4m]] script to write Vietnamese.\n\nCurrently, the only non-Chinese language outside of China that regularly uses the Chinese script is Japanese. Vietnam abandoned their use in the early 20th&nbsp;century in favour of a Latin-based script, and Korea in the late 20th century in favour of its homegrown [[hangul]] script, although as Korea switched much more recently, many Koreans still learn them to read texts written before then, or in some cases to disambiguate homophones.{{Citation Needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Japanese===\n{{Main|Kanji}}\nChinese characters adapted to write [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words are known as [[kanji]]. Chinese words borrowed into Japanese could be written with Chinese characters, while native Japanese words could also be written using the character(s) for a Chinese word of similar meaning. Most kanji have both the native (and often multi-syllabic) Japanese pronunciation, known as kun'yomi, and the (mono-syllabic) Chinese-based pronunciation, known as on'yomi. For example, the native Japanese word ''katana'' is written as {{Nihongo2|\u5200}} in kanji, which uses the native pronunciation since the word is native to Japanese, while the Chinese loanword ''nihont\u014d'' (meaning \"Japanese sword\") is written as {{Nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c\u5200}}, which uses the Chinese-based pronunciation. While nowadays loanwords from non-Sinosphere languages are usually just written in [[katakana]], one of the two syllabary systems of Japanese, loanwords that were borrowed into Japanese before the Meiji Period were typically written with Chinese characters whose on'yomi had the same pronunciation as the loanword itself, words like ''Amerika'' (kanji: {{Nihongo2|\u4e9c\u7c73\u5229\u52a0}}, katakana: {{Nihongo2|\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab}}, meaning: America), ''karuta'' (kanji: {{Nihongo2|\u6b4c\u7559\u591a}}, {{Nihongo2|\u52a0\u7559\u591a}}, katakana: {{Nihongo2|\u30ab\u30eb\u30bf}}, meaning: card, letter), and ''tempura'' (kanji: {{Nihongo2|\u5929\u5a66\u7f85}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5929\u9ea9\u7f85}}, katakana: {{Nihongo2|\u30c6\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9}}, meaning: tempura), although the meanings of the characters used often had no relation to the words themselves. Kanji that are used to only represent the sounds of a word are called [[ateji]]. While foreign loanwords in Japanese words are usually written only in kana, there are some words that normally use ateji to this day, like ''kurabu'' (ateji: {{Nihongo2|\u4ff1\u697d\u90e8}}, katakana: {{Nihongo2|\u30af\u30e9\u30d6}}, meaning: club) and ''sushi'' (ateji: {{Nihongo2|\u5bff\u53f8}}, katakana: {{Nihongo2|\u30b9\u30b7}}).\nBecause there have been multiple layers of borrowing into Japanese, a single character may have several readings in Japanese.{{sfn|Coulmas|1991|pp=122\u2013129}}\n\nWritten Japanese also includes a pair of [[syllabary|syllabaries]] known as [[kana]], derived by simplifying Chinese characters selected to represent syllables of Japanese.\nThe syllabaries differ because they sometimes selected different characters for a syllable, and because they used different strategies to reduce these characters for easy writing: the angular [[katakana]] were obtained by selecting a part of each character, while [[hiragana]] were derived from the cursive forms of whole characters.{{sfn|Coulmas|1991|pp=129\u2013132}}\nModern Japanese writing uses a composite system, using kanji for [[word stem]]s, hiragana for inflexional endings and grammatical words, and katakana to transcribe non-Chinese loanwords as well as serve as a method to emphasize native words (similar to how italics are used in Romance languages).{{sfn|Coulmas|1991|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\n===Korean===\n{{Main|Hanja}}\n\nIn times past, until the 15th century, in Korea, Literary Chinese was the dominant form of written communication prior to the creation of [[hangul]], the Korean alphabet. Much of the vocabulary, especially in the realms of science and sociology, comes directly from Chinese, comparable to Latin or Greek root words in European languages. However, due to the lack of tones in Modern Standard Korean,{{sfn|Ito & Kenstowicz|2017}}  as the words were imported from Chinese, many dissimilar characters and syllables took on identical pronunciations, and subsequently identical spelling in hangul.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  Chinese characters are sometimes used to this day for either clarification in a practical manner, or to give a distinguished appearance, as knowledge of Chinese characters is considered by many Koreans a high class attribute and an indispensable part of a classical education.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It is also observed that the preference for Chinese characters is treated as being conservative and Confucian.\n\nIn South Korea, ''[[hanja]]'' have become a politically contentious issue, with some urging a [[Linguistic purism in Korean|\"purification\" of the national language]] and culture by  abandoning their use. Efforts to re-extend Hanja education to elementary schools in the 2015 were met with generally negative reaction from the public and from teachers' organizations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yoon |first1=Min-sik |title=\u2018Hanja\u2019 education in elementary schools stirs dispute |url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150921001084 |accessdate=26 March 2020 |work=The Korea Herald |date=21 September 2015 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn South Korea, educational policy on characters has swung back and forth, often swayed by education ministers' personal opinions. At present, middle and high school students (grades 7 to 12) are taught 1,800 characters,{{sfnp|Hannas|1997|pp=68\u201372}} albeit with the principal focus on recognition, with the aim of achieving newspaper literacy.\n\nThere is a clear trend toward the exclusive use of hangul in day-to-day South Korean society. Hanja are still used to some extent, particularly in newspapers, weddings, place names and [[calligraphy]] (although it is nowhere near the extent of kanji use in day-to-day Japanese society). Hanja is also extensively used in situations where ambiguity must be avoided,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} such as academic papers, high-level corporate reports, government documents, and newspapers; this is due to the large number of [[homonyms]] that have resulted from [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|extensive borrowing]] of Chinese words.\n\nThe issue of ambiguity is the main hurdle in any effort to \"cleanse\" the Korean language of Chinese characters.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Characters convey meaning visually, while alphabets convey guidance to pronunciation, which in turn hints at meaning. As an example, in Korean dictionaries, the phonetic entry for {{Lang|ko|\uae30\uc0ac}} ''gisa'' yields more than 30 different entries. In the past, this ambiguity had been efficiently resolved by parenthetically displaying the associated hanja. While hanja is sometimes used for Sino-Korean vocabulary, native Korean words are rarely, if ever, written in hanja.\n\nWhen learning how to write hanja, students are taught to memorize the native Korean pronunciation for the hanja's meaning and the Sino-Korean pronunciations (the pronunciation based on the Chinese pronunciation of the characters) for each hanja respectively so that students know what the syllable and meaning is for a particular hanja. For example, the name for the hanja {{Lang|ko|\u6c34}} is {{Lang|ko|\ubb3c}} {{Lang|ko|\uc218}} (mul-su) in which {{Lang|ko|\ubb3c}} (mul) is the native Korean pronunciation for \"water\", while {{Lang|ko|\uc218}} (su) is the Sino-Korean pronunciation of the character. The naming of hanja is similar to if \"water\" were named \"water-aqua\", \"horse-equus\", or \"gold-aurum\" based on a hybridization of both the English and the Latin names. Other examples include {{Lang|ko|\uc0ac\ub78c}} {{Lang|ko|\uc778}} (saram-in) for {{Lang|ko|\u4eba}} \"person/people\", {{Lang|ko|\ud070}} {{Lang|ko|\ub300}} (keun-dae) for {{Lang|ko|\u5927}} \"big/large//great\", {{Lang|ko|\uc791\uc744}} {{Lang|ko|\uc18c}} (jakeul-so) for {{Lang|ko|\u5c0f}} \"small/little\", {{Lang|ko|\uc544\ub798}} {{Lang|ko|\ud558}} (arae-ha) for {{Lang|ko|\u4e0b}} \"underneath/below/low\", {{Lang|ko|\uc544\ube44}} {{Lang|ko|\ubd80}} (abi-bu) for {{Lang|ko|\u7236}} \"father\", and {{Lang|ko|\ub098\ub77c\uc774\ub984}} {{Lang|ko|\ud55c}} (naraireum-han) for {{Lang|ko|\u97d3}} \"Han/Korea\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howtostudykorean.com/hanja-unit-1-lessons-1-20/hanja-lesson-1/|title=Hanja Lesson 1: \u5927, \u5c0f, \u4e2d, \u5c71, \u9580 {{!}} How to study Korean|website=www.howtostudykorean.com|access-date=2016-03-09}}</ref>\n\nIn North Korea, the [[hanja]] system was once completely banned since June 1949 due to fears of collapsed containment of the country; during the 1950s, [[Kim Il Sung]] had condemned all sorts of foreign languages (even the newly proposed [[New Korean Orthography]]). The ban continued into the 21st century. However, a textbook for university history departments containing 3,323 distinct characters was published in 1971.  In the 1990s, school children were still expected to learn 2,000 characters (more than in South Korea or Japan).{{sfn|Hannas|1997|p=68}}\n\nAfter [[Kim Jong Il]], the second ruler of North Korea, died in December 2011, [[Kim Jong Un]] stepped up and began mandating the use of Hanja as a source of definition for the Korean language. Currently, it is said that North Korea teaches around 3,000 Hanja characters to North Korean students, and in some cases, the characters appear within advertisements and newspapers. However, it is also said that the authorities implore students not to use the characters in public.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ko:\ubd81\ud55c\uc758 \ud55c\uc790\uc815\ucc45 \u2013 \"\u6f22\u5b57, 3000\uc790\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub418 \uc4f0\uc9c0\ub294 \ub9d0\ub77c\"|url=http://hanmunlove.nazero.net/bbs/zboard.php?id=hanmun5&page=12&sn1=&divpage=1&sn=off&ss=on&sc=on&select_arrange=headnum&desc=asc&no=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217174225/http://hanmunlove.nazero.net/bbs/zboard.php?id=hanmun5&page=12&sn1=&divpage=1&sn=off&ss=on&sc=on&select_arrange=headnum&desc=asc&no=4|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-12-17|date=2001-06-04|website=Han Mun Love|publisher=[[Chosun Ilbo]]|author=Kim Hye-jin|title = 404 Not Found|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref> Due to North Korea's strict isolationism, accurate reports about hanja use in North Korea are hard to obtain.\n\n===Okinawan===\n{{Main|Okinawan language}}\nChinese characters are thought to have been first introduced to the [[Ryukyu Islands]] in 1265 by a Japanese Buddhist monk.<ref>Hung, Eva and Judy Wakabayashi.

Most notably, the only surviving copies of ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'' were written in such a manner; the Chinese characters {{Lang|zh|\u5fd9\u8c41\u4f96\u7d10\u5bdf \u812b[\u535c]\u5bdf\u5b89}} is the rendering of ''Mong\u03b3ol-un ni\u03b3uca tob\u010diyan'', the title in Mongolian.\n\nHanzi was also used to phonetically transcribe the [[Manchu language]] in the [[Qing dynasty]].\n\nAccording to the Rev. John Gulick:  \"The inhabitants of other Asiatic nations, who have had occasion to represent the words of their several languages by Chinese characters, have as a rule used unaspirated characters for the sounds, g, d, b. The Muslims from Arabia and Persia have followed this method \u2026 The Mongols, Manchu, and Japanese also constantly select unaspirated characters to represent the sounds g, d, b, and j of their languages. These surrounding Asiatic nations, in writing Chinese words in their own alphabets, have uniformly used g, d, b, etc., to represent the unaspirated sounds.\"<ref>Rev. John Gulick (November 1870) [https://books.google.com/books?id=PcELAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA153#v=onepage&q&f=false \"On the best method of representing the unaspirated mutes of the Mandarin dialect,\"] ''The Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal'', vol. 3, pp. 153\u2013155.</ref>\n\n==Simplification==\n{{Main|Simplified Chinese character|Japanese script reform}}\nChinese character simplification is the overall<!--Overall. \u5f37\u5f3a, \u6b65\u6b69.--> reduction of the number of strokes in the [[regular script]] of a set of Chinese characters.\n\n===Simplification in China===\nThe use of traditional Chinese characters versus simplified Chinese characters varies greatly, and can depend on both the local customs and the medium. Before the official reform, character simplifications were not officially sanctioned and generally adopted vulgar variants and idiosyncratic substitutions. [[Vulgar variant|Orthodox variants]] were mandatory in printed works, while the (unofficial) simplified characters would be used in everyday writing or quick notes. Since the 1950s, and especially with the publication of the 1964 list, the [[People's Republic of China]] has officially adopted [[simplified Chinese characters]] for use in [[mainland China]], while [[Hong Kong]], Macau, and the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) were not affected by the reform. There is no absolute rule for using either system, and often it is determined by what the target audience understands, as well as the upbringing of the writer.\n\nAlthough most often associated with the People's Republic of China, character simplification predates the 1949 communist victory. [[Caoshu]], cursive written text, almost always includes character simplification, and simplified forms have always existed in print, albeit not for the most formal works. In the 1930s and 1940s, discussions on character simplification took place within the [[Kuomintang]] government, and a large number of Chinese intellectuals and writers have long maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in China. Indeed, this desire by the Kuomintang to simplify the Chinese writing system (inherited and implemented by the [[Communist Party of China]]) also nursed aspirations of some for the adoption of a phonetic script based on the [[Latin script]], and spawned such inventions as the [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]].\n\nThe People's Republic of China issued its first round of official character simplifications in two documents, the first in 1956 and the second in 1964. A [[Second-round simplified Chinese character|second round of character simplifications]] (known as ''erjian'', or \"second round simplified characters\") was promulgated in 1977. It was poorly received, and in 1986 the authorities rescinded the second round completely, while making six revisions to the 1964 list, including the restoration of three traditional characters that had been simplified: {{Lang|zh|\u53e0}} ''di\u00e9'', {{Lang|zh|\u8986}} ''f\u00f9'', {{Lang|zh|\u50cf}} ''xi\u00e0ng''.\n\nThe majority of simplified characters are drawn from conventional abbreviated forms, or ancient standard forms.{{sfn|Ramsey|1987|p=147}} For example, the orthodox character {{Lang|zh|\u4f86}} ''l\u00e1i'' (\"come\") was written with the structure {{Lang|zh|\u6765}} in the [[clerical script]] ({{Lang|zh|\u96b6\u4e66}} / {{Lang|zh|\u96b8\u66f8}}, ''l\u00ecsh\u016b'') of the [[Han dynasty]]. This clerical form uses one fewer stroke, and was thus adopted as a simplified form. The character {{Lang|zh|\u96f2}} ''y\u00fan'' (\"cloud\") was written with the structure {{Lang|zh|\u4e91}} in the [[oracle bone script]] of the [[Shang dynasty]], and had remained in use later as a phonetic loan in the meaning of \"to say\" while the {{Lang|zh|\u96e8}} [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] was added to differentiate meanings. The simplified form adopts the original structure.\n\n===Simplification in Japan===\n{{Main|Kanji|T\u014dy\u014d kanji|J\u014dy\u014d kanji|Shinjitai}}\n\nIn the years after [[World War II]], the [[Japanese government]] also instituted a series of orthographic reforms. Some characters were given simplified forms called {{nihongo||\u65b0\u5b57\u4f53|[[shinjitai]]|lit. \"new character forms\"}}; the older forms were then labelled the {{nihongo4||\u65e7\u5b57\u4f53|[[ky\u016bjitai]]|lit. \"old character forms\"}}. The number of characters in common use was restricted, and formal lists of characters to be learned during each grade of school were established, first the 1850-character {{nihongo4||\u5f53\u7528\u6f22\u5b57|[[t\u014dy\u014d kanji]]}} list in 1945, the 1945-character {{nihongo4||\u5e38\u7528\u6f22\u5b57|[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]}} list in 1981, and a 2136-character reformed version of the ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji'' in 2010. Many variant forms of characters and obscure alternatives for common characters were officially discouraged. This was done with the goal of facilitating learning for children and simplifying kanji use in literature and periodicals. These are simply guidelines, hence many characters outside these standards are still widely known and commonly used, especially those used for personal and place names (for the latter, see [[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]]),{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} as well as for some common words such as {{nihongo4|\"dragon\"|\u7adc/\u9f8d|tatsu}} in which both old and new forms of the character are both acceptable and widely known amongst native Japanese speakers.\n\n===Southeast Asian Chinese communities===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\n[[Singapore]] underwent three successive rounds of character simplification. These resulted in some simplifications that differed from those used in [[mainland China]]. It ultimately adopted the reforms of the People's Republic of China in their entirety as official, and has implemented them in the [[Education in Singapore|educational system]]. However, unlike in China, personal names may still be registered in traditional characters.\n\n[[Malaysia]] started teaching a set of simplified characters at schools in 1981, which were also completely identical to the Mainland China simplifications. Chinese newspapers in Malaysia are published in either set of characters, typically with the headlines in traditional Chinese while the body is in simplified Chinese.\n\nAlthough in both countries the use of simplified characters is universal among the younger Chinese generation, a large majority of the older Chinese literate generation still use the traditional characters. Chinese shop signs are also generally written in traditional characters.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], most Chinese schools and businesses still use the traditional characters and [[bopomofo]], owing from influence from the Republic of China (Taiwan) due to the shared [[Hokkien]] heritage. Recently, however, more Chinese schools now use both simplified characters and [[pinyin]]. Since most readers of Chinese newspapers in the Philippines belong to the older generation, they are still published largely using traditional characters.\n\n===North America===\nPublic and private Chinese signage in the United States and Canada most often use traditional characters.<ref>{{cite web |author= Vanessa Hua |url= http://m.sfgate.com/education/article/For-students-of-Chinese-politics-fill-the-2518868.php |title= For students of Chinese, politics fill the characters / Traditionalists bemoan rise of simplified writing system promoted by Communist government to improve literacy |publisher= M.sfgate.com |date= 2006-05-08 |accessdate= 2018-02-28}}</ref> There is some effort to get municipal governments to implement more simplified character signage due to recent immigration from mainland China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atanet.org/chronicle-online/wp-content/uploads/4111_20_mathew_kane.pdf |title=Chinese Character Usage in New York City |date= |accessdate=2019-07-22}}</ref> Most community newspapers printed in North America are also printed in traditional characters.\n\n===Comparisons of traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, and Japanese===\nThe following is a comparison of Chinese characters in the ''[[Standard Form of National Characters]]'', a common [[traditional Chinese]] standard used in Taiwan, the ''[[Table of General Standard Chinese Characters]]'', the standard for Mainland Chinese [[simplified Chinese|''jiantizi'']] (simplified), and the ''[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]'', the standard for Japanese [[kanji]]. Generally, the ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji'' are more similar to ''fantizi'' (traditional) than ''jiantizi''  are to ''fantizi''. \"Simplified\" refers to having significant differences from the Taiwan standard, not necessarily being a newly created character or a newly performed substitution. The characters in the [[List of Forms of Frequently Used Characters|Hong Kong standard]] and the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] are also known as \"Traditional,\" but are not shown.\n{{Chinese characters simplifications}}\n\n==Written styles==\n{{Main|Chinese script styles}}\n[[File:Treatise On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|right|Sample of the cursive script by Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] calligrapher [[Sun Guoting]], c. 650&nbsp;AD]]\n\nThere are numerous styles, or scripts, in which Chinese characters can be written, deriving from various calligraphic and historical models. Most of these originated in China and are now common, with minor variations, in all countries where Chinese characters are used.\n\nThe [[Shang dynasty]] [[oracle bone script]] and the [[Zhou dynasty]] scripts found on [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]] are no longer used; the oldest script that is still in use today is the [[Seal Script]] ({{zh|t=\u7bc6\u66f8|labels=no}}({{zh|s=\u7bc6\u4e66|labels=no}}), ''zhu\u00e0nsh\u016b''). It evolved organically out of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] Zhou script, and was adopted in a standardized form under the first [[Emperor of China]], [[Qin Shi Huang]]. The seal script, as the name suggests, is now used only in artistic seals. Few people are still able to read it effortlessly today, although the art of carving a traditional seal in the script remains alive; some [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphers]] also work in this style.\n\nScripts that are still used regularly are the \"[[Clerical Script]]\" ({{zh|t=\u96b8\u66f8|labels=no}}({{zh|s=\u96b6\u4e66|labels=no}}), ''l\u00ecsh\u016b'') of the [[Qin dynasty]] to the [[Han dynasty]], the [[Wei Monumental Script|Weibei]] ({{zh|t=\u9b4f\u7891|labels=no}}, ''w\u00e8ib\u0113i''), the \"[[Regular Script]]\" ({{zh|t=\u6977\u66f8|labels=no}}({{zh|s=\u6977\u4e66|labels=no}}), ''k\u01ceish\u016b''), which is used mostly for printing, and the \"[[Semi-cursive Script]]\" ({{zh|t=\u884c\u66f8|labels=no}}({{zh|s=\u884c\u4e66|labels=no}}), ''x\u00edngsh\u016b''), used mostly for handwriting.\n\nThe [[cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]] ({{zh|t=\u8349\u66f8|labels=no}}({{zh|s=\u8349\u4e66|labels=no}}), ''c\u01ceosh\u016b'', literally \"grass script\") is used informally. The basic character shapes are suggested, rather than explicitly realized, and the abbreviations are sometimes extreme. Despite being cursive to the point where individual strokes are no longer differentiable and the characters often illegible to the untrained eye, this script (also known as ''draft'') is highly revered for the beauty and freedom that it embodies. Some of the [[simplified Chinese characters]] adopted by the [[People's Republic of China]], and some simplified characters used in Japan, are derived from the cursive script. The Japanese ''[[hiragana]]'' script is also derived from this script.\n\nThere also exist scripts created outside China, such as the Japanese ''[[Edomoji]]'' styles; these have tended to remain restricted to their countries of origin, rather than spreading to other countries like the Chinese scripts.\n\n===Calligraphy===\n{{Main|Chinese calligraphy}}\n[[File:This Letter written by Mi Fei.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese calligraphy of mixed styles written by [[Song dynasty]] (1051\u20131108&nbsp;AD) poet [[Mi Fu|Mifu]]. For centuries, the Chinese literati were expected to master the art of calligraphy.]]\n\nThe art of writing Chinese characters is called '''Chinese calligraphy'''. It is usually done with [[ink brushes]]. In ancient China, Chinese calligraphy is one of the [[Four Arts of the Chinese Scholars]]. There is a minimalist set of rules of Chinese calligraphy. Every character from the Chinese scripts is built into a uniform shape by means of assigning it a geometric area in which the character must occur. Each character has a set number of brushstrokes; none must be added or taken away from the character to enhance it visually, lest the meaning be lost. Finally, strict regularity is not required, meaning the strokes may be accentuated for dramatic effect of individual style. Calligraphy was the means by which scholars could mark their thoughts and teachings for immortality, and as such, represent some of the most precious treasures that can be found from ancient China.\n\n===Typography and design===\n[[File:\u9f4a\u66f811.jpg|thumb|A page from a [[Ming dynasty]] edition of the [[Book of Qi]] ]]\n[[File:Chenzihmyon typefaces.svg|thumb|The first four characters of ''[[Thousand Character Classic]]'' in different type and [[Chinese script styles|script]] styles. From right to left: [[seal script]], [[clerical script]], [[regular script]], [[Ming (typeface)|Ming]] and [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|sans-serif]].]]\n[[File:\u6d59\u6c5f\u59d3\u89e31.jpeg|thumb|A page from a [[Song dynasty]] publication in a [[regular script]] typeface which resembles the handwriting of [[Ouyang Xun]] ]]\n\nThere are three major families of typefaces used in Chinese typography:\n* [[Ming (typeface)|Song/Ming]]\n* [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|Sans-serif]]\n* [[Regular script]]\n\nMing and sans-serif are the most popular in [[body text]] and are based on regular script for Chinese characters akin to Western [[serif]] and [[sans-serif]] typefaces, respectively. Regular script typefaces emulate [[regular script]].\n\nThe [[Ming (typeface)|''Song'' typeface]] ({{zh|s=\u5b8b\u4f53|labels=no}} / {{zh|t=\u5b8b\u9ad4|labels=no}}, ''s\u00f2ngt\u01d0'') is known as the ''Ming'' typeface ({{Nihongo2|\u660e\u671d}}, ''minch\u014d'') in Japan, and it is also somewhat more commonly known as the ''Ming'' typeface ({{zh|s=\u660e\u4f53|labels=no}} / {{zh|t=\u660e\u9ad4|labels=no}}, ''m\u00edngt\u01d0'') than the ''Song'' typeface in [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]]. The names of these styles come from the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, when [[block printing]] flourished in China.\n\n[[East Asian sans-serif typeface|Sans-serif]] typefaces, called black typeface ({{zh|s=\u9ed1\u4f53|labels=no}} / {{zh|t=\u9ed1\u9ad4|labels=no}}, ''h\u0113it\u01d0'') in Chinese and Gothic typeface ({{Nihongo2|\u30b4\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u4f53}}) in Japanese, are characterized by simple lines of even thickness for each stroke, akin to sans-serif styles such as [[Arial]] and [[Helvetica]] in Western typography.\n\n[[Regular script]] typefaces are also commonly used, but not as common as Ming or sans-serif typefaces for body text. Regular script typefaces are often used to teach students Chinese characters, and often aim to match the standard forms of the region where they are meant to be used. Most typefaces in the [[Song dynasty]] were regular script typefaces which resembled a particular person's handwriting (e.g. the handwriting of [[Ouyang Xun]], [[Yan Zhenqing]], or [[Liu Gongquan]]), while most modern regular script typefaces tend toward anonymity and regularity.\n\n==Variants==\n{{Main|Variant Chinese character}}\n[[File:Variations of the 213th Chinese radical, gui 'tortoise'.png|thumb|Variants of the Chinese character for ''gu\u012b'' 'turtle', collected c. 1800 from printed sources. The one at left is the traditional form used today in Taiwan and Hong Kong, {{zh|t=\u9f9c|labels=no}}, though {{zh|t=\u9f9c|labels=no}} may look slightly different, or even like the second variant from the left, depending on your font (see [[wikt:\u9f9c|Wiktionary]]). The modern simplified forms used in China, {{zh|s=\u9f9f|labels=no}}, and in Japan, {{Nihongo2|\u4e80}}, are most similar to the variant in the middle of the bottom row, though neither is identical. A few more closely resemble the modern simplified form of the character for ''di\u00e0n'' 'lightning', {{Lang|zh|\u7535}}.]]\n[[File:Four variant Chinese characters.png|thumb|Five of the 30 variant characters found in the preface of the ''Imperial (Kangxi) Dictionary'' which are not found in the dictionary itself.

(Although the form of {{Lang|zh|\u70ba}} is not very different, and in fact is used today in Japan, the radical {{Lang|zh|\u722a}} has been obliterated.) Another variant from the preface, {{Lang|zh|\u6765}} for {{Lang|zh|\u4f86}} ''l\u00e1i'' \"to come\", also not listed in the dictionary, has been adopted as the standard in Mainland China and Japan.]]\n[[File:CJK variant glyphs.png|right|thumb|The character {{Lang|zh|\u6b21}} in [[Simplified Chinese character|Simplified]] and [[Traditional Chinese character|Traditional]] Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. If you have an appropriate font installed, you can see the corresponding character in Vietnamese: <big>{{vi-nom|\u6b21}}</big>.]]\nJust as [[Roman letter]]s have a characteristic shape (lower-case letters mostly occupying the [[x-height]], with ascenders or descenders on some letters), Chinese characters occupy a more or less square area in which the components of every character are written to fit in order to maintain a uniform size and shape, especially with small printed characters in [[Ming (typeface)|Ming]] and [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|sans-serif]] styles. Because of this, beginners often practise writing on squared graph paper, and the Chinese sometimes use the term \"Square-Block Characters\" ({{zh|s=\u65b9\u5757\u5b57|labels=no}} / {{zh|t=\u65b9\u584a\u5b57|labels=no}}, ''f\u0101ngku\u00e0iz\u00ec''), sometimes translated as ''tetragraph'',<ref>{{cite web |title=danger + opportunity \u2260 crisis: How a misunderstanding about Chinese characters has led many astray |last=Mair |first=Victor H. |date=September 2009 |accessdate=August 20, 2010 |url=http://pinyin.info/chinese/crisis.html }}</ref> in reference to Chinese characters.\n\nDespite standardization, some nonstandard forms are commonly used, especially in handwriting. In older sources, even authoritative ones, variant characters are commonplace. For example, in the preface to the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary|Imperial Dictionary]]'', there are 30 variant characters which are not found in the dictionary itself.<ref>Montucci, 1817. ''Urh-ch\u012dh-tsze-t\u00eben-se-y\u012dn-pe-ke\u00e1ou; being a parallel drawn between the two intended Chinese dictionaries; by the Rev. Robert Morrison, and Antonio Montucci, LL. D.''</ref> A few of these are reproduced at right.\n\n===Regional standards===\nThe nature of Chinese characters makes it very easy to produce [[allograph]]s (variants) for many characters, and there have been many efforts at orthographical standardization throughout history. In recent times, the widespread usage of the characters in several nations has prevented any particular system becoming universally adopted and the standard form of many Chinese characters thus varies in different regions.\n\n[[Mainland China]] adopted [[simplified Chinese characters]] in 1956. They are also used in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]. [[Traditional Chinese characters]] are used in [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]]. Postwar Japan has used its own less drastically simplified characters, [[Shinjitai]], since 1946, while [[South Korea]] has limited its use of Chinese characters, and [[Vietnam]] and [[North Korea]] have completely abolished their use in favour of [[Vietnamese alphabet]] and [[Hangul]], respectively.\n\nThe standard character forms of each region are described in:\n* The [[List of Frequently Used Characters in Modern Chinese]] for Mainland China.\n* The [[List of Forms of Frequently Used Characters]] for Hong Kong.\n* The [[Standard Form of National Characters]] for Taiwan.\n* The list of [[J\u014dy\u014d kanji]] for Japan.\n* The [[Han-Han Dae Sajeon]] (''de facto'') for Korea.\n\nIn addition to strictness in character size and shape, Chinese characters are written with very precise rules. The most important rules regard the strokes employed, stroke placement, and [[stroke order]]. Just as each region that uses Chinese characters has standardized character forms, each also has standardized stroke orders, with each standard being different. Most characters can be written with just one correct stroke order, though some words also have many valid stroke orders, which may occasionally result in different stroke counts. Some characters are also written with different stroke orders due to character simplification.\n\n===Polysyllabic morphemes===\nChinese characters are primarily [[morphosyllabic]], meaning that most Chinese [[morpheme]]s are monosyllabic and are written with a single character, though in modern Chinese most ''words'' are disyllabic and dimorphemic, consisting of two syllables, each of which is a morpheme. In modern Chinese 10% of morphemes only occur as part of a given compound. However, a few morphemes are disyllabic, some of them dating back to Classical Chinese.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=8\u20139}} Excluding foreign loan words, these are typically words for plants and small animals. They are usually written with a pair of phono-semantic compound characters sharing a common radical. Examples are {{Lang|zh|\u8774\u8776}} ''h\u00fadi\u00e9'' \"butterfly\" and {{Lang|zh|\u73ca\u745a}} ''sh\u0101nh\u00fa'' \"coral\". Note that the {{Lang|zh|\u8774}} ''h\u00fa'' of ''h\u00fadi\u00e9'' and the {{Lang|zh|\u745a}} ''h\u00fa'' of ''sh\u0101nh\u00fa'' have the same phonetic, {{Lang|zh|\u80e1}}, but different radicals (\"insect\" and \"jade\", respectively). Neither exists as an independent morpheme except as a poetic abbreviation of the disyllabic word.\n\n===Polysyllabic characters===\nIn certain cases compound words and set phrases may be contracted into single characters. Some of these can be considered [[logogram]]s, where characters represent whole words rather than syllable-morphemes, though these are generally instead considered [[Chinese ligature|ligatures]] or abbreviations (similar to [[scribal abbreviations]], such as & for \"et\"), and as non-standard. These do see use, particularly in handwriting or decoration, but also in some cases in print. In Chinese, these ligatures are called ''h\u00e9w\u00e9n'' ({{Lang|zh|[[:zh:\u5408\u6587|\u5408\u6587]]}}), ''h\u00e9sh\u016b'' ({{Lang|zh|\u5408\u66f8}}) or h\u00e9t\u01d0z\u00ec ({{Lang|zh|\u5408\u4f53\u5b57}}), and in the special case of combining two characters, these are known as \"two-syllable Chinese characters\" ({{Lang|zh|\u53cc\u97f3\u8282\u6c49\u5b57}}, {{Lang|zh|\u96d9\u97f3\u7bc0\u6f22\u5b57}}).\n\nA commonly seen example is the [[Double Happiness (calligraphy)|double happiness]] symbol {{Lang|zh|\u56cd}}, formed as a ligature of {{Lang|zh|\u559c\u559c}} and referred to by its disyllabic name ({{zh|s=\u53cc\u559c|t=\u96d9\u559c|p=shu\u0101ngx\u01d0}}). In handwriting, numbers are very frequently squeezed into one space or combined \u2013 common ligatures include {{Lang|zh|\u5eff}} ''ni\u00e0n,'' \"twenty\", normally read as {{Lang|zh|\u4e8c\u5341}} ''\u00e8rsh\u00ed,'' {{Lang|zh|\u5345}} ''s\u00e0,'' \"thirty\", normally read as {{Lang|zh|\u4e09\u5341}} ''s\u0101nsh\u00ed,'' and {{Lang|zh|\u534c}} x\u00ec \"forty\", normally read as {{Lang|zh|\u56db\u5341}} \"s\u00ecsh\u00ed\". Calendars often use numeral ligatures in order to save space;  for example, the \"21st of March\" can be read as {{Lang|zh|\u4e09\u6708\u5eff\u4e00}}''.'' In some cases counters are also merged into one character, such as {{Lang|zh|\u4e03\u5341\u4eba}} ''q\u012bsh\u00ed r\u00e9n'' \"seventy people\". Another common abbreviation is {{Lang|zh|\u95e8}} with a \"T\" written inside it, for {{Lang|zh|\u554f\u984c}}, {{Lang|zh|\u95ee\u9898}}, ''w\u00e8nt\u00ed'' (\"question; problem\"), where the \"T\" is from pinyin for the second syllable ''t\u00ed'' {{Lang|zh|\u9898}}.<ref name=vmair/> Since polysyllabic characters are often non-standard, they are often excluded in character dictionaries.\n\nModern examples particularly include [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|Chinese characters]] for [[SI units]]. In Chinese these units are disyllabic and standardly written with two characters, as {{Lang|zh|\u5398\u7c73}} ''l\u00edm\u01d0'' \"centimeter\" ({{Lang|zh|\u5398}} centi-, {{Lang|zh|\u7c73}} meter) or {{Lang|zh|\u5343\u74e6}} ''qi\u0101nw\u01ce'' \"kilowatt\". However, in the 19th century these were often written via compound characters, pronounced disyllabically, such as {{Lang|zh|\u74e9}} for {{Lang|zh|\u5343\u74e6}} or {{Lang|zh|\u7cce}} for {{Lang|zh|\u5398\u7c73}} \u2013 some of these characters were also used in Japan, where they were pronounced with borrowed European readings instead. These have now fallen out of general use, but are occasionally seen. Less systematic examples include {{Lang|zh|\u5715}} ''t\u00fash\u016bgu\u01cen'' \"library\", a contraction of {{Lang|zh|\u5716\u66f8\u9928}},<ref>2006-04-21, [http://www.stnn.cc/culture/splend/t20060421_196261.html {{Lang|zh|\u201c\u5715\u201d\u5b57\u600e\u4e48\u5ff5\uff1f\u4ec0\u4e48\u610f\u601d\uff1f\u8c01\u9020\u7684\uff1f}}], Singtao Net</ref><ref>2009\u5e7403\u670820\u65e5, [http://news.xinhuanet.com/tw/2009-03/20/content_11038042.htm {{Lang|zh|\u201c\u5715\u201d\u5b57\u5b57\u600e\u4e48\u5ff5\uff1f\u53f0\u6559\u80b2\u90e8\u95e8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\u88ab\u8003\u5012}}], [[Xinhua News Agency]]</ref>\n\nThe use of such contractions is as old as Chinese characters themselves, and they have frequently been found in religious or ritual use. In the Oracle Bone script, personal names, ritual items, and even phrases such as {{Lang|zh|\u53d7\u53c8}}({{Lang|zh|\u7950}}) ''sh\u00f2u y\u00f2u'' \"receive blessings\" are commonly contracted into single characters. A dramatic example is that in medieval manuscripts {{zh|t=\u83e9\u85a9|labels=no}} ''p\u00fas\u00e0'' \"bodhisattva\" (simplified: {{zh|s=\u83e9\u8428|labels=no}}) is sometimes written with a single character formed of a 2\u00d72 grid of four {{Lang|zh|\u5341}} (derived from the grass radical over two {{Lang|zh|\u5341}}).<ref name=vmair>Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3330 \"Polysyllabic characters in Chinese writing\"], ''Language Log'', 2011 August 2</ref> However, for the sake of consistency and standardization, the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] seeks to limit the use of such polysyllabic characters in public writing to ensure that every character only has one syllable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3330|title=Polysyllabic characters in Chinese writing|website=Language Log|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref>\n\nConversely, with the fusion of the diminutive ''-er'' suffix in Mandarin, some monosyllabic words may even be written with two characters, as in {{Lang|zh|\u82b1\u513f}} ''hu\u0101r'' \"flower\", which was formerly disyllabic.\n\nIn most other languages that use the [[Chinese family of scripts]], notably Korean, Vietnamese, and Zhuang, Chinese characters are typically monosyllabic, but in Japanese a single character is generally used to represent a borrowed monosyllabic Chinese morpheme (the ''[[on'yomi]]''), a polysyllabic native Japanese morpheme (the ''[[kun'yomi]]''), or even (in rare cases) a foreign loanword. These uses are completely standard and unexceptional.\n\n===Rare and complex characters===\nOften a character not commonly used (a \"rare\" or \"variant\" character) will appear in a personal or place name in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese (see [[Chinese name]], [[Japanese name]], [[Korean name]], and [[Vietnamese name]], respectively). This has caused problems as many computer encoding systems include only the most common characters and exclude the less often used characters. This is especially a problem for personal names which often contain rare or classical, antiquated characters.\n\nOne man who has encountered this problem is Taiwanese politician [[Yu Shyi-kun]], due to the rarity of the last character in his name. Newspapers have dealt with this problem in varying ways, including using software to combine two existing, similar characters, including a picture of the personality, or, especially as is the case with Yu Shyi-kun, simply substituting a homophone for the rare character in the hope that the reader would be able to make the correct inference. Taiwanese political posters, movie posters etc. will often add the [[bopomofo]] phonetic symbols next to such a character. Japanese newspapers may render such names and words in [[katakana]] instead, and it is accepted practice for people to write names for which they are unsure of the correct kanji in katakana instead.\n\nThere are also some extremely complex characters which have understandably become rather rare. According to [[Jo\u00ebl Bellassen]] (1989), the most complex Chinese character is [[File:Zh\u00e9.svg|25px]]/{{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\ud869\udea5|\ud869\udea5]]}} (U+2A6A5) ''zh\u00e9'' {{Audio|zh-zhe2.ogg|listen}}, meaning \"verbose\" and containing sixty-four strokes; this character fell from use around the 5th century. It might be argued, however, that while containing the most strokes, it is not necessarily the most complex character (in terms of difficulty), as it simply requires writing the same sixteen-stroke character {{Lang|zh|\u9f8d}} ''l\u00f3ng'' (lit. \"dragon\") four times in the space for one. Another 64-stroke character is [[File:Zh\u00e8ng.svg|25px]]/{{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\ud841\udd3b|\ud841\udd3b]]}} (U+2053B) ''zh\u00e8ng'' composed of {{Lang|zh|\u8208}} ''x\u012bng/x\u00ecng'' (lit. \"flourish\") four times.\n\nOne of the most complex characters found in modern Chinese dictionaries{{efn|[[File:N\u00e0ng.svg|45px]] (U+9F49) ''n\u00e0ng'' is found, for instance, on p. 707 of {{Lang|zh|\u6f22\u82f1\u8fad\u5178(\u4fee\u8a02\u7248)}} ''A Chinese\u2013English Dictionary'', (Revised Edition) Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press, Beijing, 1995. {{ISBN|978-7-5600-0739-7}}.}} is {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u9f49|\u9f49]]}} (U+9F49) (''n\u00e0ng'', {{Audio|zh-nang4.ogg|listen}}, pictured below, middle image), meaning \"snuffle\" (that is, a pronunciation marred by a blocked nose), with \"just\" thirty-six strokes. Another stroke-rich character is \u9750 (''b\u00ecng''), with 39 strokes, meaning the loud noise thunder. However, these are not in common use. The most complex character that can be input using the Microsoft New Phonetic IME 2002a for traditional Chinese is {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u9f98|\u9f98]]}} (''d\u00e1'', \"the appearance of a dragon flying\"). It is composed of the dragon radical represented three times, for a total of 16 \u00d7 3 = 48 strokes. Among the most complex characters in modern dictionaries and also in ''frequent modern use'' are {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u7c72|\u7c72]]}} (''y\u00f9'', \"to implore\"), with 32 strokes; {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u9b31|\u9b31]]}} (''y\u00f9'', \"luxuriant, lush; gloomy\"), with 29 strokes, as in {{Lang|zh|\u6182\u9b31}} (''y\u014duy\u00f9'', \"depressed\"); {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u8c54|\u8c54]]}} (''y\u00e0n'', \"colorful\"), with 28 strokes; and {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u91c1|\u91c1]]}} (''x\u00ecn'', \"quarrel\"), with 25 strokes, as in {{Lang|zh|\u6311\u91c1}} (''ti\u01ceox\u00ecn'', \"to pick a fight\"). Also in occasional modern use is {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:\u9c7b|\u9c7b]]}} (''xi\u0101n'' \"fresh\"; variant of {{Lang|zh|\u9bae}} ''xi\u0101n'') with 33 strokes.\n\nIn [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]], an 84-stroke ''[[kokuji]]'' exists: [[File:Taito 1.svg|25px]], normally read ''[[Taito (kanji)|taito]]''. It is composed of three \"cloud\" ({{Nihongo2|\u96f2}}) characters on top of the abovementioned triple \"dragon\" character ({{Nihongo2|\u9f98}}). Also meaning \"the appearance of a dragon in flight\", it has been pronounced {{Nihongo2|\u304a\u3068\u3069}} ''otodo'', {{Nihongo2|[[:ja:\u305f\u3044\u3068|\u305f\u3044\u3068]]}} ''taito'', and {{Nihongo2|\u3060\u3044\u3068}} ''daito''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.sanseido-publ.co.jp/wp/2011/02/08/\u6f22\u5b57\u306e\u73fe\u5728\uff1a\u5e7d\u970a\u6587\u5b57\u304b\u3089\u30ad\u30e7\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u6587\u5b57\u3078\uff1f/| script-title =ja:Sanseido Word-Wise Web \uff3b\u4e09\u7701\u5802\u8f9e\u66f8\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\uff3d \u00bb \u6f22\u5b57\u306e\u73fe\u5728\uff1a\u5e7d\u970a\u6587\u5b57\u304b\u3089\u30ad\u30e7\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u6587\u5b57\u3078\uff1f|trans-title=From ghost character to vampire character?|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}</ref> The most elaborate character in the [[j\u014dy\u014d kanji list]] is the 29-stroke {{Nihongo2|\u9b31}}, meaning \"depression\" or \"melancholy\".\n\nThe most complex Chinese character still in use may be{{according to whom|date=March 2012}} ''bi\u00e1ng'' (pictured right, bottom), with 58 strokes, which refers to [[Biang biang noodles]], a type of noodle from [[China]]'s [[Shaanxi]] province. This character along with the syllable ''bi\u00e1ng'' cannot be found in dictionaries. The fact that it represents a syllable that does not exist in any [[Standard Chinese]] word means that it could be classified as a dialectal character.\n<!--\nIn contrast, the simplest character is {{Lang|zh|\u4e00}} ''y\u012b'' (\"one\") with just one horizontal stroke. The most common character in Chinese is {{Lang|zh|\u7684}} ''de'', a [[grammatical particle]] functioning as an adjectival marker and as a clitic genitive case analogous to the English ''\u2019s'', with eight strokes.

La Compagnie. {{ISBN|978-2-9504135-1-2}}.</ref> it is unclear, however, whether this average is weighted, or whether it includes traditional characters.\n\nAnother very simple Chinese character is {{zh|s=\u3007|labels=no}} ''(l\u00edng)'', the numeral [[0 (number)|zero]] in a positional system. For instance, the year 2000 would be {{zh|s=\u4e8c\u3007\u3007\u3007\u5e74|labels=no}}. It is not a typical character, but taken from the mathematical system of [[Counting rods|rod numerals]].

There are about 300 radicals and 100 are in common use. Creating a new character by modifying the radical is an easy way to disambiguate [[homograph]]s among ''x\u00edngsh\u0113ngz\u00ec'' pictophonetic compounds. This practice began long before the standardization of Chinese script by [[Qin Shi Huang]] and continues to the present day. The traditional 3rd-person pronoun ''t\u0101'' ({{Lang|zh|\u4ed6}} \"he, she, it\"), which is written with the \"person radical\", illustrates modifying significs to form new characters. In modern usage, there is a graphic distinction between ''t\u0101'' ({{Lang|zh|\u5979}} \"she\") with the \"woman radical\", ''t\u0101'' ({{Lang|zh|\u7260}} \"it\") with the \"animal radical\", ''t\u0101'' ({{Lang|zh|\u5b83}} \"it\") with the \"roof radical\", and ''t\u0101'' ({{Lang|zh|\u7942}} \"He\") with the \"deity radical\", One consequence of modifying radicals is the fossilization of rare and obscure variant logographs, some of which are not even used in [[Classical Chinese]]. For instance, ''he'' {{Lang|zh|\u548c}}  \"harmony, peace\", which combines the \"grain radical\" with the \"mouth radical\", has infrequent variants {{Lang|zh|\u548a}} with the radicals reversed and {{Lang|zh|\u9fa2}} with the \"flute radical\".\n\n===Chinese===\n[[File:Cumulative Hanzi frequency.svg|thumb|right|Cumulative frequency of simplified Chinese characters in Modern Chinese text<ref>Da Jun (2004), [http://lingua.mtsu.edu/chinese-computing/ Chinese text computing].</ref>]]\nChinese characters should not be confused with Chinese words, as the majority of modern Chinese words, unlike their [[Old Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]] counterparts, are written with two or more characters, each character representing one syllable and/or [[morpheme]]. Knowing the meanings of the individual characters of a word will often allow the general meaning of the word to be inferred, but this is not always the case.\n\nStudies in China have shown that literate individuals know and use between 3,000 and 4,000 characters.  Specialists in classical literature or history, who would often encounter characters no longer in use, are estimated to have a working vocabulary of between 5,000 and 6,000 characters.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=73}}\n\nIn [[China]], which uses [[simplified Chinese characters]], the ''[[Xi\u00e0nd\u00e0i H\u00e0ny\u01d4 Ch\u00e1ngy\u00f2ng Z\u00ecbi\u01ceo]]'' ({{Lang|zh-Hans-CN|\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c49\u8bed\u5e38\u7528\u5b57\u8868}}, Chart of Common Characters of Modern Chinese) lists 2,500 common characters and 1,000 less-than-common characters, while the ''Xi\u00e0nd\u00e0i H\u00e0ny\u01d4 T\u014dngy\u00f2ng Z\u00ecbi\u01ceo'' ({{Lang|zh-Hans-CN|\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c49\u8bed\u901a\u7528\u5b57\u8868}}, Chart of Generally Utilized Characters of Modern Chinese) lists 7,000 characters, including the 3,500 characters already listed above.

In general, it is common practice to use standard characters to transcribe Chinese dialects when obvious cognates with words in Standard Mandarin exist.  However, when no obvious cognate could be found for a word, due to factors like irregular sound change or semantic drift in the meanings of characters, or the word originates from a non-Chinese source like a substratum from an earlier displaced language or a later borrowing from another language family, then characters are borrowed and used according to the rebus principle or invented in an ''ad hoc'' manner to transcribe it.  These new characters are generally phonosemantic compounds (e.g., \u4fac, 'person' in Min), although a few are compound ideographs (e.g., \u5b6c, 'bad', in Northeast Mandarin). Except in the case of Written Cantonese, there is no official orthography, and there may be several ways to write a dialectal word, often one that is etymologically correct and one or several that are based on the current pronunciation (e.g., \u89e6\u796d (etymological) vs. \u6233\u9e21 (phonetic), 'eat' (low-register) in Shanghainese).  Speakers of a dialect will generally recognize a dialectal word if it is transcribed according to phonetic considerations, while the etymologically correct form may be more difficult or impossible to recognize.  For example, few Gan speakers would recognize the character meaning 'to lean' in their dialect, because this character (\u9691) has become archaic in Standard Mandarin. The historically \"correct\" transcription is often so obscure that it is uncovered only after considerable scholarly research into philology and historical phonology and may be disputed by other researchers.\n\nAs an exception, [[Written Cantonese]] is in widespread use in [[Hong Kong]], even for certain formal documents, due to the former British [[colony|colonial]] administration's recognition of Cantonese for use for official purposes. In Taiwan, there is also a body of semi-official characters used to represent [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]].  For example, the vernacular character {{Lang|zh|\u34fe}}, pronounced ''cii<sup>11</sup>'' in [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], means \"to kill\".<ref>[http://hakka.dict.edu.tw/hakkadict/result.jsp?page=1&sample=\u982d Hakka Dictionary]</ref> Other varieties of Chinese with a significant number of speakers, like [[Shanghainese]] Wu, [[Gan Chinese]], and [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuanese]], also have their own series of characters, but these are not often seen, except on advertising billboards directed toward locals and are not used in formal settings except to give precise transcriptions of witness statements in legal proceedings.  Written Standard Mandarin is the preference for all mainland regions.\n\n===Japanese===\n\nIn Japanese there are 2,136 ''[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5e38\u7528\u6f22\u5b57}}, lit. \"frequently used Chinese characters\") designated by the [[Japanese Ministry of Education]]; these are taught during primary and secondary school. The list is a recommendation, not a restriction, and many characters missing from it are still in common use.<ref>{{cite web|title=What are the J\u014dy\u014d Kanji?|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/jouyou-kanji.html|website=sci.lang.japan FAQ|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne area where character usage is officially restricted is in names, which may contain only government-approved characters. Since the ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji'' list excludes many characters that have been used in personal and place names for generations, an additional list, referred to as the  ''[[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u4eba\u540d\u7528\u6f22\u5b57}}, lit. \"kanji for use in personal names\"), is published.<ref>{{cite web|title=What are the Jinmeiy\u014d Kanji?|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/jinmeiyou-kanji.html|website=sci.lang.japan FAQ|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref> It currently contains 983 characters.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nToday, a well-educated Japanese person may know upwards of 3,500 characters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The ''[[kanji kentei]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c\u6f22\u5b57\u80fd\u529b\u691c\u5b9a\u8a66\u9a13}}, ''Nihon Kanji N\u014dryoku Kentei Shiken'' or ''Test of Japanese Kanji Aptitude'') tests a speaker's ability to read and write kanji. The highest level of the ''kanji kentei'' tests on approximately 6,000 kanji,<ref>{{cite web|title=Kanji Kentei|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kanji-kentei.html|website=sci.lang.japan FAQ|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Koichi|title=The Ultimate Kanji Test: Kanji Kentei|url=http://www.tofugu.com/2011/04/06/kanji-kentei-test/|website=Tofugu|accessdate=11 November 2015|date=2011-04-06}}</ref> though in practice few people attain (or need to attain) this level.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Modern creation===\nNew characters can in principle be coined at any time, just as new words can be, but they may not be adopted. Significant historically recent coinages date to scientific terms of the 19th century. Specifically, Chinese coined new characters for chemical elements \u2013 see [[chemical elements in East Asian languages]] \u2013 which continue to be used and taught in schools in China and Taiwan. In Japan, in the [[Meiji era]] (specifically, late 19th century), new characters were coined for some (but not all) SI units, such as {{Nihongo2|\u7c81}} ({{Nihongo2|\u7c73}} \"meter\" + {{Nihongo2|\u5343}} \"thousand, kilo-\") for kilometer. These [[kokuji]] (Japanese-coinages) have found use in China as well \u2013 see [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|Chinese characters for SI units]] for details.\n\nWhile new characters can be easily coined by writing on paper, they are difficult to represent on a computer \u2013 they must generally be represented as a picture, rather than as text \u2013 which presents a significant barrier to their use or widespread adoption. Compare this with the use of symbols as names in 20th century musical albums such as ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' (1971) and ''[[Love Symbol Album]]'' (1993); an album cover may potentially contain any graphics, but in writing and other computation these symbols are difficult to use.\n\n==Indexing==\nDozens of indexing schemes have been created for arranging Chinese characters in [[Chinese dictionary|Chinese dictionaries]]. The great majority of these schemes have appeared in only a single dictionary; only one such system has achieved truly widespread use. This is the system of [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] (see for example, the 214 so-called [[Kangxi radical]]s).\n\nChinese character dictionaries often allow users to locate entries in several ways. Many Chinese, Japanese, and Korean dictionaries of Chinese characters list characters in radical order: characters are grouped together by radical, and radicals containing fewer [[stroke (Chinese character)|strokes]] come before radicals containing more strokes ([[radical-and-stroke sorting]]). Under each radical, characters are listed by their total number of strokes. It is often also possible to search for characters by sound, using [[pinyin]] (in Chinese dictionaries), [[bopomofo|zhuyin]] (in Taiwanese dictionaries), [[kana]] (in Japanese dictionaries) or [[hangul]] (in Korean dictionaries). Most dictionaries also allow searches by total number of strokes, and individual dictionaries often allow other search methods as well.\n\nFor instance, to look up the character where the sound is not known, e.g., {{Lang|zh|\u677e}} (pine tree), the user first determines which part of the character is the radical (here {{Lang|zh|\u6728}}), then counts the number of strokes in the radical (four), and turns to the radical index (usually located on the inside front or back cover of the dictionary). Under the number \"4\" for radical stroke count, the user locates {{Lang|zh|\u6728}}, then turns to the page number listed, which is the start of the listing of all the characters containing this radical. This page will have a sub-index giving remainder stroke numbers (for the non-radical portions of characters) and page numbers. The right half of the character also contains four strokes, so the user locates the number 4, and turns to the page number given. From there, the user must scan the entries to locate the character he or she is seeking. Some dictionaries have a sub-index which lists every character containing each radical, and if the user knows the number of strokes in the non-radical portion of the character, he or she can locate the correct page directly.\n\nAnother dictionary system is the [[four corner method]], where characters are classified according to the shape of each of the four corners.\n\nMost modern Chinese dictionaries and Chinese dictionaries sold to English speakers use the traditional radical-based character index in a section at the front, while the main body of the dictionary arranges the main character entries alphabetically according to their [[pinyin]] spelling.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} To find a character with unknown sound using one of these dictionaries, the reader finds the radical and stroke number of the character, as before, and locates the character in the radical index. The character's entry will have the character's pronunciation in pinyin written down; the reader then turns to the main dictionary section and looks up the pinyin spelling alphabetically.\n\n==See also==\n{{sister project|project=wiktionary|text=[[:Wiktionary:Index:Chinese radical|Radical index]] on ''[[Wiktionary]]''}}\n{{sister project|project=wiktionary|text=[[:Wiktionary:Index:Chinese total strokes|Total strokes index]] on ''[[Wiktionary]]''}}\n* [[Adoption of Chinese literary culture]]\n* [[Chinese family of scripts]]\n* [[Character amnesia]]\n* [[Chinese character encoding]]\n* [[Chinese input methods for computers]]\n* [[Chinese numerals|Chinese numerals, or how to write numbers with Chinese characters]]\n* [[Chinese punctuation]]\n* [[Eight Principles of Yong]]\n* [[Stroke order]]\n* [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts]]\n* [[List of languages by writing system#Chinese characters and derivatives|List of languages written in Chinese characters and derivatives of Chinese characters]]\n* [[Romanization of Chinese]]\n* [[Transcription into Chinese characters]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n{{PD-old-text | title = The Chinese recorder and missionary journal, Volume 3 | year = 1871 | author = }}\n{{refbegin|indent=yes|30em}}\n<!-- Please use {Cite book} & {Cite web} templates -->\n* {{cite book | title = A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology | given = William H. | surname = Baxter | author-link = William H.

The house was built in 1874 by an unknown architect for [[Stephen A. Race]]. It was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] on September 22, 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/R/RaceHouse.html|title=Race House|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607155206/http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/R/RaceHouse.html|archivedate=2007-06-07}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThis home is significant in the history of Chicago and the neighborhood of Irving Park.  It is the only remaining home of the original founders of Irving Park \u2013 the Race family.  The Stephen A. Race house is a rare Chicago example of a red brick Italianate structure with its architectural integrity for the most part still intact.  Originally sited on Irving Park Boulevard, a road that was once an Indian trail in early Illinois, the home's style is especially representative of the type of grand residential dwellings that once lined Irving Park Boulevard in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, when Irving Park was a suburban/country retreat.\n\nWhen originally built, the home cost $12,000 \u2013 a significant amount of money in 1873.  The Charles T. Race House, which no longer exists, was slightly grander in scale and cost $15,000.  Both homes were of the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] style, one of the most popular architectural styles between 1850 and 1880.  While the architect's name is unknown to us today, the similarities of the Race homes indicate the brothers used the same architect.\n\n==Description==\nThe Stephen A. Race House is a classic [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] Italianate \u2013 built from 1873 to 1874 for Stephen A. Race, one of the founders of Irving Park, along with his brother, Charles T. Race, principal founder and developer of Irving Park.\n\nFour stories high, the Stephen A. Race House is composed of red brick contrasted with white limestone and painted wood trim; its style is derived from the villas of [[Tuscany, Italy|Tuscany]] in [[Northern Italy]], which are characterized by a symmetrical box shape capped by a flat roof.  Large eave brackets dominate the cornice line of Italianate houses.  On the Race House, these are over-scaled, elaborately scrolled and arranged in pairs \u2013 typical of this era and style.\n\nParticularly arresting is the treatment of the windows on the second level.  Tall and thin, with two-over-two lights, they are emphatically framed with semi-circular arches stamped by a prominent limestone [[keystone (architecture)|keystone]].\n\n===Alterations===\nThe exterior of the first floor of this home has been altered, most probably when it was moved early in the 20th century (a historic plaque outside the home states 1924, but other sources mention 1905).  You'll note that breaking the straightforward configuration of the house is a large [[bay window]] \u2013 a late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] addition.  This bay window replaced two tall windows on the first floor that aligned and fell directly below the two second floor windows on the left.  Up on the porch you can see the placement of the original windows if you look at the [[Indiana Limestone|Indiana limestone]] blocks that line the perimeter of the home on the first level.  The exterior front doors were also most likely modified during this period.  Originally, the exterior set of doors would have echoed the arched doorway and doors of the interior set.\n\nThe front porch on the home is not original.  It was built in 2001 and is a replica of the porch that previously fronted the home, and which was most built after the home was moved from Irving Park Boulevard and onto Tripp Avenue.  Originally, the home had a [[Cast-iron architecture|cast-iron]] staircase, resting on a limestone base, probably about the same width of the existing staircase that would have led to a landing and the double front doors.\n\nIt is thought that the windows, porch and doors were all modified at the same time to coincide with the movement of the house \u2013 and updated to reflect the tastes of the [[Late Victorian|late Victorian era]].\n\nTo fully appreciate this house, it is best to remember that it was moved from its original position on Irving Park Boulevard on what was then a more spacious landscaped lot.  The home is still sited on a portion of the original lot, but was pivoted 90 degrees, so that instead of facing north, it now faces west.  It was moved as Irving Park Boulevard became more commercial.  Facing Irving Park Boulevard, the home and its lot occupied half of the north-facing block.  Where the house is now located was most probably where the stables and out buildings of the home would have been located.  Using the city lot maps of today, this home occupied what are now five city lots.\n\nIt was during this commercial building boom along Irving Park Boulevard that its companion house, the Charles T. Race home, was demolished.  The home has undergone some changes in nearly 140 years, but luckily, those changes have not impacted the architectural integrity of the home significantly.  Mark Gregory Jones and Bradley Maury purchased the house in 2002 and completed extensive restoration and renovation of the home, and transformed the previously unfinished third floor walk-up attic into a master suite. Jones and Maury retained the property for 12 years before selling the home in 2014 to Chris and Alison Domino. The Dominos sold the home in 2019 to the current owners, Dana and Drew Sarros.\n\nThe stained glass in the front living room window was installed in 2002 and is a reproduction of the original [[stained glass]] panel, with the exception of the colors.  The current owners were able to locate a black and white photograph, which provided the template for this recreating this stained glass panel.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the home was abandoned and in disrepair, four white [[Carrara marble]] fireplace mantels, along with the newel post for the front hall, were stolen.  All the fireplaces have been replaced with fireplaces of the period however and the newel post replaced with a similar period piece.  The woodwork throughout the house is painted and is of a very robust and exuberant style, which is typical of Italianate homes of this period.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\nHistory of the Stephen A.
