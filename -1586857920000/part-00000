Cosell became prominent and influential during his tenure with [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio]] and [[ABC Sports]] from 1953 until 1985.\n\nCosell was widely known for his blustery, confident personality.<ref name=obit/> Cosell said of himself, \"Arrogant, pompous, obnoxious, vain, cruel, verbose, a showoff.

He graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in English from [[New York University]], where he was a member of [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity and [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He then earned a law degree at [[New York University School of Law]], where he was a member of the law review.\n\nThe name of Cosell's grandfather was changed by immigration authorities when he entered the United States; Howard Cosell said he changed his name from \"Cohen\" to \"Cosell\" while a law student as a way to honor his father and grandfather by reverting to a version of his family's original [[Polish language|Polish]] name.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=John |date=2010 |title=There You Have it: The Life, Legacy, and Legend of Howard Cosell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRirlKfG3J0C&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=howard%20cosell%20changed%20name%20polish |location=Amherst, MA |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |page=67 |isbn=978-1-55849-837-2}}</ref>\n\n===Military service===\nCosell was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in the state of New York in 1941, but when the United States entered [[World War II]] at the end of that year he was commissioned in the [[United States Army]] as an officer with its [[United States Army Transportation Corps|Transportation Corps]]. In 1944 he married Mary Edith Abrams in a judge's chambers in [[Brooklyn]]. At the war's conclusion in 1945, he was discharged from the United States Army with the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]].\n\n===Early legal career===\nAfter the war, Cosell began practicing law in [[Manhattan]], primarily union law. Some of his clients were actors, and some were athletes, including [[Willie Mays]]. Cosell's own hero in athletics was [[Jackie Robinson]], who served as a personal and professional inspiration to him in his career.\n\n==Career==\n===Introduction to broadcasting===\nCosell represented the [[Little League]] of New York, when in 1953, Hal Neal (president ABC Radio), then an [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] manager, asked him to host a show on New York flagship [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] featuring Little League participants. The show marked the beginning of a relationship with WABC and ABC Radio that would last his entire broadcasting career.\n\nCosell hosted the Little League show for three years without pay, and then decided to leave the law to become a full-time broadcaster. He approached [[Robert Pauley]], President of ABC Radio, with a proposal for a weekly show. Pauley told him the network could not afford to develop untried talent, but he would be put on the air if he would get a sponsor. To Pauley's surprise, Cosell came back with a relative's shirt company as a sponsor, and \"Speaking of Sports\" was born.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/business/media/14pauley.html Robert Pauley, Former Head of ABC Radio, Dies at 85], ''The New York Times'', May 14, 2009.</ref>\n\nCosell took his \"tell it like it is\" approach when he teamed with the ex\u2013[[Brooklyn Dodgers]] pitcher \"Big ''Numba'' Thirteen\" [[Ralph Branca]] on WABC's pre- and post-game [[Radio programming|radio shows]] of the [[New York Mets]] in their nascent years beginning in 1962. He pulled no punches in taking members of the hapless [[expansion team]] to task.\n\nOtherwise on radio, Cosell did his show, ''Speaking of Sports'', as well as sports reports and updates for affiliated [[radio station]]s around the country; he continued his radio duties even after he became prominent on television. Cosell then became a sports anchor at [[WABC-TV]] in New York, where he served in that role from 1961 to 1974. He expanded his commentary beyond sports to a radio show entitled ''Speaking of Everything''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1987/09/02/cosell-gets-back-in-the-picture/61f7b279-6f64-442c-8e73-3af9caccf4e2/|title=COSELL GETS BACK IN THE PICTURE|first=Norman|last=Chad|date=September 2, 1987|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to prominence, supports black athletes===\nCosell rose to prominence in the early-1960s, covering boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], beginning from the time he fought under his [[Name at birth|birth name]], Cassius Clay. The two seemed to have an affinity despite their different personalities, and complemented each other in broadcasts. Cosell was one of the first sportscasters to refer to the boxer as Muhammad Ali after he changed his name, and supported him when he refused to be inducted into the military. Cosell was also an outspoken supporter of Olympic sprinters [[John Carlos]] and [[Tommie Smith]], after they raised their fists in a [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|\"black power\" salute during their 1968 medal ceremony]] in [[Mexico City]]. In a time when many sports broadcasters avoided touching social, racial, or other controversial issues, and kept a certain level of collegiality towards the sports figures they commented on, Cosell did not, and indeed built a reputation around his [[catchphrase]], \"I'm just telling it like it is.\"\n\nCosell's style of reporting transformed [[sports broadcasting]] in the United States. Whereas previous sportscasters had mostly been known for [[color commentary]] and lively [[play-by-play]], Cosell had an intellectual approach. His use of analysis and context brought television sports reporting closer to \"hard\" news reporting. However, his distinctive [[staccato]] voice, [[New York City English|accent]], [[syntax]], and [[cadence (music)|cadence]] were a form of color commentary all their own.\n\nCosell earned his greatest interest from the public when he backed Ali after the boxer's championship title was stripped from him for refusing military service during the [[Vietnam War]]. Cosell found vindication several years later when he was able to inform Ali that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] had unanimously ruled in favor of Ali in ''[[Clay v. United States]]''.\n\nCosell called most of Ali's fights immediately before and after the boxer returned from his three-year exile in October 1970. Those fights were broadcast on taped delay usually a week after they were transmitted on closed circuit. However, Cosell did not call two of Ali's biggest fights, the [[Rumble in the Jungle]] in October 1974 and the first [[Fight of the Century|Ali\u2013Joe Frazier bout]] in March 1971. Promoter [[Jerry Perenchio]] selected actor [[Burt Lancaster]], who had never provided color commentary for a fight, to work the bout with longtime announcer [[Don Dunphy]] and former light-heavyweight champion [[Archie Moore]]. Cosell attended that fight as a spectator only. He would do a [[voice-over]] of that bout, when it was shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] a few days before the second [[Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II|Ali-Frazier bout]] in January 1974.\n\nPerhaps his most famous call took place in the [[George Foreman#The Sunshine Showdown vs. Joe Frazier|fight]] between [[Joe Frazier]] and [[George Foreman]] for the World Heavyweight Championship in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in 1973. When Foreman knocked Frazier to the mat the first of six times, roughly two minutes into the first round, Cosell yelled out:\n\n{{quote|Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier!}}\n\nHis call of Frazier's first trip to the mat became one of the most quoted phrases in American sports broadcasting history. Foreman beat Frazier by a [[Technical knockout|TKO]] in the second round to win the [[World heavyweight boxing championship|World Heavyweight Championship]].\n\nCosell provided blow-by-blow commentary for ABC of some of boxing's biggest matches during the 1970s and the early-1980s, including [[Ken Norton]]'s upset win over Ali in 1973 and Ali's defeat of [[Leon Spinks]] in 1978 recapturing the heavyweight title for the third time. His signature [[toupee]] was unceremoniously knocked off in front of live ABC cameras when a scuffle broke out after a broadcast match between [[Scott LeDoux]] and Johnny Boudreaux. Cosell quickly retrieved his hairpiece and replaced it. During interviews in studio with Ali, the champion would tease and threaten to remove the hairpiece with Cosell playing along but never allowing it to be touched. On one of these occasions, Ali quipped, \"Cosell, you're a phony, and that thing on your head comes from the tail of a pony.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5294873|title=Ali and Cosell, Irresistible Enigmas|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\nWith typical headline generating drama, Cosell abruptly ended his broadcast association with the sport of boxing while providing coverage for ABC for the heavyweight championship bout between [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] on November 26, 1982. Halfway through the bout and with Cobb absorbing a beating, Cosell stopped providing anything more than rudimentary comments about round number and the participants punctuated with occasional declarations of disgust during the 15 rounds. He declared shortly after the fight to a national television audience that he had broadcast his last professional boxing match.\n\nCosell also was an ABC commentator for the television broadcast of the second of the two famous 1973 \"[[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battles of the Sexes]]\" tennis matches, this one between [[Bobby Riggs]] and [[Billie Jean King]].\n\n===Feuds===\nDuring Cosell's tenure as a sportscaster, he frequently clashed with longtime ''[[New York Daily News]]'' sports columnist [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]], who rarely missed an opportunity to denigrate the broadcaster in print as an \"ass\", a \"shill\", or most often, \"Howie the Fraud\". Young would sometimes stand near Cosell and shout profanities so that the audio he was taping for his radio show would be unusable. Writing about Cosell, sportswriter [[Jimmy Cannon]] sniped, \"This is a guy who changed his name, put on a toupee and tried to convince the world that he tells it like it is.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105742,00.html |title=The Mouth That Roared|author=William Plummer|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref> He further added, \"If Howard Cosell were a sport, he'd be [[roller derby]].\"<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1006539/index.htm Nack, William. \"Telling It Like It Is\", ''Sports Illustrated'', May 1, 1995].</ref>\n\nCosell, according to longtime [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[racecaster]] [[Chris Economaki]], \"had an enormous and monumental ego, and may have been the most pompous man I've ever met.\" Cosell ripped Economaki for a miscue in an interview with [[Cale Yarborough]] for ABC \"(and he) never let me forget that\". At an ABC [[Christmas]] party Economaki's wife asked to be introduced to Cosell and Chris said, \"{{'}}Howard, for some inexplicable reason my wife wants to meet you...' and it (ticked) him off to no end. He really took it personally.\"<ref>Economaki, Chris (with Dave Argabright) (2006) ''LET 'EM ALL GO! The Story of Auto Racing by the Man Who Was There'' (Fisher, IN: Books By Dave Argabright), p. 191. {{ISBN|0-9719639-3-2}}.</ref>\n\n===''Monday Night Football''===\nIn [[1970 NFL season|1970]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[executive producer]] for sports [[Roone Arledge]] hired Cosell to be a [[color commentator|commentator]] for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (MNF), the first time in 15 years that [[American football]] was broadcast weekly in [[prime time]]. Cosell was accompanied most of the time by ex-football players [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Don Meredith|\"Dandy\" Don Meredith]].\n\nCosell was openly contemptuous of ex-athletes appointed to prominent sportscasting roles solely on account of their playing fame. He regularly clashed on-air with Meredith, whose laid-back style was in sharp contrast to Cosell's more critical approach to the games.\n\nThe Cosell-Meredith-Gifford dynamic helped make ''Monday Night Football'' a success; it frequently was the number one rated program in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. Cosell's inimitable style distinguished ''Monday Night Football'' from previous sports programming, and ushered in an era of more colorful broadcasters and [[24/7 service|24/7]] TV sports coverage.\n\nIt was during his ''MNF'' run that Cosell coined a phrase that came to be so identified with football that other announcers and spectators\u2014notably [[Chris Berman]]\u2014began to repeat it. An ordinary kickoff return began with Cosell giving commentary about a player's difficult life. It became extraordinary when he suddenly observed, \"He could go all the way!\" As evidenced by the thousands of websites that cite Cosell's quote, many sports commentators consider this to be one of the most famous sports quips of all time.\n\nAlso during his ''MNF'' run, after a 4 September 1978 NFL game, Cosell popularized the term \"[[nachos]]\".<ref>{{cite web | last = Munsey | last2 = Suppes | title = Arlington Stadium | work = Ballparks| url = http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/arling.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===Olympics===\nAlong with ''Monday Night Football'', Cosell worked the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] for [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]]. He played a key role on ABC's coverage of the [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian terror]] group [[Black September (group)|Black September]]'s [[mass murder]] of [[Israel]]i athletes in [[Munich massacre|Munich]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]; providing reports directly from the [[Olympic Park|Olympic Village]] (his image can be seen and voice heard in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Munich (film)|film]] about the terror attack).\n\nIn the [[Boxing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Games in Montreal]], and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 games in Los Angeles]], Cosell was the main voice for boxing. [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] won the gold medal in his light welterweight class at Montreal, beginning his meteoric rise to a world professional title a few years later, and Cosell became close to Leonard, during this period, announcing many of his fights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"I Never Played The Game\", by Howard Cosell, 1985</ref>\n\n===\"The Bronx is burning\"===\nCosell was widely attributed with saying the famous phrase \"the Bronx is burning\". Cosell is credited with saying the quote during Game 2 of the [[1977 World Series]], which took place in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] on October 12, 1977. For a couple of years, fires had routinely erupted in the South [[The Bronx|Bronx]], mostly due to owners of low-value properties burning their own real estate for [[insurance]] money. During the bottom of the first inning, an ABC aerial camera panned a few blocks from Yankee Stadium to a building on fire. The scene became a defining image of New York City in the 1970s. Cosell supposedly stated, \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen, The Bronx is burning.\"<ref name=nypost>{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2010/05/16/why-the-bronx-burned/ | work=New York Post | first=Joe | last=Flood | title=Why the Bronx Burned | date=May 16, 2010}}</ref> This was later picked up by presidential candidate [[Ronald Reagan]], who then made a special trip to the Bronx, to illustrate the failures of politicians to address the issues in that part of New York City.\n\nIn 2005, author Jonathan Mahler published ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning]]'', a book about New York in 1977, and credited Cosell with the title quote during the aerial coverage of the fire. [[ESPN]] produced a 2007 [[Miniseries|mini-series]] based on the book ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]''. Cosell's comment seemed to have captured the widespread view that New York City was in a state of decline.\n\nThe truth was discovered after Major League Baseball published a complete DVD set of all of the games of the 1977 World Series. Coverage of the fire began with [[Keith Jackson]]'s comments regarding the enormity of the blaze, while Cosell added that [[Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter]] had visited that area just days before. At the top of the second inning, the fire was once again shown from a helicopter-mounted camera, and Cosell commented that the [[New York City Fire Department|New York Fire Department]] had a hard job to do in the Bronx as there were always numerous fires. In the bottom of the second, Cosell informed the audience that it was an abandoned building that was burning and no lives were in danger. There was no further comment on the fire, and Cosell appears to have never said \"The Bronx is Burning\" (at least not on camera) during Game 2.<ref name=nypost/>\n\nMahler's confusion could have arisen from a 1974 documentary entitled ''The Bronx Is Burning'': it is likely Mahler confused the documentary with his recollection of Cosell's comments when writing his book.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bestblog.mlblogs.com/archives/2007/08/did_howard_cose_1.html |title=Did Howard Cosell Really Say, \"The Bronx Is Burning\"?|accessdate=2009-12-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213023329/http://bestblog.mlblogs.com/archives/2007/08/did_howard_cose_1.html |archivedate=December 13, 2010  }}</ref>\n\n===Reports the death of John Lennon===\n{{main|Murder of John Lennon}}\nOn the night of December 8, 1980, during a ''Monday Night Football'' game between the [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and the [[1980 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], Cosell shocked the television audience by interrupting his regular commentary duties to deliver a news bulletin on the murder of [[John Lennon]] in the midst of a live broadcast. Word had been passed to Cosell and Frank Gifford by [[Roone Arledge]], who was president of ABC's news and sports divisions at the time, near the end of the game.\n\nCosell was initially apprehensive about announcing Lennon's death. Off the air, Cosell conferred with Gifford and others saying \"Fellas, I just don't know, I'd like your opinion. I can't see this game situation allowing for that news flash, can you?\" Gifford replied, \"Absolutely. I can see it.\" Gifford later told Cosell, \"Don't hang on it. It's a tragic moment and this is going to shake up the whole world.\"\n\nOn air, Gifford prefaced the announcement saying, \"And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, you have got to say what we know in the booth.\" Cosell then replied:<ref>{{cite web|title=John Lennon shot 12-8-80 Howard Cosell tells the world twice John Lennon was dead.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n73GFvAyIjs|work=YouTube|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Yes, we have to say it.

Hard to go back to the game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take.}}\n\nLennon had been shot four times and had not been pronounced dead on arrival, but the facts of the shooting were not clear at the time of the announcement. Lennon once appeared on ''Monday Night Football'', during the December 9, 1974 telecast of a 23\u201317 [[1974 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] win over the [[1974 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]], and was interviewed for a short breakaway segment by Cosell.\n\nABC had obtained this scoop as a result of the coincidence of an ABC employee, Alan Weiss, being at the same emergency room that Lennon was brought to that night.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/behind-cosells-announcement-of-lennons-death|title=Behind Cosell's Announcement of Lennon's Death|author=Toni Monkovic |department=The Fifth Down: ''The New York Times'' N.F.L.

He made news and covered topics that were not part of general sports coverage - including the first story about drugs in professional sports (the story of former [[Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota Viking]] [[Carl Eller]]'s [[cocaine]] use), an in-depth look at how NFL owners negotiated tax breaks and incentives for building new stadiums, and together with [[Arthur Ashe]], an investigation into apartheid and sports. Though [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were low, Cosell and his staff earned three [[Emmy Award]]s for excellence in reporting, and broke new ground in sports journalism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosell, Howard - 1993 Hall of Fame Inductee|url=http://www.americansportscastersonline.com/cosell.html|website=American Sportscasters Online|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref>  At the time, ''ABC SportsBeat'' was the first and only regularly scheduled network program devoted solely to sports journalism.\n\nTo produce this pioneering program, Cosell recruited a number of employees from outside the ranks of those that produced games, who he felt might be too invested in the success of the athletes and leagues to look at the hard news. He brought in Michael Marley, then a sportswriter for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Lawrie Mifflin, a writer for ''[[The New York Times]]'', and a 20-year old researcher who quickly rose to an associate producer, Alexis Denny. As a sophomore at [[Yale University]], Ms. Denny had been a student in a seminar that Cosell taught on the \"Business of Big-Time Sports in America\", and was selected by the Director of ''Monday Night Football'' to join their production crew. She took her junior year off to join Cosell's staff at [[American Broadcasting Company#Facilities and studios|ABC Headquarters]] in New York City, and produced many segments, including in 1983 a half-hour special report previewing the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ribowsky|first1=Mark|title=Howard Cosell: The Man, The Myth and the Transformation of American Sports|url=https://archive.org/details/howardcosellmanm00ribo|url-access=registration|date=Nov 14, 2011|publisher=W.W.Horton}}</ref> Despite the games being one of ABC's biggest investments, with a record-breaking 225 million dollar rights fee at the time,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Murray R.|title=American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfTXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA947&lpg=PA947#v=onepage|accessdate=August 6, 2015|isbn=9780313397530}}</ref> the 30 minute documentary-style program produced by Denny showed many sides of the questions about the viability of the games themselves\u2014from concerns about traffic, pollution and terrorism, to a look at how the sponsorship deals were structured.\n\nIn his 1985 autobiography, Cosell reflected on his highly diverse work, and concluded that the ''SportsBeat'' series had been his favorite.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Non-sports-related appearances==\nCosell's colorful personality and distinctive voice were featured to fine comedic effect in several sports-themed episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''.  His feuds with [[New York City]] [[sportswriter]] [[Oscar Madison]] ([[Jack Klugman]]) mirrored the real life feuds he had with some of New York's leading sportswriters.  He also appeared in the [[Woody Allen]] films ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' and ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]''. Such was his celebrity that while he never appeared on the show, Cosell's name was frequently used as an all-purpose answer on the popular 1970s [[game show]] ''[[Match Game]]''. Cosell also had a cameo in the 1988 movie ''[[Johnny Be Good]]'' featuring [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]] and [[Uma Thurman]]. His particular speech pattern was also imitated by one of the characters in the film ''[[Better Off Dead (film)|Better Off Dead]]''.\n\nCosell's national fame was further boosted in Fall 1975 when ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]'' aired on Saturday evenings on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. This was an hour-long [[variety show]], broadcast live from the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in [[New York City]] and hosted by Cosell, which is not to be confused with the NBC series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (which coincidentally also premiered in 1975 under its original title of ''NBC's Saturday Night'', to avoid confusion with Cosell's show). Despite bringing a young comedian, [[Billy Crystal]], to national prominence and for showcasing the American TV debut of the [[Bay City Rollers]] (who later had a hit song by the name of \"[[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|Saturday Night]]\"), Cosell's show was canceled after three months. Cosell later hosted the 1984-1985 [[season finale]] of ''Saturday Night Live''.\n\nCosell was the announcer of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1974 ABC television special ''[[Sinatra \u2013 The Main Event (TV program)|Sinatra \u2013 The Main Event]]''.<ref name=\"Terrace2013\">{{cite book|author=Vincent Terrace|title=Television Specials: 5,336 Entertainment Programs, 1936-2012, 2d ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Of0QAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA157|date=June 19, 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-1240-9|page=157}}</ref>\n\nCosell appeared alongside Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra, Richie Havens, and others on a 1976 spoken word novelty record, ''[[The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay]]''.<ref name=RSJun16>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/remembering-muhammad-alis-trippy-anti-cavity-kids-record-20160606|title=Remembering Muhammad Ali's Trippy, Anti-Cavity Kids' Record|author=Jason Heller|date=June 6, 2016|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1976, Cosell hosted a series of specials known as ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''. The two-hour specials pitted stars from each of the three broadcast networks against each other in various physical and mental competitions. Cosell hosted all but one of the nineteen specials, including the final one airing in 1988.\n\n==Criticism of boxing==\nCosell denounced professional [[boxing]] during the broadcast of a November 26, 1982 WBC heavyweight championship bout between titleholder [[Larry Holmes]] and a clearly outmatched [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] at the [[Astrodome]]. The fight was held two weeks after the fatal fight between [[Ray Mancini]] and [[Duk Koo Kim]], when Kim died shortly after the fight. Cosell famously asked the [[rhetorical question]], \"I wonder if that referee [Steve Crosson] understands that he is constructing an advertisement for the abolition of the very sport that he's a part of?\"<ref name=HolmesCobb>{{cite web|title=Larry Holmes vs Tex Cobb - 4/4|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xswSNKUj6qk#t=403|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>  Cosell, horrified over the brutality of the one-sided fight, said that if the referee did not stop the fight he would never broadcast a professional fight again.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMajor boxing reforms were later implemented, the most important of which allows referees to stop clearly one-sided fights early in order to protect the health of the fighters. In amateur boxing, one-sided fights would be automatically stopped if one fighter had a score considerably higher than his opponent. Hitherto, only the ring physician had the authority to halt a bout. Another change was the reduction of championship bouts from fifteen rounds to twelve rounds by the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]]. (The fatal blows to Kim were in Rounds thirteen and fourteen.) The [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] quickly followed suit, and the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] did so in 1988. Cosell did not cut off ties with the [[United States Amateur Boxing Federation]]. His 1984 broadcasts of the Olympic Trials, box-offs, and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Summer Olympics boxing tournament]], all of which were at the amateur level with much shorter fights, were his last professional calls of the sport.\n\n==''I Never Played the Game'', and reaction==\nAfter Cosell's memoir ''I Never Played the Game'', which, among other things, chronicled his disenchantment with fellow ABC commentators, was published in September 1985, Cosell was taken off scheduled announcing duties for that year's [[1985 World Series|World Series]] and was dismissed by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC television]] shortly thereafter. Cosell's book was seen by many as a bitter \"hate rant\" against those who had offended him. ''[[TV Guide]]'' published excerpts of his memoirs and reported that they had never had as many viewers' responses and they were overwhelmingly negative towards Cosell. The magazine reported some of the \"printable\" ones saying things such as \"[[Will Rogers]] never met Howard Cosell\".\n\nIn ''I Never Played the Game'', Cosell popularized the word \"jockocracy\" (originally coined by author [[Robert Lipsyte]]), describing how athletes were given announcing jobs that they had not earned. Coincidentally, he was replaced for the 1985 World Series broadcast by [[Tim McCarver]], himself a former baseball player, to join [[Al Michaels]] and [[Jim Palmer]]. (The title of the book is a [[double entendre]], meaning that Cosell never actually played the game of football or any other professional sport he broadcast as well as implying that he never played the \"game\" of corporate politics.) Cosell is notably absent from the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/football/nfl/08/02/cosell/index.html |work=Sports Illustrated |first=Marky |last=Billson |title=As strange as it sounds, Howard Cosell has never won Rozelle award |date=August 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>[https://www.sportsbroadcastjournal.com/missing-howard-cosell-has-still-not-won-pro-football-hofs-rozelle-award-for-broadcast-excellence/ Missing: Howard Cosell has still not won Pro Football Hall of Fame's Rozelle Award]</ref>\n\nIn his later years, Cosell briefly hosted his own television [[talk show]], ''Speaking of Everything'', authored his last book (''What's Wrong With Sports''), and continued to appear on radio and television, becoming more outspoken about his criticisms of sports in general.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1993, Cosell was inducted into the [[International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=22291|title=Howard Cosell|work=wwnorton.com}}</ref> A year later, in 1994, he was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]]. He was also the 1995 recipient of the [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]]. After his wife of 46 years, Mary Edith Abrams Cosell (known as \"Emmy\") died from a massive heart attack in 1990, Cosell largely withdrew from the public eye and his health began failing. A longtime smoker, he was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1991, and had surgery to remove a cancerous [[tumor]] in his chest. He also had several minor [[stroke]]s, and was diagnosed with [[Cardiovascular disease|heart]] and [[Nephropathy|kidney disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]].\n\n==Death==\nCosell died at [[Hospital for Joint Diseases]] in Manhattan on April 23, 1995 of a cardiac embolism at the age of 77.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Howard Cosell, Outspoken Sportscaster On Television and Radio, Is Dead at 77 |url=http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/04.25.html|author=[[Robert McG.

In 1944 he married Mary Edith Abrams in a judge's chambers in [[Brooklyn]]. At the war's conclusion in 1945, he was discharged from the United States Army with the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]].\n\n===Early legal career===\nAfter the war, Cosell began practicing law in [[Manhattan]], primarily union law. Some of his clients were actors, and some were athletes, including [[Willie Mays]]. Cosell's own hero in athletics was [[Jackie Robinson]], who served as a personal and professional inspiration to him in his career.\n\n==Career==\n===Introduction to broadcasting===\nCosell represented the [[Little League]] of New York, when in 1953, Hal Neal (president ABC Radio), then an [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] manager, asked him to host a show on New York flagship [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] featuring Little League participants. The show marked the beginning of a relationship with WABC and ABC Radio that would last his entire broadcasting career.\n\nCosell hosted the Little League show for three years without pay, and then decided to leave the law to become a full-time broadcaster. He approached [[Robert Pauley]], President of ABC Radio, with a proposal for a weekly show. Pauley told him the network could not afford to develop untried talent, but he would be put on the air if he would get a sponsor. To Pauley's surprise, Cosell came back with a relative's shirt company as a sponsor, and \"Speaking of Sports\" was born.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/business/media/14pauley.html Robert Pauley, Former Head of ABC Radio, Dies at 85], ''The New York Times'', May 14, 2009.</ref>\n\nCosell took his \"tell it like it is\" approach when he teamed with the ex\u2013[[Brooklyn Dodgers]] pitcher \"Big ''Numba'' Thirteen\" [[Ralph Branca]] on WABC's pre- and post-game [[Radio programming|radio shows]] of the [[New York Mets]] in their nascent years beginning in 1962. He pulled no punches in taking members of the hapless [[expansion team]] to task.\n\nOtherwise on radio, Cosell did his show, ''Speaking of Sports'', as well as sports reports and updates for affiliated [[radio station]]s around the country; he continued his radio duties even after he became prominent on television. Cosell then became a sports anchor at [[WABC-TV]] in New York, where he served in that role from 1961 to 1974. He expanded his commentary beyond sports to a radio show entitled ''Speaking of Everything''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1987/09/02/cosell-gets-back-in-the-picture/61f7b279-6f64-442c-8e73-3af9caccf4e2/|title=COSELL GETS BACK IN THE PICTURE|first=Norman|last=Chad|date=September 2, 1987|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to prominence, supports black athletes===\nCosell rose to prominence in the early-1960s, covering boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], beginning from the time he fought under his [[Name at birth|birth name]], Cassius Clay. The two seemed to have an affinity despite their different personalities, and complemented each other in broadcasts. Cosell was one of the first sportscasters to refer to the boxer as Muhammad Ali after he changed his name, and supported him when he refused to be inducted into the military. Cosell was also an outspoken supporter of Olympic sprinters [[John Carlos]] and [[Tommie Smith]], after they raised their fists in a [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|\"black power\" salute during their 1968 medal ceremony]] in [[Mexico City]]. In a time when many sports broadcasters avoided touching social, racial, or other controversial issues, and kept a certain level of collegiality towards the sports figures they commented on, Cosell did not, and indeed built a reputation around his [[catchphrase]], \"I'm just telling it like it is.\"\n\nCosell's style of reporting transformed [[sports broadcasting]] in the United States. Whereas previous sportscasters had mostly been known for [[color commentary]] and lively [[play-by-play]], Cosell had an intellectual approach. His use of analysis and context brought television sports reporting closer to \"hard\" news reporting. However, his distinctive [[staccato]] voice, [[New York City English|accent]], [[syntax]], and [[cadence (music)|cadence]] were a form of color commentary all their own.\n\nCosell earned his greatest interest from the public when he backed Ali after the boxer's championship title was stripped from him for refusing military service during the [[Vietnam War]]. Cosell found vindication several years later when he was able to inform Ali that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] had unanimously ruled in favor of Ali in ''[[Clay v. United States]]''.\n\nCosell called most of Ali's fights immediately before and after the boxer returned from his three-year exile in October 1970. Those fights were broadcast on taped delay usually a week after they were transmitted on closed circuit. However, Cosell did not call two of Ali's biggest fights, the [[Rumble in the Jungle]] in October 1974 and the first [[Fight of the Century|Ali\u2013Joe Frazier bout]] in March 1971. Promoter [[Jerry Perenchio]] selected actor [[Burt Lancaster]], who had never provided color commentary for a fight, to work the bout with longtime announcer [[Don Dunphy]] and former light-heavyweight champion [[Archie Moore]]. Cosell attended that fight as a spectator only. He would do a [[voice-over]] of that bout, when it was shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] a few days before the second [[Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II|Ali-Frazier bout]] in January 1974.\n\nPerhaps his most famous call took place in the [[George Foreman#The Sunshine Showdown vs. Joe Frazier|fight]] between [[Joe Frazier]] and [[George Foreman]] for the World Heavyweight Championship in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in 1973. When Foreman knocked Frazier to the mat the first of six times, roughly two minutes into the first round, Cosell yelled out:\n\n{{quote|Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier!}}\n\nHis call of Frazier's first trip to the mat became one of the most quoted phrases in American sports broadcasting history. Foreman beat Frazier by a [[Technical knockout|TKO]] in the second round to win the [[World heavyweight boxing championship|World Heavyweight Championship]].\n\nCosell provided blow-by-blow commentary for ABC of some of boxing's biggest matches during the 1970s and the early-1980s, including [[Ken Norton]]'s upset win over Ali in 1973 and Ali's defeat of [[Leon Spinks]] in 1978 recapturing the heavyweight title for the third time. His signature [[toupee]] was unceremoniously knocked off in front of live ABC cameras when a scuffle broke out after a broadcast match between [[Scott LeDoux]] and Johnny Boudreaux. Cosell quickly retrieved his hairpiece and replaced it. During interviews in studio with Ali, the champion would tease and threaten to remove the hairpiece with Cosell playing along but never allowing it to be touched. On one of these occasions, Ali quipped, \"Cosell, you're a phony, and that thing on your head comes from the tail of a pony.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5294873|title=Ali and Cosell, Irresistible Enigmas|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\nWith typical headline generating drama, Cosell abruptly ended his broadcast association with the sport of boxing while providing coverage for ABC for the heavyweight championship bout between [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] on November 26, 1982. Halfway through the bout and with Cobb absorbing a beating, Cosell stopped providing anything more than rudimentary comments about round number and the participants punctuated with occasional declarations of disgust during the 15 rounds. He declared shortly after the fight to a national television audience that he had broadcast his last professional boxing match.\n\nCosell also was an ABC commentator for the television broadcast of the second of the two famous 1973 \"[[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battles of the Sexes]]\" tennis matches, this one between [[Bobby Riggs]] and [[Billie Jean King]].\n\n===Feuds===\nDuring Cosell's tenure as a sportscaster, he frequently clashed with longtime ''[[New York Daily News]]'' sports columnist [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]], who rarely missed an opportunity to denigrate the broadcaster in print as an \"ass\", a \"shill\", or most often, \"Howie the Fraud\". Young would sometimes stand near Cosell and shout profanities so that the audio he was taping for his radio show would be unusable. Writing about Cosell, sportswriter [[Jimmy Cannon]] sniped, \"This is a guy who changed his name, put on a toupee and tried to convince the world that he tells it like it is.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105742,00.html |title=The Mouth That Roared|author=William Plummer|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref> He further added, \"If Howard Cosell were a sport, he'd be [[roller derby]].\"<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1006539/index.htm Nack, William. \"Telling It Like It Is\", ''Sports Illustrated'', May 1, 1995].</ref>\n\nCosell, according to longtime [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[racecaster]] [[Chris Economaki]], \"had an enormous and monumental ego, and may have been the most pompous man I've ever met.\" Cosell ripped Economaki for a miscue in an interview with [[Cale Yarborough]] for ABC \"(and he) never let me forget that\". At an ABC [[Christmas]] party Economaki's wife asked to be introduced to Cosell and Chris said, \"{{'}}Howard, for some inexplicable reason my wife wants to meet you...' and it (ticked) him off to no end. He really took it personally.\"<ref>Economaki, Chris (with Dave Argabright) (2006) ''LET 'EM ALL GO! The Story of Auto Racing by the Man Who Was There'' (Fisher, IN: Books By Dave Argabright), p. 191. {{ISBN|0-9719639-3-2}}.</ref>\n\n===''Monday Night Football''===\nIn [[1970 NFL season|1970]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[executive producer]] for sports [[Roone Arledge]] hired Cosell to be a [[color commentator|commentator]] for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (MNF), the first time in 15 years that [[American football]] was broadcast weekly in [[prime time]]. Cosell was accompanied most of the time by ex-football players [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Don Meredith|\"Dandy\" Don Meredith]].\n\nCosell was openly contemptuous of ex-athletes appointed to prominent sportscasting roles solely on account of their playing fame. He regularly clashed on-air with Meredith, whose laid-back style was in sharp contrast to Cosell's more critical approach to the games.\n\nThe Cosell-Meredith-Gifford dynamic helped make ''Monday Night Football'' a success; it frequently was the number one rated program in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. Cosell's inimitable style distinguished ''Monday Night Football'' from previous sports programming, and ushered in an era of more colorful broadcasters and [[24/7 service|24/7]] TV sports coverage.\n\nIt was during his ''MNF'' run that Cosell coined a phrase that came to be so identified with football that other announcers and spectators\u2014notably [[Chris Berman]]\u2014began to repeat it. An ordinary kickoff return began with Cosell giving commentary about a player's difficult life. It became extraordinary when he suddenly observed, \"He could go all the way!\" As evidenced by the thousands of websites that cite Cosell's quote, many sports commentators consider this to be one of the most famous sports quips of all time.\n\nAlso during his ''MNF'' run, after a 4 September 1978 NFL game, Cosell popularized the term \"[[nachos]]\".<ref>{{cite web | last = Munsey | last2 = Suppes | title = Arlington Stadium | work = Ballparks| url = http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/arling.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===Olympics===\nAlong with ''Monday Night Football'', Cosell worked the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] for [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]]. He played a key role on ABC's coverage of the [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian terror]] group [[Black September (group)|Black September]]'s [[mass murder]] of [[Israel]]i athletes in [[Munich massacre|Munich]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]; providing reports directly from the [[Olympic Park|Olympic Village]] (his image can be seen and voice heard in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Munich (film)|film]] about the terror attack).\n\nIn the [[Boxing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Games in Montreal]], and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 games in Los Angeles]], Cosell was the main voice for boxing. [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] won the gold medal in his light welterweight class at Montreal, beginning his meteoric rise to a world professional title a few years later, and Cosell became close to Leonard, during this period, announcing many of his fights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"I Never Played The Game\", by Howard Cosell, 1985</ref>\n\n===\"The Bronx is burning\"===\nCosell was widely attributed with saying the famous phrase \"the Bronx is burning\". Cosell is credited with saying the quote during Game 2 of the [[1977 World Series]], which took place in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] on October 12, 1977. For a couple of years, fires had routinely erupted in the South [[The Bronx|Bronx]], mostly due to owners of low-value properties burning their own real estate for [[insurance]] money. During the bottom of the first inning, an ABC aerial camera panned a few blocks from Yankee Stadium to a building on fire. The scene became a defining image of New York City in the 1970s. Cosell supposedly stated, \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen, The Bronx is burning.\"<ref name=nypost>{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2010/05/16/why-the-bronx-burned/ | work=New York Post | first=Joe | last=Flood | title=Why the Bronx Burned | date=May 16, 2010}}</ref> This was later picked up by presidential candidate [[Ronald Reagan]], who then made a special trip to the Bronx, to illustrate the failures of politicians to address the issues in that part of New York City.\n\nIn 2005, author Jonathan Mahler published ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning]]'', a book about New York in 1977, and credited Cosell with the title quote during the aerial coverage of the fire. [[ESPN]] produced a 2007 [[Miniseries|mini-series]] based on the book ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]''. Cosell's comment seemed to have captured the widespread view that New York City was in a state of decline.\n\nThe truth was discovered after Major League Baseball published a complete DVD set of all of the games of the 1977 World Series. Coverage of the fire began with [[Keith Jackson]]'s comments regarding the enormity of the blaze, while Cosell added that [[Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter]] had visited that area just days before. At the top of the second inning, the fire was once again shown from a helicopter-mounted camera, and Cosell commented that the [[New York City Fire Department|New York Fire Department]] had a hard job to do in the Bronx as there were always numerous fires. In the bottom of the second, Cosell informed the audience that it was an abandoned building that was burning and no lives were in danger. There was no further comment on the fire, and Cosell appears to have never said \"The Bronx is Burning\" (at least not on camera) during Game 2.<ref name=nypost/>\n\nMahler's confusion could have arisen from a 1974 documentary entitled ''The Bronx Is Burning'': it is likely Mahler confused the documentary with his recollection of Cosell's comments when writing his book.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bestblog.mlblogs.com/archives/2007/08/did_howard_cose_1.html |title=Did Howard Cosell Really Say, \"The Bronx Is Burning\"?|accessdate=2009-12-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213023329/http://bestblog.mlblogs.com/archives/2007/08/did_howard_cose_1.html |archivedate=December 13, 2010  }}</ref>\n\n===Reports the death of John Lennon===\n{{main|Murder of John Lennon}}\nOn the night of December 8, 1980, during a ''Monday Night Football'' game between the [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and the [[1980 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], Cosell shocked the television audience by interrupting his regular commentary duties to deliver a news bulletin on the murder of [[John Lennon]] in the midst of a live broadcast. Word had been passed to Cosell and Frank Gifford by [[Roone Arledge]], who was president of ABC's news and sports divisions at the time, near the end of the game.\n\nCosell was initially apprehensive about announcing Lennon's death. Off the air, Cosell conferred with Gifford and others saying \"Fellas, I just don't know, I'd like your opinion. I can't see this game situation allowing for that news flash, can you?\" Gifford replied, \"Absolutely. I can see it.\" Gifford later told Cosell, \"Don't hang on it. It's a tragic moment and this is going to shake up the whole world.\"\n\nOn air, Gifford prefaced the announcement saying, \"And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, you have got to say what we know in the booth.\" Cosell then replied:<ref>{{cite web|title=John Lennon shot 12-8-80 Howard Cosell tells the world twice John Lennon was dead.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n73GFvAyIjs|work=YouTube|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Yes, we have to say it.

Hard to go back to the game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take.}}\n\nLennon had been shot four times and had not been pronounced dead on arrival, but the facts of the shooting were not clear at the time of the announcement. Lennon once appeared on ''Monday Night Football'', during the December 9, 1974 telecast of a 23\u201317 [[1974 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] win over the [[1974 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]], and was interviewed for a short breakaway segment by Cosell.\n\nABC had obtained this scoop as a result of the coincidence of an ABC employee, Alan Weiss, being at the same emergency room that Lennon was brought to that night.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/behind-cosells-announcement-of-lennons-death|title=Behind Cosell's Announcement of Lennon's Death|author=Toni Monkovic |department=The Fifth Down: ''The New York Times'' N.F.L.

He made news and covered topics that were not part of general sports coverage - including the first story about drugs in professional sports (the story of former [[Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota Viking]] [[Carl Eller]]'s [[cocaine]] use), an in-depth look at how NFL owners negotiated tax breaks and incentives for building new stadiums, and together with [[Arthur Ashe]], an investigation into apartheid and sports. Though [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were low, Cosell and his staff earned three [[Emmy Award]]s for excellence in reporting, and broke new ground in sports journalism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosell, Howard - 1993 Hall of Fame Inductee|url=http://www.americansportscastersonline.com/cosell.html|website=American Sportscasters Online|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref>  At the time, ''ABC SportsBeat'' was the first and only regularly scheduled network program devoted solely to sports journalism.\n\nTo produce this pioneering program, Cosell recruited a number of employees from outside the ranks of those that produced games, who he felt might be too invested in the success of the athletes and leagues to look at the hard news. He brought in Michael Marley, then a sportswriter for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Lawrie Mifflin, a writer for ''[[The New York Times]]'', and a 20-year old researcher who quickly rose to an associate producer, Alexis Denny. As a sophomore at [[Yale University]], Ms. Denny had been a student in a seminar that Cosell taught on the \"Business of Big-Time Sports in America\", and was selected by the Director of ''Monday Night Football'' to join their production crew. She took her junior year off to join Cosell's staff at [[American Broadcasting Company#Facilities and studios|ABC Headquarters]] in New York City, and produced many segments, including in 1983 a half-hour special report previewing the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ribowsky|first1=Mark|title=Howard Cosell: The Man, The Myth and the Transformation of American Sports|url=https://archive.org/details/howardcosellmanm00ribo|url-access=registration|date=Nov 14, 2011|publisher=W.W.Horton}}</ref> Despite the games being one of ABC's biggest investments, with a record-breaking 225 million dollar rights fee at the time,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Murray R.|title=American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfTXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA947&lpg=PA947#v=onepage|accessdate=August 6, 2015|isbn=9780313397530}}</ref> the 30-minute documentary-style program produced by Denny showed many sides of the questions about the viability of the Games themselves - from concerns about traffic, pollution and terrorism, to a look at how the sponsorship deals were structured.\n\nIn his 1985 autobiography, Cosell reflected on his highly diverse work, and concluded that the ''SportsBeat'' series had been his favorite.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Non-sports-related appearances==\nCosell's colorful personality and distinctive voice were featured to fine comedic effect in several sports-themed episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''.  His feuds with [[New York City]] [[sportswriter]] [[Oscar Madison]] ([[Jack Klugman]]) mirrored the real life feuds he had with some of New York's leading sportswriters.  He also appeared in the [[Woody Allen]] films ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' and ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]''. Such was his celebrity that while he never appeared on the show, Cosell's name was frequently used as an all-purpose answer on the popular 1970s [[game show]] ''[[Match Game]]''. Cosell also had a cameo in the 1988 movie ''[[Johnny Be Good]]'' featuring [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]] and [[Uma Thurman]]. His particular speech pattern was also imitated by one of the characters in the film ''[[Better Off Dead (film)|Better Off Dead]]''.\n\nCosell's national fame was further boosted in Fall 1975 when ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]'' aired on Saturday evenings on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. This was an hour-long [[variety show]], broadcast live from the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in [[New York City]] and hosted by Cosell, which is not to be confused with the NBC series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (which coincidentally also premiered in 1975 under its original title of ''NBC's Saturday Night'', to avoid confusion with Cosell's show). Despite bringing a young comedian, [[Billy Crystal]], to national prominence and for showcasing the American TV debut of the [[Bay City Rollers]] (who later had a hit song by the name of \"[[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|Saturday Night]]\"), Cosell's show was canceled after three months. Cosell later hosted the 1984-1985 [[season finale]] of ''Saturday Night Live''.\n\nCosell was the announcer of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1974 ABC television special ''[[Sinatra \u2013 The Main Event (TV program)|Sinatra \u2013 The Main Event]]''.<ref name=\"Terrace2013\">{{cite book|author=Vincent Terrace|title=Television Specials: 5,336 Entertainment Programs, 1936-2012, 2d ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Of0QAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA157|date=June 19, 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-1240-9|page=157}}</ref>\n\nCosell appeared alongside Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra, Richie Havens, and others on a 1976 spoken word novelty record, ''[[The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay]]''.<ref name=RSJun16>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/remembering-muhammad-alis-trippy-anti-cavity-kids-record-20160606|title=Remembering Muhammad Ali's Trippy, Anti-Cavity Kids' Record|author=Jason Heller|date=June 6, 2016|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1976, Cosell hosted a series of specials known as ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''. The two-hour specials pitted stars from each of the three broadcast networks against each other in various physical and mental competitions. Cosell hosted all but one of the nineteen specials, including the final one airing in 1988.\n\n==Criticism of boxing==\nCosell denounced professional [[boxing]] during the broadcast of a November 26, 1982 WBC heavyweight championship bout between titleholder [[Larry Holmes]] and a clearly outmatched [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] at the [[Astrodome]]. The fight was held two weeks after the fatal fight between [[Ray Mancini]] and [[Duk Koo Kim]], when Kim died shortly after the fight. Cosell famously asked the [[rhetorical question]], \"I wonder if that referee [Steve Crosson] understands that he is constructing an advertisement for the abolition of the very sport that he's a part of?\"<ref name=HolmesCobb>{{cite web|title=Larry Holmes vs Tex Cobb - 4/4|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xswSNKUj6qk#t=403|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>  Cosell, horrified over the brutality of the one-sided fight, said that if the referee did not stop the fight he would never broadcast a professional fight again.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMajor boxing reforms were later implemented, the most important of which allows referees to stop clearly one-sided fights early in order to protect the health of the fighters. In amateur boxing, one-sided fights would be automatically stopped if one fighter had a score considerably higher than his opponent. Hitherto, only the ring physician had the authority to halt a bout. Another change was the reduction of championship bouts from fifteen rounds to twelve rounds by the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]]. (The fatal blows to Kim were in Rounds thirteen and fourteen.) The [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] quickly followed suit, and the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] did so in 1988. Cosell did not cut off ties with the [[United States Amateur Boxing Federation]]. His 1984 broadcasts of the Olympic Trials, box-offs, and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Summer Olympics boxing tournament]], all of which were at the amateur level with much shorter fights, were his last professional calls of the sport.\n\n==''I Never Played the Game'', and reaction==\nAfter Cosell's memoir ''I Never Played the Game'', which, among other things, chronicled his disenchantment with fellow ABC commentators, was published in September 1985, Cosell was taken off scheduled announcing duties for that year's [[1985 World Series|World Series]] and was dismissed by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC television]] shortly thereafter. Cosell's book was seen by many as a bitter \"hate rant\" against those who had offended him. ''[[TV Guide]]'' published excerpts of his memoirs and reported that they had never had as many viewers' responses and they were overwhelmingly negative towards Cosell. The magazine reported some of the \"printable\" ones saying things such as \"[[Will Rogers]] never met Howard Cosell\".\n\nIn ''I Never Played the Game'', Cosell popularized the word \"jockocracy\" (originally coined by author [[Robert Lipsyte]]), describing how athletes were given announcing jobs that they had not earned. Coincidentally, he was replaced for the 1985 World Series broadcast by [[Tim McCarver]], himself a former baseball player, to join [[Al Michaels]] and [[Jim Palmer]]. (The title of the book is a [[double entendre]], meaning that Cosell never actually played the game of football or any other professional sport he broadcast as well as implying that he never played the \"game\" of corporate politics.) Cosell is notably absent from the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/football/nfl/08/02/cosell/index.html |work=Sports Illustrated |first=Marky |last=Billson |title=As strange as it sounds, Howard Cosell has never won Rozelle award |date=August 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>[https://www.sportsbroadcastjournal.com/missing-howard-cosell-has-still-not-won-pro-football-hofs-rozelle-award-for-broadcast-excellence/ Missing: Howard Cosell has still not won Pro Football Hall of Fame's Rozelle Award]</ref>\n\nIn his later years, Cosell briefly hosted his own television [[talk show]], ''Speaking of Everything'', authored his last book (''What's Wrong With Sports''), and continued to appear on radio and television, becoming more outspoken about his criticisms of sports in general.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1993, Cosell was inducted into the [[International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=22291|title=Howard Cosell|work=wwnorton.com}}</ref> A year later, in 1994, he was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]]. He was also the 1995 recipient of the [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]]. After his wife of 46 years, Mary Edith Abrams Cosell (known as \"Emmy\") died from a massive heart attack in 1990, Cosell largely withdrew from the public eye and his health began failing. A longtime smoker, he was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1991, and had surgery to remove a cancerous [[tumor]] in his chest. He also had several minor [[stroke]]s, and was diagnosed with [[Cardiovascular disease|heart]] and [[Nephropathy|kidney disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]].\n\n==Death==\nCosell died at [[Hospital for Joint Diseases]] in Manhattan on April 23, 1995 of a cardiac embolism at the age of 77.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Howard Cosell, Outspoken Sportscaster On Television and Radio, Is Dead at 77 |url=http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/04.25.html|author=[[Robert McG.

Originally a PhD thesis, the author adapted it into a book.<ref name=\"Financial-Times\">{{cite news |last1=Ben-Ami |first1=Daniel |title=Free market defined |url=https://www.ft.com/content/519636d2-4298-11e2-a3d2-00144feabdc0 |accessdate=30 July 2019 |publisher=Financial Times |date=13 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Prospect\">{{cite news |last1=Burns |first1=Jennifer |title=The Measure of All Things |url=https://prospect.org/article/measure-all-things |accessdate=3 August 2019 |publisher=The American Prospect |date=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism began after the [[Great Depression]] as a movement of intellectuals committed to protecting [[liberalism|liberal]] values of [[individual liberty]] and [[limited government]], which they believed were threatened in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]] by expanding government. They aimed to construct a distinctly new liberalism (hence \"neoliberalism\") by charting a middle way between the [[laissez-faire]] economics of the pre-[[Great Depression|Depression]] era and the \"[[collectivism]]\" of [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]]. He argues that between the 1950s and 1970s this commitment evolved into one of greater conviction in the superiority of the [[free market]], such that by the 1980s neoliberal policy proposals centered almost entirely around [[market liberalization]]. Modern neoliberalism, according to Jones, is associated with [[economic liberalism]], [[monetarism]], and a staunch support of [[free market]] [[capitalism]], and advocates political policies of [[deregulation]], [[privatization]], and other market-based reforms.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1}}\n\nJones structures the book around what he argues are the three phases of the history of neoliberalism. In the first, lasting from roughly 1920 until 1950, he details how early European neoliberal thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Karl Popper]], motivated by expanding government and later the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during [[World War II]], developed critiques of \"[[collectivism]]\", which to them included British [[social democracy]] and American [[New Deal]] liberalism. Particularly influential during this time was the formation of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], which brought together intellectuals committed to the defense of [[liberalism]] and [[individualism]]. In the second phase, lasting from roughly 1950 until 1980, the locus of neoliberal thought moved to the [[United States]], where academics like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]] built upon the earlier neoliberal foundation by developing new academic and political arguments and introducing a range of neoliberal policy prescriptions. It was during this time that Jones contends neoliberal thought evolved from its more moderate early stance into a \"faith\" in the power and efficiency of markets. Jones argues that during this period a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, and [[think tanks]] arose to promote neoliberal ideology, slowly moving neoliberalism out of the political fringes and into the mainstream. The third phase, taking place after 1980, was the period of neoliberal political prominence. After a decade of [[stagflation]] in the United States and the United Kingdom, the neoliberal alternative to the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated politics was adopted by politicians, finding particular influence with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. This era, Jones notes, was characterized by sweeping [[deregulation]], [[market liberalization]], and [[tax cut|tax reductions]].\n\n==Structure==\nThe book is divided into an introduction, seven chapters, and a conclusion.<ref name =\"Masters\">{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9827.html|title=Masters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics|last=Stedman Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0691151571|ref=harv}}</ref> \n* The introduction summarizes the history of [[neoliberalism]] and lays out the structure of the book. \n* Chapter one (\"The Postwar Settlement\") provides context for the rise of neoliberalism by briefly describing the development of [[embedded liberalism]] and [[Keynesianism]] after the [[Great Depression]]. \n* Chapter two (\"The 1940s: The Emergence of the Neoliberal Critique\") discusses the critiques of [[social democracy]] by the early neoliberals [[Karl Popper]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and outlines the birth of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n* Chapter three (\"The Rising Tide: Neoliberal Ideas in the Postwar Period) discusses the two [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]]s, the relation of [[Adam Smith]] to neoliberalism, the early ideas of [[Milton Friedman]], the [[ordoliberal]]s in [[West Germany]], and the economic theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice]], and [[rational choice theory]]. \n* Chapter four (\"A Transatlantic Nework: Think Tanks and the Ideological Entrepreneurs\") discusses [[fusionism]] in the [[United States]], [[conservatism]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the 1950s, the growth of neoliberal organizations and [[think tanks]] from the 1950s through the 1970s, and the spread of neoliberal thought to journalists and politicians. \n* Chapter five (\"Keynesianism and the Emergence of Monetarism, 1945\u201371) discusses [[Keynesianism]], American economic policy in the 1960s, and the development of [[monetarism]] by Milton Friedman. \n* Chapter six (\"Economic Strategy: The Neoliberal Breakthrough, 1971-84\") discusses the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] and how it set the stage for the political rise of [[monetarism]], which ushered in further neoliberal reforms; it continues with a description of the neoliberal policies of British prime ministers [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], US presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Paul Volcker]]. \n* Chapter seven (\"Neoliberalism Applied? The Transformation of Affordable Housing and Urban Policy in the United States and Britain, 1945\u20132000\") considers the effects of neoliberal policies on housing and [[urban policy]] in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n* The conclusion (\"The Legacy of Transatlantic Neoliberalism: Faith-Based Policy\") discusses the lasting effects of neoliberalism and lays out the author's belief in the need to return \"reason-based policymaking\" to political and economic debates.\n\n==Summary==\n{{Quote box|quote = \"Neoliberalism was a radical form of [[individualism]] that was first generated before World War II in reaction to [[Social liberalism|New Liberalism]], [[Progressivism]], the [[New Deal]], and the onset of [[Nazi]] and [[communist]] [[totalitarianism]].

However, it was during this time that neoliberal thought was refined and spread, creating a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments and [[think tank]]s promoting neoliberal ideas.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} The locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to the United States, with the American intellectuals [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]], as well as the larger [[Chicago school of economics]] they were a part of, becoming increasingly influential.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}} Neoliberal thought evolved: whereas the neoliberalism that had emerged during the [[interwar period|interwar years]] had been a \"nuanced response\" to war, depression and totalitarian regimes, late-twentieth-century neoliberalism became dominated by [[market liberalization]] and [[globalization]], and galvanized around a defense of the superiority of [[free market]]s to government [[Planned economy|economic planning]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nThe third phase, lasting from 1980 onward (the book was released in 2012), is the period of neoliberal political hegemony. Jones suggests that the high [[inflation]] and low [[economic growth]] in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] during the 1970s chipped away at the Keynesian political consensus, which seemed unable to address the decade's [[stagflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|215}} Jones argues that the transatlantic neoliberal network provided a compelling alternative economic ideology\u2014one that conveniently included [[monetarism]], an economic theory dealing with inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|216}} Jones asserts that this led to the widespread political acceptance of neoliberal policies in the 1980s, which brought with it a greater acceptance of neoliberal ideology.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|270}} Jones maintains that, contrary to the opinion of some observers, the adoption of neoliberal policies was not an inevitability; they were not necessarily the \"right\" policies for the challenges of the era, but instead found political power through an \"unpredictable, patchy\" process that had \"luck and historical contingency\" as central players.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|333}} The left-leaning [[Carter administration]] and [[Callaghan government]] were the first to implement particular neoliberal policies,<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|269}} but neoliberalism would find its greatest impact with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who would each successfully advance agendas of [[deregulation]], [[tax cut]]s, and [[market liberalization]]. Jones argues that while these incremental policy changes did not require a wholesale acceptance of neoliberal philosophy, by the late 1980s that is exactly what had happened. Neoliberal ideas on the superiority of the market and [[individual liberty]] became widely accepted by politicians and academics, and Jones contends that this \"boundless belief in markets and deregulation\" ultimately led to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref name=\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\n===First phase: Early history (1920\u20131950)===\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism traces its earliest beginnings to the establishment of the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]] in 1938. The [[Great Depression]] left the reputation of [[economic liberalism]] in tatters, and the scholars at the society sought to \"reconstruct a theory of liberalism\" because they believed that \"[[classical liberalism]] was under assault\". They called this reconstruction \"neoliberalism\" to signify that they were not simply accepting [[laissez-faire]] economics but were developing a new vision of economic liberalism. Ultimately, however, the ideas promoted at the colloquium did not take political hold, and at the outset of [[World War II]] the colloquium was largely forgotten.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe destruction wrought by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes during World War II would, however, energize a number of liberal thinkers in their opposition to [[collectivism]]. From this fear of collectivism emerged the early influential neoliberal texts critiquing [[social democracy]], and led to the formation of a new neoliberal organization by many of the same individuals present at the Colloque Walter Lippman: the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\n====Mont Pelerin Society====\n[[File:Hoff i Mont Pelerin society.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Trygve J.

Friedman himself advocated a level of government intervention in the essay which he would never again publicly support.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|97}}\n\n====Academic thought====\nAccording to Jones: \"After 1945, a distinct neoliberal worldview was built on the foundations of the critique of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] synthesized in the writings of [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[Karl Popper]]...Its main tenets\u2014philosophical, political, and economic\u2014were worked out in detail by scholars such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]], [[Gary Becker]], [[James Buchanan]], and [[Gordon Tullock]], as well as Hayek and Mises.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nJones asserts that the [[Chicago school of economics]], of which Friedman and Stigler were a part, was \"perhaps the most influential group in terms of the development of transatlantic neoliberal politics\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|89}} In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Chicago economists published influential works arguing for [[free market]] policies and extending free market analyses into new regions (e.g. law and regulation). They painted a hostile portrait of [[trade unions]] and presented [[monopoly|monopolies]] as mostly benign.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|92\u201393}}\n\nThe theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice theory]], and [[rational choice theory]] all became influential to neoliberal thought, according to Jones, because they connected the market to politics and the public sector, and helped the neoliberal view of free markets seep into mainstream public and political consciousness.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|126\u2013133}} The economist George Stigler argued that government regulatory bodies often become captured by private industry, so that these bodies act in the interests of private corporations rather than in the public's interest\u2014a notion known as \"regulatory capture\". James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, considered the \"fathers of public choice theory\", emphasized the imperfections of political institutions and constitutional mechanisms, and argued voters have a tendency to vote their own interest rather than in the public interest.\n\n====Milton Friedman and monetarism====\n[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]]]]\n[[Milton Friedman]] became a leading figure of neoliberal thought and a prominent public intellectual in the 1950s. An American, Friedman was less influenced by the effects of [[World War II]] and more by the subsequent [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Jones argues that for neoliberals \"the Cold War necessitated the unambiguous advocacy of the superiority of the market\", and Friedman framed the \"war of ideas\" between [[socialism]] and free-market [[capitalism]] as a \"life-or-death struggle.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101,120}}\n\nJones argues that \"Friedman's significant contribution to neoliberal thought was his connection of [[economic freedom]] with [[political freedom]]\", which he made in his popular book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (which Jones describes as the \"American ''[[Road to Serfdom]]''\").<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|116}} Friedman argued that free markets and liberal democracy are inseparable, that the market guarantees basic political freedoms by ensuring that alternatives are always available (e.g. alternative employment options or alternative goods), guarantees equality by divorcing economic activities from anything unrelated to an individual's [[productivity]], and protects dissent by separating economic power (i.e. the ability to make money) from political power (in other words, politicians cannot deprive an individual of employment if they express political dissent).<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|117,121}} Friedman consistently pointed out his view that \"increases in economic freedom have gone hand in hand with increases in political and civil freedom and have led to increased prosperity; competitive capitalism and freedom have become inseparable\", and pointed to countries like [[China]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Chile]] to justify this.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nJones notes that Friedman was a harsh critic of government intervention in the economy. A key point of ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', according to Jones, was outlining government failure, including in the areas of railroad regulation, [[labor law]], [[monetary policy|monetary]] reform, agriculture, [[public housing]], [[social security]] legislation, [[foreign aid]], [[urban redevelopment]], and [[income tax]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|118}} In ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', Friedman blamed the [[Great Depression]] on overly tight monetary policy by the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|202}} Friedman linked [[New Deal]] liberalism with [[socialism]] and [[communism]], while he considered his own ideas as a part of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] family.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|119}}\n\nFriedman's development of the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory of [[monetarism]] was particularly influential to neoliberalism. Jones argues that the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated political thought in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] for decades had prioritized low [[unemployment]] over [[inflation]]. In contrast, by the 1950s neoliberal thinkers began to emphasize inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|193}} Friedman ultimately developed [[monetarism]], a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory dealing with [[inflation]] and the [[supply of money]] that suggested that the Keynesian view that government can achieve [[full employment]] at the cost of limited inflation was incorrect and would lead to higher inflation in the [[Long run and short run|long run]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Friedman argued that governments and central banks, rather than focusing on employment, should focus on ensuring a constant and predictable level of [[monetary inflation|monetary growth]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Jones describes monetarism as \"the most consistent, systematic, and significant alternative economic strategy to Keynesian demand management and fine-tuning\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|201}} This, according to Jones, primed neoliberal theory for political acceptance in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], who would experience persistent [[stagflation]] during the 1970s. Jones sums it up as such: \"Friedman's monetarist analysis and market solutions grabbed people's attention as a ready-made and plausible alternative strategy [to Keynesianism] when the economy began to unravel [in the 1970s] under the weight of stagflation\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n====Think tanks====\nIn Britain and the United States, the neoliberal right built a \"dazzling array of think tanks\", which became the preferred vehicle of neoliberal thinkers.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|336}} Notable among these, according to Jones, were the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Cato Institute]], the [[Adam Smith Institute]], and a group of think tanks emanating out of the [[Atlas Network|Atlas Foundation]], including the [[Fraser Institute]], the Fisher Institute, and the [[Manhattan Institute]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} These think tanks brought politicians and businesspeople into contact with neoliberal ideas and thinkers and raised the public profile of free-market policies. In particular, the Heritage Foundation had a significant influence on US president [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2014claiming on its website that nearly two-thirds of the proposals they suggested to him in their policy guide ''[[Mandate for Leadership]]'' were implemented<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blasko |first1=Andrew |title=REAGAN AND HERITAGE: A Unique Partnership |url=https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership |website=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\u2014while the Adam Smith Institute had appreciable sway with the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]]. Jones notes that many of these institutes were funded by wealthy businessmen, such as [[Charles Koch]] and [[Joseph Coors]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n====Relation to conservatism====\nFree market economics has been associated with the [[political right]], but Jones emphasizes that it is \"but one branch\" of it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|138}} In the United States, he argues that the right had a number of often-competing interests (principally [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], [[anticommunism]], and [[neoliberalism]]), but the \"distinctive feature of the conservative revival in the 1950s and 1960s was the ability of its disparate elements to unite under the banners of [[anticommunism]] and [[states' rights]]\"\u2014a union that became known as \"[[fusionism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|140}} This union, which Jones largely credits [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] for achieving, led to the growth of a conservative establishment that would, after decades of decline, rival its liberal opponents.

The collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] in 1971 indicated the end of the experiment with [[fixed exchange rates]]. The assumption that there was a relatively simple and manipulable trade-off between [[inflation]] and [[employment]], the famous [[Phillips Curve]]...proved to be a dangerous illusion...In both Britain and the United States, the appearance of [[stagflation]]...meant that governments felt forced to change course.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1\u20132}}|align = right |width = 20%}}\nJones notes that there were two major issues facing the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the 1960s: the instability of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] and high [[inflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|219\u2013220}} As Jones describes it: \"the late 1960s and early 1970s brought a succession of economic shocks that undermined the postwar international monetary system and pushed the world economy into stormy waters. The final stage in the shift in economic strategy in Britain and the United States, the reason neoliberal ideas found a receptive audience, was the force of these events.\" The proposed neoliberal solutions of [[monetarism]], [[deregulation]], and [[trade union]] reform, as well as the wealth of neoliberal arguments against the prevailing Keynesian demand management, provided a \"powerfully compelling logic\", and neoliberal policies were soon adopted by British and American politicians.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|15}} Yet these economic solutions acted as mere \"Trojan horses for a more polemical neoliberal faith in free markets\", which would come to dominate politics in the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|13}}\n[[Image:US Historical Inflation.svg|thumb|Rate of inflation in the United States (1914-2009)|left]]\n\nNeoliberal policies, according to Jones, were first introduced in the United States by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] president [[Jimmy Carter]] and in the United Kingdom by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] prime minister [[James Callaghan]].

They aimed to construct a distinctly new liberalism (hence \"neoliberalism\") by charting a middle way between the [[laissez-faire]] economics of the pre-[[Great Depression|Depression]] era and the \"[[collectivism]]\" of [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]]. He argues that between the 1950s and 1970s this commitment evolved into one of greater conviction in the superiority of the [[free market]], such that by the 1980s neoliberal policy proposals centered almost entirely around [[market liberalization]]. Modern neoliberalism, according to Jones, is associated with [[economic liberalism]], [[monetarism]], and a staunch support of [[free market]] [[capitalism]], and advocates political policies of [[deregulation]], [[privatization]], and other market-based reforms.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1}}\n\nJones structures the book around what he argues are the three phases of the history of neoliberalism. In the first, lasting from roughly 1920 until 1950, he details how early European neoliberal thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Karl Popper]], motivated by expanding government and later the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during [[World War II]], developed critiques of \"[[collectivism]]\", which to them included British [[social democracy]] and American [[New Deal]] liberalism. Particularly influential during this time was the formation of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], which brought together intellectuals committed to the defense of [[liberalism]] and [[individualism]]. In the second phase, lasting from roughly 1950 until 1980, the locus of neoliberal thought moved to the [[United States]], where academics like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]] built upon the earlier neoliberal foundation by developing new academic and political arguments and introducing a range of neoliberal policy prescriptions. It was during this time that Jones contends neoliberal thought evolved from its more moderate early stance into a \"faith\" in the power and efficiency of markets. Jones argues that during this period a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, and [[think tanks]] arose to promote neoliberal ideology, slowly moving neoliberalism out of the political fringes and into the mainstream. The third phase, taking place after 1980, was the period of neoliberal political prominence. After a decade of [[stagflation]] in the United States and the United Kingdom, the neoliberal alternative to the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated politics was adopted by politicians, finding particular influence with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. This era, Jones notes, was characterized by sweeping [[deregulation]], [[market liberalization]], and [[tax cut|tax reductions]].\n\n==Structure==\nThe book is divided into an introduction, seven chapters, and a conclusion.<ref name =\"Masters\">{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9827.html|title=Masters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics|last=Stedman Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0691151571|ref=harv}}</ref> \n* The introduction summarizes the history of [[neoliberalism]] and lays out the structure of the book. \n* Chapter one (\"The Postwar Settlement\") provides context for the rise of neoliberalism by briefly describing the development of [[embedded liberalism]] and [[Keynesianism]] after the [[Great Depression]]. \n* Chapter two (\"The 1940s: The Emergence of the Neoliberal Critique\") discusses the critiques of [[social democracy]] by the early neoliberals [[Karl Popper]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and outlines the birth of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n* Chapter three (\"The Rising Tide: Neoliberal Ideas in the Postwar Period) discusses the two [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]]s, the relation of [[Adam Smith]] to neoliberalism, the early ideas of [[Milton Friedman]], the [[ordoliberal]]s in [[West Germany]], and the economic theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice]], and [[rational choice theory]]. \n* Chapter four (\"A Transatlantic Nework: Think Tanks and the Ideological Entrepreneurs\") discusses [[fusionism]] in the [[United States]], [[conservatism]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the 1950s, the growth of neoliberal organizations and [[think tanks]] from the 1950s through the 1970s, and the spread of neoliberal thought to journalists and politicians. \n* Chapter five (\"Keynesianism and the Emergence of Monetarism, 1945\u201371) discusses [[Keynesianism]], American economic policy in the 1960s, and the development of [[monetarism]] by Milton Friedman. \n* Chapter six (\"Economic Strategy: The Neoliberal Breakthrough, 1971-84\") discusses the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] and how it set the stage for the political rise of [[monetarism]], which ushered in further neoliberal reforms; it continues with a description of the neoliberal policies of British prime ministers [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], US presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Paul Volcker]]. \n* Chapter seven (\"Neoliberalism Applied?

However, it was during this time that neoliberal thought was refined and spread, creating a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments and [[think tank]]s promoting neoliberal ideas.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} The locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to the United States, with the American intellectuals [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]], as well as the larger [[Chicago school of economics]] they were a part of, becoming increasingly influential.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}} Neoliberal thought evolved: whereas the neoliberalism that had emerged during the [[interwar period|interwar years]] had been a \"nuanced response\" to war, depression and totalitarian regimes, late-twentieth-century neoliberalism became dominated by [[market liberalization]] and [[globalization]], and galvanized around a defense of the superiority of [[free market]]s to government [[Planned economy|economic planning]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nThe third phase, lasting from 1980 onward (the book was released in 2012), is the period of neoliberal political hegemony.

Jones argues that while these incremental policy changes did not require a wholesale acceptance of neoliberal philosophy, by the late 1980s that is exactly what had happened. Neoliberal ideas on the superiority of the market and [[individual liberty]] became widely accepted by politicians and academics, and Jones contends that this \"boundless belief in markets and deregulation\" ultimately led to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref name=\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\n===First phase: Early history (1920\u20131950)===\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism traces its earliest beginnings to the establishment of the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]] in 1938. The [[Great Depression]] left the reputation of [[economic liberalism]] in tatters, and the scholars at the society sought to \"reconstruct a theory of liberalism\" because they believed that \"[[classical liberalism]] was under assault\". They called this reconstruction \"neoliberalism\" to signify that they were not simply accepting [[laissez-faire]] economics but were developing a new vision of economic liberalism. Ultimately, however, the ideas promoted at the colloquium did not take political hold, and at the outset of [[World War II]] the colloquium was largely forgotten.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe destruction wrought by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes during World War II would, however, energize a number of liberal thinkers in their opposition to [[collectivism]]. From this fear of collectivism emerged the early influential neoliberal texts critiquing [[social democracy]], and led to the formation of a new neoliberal organization by many of the same individuals present at the Colloque Walter Lippman: the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\n====Mont Pelerin Society====\n[[File:Hoff i Mont Pelerin society.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Trygve J.

Friedman himself advocated a level of government intervention in the essay which he would never again publicly support.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|97}}\n\n====Academic thought====\nAccording to Jones: \"After 1945, a distinct neoliberal worldview was built on the foundations of the critique of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] synthesized in the writings of [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[Karl Popper]]...Its main tenets\u2014philosophical, political, and economic\u2014were worked out in detail by scholars such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]], [[Gary Becker]], [[James Buchanan]], and [[Gordon Tullock]], as well as Hayek and Mises.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nJones asserts that the [[Chicago school of economics]], of which Friedman and Stigler were a part, was \"perhaps the most influential group in terms of the development of transatlantic neoliberal politics\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|89}} In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Chicago economists published influential works arguing for [[free market]] policies and extending free market analyses into new regions (e.g. law and regulation). They painted a hostile portrait of [[trade unions]] and presented [[monopoly|monopolies]] as mostly benign.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|92\u201393}}\n\nThe theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice theory]], and [[rational choice theory]] all became influential to neoliberal thought, according to Jones, because they connected the market to politics and the public sector, and helped the neoliberal view of free markets seep into mainstream public and political consciousness.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|126\u2013133}} The economist George Stigler argued that government regulatory bodies often become captured by private industry, so that these bodies act in the interests of private corporations rather than in the public's interest\u2014a notion known as \"regulatory capture\". James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, considered the \"fathers of public choice theory\", emphasized the imperfections of political institutions and constitutional mechanisms, and argued voters have a tendency to vote their own interest rather than in the public interest.\n\n====Milton Friedman and monetarism====\n[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]]]]\n[[Milton Friedman]] became a leading figure of neoliberal thought and a prominent public intellectual in the 1950s. An American, Friedman was less influenced by the effects of [[World War II]] and more by the subsequent [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Jones argues that for neoliberals \"the Cold War necessitated the unambiguous advocacy of the superiority of the market\", and Friedman framed the \"war of ideas\" between [[socialism]] and free-market [[capitalism]] as a \"life-or-death struggle.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101,120}}\n\nJones argues that \"Friedman's significant contribution to neoliberal thought was his connection of [[economic freedom]] with [[political freedom]]\", which he made in his popular book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (which Jones describes as the \"American ''[[Road to Serfdom]]''\").<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|116}} Friedman argued that free markets and liberal democracy are inseparable, that the market guarantees basic political freedoms by ensuring that alternatives are always available (e.g. alternative employment options or alternative goods), guarantees equality by divorcing economic activities from anything unrelated to an individual's [[productivity]], and protects dissent by separating economic power (i.e. the ability to make money) from political power (in other words, politicians cannot deprive an individual of employment if they express political dissent).<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|117,121}} Friedman consistently pointed out his view that \"increases in economic freedom have gone hand in hand with increases in political and civil freedom and have led to increased prosperity; competitive capitalism and freedom have become inseparable\", and pointed to countries like [[China]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Chile]] to justify this.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nJones notes that Friedman was a harsh critic of government intervention in the economy. A key point of ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', according to Jones, was outlining government failure, including in the areas of railroad regulation, [[labor law]], [[monetary policy|monetary]] reform, agriculture, [[public housing]], [[social security]] legislation, [[foreign aid]], [[urban redevelopment]], and [[income tax]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|118}} In ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', Friedman blamed the [[Great Depression]] on overly tight monetary policy by the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|202}} Friedman linked [[New Deal]] liberalism with [[socialism]] and [[communism]], while he considered his own ideas as a part of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] family.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|119}}\n\nFriedman's development of the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory of [[monetarism]] was particularly influential to neoliberalism. Jones argues that the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated political thought in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] for decades had prioritized low [[unemployment]] over [[inflation]]. In contrast, by the 1950s neoliberal thinkers began to emphasize inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|193}} Friedman ultimately developed [[monetarism]], a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory dealing with [[inflation]] and the [[supply of money]] that suggested that the Keynesian view that government can achieve [[full employment]] at the cost of limited inflation was incorrect and would lead to higher inflation in the [[Long run and short run|long run]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Friedman argued that governments and central banks, rather than focusing on employment, should focus on ensuring a constant and predictable level of [[monetary inflation|monetary growth]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Jones describes monetarism as \"the most consistent, systematic, and significant alternative economic strategy to Keynesian demand management and fine-tuning\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|201}} This, according to Jones, primed neoliberal theory for political acceptance in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], who would experience persistent [[stagflation]] during the 1970s. Jones sums it up as such: \"Friedman's monetarist analysis and market solutions grabbed people's attention as a ready-made and plausible alternative strategy [to Keynesianism] when the economy began to unravel [in the 1970s] under the weight of stagflation\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n====Think tanks====\nIn Britain and the United States, the neoliberal right built a \"dazzling array of think tanks\", which became the preferred vehicle of neoliberal thinkers.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|336}} Notable among these, according to Jones, were the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Cato Institute]], the [[Adam Smith Institute]], and a group of think tanks emanating out of the [[Atlas Network|Atlas Foundation]], including the [[Fraser Institute]], the Fisher Institute, and the [[Manhattan Institute]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} These think tanks brought politicians and businesspeople into contact with neoliberal ideas and thinkers and raised the public profile of free-market policies. In particular, the Heritage Foundation had a significant influence on US president [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2014claiming on its website that nearly two-thirds of the proposals they suggested to him in their policy guide ''[[Mandate for Leadership]]'' were implemented<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blasko |first1=Andrew |title=REAGAN AND HERITAGE: A Unique Partnership |url=https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership |website=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\u2014while the Adam Smith Institute had appreciable sway with the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]]. Jones notes that many of these institutes were funded by wealthy businessmen, such as [[Charles Koch]] and [[Joseph Coors]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n====Relation to conservatism====\nFree market economics has been associated with the [[political right]], but Jones emphasizes that it is \"but one branch\" of it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|138}} In the United States, he argues that the right had a number of often-competing interests (principally [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], [[anticommunism]], and [[neoliberalism]]), but the \"distinctive feature of the conservative revival in the 1950s and 1960s was the ability of its disparate elements to unite under the banners of [[anticommunism]] and [[states' rights]]\"\u2014a union that became known as \"[[fusionism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|140}} This union, which Jones largely credits [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] for achieving, led to the growth of a conservative establishment that would, after decades of decline, rival its liberal opponents. This \"pave[d] the way for the later electoral successes of Ronald Reagan\", which would usher in neoliberal policies.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|146}}\n\n===Third phase: Policy implementation (1980 onward)===\n{{Quote box|quote = \"The demise of the postwar economic settlement had been hastened by a series of catastrophic events: the [[Vietnam War]], the first [[1973 oil crisis|oil shock of 1973]], and the near collapse of [[industrial relations]] in Britain.

The collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] in 1971 indicated the end of the experiment with [[fixed exchange rates]]. The assumption that there was a relatively simple and manipulable trade-off between [[inflation]] and [[employment]], the famous [[Phillips Curve]]...proved to be a dangerous illusion...In both Britain and the United States, the appearance of [[stagflation]]...meant that governments felt forced to change course.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1\u20132}}|align = right |width = 20%}}\nJones notes that there were two major issues facing the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the 1960s: the instability of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] and high [[inflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|219\u2013220}} As Jones describes it: \"the late 1960s and early 1970s brought a succession of economic shocks that undermined the postwar international monetary system and pushed the world economy into stormy waters. The final stage in the shift in economic strategy in Britain and the United States, the reason neoliberal ideas found a receptive audience, was the force of these events.\" The proposed neoliberal solutions of [[monetarism]], [[deregulation]], and [[trade union]] reform, as well as the wealth of neoliberal arguments against the prevailing Keynesian demand management, provided a \"powerfully compelling logic\", and neoliberal policies were soon adopted by British and American politicians.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|15}} Yet these economic solutions acted as mere \"Trojan horses for a more polemical neoliberal faith in free markets\", which would come to dominate politics in the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|13}}\n[[Image:US Historical Inflation.svg|thumb|Rate of inflation in the United States (1914-2009)|left]]\n\nNeoliberal policies, according to Jones, were first introduced in the United States by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] president [[Jimmy Carter]] and in the United Kingdom by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] prime minister [[James Callaghan]].

After identifying the pilot as a Number Eight, ''Galactica'' allows the Raptor to land. To the shock of everyone, [[Ellen Tigh]] is onboard, having been [[Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)|believed dead]] for eighteen months. [[Galen Tyrol|Tyrol]] warmly greets the Eight pilot before identifying her as Boomer to Admiral Adama. Upon learning that Boomer is the pilot, Adama has her locked in the ship's brig.\n\nEllen and [[Saul Tigh|Saul]] reunite and, after making love, go together to visit [[Sam Anders]], who is still comatose. Tory Foster, [[Galen Tyrol]], a [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Six]] and an Eight are also by Anders' bedside. The Cylons propose that since Ellen has returned, they should leave the human fleet, especially since Caprica Six is pregnant with Saul's fully-Cylon child and they no longer need humans in order to reproduce. Ellen did not know about Caprica Six being pregnant, and is angry at Saul as she was never able to conceive children, and Caprica could only have become pregnant if he truly loved her. Furthermore, because the other Cylons are the Final Five's creations, she views Saul's relationship with Caprica in an incestuous light.\n\nA vote is had by the Final Five on whether they should stay with the human fleet, and they promise to be bound by the results of that vote. Tory Foster and Galen Tyrol vote they go, Saul Tigh votes they stay and they assume from what Anders has said previously he would also vote to stay, which leaves Ellen with the deciding vote. She states that she needs more time, and goes to visit Caprica Six in her quarters. She \"accidentally\" tells Caprica Six that she and Saul had sex, before telling her she believed Saul loved Caprica more than he loved her. Ellen then calls another meeting, and says she has decided that the Cylon fleet should leave. Saul refuses to leave, and Ellen says this is because he loves the ship and [[William Adama]] more than herself or Caprica Six. Caprica becomes upset and starts to lose the baby. He and Ellen unite to try to tell Caprica that Saul does love her which Ellen believes will save the baby, but Caprica Six still suffers a [[miscarriage]]. Saul goes to Adama for support, revealing that the baby's name was \"Liam\", short for William. (Writer Jane Espenson confirmed that Saul wanted to name his child after his best friend.<ref name=\"mr\"/>)\n\nElsewhere, Tyrol and teams of Cylons attempt to fix the ship by using a Cylon polymer to grow into the cracks. [[Gaius Baltar]] rejoins his believers, who have taken up arms in order to get and keep supplies, but gives some away to starving people in \"Dogsville\" before the rest is stolen by the Sons of Ares. He appeals to Admiral Adama, who supplies him with weapons to prevent it happening in the future.  Near the end of the episode, the monitor near Anders indicates that he has higher brain functions and his eyes flutter as in [[REM sleep]]. The episode ends with Roslin and Adama walking through the ship past a Six and an Eight working on the ship's hull and a group of mixed human and Cylon pilots. A Six has stopped in front of the Wall, staring at the photos, and Roslin realises that the Cylons have begun memorialising their dead there in the same way as the humans.\n\n==Cut scenes==\nSome material expanding on the situation in Dogsville was cut as the episode was originally eleven minutes too long for broadcast. In the cut scenes, it is explained that due to three years of war and a mutiny, there are no longer enough marines to maintain order in the fleet and they have been forced to retreat from Dogsville. The Sons of Ares take control of the food supply, except for the stash held by Baltar's cult. Lee Adama and Roslin discuss the possibility of bringing in [[Cylon (reimagining)#Centurions|Centurions]] to provide more security in civilian areas, however, Admiral Adama is firmly opposed. Thus, when Baltar approaches him for better weapons, Adama is faced with two options: \n<blockquote>\nEffectively, the question for Adama is, allow a criminal gang to control the food supply, or allow Baltar's crazy cultists to control it. And Baltar's group, now armed to the teeth, would also serve as a civilian security force, which Adama figures is better than using centurions.

The remainder of Company L and Company K were sent in to help the fire teams break contact and were drawn into a daylong battle. By the end of the day the Marines had lost 6 killed, 36 wounded and 1 missing.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|50\u20131}}\n\nOn 11 January a 3-Company operation was mounted to recover the body of the Marine missing in the 7 January operation, the PAVN had dragged the body into the DMZ and were using it as bait to trap US forces. The Marines supported by artillery and air strikes outflanked the PAVN positions, destroyed 25 bunkers and killed 15 PAVN for the loss of 2 Marines wounded.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|51\u20132}}\n\nOn 18 January Company L 3/4 Marines launched a patrol 3.2&nbsp;km northeast of Con Thien into an area nicknamed the ''Meat Market'' by Marines. The patrol was ambushed by PAVN in well-camouflaged bunkers and the lead squad was cut off from the rest of the Company and was used by the PAVN as bait for the other Marines. Under the cover of Marine gunships and artillery fire, the survivors and dead of the isolated squad were brought back into the Company perimeter. Company M then moved forward to relieve Company L and the combined force overran several PAVN bunkers. Marine losses were 9 dead and 22 wounded, while the PAVN were estimated to have suffered 100 casualties.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|56\u20137}}\n\nDue to the uncertainty of PAVN intentions in the DMZ, on 20 January [[COMUSMACV]], [[William Westmoreland|General Westmoreland]] agreed to a request from [[III Marine Expeditionary Force#Vietnam War|III Marine Amphibious Force]] (III MAF) to suspend construction on the strongpoint obstacle system.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|126}}\n\n==February 1968==\n[[File:A190484.tif|thumb|right|Crewman of 3rd Tank Battalion keeps watch for PAVN snipers east of Con Thien]]\nAt 02:15 on 2 February the PAVN attacked the [[Combined Action Program|Combined Action Company P]] headquarters at [[Cam L\u1ed9]]. The Marines, supported by a detachment of US Army [[M42 Duster]]s held off the PAVN attack until relieved by a quick reaction force from 2/9 Marines.

The remainder of Company K moved to reinforce the ambushed platoon and were themselves ambushed from well-concealed PAVN bunkers, suffering 18 killed and 10 wounded in the first 5 minutes, including the Platoon commanders and their radio operators. At the 3/3 Marines operations center at Strongpoint A-3 the Battalion Commander ordered Company L to establish blocking positions while Company M manoevured to relieve Company K. Company M was unable to reach the ambush site before dark and Company L returned to Strongpoint A-3, while Companies K and M dug in for the night. On the morning of 8 February the two Companies, supported by tanks, artillery and gunships, attacked the PAVN bunker complex, killing 139 PAVN, while suffering a further 3 Marines killed.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|139\u2013140}}\n\nFollowing their defeat in the [[Tet Offensive]] there was a marked decline in PAVN activity along the DMZ apart from ongoing artillery, rocket and mortar fire.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|228}}\n\n==March 1968==\nThe PAVN continued to pressure the Marines particularly around the A-3 strongpoint between Con Thien and Gio Linh. On 3 March Company L, [[3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines#Vietnam War|3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines]], occupying an outpost on Hill 28 just north of the A-3, intercepted a PAVN battalion attempting to infiltrate the Marine positions. The PAVN encircled the Marines and were only driven back by airstrikes and Huey gunship runs. One Marine was killed and thirteen wounded while killing over 100 PAVN.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|244}}\n\nOn 16 March, Company M, 3/3 Marines and Company C, 1/4 Marines clashed with another battalion-sized PAVN force. The two Marine companies called in artillery and air upon the PAVN, the bulk of which disengaged, leaving a company behind to fight a rearguard action. PAVN artillery from north of the DMZ answered the American supporting arms with a 400-round barrage of its own on the Marines. Marine casualties were two killed and nine wounded for 83 NVA killed. For the entire month in Operation Kentucky, 9th Marines reported over 400 enemy dead while Marine casualties were 37 killed and more than 200 wounded.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|244}}\n\n==April\u2013May 1968==\n[[File:A191498.tif|thumb|right|9th Marines supported by a tank engage a PAVN position north of Dong Ha]]\nOn 22 May a patrol from Company A 1/4 Marines ran into a PAVN force east of Con Thien. 1/4 attacked east from Con Thien, while 3/3 Marines attacked west from Strongpoint A-3. 3/9 Marines were helicoptered into blocking positions in the south, while 1/9 Marines was helicoptered into blocking positions in the north. The PAVN tried to escape across the trace line but were mowed down by artillery, tank, gunship and fixed-wing fire.

Reinforced by the command group and a rifle platoon from Company H, the patrol engaged the PAVN with small arms and 81mm mortars. 14 PAVN were killed and the Marines suffered 14 killed and 11 wounded.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|357}}\n\nOn 7 July, to exploit the results of [[Operation Thor]] in the [[C\u1eeda Vi\u1ec7t Base|C\u1eeda Vi\u1ec7t]]-Dong Ha sector, the 9th Marines began a sweep of the area between Con Thien and the DMZ. On 11 July, 4&nbsp;km northeast of Con Thien, elements of 3/9 Marines discovered a reinforced PAVN platoon in the open. Fixing the PAVN in place with small arms fire, the Marines, with air, artillery, and tank support, launched a coordinated air-ground attack through the area killing more than 30 PAVN. The 9th Marines uncovered and destroyed numerous PAVN fortifications, a few of the positions were lightly defended, but the majority were abandoned. One bunker system discovered 4&nbsp;km meters due north of Con Thien spanned more than 1&nbsp;km and included 242 well-constructed bunkers. Supplies and equipment abandoned included weapons, 935 mortar rounds, 500 pounds of explosives, 55 antitank mines, and 500 pounds of rice. The Marines also found 29 bodies, killed by artillery and airstrikes during the advance on the complex.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|363}}\n\nOn 21 July 2/9 Marines discovered a major PAVN bunker complex 6&nbsp;km southwest of Con Thien. Composed of 60 A-frame timbered bunkers built into the sides of bomb craters, each with an average overhead cover 10-feet-thick, the system was connected to a large command bunker by a network of interconnecting tunnels. The command bunker featured an aperture overlooking Con Thien and [[Charlie 2|C-2]] and documents found in the bunker indicated that the PAVN had been observing and reporting the movement of helicopters, tanks, and trucks entering and leaving Con Thien and C-2.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|365}}\n\n==August 1968==\nEarly August saw little contact with the PAVN other than an encounter by Company F, 9th Marines with 30 PAVN, 3&nbsp;km east of Con Thien. In the face of artillery and fixed-wing support, the PAVN broke contact and the Marines began a sweep through the area during which they regained contact. The PAVN again broke and ran, and Company F moved through the area, capturing a number of weapons and counting 11 dead.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|387}}\n\nOn 15 August, a PAVN company attacked a four-man Marine reconnaissance team southeast of Con Thien near the abandoned airstrip at [[Nam \u0110\u00f4ng District|Nam \u0110\u00f4ng]]. The patrol returned fire and requested reinforcement, while simultaneously calling in preplanned artillery fires. Within minutes a platoon from Company A, 1st Marines, accompanied by three tanks, moved out of positions 1&nbsp;km away and headed south to assist. The coordinated attack, which included more than 150 rounds of 105mm artillery, 40 rounds of 4.2-inch mortar, 75 rounds from the 90mm guns of the tanks, and airstrikes by Marine UH-1E gunships accounted for several PAVN dead.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|389}}\n\nAs PAVN activity continued to increase in the eastern DMZ, particularly north of Con Thien, the Marines decided to act. In addition to sightings of enemy tanks, Marine fighter pilots and aerial observers reported spotting trucks, truck parks, camouflaged revetments, storage bunkers, and trenchlines. Of special interest were repeated sightings of low, slow moving lights during hours of darkness which, it was assumed, came from enemy helicopters thought to be resupplying forward positions with high priority cargo such as ammunition and medical supplies or conducting medevacs. On 19 August, after 60 [[Operation Arc Light|Arclight]] strikes [[2nd Battalion, 1st Marines#Vietnam War|2nd Battalion, 1st Marines]] assaulted into three landing zones in the Trung Son region of the southern DMZ, 5&nbsp;km north of Con Thien. Supported by a platoon of tanks from [[3rd Tank Battalion#Vietnam War|3rd Tank Battalion]], 2/1 Marines swept the area but found no evidence of use by [[VPAF]] helicopters. During the extraction one [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46 Sea Knight]] was destroyed by a command detonated mine, killing 4 Marines.\n\nWhile the assault claimed no PAVN casualties, it did scatter PAVN forces in the area. On the morning of the 19th, Bravo Company, 2/1 and the Army's Company A, [[77th Armor Regiment (United States)|77th Armored Regiment]] engaged an enemy platoon while supported by M-48s from 3rd Tank Battalion, killing 26 PAVN. 6&nbsp;km southwest of Con Thien  Mike Company, 3/9 Marines intercepted a reinforced PAVN platoon, under the cover of airstrikes and artillery they kill 30 NVA and captured 2. On 20 August, 2 PAVN squads attacked Companies G and H, 2/9 Marines with small arms, RPGs, mortars, and artillery. The Marines, supported by 5 M-48s from 3rd Tank Battalion forced the PAVN to withdraw northward, leaving their dead. On 21 August, Company I, 9th Marines began receiving sniper fire and within an hour, the company had engaged a PAVN unit of undetermined size, firing small arms and grenades, responding with accurate rocket, mortar, and artillery fire, the Marines forced the PAVN to break contact and withdraw to the north. A search of the area found 14 PAVN dead and 12 weapons.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|389}}\n\nOn 24 August at 17:00, Marine reconnaissance team ''Tender Rancho'' was moving 7&nbsp;km southeast of Con Thien near Dao Xuyen, when it surprised a group of 15 bivouacked PAVN troops killing 6. Within minutes the team received a barrage of 82mm mortars and immediately formed a 360-degree security. 90 minutes later gunships arrived on station and informed the team that the PAVN surrounded them. At 19:30 despite receiving 0.50 caliber and 82mm mortar fire helicopters inserted a reinforced platoon from Company D, 1st Marines to assist. Meanwhile, additional platoons from Company D, along with Company C, moving overland from the east took up blocking positions north of the encircled reconnaissance team before dark. At daylight on 25 August, Marine helicopters inserted the remainder of Company D. During the insertion a [[Sikorsky H-34#Vietnam War|CH-34]], while dodging enemy fire, struck a tree breaking off the tail section, killing 3 and wounding 14. With the arrival of elements of 1/3 Marines and Company M, 3/9 Marines later in the day, the Marines effectively cordoned the area, preventing a PAVN withdrawal. During the remainder of the 25th and into the 26th, as Companies C and D, 1st Marines pushed southward toward the other blocking forces, the PAVN made several unsuccessful attempts to break the cordon. By the end of 26 August, after three days of fighting, the PAVN had suffered 78 killed while the Marines suffered 11 killed and 58 wounded.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|389\u2013390}}\n\nOn 31 August 1st Marines was relieved of responsibility for the Kentucky area of operations by the Army's 1st Brigade, [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division (Mechanized)]].<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|390}}\n\n==September 1968==\nOn 4 September, a platoon from Company A, [[61st Infantry Regiment (United States)|61st Infantry]] was sent to the relief of Company M, 3/9 Marines which was engaged in battle with a reinforced PAVN company in bunkers west of Con Thien. Joined by a reaction force from Company C, 61st Infantry, and supported by artillery and airstrikes, the American units killed more than 20 PAVN for 6 US killed and 55 wounded in the two-and-one-half hour battle that followed.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|391}}\n\nOn 11 September, Company D, [[11th Infantry Regiment (United States)#Vietnam War|11th Infantry Regiment]] engaged a PAVN force of unknown strength from the [[27th Independent Regiment]] occupying bunkers near the \"Market Place,\" 4&nbsp;km northeast of Con Thien. The Company called for air and artillery strikes while a platoon of tanks from the 1st Battalion, 77th Armored moved up reinforce. At 18:30 the PAVN attempted to break contact, but the artillery prevented their withdrawal. One group of PAVN raised a white flag, so the American gunners ceased fire momentarily to allow the group to surrender, instead the PAVN broke and ran and the artillery barrage resumed. A later sweep of the area found 40 dead, 7 were captured.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|392}}\n\nOn 13 September following Arclight and naval and land artillery strikes 3 Brigade task forces from the 5th Infantry Division attacked into the DMZ northeast of Con Thien. To the east the 1st Squadron, [[7th ARVN Armored Cavalry]], supported by two platoons from Company A, 3rd Tank Battalion, simultaneously attacked to the north and northeast of A-2 and Gio Linh. The ARVN achieved almost immediate contact. The Marine tanks providing a base of fire for the advancing ARVN infantry fired 90mm [[Canister shot|canister]] and high-explosive rounds and their machine guns to break through the PAVN defenses killing 73 PAVN. Following in the wake of the tanks, and supported by helicopter gunships, the ARVN infantry killed an additional 68 PAVN and captured one. On the left flank, after encountering mines and antitank fire, the three Army task forces joined the action, accounting for another 35 PAVN and seizing a large cache of mortar rounds. The allied forces reached their northernmost objectives, turned south, and returned to their bases by late afternoon. The captured PAVN soldier identified his unit as an element of the [[138th Regiment]] which had assumed control of the 27th Independent Regiment's area of operations, due to the heavy casualties suffered by the regiment in recent months.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|393}}\n\nIn late September heavy monsoon rains had swollen the Ben Hai River, forcing remnants of the 320th Division and independent regiments north across the river, but military intelligence indicated that some groups had been trapped in the south by the rising water. On 26 September Companies B, C, and D, 11th Infantry moved out from positions at C-2 and C-2 Bridge. In coordination with the ARVN 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 2nd Regiment, and the 3rd Marines, the companies moved to a position west of Con Thien and then attacked north across the southern boundary of the DMZ, toward the Dong Be Lao mountain complex. During an 8-day patrol into the DMZ, they encountered minimal opposition from the PAVN rearguard. Searches of numerous bunkers and other complexes indicated that the PAVN had only recently abandoned the positions.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|393}}\n\n==October 1968==\nOn 11 October a brigade mechanized infantry and tank force, composed of Companies B and C, 61st Infantry and Company B, 77th Armored, engaged a platoon of PAVN in heavily fortified bunkers, 2.5&nbsp;km northeast of Con Thien. The PAVN used RPGs and 60mm mortars to knock out 3 M-48s and one [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M-113]]. Mines disabled another two M-48s and one M-113, killing 3 and wounding 20. After five hours of battle 26 PAVN were killed.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|394}}\n\nDespite heavy rain during October, ground and aerial reconnaissance missions indicated the presence of a sizable PAVN force south of the Ben Hai River between Gio Linh and Con Thien. On 23 October the brigade task force, composed of three companies of the dismounted 1st Battalion, 61st Infantry attacked north from A-3 and Con Thien into the DMZ and then eastward along the Ben Hai River toward the ARVN 2nd Regiment and Company H, 9th Marines which had earlier trapped a PAVN force killing 112. As the task force continued eastward during the 24th, through Kinh Mon, Tan Mon, and An Xa along an abandoned railroad, Company A engaged a PAVN platoon, killing seven. At 08:30 on 25 October, Company A encountered a PAVN battalion in well-fortified bunkers, while Company B came under heavy small arms and mortar fire. By 10:30 the engaged companies had linked up, and while Company A attacked to the northeast against the enemy's flank, Company B assaulted and overran the enemy position, capturing one 82mm mortar, two 60mm mortars, and two 0.50-caliber machine guns. Both companies, later reinforced by Company B, 77th Armor, remained in contact until 18:00 killing 231 PAVN for the loss of 4 killed and 24 wounded.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|395}}\n\nOn 22 October COMUSMACV [[Creighton Abrams|General Abrams]], ordered all construction and planning efforts associated with the anti-infiltration effort halted. Under the new plan, referred to as ''Duel Blade'', allied forces, supported by air, artillery, and naval gunfire, would maintain a mobile posture and actively resist infiltration from the North by maintaining a comprehensive surveillance effort. While ground reconnaissance would be a part of the effort, attended and unattended detection devices or sensors would provide a majority of the surveillance capability.

At the 3/3 Marines operations center at Strongpoint A-3 the Battalion Commander ordered Company L to establish blocking positions while Company M manoevured to relieve Company K. Company M was unable to reach the ambush site before dark and Company L returned to Strongpoint A-3, while Companies K and M dug in for the night.

The two Marine companies called in artillery and air upon the PAVN, the bulk of which disengaged, leaving a company behind to fight a rearguard action. PAVN artillery from north of the DMZ answered the American supporting arms with a 400-round barrage of its own on the Marines. Marine casualties were two killed and nine wounded for 83 NVA killed.

On 11 July, 4&nbsp;km northeast of Con Thien, elements of 3/9 Marines discovered a reinforced PAVN platoon in the open. Fixing the PAVN in place with small arms fire, the Marines, with air, artillery, and tank support, launched a coordinated air-ground attack through the area killing more than 30 PAVN. The 9th Marines uncovered and destroyed numerous PAVN fortifications, a few of the positions were lightly defended, but the majority were abandoned. One bunker system discovered 4&nbsp;km meters due north of Con Thien spanned more than 1&nbsp;km and included 242 well-constructed bunkers. Supplies and equipment abandoned included weapons, 935 mortar rounds, 500 pounds of explosives, 55 antitank mines, and 500 pounds of rice. The Marines also found 29 bodies, killed by artillery and airstrikes during the advance on the complex.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|363}}\n\nOn 21 July 2/9 Marines discovered a major PAVN bunker complex 6&nbsp;km southwest of Con Thien. Composed of 60 A-frame timbered bunkers built into the sides of bomb craters, each with an average overhead cover 10-feet-thick, the system was connected to a large command bunker by a network of interconnecting tunnels. The command bunker featured an aperture overlooking Con Thien and [[Charlie 2|C-2]] and documents found in the bunker indicated that the PAVN had been observing and reporting the movement of helicopters, tanks, and trucks entering and leaving Con Thien and C-2.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|365}}\n\n==August 1968==\nEarly August saw little contact with the PAVN other than an encounter by Company F, 9th Marines with 30 PAVN, 3&nbsp;km east of Con Thien. In the face of artillery and fixed-wing support, the PAVN broke contact and the Marines began a sweep through the area during which they regained contact. The PAVN again broke and ran, and Company F moved through the area, capturing a number of weapons and counting 11 dead.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|387}}\n\nOn 15 August, a PAVN company attacked a four-man Marine reconnaissance team southeast of Con Thien near the abandoned airstrip at [[Nam \u0110\u00f4ng District|Nam \u0110\u00f4ng]]. The patrol returned fire and requested reinforcement, while simultaneously calling in preplanned artillery fires. Within minutes a platoon from Company A, 1st Marines, accompanied by three tanks, moved out of positions 1&nbsp;km away and headed south to assist. The coordinated attack, which included more than 150 rounds of 105mm artillery, 40 rounds of 4.2-inch mortar, 75 rounds from the 90mm guns of the tanks, and airstrikes by Marine UH-1E gunships accounted for several PAVN dead.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|389}}\n\nAs PAVN activity continued to increase in the eastern DMZ, particularly north of Con Thien, the Marines decided to act. In addition to sightings of enemy tanks, Marine fighter pilots and aerial observers reported spotting trucks, truck parks, camouflaged revetments, storage bunkers, and trenchlines. Of special interest were repeated sightings of low, slow moving lights during hours of darkness which, it was assumed, came from enemy helicopters thought to be resupplying forward positions with high priority cargo such as ammunition and medical supplies or conducting medevacs. On 19 August, after 60 [[Operation Arc Light|Arclight]] strikes [[2nd Battalion, 1st Marines#Vietnam War|2nd Battalion, 1st Marines]] assaulted into three landing zones in the Trung Son region of the southern DMZ, 5&nbsp;km north of Con Thien. Supported by a platoon of tanks from [[3rd Tank Battalion#Vietnam War|3rd Tank Battalion]], 2/1 Marines swept the area but found no evidence of use by [[VPAF]] helicopters. During the extraction one [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46 Sea Knight]] was destroyed by a command detonated mine, killing 4 Marines.\n\nWhile the assault claimed no PAVN casualties, it did scatter PAVN forces in the area. On the morning of the 19th, Bravo Company, 2/1 and the Army's Company A, [[77th Armor Regiment (United States)|77th Armored Regiment]] engaged an enemy platoon while supported by M-48s from 3rd Tank Battalion, killing 26 PAVN. 6&nbsp;km southwest of Con Thien  Mike Company, 3/9 Marines intercepted a reinforced PAVN platoon, under the cover of airstrikes and artillery they kill 30 NVA and captured 2. On 20 August, 2 PAVN squads attacked Companies G and H, 2/9 Marines with small arms, RPGs, mortars, and artillery. The Marines, supported by 5 M-48s from 3rd Tank Battalion forced the PAVN to withdraw northward, leaving their dead. On 21 August, Company I, 9th Marines began receiving sniper fire and within an hour, the company had engaged a PAVN unit of undetermined size, firing small arms and grenades, responding with accurate rocket, mortar, and artillery fire, the Marines forced the PAVN to break contact and withdraw to the north. A search of the area found 14 PAVN dead and 12 weapons.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|389}}\n\nOn 24 August at 17:00, Marine reconnaissance team ''Tender Rancho'' was moving 7&nbsp;km southeast of Con Thien near Dao Xuyen, when it surprised a group of 15 bivouacked PAVN troops killing 6. Within minutes the team received a barrage of 82mm mortars and immediately formed a 360-degree security. 90 minutes later gunships arrived on station and informed the team that the PAVN surrounded them. At 19:30 despite receiving 0.50 caliber and 82mm mortar fire helicopters inserted a reinforced platoon from Company D, 1st Marines to assist. Meanwhile, additional platoons from Company D, along with Company C, moving overland from the east took up blocking positions north of the encircled reconnaissance team before dark. At daylight on 25 August, Marine helicopters inserted the remainder of Company D. During the insertion a [[Sikorsky H-34#Vietnam War|CH-34]], while dodging enemy fire, struck a tree breaking off the tail section, killing 3 and wounding 14. With the arrival of elements of 1/3 Marines and Company M, 3/9 Marines later in the day, the Marines effectively cordoned the area, preventing a PAVN withdrawal. During the remainder of the 25th and into the 26th, as Companies C and D, 1st Marines pushed southward toward the other blocking forces, the PAVN made several unsuccessful attempts to break the cordon. By the end of 26 August, after three days of fighting, the PAVN had suffered 78 killed while the Marines suffered 11 killed and 58 wounded.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|389\u2013390}}\n\nOn 31 August 1st Marines was relieved of responsibility for the Kentucky area of operations by the Army's 1st Brigade, [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division (Mechanized)]].<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|390}}\n\n==September 1968==\nOn 4 September, a platoon from Company A, [[61st Infantry Regiment (United States)|61st Infantry]] was sent to the relief of Company M, 3/9 Marines which was engaged in battle with a reinforced PAVN company in bunkers west of Con Thien. Joined by a reaction force from Company C, 61st Infantry, and supported by artillery and airstrikes, the American units killed more than 20 PAVN for 6 US killed and 55 wounded in the two-and-one-half hour battle that followed.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|391}}\n\nOn 11 September, Company D, [[11th Infantry Regiment (United States)#Vietnam War|11th Infantry Regiment]] engaged a PAVN force of unknown strength from the [[27th Independent Regiment]] occupying bunkers near the \"Market Place,\" 4&nbsp;km northeast of Con Thien. The Company called for air and artillery strikes while a platoon of tanks from the 1st Battalion, 77th Armored moved up reinforce. At 18:30 the PAVN attempted to break contact, but the artillery prevented their withdrawal. One group of PAVN raised a white flag, so the American gunners ceased fire momentarily to allow the group to surrender, instead the PAVN broke and ran and the artillery barrage resumed. A later sweep of the area found 40 dead, 7 were captured.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|392}}\n\nOn 13 September following Arclight and naval and land artillery strikes 3 Brigade task forces from the 5th Infantry Division attacked into the DMZ northeast of Con Thien. To the east the 1st Squadron, [[7th ARVN Armored Cavalry]], supported by two platoons from Company A, 3rd Tank Battalion, simultaneously attacked to the north and northeast of A-2 and Gio Linh. The ARVN achieved almost immediate contact. The Marine tanks providing a base of fire for the advancing ARVN infantry fired 90mm [[Canister shot|canister]] and high-explosive rounds and their machine guns to break through the PAVN defenses killing 73 PAVN. Following in the wake of the tanks, and supported by helicopter gunships, the ARVN infantry killed an additional 68 PAVN and captured one. On the left flank, after encountering mines and antitank fire, the three Army task forces joined the action, accounting for another 35 PAVN and seizing a large cache of mortar rounds. The allied forces reached their northernmost objectives, turned south, and returned to their bases by late afternoon. The captured PAVN soldier identified his unit as an element of the [[138th Regiment]] which had assumed control of the 27th Independent Regiment's area of operations, due to the heavy casualties suffered by the regiment in recent months.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|393}}\n\nIn late September heavy monsoon rains had swollen the Ben Hai River, forcing remnants of the 320th Division and independent regiments north across the river, but military intelligence indicated that some groups had been trapped in the south by the rising water. On 26 September Companies B, C, and D, 11th Infantry moved out from positions at C-2 and C-2 Bridge. In coordination with the ARVN 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 2nd Regiment, and the 3rd Marines, the companies moved to a position west of Con Thien and then attacked north across the southern boundary of the DMZ, toward the Dong Be Lao mountain complex. During an 8-day patrol into the DMZ, they encountered minimal opposition from the PAVN rearguard. Searches of numerous bunkers and other complexes indicated that the PAVN had only recently abandoned the positions.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|393}}\n\n==October 1968==\nOn 11 October a brigade mechanized infantry and tank force, composed of Companies B and C, 61st Infantry and Company B, 77th Armored, engaged a platoon of PAVN in heavily fortified bunkers, 2.5&nbsp;km northeast of Con Thien. The PAVN used RPGs and 60mm mortars to knock out 3 M-48s and one [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M-113]]. Mines disabled another two M-48s and one M-113, killing 3 and wounding 20. After five hours of battle 26 PAVN were killed.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|394}}\n\nDespite heavy rain during October, ground and aerial reconnaissance missions indicated the presence of a sizable PAVN force south of the Ben Hai River between Gio Linh and Con Thien. On 23 October the brigade task force, composed of three companies of the dismounted 1st Battalion, 61st Infantry attacked north from A-3 and Con Thien into the DMZ and then eastward along the Ben Hai River toward the ARVN 2nd Regiment and Company H, 9th Marines which had earlier trapped a PAVN force killing 112. As the task force continued eastward during the 24th, through Kinh Mon, Tan Mon, and An Xa along an abandoned railroad, Company A engaged a PAVN platoon, killing seven. At 08:30 on 25 October, Company A encountered a PAVN battalion in well-fortified bunkers, while Company B came under heavy small arms and mortar fire. By 10:30 the engaged companies had linked up, and while Company A attacked to the northeast against the enemy's flank, Company B assaulted and overran the enemy position, capturing one 82mm mortar, two 60mm mortars, and two 0.50-caliber machine guns. Both companies, later reinforced by Company B, 77th Armor, remained in contact until 18:00 killing 231 PAVN for the loss of 4 killed and 24 wounded.<ref name=Shulimson/>{{rp|395}}\n\nOn 22 October COMUSMACV [[Creighton Abrams|General Abrams]], ordered all construction and planning efforts associated with the anti-infiltration effort halted.
