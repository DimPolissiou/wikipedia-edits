Chances were few and far between in the first half, as [[Rom\u00e1rio]] had Brazil's best chance of the half with a header, but he headed straight at [[Gianluca Pagliuca]]. Late in the first half, [[Daniele Massaro]] had what would turn out to be Italy's best chance of the match, as he had a good opportunity from the edge of the box after a counter-attack, but his shot was saved by [[Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel]]. The second half was largely devoid of scoring chances, as Brazil were unable to break through the center back pairing of [[Franco Baresi]] and [[Paolo Maldini]]. The lack of attacking play in the match was down to strong holding midfield play by [[Dino Baggio]] for Italy, and by both [[Dunga]] and [[Mauro Silva]] for Brazil.<ref name=\"fifa.com\">https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/usa1994/index.html</ref>\n\nAs extra time began, chances would become more plentiful, as Brazil began to dominate play. Rom\u00e1rio had another chance early in extra time after Pagliuca made an ill advised decision to come for a cross, leaving the goal exposed, but [[Bebeto]] was unable to find him. [[Roberto Baggio]], who had been quiet for most of the match having picked up an injury earlier in the tournament, had his only sight of goal in the entire match in the first half of extra time, hitting a shot from around 25 yards, but Taffarel pushed the shot over. [[Zinho]] had a chance on the stroke of halftime in extra time, hitting his shot well from inside the area, but Pagliuca saved well at his near post. In the second half of extra time, Rom\u00e1rio missed a golden chance to hand Brazil the trophy, as [[Cafu]] had found him inside the six yard box. With Pagliuca at least four yards away from him on the other side of the goal, and the entire goal to aim at, the off balance Rom\u00e1rio put his shot wide of the post.<ref name=\"fifa.com\"/>\n\nThis was the first time the World Cup would be decided on penalties. Italian captain Baresi took the first penalty and blazed his penalty over the bar. Brazilian center back [[M\u00e1rcio Roberto dos Santos|Marcio Santos]] went next, but Pagliuca saved the Brazilian  defender's effort low to his right. [[Demetrio Albertini]] went next for Italy, scoring his penalty into the top corner. Rom\u00e1rio was next for Brazil, and he scored his penalty, placing it so far in the corner that it went in off the post, tying the score at 1\u20131. [[Alberigo Evani]] went third for Italy, he scored, putting his penalty high and in the middle, as Taffarel dove to the right. [[Branco (footballer)|Branco]] went next for Brazil, and he scored in the bottom left corner. Massaro, who had scored twice in the Champions League Final less than two months previously, went next for Italy, but he was unable to put the ball in Taffarel's net just as he had been unable to do in the match, as the Brazilian keeper saved to his left. Brazilian captain Dunga was next, and he comfortably placed his shot into the bottom left corner, making it match point. With Italy needing to score to keep their dreams alive, talisman Baggio stepped up to take the penalty. In what would become an infamous moment in World Cup History, Baggio blazed his penalty over the bar, in similar fashion to Baresi, and this gave Brazil their fourth title.<ref name=\"fifa.com\"/><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWI6Y9V5fvI</ref>\n\n===Details===\n<section begin=Final />{{Football box\n|date = July 17, 1994\n|time = 12:30 [[Pacific Time Zone|PDT]]\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|BRA}}\n|score = 0\u20130\n|aet = yes\n|report = https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=3459/match=3104/index.html\n|team2 = {{fb|ITA}}\n|stadium = [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]\n|attendance = 94,194\n|referee = [[S\u00e1ndor Puhl]] ([[Hungarian Football Federation|Hungary]])\n|penalties1 = [[M\u00e1rcio Roberto dos Santos|M\u00e1rcio Santos]] {{penmiss}}<br />[[Rom\u00e1rio]] {{pengoal}}<br />[[Branco (footballer)|Branco]] {{pengoal}}<br />[[Dunga]] {{pengoal}}\n|penaltyscore = 3\u20132\n|penalties2 = {{penmiss}} [[Franco Baresi|Baresi]]<br />{{pengoal}} [[Demetrio Albertini|Albertini]]<br />{{pengoal}} [[Alberigo Evani|Evani]]<br />{{penmiss}} [[Daniele Massaro|Massaro]]<br />{{penmiss}} [[Roberto Baggio|R.

Chances were few and far between in the first half, as [[Rom\u00e1rio]] had Brazil's best chance of the half with a header, but he headed straight at [[Gianluca Pagliuca]]. Late in the first half, [[Daniele Massaro]] had what would turn out to be Italy's best chance of the match, as he had a good opportunity from the edge of the box after a counter-attack, but his shot was saved by [[Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel]]. The second half was largely devoid of scoring chances, as Brazil were unable to break through the center back pairing of [[Franco Baresi]] and [[Paolo Maldini]]. The lack of attacking play in the match was down to strong holding midfield play by [[Dino Baggio]] for Italy, and by both [[Dunga]] and [[Mauro Silva]] for Brazil.<ref name=\"fifa.com\">https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/usa1994/index.html</ref>\n\nAs extra time began, chances would become more plentiful, as Brazil began to dominate play. Rom\u00e1rio had another chance early in extra time after Pagliuca made an ill advised decision to come for a cross, leaving the goal exposed, but [[Bebeto]] was unable to find him. [[Roberto Baggio]], who had been quiet for most of the match having picked up an injury earlier in the tournament, had his only sight of goal in the entire match in the first half of extra time, hitting a shot from around 25 yards, but Taffarel pushed the shot over. [[Zinho]] had a chance on the stroke of halftime in extra time, hitting his shot well from inside the area, but Pagliuca saved well at his near post. In the second half of extra time, Rom\u00e1rio missed a golden chance to hand Brazil the trophy, as [[Cafu]] had found him inside the six yard box. With Pagliuca at least four yards away from him on the other side of the goal, and the entire goal to aim at, the off balance Rom\u00e1rio put his shot wide of the post.<ref name=\"fifa.com\"/>\n\nThis was the first time the World Cup would be decided on penalties. Italian captain Baresi took the first penalty and blazed his penalty over the bar. Brazilian center back [[M\u00e1rcio Roberto dos Santos|Marcio Santos]] went next, but Pagliuca saved the Brazilian  defender's effort low to his right. [[Demetrio Albertini]] went next for Italy, scoring his penalty into the top corner. Rom\u00e1rio was next for Brazil, and he scored his penalty, placing it so far in the corner that it went in off the post, tying the score at 1\u20131. [[Alberigo Evani]] went third for Italy, he scored, putting his penalty high and in the middle, as Taffarel dove to the right. [[Branco (footballer)|Branco]] went next for Brazil, and he scored in the bottom left corner. Massaro, who had scored twice in the Champions League Final less than two months previously, went next for Italy, but he was unable to put the ball in Taffarel's net just as he had been unable to do in the match, as the Brazilian keeper saved to his left. Brazilian captain Dunga was next, and he comfortably placed his shot into the bottom left corner, making it match point. With Italy needing to score to keep their dreams alive, talisman Baggio stepped up to take the penalty. In what would become an infamous moment in World Cup History, Baggio blazed his penalty over the bar, in similar fashion to Baresi, and this gave Brazil their fourth title.<ref name=\"fifa.com\"/><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWI6Y9V5fvI</ref>\n\n===Details===\n<section begin=Final />{{Football box\n|date = July 17, 1994\n|time = 12:30 [[Pacific Time Zone|PDT]]\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|BRA}}\n|score = 0\u20130\n|aet = yes\n|report = https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=3459/match=3104/index.html\n|team2 = {{fb|ITA}}\n|stadium = [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]\n|attendance = 94,194\n|referee = [[S\u00e1ndor Puhl]] ([[Hungarian Football Federation|Hungary]])\n|penalties1 = [[M\u00e1rcio Roberto dos Santos|M\u00e1rcio Santos]] {{penmiss}}<br />[[Rom\u00e1rio]] {{pengoal}}<br />[[Branco (footballer)|Branco]] {{pengoal}}<br />[[Dunga]] {{pengoal}}\n|penaltyscore = 3\u20132\n|penalties2 = {{penmiss}} [[Franco Baresi|Baresi]]<br />{{pengoal}} [[Demetrio Albertini|Albertini]]<br />{{pengoal}} [[Alberigo Evani|Evani]]<br />{{penmiss}} [[Daniele Massaro|Massaro]]<br />{{penmiss}} [[Roberto Baggio|R.

{"title_page": "Multilingualism in Luxembourg", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=April 2012}}\n[[Multilingualism]] is a part of everyday life for the population of [[Luxembourg]]. Legally and socially, different sectors of Luxembourg use [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], which is a variety of [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]] with a large number of loanwords from French. Additionally, most citizens learn [[English language|English]] and may study other languages as well. A substantial immigrant population has brought numerous [[immigrant language]]s to the small state, notably [[Portuguese Luxembourger|Portuguese, which is spoken by more than one-fifth of the population]]. However, the different languages are used in different social situations.\n\n==Official languages==\nThe use of languages for legal and administrative purposes is regulated by a law promulgated in 1984, including the following provisions:<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''M\u00e9morial A'' no. 16 (27 February 1984), pp. 196\u2013197: [http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1984/0162702/index.html \"Loi du 24 f\u00e9vrier 1984 sur le r\u00e9gime des langues\".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203005510/http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1984/0162702/index.html |date=2006-02-03 }}</ref>\n\n* Article 1: The national language of the Luxembourgers is [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]].\n* Article 2: The laws are in [[French language|French]].\n* Article 3: The language of the government: Luxembourgish, [[German language|German]] and French can be used.\n* Article 4: Administrative questions: If a citizen asks a question in Luxembourgish, German or French, the administration must reply, as far as possible, in the language in which the question was asked.\n\nIn many other multilingual countries, such as [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Canada]], the distribution of the languages is geographic, but in Luxembourg it is functional\u2014that is, the choice of language depends on the situation.\n\n==Education==\nAt school, all students are taught in all three official languages, although divided by age group and subject matter.  At [[primary school]], the courses are taught in German and explanations are often given in Luxembourgish.  In general, at [[secondary school]], up until the 9th grade, every subject is taught in German, except for mathematics and sciences (which are taught in French). From 10th to 13th grade, the language use depends on what level the students are in: In the more difficult level, as well as at the commerce and administrative division, the courses are mostly in French, but throughout the whole of secondary school, explanations are often given in Luxembourgish. The easier level on the other hand tends not to switch to French.\n\n==Government==\nGovernment websites are primarily written in French,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gouvernement.lu/|title=gouvernement.lu - Accueil|website=www.gouvernement.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/fr/index.html|title=Luxembourg|access-date=2017-11-10|language=fr}}</ref> but there are also parts written for foreigners in other languages such as English<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/index.html|title=Luxembourg|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103223719/http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/index.html|archive-date=2014-11-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> and German.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/de/index.html|title=Luxemburg|access-date=2017-11-10|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113135300/http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/de/index.html|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> In Luxembourg's parliament the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]], [[Bill (law)|bills]] are first written in German. Then the language of debate is in Luxembourgish, but sometimes also in French (e.g., when laws are cited). Laws are voted and codified in French. \n\nThe country's head of state, the [[Monarchy of Luxembourg|Grand-Duke]]'s website is in French,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/index.html|title=Cour Grand-Ducale de Luxembourg - Accueil|website=www.monarchie.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref> however his personal Christmas speech is done in Luxembourgish<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tele.rtl.lu/emissiounen/de-journal/3026611.html|title=RTL - de Journal - Chr\u00ebschtusprooch vum Grand-Duc|date=2014-12-24|website=RTL}}</ref> ''(although a French translation is provided<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/actualites/discours/2014/12/discours-noel-fr/index.html|title=Discours de No\u00ebl prononc\u00e9 par S.A.R. le Grand-Duc (version FR) - Cour Grand-Ducale de Luxembourg - D\u00e9cembre 2014|website=www.monarchie.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref>).''  In the Grand-Duke's Christmas speech in 2018 like in the past, he spoke in Luxembourgish for the most part of the speech. However when he was talking about the importance of [[Demographics of Luxembourg#Foreign population in Luxembourg|foreigners in Luxembourg]], he suddenly spoke in French as this the most used language that resident foreigners use. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/actualites/discours/2018/12/discours-noel-lu/index.html|title=Discours de No\u00ebl prononc\u00e9 par S.A.R. le Grand-Duc - Cour Grand-Ducale de Luxembourg - D\u00e9cembre 2018|date=2018-12-24|website=www.monarchie.lu|language=Luxembourgish, French|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\n==Mass media==\nIn the written press, most newspapers such as ''[[Tageblatt]]'' and ''[[L\u00ebtzebuerger Journal]]'' are in German, while there are a few such as [[Le Quotidien (newspaper)|''Le Quotidien'']] that are in French.  On the other hand, the newspaper of record ''[[Luxemburger Wort]]'' is trilingual with most articles written in German, but also sometimes written in French and Luxembourgish, often on the same page.\n\nOn TV and on the radio, Luxembourgish is mainly used, for example the main news programme [[RTL T\u00e9l\u00e9 L\u00ebtzebuerg|RTL]]'s ''de Journal''. Spoken Luxembourgish used in news broadcasts tends to be strongly influenced by standard German in pronunciation and idiom.<ref name=\"textual\">Fernand Hoffman, \"Textual varieties of L\u00ebtzebuergesch\", in Newton, p. 219</ref> Radio broadcasters are under pressure to translate news releases sourced from German press agencies in real time and have no special training in the prose style of Luxembourgish. As a result, news tends to be superficially translated into Luxembourgish. Syntax mostly follows standard German and many words and idioms from standard German appear unmodified.<ref name=\"textual\" /> Phonology is also affected with the resulting use of intonation phrases alien to Luxembourgish.<ref name=\"developments\">Fernand Hoffman, \"L\u00ebtzebuergesch, spoken and written, developments and desirabilities\", in Newton, pp. 114 - 118</ref>\n\n=== Advertising ===\nIn terms of [[advertising]], which language is used depends on three factors; media, audience and origin. In written advertisements like [[billboard]]s, newspaper and magazine adverts, [[Mail order|catalogues]] and posters, the usual language of communication is French. On occasion to give a local flavour, it is written in part in Luxembourgish. [[Signage|Public signage]] is usually in French, with occasional markings in Luxembourgish, German and/or English.\n\nFor [[Advertisement film|television commercials]] broadcasting on RTL, if the advert is for an international product or service like a car or a television, it is entirely in French. However, if it is a domestic product or service like for example like [[:lb:Sources Rosport|Rosport]] mineral water or [[Luxair]], the spoken language is in Luxembourgish with the taglines in French, or less frequently in Luxembourgish or English.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sources Rosport|title=Rosport mat: Introducing Zitroun|date=2018-04-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgUmr8BBcUM|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Luxair Luxembourg Airlines|title=Luxair commercial from 1982|date=2015-10-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-Y07TZHfyc|language=Luxembourgish, French|accessdate=2017-12-05}}</ref>\n\n==Daily use==\nGenerally, Luxembourgish is used for most day-to-day life in informal settings throughout the country. Standard German and French are reserved for formal settings, ceremonies and French in particular is commonly used in the hospitality industry.

Legally and socially, different sectors of Luxembourg use [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], which is a variety of [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]] with a large number of loanwords from French. Additionally, most citizens learn [[English language|English]] and may study other languages as well. A substantial immigrant population has brought numerous [[immigrant language]]s to the small state, notably [[Portuguese Luxembourger|Portuguese, which is spoken by more than one-fifth of the population]]. However, the different languages are used in different social situations.\n\n==Official languages==\nThe use of languages for legal and administrative purposes is regulated by a law promulgated in 1984, including the following provisions:<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''M\u00e9morial A'' no. 16 (27 February 1984), pp. 196\u2013197: [http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1984/0162702/index.html \"Loi du 24 f\u00e9vrier 1984 sur le r\u00e9gime des langues\".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203005510/http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1984/0162702/index.html |date=2006-02-03 }}</ref>\n\n* Article 1: The national language of the Luxembourgers is [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]].\n* Article 2: The laws are in [[French language|French]].\n* Article 3: The language of the government: Luxembourgish, [[German language|German]] and French can be used.\n* Article 4: Administrative questions: If a citizen asks a question in Luxembourgish, German or French, the administration must reply, as far as possible, in the language in which the question was asked.\n\nIn many other multilingual countries, such as [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Canada]], the distribution of the languages is geographic, but in Luxembourg it is functional\u2014that is, the choice of language depends on the situation.\n\n==Education==\nAt school, all students are taught in all three official languages, although divided by age group and subject matter.  At [[primary school]], the courses are taught in German and explanations are often given in Luxembourgish.  In general, at [[secondary school]], up until the 9th grade, every subject is taught in German, except for mathematics and sciences (which are taught in French). From 10th to 13th grade, the language use depends on what level the students are in: In the more difficult level, as well as at the commerce and administrative division, the courses are mostly in French, but throughout the whole of secondary school, explanations are often given in Luxembourgish. The easier level on the other hand tends not to switch to French.\n\n==Government==\nGovernment websites are primarily written in French,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gouvernement.lu/|title=gouvernement.lu - Accueil|website=www.gouvernement.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/fr/index.html|title=Luxembourg|access-date=2017-11-10|language=fr}}</ref> but there are also parts written for foreigners in other languages such as English<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/index.html|title=Luxembourg|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103223719/http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/index.html|archive-date=2014-11-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> and German.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/de/index.html|title=Luxemburg|access-date=2017-11-10|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113135300/http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/de/index.html|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> In Luxembourg's parliament the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]], [[Bill (law)|bills]] are first written in German. Then the language of debate is in Luxembourgish, but sometimes also in French (e.g., when laws are cited). Laws are voted and codified in French. \n\nThe country's head of state, the [[Monarchy of Luxembourg|Grand-Duke]]'s website is in French,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/index.html|title=Cour Grand-Ducale de Luxembourg - Accueil|website=www.monarchie.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref> however his personal Christmas speech is done in Luxembourgish<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tele.rtl.lu/emissiounen/de-journal/3026611.html|title=RTL - de Journal - Chr\u00ebschtusprooch vum Grand-Duc|date=2014-12-24|website=RTL}}</ref> ''(although a French translation is provided<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/actualites/discours/2014/12/discours-noel-fr/index.html|title=Discours de No\u00ebl prononc\u00e9 par S.A.R. le Grand-Duc (version FR) - Cour Grand-Ducale de Luxembourg - D\u00e9cembre 2014|website=www.monarchie.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref>).''  In the Grand-Duke's Christmas speech in 2018 like in the past, he spoke in Luxembourgish for the most part of the speech. However when he was talking about the importance of [[Demographics of Luxembourg#Foreign population in Luxembourg|foreigners in Luxembourg]], he suddenly spoke in French as this the most used language that resident foreigners use. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/actualites/discours/2018/12/discours-noel-lu/index.html|title=Discours de No\u00ebl prononc\u00e9 par S.A.R. le Grand-Duc - Cour Grand-Ducale de Luxembourg - D\u00e9cembre 2018|date=2018-12-24|website=www.monarchie.lu|language=Luxembourgish, French|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\n==Mass media==\nIn the written press, most newspapers such as ''[[Tageblatt]]'' and ''[[L\u00ebtzebuerger Journal]]'' are in German, while there are a few such as [[Le Quotidien (newspaper)|''Le Quotidien'']] that are in French.  On the other hand, the newspaper of record ''[[Luxemburger Wort]]'' is trilingual with most articles written in German, but also sometimes written in French and Luxembourgish, often on the same page.\n\nOn TV and on the radio, Luxembourgish is mainly used, for example the main news programme [[RTL T\u00e9l\u00e9 L\u00ebtzebuerg|RTL]]'s ''de Journal''. Spoken Luxembourgish used in news broadcasts tends to be strongly influenced by standard German in pronunciation and idiom.<ref name=\"textual\">Fernand Hoffman, \"Textual varieties of L\u00ebtzebuergesch\", in Newton, p. 219</ref> Radio broadcasters are under pressure to translate news releases sourced from German press agencies in real time and have no special training in the prose style of Luxembourgish. As a result, news tends to be superficially translated into Luxembourgish. Syntax mostly follows standard German and many words and idioms from standard German appear unmodified.<ref name=\"textual\" /> Phonology is also affected with the resulting use of intonation phrases alien to Luxembourgish.<ref name=\"developments\">Fernand Hoffman, \"L\u00ebtzebuergesch, spoken and written, developments and desirabilities\", in Newton, pp. 114 - 118</ref>\n\n=== Advertising ===\nIn terms of [[advertising]], which language is used depends on three factors; media, audience and origin. In written advertisements like [[billboard]]s, newspaper and magazine adverts, [[Mail order|catalogues]] and posters, the usual language of communication is French. On occasion to give a local flavour, it is written in part in Luxembourgish. [[Signage|Public signage]] is usually in French, with occasional markings in Luxembourgish, German and/or English.\n\nFor [[Advertisement film|television commercials]] broadcasting on RTL, if the advert is for an international product or service like a car or a television, it is entirely in French. However, if it is a domestic product or service like for example like [[:lb:Sources Rosport|Rosport]] mineral water or [[Luxair]], the spoken language is in Luxembourgish with the taglines in French, or less frequently in Luxembourgish or English.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sources Rosport|title=Rosport mat: Introducing Zitroun|date=2018-04-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgUmr8BBcUM|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Luxair Luxembourg Airlines|title=Luxair commercial from 1982|date=2015-10-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-Y07TZHfyc|language=Luxembourgish, French|accessdate=2017-12-05}}</ref>\n\n==Daily use==\nGenerally, Luxembourgish is used for most day-to-day life in informal settings throughout the country. Standard German and French are reserved for formal settings, ceremonies and French in particular is commonly used in the hospitality industry. Most newspapers and printed media is in Standard German.<ref name=Hoffman>Jean-Paul Hoffman, \"L\u00ebtzebuergesch and its competitors: Language contact in Luxembourg Today\" in Newton, p. 102</ref>\n\n==Written Luxembourgish==\n\nLuxembourgish has a literary tradition that began in the 1820s with the development of serious forms of poetry, followed by drama and eventually narrative prose.<ref name=developments/> However, the average Luxembourger finds Luxembourgish texts difficult to read.

The extreme pachyostosis has been suggested to have been a protection against attacks by crocodiles.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Extinction ==\nMost of the remains assigned to the species are known from [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] archaeological sites, suggesting they were hunted by people. The last known date for the species dates between 6641 and 6009 cal BP, during the [[Neolithic]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fernandez|first=Philippe|last2=Bouzouggar|first2=Abdeljalil|last3=Collina-Girard|first3=Jacques|last4=Coulon|first4=Mathieu|date=2015-07|title=The last occurrence of Megaceroides algericus Lyddekker, 1890 (Mammalia, Cervidae) during the middle Holocene in the cave of Bizmoune (Morocco, Essaouira region)|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S104061821500230X|journal=Quaternary International|language=en|volume=374|pages=154\u2013167|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2015.03.034}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cenozoic mammals of Africa]]\n[[Category:Pleistocene even-toed ungulates]]\n[[Category:Holocene extinctions]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1890]]\n", "name_user": "Lord Bolingbroke", "label": "safe", "comment": "reformat date values to resolvea CS1 error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaceroides_algericus"}
