Serrano also directed a video for [[industrial metal]] group [[Godflesh]], \"[[Crush My Soul]]\".\n\nIn 2008, Serrano's piece ''The Interpretation of Dreams (White Nigger)'' was selected to participate in [[Renaissance Society|The Renaissance Society]]'s group exhibit, \"Black Is, Black Ain't\".<ref>[http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions/Images.Black-Is-Black-Ain-t.595.5158.html Renaissance Society] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910032932/http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions/Images.Black-Is-Black-Ain-t.595.5158.html |date=September 10, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSerrano adopted the [[alter ego]] \"Brutus Faust\" to create the full-length album ''Vengeance Is Mine'' in July 2010. The album contains covers of classic songs from the 1960s, and original compositions including four songs written by Serrano's wife Irina Movmyga as well as one song co-written by Serrano, Thad DeBrock, and [[album producer]] Steve Messina of New York City\u2013based band [[Blow Up Hollywood]]. Coinciding with the release of the album are the videos ''Goo Goo Gaga'', ''Love Letters'', and ''Bad Moon Rising''. ''Goo Goo Gaga'' consists mostly of black-and-white footage from the 1940s, which makes parallels between the Depression and the present day, with the images of \"Brutus\" shot by Francesco Carrozzini. ''Love Letters'' is footage taken from cult director Joe Sarno's ''Flesh and Lace''. ''Bad Moon Rising'' consists entirely of footage Serrano compiled from several short films by John Santerineross. All of these short films were edited by Vincent V.<ref>[http://brutusfaust.com/about.php Brutus Faust.com]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/106955/andres-serrano-wants-to-be-a-rock-star|title=Andres Serrano Wants to Be a Rock Star|last=Laster|first=Paul|publisher=flavorwire|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=August 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Serrano made a work of art called ''Sign of the Times'' by collecting 200 signs from homeless people in New York Cityually paying $20 for each sign.

This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]].

During the Fall 2005 semester, while construction of the Classroom and Science/Engineering buildings was still taking place, all academic courses were conducted in the library.  Its official motto is \"Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.\"\n\nThe Library building is named after Leo and Dottie Kolligian. Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books. In addition, the library provides access to 580 databases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.ucmerced.edu/about/library-facts |title=Library Facts |publisher=UC Merced Library |accessdate=2014-06-02}}</ref>\n\nKolligian is a [[Green library]] and has Gold [[LEED certification]].<ref name=\"SignKolligian\">{{cite web|url=http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|title=Leo & Dottie Kolligian Library Sign|accessdate=20 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227010331/http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|UC Merced Golden Bobcats}}\n\nUC Merced's recently established an intercollegiate athletic program presently competes in the [[California Pacific Conference]] of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]].

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]]. The satellite campus advocated a UC education to prospective college-bound students of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, UC Merced closed its Bakersfield campus in a cost-cutting effort.

[[Jennifer Morrison]] (who plays [[Emma Swan]]) was the first to announce that she would be departing, followed by [[Rebecca Mader]] ([[Wicked Witch of the West]] / [[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena]]) after two seasons, original cast members [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] ([[Snow White]] / [[Mary Margaret Blanchard]]), [[Josh Dallas]] ([[Prince Charming]] / [[David Nolan (Once Upon a Time)|David Nolan]]) and [[Jared Gilmore]] ([[Henry Mills (Once Upon a Time)|Henry Mills]]), and [[Emilie de Ravin]] ([[Belle (Once Upon a Time)|Belle / Belle Gold]]) who joined in the second season. All six actors would make at least one appearance in season 7, with Mader and Gilmore recurring most significantly, including all for the series finale. As part of a soft reboot that would lead to a new setting and storyline, the final moments of the episode shifted to the future, where an adult Henry Mills (played by new regular [[Andrew J.

The groups that filed the motion argued that there was no longer any technical logic for the UHF discount to be restored (as UHF digital stations have typically maintained better signal quality compared to UHF transmissions in analog) and would trigger a wave of [[mergers and acquisitions]] in the broadcast television industry that would result in fewer diverse station owners.

Critics expressed concern that the rule's elimination will pave the way for at least some broadcasters to consolidate their local content to a handful of studio locations across the country (with little to no content originating in the community or markets a radio or television station serves).

The groups that filed the motion argued that there was no longer any technical logic for the UHF discount to be restored (as UHF digital stations have typically maintained better signal quality compared to UHF transmissions in analog) and would trigger a wave of [[mergers and acquisitions]] in the broadcast television industry that would result in fewer diverse station owners.
